[1] "High electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity of 92.1% and propene formation rate of 20.5 mol g−1Pt h−1 at 600 °C."
[2] "The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters are the active sites for PDH reaction."
[3] "The restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles."
[4] "However, the surface Pt species of this catalyst usually suffer from poor recyclability and inferior stability during high-temperature reactions."
[5] "This catalyst is composed of confined ultra-small GaPt alloy nanoclusters and a part of isolated tetrahedral coordination of Ga species."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by anchoring the metal compounds onto the surface of the crystal through hydroxyl groups. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
2. The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters within the silicalite-1 zeolite act as the active sites for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. Their high electron density boosts the desorption of products, contributing to the high propene selectivity and formation rate at 600 °C.
3. The restriction of the zeolite enhances the regeneration stability of the GaPt@S-1 catalyst, allowing the catalytic activity to remain unchanged after four consecutive cycles.
4. The surface Pt species of the catalyst often exhibit poor recyclability and inferior stability during high-temperature reactions, which is an issue that needs to be addressed.
5. The GaPt@S-1 catalyst consists of confined ultra-small GaPt alloy nanoclusters and a portion of isolated tetrahedral coordination of Ga species.

1. 氢氧基锚定方法通过氢氧基团将活性金属化合物锚定在晶体表面，从而实现对晶体材料中活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这增强了金属-支撑之间的相互作用，提高了异质催化剂在固-气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。
2. 封闭的GaPt合金纳米簇位于丝光沸石1型沸石中，是丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应的活性位点。其高电子密度促进了产物的脱附，有助于在600 °C时获得高丙烯选择性和形成速率。
3. 沸石的限制提高了GaPt@S-1催化剂的再生稳定性，使得在四个连续周期后催化活性保持不变。
4. 催化剂表面的Pt物种在高温反应中往往表现出较差的可回收性和稳定性，这是需要解决的问题。
5. GaPt@S-1催化剂由封闭的超小型GaPt合金纳米簇和Ga物种的部分四面体协调组成。
