2.1. Catalyst preparation
Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure [38]. The GaPt@S-1 catalyst was prepared with the weight composition of 1.0 SiO2: 1.4 TPAOH: 10.5 H2O: 0.046 x [Ga(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)3: 0.025 y [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 (x and y are the weight ratio of Ga and Pt in the mixture, respectively) under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170 C for 4 d.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through precise control over the weight ratio of Ga and Pt in the mixture. This method leads to enhanced metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By preparing the GaPt@S-1 catalyst under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170°C for 4 days, the authors achieve a catalyst that exhibits excellent catalytic performance and high stability during propane dehydrogenation.
