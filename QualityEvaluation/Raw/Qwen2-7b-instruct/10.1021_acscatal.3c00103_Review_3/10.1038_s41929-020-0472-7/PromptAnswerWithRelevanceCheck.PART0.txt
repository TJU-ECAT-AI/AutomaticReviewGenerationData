The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement of the metals within the crystal lattice. This method enhances metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The incorporation of a second metal, as seen in the case of Pt and Sn, modulates the electronic structure of the pristine metals and influences their catalytic behavior. The in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies reveal the dynamic changes in the structure and electronic properties of the metal clusters upon hydrogen reduction, indicating the modulation of their catalytic activity. The CO adsorption and infrared spectroscopy results further support the interaction between Pt clusters and reduced Sn species, suggesting a reorganization of the electronic structure. The location of PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, along with the minimal interaction between the two metals, leads to enhanced stability against coke formation. The high initial activity, selectivity, and stability of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst, even under industrially relevant conditions, highlight the effectiveness of this method in catalysis.

[1] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[2] "The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ XAS. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appearance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1)."
[3] "Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 1116)"
[4] "The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge XAS. Sn is inferred to be Sn(IV) in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, as indicated by the pronounced white line in the XANES spectra (Fig. 2c)."
[5] "After treatment with H2 at 600C, the Sn(IV) species are reduced to Sn species with an average of approximately three SnO bonds, according to the EXAFS data (Table 1), and a white line intensity that matches that of Sn(II) in a bulk SnO2 standard."
[6] "The K-PtSn@MFI samples were also characterized after the propane dehydrogenation tests by STEM. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 5257, no sintering of the Pt clusters into larger particles was observed in any of the samples after propane dehydrogenation, and the location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinusoidal channels is also preserved, further confirming their high stability (Supplementary Figs. 5861)."
[7] "From a structural point of view, the PtSn clusters are mainly located in the sinusoidal channels. Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by precisely positioning and anchoring them within the crystal lattice structure. This ensures optimized metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method achieves this by utilizing the hydroxyl groups of the crystal material to selectively bind and stabilize the metal compounds, creating a stable interface that supports the active sites effectively. The precise control over the metal placement and orientation within the crystal structure allows for the creation of tailored catalysts with improved performance characteristics. Additionally, the hydroxyl anchoring method enables the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to sintering and improved resistance to coke formation, which is crucial for maintaining activity and selectivity over extended periods of use in industrial applications.

[1] "Structural modulation and direct measurement of subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters confined in zeolites Modulating the structures of subnanometric metal clusters at the atomic level is a great synthetic and characterization challenge in catalysis."
[2] "By tuning the procedure for preparing the bimetallic nanoparticles or by post-synthetic treatments, the spatial distribution of the two elements as well as their chemical states can be modified and, thus, their reactivity."
[3] "Under reaction conditions, structural transformation and reconstruction of the metal ensembles may also occur, which may result in further changes of the catalytic behaviour with time on stream."
[4] "Main It has been demonstrated in numerous systems that the introduction of a second metal into nanoparticulate metal catalysts can substantially modulate the electronic structure of pristine metals and further influence their catalytic behaviour1."

[7] "We note that a small fraction of larger particles coexist with the very small clusters in all these samples, leading to an average EXAFS coordination number slightly larger than that one would expect for Pt clusters of 0.50.6nm."
[8] "Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 1116)"
[9] "Interestingly, these properties can be controlled by varying the reduction time, following a change in structure that is too subtle to be detected by EXAFS24."
[10] "To avoid the oxidation of PtSn clusters in air, TEM experiments were carried out using a vacuum transfer TEM holder when transferring the reduced sample into the microscope (see details in Supplementary Fig. 19)25,26."
[11] "As shown in Supplementary Figs. 2023, these quasi in situ TEM experiments revealed well-distributed subnanometric Pt clusters that are located in the 10R sinusoidal channels, according to the STEM-iDPC images (Supplementary Figs. 2431)."
[12] "For comparison, we also carried out the same K-means clustering analysis on the HR-HAADF-STEM images of samples that were exposed to atmospheric air after H2 treatment and prior to introduction into the microscope (see Fig. 3eh)."
[13] "When the reduced samples were exposed to atmospheric air, the number of Sn in close proximity to Pt decayed markedly (Fig. 4)."
[14] "Nevertheless, the percentages of PtSn contacts in K-PtSn@MFI samples measured under quasi in situ conditions are clearly higher than the values obtained in the corresponding ex situ experiments, confirming the influence of the reduction on the spatial relationship between Pt and Sn species, and stressing the need to protect the reduced sample from air to obtain reliable results."
[15] "The formation of interactions between Pt clusters and partially reduced Sn species during the H2 treatment is also reflected in the changes in the CO absorption bands in the range 1,8501,650cm1."
[16] "The CO bands in this range should be associated with the CO adsorbed on the metal clusters32,33,34."
[17] "Nevertheless, the formation of PtSn nanoparticles is confirmed by the decrease in the CO-IR band at 2,018cm1 in the K-PtSn@MFI samples on increasing the reduction time from 1 to 3h."
[18] "The contribution of this band, which corresponds to CO adsorbed on highly under-coordinated Pt sites of nanoparticles35, decreases notably when the K-PtSn@MFI sample is reduced for 3h at 600C by H2, as more Sn adds to the cluster and inhibits the adsorption of CO on the adjacent Pt atoms36,37,38."
[19] "The formation of Pt clusters interacting with partially reduced Sn species in the reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples can also be inferred from the CO chemisorption results."
[20] "According to all the spectroscopic results discussed above (Sn-edge XANES and EXAFS, CO-IR), it can be concluded that pre-reduction treatment induces the reduction of Sn(IV) species in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI sample and that the reduced Sn species can interact with subnanometric Pt clusters."

[22] "From a structural point of view, the PtSn clusters are mainly located in the sinusoidal channels."
[23] "Because the deposition of coke on Pt-based catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction is related to the chemical composition of the bimetallic PtM particles47, the results presented indicate that a minimal interaction between the two metals is sufficient to suppress most of the coke formation, provided that the active species remain small (in the subnanometric regime) during the lifetime of the catalyst ."
[24] "Finally, to show the potential of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst activated under the optimized conditions, we tested the catalytic performance of K-PtSn@MFI under more industrially relevant conditions (for example, no N2 dilution) for the propane dehydrogenation reaction."
[25] "The geometric and electronic structures of subnanometric bimetallic clusters in confined space may be different from the corresponding nanoparticles supported on open-structure carriers, which can lead to unique reactivity."
[26] "Combining multiple in situ characterization techniques (both averaging techniques such as EXAFS and site-specific techniques such as IR and TEM) is critical to elucidating the nature of the active sites in supported catalysts containing isolated atoms and/or clusters48."
