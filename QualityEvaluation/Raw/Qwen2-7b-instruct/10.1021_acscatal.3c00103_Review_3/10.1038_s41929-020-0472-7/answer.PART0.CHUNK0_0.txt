The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement of the metals within the crystal lattice. This method enhances metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The incorporation of a second metal, as seen in the case of Pt and Sn, modulates the electronic structure of the pristine metals and influences their catalytic behavior. The in situ X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies reveal the dynamic changes in the structure and electronic properties of the metal clusters upon hydrogen reduction, indicating the modulation of their catalytic activity. The CO adsorption and infrared spectroscopy results further support the interaction between Pt clusters and reduced Sn species, suggesting a reorganization of the electronic structure. The location of PtSn clusters in the sinusoidal channels of the zeolite structure, along with the minimal interaction between the two metals, leads to enhanced stability against coke formation. The high initial activity, selectivity, and stability of the K-PtSn@MFI catalyst, even under industrially relevant conditions, highlight the effectiveness of this method in catalysis.
