How does the hydroxyl anchoring method facilitate the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials, and what are its implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions?

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components within crystal structures. This process strengthens the connections between metals and supports, thereby enhancing their interactions. As a result, the activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significantly improved.
