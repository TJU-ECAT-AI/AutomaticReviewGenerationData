[1] "In this work we have investigated how modulating the exact interaction between the Pt and Sn in subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.50.6nm), located regioselectively in the sinusoidal 10R channels of pure silica MFI zeolite, is key to achieving optimal catalytic performance."
[2] "The chemical states of Pt in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample during H2 reduction at 600C were investigated by in situ XAS. It was found that, regardless of the reduction time, the Pt species in the K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample were completely reduced to metallic Pt at 600C (ref. 14), as inferred by the intensity of the white line in the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra compared with a Pt foil reference (Fig. 2a) and the appearance of PtPt contributions in the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra (Fig. 2b and Table 1)."
[3] "Analysis of the STEM-iDPC (combination of HR-HAADF-STEM and iDPC) images indicates that the Pt clusters in these reduced K-PtSn@MFI samples are in the 10R sinusoidal channels, regardless of the H2 reduction time at 600C (Fig. 1et and Supplementary Figs. 1116)"
[4] "The nature of the Sn species and their coordination environments in the K-PtSn@MFI samples were also studied by Sn K-edge XAS. Sn is inferred to be Sn(IV) in the pristine K-PtSn@MFI-Air sample, as indicated by the pronounced white line in the XANES spectra (Fig. 2c)."
[5] "After treatment with H2 at 600C, the Sn(IV) species are reduced to Sn species with an average of approximately three SnO bonds, according to the EXAFS data (Table 1), and a white line intensity that matches that of Sn(II) in a bulk SnO2 standard."
[6] "The K-PtSn@MFI samples were also characterized after the propane dehydrogenation tests by STEM. As shown in Supplementary Figs. 5257, no sintering of the Pt clusters into larger particles was observed in any of the samples after propane dehydrogenation, and the location of PtSn clusters in the 10R sinusoidal channels is also preserved, further confirming their high stability (Supplementary Figs. 5861)."
[7] "From a structural point of view, the PtSn clusters are mainly located in the sinusoidal channels. Even though coke formation is associated with catalytic events occurring at the metal surface, the resulting carbonaceous species seem not to remain directly blocking the active sites."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by precisely positioning and anchoring them within the crystal lattice structure. This ensures optimized metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method achieves this by utilizing the hydroxyl groups of the crystal material to selectively bind and stabilize the metal compounds, creating a stable interface that supports the active sites effectively. The precise control over the metal placement and orientation within the crystal structure allows for the creation of tailored catalysts with improved performance characteristics. Additionally, the hydroxyl anchoring method enables the design of catalysts with enhanced resistance to sintering and improved resistance to coke formation, which is crucial for maintaining activity and selectivity over extended periods of use in industrial applications.
