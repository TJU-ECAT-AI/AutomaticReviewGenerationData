The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise control over their placement. This method enables the formation of strong interactions between the metal species and the support matrix, which enhances their interactions. As a result, it leads to improved catalytic performance, resulting in higher activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
