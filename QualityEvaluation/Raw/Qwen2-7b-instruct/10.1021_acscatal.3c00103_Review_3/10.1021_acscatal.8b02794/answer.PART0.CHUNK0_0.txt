<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise addition of active metal components within crystal structures. This technique strengthens the bond between metals and supports, thereby boosting the performance of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. It leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability of these catalysts.
