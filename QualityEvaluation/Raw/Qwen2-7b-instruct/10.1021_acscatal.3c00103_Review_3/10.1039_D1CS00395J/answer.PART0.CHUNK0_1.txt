[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using hydroxyl groups to anchor the metal compounds onto the surface of the crystal. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the systematic addition of active metal components to crystal structures by leveraging hydroxyl groups to attach these metals to the crystal surface. This technique strengthens the interaction between metals and supports, thereby enhancing the performance of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by boosting their activity, selectivity, and durability.
