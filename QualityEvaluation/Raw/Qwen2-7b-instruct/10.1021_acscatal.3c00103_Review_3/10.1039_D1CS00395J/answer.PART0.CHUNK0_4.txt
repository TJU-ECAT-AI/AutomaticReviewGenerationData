[1] "The main techniques used to characterize defects in zeolites are X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis, FTIR and NMR and DFT."
[2] "While hierarchical zeolites, albeit used already in their first industrial applications in the early 1960's, have been studied extensively in the last decade to promote faster molecular traffic in zeolites by lowering diffusion limitations, the concomitant production of defects has not yet received the attention as it deserves."

Defects in zeolites can enhance metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. This is facilitated by the hydroxyl anchoring method, which allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials. By anchoring the metals through hydroxyl groups, the method strengthens the metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced performance of the catalysts in various industrial processes. This is particularly advantageous in applications requiring high efficiency and stability, such as catalytic conversions in petrochemical industries and environmental remediation processes.
