[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a strong interaction between the metal and the support through the formation of metal-oxygen bonds. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components into crystal matrices by establishing robust metal-oxygen bonds, thereby strengthening the interaction between the metal and the support. This enhancement in interaction boosts the activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts involved in solid-gas reactions.
