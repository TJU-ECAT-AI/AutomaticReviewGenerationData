[1] "The presence of defects in zeolites is related to the synthesis and post-synthesis treatment methods applied."
[2] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using the hydroxyl groups as anchoring points for the metal compounds."
[3] "This method enhances metal-support interactions, which can lead to improvements in the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the controlled addition of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups as attachment points. This technique strengthens the interaction between the metal and the support, potentially boosting the catalyst's activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions.
