Silanols (SiOH) are observed at crystal terminations, while connectivity defects (geminal, vicinal, bridged and cluster types) occur when one or more TOT bonds are missing in the zeolite framework structures. The main techniques used to characterize defects in zeolites are X-ray diffraction, UV-Vis, FTIR, and NMR, and DFT. The best strategy to describe zeolite defects is their combination as each one highlights a specific feature such as dynamics, atomic, and structural. Emerging and powerful new TEM methodologies are now available to locate hydrogen atoms and their further development will most probably add rich information on the structure of isolated or clustered hydrogen groups.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the zeolite. These hydroxyl groups serve as anchoring points for the metal compounds, enhancing the metal-support interactions. This method can improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by ensuring a more uniform and stable distribution of the metal compounds within the zeolite structure. The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for precise control over the metal loading, positioning, and orientation, which in turn optimizes the catalytic performance of the zeolite catalysts. This approach is particularly useful in applications requiring high catalytic efficiency and robustness, such as in the petrochemical industry and renewable energy technologies.
