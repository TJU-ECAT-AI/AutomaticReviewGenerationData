[1] "SOMC, and the combination of SOMC & TMP, have been shown to provide molecular level insight into the structure and nature of active centres for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes for the two classes of dehydrogenation catalysts based on isolated sites or supported Pt nanoparticles."
[2] "Through the systematic use of tailored molecular precursors, and rigorous characterization of materials at every step of the synthesis, it has been possible to obtain valuable insight into dehydrogenation processes using model catalysts."
[3] "This insight indicates that isolated metal ions are proficient in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and that there is most likely a non-redox mechanism that enables this reactivity."
[4] "It has been shown, by using this molecular approach, that alloying, as a general strategy possible with an array of metals (Sn, Ga, Zn), enables the synthesis of more active, selective and stable catalysts for PDH."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the support. This method allows for the precise placement of metal compounds, enhancing metal-support interactions. By doing so, it improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The implications include the ability to precisely tailor the catalyst's surface properties, leading to optimized performance in catalytic processes. Alloying, as demonstrated using this molecular approach, acts as an effective strategy for diluting Pt centers at the surface of supported nanoparticles. This reduces cracking and coke formation, enhances selectivity, and offers superior stability compared to existing catalysts. The remaining dispersed Lewis acidic sites on the surface act as anchoring sites for alloyed nanoparticles, reducing sintering and contributing to the catalyst's stability.
