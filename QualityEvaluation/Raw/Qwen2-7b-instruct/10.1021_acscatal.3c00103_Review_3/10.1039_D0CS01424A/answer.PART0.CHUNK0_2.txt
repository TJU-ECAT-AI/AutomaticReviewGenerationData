[1] "SOMC, and the combination of SOMC & TMP, have been shown to provide molecular level insight into the structure and nature of active centres for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes for the two classes of dehydrogenation catalysts based on isolated sites or supported Pt nanoparticles."
[2] "This insight indicates that isolated metal ions are proficient in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and that there is most likely a non-redox mechanism that enables this reactivity."
[3] "For multimetallic systems based on Pt-nanoparticles, the SOMC approach has been able to show, by using detailed spectroscopic study, that the presence of an alloyed PtM phase is critical to the stability of Pt-based systems."
[4] "It has been shown, by using this molecular approach, that alloying serves as an effective strategy for the dilution of Pt centres at the surface of the supported nanoparticles."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise attachment of metal compounds to the surface of the support through covalent bonding. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method enables direct comparison of materials with identical compositions except for the dopant, which is crucial for understanding the role of specific components in catalyst performance. The controlled synthesis of active sites, isolated metal ions, and supported nanoparticles through SOMC provides molecular-level insights into the structure and reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, guiding the design of improved catalysts. Alloying is shown to be an effective strategy for diluting Pt centers, suppressing cracking and coke formation, and enhancing selectivity by serving as an anchoring site for nanoparticles, thus reducing sintering.

氢氧基锚定方法通过允许金属化合物精确地附着到支持物表面，从而增强金属-支持物之间的相互作用，进而提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。这种方法允许对除掺杂剂外所有成分都相同的材料进行直接比较，这对于理解特定成分在催化剂性能中的作用至关重要。通过SOMC方法系统地合成活性位点、孤立金属离子和支持纳米颗粒提供了异质催化剂结构和反应性的分子级洞察，指导了更佳催化剂的设计。合金化被证明是一种有效策略，可以稀释Pt中心，抑制裂解和焦炭形成，并通过作为纳米粒子的锚定点增强选择性，从而减少烧结。
