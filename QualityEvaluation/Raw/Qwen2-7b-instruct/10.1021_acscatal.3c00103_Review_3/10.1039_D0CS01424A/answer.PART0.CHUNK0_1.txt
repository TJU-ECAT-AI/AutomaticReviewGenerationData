[1] "SOMC, and the combination of SOMC & TMP, have been shown to provide molecular level insight into the structure and nature of active centres for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes for the two classes of dehydrogenation catalysts based on isolated sites or supported Pt nanoparticles."
[2] "Through the systematic use of tailored molecular precursors, and rigorous characterization of materials at every step of the synthesis, it has been possible to obtain valuable insight into dehydrogenation processes using model catalysts."
[3] "Furthermore, the ability to systematically change a single component of a system (i.e. identity of dopant), while fixing all other variables other metals, surface area, metal loading etc.) enables direct comparison of otherwise identical materials."
[4] "Specifically, in the case of isolated metal sites (Mn+) on non-reducible supports, it has been possible to develop CrIII/MOx type catalysts, containing isolated metal ions which catalysethe dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[5] "For multimetallic systems based on Pt-nanoparticles, the SOMC approach has been able to show, by using detailed spectroscopic study, that the presence of an alloyed PtM phase is critical to the stability of Pt-based systems."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing the precise attachment of metal compounds to the support surface through covalent bonding. This method improves metal-support interactions by creating strong covalent links, which in turn enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By systematically varying dopants while keeping other factors constant, researchers can directly compare catalysts, gaining insights into the structure-reactivity relationships. The use of this method in synthesizing catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes has led to the development of isolated metal ion catalysts and multimetallic systems based on Pt nanoparticles. The latter has shown that alloyed phases of Pt and other metals are crucial for the stability of Pt-based catalysts, leading to the synthesis of more active, selective, and stable catalysts.

氢氧基锚定方法通过允许金属化合物精确地与支撑表面形成共价键，从而在晶体材料中实现活性金属化合物的可控集成。这种方法通过创建强大的共价链接来改善金属-支撑相互作用，进而提高固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过系统地改变掺杂剂，同时保持其他因素（如其他金属、表面积、负载量等）不变，研究者可以直接比较催化剂，从而获得结构-反应性关系的见解。这种方法在合成轻烷烃脱氢催化剂时的发展导致了孤立金属离子催化剂和基于铂纳米颗粒的多金属系统的开发。后者表明，铂和其他金属的合金相对于铂基催化剂的稳定性至关重要，导致了更活跃、更选择性和更稳定的催化剂的合成。
