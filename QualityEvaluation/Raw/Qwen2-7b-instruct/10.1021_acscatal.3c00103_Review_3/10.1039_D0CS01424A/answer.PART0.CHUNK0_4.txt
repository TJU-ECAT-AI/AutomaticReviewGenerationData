[1] "Through the design of molecular precursors, such as thermolytic molecular precursors (TMP),21,22 and rigorous characterization at every stage of synthesis, one is now able to selectively generate uniform supported, isolated species (so-called single sites) and supported metallic nanoparticles with a narrow particle size distribution, where the average particle size is largely independent of the dopant(s) and support."
[2] "This approach has been exploited for the synthesis of isolated Mn+ sites dispersed on oxide supports. Through the selective reaction of homoleptic metal siloxides, hydrocarbyls, alkoxides and aluminates with hydroxyl groups found on the surface of oxides (henceforth described as grafting), it has been possible to generate isolated surface species which can be subsequently thermally treated, under reduced pressure, inert or even reactive conditions (e.g. synthetic air), to generate well-defined surface sites of known oxidation state, geometry and nuclearity (Scheme 2a)."
[3] "Secondly, SOMC can also be used for the synthesis of supported metal nanoparticles. Following the grafting of late-transition metal precursors (siloxides, hydrocarbyls, alkoxides, amides etc.) through the surface hydroxyl groups of oxide supports, that enables the generation of materials with a uniform initial distribution of metal across the support, the treatment under hydrogen (typically 1 bar(a), in flow) at elevated temperatures yields small, uniform nanoparticles, free of organic ligands/capping agents (Scheme 2b)."
[4] "In this approach, materials denoted Mn+@MOx represent materials prepared by SOMC that have been fully characterized after post-treatment (i.e. in the state that they would be in upon exposure to reaction gas), while the / notation is used where either (a) the grafted species, prepared by SOMC, was only characterized prior to pretreatment, or (b) the material was prepared by conventional impregnation methods (further denoted (IWI))."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by using molecular precursors like thermolytic molecular precursors (TMP) and carefully characterizing the synthesis stages. This enables the selective creation of isolated species, like single sites, and metallic nanoparticles with consistent particle sizes. The method exploits the selective reaction of metal precursors with hydroxyl groups on oxide surfaces, allowing the formation of isolated surface species with defined oxidation states, geometries, and nuclearities. Additionally, treating these materials under hydrogen at high temperatures generates small, uniform nanoparticles without organic ligands or capping agents. This approach ensures that the average particle size is independent of dopants and supports, enhancing metal-support interactions and potentially improving catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability.

羟基锚定方法通过使用分子前体，如热解分子前体（TMP），并仔细表征合成阶段来促进活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控掺入。这种方法允许选择性地生成孤立物种，如单个站点和具有均匀颗粒大小的金属纳米粒子。该方法利用金属前体与氧化物表面上的羟基的选择性反应，使形成具有已知氧化状态、几何形状和核度的孤立表面物种成为可能。此外，通过在高温下对这些材料进行氢处理，可以产生没有有机配体或包覆剂的小而均匀的纳米粒子。这种方法确保了平均颗粒大小不受掺杂剂和支持体的影响，从而增强金属-支持相互作用，并可能提高催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。
