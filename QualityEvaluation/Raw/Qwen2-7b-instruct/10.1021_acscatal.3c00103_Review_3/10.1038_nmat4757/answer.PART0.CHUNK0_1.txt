The hydroxyl anchoring method enables precise integration of active metal compounds within crystal structures by leveraging the hydroxyl groups on crystal surfaces. This approach strengthens the interaction between metals and supports, which in turn enhances the catalyst's performance in solid-gas reactions by boosting its activity, selectivity, and stability.
