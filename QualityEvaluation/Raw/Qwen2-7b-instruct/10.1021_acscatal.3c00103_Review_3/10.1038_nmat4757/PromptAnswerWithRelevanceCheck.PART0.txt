The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups present on the crystal surface to anchor the metal species, thus enhancing metal-support interactions. This approach improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by providing a strong and selective binding site for the metal species. The hydroxyl anchoring ensures that the metal compounds are precisely positioned and stabilized within the crystal structure, allowing for better control over their reactivity and resistance to degradation during high-temperature operations. As a result, the method enables the development of more efficient and durable catalysts suitable for a wide range of industrial applications.

[10] "The resultant mixture was heated at 52C, stirring vigorously, for 16h to facilitate the swelling of the layers of the precursor material."
[11] "To prepare the swelled purely siliceous ITQ-1 with subnanometric Pt species, 2g of the lamellar precursor was dispersed in 8g of H2O milliQ, and 40 g of a cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide solution (25 wt%, 50% exchanged Br/OH) and 12g of a solution of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (40 wt%, 30% exchanged Br/OH) were added together with 40ml of Pt-DMF solution, the final pH being around 12.5."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the precise structure of the zeolite framework to confine the metal species within its cavities. This approach improves metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. Specifically, by encapsulating metal clusters and individual atoms within the zeolite's internal spaces, the method ensures that these active sites remain protected from sintering and other forms of degradation at high temperatures. This encapsulation is achieved through the synthesis of zeolite materials that contain cavities with specific dimensions, which can precisely accommodate the desired metal species. As a result, the metal-support interactions are optimized, allowing for the effective utilization of metal compounds in catalytic processes. Additionally, the use of hydroxyl anchoring methods enables the stabilization of metal clusters, which are typically prone to instability at elevated temperatures, thereby extending their applicability in heterogeneous catalysis. The encapsulation of metal species within zeolites also facilitates the control of their location within the catalyst, ensuring that they are optimally positioned for efficient interaction with reactants in solid-gas reactions. This method has been successfully applied to synthesize Al-containing zeolites, demonstrating its effectiveness in preparing catalysts with high stability and activity, particularly in dehydrogenation reactions of propane to propylene.
