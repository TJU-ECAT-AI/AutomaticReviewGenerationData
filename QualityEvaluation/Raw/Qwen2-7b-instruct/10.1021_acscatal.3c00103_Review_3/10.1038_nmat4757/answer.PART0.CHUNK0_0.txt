[1] "However, the stability of metal clusters can be a limitation for their applications in heterogeneous catalysis at higher temperatures."
[2] "Loading atomically dispersed metal species on solid supports can be a method to improve their stability."
[3] "In this respect, because of their high thermal stability and confinement effects, zeolite materials appear as promising supports for preparing supported metal clusters."
[4] "Nevertheless, in some cases, the introduction of Al into the zeolites may restrict the reaction scope of these materials because of the acidity associated with the presence of Al sites."
[5] "It will be shown that subnanometric Pt species in the cavities can differentiate reactants by size and show exceptional high thermal stability and better catalytic activity."
[6] "The stability and catalytic activity of encapsulated Pt species is also reflected in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups present on the crystal surface to anchor the metal species, thus enhancing metal-support interactions. This approach improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by providing a strong and selective binding site for the metal species. The hydroxyl anchoring ensures that the metal compounds are precisely positioned and stabilized within the crystal structure, allowing for better control over their reactivity and resistance to degradation during high-temperature operations. As a result, the method enables the development of more efficient and durable catalysts suitable for a wide range of industrial applications.
