[1] "However, the stability of metal clusters can be a limitation for their applications in heterogeneous catalysis at higher temperatures."
[2] "Loading atomically dispersed metal species on solid supports can be a method to improve their stability."
[3] "By conventional methods (such as wet impregnation and ion exchange), the location of metal species cannot always be controlled, and metal NPs will usually be formed after the post-treatment."
[4] "Nevertheless, in some cases, the introduction of Al into the zeolites may restrict the reaction scope of these materials because of the acidity associated with the presence of Al sites."
[5] "This method has been used, so far, for the synthesis of Al-containing zeolites, and the metal nanoparticles encapsulated in those zeolites are resistant to sintering."
[6] "As the starting material, we choose a pure siliceous layered precursor of MCM-22 (MWW-type zeolite)15 with the idea that, during the condensation of the layered zeolite precursor, the hemi-cages (cups) and cageswith internal dimensions of 0.7 and 0.7 × 1.8nm, respectivelywould entrap the subnanometric Pt species."
[7] "It has been reported that subnanometric metal species (single atoms and clusters) are unstable above 250C (refs 24,25,26)."
[8] "The stability and catalytic activity of encapsulated Pt species is also reflected in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[9] "The synthesis of ITQ-1 using TMAda+, HMI and Na+ cations is as follows: 0.95g of NaCl was dissolved in 50.70g of a solution 0.42M of N, N, N-trimethyl-1-adamantanamonium hydroxide, previously diluted with 21.33g of water."
[10] "The resultant mixture was heated at 52C, stirring vigorously, for 16h to facilitate the swelling of the layers of the precursor material."
[11] "To prepare the swelled purely siliceous ITQ-1 with subnanometric Pt species, 2g of the lamellar precursor was dispersed in 8g of H2O milliQ, and 40 g of a cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide solution (25 wt%, 50% exchanged Br/OH) and 12g of a solution of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (40 wt%, 30% exchanged Br/OH) were added together with 40ml of Pt-DMF solution, the final pH being around 12.5."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the precise structure of the zeolite framework to confine the metal species within its cavities. This approach improves metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. Specifically, by encapsulating metal clusters and individual atoms within the zeolite's internal spaces, the method ensures that these active sites remain protected from sintering and other forms of degradation at high temperatures. This encapsulation is achieved through the synthesis of zeolite materials that contain cavities with specific dimensions, which can precisely accommodate the desired metal species. As a result, the metal-support interactions are optimized, allowing for the effective utilization of metal compounds in catalytic processes. Additionally, the use of hydroxyl anchoring methods enables the stabilization of metal clusters, which are typically prone to instability at elevated temperatures, thereby extending their applicability in heterogeneous catalysis. The encapsulation of metal species within zeolites also facilitates the control of their location within the catalyst, ensuring that they are optimally positioned for efficient interaction with reactants in solid-gas reactions. This method has been successfully applied to synthesize Al-containing zeolites, demonstrating its effectiveness in preparing catalysts with high stability and activity, particularly in dehydrogenation reactions of propane to propylene.
