The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement within the crystal lattice structure. This technique strengthens the interaction between metal components and the supporting material, leading to enhanced performance of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The improved activity, selectivity, and stability are direct outcomes of these strengthened interactions.
