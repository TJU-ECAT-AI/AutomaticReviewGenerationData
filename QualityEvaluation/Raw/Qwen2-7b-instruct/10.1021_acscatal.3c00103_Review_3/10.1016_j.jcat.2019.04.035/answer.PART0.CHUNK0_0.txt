[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method involves the use of hydroxyl groups to facilitate the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials."
[2] "This method enables precise placement of metal ions within the crystal structure, enhancing metal-support interactions."
[3] "By controlling the distribution of metal compounds, the hydroxyl anchoring technique improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement of metal ions within the crystal structure. This enhances metal-support interactions, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
