      <English>
          The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials via a precise and selective attachment mechanism, which strengthens covalent bonds between metal species and the crystal surface, enhancing metal-support interactions. This technique improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. Optimizing the distribution and bonding of active metals through this method results in more efficient catalytic processes with higher yields and reduced side reactions.
