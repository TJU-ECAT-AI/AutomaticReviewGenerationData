The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through the introduction of hydroxyl groups onto the surface of the support material. These hydroxyl groups act as strong binding sites for metal ions, enabling precise tuning of the interaction between the metal and the support. By adjusting the density and distribution of hydroxyl groups, one can enhance metal-support interactions, which leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts. In solid-gas reactions, these enhanced interactions result in more efficient conversion rates and product yields.
