The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through the introduction of hydroxyl groups onto the surface of the support material. These hydroxyl groups act as strong binding sites for metal ions, enabling precise tuning of the interaction between the metal and the support. By adjusting the density and distribution of hydroxyl groups, one can enhance metal-support interactions, which leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts. In solid-gas reactions, these enhanced interactions result in more efficient conversion rates and product yields.

羟基锚定方法通过在支撑材料表面引入羟基团，使活性金属化合物能够被精确地整合到晶体材料中。这些羟基团作为金属离子的强大结合点，促进金属与支撑材料之间的相互作用。通过调整羟基团的密度和分布，可以增强金属-支撑相互作用，从而提高异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。在固-气反应中，这些增强的相互作用导致更高效的转化率和产物产率。
