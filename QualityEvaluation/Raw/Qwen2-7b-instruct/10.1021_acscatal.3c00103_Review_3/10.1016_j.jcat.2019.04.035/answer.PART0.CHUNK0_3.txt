The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise placement within crystal structures. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved performance in heterogeneous catalysis. The enhanced interactions increase the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
