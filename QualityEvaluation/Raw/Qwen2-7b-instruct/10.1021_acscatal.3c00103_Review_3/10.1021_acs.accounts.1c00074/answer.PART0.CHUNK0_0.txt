(1) "In this process, protons in zeolite micropores are crucial to the individual step of H2O2 formation (H2 + O2  H2O2), a reaction that thermodynamically tends to form water rather than H2O2 (Figure 6a)."
(2) "The more obvious kinetic isotope effect on water than hydrogen (kH2O/kD2O > kH2/kD2) suggests water-assisted proton transfer to be a crucial step."
(3) "Considering the hydrophilicity of H2O2, we constructed a hydrophobic sheath around the zeolite crystals to hinder the H2O2 diffusion (Figure 5a)."

1. Protons in zeolite micropores play a critical role in the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2) in a process that thermodynamically prefers the formation of water over H2O2.

2. The greater kinetic isotope effect observed in water compared to hydrogen indicates that water-assisted proton transfer is a key step in this process.

3. Given the hydrophilic nature of hydrogen peroxide, a hydrophobic layer was developed to obstruct the diffusion of hydrogen peroxide around the zeolite crystals.

1. 石英微孔中的质子在从氢(H2)和氧(O2)形成过氧化氢(H2O2)的过程中起着至关重要的作用，这一过程从热力学角度看更倾向于生成水而非H2O2。

2. 水与氢的明显更大的同位素效应表明，水辅助的质子转移是这一过程中一个关键步骤。

3. 考虑到过氧化氢的亲水性，开发了一层疏水性外层来阻止氢过氧化物在石英晶体周围的扩散。
