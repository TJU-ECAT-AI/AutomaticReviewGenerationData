(1) "In this process, protons in zeolite micropores are crucial to the individual step of H2O2 formation (H2 + O2  H2O2), a reaction that thermodynamically tends to form water rather than H2O2 (Figure 6a)."
(2) "The more obvious kinetic isotope effect on water than hydrogen (kH2O/kD2O > kH2/kD2) suggests water-assisted proton transfer to be a crucial step."
(3) "Considering the hydrophilicity of H2O2, we constructed a hydrophobic sheath around the zeolite crystals to hinder the H2O2 diffusion (Figure 5a)."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by ensuring precise placement and anchoring of the metal species within the crystal lattice. This is achieved through a chemical bonding process that exploits the hydroxyl groups present in the crystal structure. By doing so, it enhances the metal-support interactions, which are critical for the stability and activity of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The improved metal-support interactions lead to better dispersion of metal species, reduced agglomeration, and increased surface area availability, thereby enhancing the catalyst's activity and selectivity. Additionally, the hydroxyl anchoring method ensures that the metal compounds are not only incorporated but also stabilized within the crystal matrix, contributing to the catalyst's overall stability and durability under reaction conditions.

The implications of this method for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are profound. It enables the development of more efficient and robust catalysts that can withstand harsh reaction environments, operate with high selectivity towards desired products, and maintain their performance over multiple reaction cycles. This method also facilitates the rational design of catalysts tailored for specific applications, offering a systematic approach to optimize catalyst performance based on the crystal structure's properties and the desired catalytic activity.

In summary, the hydroxyl anchoring method provides a powerful tool for controlling the incorporation of metal compounds in crystal materials, leading to enhanced metal-support interactions, improved catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions.
