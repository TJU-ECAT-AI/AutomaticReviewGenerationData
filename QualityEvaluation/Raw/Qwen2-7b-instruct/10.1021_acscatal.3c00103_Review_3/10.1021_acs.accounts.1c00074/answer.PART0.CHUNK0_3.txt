(519) In addition, the solid support is also a key factor in the catalytic performance because it not only provides a large surface for dispersing metal species but also electronically and/or geometrically modifies the metal nanoparticles via the strong metalsupport interactions.
(1) Zeolite with a hydrophobic sheath efficiently enriched hydrogen peroxide that was produced in situ on the AuPd nanoparticles in zeolite crystals, boosting the methane oxidation at low temperature.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating strong interactions between the metal compounds and the crystal lattice. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. For instance, the hydrophobic zeolite sheath efficiently enriched hydrogen peroxide produced in situ on the AuPd nanoparticles, thereby boosting methane oxidation at low temperatures.

羟基锚定方法通过在晶材料中创建金属化合物与晶格之间的强烈相互作用，实现了活性金属组分的可控掺入。这增强了金属-支撑相互作用，从而提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。例如，疏水性沸石壳有效地富集了原位产生的过氧化氢，进而促进了低温条件下的甲烷氧化。
