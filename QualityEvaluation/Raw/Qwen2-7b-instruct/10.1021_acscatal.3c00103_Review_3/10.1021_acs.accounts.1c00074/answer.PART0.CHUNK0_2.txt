1. The hydrophobic siliceous zeolite micropores facilitate the separation of water and ethanol, which enhances the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
2. The zeolite micropores enable the diffusion of reactants to metal nanoparticles, creating an optimal local environment for reactions.
3. Metal nanoparticles are securely enclosed within the zeolite rigid framework, preventing their migration under harsh reaction conditions and describing this as a fixed structure.
4. Zeolite micropores act as diffusion channels for reactants and products, providing a localized environment for the reaction to occur.
5. Zeolites' rigid frameworks and high thermal stability contribute to stabilizing metal nanoparticles via the fixed structure, improving catalyst performance.
