[1] "In order to evaluate the chemical environment of Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite, UVvis analysis was performed with selected samples and the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (c)."
[2] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2."
[3] "The local electronic environment of Pt is of great significance for PDH process. In this study, the local electronic environment of Pt was investigated by FTIR spectra of CO adsorption, which is reliable for the discrimination of highly dispersed Pt centers and large metal bulks even at very low Pt loading."
[4] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation. On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

1. The UVvis analysis was utilized to assess the chemical surroundings of Zn species on the Si-Beta zeolite, revealing their dispersion and interaction with the silanols through the formation of Si-O-Zn linkages.
2. Electron microscopy provided direct insights into the morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of both Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support, showing small aggregates and homogenous distribution.
3. The CO adsorption FTIR spectra were used to explore the local electronic environment of Pt, highlighting the importance of highly dispersed Pt centers for the PDH process and confirming their presence on the zeolite support.
4. The study concluded that coke deposition is not the primary cause of the catalytic deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst during the PDH reaction. Instead, the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species are identified as the key factors leading to the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst.

1. 对于Si-Beta沸石上的Zn物种的化学环境，通过UVvis分析进行了评估，揭示了它们的分散性和与硅醇的相互作用，通过形成Si-O-Zn键。
2. 电子显微镜直接揭示了沸石支持的形态以及Si-Beta支持上的Pt和Zn物种的分散情况，显示了小聚集体和均匀分布。
3. 通过对CO吸附的FTIR光谱的研究，探索了Pt的局部电子环境，强调了高度分散的Pt中心对于PDH过程的重要性，并证实了它们在沸石支持上的存在。
4. 研究结果表明，在PDH反应过程中，催化剂Pt-Zn/Si-Beta的失活主要不是由于焦炭沉积。相反，Zn物种的丢失和随后的Pt物种聚集被确定为导致催化剂不可逆失活的关键因素。
