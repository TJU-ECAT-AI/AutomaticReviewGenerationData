1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by stabilizing them through interactions with silanols derived from zeolite framework dealumination. This results in enhanced metal-support interactions, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by ensuring the homogeneous dispersion of active metal compounds.

2. The implications of this method for enhancing catalyst performance include achieving high propylene production rates, high propylene selectivities, and sustainable deactivation rates in PDH reactions. The method allows for the optimization of catalyst compositions and reaction parameters to achieve these desirable outcomes.

3. Zinc, as a highly abundant and non-toxic metal, is considered a promising modifier for Pt catalysts in PDH processes. However, its use receives less attention compared to post-transition metals like Gallium and Tin.

4. The deactivation of Pt-Sn catalysts is primarily associated with the migration of subnanometric Pt species rather than coke formation during PDH reactions, according to research by Weckhuysen and colleagues.

5. The performance of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst in PDH reactions is well explained by the unique properties of the catalyst composition and the reaction conditions.

6. Despite the deactivation of the catalyst, the BEA topology of the catalyst remains intact after PDH reactions, indicating that structural degradation is not the primary cause of deactivation.

7. The aggregation of Pt species observed in the spent catalyst suggests that there is a spatial separation between Pt and Zn species, leading to weakened Pt-Zn interaction.

8. The loss of Zn species during high-temperature PDH reactions is proposed as a factor contributing to the weakening of Pt-Zn interaction and the aggregation of Pt species in the catalyst, leading to deactivation.

1. 碱基锚定方法通过将活性金属化合物稳定在来源于沸石框架去铝化产生的硅醇上，促进了它们在晶体材料中的可控掺杂。这种方法增强了金属载体间的相互作用，进而改善了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性，确保了活性金属化合物的均匀分散。

2. 该方法对催化剂性能的影响包括在PDH反应中实现高丙烯产率、高丙烯选择性和可持续的失活率。通过优化催化剂组成和反应参数，可以达到这些理想的成果。

3. 锌作为一种丰富的非毒性金属，在PDH过程中作为Pt催化剂的改良剂具有潜力。然而，与后过渡金属如镓和锡相比，其使用受到较少的关注。

4. 根据Weckhuysen及其同事的研究，Pt-Sn催化剂的失活主要与PDH反应过程中纳米级Pt物种的迁移有关，而不是焦炭形成。

5. 通过解释催化剂组成和反应条件的独特性质，可以充分理解Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂在PDH反应中的表现。

6. 尽管催化剂失效，但催化剂的BEA拓扑结构在PDH反应后仍保持完整，表明结构降解不是导致失效的主要原因。

7. 观察到的Pt物种聚集表明Pt和Zn物种之间存在空间分离，导致Pt-Zn相互作用减弱。

8. 提出在高温PDH反应中，Zn物种的丢失是导致Pt-Zn相互作用减弱、Pt物种聚集并在催化剂中导致失效的因素。
