[1] "In order to evaluate the chemical environment of Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite, UVvis analysis was performed with selected samples and the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 1 (c)."
[2] "For 1Zn/Si-Beta and 2Zn/Si-Beta, only the ligand-to-metal charge transfer from O2 to Zn2+ in Si-O-Zn structure (sharp band at  205 nm) could be observed, and the broad band at  370 nm appears with Zn loading increase to 3%, i.e. 3Zn/Si-Beta."
[3] "The introduction of Pt species via impregnation does not change the dispersion of Zn species on Si-Beta support."
[4] "Generally, 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta appears as small aggregates of below 100 nm. In the HR-TEM image, homogeneously dispersed dark dots of 1  2.5 nm could be observed."
[5] "The morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on Si-Beta support were directly investigated by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2 ."
[6] "Briefly, Zn species are stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination and then act as the anchoring sites for Pt species."
[7] "Very high propylene production rate of 4.11 , with high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1, can be achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[8] "On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

1. UVvis analysis was conducted to assess the chemical environment of Zn species on Si-Beta zeolite. 
2. The UVvis spectra showed a sharp band at 205 nm indicative of Zn2+ in a Si-O-Zn structure, and a broad band at 370 nm appeared with increased Zn loading.
3. Impregnation of Pt species did not alter the dispersion of Zn species on the Si-Beta support.
4. 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta had small aggregates of less than 100 nm, with homogeneously dispersed dark dots of approximately 1-2.5 nm visible in the HR-TEM image.
5. Electron microscopy provided direct investigation of the morphology of the zeolite support and the dispersion of Pt and Zn species on the Si-Beta support.
6. Zn species were stabilized by silanols from the zeolite framework dealumination, serving as anchoring sites for Pt species.
7. A high propylene production rate of 4.11 along with 98% propylene selectivity and a sustainable deactivation rate of 0.02 h−1 were achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K.
8. During high-temperature PDH reactions, the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species were observed, leading to irreversible deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst.

1. 使用UVvis分析评估了Zn物种在Si-Beta沸石上的化学环境。
2. UVvis光谱显示了205nm处的尖锐峰，指示Si-O-Zn结构中的Zn2+，随着Zn负载增加，出现了370nm处的宽峰。
3. 通过浸渍引入的Pt物种没有改变Zn物种在Si-Beta支持上的分散性。
4. 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta表现为小于100nm的小聚集体，在HR-TEM图像中可以看到约1-2.5nm的均匀分散的暗点。
5. 电子显微镜直接研究了沸石支持的形态以及Si-Beta支持上Pt和Zn物种的分散性。
6. Zn物种通过沸石框架脱铝后形成的硅醇基稳定，作为Pt物种的锚定位点。
7. 在823K下使用0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta实现了4.11的高丙烯生成速率、98%的丙烯选择性和可持续的失活速率0.02 h−1。
8. 在高温PDH反应过程中，观察到Zn物种的丢失和随后的Pt物种聚集，导致Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂的不可逆失活。
