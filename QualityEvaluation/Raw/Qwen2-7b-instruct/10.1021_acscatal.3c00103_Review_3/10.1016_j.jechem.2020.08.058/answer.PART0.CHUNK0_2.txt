[1] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been fully optimized. Very high propylene production rate of 4.11 , with high propylene selectivity of 98% and a sustainable deactivation rate of  0.02 h1, can be achieved with 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta at 823 K."
[2] "Coke deposition on 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta is found to be very low during PDH reaction, and therefore, is not the key reason for the catalytic deactivation."
[3] "On the other hand, the loss of Zn species and the resulting aggregation of Pt species are clearly observed during high-temperature PDH reaction, which are proposed to be responsible for the irreversible deactivation of Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by stabilizing them through interactions with the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination. This ensures the anchoring of metal species, leading to enhanced metal-support interactions. The implications for improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant. By dispersing metals on zeolite supports with close contact and electronic interactions, catalysts like 0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta can achieve high propylene production rates, high propylene selectivities, and sustainable deactivation rates. The method allows for the optimization of catalyst compositions and reaction parameters to achieve desirable performance metrics, making it a promising approach for enhancing catalyst efficiency in industrial processes. The low coke deposition during the reaction indicates that it is not the primary cause of catalytic deactivation. Instead, the loss of Zn species and the consequent aggregation of Pt species are identified as factors responsible for the irreversible deactivation of the Pt-Zn/Si-Beta catalyst.

该羟基锚定方法通过将活性金属化合物稳定在介孔材料中，利用介晶骨架去铝化产生的羟基进行锚定，从而促进它们与金属物种之间的相互作用。这种方法有助于提高固体-气体反应中催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过在介晶支持上分散金属并保证其接近和电子交互，可以实现如0.1Pt-2Zn/Si-Beta这样的催化剂具有高丙烯产率、高丙烯选择性和可持续的失活速率。通过优化催化剂组成和反应参数，可以达到理想的性能指标，这为提高工业过程中催化剂的效率提供了一个有前景的方法。反应期间低焦炭沉积表明，它不是催化失活的主要原因。相反，锌物种的损失以及随后铂物种的聚集被确认为导致Pt-Zn/Si-Beta催化剂不可逆失活的因素。
