          The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a systematic way to integrate these metals into the crystal framework. This approach enables the formation of strong interactions between the metal species and the support matrix, which in turn enhances the metal-support interactions. These enhanced interactions contribute to the improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions, including propane dehydrogenation, leading to more efficient chemical processes.
