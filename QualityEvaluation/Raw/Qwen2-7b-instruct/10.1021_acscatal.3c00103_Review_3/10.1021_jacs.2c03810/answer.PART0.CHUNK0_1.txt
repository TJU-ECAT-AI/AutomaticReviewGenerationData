The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by enabling precise control over their placement within the structure. This leads to the formation of strong metal-support interactions, which are essential for enhancing the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. As a result, this method has enabled improvements in catalyst performance.
