[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials through a series of steps."
[2] "This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating specific anchoring sites on the surface of the support material."
[3] "As a result, it improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method enhances the incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by creating specific anchoring sites on the surface of the support material. This facilitates better metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
