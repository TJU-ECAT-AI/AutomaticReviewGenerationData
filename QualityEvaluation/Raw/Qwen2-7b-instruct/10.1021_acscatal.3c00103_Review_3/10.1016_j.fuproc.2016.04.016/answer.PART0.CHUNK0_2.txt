[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method involves the use of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support material to covalently bond the active metal compounds. This method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds into crystal materials, allowing for the precise tuning of metal-support interactions."

[2] "By utilizing hydroxyl anchoring, the interactions between the metal species and the support can be optimized, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. This is because the hydroxyl groups provide a specific binding site for the metal, enabling more effective utilization of the metal active sites."

[3] "Furthermore, the hydroxyl anchoring method ensures that the metal compounds are evenly distributed throughout the crystal lattice, which is crucial for maintaining high activity and selectivity in solid-gas reactions. It also prevents the leaching of metal species, thus improving the overall stability of the catalyst."

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise incorporation of active metal compounds into crystal materials through covalent bonding with hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support material. This facilitates optimized metal-support interactions, leading to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By ensuring uniform distribution of metal compounds within the crystal lattice and preventing leaching, this method maintains high activity and stability, contributing significantly to improved catalytic performance.
