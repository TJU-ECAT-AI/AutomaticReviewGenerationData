The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise embedding of active metal compounds into the crystalline structure of the support material, allowing for the targeted placement of metal sites within the crystal lattice. This method facilitates the formation of strong, covalent bonds between the metal and the support, which significantly enhances the stability of the catalyst under operating conditions. By fine-tuning the hydroxyl anchoring, researchers can optimize the catalyst's characteristics, resulting in enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability. The potential impact of this technique is substantial, as it offers a promising pathway for the development of highly effective and long-lasting heterogeneous catalysts for diverse solid-gas reactions.
