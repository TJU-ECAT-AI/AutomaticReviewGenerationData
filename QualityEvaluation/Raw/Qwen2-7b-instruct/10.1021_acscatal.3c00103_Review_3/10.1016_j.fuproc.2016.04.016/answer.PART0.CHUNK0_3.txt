The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise integration of active metal components within crystal structures by leveraging the hydroxyl groups of the supporting material to bind with metal ions. This technique significantly enhances the interactions between the metal and the support, leading to improved performance of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By promoting a more even and stable distribution of metal sites on the surface of the support, the method ensures optimal utilization of active sites, mitigates metal aggregation or loss, and consequently boosts catalyst activity, selectivity, and longevity.
