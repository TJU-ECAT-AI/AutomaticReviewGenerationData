<p>The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal compounds within crystal materials by utilizing the strong interaction between hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface and metal ions. This interaction facilitates the controlled deposition and incorporation of metal compounds, leading to enhanced metal-support interactions. The method improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions by ensuring uniform distribution of metal active sites on the support, minimizing agglomeration, and optimizing the metal-support interface.</p>
