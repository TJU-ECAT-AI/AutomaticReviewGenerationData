<p>The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a strong interaction between the metal and the support through hydroxyl groups. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.</p>

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components into crystalline materials by leveraging hydroxyl groups to strengthen the bond between the metal and the support. This enhancement of metal-support interactions results in heightened activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
