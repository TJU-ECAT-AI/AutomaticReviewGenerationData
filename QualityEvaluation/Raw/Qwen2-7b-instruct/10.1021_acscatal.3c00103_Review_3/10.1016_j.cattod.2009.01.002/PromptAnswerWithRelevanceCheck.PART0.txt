• "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups present on the crystal surface to anchor the metal compounds. This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating a strong physical or chemical bonding between the metal and the support material, thereby improving the stability of the catalyst. The implications for enhancing activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions are significant, as it ensures a more uniform distribution of metal active sites across the support, leading to better catalytic performance."

[1] "To this end, DHP over Pt-SBA-15 and Pt-Sn-SBA-15, prepared by incipient wetness impregnation (IW), was studied at 793 K by means of tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with on-line gas-chromatography."
[2] "The catalysts activity, selectivity, coking and stability were simultaneously studied by tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) which is coupled to an on-line GC."
[3] "The amount of coke deposits after 220 min on stream was measured to be almost three times higher on Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than that on Pt-SBA-15-IW."
[4] "Despite this, propane conversion (16%) and selectivity to propylene (99%) are virtually unchanged over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW."
[5] "It is evident from TEOM studies that after 220 min on stream the amount of coke formed is almost three times higher over Pt-Sn-SBA-15-IW than on its counterpart Pt-SBA-15-IW."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise placement of metals within the crystal lattice. This method enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. Specifically, the method enables the formation of smaller Pt particles in Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalysts compared to Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, due to the higher dispersion of Pt caused by the formation of PtSn alloy particles. The nature and activity properties of surface Pt sites in the catalysts are influenced by differences in surface roughness (surface site heterogeneity) and modifications of electronic properties of the sites by Sn in bimetallic Pt-Sn alloy particles. As a result, Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalysts exhibit higher propane conversion and higher amount of coke formation compared to Pt-SBA-15 catalysts, attributed to higher surface roughness of the former. However, the Pt-Sn-SBA-15 catalyst shows superior selectivity to propylene and stability, thanks to the weaker adsorption affinity of hydrocarbons on the surface Pt sites, which creates a draining-off effect that keeps active sites clean from coking.

该水合锚定方法通过允许金属精确放置在晶格内，从而促进了活性金属化合物在晶体材料中的可控集成。这种方法增强了金属支持之间的相互作用，进而提高了在固相气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。具体而言，该方法使铂-Sn-SBA-15催化剂中的铂颗粒形成得比铂-SBA-15催化剂更小，这是由于铂在铂-Sn合金粒子中的更高分散导致的。催化剂表面铂位的性质和活动性由颗粒表面粗糙度（表面位点异质性）差异以及在双金属铂-Sn合金颗粒中铂位的电子性质的修改所影响。因此，铂-Sn-SBA-15催化剂与铂-SBA-15催化剂相比，表现出更高的丙烷转化率和更高的焦炭形成量，归因于前者的较高表面粗糙度。然而，铂-Sn-SBA-15催化剂显示出更高的丙烯选择性和稳定性，这得益于对表面铂位吸附亲和力较弱的烃类分子，从而形成了清除活性位点上的焦化作用的排水效应，保持活性位点清洁无焦化。
