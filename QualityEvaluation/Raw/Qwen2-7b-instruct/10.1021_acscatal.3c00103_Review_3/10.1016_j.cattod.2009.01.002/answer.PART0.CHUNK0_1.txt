• "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups present on the crystal surface to anchor the metal compounds. This method enhances metal-support interactions by creating a strong physical or chemical bonding between the metal and the support material, thereby improving the stability of the catalyst. The implications for enhancing activity, selectivity, and stability in solid-gas reactions are significant, as it ensures a more uniform distribution of metal active sites across the support, leading to better catalytic performance."
