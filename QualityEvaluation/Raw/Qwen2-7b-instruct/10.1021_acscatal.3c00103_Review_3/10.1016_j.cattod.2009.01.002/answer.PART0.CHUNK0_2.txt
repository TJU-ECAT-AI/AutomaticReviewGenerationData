[1] "The objective of this work was to gain a better understanding of the influence of Sn on the dispersion of Pt in platinum supported SBA-15 catalysts and thereby on the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP) activity, selectivity to propylene, coking and catalyst stability."
[2] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a stable interface between the metal and the support, which enhances metal-support interactions. This method improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
