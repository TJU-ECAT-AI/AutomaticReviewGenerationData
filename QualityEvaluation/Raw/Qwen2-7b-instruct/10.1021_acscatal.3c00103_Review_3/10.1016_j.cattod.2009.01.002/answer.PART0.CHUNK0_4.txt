<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components within crystal structures. This technique strengthens the bonds between metals and supports, thereby boosting the catalyst's performance in solid-gas reactions. The enhanced interactions lead to improved activity, selectivity, and durability of the heterogeneous catalyst.
