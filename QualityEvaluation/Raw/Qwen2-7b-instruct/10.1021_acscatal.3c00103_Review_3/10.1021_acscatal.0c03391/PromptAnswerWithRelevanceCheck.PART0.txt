Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a specific binding site on the support surface. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
羟基锚定方法通过在支撑表面提供特定的结合点，促进活性金属化合物在晶材料中的可控掺入。这增强了金属-支撑相互作用，从而提高了异质催化剂在固体-气体反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。

<quotes>
[1] "Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) overcoating improves catalyst selectivity and longevity in propane dehydrogenation."
[2] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials."
[3] "Its implications for enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are significant."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise addition of active metal components into crystal structures, thereby strengthening the interactions between metals and supports. This leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
羟基锚定方法能够精确地将活性金属成分添加到晶体结构中，从而增强金属与支撑物之间的相互作用。这导致了在固-气反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性的提高。
