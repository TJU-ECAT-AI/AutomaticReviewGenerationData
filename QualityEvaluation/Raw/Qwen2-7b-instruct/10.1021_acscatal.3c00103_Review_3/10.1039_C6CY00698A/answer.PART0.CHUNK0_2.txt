[1] "In order to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts, we have synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic Ga species and compared their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions."
[2] "The conventional gallium-based alkane aromatization catalyst is prepared by impregnation of an acidic zeolite with an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate, followed by calcination in air."
[3] "The catalytic activity of GaSiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 2. At 500 C, nearly steady rates of propylene production are achieved within the first 30 minutes on stream, and maintained for at least 6 h."
[4] "Importantly, ΔXANES spectra from both catalysts demonstrate that shifts to lower edge energy under reducing conditions arise from sequential formation of (at least) two separate species."

The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for precise integration of active metal compounds within crystal structures by exploiting the strong interactions between metal ions and hydroxyl groups. This method enhances metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. For instance, the synthesis of molecular model compounds and grafting of organometallic gallium species to supports like silica and zeolites were employed to investigate the XANES spectra under reducing conditions. The results showed that gallium-based catalysts might contain three-coordinate gallium hydride species rather than gallium ions, suggesting that CH bond activation might proceed via non-redox mechanisms involving gallium hydrides. The catalytic performance of gallium-silica catalysts for olefin hydrogenation indicates that gallium ions can remain stable under mild conditions, supporting the idea that they do not undergo reduction to gallium ions during alkane dehydrogenation.

氢氧基锚定方法通过利用金属离子与氢氧基之间的强相互作用，允许精确地在晶体结构中集成活性金属化合物。这种方法增强了金属支持之间的相互作用，从而提高了在固体-气体反应中的异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。例如，合成了一系列分子模型化合物，并将有机金属镓物种嫁接到如硅和沸石等支撑材料上，以研究在还原条件下获得的XANES光谱。结果表明，镓基催化剂可能含有三价镓氢化物物种而不是镓离子，暗示CH键激活可能通过涉及镓氢化物的非氧化还原机制进行。镓-硅催化剂用于烯烃氢化的过程表明，镓离子可以在温和条件下保持稳定，这支持了它们在烷烃脱氢过程中不被还原到镓离子的观点。
