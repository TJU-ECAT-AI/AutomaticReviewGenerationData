<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise insertion of active metal components into crystalline materials, thereby strengthening the connections between metals and supports. This enhancement leads to increased activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
