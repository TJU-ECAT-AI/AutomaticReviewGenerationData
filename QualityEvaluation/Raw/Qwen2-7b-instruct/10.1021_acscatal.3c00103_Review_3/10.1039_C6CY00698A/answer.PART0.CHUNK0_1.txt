[1] "In order to better understand what species might give rise to the observed XANES spectra, a series of molecular Ga(iii) model compounds with different ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra examined."
[2] "These findings apply both to gallium-impregnated zeolite catalysts and to silica-supported single site gallium catalysts, the latter of which is found to be active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane and hydrogenation of propylene."
[3] "The importance of ligand effects on XANES edge energy is most dramatically illustrated by comparing (4) and Ga(acac)3, which have edge energies differing by more than 6 eV despite both containing gallium in the +3 oxidation state."
[4] "Comparison of the XANES spectra of GaSiO2 and GaH-BEA catalysts exposed to hydrogen at high temperature with XANES spectra of molecular reference compounds suggest that these catalysts may contain three-coordinate Ga3+ dihydride species rather than Ga+."

1.A series of molecular gallium(iii) model compounds with various ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra were examined to understand the species behind the observed XANES spectra.
2.Gallium-modified zeolites and silica-supported single-site gallium catalysts both showed activity in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation.
3.The edge energy difference between gallium(iii) compounds (4) and Ga(acac)3, despite both having gallium in the +3 oxidation state, illustrates the significant impact of ligand effects on XANES edge energy.
4.Comparing the XANES spectra of GaSiO2 and GaH-BEA catalysts treated with hydrogen at high temperatures with those of molecular reference compounds indicates that these catalysts may contain three-coordinate gallium(III) dihydride species instead of gallium(+).

1.一系列具有不同配体的分子镓(iii)模型化合物被合成并进行了XANES光谱分析，以理解观察到的XANES光谱背后的具体物种。
2.含镓的沸石改性材料和二氧化硅支持的单原子镓催化剂均表现出丙烷脱氢和丙烯氢化的能力。
3.尽管(4)和Ga(acac)3中都含有+3价的镓，但它们之间的XANES边能差异超过6电子伏特，这强调了配体效应对XANES边能的影响。
4.将GaSiO2和GaH-BEA催化剂在高温下处理后与分子参考化合物的XANES光谱进行比较表明，这些催化剂可能含有三配位的镓(III)二氢化合物，而非镓(+)。
