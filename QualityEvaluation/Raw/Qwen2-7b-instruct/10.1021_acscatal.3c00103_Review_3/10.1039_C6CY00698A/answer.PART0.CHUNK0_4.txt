[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by allowing precise positioning of the metal species within the crystal lattice."
[2] "This method enables enhanced metal-support interactions, thereby improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."
