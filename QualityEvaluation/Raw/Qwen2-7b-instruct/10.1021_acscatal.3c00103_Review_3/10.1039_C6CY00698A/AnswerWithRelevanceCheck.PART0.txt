          [1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystalline materials."
          [2] "This facilitates strong metal-support interactions."
          [3] "By enhancing these interactions, the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts are improved."

      <English>
          The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise insertion of active metal components into crystalline materials, thereby strengthening the connections between metals and supports. This enhancement leads to increased activity, selectivity, and durability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

          [1] "A series of molecular Ga(iii) model compounds with different ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra examined."
          [2] "These findings apply both to gallium-impregnated zeolite catalysts and to silica-supported single site gallium catalysts, the latter of which is found to be active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane and hydrogenation of propylene."
          [3] "The importance of ligand effects on XANES edge energy is most dramatically illustrated by comparing (4) and Ga(acac)3, which have edge energies differing by more than 6 eV despite both containing gallium in the +3 oxidation state."
          [4] "Comparison of the XANES spectra of GaSiO2 and GaH-BEA catalysts exposed to hydrogen at high temperature with XANES spectra of molecular reference compounds suggest that these catalysts may contain three-coordinate Ga3+ dihydride species rather than Ga+."

      <English>
          A series of molecular gallium(iii) model compounds with varying ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra analyzed to understand the species responsible for the observed XANES spectra. These findings pertain to gallium-modified zeolite catalysts and silica-supported single-site gallium catalysts, demonstrating activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. The significance of ligand effects on XANES edge energy was demonstrated by contrasting the properties of gallium(iii) compounds (4) and Ga(acac)3, which exhibit a substantial difference in edge energy despite both being in the +3 oxidation state. Comparative analysis of the XANES spectra of GaSiO2 and GaH-BEA catalysts treated with hydrogen at high temperature against molecular reference compounds suggests that these catalysts might consist of three-coordinate Ga3+ dihydride species rather than Ga+.

          一系列具有不同配体的分子镓(iii)模型化合物被合成并进行了XANES光谱分析，以理解观察到的XANES光谱背后的物种。这些发现适用于含镓改性的沸石催化剂和二氧化硅支持的单原子镓催化剂，显示了在丙烷脱氢和丙烯氢化过程中的活性和选择性。配体效应对XANES边能的影响的重要性通过对比化合物(4)和Ga(acac)3的性质得到证明，两者均为+3价的镓，但边能差异超过6电子伏特。将GaSiO2和GaH-BEA催化剂在高温下处理后与分子参考化合物的XANES光谱进行比较，表明这些催化剂可能含有三配位的镓(III)二氢化合物，而非镓(+)。

      <English>
          A series of molecular model compounds were synthesized, and surface organometallic gallium species were grafted. Their XANES spectra were compared to those of gallium-based catalysts under reducing conditions. A conventional gallium-based alkane aromatization catalyst was prepared by impregnating an acidic zeolite with an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate and then calcined in air. The catalytic activity of GaSiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was shown at 500°C, with nearly constant propylene production rates within the first 30 minutes and maintained for at least 6 hours. It was also demonstrated that reductions in edge energy under reducing conditions arise from the sequential formation of at least two distinct species.
