[1] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[2] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[3] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[4] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

The petrochemical industry is facing challenges due to high energy demands, low selectivity for olefin production, diminishing oil reserves, and rising oil prices. These factors are driving the industry to seek more cost-effective feedstocks and more efficient conversion methods. Propane dehydrogenation is profitable because of the significant price difference between propane and propylene, indicating favorable market conditions. Shale gas deposits contain substantial amounts of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including ethane and propane, which are easily separated from natural gas. This has led to investments in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) facilities in the US, China, and Japan. The number of new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) installations is anticipated to grow significantly in the coming years, with dozens of new installations announced worldwide, many already under construction. The products derived from olefins are shown in the graph to the right. In 2007, only about 3% of propylene was produced using direct methods, while the majority was produced through FCC and steam cracking processes. The US obtains about a quarter of its natural gas production from shale gas deposits, a trend expected to increase due to efforts towards energy independence. The abundance of relatively inexpensive ethane from shale gas has facilitated a shift from naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane-based steam cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of NGLs, including ethane and propane, which are easily separable from natural gas.

[1] "In situ FTIR spectroscopy has provided evidence of the formation of acetaldehyde and acetone intermediates as ethane and propane are adsorbed on a mesoporous chromia-alumina catalyst."
[2] "This is consistent with a model in which the first step of the reaction is the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkane to form an alkoxide species (ethoxide and isopropoxide being formed from ethane and propane, respectively)."
[3] "However, the reduction of the catalyst prior to the dehydrogenation reaction led to a dramatic decrease in the amounts of acetates and carboxylates detected, albeit the reaction rate remained unaffected."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by providing a strong anchoring site for the metal compounds, thereby enhancing metal-support interactions. This method leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. Specifically, it allows for the formation of strong metal-support interactions, which are crucial for the efficient catalytic activity. The enhanced interactions ensure that the active metal species remain anchored to the support surface, preventing their dispersion and thus maintaining their catalytic effectiveness over multiple reaction cycles. The method also enables the precise control of metal loading, which can optimize the catalytic performance by balancing the availability of active sites with the support's structural integrity. Furthermore, the hydroxyl anchoring method can tailor the electronic properties of the catalyst surface, affecting the reactivity of the metal species and potentially leading to enhanced selectivity towards desired products in solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by serving as a strong anchoring site for metal precursors during the synthesis of crystal materials. This enhances metal-support interactions by providing a stable and precise location for the metal to be anchored onto the crystal support. As a result, the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are improved. The hydroxyl group's polar nature allows for strong electrostatic interactions with the metal ions, guiding their precise deposition and orientation on the crystal surface. This precise anchoring minimizes the risk of metal clustering or dispersion, which can degrade catalyst performance. Moreover, the hydroxyl anchoring method enables the creation of catalysts with tailored properties, as the type of crystal material, its surface area, and the metal-loading can be precisely controlled during synthesis. This leads to catalysts with optimized performance for specific reaction conditions and product yields.

In summary, the hydroxyl anchoring method improves catalyst performance by ensuring strong, stable, and controlled metal-support interactions, which are critical for maintaining high activity and selectivity over prolonged periods of operation. The precise anchoring of metal compounds also helps in minimizing side reactions and maximizing the yield of desired products in solid-gas reactions.

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by leveraging the inherent properties of hydroxyl groups. These groups act as anchors, enabling precise attachment of metal compounds to the crystal lattice. This approach enhances metal-support interactions by providing a stable bonding site, which in turn improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The hydroxyl anchoring allows for the creation of active sites that are finely tuned for catalytic processes, optimizing the reaction pathways and enhancing efficiency.

The method works by utilizing hydroxyl groups derived from the crystal material itself, or added during the synthesis process. These hydroxyl groups can interact with metal ions or complexes, leading to their incorporation into the crystal structure. The precise location and orientation of these metal sites can be controlled, leading to enhanced catalytic performance tailored to specific reactions.

For instance, replacing Al3+ ions in zeolite frameworks with Fe3+ ions facilitates the anchoring of Pt precursors in zeolite channels, resulting in the formation of subnanometric Pt clusters. This not only stabilizes the active sites but also influences their electronic properties, thereby affecting the catalytic behavior.

The introduction of tin (Sn) as a promoter also impacts the catalytic properties of platinum (Pt) through both geometric and electronic effects. Geometrically, Sn can selectively cover low coordination Pt sites, reducing the size of Pt ensembles and curbing structure-sensitive reactions like hydrogenolysis and coking. Electronically, Sn can transfer electrons to the 5d band of Pt atoms, altering their adsorptive and catalytic properties.

The incorporation of Sn into the PtSn alloy is facilitated by its interaction with the hydroxyl groups present on the support. Partial reduction of SnO2 species on the support leads to the formation of a PtSn alloy, which can further modify the electronic properties of Pt. This process is reversible upon oxidation, indicating dynamic interactions between Sn and the Pt-support interface.

In summary, the hydroxyl anchoring method enables the strategic incorporation of active metal compounds into crystal materials, enhancing their catalytic capabilities through improved metal-support interactions, optimized electronic properties, and controlled reaction site characteristics.

该羟基锚定方法通过利用晶体材料固有的羟基特性，实现了活性金属化合物在晶态材料中的可控整合。这些羟基作为锚点，允许精确地将金属化合物附着到晶格中，从而增强金属-载体之间的相互作用。这种方法通过提供一个稳定的结合点来优化异质催化剂在固-气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。

该方法通过利用晶体材料本身或合成过程中添加的羟基组合作为锚点，实现对金属离子或复合物的整合，进而形成晶格结构。这种整合能够精确控制活性位点的位置和取向，优化催化过程并提高效率。

例如，在沸石框架中用Fe3+离子替换Al3+离子，有助于Pt前体在沸石通道内的锚定，从而形成亚纳米级的Pt簇。这不仅稳定了活性位点，而且影响其电子性质，从而改变催化行为。

引入锡（Sn）作为促进剂也通过几何和电子效应影响铂（Pt）的催化性质。几何上，Sn可以选择性地覆盖低协调的Pt位点，减小Pt簇的大小，并抑制结构敏感反应如氢解离和焦炭形成。电子上，Sn可以将电子传递给Pt原子的5d轨道，改变它们的吸附性和催化性质。

Sn的整合进入PtSn合金是通过与支持上的羟基组分的交互实现的。SnO2物种在支持上的部分还原导致形成PtSn合金，进一步修改了Pt的电子性质。这一过程在氧化后可逆，表明Sn与Pt-支持界面接口之间动态的相互作用。

总之，羟基锚定方法使活性金属化合物能够在晶态材料中进行战略整合，通过改善金属-载体相互作用、优化电子性质以及控制反应位点特性，增强了其催化能力。
