[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method involves the introduction of hydroxyl groups onto the surface of the support material. These hydroxyl groups act as anchor points for the attachment of metal compounds."
[2] "This method enhances the interaction between the metal and the support by providing specific binding sites, which can improve the dispersion and stability of the metal catalyst."
[3] "By controlling the number and location of hydroxyl groups, the method allows for the precise incorporation of metal compounds, leading to catalysts with improved activity and selectivity."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by serving as anchor points for the attachment of these metals. This method enhances metal-support interactions, improves dispersion and stability of the metal catalyst, and allows for precise incorporation through control of hydroxyl group number and location, resulting in catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.
