[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the hydroxyl groups present on the support surface. These hydroxyl groups serve as anchoring sites for metal precursors during the synthesis process."
[2] "By enhancing metal-support interactions, this method can improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method enables the precise integration of active metal components into crystal structures by leveraging the hydroxyl groups on the support surface. These hydroxyl groups act as attachment points for metal precursors during synthesis, thereby strengthening metal-support interactions. This enhancement leads to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
