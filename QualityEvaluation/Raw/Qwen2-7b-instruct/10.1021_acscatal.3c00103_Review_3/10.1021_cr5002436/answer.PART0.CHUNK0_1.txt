[1] "In the hydroxyl anchoring method, active metal compounds are incorporated into crystal materials by coordinating with hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support. This facilitates the controlled and precise incorporation of metal compounds, leading to improved metal-support interactions."
[2] "The enhanced metal-support interactions achieved through hydroxyl anchoring can significantly improve the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions."

The hydroxyl anchoring method allows for the precise incorporation of active metal compounds into crystal materials by utilizing hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support. This leads to enhanced metal-support interactions, which in turn significantly improves the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
