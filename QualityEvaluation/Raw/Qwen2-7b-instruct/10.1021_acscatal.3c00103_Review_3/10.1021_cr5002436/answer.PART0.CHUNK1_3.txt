[1] "The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by utilizing the strong interaction between hydroxyl groups on the crystal surface and metal ions. This interaction ensures that the metal ions are precisely anchored at specific locations on the crystal lattice, thereby enhancing the metal-support interactions."
[2] "By improving the metal-support interactions, the hydroxyl anchoring method leads to an enhancement in the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. This is because the precise anchoring of metal ions ensures a more uniform distribution of active sites, reduces sintering, and minimizes the risk of metal leaching, which collectively contribute to improved catalytic performance."
