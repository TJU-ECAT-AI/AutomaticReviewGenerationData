[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
[2] "Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation."
[3] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
[4] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[5] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
[6] "When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."
[7] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[8] "However, the reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[9] "Initially, deactivation is caused by the strong adsorption of reactants on the active sites and to a lesser extent to coke deposition."
[10] "In several studies, CO2 is added to the feed as a mild oxidant to increase alkene yields."
[11] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[12] "Furthermore, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide."
[13] "Overall, MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity."
[14] "To improve the stability of the oxide, steam can be added to the feed (which hampers the growth of these carbides) or the catalyst can be doped with vanadium (which increases the oxophilicity of the catalyst)."
[15] "This was explained by the increased reducibility of MoO3/SiC as compared to the MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst."
[16] "A summary of the Mo-based catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins is shown in Table 6."
[17] "In Table 6 are shown the catalytic activity data of the indium- and iron-based dehydrogenation catalysts discussed."
[18] "To summarize, although metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, the latter can operate at higher space velocities and exhibit lower deactivation rates than metal oxide catalysts."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by serving as a strong anchoring site for metal precursors during the synthesis of crystal materials. This enhances metal-support interactions by providing a stable and precise location for the metal to be anchored onto the crystal support. As a result, the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions are improved. The hydroxyl group's polar nature allows for strong electrostatic interactions with the metal ions, guiding their precise deposition and orientation on the crystal surface. This precise anchoring minimizes the risk of metal clustering or dispersion, which can degrade catalyst performance. Moreover, the hydroxyl anchoring method enables the creation of catalysts with tailored properties, as the type of crystal material, its surface area, and the metal-loading can be precisely controlled during synthesis. This leads to catalysts with optimized performance for specific reaction conditions and product yields.

In summary, the hydroxyl anchoring method improves catalyst performance by ensuring strong, stable, and controlled metal-support interactions, which are critical for maintaining high activity and selectivity over prolonged periods of operation. The precise anchoring of metal compounds also helps in minimizing side reactions and maximizing the yield of desired products in solid-gas reactions.
