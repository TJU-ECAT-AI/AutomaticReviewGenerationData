[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."
[2] "Vanadium oxides are known to be active for many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation."
[3] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
[4] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[5] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
[6] "When these basic sites are too strong, as is the case on Al2O3 and ZnO2, CO2 irreversibly adsorbs and poisons these sites."
[7] "According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."
[8] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[9] "Overall, MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity."
[10] "The formation of molybdenum oxycarbides (MoOxCy) has been reported to occur during butane dehydrogenation on unsupported molybdenum oxide."
[11] "The exact nature of the active sites in Ga-based dehydrogenation catalysts is still under debate."
[12] "Indeed, a heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism has been proposed where H adsorbs on a Ga+ Lewis acid site and C3H7+ on a neighboring oxygen, although these species can also be adsorbed reversed."
[13] "This barrier is much lower over a gallium hydridehydroxide species, although the formation of the gallium hydride also involves a high energy barrier."
[14] "For instance, on a PtGa/H-beta catalyst, reduced gallium hydrides were observed after hydrogen reduction at 550 C."
[15] "It is important to note that Ga2O is gaseous and metallic gallium is liquid at dehydrogenation reaction conditions."
[16] "Additionally, Michorczyk et al. noted that this effect could only be seen at relative low levels of coke deposition."
[17] "The authors attributed this promoting effect to the formation of partially hydrolyzed gallium species, more specifically, to the formation of binuclear hydroxyl-bridged Ga3+ cations."
[18] "The authors proposed the activity to be dependent on the presence of acid sites of medium strength on the catalyst surface."
[19] "However, which metal, Pt or Ga, is predominately responsible for the high activity of this catalyst, is not discussed."
[20] "It was suggested that the role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species."
