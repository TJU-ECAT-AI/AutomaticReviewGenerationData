[1] "To achieve high activity, the operating conditions also need to be considered, because activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane."
[2] "As is shown in Figure 16 with XANES and in Figure 15 with UVvis spectroscopy, it was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction and that polychromate is more easily reduced than monochromate."
[3] "Indeed, it has been observed that isolated Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies are formed on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of an alkane. Thus, it appears that these catalysts contain coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ under reaction conditions."
[4] "In conclusion, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."

The operating conditions significantly influence the activity of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. Specifically, activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane. During the initial stages of the reaction, surface Cr3+ species are formed at the expense of Cr6+ species, indicating a reduction process. The presence of an alkane leads to the formation of isolated Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, suggesting that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species are active under reaction conditions. To optimize activity and selectivity, one can adjust the catalyst composition and operating conditions, as confirmed by the conclusion that high activity and selectivity can be achieved by modifying these parameters.

在烷烃脱氢催化剂中，操作条件对活性有重大影响。具体来说，活性与反应温度和烷烃分压成正比。在反应初期，表面Cr3+物种在Cr6+物种的消耗下形成，表明一个还原过程。存在烷烃导致CrOx/Al2O3催化剂上形成孤立的Cr3+物种，具有两个配位空位，表明反应条件下存在配位不饱和的Cr3+物种。为了优化活性和选择性，可以通过调整催化剂组成和操作条件来实现高活性和选择性的结论已经证实，可以通过修改这些参数来优化活性和选择性。
