The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by trapping and stabilizing metal cations within the Si-OH groups of the zeolite structure. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method allows for the creation of highly dispersed metal species that are effectively anchored within the zeolite framework, resulting in enhanced catalytic performance. The two-step activation of propane on zinc sites, indicated by TPSR and co-feeding experiments, suggests that hydrogen abstraction plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses confirm the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, with these partially reduced species being identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction.
