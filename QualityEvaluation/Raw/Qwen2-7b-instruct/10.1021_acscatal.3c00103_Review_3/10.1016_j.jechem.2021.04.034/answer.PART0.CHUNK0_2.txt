[1] "Well-isolated zinc cations are successfully trapped and stabilized by the Si-OH groups in S-1 zeolites via in-situ hydrothermal synthesis."
[2] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 catalysts exhibit good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in PDH reaction under employed conditions."
[3] "Zeolites are commonly used as support materials and their well-ordered porous structure enables the efficient stabilization as well as the good distribution of zinc species."
[4] "The in-situ partial reduction of zinc species is observed and the partially reduced zinc cations are definitely identified as the active sites for PDH reaction."
[5] "The first step of propane activation occurred on Zn2+ sites and the second step of propane (C3H7 motif) activation occurred on the in-situ reduced Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species."

1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by trapping and stabilizing metal cations within the Si-OH groups of zeolites through in-situ hydrothermal synthesis. This enhances metal-support interactions, potentially leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.
