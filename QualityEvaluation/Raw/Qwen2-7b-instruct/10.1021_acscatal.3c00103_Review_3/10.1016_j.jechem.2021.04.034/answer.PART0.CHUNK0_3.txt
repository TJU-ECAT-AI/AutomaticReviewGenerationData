[1] "A series of Zn-containing zeolites with different zinc loadings, namely Zn@S-1, have been successfully prepared via ligand-protected direct hydrothermal route."
[2] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components."
[3] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been optimized. Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction."
[4] "TPSR and co-feeding experiments indicate the two-step activation of propane on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction."
[5] "In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by trapping and stabilizing the metal ions within the Si-OH groups of the zeolite structure through a direct hydrothermal synthesis. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. By optimizing the catalyst composition and reaction parameters, the Zn@S-1 zeolites demonstrate excellent dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. The partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction is identified as the preferred active site for the reaction, indicating that the two-step activation of propane occurs on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction. These findings highlight the potential of zinc-containing zeolites as effective PDH catalysts due to their unique structural properties and catalytic behavior.

氢氧基锚定方法通过直接水热合成在晶材料中实现活性金属化合物的可控掺杂，通过Si-OH组分的晶质结构捕获和稳定金属离子。这加强了金属支持间的相互作用，从而提升了异相催化剂在固气反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过优化催化剂组成和反应参数，Zn@S-1晶质显示出在丙烷脱氢反应（PDH）中良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性和再生能力。在PDH反应中，锌物种的局部还原为Znδ+（0 < δ < 2）物种被确认为反应的优选活性位点，表明丙烷的两步活化在锌位点上通过氢提取发生。这些发现表明，含锌晶质具有作为有效PDH催化剂的巨大潜力，由于其独特的结构特性和催化行为。
