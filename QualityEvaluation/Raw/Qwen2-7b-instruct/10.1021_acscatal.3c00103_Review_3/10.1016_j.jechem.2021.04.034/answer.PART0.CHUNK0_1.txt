[1] "The as-prepared Zn@S-1 zeolites are applied as potential PDH catalysts with zinc species as the exclusive active components."
[2] "Characterization results from FTIR, NMR, TEM, UVvis and XPS reveal that well-isolated zinc cations are trapped and efficiently stabilized by the Si-OH groups of S-1."
[3] "The catalyst compositions and reaction parameters have been optimized. Zn-4@S-1 catalyst exhibits good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity and regeneration capability in PDH reaction."
[4] "TPSR and co-feeding experiments indicate the two-step activation of propane on zinc sites via hydrogen abstraction."
[5] "In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses evidence the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, and the partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction."

The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by trapping and stabilizing metal cations within the Si-OH groups of the zeolite structure. This enhances metal-support interactions, leading to improved activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions. The method allows for the creation of highly dispersed metal species that are effectively anchored within the zeolite framework, resulting in enhanced catalytic performance. The two-step activation of propane on zinc sites, indicated by TPSR and co-feeding experiments, suggests that hydrogen abstraction plays a crucial role in the catalytic process. In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses confirm the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ (0 < δ < 2) species during PDH reaction, with these partially reduced species being identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction.

氢氧基锚定方法通过将金属离子锁定并稳定在硅醇基团中，从而在晶体材料中实现活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这增强了金属-载体相互作用，提高了固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。该方法允许在沸石结构中创建高度分散的金属物种，并有效锚定在沸石骨架内，从而导致增强的催化性能。TPSR和共喂料实验表明，丙烷在锌位点上的两步活化涉及氢抽象，对催化过程至关重要。原位近大气压X射线光电子能谱（NAP XPS）和离线XPS分析证实，在PDH反应过程中，Zn2+被部分还原为Znδ+（0<δ<2）物种，这些部分还原的Znδ+物种被识别为反应的优选活性位点。
