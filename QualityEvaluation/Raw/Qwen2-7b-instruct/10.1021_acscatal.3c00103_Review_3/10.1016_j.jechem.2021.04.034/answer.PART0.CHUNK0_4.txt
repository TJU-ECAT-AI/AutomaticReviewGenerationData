1. The hydroxyl anchoring method facilitates the controlled incorporation of active metal compounds in crystal materials by trapping and stabilizing them with the Si-OH groups within zeolites, thus enhancing metal-support interactions and improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of heterogeneous catalysts in solid-gas reactions.

2. Partial reduction of zinc species occurs during the propane dehydrogenation reaction, with the partially reduced zinc cations (Znδ+, where 0 < δ < 2) identified as the preferred active sites for the reaction.

3. The optimized Zn@S-1 catalyst demonstrates good dehydrogenation activity, high propylene selectivity, and regeneration capability in propane dehydrogenation reactions. At 853 K, propylene STY of 24 and selectivity of 97% can be achieved, indicating its potential for industrial propane dehydrogenation processes.

4. In-situ NAP XPS and ex-situ XPS analyses confirm the partial reduction of Zn2+ to Znδ+ species during the propane dehydrogenation reaction. These partially reduced Znδ+ species are identified as the active sites responsible for the reaction's catalytic behavior.

1. 在原位水热合成过程中，通过Si-OH基团捕获和稳定活性金属化合物在晶材料中的插入，羟基锚定方法实现了对活性金属化合物的可控掺入。这增强了在固体-气体反应中异质催化剂的金属-支持相互作用，并提高了其活性、选择性和稳定性。

2. 在丙烷脱氢反应过程中，锌物种的部分还原被观察到，部分还原的锌离子（Znδ+，其中0 < δ < 2）被确认为反应的关键活性位点。

3. 优化后的Zn@S-1催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中展现出良好的脱氢活性、高丙烯选择性以及再生能力。在853 K时，可以实现丙烯时空产率（STY）为24和选择性为97%，这表明该催化剂具有工业丙烷脱氢过程的巨大潜力。

4. 在线近常压X射线光电子能谱（NAP XPS）和离线X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析证实了在丙烷脱氢反应过程中Zn2+的部分还原至Znδ+物种。这些部分还原的Znδ+物种被确认为催化行为的关键活性位点。
