[1] "The presence of mesopores reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal that mitigates the hydride transfer."
[2] "Regardless of the initial gallium location, the solid ionic exchange proceeds during reduction treatment, if the gallium content is enough, up to a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic sites;"
[3] "Regardless of the preparation method (MM or IE), the yield in BTX passes through a maximum at 20% with a gallium content of 2.5 wt%, while on all the hierarchical zeolites, the BTX yields are much lower (Fig. 9b)."
[4] "Regardless of the initial gallium location, the solid ionic exchange proceeds during reduction treatment, if the gallium content is enough, up to a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic sites;"
[5] "The cracking activity of n-hexane (a test) is proportional to the concentration of the protonic sites probed by the pyridine on the calcined catalysts and not on the reduced ones; the catalysts recov- ered their intrinsic acidic properties which indicates the instability of the gallium hydride species in presence of hydrocarbons."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane. This activation leads to the formation of a carbenium intermediate. The key steps involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule by a gallium atom, leading to the formation of a carbenium ion. This carbenium ion then undergoes further reactions, including ring opening, to produce olefinic products. The carbenium mechanism suggests that the CH activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the slowest step in the series of reactions that lead to product formation. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the gallium atom's Lewis acid property to facilitate the activation of the propane molecule. The specific structure of the gallium species, whether it is in a framework, extra-framework, or on the external surface of the zeolite, influences the efficiency of the alkyl mechanism but does not fundamentally alter its applicability.

3. The yield in BTX reaches a maximum at 20% with a gallium content of 2.5 wt% on the microporous catalysts, while on the hierarchical zeolites, the BTX yields are significantly lower.

4. The solid ionic exchange proceeds during reduction treatment if the gallium content is sufficient, enabling a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic sites regardless of the initial gallium location.

5. The cracking activity of n-hexane is proportional to the concentration of the protonic sites probed by pyridine on the calcined catalysts, indicating that the catalysts recover their intrinsic acidic properties in the presence of hydrocarbons, highlighting the instability of gallium hydride species.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷的初始活化。这导致一个碳正离子中间体的形成。关键步骤包括由镓原子抽象出一个氢原子，导致碳正离子的形成。这个碳正离子然后进行后续反应，包括环裂解，以产生烯烃产品。碳正离子机制表明，CH活化步骤是决定性步骤，因为它是在一系列导致产物形成的反应中最慢的步骤。烷基机制适用于不同的镓物种结构，通过利用镓原子的路易斯酸性质来促进丙烷分子的活化。镓物种的具体结构，无论是框架、额外框架还是在沸石晶体表面，影响烷基机制的效率，但不从根本上改变其适用性。
