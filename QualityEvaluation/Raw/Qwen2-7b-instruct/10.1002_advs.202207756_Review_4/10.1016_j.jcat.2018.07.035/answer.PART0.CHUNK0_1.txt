[1] "The presence of mesopores reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal that mitigates the hydride transfer."
[2] "Regardless of the preparation method (MM or IE), the yield in BTX passes through a maximum at 20% with a gallium content of 2.5 wt%, while on all the hierarchical zeolites, the BTX yields are much lower (Fig. 9b)."
[3] "The cracking reaction which proceeds on acid sites decreases with the increase of gallium content (Fig. 9c), and totally disappears on the hierarchical zeolites from (5 wt%) and on the microporous material to reach a plateau at ca. 10% on the Ga + P series."
[4] "The initial activities of propane aromatization (AAR) are proportional to these of dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (AD) (Fig. 12)."

1. Mesopores reduce the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal, thus mitigating the hydride transfer process in reactions involving gallium-based catalysts.
2. Regardless of the preparation method, the maximum yield for BTX is achieved at 20% conversion with 2.5 wt% gallium content on microporous materials, whereas yields are notably lower on hierarchical zeolites.
3. The cracking reaction, which takes place on acid sites, decreases with an increase in gallium content. This reaction completely disappears on hierarchical zeolites beyond 5 wt% gallium and on microporous materials, reaching a plateau of approximately 10% on the Ga + P series.
4. The initial activities of propane aromatization (AAR) are directly proportional to the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (AD), indicating that the limiting step for AAR is the dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 球孔减少了烯烃在沸石晶体内的停留时间，从而减轻了氢化转移过程。
2. 不论制备方法如何，当二甲基硅烷的含量为2.5 wt%，转化率达到20%时，中间体的产量达到最大值，而对于分级沸石材料，中间体的产量明显较低。
3. 在增加镓含量的情况下，酸性位点上的裂解反应会减少。此反应在分级沸石材料中完全消失，在超过5 wt%的镓含量和微孔材料中达到10%左右的平台值。
4. 丙烷芳构化（AAR）的初始活性与环己烷脱氢的活性成正比，这表明限制步骤是丙烷脱氢。
