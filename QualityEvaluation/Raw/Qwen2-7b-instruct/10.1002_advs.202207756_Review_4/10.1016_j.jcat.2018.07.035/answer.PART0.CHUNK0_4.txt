[1] "Regardless of the initial gallium location, the solid ionic exchange proceeds during reduction treatment, if the gallium content is enough, up to a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic sites; the reduction time, relatively long (10 h) in this study do not allow estimating the potential gain of the used of hierarchical zeo- lite on the ionic exchange."
[2] "The cracking activity of n-hexane (a test) is proportional to the concentration of the protonic sites probed by the pyridine on the calcined catalysts and not on the reduced ones; the catalysts recov- ered their intrinsic acidic properties which indicates the instability of the gallium hydride species in presence of hydrocarbons."
[3] "The presence of mesopores reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal that mitigates the hydride transfer."
[4] "The presence of mesopores bears no gain on the coke deposition, the coke continues to be located on the zeolite micropores; but with gallium rich catalyst a steric retention of the coke precursors appears in the mesopores."
[5] "In conclusion, the hierarchization of zeolite is negative for the propane aromatization."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane molecules are activated by the interaction with a gallium atom (Ga) and a nearby zeolite oxygen (O), forming an alkyl-gallium intermediate. This step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most energetically demanding process - the breaking of a C-C bond in the propane molecule.

After activation, the alkyl-gallium intermediate undergoes a series of transformations. First, the gallium atom abstracts a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule, leading to the formation of an alkyl-gallium carbocation. This step is facilitated by the Lewis acidic property of gallium, which allows it to accept a proton from the alkyl group.

Next, the alkyl-gallium carbocation rearranges, losing a proton to the zeolite oxygen, forming an alkyl radical. This rearrangement step is crucial for the stability of the intermediate and is facilitated by the coordination of the alkyl group with the gallium atom.

Finally, the alkyl radical undergoes a β-scission, breaking the C-C bond and forming two alkene molecules. This step completes the PDH reaction, with the formation of two olefins as products.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism emphasizes the role of gallium in the dehydrogenation process. While both mechanisms involve the activation of a hydrocarbon molecule and the formation of a reactive intermediate, the alkyl mechanism specifically highlights the importance of the gallium atom in facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.

The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it requires the highest energy input among the series of transformations. The activation barrier for this step is influenced by factors such as the strength of the Ga-O bond and the electronic properties of the gallium species.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga2O3, Ga(NO3)3, and Ga/HZSM-5 zeolites. The structure and location of gallium within the catalyst determine the reactivity and stability of the alkyl-gallium intermediate, affecting the overall PDH activity.

The hierarchization of zeolite negatively impacts the propane aromatization reaction. The formation of intracrystalline mesopores during the desilication process enhances mass transfer but reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal. This mitigates the hydride transfer reaction, inhibiting the dehydrogenation activity and the propane dehydrocyclization reaction. The presence of mesopores also affects coke deposition, with gallium-rich catalysts showing a steric retention of coke precursors in the mesopores.

In conclusion, the alkyl mechanism describes the key steps in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts. It emphasizes the role of gallium in activating propane and facilitates the subsequent rearrangements and scissions to form olefin products. The hierarchization of zeolite negatively influences propane aromatization by reducing the reaction kinetics and affecting coke deposition patterns.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷分子通过与镓原子（Ga）和附近的沸石氧（O）的相互作用被激活，形成一个烷基-镓中间体。提出这一步骤作为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到最耗能的过程 - 破坏丙烷分子中的C-C键。

激活后，烷基-镓中间体经历了一系列转换。首先，镓原子从丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子，导致形成一个烷基-镓碳正离子。这一步骤由镓的Lewis酸性特性促进，它允许它从烷基集团接受一个质子。

接下来，烷基-镓碳正离子进行重组，失去一个质子给沸石氧，形成一个烷基自由基。这一步骤对于中间体的稳定性至关重要，并且由镓原子与烷基团的协同作用促进。

最后，烷基自由基进行β裂解，断裂C-C键并形成两个烯烃分子。这一步骤完成了PDH反应，形成了两个烯烃作为产物。

与碳烯机制相比，烷基机制强调了镓在脱氢过程中的作用。尽管两种机制都涉及烃类分子的活化和形成活性中间体，但烷基机制特别强调了镓原子在促进脱氢反应中的重要性。

CH活化步骤被提议为RDS，因为它在一系列转化中需要最高的能量输入。此步骤的能量壁垒受镓-O键强度和镓物种电子性质的影响。

烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga2O3、Ga(NO3)3和Ga/HZSM-5沸石。催化剂中镓的位置和结构决定了烷基-镓中间体的反应性和稳定性，影响整体PDH活性。

沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化反应产生负面影响。在脱硅过程中形成的内晶介孔增强了物质传输，但减少了烯烃在沸石晶体内的停留时间。这抑制了氢转移反应，降低了脱氢活性和丙烷脱氢环化反应。介孔的存在也影响焦炭沉积，镓含量高的催化剂显示出焦炭前体在介孔中的空间保留。

总之，烷基机制描述了丙烷脱氢反应中镓基催化剂的关键步骤。它强调了镓在激活丙烷和促进后续重排和裂解以形成烯烃产物的作用。沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化反应产生负面影响，通过降低反应动力学和影响焦炭沉积模式。
