[1] "Regardless of the initial gallium location, the solid ionic exchange proceeds during reduction treatment, if the gallium content is enough, up to a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic sites; the reduction time, relatively long (10 h) in this study do not allow estimating the potential gain of the used of hierarchical zeo- lite on the ionic exchange."
[2] "The cracking activity of n-hexane (a test) is proportional to the concentration of the protonic sites probed by the pyridine on the calcined catalysts and not on the reduced ones; the catalysts recovered their intrinsic acidic properties which indicates the instability of the gallium hydride species in presence of hydrocarbons."
[3] "The presence of mesopores reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal that mitigates the hydride transfer. A shorter residence time of paraffin and the weak acid Lewis sites of gallium created after desilication in comparison with that created on the microporous zeolite, inhibit drastically the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst as well as the propane dehydrocyclisation reaction since the kinetic limiting step of the reaction is the propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "In conclusion, the hierarchization of zeolite is negative for the propane aromatization."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane through a mechanism that requires the participation of both the zeolite oxygen atoms (acting as Lewis bases) and the gallium atom (acting as Lewis acids) to form an active bi-site. This active center facilitates the dehydrogenation process by stabilizing the carbocation intermediates. The key steps in the alkyl mechanism include the initial activation of propane, followed by the formation of a carbocation intermediate, and finally the dehydration to produce olefins. 

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is proposed because the activation of the alkyl group by the zeolite oxygen atoms allows for the stabilization of the carbocation intermediate, making the dehydrogenation process more efficient. The activation of the carbon-hydrogen bond in propane requires a strong Lewis base, which is provided by the zeolite oxygen atoms. This mechanism is supported by the fact that the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst is proportional to the concentration of protonic sites probed by pyridine on the calcined catalysts, indicating the recovery of intrinsic acidic properties that facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most energetically demanding step in the alkyl mechanism. The stability of the carbocation intermediate formed during this step plays a crucial role in determining the overall activity of the catalyst. The presence of weak acid Lewis sites of gallium created after desilication on the hierarchical zeolite reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal, mitigating the hydride transfer reaction. This results in a shorter residence time for paraffin and weaker acid Lewis sites compared to those created on the microporous zeolite, which inhibits the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst and the propane dehydrocyclisation reaction. Since the kinetic limiting step of PDH is the dehydrogenation of propane, the hierarchization of zeolite negatively impacts the propane aromatization process.

In conclusion, the hierarchization of zeolite negatively affects the propane aromatization process, as it impedes the efficient dehydrogenation of propane and reduces the activity of the catalyst. The alkyl mechanism provides a detailed insight into the dehydrogenation process on gallium-based catalysts, emphasizing the importance of the bi-site formed by the zeolite oxygen atoms and the gallium atom in facilitating the activation and dehydrogenation of propane.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及通过机制激活丙烷，该机制需要参与两个物种：沸石氧原子（作为Lewis碱）和镓原子（作为Lewis酸），形成活性双中心。这个活性中心通过稳定碳正离子中间体来促进脱氢过程。烷基机制的关键步骤包括丙烷的初始激活、形成碳正离子中间体以及最终脱水生成烯烃。

与卡宾机制相比，由于激活烷基组分需要强烈的Lewis碱，而由沸石氧原子提供的这种碱性使得碳正离子中间体的稳定性得到增强，因此烷基机制被提出。这表明脱氢活性与探针丙吡啶在煅烧催化剂上的酸性位点浓度成正比，表明恢复了催化活性，有助于脱氢过程。

CH激活步骤被认为是速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它在烷基机制中是最能动的步骤。形成的碳正离子中间体的稳定性决定了催化剂的整体活性。脱氢活性依赖于碳-氢键的激活，需要一个强大的Lewis碱，由沸石氧原子提供。烷基机制的详细洞察表明，镓在高岭土中的分级化减少了烯烃在沸石晶体内停留的时间，减轻了氢转移反应。这导致了在分级沸石中形成的较弱酸Lewis位点与在微孔沸石中形成的较弱酸Lewis位点相比，丙烷的停留时间更短，芳构化反应的活性降低。由于脱氢反应的热力学限制步骤是丙烷的脱氢，因此沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化过程产生负面影响。

总之，沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化过程产生负面影响，因为它阻碍了丙烷的高效脱氢和催化剂的活性降低。烷基机制为理解镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢的过程提供了详细的见解，强调了由沸石氧原子和镓原子共同形成的双中心在激活和脱氢丙烷中的重要性。
