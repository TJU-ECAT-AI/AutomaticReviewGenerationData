1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane. This activation leads to the formation of a carbenium intermediate. The key steps involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule by a gallium atom, leading to the formation of a carbenium ion. This carbenium ion then undergoes further reactions, including ring opening, to produce olefinic products. The carbenium mechanism suggests that the CH activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the slowest step in the series of reactions that lead to product formation. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the gallium atom's Lewis acid property to facilitate the activation of the propane molecule. The specific structure of the gallium species, whether it is in a framework, extra-framework, or on the external surface of the zeolite, influences the efficiency of the alkyl mechanism but does not fundamentally alter its applicability.

2. The carbenium mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts proposes that the activation of the propane molecule leads to the formation of a carbenium intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes subsequent reactions, including ring opening, to produce olefinic products. The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step because it is the slowest step in the series of reactions that lead to product formation. The alkyl mechanism utilizes the gallium atom's Lewis acid property to facilitate the activation of the propane molecule. The specific structure of the gallium species, whether it is in a framework, extra-framework, or on the external surface of the zeolite, influences the efficiency of the alkyl mechanism but does not fundamentally alter its applicability.

3. The yield in BTX reaches a maximum at 20% with a gallium content of 2.5 wt% on the microporous catalysts, while on the hierarchical zeolites, the BTX yields are significantly lower.

4. The solid ionic exchange proceeds during reduction treatment if the gallium content is sufficient, enabling a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic sites regardless of the initial gallium location.

5. The cracking activity of n-hexane is proportional to the concentration of the protonic sites probed by pyridine on the calcined catalysts, indicating that the catalysts recover their intrinsic acidic properties in the presence of hydrocarbons, highlighting the instability of gallium hydride species.

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by a Lewis acid site provided by the gallium species, followed by the transfer of an alkyl group to form a carbenium intermediate. This carbenium intermediate undergoes ring opening and subsequent hydrogen transfer to produce olefins and aromatics. The key steps involve the activation of propane by the gallium atom, leading to the formation of an alkyl species that facilitates the PDH process. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, where the activation step is by a carbocation, leading to the formation of a carbenium intermediate that subsequently reacts to form products. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most energetic and slowest step in the reaction pathway.

2. The alkyl mechanism for PDH on gallium-based catalysts applies to different Ga species structures as follows: 
- The gallium atom provides the Lewis acid site necessary for the activation of propane.
- Depending on the structure of the gallium species (such as Ga2O3, GaO+, or Ga+), the availability and strength of the Lewis acid site may vary, affecting the rate of activation and the efficiency of the PDH process.
- However, the fundamental steps of activation, formation of an alkyl species, ring opening, and hydrogen transfer remain consistent across different gallium species structures.

3. The hierarchicalization of zeolite negatively impacts the propane aromatization process by increasing the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal. This results in the mitigation of the hydride transfer reaction, which is the kinetic limiting step of the propane dehydrocyclization reaction. The presence of mesopores in the hierarchical zeolite reduces the residence time of olefins, thereby inhibiting the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst and the propane dehydrocyclization reaction.

4. The presence of gallium has no effect on the olefin yield in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as evidenced by Figure 11Bd. The yield in olefins is independent of the gallium content and preparation method (mechanical mixing or ionic exchange). This suggests that the formation of olefins is not influenced by the gallium species' role as a Lewis acid in the PDH mechanism.

5. The initial activities of propane aromatization (AAR) are proportional to the dehydrogenation activities of cyclohexane (AD) as shown in Figure 12. This indicates that the active site responsible for the propane aromatization process is equivalent to the dehydrogenating function. The limiting step in the propane aromatization reaction is the dehydrogenation of propane, which requires a high residence time inside the zeolite crystals. The balance ratio of dehydrogenating properties to acidic properties correlates with the AAR, suggesting that the activity is governed by the dehydrogenation rate.

1. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，通过镓基催化剂上的Lewis酸位点激活丙烷，随后通过转移烷基形成碳正离子中间体。该碳正离子中间体经历环开裂和后续氢转移生成烯烃和芳香族化合物。关键步骤包括丙烷通过镓原子的激活，导致形成烷基物种，促进PDH过程。这种机制与碳正离子机制不同，在此机制中，激活步骤由碳正离子提供，导致形成碳正离子中间体，随后进一步反应生成产物。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它涉及反应路径中最能动且最慢的步骤。

2. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢反应中应用于不同的镓物种结构如下：
- 镓原子提供提供Lewis酸位点，用于激活丙烷。
- 根据镓物种的结构（如Ga2O3、GaO+或Ga+），Lewis酸位点的可用性和强度可能有所不同，影响激活速率和PDH过程的效率。
- 不同于镓物种结构，基本步骤（激活、形成烷基物种、环开裂和氢转移）保持一致。

3. 介晶化对丙烷异构化过程产生负面影响，通过增加烯烃在介晶材料中的停留时间来缓解氢转移反应。这导致丙烷脱氢化反应的限速步骤——丙烷脱氢化反应。介晶孔的存在减少了烯烃在介晶材料中的停留时间，从而抑制催化剂的脱氢活性和丙烷脱氢化反应。

4. 镓在丙烷脱氢反应中的存在对烯烃产率没有影响，如图11Bd所示。烯烃产率独立于镓含量和制备方法（机械混合或离子交换）。这表明烯烃的形成不受镓物种作为PDH机制中Lewis酸的作用的影响。

5. 丙烷异构化的初始活性与环己烷脱氢活性成比例，如图12所示。这表明负责丙烷异构化过程的活性位点等同于脱氢功能。丙烷异构化反应的限制步骤是丙烷脱氢化，需要晶体内的高停留时间。脱氢率与脱氢性能和酸性能的平衡比率相关，表明活性受脱氢速率的控制。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane through a mechanism that requires the participation of both the zeolite oxygen atoms (acting as Lewis bases) and the gallium atom (acting as Lewis acids) to form an active bi-site. This active center facilitates the dehydrogenation process by stabilizing the carbocation intermediates. The key steps in the alkyl mechanism include the initial activation of propane, followed by the formation of a carbocation intermediate, and finally the dehydration to produce olefins. 

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is proposed because the activation of the alkyl group by the zeolite oxygen atoms allows for the stabilization of the carbocation intermediate, making the dehydrogenation process more efficient. The activation of the carbon-hydrogen bond in propane requires a strong Lewis base, which is provided by the zeolite oxygen atoms. This mechanism is supported by the fact that the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst is proportional to the concentration of protonic sites probed by pyridine on the calcined catalysts, indicating the recovery of intrinsic acidic properties that facilitate the dehydrogenation process.

The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most energetically demanding step in the alkyl mechanism. The stability of the carbocation intermediate formed during this step plays a crucial role in determining the overall activity of the catalyst. The presence of weak acid Lewis sites of gallium created after desilication on the hierarchical zeolite reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal, mitigating the hydride transfer reaction. This results in a shorter residence time for paraffin and weaker acid Lewis sites compared to those created on the microporous zeolite, which inhibits the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst and the propane dehydrocyclisation reaction. Since the kinetic limiting step of PDH is the dehydrogenation of propane, the hierarchization of zeolite negatively impacts the propane aromatization process.

In conclusion, the hierarchization of zeolite negatively affects the propane aromatization process, as it impedes the efficient dehydrogenation of propane and reduces the activity of the catalyst. The alkyl mechanism provides a detailed insight into the dehydrogenation process on gallium-based catalysts, emphasizing the importance of the bi-site formed by the zeolite oxygen atoms and the gallium atom in facilitating the activation and dehydrogenation of propane.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及通过机制激活丙烷，该机制需要参与两个物种：沸石氧原子（作为Lewis碱）和镓原子（作为Lewis酸），形成活性双中心。这个活性中心通过稳定碳正离子中间体来促进脱氢过程。烷基机制的关键步骤包括丙烷的初始激活、形成碳正离子中间体以及最终脱水生成烯烃。

与卡宾机制相比，由于激活烷基组分需要强烈的Lewis碱，而由沸石氧原子提供的这种碱性使得碳正离子中间体的稳定性得到增强，因此烷基机制被提出。这表明脱氢活性与探针丙吡啶在煅烧催化剂上的酸性位点浓度成正比，表明恢复了催化活性，有助于脱氢过程。

CH激活步骤被认为是速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它在烷基机制中是最能动的步骤。形成的碳正离子中间体的稳定性决定了催化剂的整体活性。脱氢活性依赖于碳-氢键的激活，需要一个强大的Lewis碱，由沸石氧原子提供。烷基机制的详细洞察表明，镓在高岭土中的分级化减少了烯烃在沸石晶体内停留的时间，减轻了氢转移反应。这导致了在分级沸石中形成的较弱酸Lewis位点与在微孔沸石中形成的较弱酸Lewis位点相比，丙烷的停留时间更短，芳构化反应的活性降低。由于脱氢反应的热力学限制步骤是丙烷的脱氢，因此沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化过程产生负面影响。

总之，沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化过程产生负面影响，因为它阻碍了丙烷的高效脱氢和催化剂的活性降低。烷基机制为理解镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢的过程提供了详细的见解，强调了由沸石氧原子和镓原子共同形成的双中心在激活和脱氢丙烷中的重要性。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane molecules are activated by the interaction with a gallium atom (Ga) and a nearby zeolite oxygen (O), forming an alkyl-gallium intermediate. This step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most energetically demanding process - the breaking of a C-C bond in the propane molecule.

After activation, the alkyl-gallium intermediate undergoes a series of transformations. First, the gallium atom abstracts a hydrogen atom from the propane molecule, leading to the formation of an alkyl-gallium carbocation. This step is facilitated by the Lewis acidic property of gallium, which allows it to accept a proton from the alkyl group.

Next, the alkyl-gallium carbocation rearranges, losing a proton to the zeolite oxygen, forming an alkyl radical. This rearrangement step is crucial for the stability of the intermediate and is facilitated by the coordination of the alkyl group with the gallium atom.

Finally, the alkyl radical undergoes a β-scission, breaking the C-C bond and forming two alkene molecules. This step completes the PDH reaction, with the formation of two olefins as products.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism emphasizes the role of gallium in the dehydrogenation process. While both mechanisms involve the activation of a hydrocarbon molecule and the formation of a reactive intermediate, the alkyl mechanism specifically highlights the importance of the gallium atom in facilitating the dehydrogenation reaction.

The CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it requires the highest energy input among the series of transformations. The activation barrier for this step is influenced by factors such as the strength of the Ga-O bond and the electronic properties of the gallium species.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including Ga2O3, Ga(NO3)3, and Ga/HZSM-5 zeolites. The structure and location of gallium within the catalyst determine the reactivity and stability of the alkyl-gallium intermediate, affecting the overall PDH activity.

The hierarchization of zeolite negatively impacts the propane aromatization reaction. The formation of intracrystalline mesopores during the desilication process enhances mass transfer but reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal. This mitigates the hydride transfer reaction, inhibiting the dehydrogenation activity and the propane dehydrocyclization reaction. The presence of mesopores also affects coke deposition, with gallium-rich catalysts showing a steric retention of coke precursors in the mesopores.

In conclusion, the alkyl mechanism describes the key steps in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts. It emphasizes the role of gallium in activating propane and facilitates the subsequent rearrangements and scissions to form olefin products. The hierarchization of zeolite negatively influences propane aromatization by reducing the reaction kinetics and affecting coke deposition patterns.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷分子通过与镓原子（Ga）和附近的沸石氧（O）的相互作用被激活，形成一个烷基-镓中间体。提出这一步骤作为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到最耗能的过程 - 破坏丙烷分子中的C-C键。

激活后，烷基-镓中间体经历了一系列转换。首先，镓原子从丙烷分子中提取一个氢原子，导致形成一个烷基-镓碳正离子。这一步骤由镓的Lewis酸性特性促进，它允许它从烷基集团接受一个质子。

接下来，烷基-镓碳正离子进行重组，失去一个质子给沸石氧，形成一个烷基自由基。这一步骤对于中间体的稳定性至关重要，并且由镓原子与烷基团的协同作用促进。

最后，烷基自由基进行β裂解，断裂C-C键并形成两个烯烃分子。这一步骤完成了PDH反应，形成了两个烯烃作为产物。

与碳烯机制相比，烷基机制强调了镓在脱氢过程中的作用。尽管两种机制都涉及烃类分子的活化和形成活性中间体，但烷基机制特别强调了镓原子在促进脱氢反应中的重要性。

CH活化步骤被提议为RDS，因为它在一系列转化中需要最高的能量输入。此步骤的能量壁垒受镓-O键强度和镓物种电子性质的影响。

烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括Ga2O3、Ga(NO3)3和Ga/HZSM-5沸石。催化剂中镓的位置和结构决定了烷基-镓中间体的反应性和稳定性，影响整体PDH活性。

沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化反应产生负面影响。在脱硅过程中形成的内晶介孔增强了物质传输，但减少了烯烃在沸石晶体内的停留时间。这抑制了氢转移反应，降低了脱氢活性和丙烷脱氢环化反应。介孔的存在也影响焦炭沉积，镓含量高的催化剂显示出焦炭前体在介孔中的空间保留。

总之，烷基机制描述了丙烷脱氢反应中镓基催化剂的关键步骤。它强调了镓在激活丙烷和促进后续重排和裂解以形成烯烃产物的作用。沸石的分级化对丙烷芳构化反应产生负面影响，通过降低反应动力学和影响焦炭沉积模式。
