[1] "The presence of mesopores reduces the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal that mitigates the hydride transfer."
[2] "Regardless of the initial gallium location, the solid ionic exchange proceeds during reduction treatment, if the gallium content is enough, up to a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic sites; the reduction time, relatively long (10 h) in this study do not allow estimating the potential gain of the used of hierarchical zeo- lite on the ionic exchange."
[3] "Regardless of the preparation method (MM or IE), the yield in BTX passes through a maximum at 20% with a gallium content of 2.5 wt%, while on all the hierarchical zeolites, the BTX yields are much lower (Fig. 9b)."
[4] "Regardless of the preparation method (MM or IE), the presence of gallium has no effect on the olefin yield (Fig. 11Bd)."
[5] "The initial activities of propane aromatization (AAR) are proportional to these of dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (AD) (Fig. 12)."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by a Lewis acid site provided by the gallium species, followed by the transfer of an alkyl group to form a carbenium intermediate. This carbenium intermediate undergoes ring opening and subsequent hydrogen transfer to produce olefins and aromatics. The key steps involve the activation of propane by the gallium atom, leading to the formation of an alkyl species that facilitates the PDH process. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, where the activation step is by a carbocation, leading to the formation of a carbenium intermediate that subsequently reacts to form products. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most energetic and slowest step in the reaction pathway.

2. The alkyl mechanism for PDH on gallium-based catalysts applies to different Ga species structures as follows: 
- The gallium atom provides the Lewis acid site necessary for the activation of propane.
- Depending on the structure of the gallium species (such as Ga2O3, GaO+, or Ga+), the availability and strength of the Lewis acid site may vary, affecting the rate of activation and the efficiency of the PDH process.
- However, the fundamental steps of activation, formation of an alkyl species, ring opening, and hydrogen transfer remain consistent across different gallium species structures.

3. The hierarchicalization of zeolite negatively impacts the propane aromatization process by increasing the residence time of olefins within the zeolite crystal. This results in the mitigation of the hydride transfer reaction, which is the kinetic limiting step of the propane dehydrocyclization reaction. The presence of mesopores in the hierarchical zeolite reduces the residence time of olefins, thereby inhibiting the dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst and the propane dehydrocyclization reaction.

4. The presence of gallium has no effect on the olefin yield in propane dehydrogenation reactions, as evidenced by Figure 11Bd. The yield in olefins is independent of the gallium content and preparation method (mechanical mixing or ionic exchange). This suggests that the formation of olefins is not influenced by the gallium species' role as a Lewis acid in the PDH mechanism.

5. The initial activities of propane aromatization (AAR) are proportional to the dehydrogenation activities of cyclohexane (AD) as shown in Figure 12. This indicates that the active site responsible for the propane aromatization process is equivalent to the dehydrogenating function. The limiting step in the propane aromatization reaction is the dehydrogenation of propane, which requires a high residence time inside the zeolite crystals. The balance ratio of dehydrogenating properties to acidic properties correlates with the AAR, suggesting that the activity is governed by the dehydrogenation rate.

1. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，通过镓基催化剂上的Lewis酸位点激活丙烷，随后通过转移烷基形成碳正离子中间体。该碳正离子中间体经历环开裂和后续氢转移生成烯烃和芳香族化合物。关键步骤包括丙烷通过镓原子的激活，导致形成烷基物种，促进PDH过程。这种机制与碳正离子机制不同，在此机制中，激活步骤由碳正离子提供，导致形成碳正离子中间体，随后进一步反应生成产物。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它涉及反应路径中最能动且最慢的步骤。

2. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢反应中应用于不同的镓物种结构如下：
- 镓原子提供提供Lewis酸位点，用于激活丙烷。
- 根据镓物种的结构（如Ga2O3、GaO+或Ga+），Lewis酸位点的可用性和强度可能有所不同，影响激活速率和PDH过程的效率。
- 不同于镓物种结构，基本步骤（激活、形成烷基物种、环开裂和氢转移）保持一致。

3. 介晶化对丙烷异构化过程产生负面影响，通过增加烯烃在介晶材料中的停留时间来缓解氢转移反应。这导致丙烷脱氢化反应的限速步骤——丙烷脱氢化反应。介晶孔的存在减少了烯烃在介晶材料中的停留时间，从而抑制催化剂的脱氢活性和丙烷脱氢化反应。

4. 镓在丙烷脱氢反应中的存在对烯烃产率没有影响，如图11Bd所示。烯烃产率独立于镓含量和制备方法（机械混合或离子交换）。这表明烯烃的形成不受镓物种作为PDH机制中Lewis酸的作用的影响。

5. 丙烷异构化的初始活性与环己烷脱氢活性成比例，如图12所示。这表明负责丙烷异构化过程的活性位点等同于脱氢功能。丙烷异构化反应的限制步骤是丙烷脱氢化，需要晶体内的高停留时间。脱氢率与脱氢性能和酸性能的平衡比率相关，表明活性受脱氢速率的控制。
