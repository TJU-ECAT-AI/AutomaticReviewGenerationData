Gallium containing ZSM-5 zeolites were prepared by ion exchange and mechanical mixture from the par-
ent ZSM-5 and two desilicated zeolites to be tested in propane aromatization. The alkaline treatment was
made by sodium hydroxide, with or without tetrabutylammonium hydroxide. The catalysts prepared
from desilicated zeolites are less active in propane aromatization and cyclohexane transformation and
less selective into aromatics than those prepared from the parent zeolite. The desilication did not affect
the acid properties, especially the strength of acid sites as seen by CO adsorption at 77 K and n-hexane
cracking.

1. Introduction
The selective transformation of light alkanes into aromatics,
that are more valuable and versatile feedstocks for the chemical
industry, becomes again one of the major challenges of catalytic
chemistry. ZSM-5 doped with gallium is a bifunctional and good
proven catalyst for the aromatization of propane [1]. Ga can be
incorporated into zeolite by different methods: ionic exchange
[2–5], impregnation using Ga salts [6–8], mechanical mixing of
Ga2O3 [9,10] with zeolite followed by thermal treatment. These
different preparation methods of the bifunctional catalyst result
in different possible initial locations of gallium: framework,
extra-framework, exchange position or on external surface, as well
as different oxidation states (0, +I, +III) [9,11–13]. At high temper-
ature and under hydrogen atmosphere (T > 873 K), a reductive
solid ionic exchange occurs through the diffusion of gallium subox-
ide in the zeolite micropores [7,9,14–22].
The creation of mesopores connected to the zeolite micropores
appears as a simple method to improve both the diffusion of the
mobile species and the level of connection between the two net-
works as well their diffusion efﬁciency. Through NaOH desilication
[23], intracrystalline mesopores are created and the concentration
of Brønsted acid sites are maintained, while the addition of a sur-
factant agent, such as tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH),
allows mesopores shaping [24].
The intracrystalline mesopores are like ‘‘highways” for mobile
gallium species, the reactants and the products, improving both
the accessibility of Ga2O to protonic sites, the reactants to the
active ‘‘bi-sites” (gallium cations and neighboring zeolite oxygen
anions [25]) and products desorption.
The increase of the catalyst’s lifetime on the hierarchical zeolite
is attributed to the enhancement of the mass transfer of products
(coke precursors) to the external surface where they accumulate.
Therefore, hierarchized materials appear to be more susceptible
to coking; more coke is required to totally deactivate the catalyst
[26,27].
Ogunronbi et al. [27] have shown, that the presence of
intracrystalline mesopores is also beneﬁcial for the aromatic com-
pounds yield due to better penetration of gallium species within
the zeolite crystal either during the cationic exchange or/and the
reduction treatment. These combined effects result in the forma-
tion of a larger number of active species (gallium hydride) and a
better distribution (Dispersion).
The aim of this study is to conﬁrm that the presence of
intracrystalline mesopores is beneﬁcial to propane dehydrocycliza-
tion. Two series of bifunctional catalysts were prepared by
mechanical mixture and ionic exchange from a ZSM-5 zeolite desil-
icated by NaOH with or without TBAOH; the gallium content rang-
ing up to 6.8 wt%. The nature and acidic properties, concentration
and strength of sites were characterized by using two probe mole-
cules, pyridine for the nature and the number of acid sites and CO
for their strength. The acidic, dehydrogenation and dehydrocyclisa-
tion properties were evaluated by using three model reactions:

aromatization, respectively.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The generation of mesopores inside a commercial NH4-ZSM-5
zeolite (CBV 8014) was carried out by using NaOH (0.2M,
pH = 13.3 at 298 K) [23], or NaOH with TBAOH ([TBAOH + NaOH]
= 0.2) [24], at 338 K for 30 min. The pH of solution after the alkaline
treatment is around 12. The solution is cooled in ice in order to
stop the zeolite modiﬁcation. The desilicated zeolites, noted HNaOH
and HNaOH+TBAOH, respectively, were calcined at 773 K for 12 h, then
exchanged by a solution of NH4NO3 at 333 K for 1 h (three times),
dried and calcined at 773 K for 12 h. HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH were
washed with a solution of 0.1M HCl at 343 K for 6 h, then washed
with distilled water, dried and calcined at 773 K.
The bifunctional catalysts with different gallium content were
prepared by mechanical mixture (MM) (0.5–10 wt% Ga) or ionic
exchange (IE) (0.5–6.8 wt% Ga)]. MM series (Ga+ zeolite), were
simply obtained by mixing the zeolite (P, HNaOH or HNaOH+TBAOH)
with b-Ga2O3 (purity 99.99%; Alfa Aesar); where P is the proton
form obtained by calcination of the NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite in a mufﬂe
furnace at 773 K (5 K min1) for 12 h.
The powders were mixed and milled several times in a mortar
to ensure a homogeneous distribution of the catalysts. The bifunc-
tional catalysts obtained by mechanical mixture will be named as
follows: Ga + P, Ga + HNaOH and Ga + HNaOH+TBAOH. IE series (Ga/zeo-
lite) was carried out at 373 K for 3 h with Ga(NO3)3 (purity 99.90%;
Sigma Aldrich) by using a volume of the exchange solution per
gram of zeolite of 100. Then, the material was calcined at 773 K
for 12 h with a temperature increasing rate of 5 K min1. The
bifunctional catalysts obtained by ionic exchange will be named
as follows: Ga/P, Ga/HNaOH and Ga/HNaOH+TBAOH.
2.2. Characterization
The elemental composition of the bifunctional catalysts (Si, Al,
Ga) was measured by using inductively coupled plasma-atomic
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) on an Optima 2000 DV (Perkin-
Elmer). The crystals size and morphology were determined by
scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) on a FEG-SEMJEOL micro-
scope (JSM 5600—LV model) and by transmission electronic micro-
scopy (TEM) on a Philips CM 120 microscope equipped with a LaB6
ﬁlament. The crystallinity of the zeolite was obtained by using a
PAN analytical (X’Pert Pro MPD) diffractometer over a 5–50 2h
range using the CuKa radiation (a = 154.05 pm). The textural prop-
erties were determined by nitrogen sorption measurements at
77 K, on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 gas adsorption analyser. Prior
to measurement, the samples were outgassed at 623 K for 4 h after
a plateau at 363 K for 1 h. The acidity of the samples and the
strength of the OH groups were measured by adsorption of two
probe molecules followed by infrared spectroscopy: pyridine at
423 K and carbon monoxide at 77 K, respectively. CO is injected
stepwise in the IR Cell through a calibrated volume (0.9837 cm3)
pressurized between 50 and 500 mbar. The FT-IR measurements
were carried out on a Nicolet 750 Magma FTIR 550 spectrometer
(resolution 2 cm1). Samples were pressed into thin wafers
(20 mg) and activated in situ in the IR cell under secondary vac-
uum (106 mbar) at 623 K. Prior to measurement, the samples
were treated for 12 h either under air (100 mL min1) at 723 K
(2 K min1) or under hydrogen (100 mL min1) at 873 K. Adsorp-
tion of pyridine at 423 K probed the BrØnsted and Lewis acid sites
and their concentrations were calculated by integrating the band
areas at 1545 and 1451 cm1 by using extinction coefﬁcients
1.13 and 1.28 cmµmol1, respectively [28]. The temperature-
programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out
using
a
Quantachrome
Autosorb
1-C
analyser.
The
catalyst
(200 mg) was pre-treated in situ at 373 K (5 K min1) for 1 h under
helium (He) ﬂow (30 mL min1). After cooling to room tempera-
ture under He (30 mL min1), the reduction was carried out up to
1273 K under H2 (1 vol%) diluted in argon (Ar) with a ﬂow rate of
30 mL min1 and a heating rate of 5 K min1.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Cyclohexane transformation at 803 K: the bifunctional catalysts
(100 mg) were reduced under hydrogen (90 mL min1) at 873 K
for 10 h. The cyclohexane transformation was carried out in a
down-ﬂow ﬁxed-bed reactor at 803 K, at atmospheric pressure
with a H2/cyclohexane molar ratio of 16 and a contact time
(1/WHSV) of 0.08 s. The products were analysed on-line with a
gas chromatograph (Varian 3400 X) equipped with a ﬂame ioniza-
tion detector connected to a capillary column (PLOT/Al2O3, 50 m,
di = 530 µm).
n-Hexane cracking at 803 K: the bifunctional catalysts (60 mg)
were reduced under hydrogen ﬂow (50 mL min1) at 873 K for
10 h. The n-hexane cracking was carried out in a top-ﬂow ﬁxed-
bed reactor at 803 K under atmospheric pressure with N2/n-C6
molar ratio of 34 and a contact time of 0.04 s. The products were
analysed on-line with a gas chromatography (VARIAN 450)
equipped with a ﬂame ionized detector connected to a capillary
column (Al2O3/KCl: 50 m, di = 320 µm).
Propane aromatization at 803 K: the bifunctional catalysts
(300 mg) were reduced under hydrogen (60 mL min1) at 873 K
for 10 h. The propane dehydrocyclisation was carried out in a top
ﬂow ﬁxed bed reactor at 803 K under 0.1 MPa of propane (purity:
100%, Air Liquid) and a contact time of 0.18 s. The products were
analysed on-line using a gas chromatography (7890A Agilent)
equipped with a TCD connected to a mole sieve column (13 X,
1.5 m, di = 0.2 mm) and a FID linked to a capillary column (CP-Sil
PONA CB, 100 m, di = 250 µm).
3. Results and discussion
The textural and acidic properties of the parent zeolite (P) and
the two hierarchical zeolites (HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH) are summa-
rized in Table 1. Fig. 1 compares the nitrogen adsorption isotherm
of the parent (P) and the two desilicated zeolites (HNaOH and
HNaOH+TBAOH). The parent zeolite exhibits a type I isotherm with a
small increase at high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.9) due to the for-
mation of few mesopores by the agglomeration of zeolite crystals
(Vinter
meso = 0.04 cm3 g1). Upon alkaline treatment, the shape of the
isotherm changes signiﬁcantly and can be described as a combina-
tion of type I and type IV isotherms, with a hysteresis loop indicat-
ing the presence of mesopores (Vmeso = 0.38 cm3 g1) for the HNaOH

zeolite. The pore size distribution calculated from BJH-equation
applied to the desorption branch shows a broad size distribution
ranging from 2 to 7 nm (Fig. 1b). The addition of surfactant to
the sodium hydroxide yields to a widening of the hysteresis loop
(Fig. 1a), a sign of a more homogenous mesopores size; the pore
size distribution is narrower ranging from 1 to 3 nm (Fig. 1b).
The creation of intracrystalline mesopores by desilication treat-
ment has practically no impact on the micropore volume (0.15–
0.17 cm3 g1), contrariwise to the external surface area that
mechanically increased (Table 1).
Fig. 2 displays the scanning and transmission electronic micro-
scopy images (SEM and TEM, respectively) of the three zeolites: P,
HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH. The SEM image of P shows large spherical
crystals with a diameter of 600 nm which are slightly agglomer-
ated. Upon the alkaline treatment, part of the crystals is dissolved
(the
desilication
yields
are
51.6%
and
80%
for
HNaOH
and
HNaOH+TBAOH, respectively) causing slight modiﬁcations of the
surface of zeolite crystals that appear rougher (SEM images). The
zeolite dissolution occurs also within the zeolite crystal generating
some mesopores which are visible in the TEM images. The TEM
images conﬁrm that the size of mesopores on HNaOH are larger than
on HNaOH+TBAOH.
Fig. 3 compares the infrared spectra in the OH stretching region
of the parent and the two desilicated zeolites. P displays four IR
bands: a low broad band between 3300 and 3550 cm1, which cor-
responds to the internal hydroxyl nests [29], an intense band at
3610 cm1 assigned to the bridged hydroxyl groups (Si-OH-Al), a

small one at 3670 cm1 related to the extraframework aluminium
(EFAL) [30], and a dissymmetric band at 3740 cm1 attributed to
the silanol groups on the external surface of the zeolite crystals
and/or mesopore walls; the shoulder at 3730 cm1 matches to
the Si-OH in the defects [29]. The disappearance of the bands asso-
ciated to crystal defects (i.e. internal silanol and hydroxyl nests)
after the alkaline treatments with or without TBAOH (Fig. 3),
shows that silicon extraction of zeolite framework proceeds prefer-
entially through the imperfections of the zeolite crystals [29]. The
slight decrease of the Si-OH-Al band concomitant to the slight
increase of the band related to EFAL, indicates that during the alka-
line dissolution of the zeolite, a small part of Al is also extracted,
probably due to partial collapse of the zeolite framework [24].
The creation of intracrystalline mesopores automatically causes
an increase in the external and BET surfaces, there after the
amount of terminal silanols band (3440 cm1) increases.
The Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are quantiﬁed using the IR
bands appearing at 1545 cm1 (PyH+) and 1454 cm1 (PyL) after
pyridine adsorption at 423 K. On P sample, the concentration of
Bronsted acid site (BAS) able to retain pyridine at 423 K is
304 µmol g1, that corresponds to 75% of the theoretical acidity
(407 µmol g1). The alkaline treatments with or without TBAOH
preserve the majority of protonic sites (c.a. 75%), and the genera-
tion of new Lewis acid sites related to EFAL species remains limited
(Table 1).
The impact of the alkaline treatments on the strength of the
acidic sites is investigated by using the adsorption of carbon
monoxide at 77 K followed by FTIR. CO, which is a weak base, is
extremely sensitive to the chemical properties of the adsorption
sites, as well as their geometrical conﬁguration [31]. This probe
molecule, adapted to study the strength of zeolite acid sites [32],
forms hydrogen bond with acidic OH groups through the lone pair
of electrons located on the carbon atom. The resulting elongation
of O-H bond is observed in the infrared spectrum as lowering the
stretching frequency of hydrogen-bonded O-H groups which, in
turn, depends primarily on the intrinsic acidity of each hydroxyl
group.
Fig. 4 displays the series of spectra in the v(OH) region (above
part) and in the v(CO) region (below part) for the three samples.
The spectrum are all presented as difference plots; i.e. the subtrac-
tion of spectra after and before adsorption of carbon monoxide at
77 K. The positive signals in these difference spectra correspond
to the perturbed OH groups, while the negative signals are related
to their position in the initial spectrum. On P sample, the CO
adsorption causes a red-shift both of the bridging OH (3616 ?
3306 cm1 [29]) and hydroxylated EFAL (3670 ? 3426 cm1) and
the formation of the CO stretching band at 2175 cm1. The higher
the shift, the stronger the acid strength is [33]; the strength of
bridged OH groups (DvOH = 310 cm1) is higher than that of EFAL
species (224 cm1). The alkaline treatment yields a slight lower
red-shift of bridging OH on HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH, (318 and
315 cm1, respectively), indicating that the desilication treatment
did not alter the acid strength of Brønsted acid sites signiﬁcantly.
Indeed, Holm et al. have shown that the acid strength of a ZSM-5
zeolite is unaffected by the alkaline leaching [29]. From high CO
coverage, supplementary shoulders appears at 3475–3452 cm1
as well as a band at 2138 cm1 [34], assigned to liquid like CO.
The presence of these bands is simply due to the fact that the
masses of wafer of HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH are lower than this of
P (17 and 22 against 31 mg).
Fig. 5 compares the TEM images of the two catalysts prepared
by ionic exchange of Ga(NO3)3 with P and the desilicated (HNaOH)
zeolites: 0.9%Ga/P and 0.5%Ga/HNaOH, respectively.
After calcination at 723 K, it is important to remark the quasi-
absence of gallium oxide on the TEM image of the hierarchical
zeolite while on the microporous material it is easy to identify
the oxides (Ga2O3 = needles). This clear difference cannot be only
due to the metal content, since on 0.9 %Ga/P it is three times lower
than that required for a complete exchange with the zeolite pro-
tonic sites. The more probable explanation is that the change
comes from to a better diffusion of the hydrated gallium cation
within the zeolite crystal owing to the intracrystalline mesopores
generated during the alkaline treatment. On the purely microp-
orous material, [Ga(H2O)6]3+ is too large to penetrate inside the
zeolite micropores [35], therefore it accumulates on the external
surface as needles. After reduction at 873 K, the needles of gallium
oxide disappear with the appearance of spheres (ø = 7.1 nm) on the
zeolite external surface, probably being the nanoparticles of gal-
lium oxide. Upon the treatment under hydrogen, Ga2O3 is reduced
into Ga2O, as already seen in the TPR experiment, that migrates
within the zeolite micropores and exchange with the protonic sites
[7,9,14,16,22].
Regardless of the zeolite used (P, HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH) and of
gallium content (0.5 and 5 wt%), the intensities of OH bands (Fig. 6)
are identical before and after ionic exchange followed by calcina-
tion at 723 K (IE-Cal). The concentrations of Brønsted and Lewis
acid sites are nearly similar before and after IE-Cal. The difference
can reach 15%, could be due to a partial pore blockage by the gal-
lium oxide (Table 2) located either on the external surface of the
microporous material or within the mesopores of the hierarchical
zeolites. Lewis acid sites are created mainly on the IE series, ca
30–40 µmol g1; the needles of gallium oxide in intimacy with
the zeolite generate new acidic sites that coordinate pyridine.
After reduction on all catalysts, only the band of bridged OH
groups (3611 cm1) that decreases, and the diminution rate is gal-
lium content dependent: partial with 0.5 wt%, total with 5 wt%.
The disappearance of the band at 3611 cm1 indicates that an ionic
exchange occurs during the reduction, whatever was the initial
location of the gallium oxide (external surface or mesopore) and
the diffusion step of gallium suboxide does not seem limiting.
The reduction causes signiﬁcant changes in comparison to the
starting zeolite, i.e. decrease of the concentration of Brønsted acid
sites ([PyH+]), concomitant to the increase of that of Lewis acid
sites [PyL]. On the bifunctional catalyst prepared by mechanical
mixture (MM) with a high content of gallium (5 wt%), the number
of Ga/BAS increases after reduction from 2.6 to 3.4 (Table 3).
Regardless of the pre-treatment, Ga/BAS is higher on the hierarchi-
cal zeolites than on microporous one; the mesopores promoting
the diffusion of gallium. On the bifunctional catalysts prepared
by ion exchange with a low Ga content (0.5 wt%), whatever the
pretreatment and hierarchic character of the zeolite, Ga/BAS is ca
0.5.
The ﬁnal acid Brønsted concentration on the microporous and
hierarchical catalysts after reduction are close (130 µmol g1)
whatever was both the preparation method used (IE or MM) and
the gallium content, except on 5%Ga + P with [PyH+] = 229 µmol g1.
The concentration of Lewis acid sites after reduction is high and
depends on the preparation method, the presence of intracristal-
line mesopores and on gallium content. [PyL] is favored with
mechanical mixture of at high gallium content and a microporous
material. In a recent paper, Schreiber et al [36] found that Ga/MFI
catalyst prepared by incipient wetness leads after in situ reduction
to the formation of two types of Lewis acid sites with bands at
1457 cm1 and 1446 cm1, assigned to coordinatively adsorbed
pyridine on Ga+ and GaxOy species, respectively. The concentration
of the cationic species increases with the Ga loading while the
other appears from samples with Ga/Al molar ratio >0.5. The
deconvolution of the band of LAS after reduction of microporous
and hierarchical bifunctional catalysts gives a small band at
1447 cm1 and a large one at 1457 cm1 (Fig. SI.1 and Table SI.1).
It should be noted that only on the microporous material,
especially with 5%Ga + P, the band related to Ga+ shifts by 3 cm1
226
M. Raad et al. / Journal of Catalysis 366 (2018) 223–236
to a position similar to that of extraframework gallium species in
the gallosilicate. The higher wavenumber of the LAS on bifunc-
tional catalysts points to a site that acts as slight stronger LAS
towards pyridine.

Assuming that the cationic exchange between Ga and H+ spe-
cies occurs with a stoichiometry of 1:3, the percentage of gallium
involved in the solid reducing exchange is 80% on the bifunctional
catalyst prepared by ionic exchange (needle of Ga2O3, Fig. 5) and
less than 4% on that prepared by mechanical mixture (bulk Ga2O3).
The acidic properties of the gallium based catalysts are charac-
terized by a model reaction: n-hexane cracking [37]. This test reac-
tion is carried out on reduced catalysts at 873 K by using the same
reaction temperature as that of propane transformation, i.e. 803 K.
It should be remarked that this temperature is close to that sug-
gested by Mobil for the a test: 811 K [1]. A short contact time
(0.04 s), almost 5 times lower than that used for the propane arom-
atization, allows limiting the conversion to 20% on the most acidic
catalyst, i.e. P (Table 1), in order to mitigate the deactivation by
coking. All the catalysts deactivate time-on-stream (Fig. 7a), how-
ever, their stability increases with gallium content (Fig. 7b) or

rather with the decrease of the concentration of Brønsted acid sites
(Table 2). Regardless of both the gallium content and the prepara-
tion method used (MM or IE), as well as the presence of intracris-
talline mesopores, the initial activity (A0) is proportional to the
concentration of Brønsted acid sites measured on the calcined cat-
alysts (Fig. 7c) and not after reduction (Fig. 7d). Regardless of both
the gallium content and concentration of protonic sites, the micro-
porous zeolites are almost three times more active than the hierar-
ched zeolites. A0 depends in the reduced catalysts, on the zeolite
textural properties only that seem unlikely. The proportionality
between A0 and [PyH+]cal is quasi identical to that obtained on
the series of protonic H-ZSM-5 zeolite with an acidity ranging from
100 to 500 µmolg1 (Fig. 7c). Therefore, it assumes that the acidic
properties of the reduced catalysts change rapidly under the oper-
ating conditions of the reaction to become identical to that mea-
sured on the calcined catalysts. Moreover, the bridged OH groups
appear again on the bifunctional catalyst after propane transfor-
mation at high temperature (Fig. SI.2).
Regardless of both the gallium content and the hierarchic char-
acter of the zeolite, the n-hexane cracking yields in C1, C2, C3, C4, C5
hydrocarbons which are formed in strictly parallel reactions
(Fig. 7e), that is typical of a monomolecular cracking mechanism
(M); M occurring at higher temperature (>800 K) than the bimolec-
ular one (650 K) [38]. The presence of gallium cations have neither
an impact on the mechanism of n-C6cracking, nor on the dehydro-
genation of the alkane. Indeed, the yields into oleﬁns (O) and paraf-
ﬁn (P) (Fig. 7f), or the P/O (Fig. 7g) molar ratio are more impacted
by the presence of intracristalline mesopores than the content of
the dehydrogenating function. The yields in O appear slightly
higher on the hierarchical zeolite than on the microporous ones.
This means that the contact time is too short to allow the dehydro-
genation of alkane on gallium cation, and that the presence of
intracrystalline mesopores limits the hydride transfer reaction
owing to faster desorption of oleﬁns. The coke, which results of a
multitude of reactions such as oligomerization, cyclisation and
hydrogen transfer, etc, appears on the acidic and bifunctional cat-
alysts at very low conversion (3%), and on the hierarchical catalysts
the coke appears as a quasi-primary products despite a more rapid
diffusion of oleﬁns. Indeed, the accumulation of the carbon deposit
on the hierarchical zeolites (Fig. 7h) results from a trapping of coke
precursors on the mesopores [39].
Fig. 8 compares the temperature programed reduction (H2-TPR)
proﬁles of the bifunctional catalysts prepared from microporous
and hierarchical zeolites: P, HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH by mechanical
mixing (MM) and ionic exchange (IE). It is worth noting that using
a low heating rate (b = 5 C min1) yields both higher reduction
temperatures (than that reported in the literature) and wide
peaks. On gallium rich-catalyst (5 wt%), prepared by MM, the
TPR proﬁles display one peak at 1006 K that corresponds to the
reduction of Ga2O3 into Ga2O [39] and a second peak at 1020 K
that corresponds to the reduction of Ga2O3 weakly linked to the
zeolite [40]. The TPR peaks on the hierarchical zeolites are identi-
cal regardless of the shape of the mesopores and appears at the
same temperatures with a slightly lower intensity; the difference
could be related to a lower concentration of the exchanged sites,
i.e. the Brønsted acid sites (Table 2). On a gallium poor–catalyst
(0.5 wt%) prepared by ionic exchange, the TPR proﬁles give a broad
peak at high temperature (1105 K) assigned to the reduction of
Ga2O3 and/or gallyl ion (GaO+) in the extraframework positions
into Ga+ [11,13,41] . The reduction temperature shifts by ca
165 K towards a low temperature value in presence of intracrys-
talline mesopores and shifts more toward lower temperature
when these mesopores were structured (- ca 190 K). Hence the
reduction of gallium species is faster and easier after alkaline
treatment, as shown by Al-Yassir et al. [26] and Ogunrounbi
(pre-treatment not speciﬁed) and Al-Yassir et al. [27] (steaming
before reaction) a better mass transport of the gallium species
seems to improve their reducibility.

The dehydrogenation properties of the gallium based catalysts
are characterized by a model reaction: dehydrogenation of cyclo-
hexane (intermediate in the propane reaction of dehydrocycliza-
tion) [42,43]. This test reaction is carried out on a reduced
catalyst at 873 K by using the same reaction temperature as that
of propane transformation and n-hexane cracking, i.e. 803 K.
The contact time of this reaction is two times lower and two
times higher than these of the propane aromatization and n-C6
cracking, respectively. Cyclohexane is dehydrogenated to from
benzene, and after the ring opening, cracks to oleﬁns.
Alkylation reactions occur between oleﬁns and benzene yield-
ing xylenes for example, which in turn disproportionate into
toluene and trimethylbenzene [44]. Regardless of both the gallium

content and the hierarchical character of the zeolite, the cyclohex-
ane transformation yields to dehydrogenated (BTX) and cracking
products which are formed through strictly parallel reactions
(Fig. 9c, d). The cyclohexane dehydrogenation (DH) on zeolite
and Ga2O3when used separately is near zero, and becomes possible
by combining them (Fig. 9b). Therefore, DH requires a ‘‘bi-site” and
the activity depends on both the gallium content and the textural
properties of the microporous H-ZSM-5 (P). Regardless of the
preparation method (MM or IE), the yield in BTX passes through
a maximum at 20% with a gallium content of 2.5 wt%, while on
all the hierarchical zeolites, the BTX yields are much lower
(Fig. 9b). The cracking reaction which proceeds on acid sites
decreases with the increase of gallium content (Fig. 9c), and totally
disappears on the hierarchical zeolites from (5 wt%) and on the
microporous material to reach a plateau at ca. 10% on the Ga + P
series. The proportion of the cracking products is higher on the
hierarchical zeolite series than on the microporous series, inspite
of the lower concentration of the acid sites (Fig. 9d). This means
that DH reaction requires a longer residence time within the crys-
tal than the side reaction, in other words the cracking rate is faster
than the dehydrogenation rate.
The propane aromatization is carried out at 803 K under 1 bar of
propane on the bifunctional catalysts reduced at 873 K. Fig. 10
compares the stability between the acidic zeolites and the bifunc-
tional catalysts. The parent zeolite after a small activation period
deactivates slightly, no activation period and no deactivation
occurs on the hierarchical zeolites. The propane conversion (X) is
similar on all the protonic zeolites. The addition of 5 wt% of Ga
doubles the conversion on the microporous catalysts, with a
slightly higher performance on that prepared by ionic exchange.
On the hierarchical zeolites, regardless of the amount of gallium,
X remains quasi-unchanged, excepted in the case again of catalyst
prepared by IE where it increases slightly (+3%), but much lower on
the microporous catalysts (Fig. 10).
The desilication treatment seems harmful for the propane
aromatization. This is in disagreement with the results obtained
by Al-Yassir et al. [26] and Ogunrounbi et al. [27]. The authors have
shown that the presence of intracristalline ordered mesopores gen-
erated by using the CTAB surfactant with NaOH leads to the
enhancement of the selectivity in aromatics on the galloalumi-
nosilicate [Ga]-Al-MFI (steaming before the reaction) and the
impregnated Ga/H-ZSM-5 (pretreatment not clearly indicated) cat-
alysts, respectively. From the TPR and NMR results, they have
shown that the mesopores improve both the mass transfer of gal-
lium species and therefore provoke higher dispersion, and as a con-
sequence a better aromatics yield.
Fig. 11 displays from (a) to (f) the molar yields into hydrogen,
methane, parafﬁn (P2-7), oleﬁns (O2-8), aromatics (O6-9), and weight
carbon content, respectively as a function of conversion (A) and
gallium content (B). The evolution of product yields with propane
conversion (A) shows that on the desilicated and microporous
materials, the same mechanism occurs. H2, CH4 and oleﬁns are
primary
products,
O6-9
products
transform
through
oligomerization-cyclisation-hybrid
transfer
into
parafﬁn
and
aromatics (secondary products). Regardless of the zeolites used
(P, HNaOH and HNaOH+TBAOH) and the preparation methods (IE or
MM), the presence of gallium has no effect on the oleﬁn yield
(Fig. 11Bd). The addition of a low gallium content, up to 1 wt%
on the desilicated zeolite, increases the yields of H2, P2-7 and
O6-9. The lower yield in CH4 on desilicated catalysts indicates that
the decomposition of propyl-gallium species [25] into propene is
easier than cracking into ethylene and methane. Beyond 1%, a
further addition of gallium has no impact on the performances of
the hierarchical zeolites; the yields into hydrogen, methane, paraf-
ﬁn (P2-7), oleﬁns (O2-8), and aromatics (O6-9) remain constant.
The content of coke (non-desorbed products) increases with
gallium content, and their formation is faster on the catalysts pre-
pared by ionic exchange than by mechanical mixing; surprisingly
the textural properties of the catalyst has only a low impact on
the coke deposition. Indeed, coke appears more at lower conver-
sion on the IE catalysts series than on MM series. As its content
appears to be independent of the presence of mesopores, this
implies that the carbonaceous compounds are deposited only
within the zeolite micropores. The possibility of coke retention
precursors on silanol groups present in mesopores [45] seems lim-
ited probably due the high reaction temperature. There is an
exception with the gallium rich catalysts prepared by mechanical
mixture (5%Ga + HNaoH and 5%Ga + HNaOH+TBAOH) since the coke
content is rather high with respect to the conversion. This means
that one part of the coke molecules is retained within the meso-
pores not chemically but sterically: gallium oxide occluded in
mesopores could reduce the mesopore size aperture that would
prevent the desorption of coke precursors.
The presence of mesopores promotes the mass transfer of gal-
lium species during the ionic exchange (Figs. 5 and 6), their
reducibility (Fig. 8) and the diffusion of reactants, despite that
the desilication is negative on both dehydrogenation of cyclohex-
ane (Fig. 9) and propane aromatization (Fig. 11). The limitation
step of this reaction is the dehydrogenation of propane, and
requires a high residence time inside the zeolite crystals. The initial
activities of propane aromatization (AAR) are proportional to these
of dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (AD) (Fig. 12). Taking into con-
sideration only this result, means that the active site is equivalent
to the dehydrogenating function, which is wrong. Van Santen et al
have conﬁrmed by modeling calculation the mechanism that the
alkane activation on Ga/HZSM-5 occurs by an alkyl mechanism
and requires the concomitant participation of the zeolite oxygen
(Lewis base) together with the gallium atom (Lewis Acid), and this
active center is called ‘‘bi-site” (Scheme 1) [25].
Recently, Schreiber et al [36], proposed that the active sites for
propane dehydrogenation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 with a Si/Al ratio of 50 is
a Lewis-Brønsted acid pairs (scheme 2).
Fig. 13 shows AAr as a function of the balance ratio (AD/Ac) of
dehydrogenating properties and acidic properties (a test), (note
that the activities were measured at the same temperature of that
of propane aromatization). Regardless of the preparation method
and hierarchical character of the zeolite, Aar is proportional to
the balance ratio AD/Ac. The continuous increase of the aromati-
zation activity with the balance ratio AD/Ac shows that the limit-
ing step is the dehydrogenation of propane.

We suggest that the dehydrogenation of the light alkanes
requires ‘‘strong” LAS. On the hierarchical bifunctional catalysts
which have only ‘‘weak” Lewis acid sites (Fig. SI.1), the dehydro-
genation activity is low, while on bifunctional microporous cata-
lysts LAS generated by the Ga species are slightly ‘‘stronger”,
which coincides with a higher dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 9b)
4. Conclusion
The desilication of H-ZSM-5 zeolite leads to the formation of
intracristalline mesopores, more or less structured, upon the alka-
line treatment. The presence of TBAOH allows shaping the meso-
pores. The alkaline treatment preserves the majority of the
Brønsted acid sites without any change of their strength. A low
amount of new type of Lewis acid sites appears, more particularly
in presence of TBAOH.
Upon the preparation of the bifunctional catalyst by ionic
exchange, the presence of intracrystalline mesopores allows a dif-
fusion of the hydrated gallium cation up to the core of the crystal,
while on a microporous zeolite [Ga(H2O)6]3+ accumulates on the
crystal surface.
Regardless of the initial gallium location, the solid ionic
exchange proceeds during reduction treatment, if the gallium con-
tent is enough, up to a complete exchange with the zeolite protonic
sites; the reduction time, relatively long (10 h) in this study do not
allow estimating the potential gain of the used of hierarchical zeo-
lite on the ionic exchange.
The cracking activity of n-hexane (a test) is proportional to the
concentration of the protonic sites probed by the pyridine on the
calcined catalysts and not on the reduced ones; the catalysts recov-
ered their intrinsic acidic properties which indicates the instability
of the gallium hydride species in presence of hydrocarbons. The
presence of mesopores reduces the residence time of oleﬁns within
the zeolite crystal that mitigates the hydride transfer. A shorter
residence time of parafﬁn and the weak acid Lewis sites of gallium
created after desilication in comparison with that created on the
microporous zeolite, inhibit drastically the dehydrogenation activ-
ity of the catalyst as well as the propane dehydrocyclisation reac-
tion since the kinetic limiting step of the reaction is the propane
dehydrogenation. The presence of mesopores bears no gain on
the coke deposition, the coke continues to be located on the zeolite
micropores; but with gallium rich catalyst a steric retention of the
coke precursors appears in the mesopores.

In conclusion, the hierarchization of zeolite is negative for the
propane aromatization.
