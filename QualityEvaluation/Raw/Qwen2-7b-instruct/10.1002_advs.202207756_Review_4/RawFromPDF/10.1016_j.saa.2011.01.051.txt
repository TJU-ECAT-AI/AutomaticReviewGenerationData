Autoclaving was used to manipulate nutrient utilization and availability. The objectives of this study were
to characterize any changes of the functional groups mainly associated with lipid structure in ﬂaxseed
(Linum usitatissimum, cv. Vimy), that occurred on a molecular level during the treatment process using
infrared Fourier transform molecular spectroscopy. The parameters included lipid CH3 asymmetric (ca.
2959 cm−1), CH2 asymmetric (ca. 2928 cm−1), CH3 symmetric (ca. 2871 cm−1) and CH2 symmetric (ca.
2954 cm−1) functional groups, lipid carbonyl C
O ester group (ca. 1745 cm−1), lipid unsaturation group
(CH attached to C
C) (ca. 3010 cm−1) as well as their ratios. Hierarchical cluster analysis (CLA) and
principal components analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify molecular spectral differences. Flaxseed
samples were kept raw for the control or autoclaved in batches at 120 ◦C for 20, 40 or 60 min for treatments
1, 2 and 3, respectively. Molecular spectral analysis of lipid functional group ratios showed a signiﬁcant
decrease (P < 0.05) in the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric stretching band peak intensity ratios for
the ﬂaxseed. There were linear and quadratic effects (P < 0.05) of the treatment time from 0, 20, 40 and
60 min on the ratios of the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric stretching vibration intensity. Autoclav-
ing had no signiﬁcant effect (P > 0.05) on lipid carbonyl C
O ester group and lipid unsaturation group
(CH attached to C
C) (with average spectral peak area intensities of 138.3 and 68.8 IR intensity units,
respectively). Multivariate molecular spectral analyses, CLA and PCA, were unable to make distinctions
between the different treatment original spectra at the CH3 and CH2 asymmetric and symmetric region
(ca. 2988–2790 cm−1). The results indicated that autoclaving had an impact to the mid-infrared molecu-
lar spectrum of ﬂaxseed to identify heat-induced changes in lipid conformation. A future study is needed
to quantify the relationship between lipid molecular structure changes and functionality/availability.

1. Introduction
Autoclaving, one of heating methods, is used to manipulate
nutrient utilization and availability [1] in plant-based food and
feeds. A published study [1] showed that using an autoclave could
modify protein degradability and digestibility in ﬂaxseed. The
autoclaving increased total intestinal protein supply (DVE value)
and decreased rumen bypass protein (BCP) and degraded pro-
tein balance (OEB value) [1]. This was mainly because autoclaving
shifted the protein digestion from rumen to small intestines. Doiron
et al. [2] showed that autoclaving changed protein subfraction
and protein molecular structure proﬁle and it decreased protein
secondary structure -helix to -sheet ratio in the ﬂaxseed. The
protein - helix to -sheet ratio had a signiﬁcantly positive cor-

value and a negative correlation with degraded protein balance
[1].
To date, there is no study on heat-induced changes in lipid
structural proﬁle. The diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier trans-
form molecular spectroscopy is able to detect molecular structural
features in complex plant/seed/feed/food systems [3–5]. This
molecular spectroscopy technique plus multivariate molecular
spectral analyses are capable to distinguish the structural differ-
ences on a molecular basis between the treatments and different
cereal seed varieties [6].
The objectives of this study were to characterize any changes
of the functional groups mainly associated with lipid biopoly-
mer in ﬂaxseed (Linum usitatissimum, cv. Vimy), that occurred
on a molecular level during the treatment process using molec-
ular spectroscopy. The parameters that we investigated were

The goal of this study was to attempt to understand and iden-
tify spectroscopic signatures that are associated with changes in
lipid biopolymer in complex plant systems. The hypothesis of this
study was that autoclave-induced spectroscopic changes to the
ﬂaxseed lipid associated spectra could be detected with molecular
spectroscopy.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Flaxseed samples and ﬂaxseed heating
Flaxseed (L. usitatissimum) (cv. Vimy) grown near Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan was provided by Shamrock Seeds Ltd. (Saskatoon,
Saskatchewan). Flaxseed were heated by autoclave (Amsco Eagle
SG-3031, STERIS Corporation) in an autoclave tray at temperature
100 ◦C for 20, 40 and 60 min as treatment 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

spectrum of asymmetric and symmetric C–H (CH2 and CH3) stretching region with four multi-component peaks at ca. 2959, 2928, 2871, and 2854 cm−1.
Control treatments were kept raw. For detailed report on the effect
of autoclaving on detailed chemical and nutrient proﬁles, please
read the publication by Doiron et al. [1].
2.2. Flaxseed processing
Brieﬂy, cooled ﬂaxseed samples were ground in a coffee grinder
(Braun KSM 2), chilled again and re-ground. Grinding was done for
3 min each time. The cooling was done so as to prevent the sam-
ples from forming dough and from getting too warm, thus creating
artefacts in the spectra. The coffee grinder was selected to mini-
mize the effects of grinding on the ﬂaxseed spectra ensuring the
physical cracking and breaking of the sample yet maintaining as
much of the smaller plant seed structures and molecular bonds as
possible [2].
2.3. Diffuse reﬂectance Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy
The detailed procedure was reported in Dorion [7]. Brieﬂy,
samples of the ﬁnely ground ﬂaxseed were mixed with KBr (IR
grade, Sigma) and mixed by vortex for several min. Molecular spec-
troscopy was performed using a Bio-Rad FTS-40 with a ceramic IR
source and MCT detector (Bio-Rad laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Data were collected using Win-IR software. Spectra were generated
from the mid-IR (4000–400 cm−1) portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum with 256 co-added scans and a spectral resolution of
4 cm−1. The detailed collection procedure was described in Doiron
[7]. Spectral analysis was done with OMNIC 7.2 (Spectra Tech) soft-
ware. Fig. 1a shows a typical molecular spectrum in ﬂaxseed tissue
(raw, ﬁnely ground) in the region ca. 4000–400 cm−1.
2.4. Spectral functional group ratio measurement
The functional groups that are mainly associated with lipid
biopolymer in ﬂaxseed (L. usitatissimum, cv. Vimy), include CH3
asymmetric (ca. 2959 cm−1), CH2 asymmetric (ca. 2928 cm−1), CH3
symmetric (ca. 2871 cm−1) and CH2 symmetric (ca. 2954 cm−1)
functional groups, carbonyl C O ester group (ca. 1745 cm−1), lipid
unsaturation group (CH attached to C C) (ca. 3010 cm−1).
The CH2 and CH3 asymmetric and symmetric stretching func-
tional group band in a typical molecular spectrum in ﬂaxseed
located in the region of ca. 2990–2800 cm−1 (Fig. 1b). Two different
methods were used to identify component bands for the spectra. In
the ﬁrst method, the component peaks and frequencies that com-
prise the CH2 and CH3 asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands
in the CH region were identiﬁed using the 2nd derivative function
in OMNIC 7.2 [Fig. 2a and b]. In the second method, the spectra were
ﬁrst converted by Fourier self-deconvolution (FSD) with OMNIC 7.2
(Spectra Tech., USA) to identify the component peaks and frequen-
cies that comprise the CH2 and CH3 asymmetric and symmetric
stretching band [Fig. 2c and d]. Then the spectral intensities (peak
area and height) of the component bands representing CH2 and
CH3 asymmetric and symmetric stretching functional group bands
in the original spectra were calculated as shown in Fig. 3.
2.5. Multivariate molecular spectral analyses
Two multivariate molecular spectral analyses, hierarchical clus-
ter analysis (CLA) and principal components analysis (PCA), were
used to compare the spectra of the different treatments to the
control samples to determine if there were some underlying struc-
tural differences in the spectral information that would permit the
identiﬁcation of spectra belonging to different treatment groups.
The detailed principals, cluster and component calculations were
reported in Yu [3]. For CLA and PCA the spectral region of ca.
2988–2790 cm−1, containing CH2 and CH3 asymmetric and asym-
metric stretching bands was used. CLA results were presented as
dendograms while PCA results were plotted based on the two high-
est factor scores and plotted as a function of those scores. In each
comparison the eigenvector for factor 1 was plotted against that for
factor 2 which accounted for over 99% of the variability in the data.
2.6. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses of the functional groups spectral intensities
and ratios were performed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (ver-
sion 9.1.3). The model used for the analysis was: Yij =  + Ti + eij,
where, Yij was an observation of the dependent variable ij;  was
the population mean for the variable; Ti was the effect of the heating
treatments, as a ﬁxed effect, and eij was the random error associated
with the observation ij.

obtained from Steel and Torrie [8].

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Detect spectral proﬁle changes in asymmetric and symmetric
CH3 and CH2 stretching vibration intensity
Typical molecular spectrum in ﬂaxseed tissue (Fig. 1a) in the
region ca. 4000–400 cm−1 shows chemical function groups in com-
plex plant systems: N–H & O–H stretch, C–H stretch, amides I and II,
C O carbonyl ester, CHO and cellulosic compounds, etc. Within the
region of around 3000–2800 cm−1, the dominant mid-IR absorption
features are assigned, predominantly to asymmetric and symmet-
ric stretching vibrations of CH3 (ca. 2959 and 2871 cm−1) and CH2
(ca. 2928 and 2854 cm−1) groups of acyl chains (Fig. 1b) [9–15].
Table 1 shows the absorbed peak area and height intensities
of each CH functional group: CH3-asymmetric (ca. 2959 cm−1),
CH2-asymmetric (ca. 2928 cm−1), CH3-symmetric (ca. 2871 cm−1),
and CH2-symmetric (ca. 2854 cm−1) stretching vibrations resulting
from scanning the raw and autoclaved ﬂaxseed. The wavenum-
bers for the above CH functional groups for ﬂaxseed are similar
to published values reported from Wetzel and LeVine [13], Jack-
son and Mantsch [10] and Yu et al. [15]. The only CH3 symmetric
stretching vibration in the ﬂaxseed was very weak (Fig. 1b). This
is quite different from canola seed spectral proﬁle in this region
[15]. By visual observation, all autoclaved treatments did not show
a dramatic change spectral pattern (Fig. 4).
The peak area and height intensities of CH3-asymmetric, CH2-
asymmetric, CH3-symmetric, CH2-symmetric vibrations were 96,
280, 34 and 119; 3.6, 5.4, 2.7 and 4.1 for the raw ﬂaxseed,
respectively (Table 1). This spectral proﬁle of the asymmetric and
symmetric stretching vibration intensity of CH3 and CH2 are differ-
ent from Canola seed [15].
Based on the data from each treatment (raw vs. 120 ◦C/20 min
vs. 120 ◦C/40 min vs. 120 ◦C/60 min), no differences were found
between the treatments, indicating the heating did not affect vibra-
tion intensities of the asymmetric and symmetric CH3 and CH2
functional groups. Doiron et al. [1] reported that autoclaving signif-
icantly changed protein secondary structure proﬁles. These results
indicate that the autoclaving had a different impact on different
molecular species. Some molecular species are very sensitive to
heating and some are not.
3.2. Ratios of the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric stretching
vibration intensity
Table 2 shows the peak area and height ratios of CH func-
tional groups in the raw and autoclaved ﬂaxseed at 120 ◦C for
20 min, 40 min and 60 min: ratio of CH2 asymmetric: CH3 asym-
metric stretching vibrations. The peak area and height ratios of
CH2-asymmetric to CH3-asymmetric was 2.96 and 1.53, respec-
tively for the raw ﬂaxseed (Table 2).
The spectral analysis of CH functional group ratios showed a
signiﬁcant decrease (P < 0.05) in the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asym-
metric stretching vibration peak intensity ratios (both area and
height) after the autoclaving (Table 2). There were linear and
quadratic effects (P < 0.05) of the treatment time from 0, 20, 40 and
60 min on the ratios of the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric

stretching vibration intensity. Based on the data from each treat-
ment, autoclaving decreased the spectral ratios of CH2 asymmetric
to CH2 asymmetric vibration intensity, indicating the structural dif-
ference in lipid CH3 to CH2 ratios between the raw and treatment,
which indicates that heating might affect lipid chain length and
branching.
Normally, we do not analyse asymmetric to symmetric C-H
bands ratio in one function group. Asymmetric to symmetric C–H
bands ratio in one molecular function group (for example CH3 or
CH2) should remain constant. Sometimes the intensity ratio of the
asymmetric and symmetric C–H bands of either CH2 or CH3 groups
varies little with sample treatment. This could be explained. The
C–H stretching bands are superimposed on the O–H stretch of OH
groups. Since the absorption by the OH stretching band is greater at
higher frequency (3000 cm−1) than lower frequency (2800 cm−1),
the penetration of the beam can be less for the asymmetric C–H
stretching bands than the symmetric C–H stretching bands [16,17].
This goes some way towards explaining why the intensity ratio
of the asymmetric and symmetric C–H bands varies with sample
treatment.
3.3. Detect spectral proﬁle changes in carbonyl C O ester group
and lipid unsaturation group (CH attached to C C) in lipid
biopolymer
The characteristics of lipid chain length, branching and unsatu-
ration are usually inferred by comparing contributions of carbonyl
ester C O, CH3, CH2, and CH–C C absorptions [13]. The small
band at ca. 3010 cm−1 indicates the presence of unsaturation (CH
attached to C C) in the ﬂaxseed [11] (Fig. 1b). In addition, a strong
band in the region of ca. 1800–1500 cm−1 at ca. 1745 cm−1 arises
mainly from stretching vibration of the carbonyl ester C O bond
in lipids [11,14]. All these bands have been used to indicate main
lipid structure characteristics.
Table 3 shows the peak area and height ratios of lipid carbonyl
C O ester group and lipid unsaturation group (CH attached to C C)
in the raw and autoclaved ﬂaxseed at 120 ◦C for 20, 40 and 60 min.
The peak area and height of the unsaturation group (CH–C C) at
ca. 3010 cm−1 were 62 and 2.4 for the raw ﬂaxseed, respectively
(Table 3). The peak area and height for lipid carbonyl C O ester
group at ca. 1745 cm−1 were 131 and 5.2 for the raw ﬂaxseed,
respectively (Table 3). These data were different from the yellow
and brown-seeded canola [15]. The autoclaving treatment at 120 ◦C
for different times (20, 40, and 60 min) did not change the spec-
tral intensities of carbonyl C O ester group and lipid unsaturation
group (CH–C C) in lipid of ﬂaxseed.
3.4. Multivariate molecular spectral analyses
The multivariate analyses, CLA and PCA, were subsequently con-
ducted on the deﬁned region of the spectrum, in this case the
spectrum from ca. 2988–2790 cm−1 which covered both the promi-
nent and mainly lipid related asymmetric and symmetric CH3 and
CH2 bands. For multivariate analyses, very little modiﬁcation of the
spectra and thus very little time is required for this analysis [2]. The
beneﬁt of cluster analysis is that no other prior knowledge of the
sample other than a mid-IR spectrum is required to make a possi-
ble distinction [2]. The implications of this are that with a pool of
spectra we would only need to add an unknown spectrum of inter-
est to the cluster analysis procedure to discover if the sample has
been autoclaved or not, provided all other things remain equal such
as sample preparation for example [2]. The multivariate molecular
analysis and their applications in plan-based feed structure were
reviewed by Yu [3].
Fig. 5 showed the results of the multivariate molecular spec-
tral analyses of the asymmetric and symmetric CH2 and CH3 on a
molecular basis among the raw and autoclaved ﬂaxseed (0 = raw
vs. 1 = 120 ◦C/20 min vs. 2 = 120 ◦C/40 min vs. 3 = 120 ◦C/20 min) for
the ca. 2988–2790 cm−1 spectral region. The CLA analysis (Fig. 5a)
shows that all clusters contain combinations of spectra from the
other treatments, and no unique or distinct cluster could be formed
for each treatment. This implies that cluster analysis was unable to
distinguish autoclaved ﬂaxseed samples from the raw samples and
between the treatments. The CLA comparisons failed to demon-
strate any distinct groupings among all the treatments.
Further PCA spectral comparisons are shown in Fig. 5b. The
results are similar to those with CLA analysis. The spectral compar-
isons by PCA were not able to show any clear group of the spectra on
the factor plane among the raw and the autoclaved ﬂaxseed (0 = raw
vs. 1 = 120 ◦C/20 min vs. 2 = 120 ◦C/40 min vs. 3 = 120 ◦C/20 min) for
the ca. 2988–2790 cm−1 spectral region. These results indicated
that the autoclaved treatment spectra did not dramatically differ
from the raw spectra and suggested that either there was no dra-
matic structural change based on the asymmetric and symmetric
CH3 and CH2 bands regions, or the PCA analysis is unable to detect
the subtle heat-induced changes in lipid conformation as shown in
Table 2.
A previous study [2] shows that the CLA and PCA were success-
fully used to make distinctions between the different treatment
spectra and showed enhanced sensitivity upon selection of a
smaller spectral window to include the amide I and II portion of the
IR spectrum. The results indicated that autoclaving had an effect to
the mid-IR spectrum of ﬂaxseed to identify the altered -helix to
-sheet ratio and subsequently differentiated between the treat-
ments using PCA and CLA suggesting greater sensitivity of mid-IR
spectral methods in identifying the treatments [2].
The previous and current study results indicated that different
functional groups in ﬂaxseed have signiﬁcantly different sensi-
tivity to the heating. Protein molecular structures in ﬂaxseed are
more sensitive to the heating which results in molecular structure
changes. These structural changes were enough to be picked up by
the CLA and PCA molecular spectral analyses. However, the lipid
functional groups, particularly carbonyl C O ester group and lipid
unsaturation group (CH attached to C C) show less sensitivity to
the heating than protein secondary structure.
4. Conclusions and implications
Autoclaving under the current conditions at 120 ◦C for 20, 40 and
60 min had no signiﬁcant effect on spectral intensities of the car-
bonyl C O ester group and lipid unsaturation group (CH attached
to C C) with average spectral peak area intensities of 138 and
69 IR intensity units, respectively. However, the autoclaving had
signiﬁcantly changed the ratio proﬁles of the CH2 asymmetric to
CH3 asymmetric stretching band vibration intensity. Multivariate
molecular spectral analyses, CLA and PCA, were unable to make
distinctions between the different treatments in original spec-
tra at the asymmetric and symmetric CH3 and CH2 region (ca.
2988–2790 cm−1). The results indicated that the autoclaving had
an impact to the mid-IR spectrum of ﬂaxseed to identify heat-
induced changes in lipid conformation. A future study is needed
to quantify the relationship between lipid structure changes and
functionality/availability.
