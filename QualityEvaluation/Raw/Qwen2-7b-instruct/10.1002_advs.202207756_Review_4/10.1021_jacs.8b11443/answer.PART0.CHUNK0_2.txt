The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane molecules activate on the surface of Ga/H-MFI catalysts, leading to the initiation of the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism includes the formation of an alkyl radical from propane, followed by hydrogen abstraction to yield propylene. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate that further reacts to produce propylene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step due to its high activation energy barrier compared to the alkyl abstraction step. This mechanism is applicable to both monogallium and polygallium species, demonstrating similar reactivity patterns across different gallium structures.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷分子在Ga/H-MFI催化剂表面上活化，从而启动脱氢过程。该机制包括从丙烷形成烷基自由基，随后通过氢解离产生丙烯。这与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及形成碳正离子中间体，进一步反应产生丙烯。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤，因为其激活能量壁垒高于烷基解离步骤。这一机制适用于单镓和多镓物种，显示出相似的活性模式，跨越不同的镓结构。
