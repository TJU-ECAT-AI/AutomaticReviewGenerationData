The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The rate-determining step (RDS) is considered to be the activation of the primary carbon-hydrogen bond, which is energetically more demanding compared to the activation of an alkyl group. This indicates that the alkyl mechanism is preferred for PDH reactions on gallium catalysts. Different gallium species, including those prepared through vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI zeolites with GaCl3, influence the catalytic activity. These catalysts also facilitate propane cracking processes.

烷基化机制在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及到丙烷的活化，随后形成一个碳正离子中间体。速率决定步骤（RDS）被提议是主碳-氢键的活化，这在能量上比活化烷基组更加困难。这表明，在镓催化剂上，烷基机制更适合PDH反应。不同的镓物种，如通过GaCl3蒸汽相交换H-MFI沸石制备的，会影响催化活性。这些催化剂还促进了丙烷裂解过程。
