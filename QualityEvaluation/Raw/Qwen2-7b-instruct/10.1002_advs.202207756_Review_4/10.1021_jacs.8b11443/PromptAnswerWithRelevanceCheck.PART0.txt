The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds from initial propane activation to product formation. It is characterized by the activation of the CH group, which is considered the rate-determining step (RDS). This mechanism is versatile and can apply to various structures of gallium species used as catalysts.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane molecules activate on the surface of Ga/H-MFI catalysts, leading to the initiation of the dehydrogenation process. The mechanism includes the formation of an alkyl radical from propane, followed by hydrogen abstraction to yield propylene. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate that further reacts to produce propylene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step due to its high activation energy barrier compared to the alkyl abstraction step. This mechanism is applicable to both monogallium and polygallium species, demonstrating similar reactivity patterns across different gallium structures.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷分子在Ga/H-MFI催化剂表面上活化，从而启动脱氢过程。该机制包括从丙烷形成烷基自由基，随后通过氢解离产生丙烯。这与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及形成碳正离子中间体，进一步反应产生丙烯。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤，因为其激活能量壁垒高于烷基解离步骤。这一机制适用于单镓和多镓物种，显示出相似的活性模式，跨越不同的镓结构。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, leading to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The rate-determining step (RDS) is considered to be the activation of the primary carbon-hydrogen bond, which is energetically more demanding compared to the activation of an alkyl group. This indicates that the alkyl mechanism is preferred for PDH reactions on gallium catalysts. Different gallium species, including those prepared through vapor-phase exchange of H-MFI zeolites with GaCl3, influence the catalytic activity. These catalysts also facilitate propane cracking processes.

烷基化机制在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）涉及到丙烷的活化，随后形成一个碳正离子中间体。速率决定步骤（RDS）被提议是主碳-氢键的活化，这在能量上比活化烷基组更加困难。这表明，在镓催化剂上，烷基机制更适合PDH反应。不同的镓物种，如通过GaCl3蒸汽相交换H-MFI沸石制备的，会影响催化活性。这些催化剂还促进了丙烷裂解过程。
