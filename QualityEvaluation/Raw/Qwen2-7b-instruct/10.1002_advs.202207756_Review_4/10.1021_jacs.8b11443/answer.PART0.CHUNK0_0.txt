The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the breaking of carbon-carbon bonds from initial propane activation to product formation. It is characterized by the activation of the CH group, which is considered the rate-determining step (RDS). This mechanism is versatile and can apply to various structures of gallium species used as catalysts.
