The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, which leads to the formation of an alkyl cation. This process is characterized by the cleavage of C-H bonds, resulting in the production of ethylene and hydrogen. The activation of the propane molecule involves the breaking of the C-H bonds, leading to the formation of an alkyl cation. The key steps in this mechanism are the initial activation of propane, followed by the formation of an alkyl cation, and finally the cleavage of the alkyl cation to form ethylene and hydrogen. The CH activation step is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) because of the high energy barrier associated with the breaking of the C-H bond. This mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, with the specific structure affecting the reaction rates and product selectivities.
