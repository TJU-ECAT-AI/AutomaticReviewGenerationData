[1] "In this paper, we attempt to correlate quantitative in situ XANES and EXAFS results on Ga-HZSM5 catalysts in different states of reduction, in order to obtain data on the structure of reduced gallium species under propane aromatization conditions."
[2] "The results showed that the reduction proceeds from Ga3+ binuclear species 4-fold coordinated to oxygen to an isolated Ga+ ion coordinated to a single oxygen atom."
[3] "The fact that a linear correlation was found between the gallium second sphere coordination number and the Ga3+ content of all partially reduced catalyst, which extrapolates to a coordination number of 1 for 100% Ga3+, strongly suggests that, at the early stages of the reduction, more condensed oxidic gallium species present in the completely oxidized catalysts are converted to binuclear species."
[4] "Perhaps on account of that fact, the charged species are more easily reduced than the neutral ones."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane molecules, leading to the formation of alkyl radicals. These radicals undergo further reactions, such as hydrogen shift, cyclization, and elimination of hydrogen to form olefinic products. The key steps in this mechanism include the initial activation of propane by the gallium species on the catalyst surface, followed by the formation of alkyl radicals. The proposed carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it is the slowest step in the mechanism. This step is facilitated by the gallium species, which provides a suitable environment for the activation of propane. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including binuclear and tetranuclear species, which are involved in the reduction and deactivation processes of the catalyst.

[1] "In situ gallium K edge XAFS spectroscopy experiments were performed with GaZSM5 catalysts containing two different gallium loadings (2 and 4%) under hydrogen or propane in the 703823K temperature range."
[2] "It was found that, irrespective of the gallium loading and reducing gas, linear correlations were found between the coordination numbers of both the first (GaO scattering legs) and second (GaGa scattering legs) gallium coordination spheres estimated from EXAFS and the degree of reduction estimated by XANES."
[3] "The results showed that the reduction proceeds from Ga3+ binuclear species 4-fold coordinated to oxygen to an isolated Ga+ ion coordinated to a single oxygen atom."
[4] "In catalyst T4GaZ35 in its oxidized form the second sphere coordination number is close to 1.0, as apparent from Figure 6, so this catalyst is probably rich in binuclear oxidic gallium species."
[5] "It was found that strong Lewis acid sites are generated upon evacuation at 673 K."
[6] "Since, as already mentioned, the X-ray absorption spectra of fully oxidized catalysts were obtained with atmosphere-equilibrated samples, it is likely that the gallium species in these samples are hydrated or hydroxylated."
[7] "Upon evacuation at 673 K, the gallium species in the atmosphere-equilibrated catalyst are likely to be dehydrated to produce coordinatively unsaturated gallium ions responsible for the Lewis acidity."
[8] "Reactions 57 may also involve propane instead of hydrogen, producing propene in addition to water."
[9] "It is observed from Figures 5 and 6 and Table 1 that, even by heating at 873 K, a significant portion of the gallium is not reduced."

### Explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane molecules to form alkyl radicals. These alkyl radicals then undergo further reactions to form various hydrocarbons, including propene and other alkenes. The key steps of this mechanism are:

1. **Initial Propane Activation**: Propane molecules are activated by the gallium-based catalysts. This activation involves breaking the C-C bonds in propane, which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS).

2. **Formation of Alkyl Radicals**: Once activated, propane molecules generate alkyl radicals. These radicals are crucial intermediates in the PDH reaction.

3. **Product Formation**: The alkyl radicals then react with each other or with other molecules (such as hydrogen or propane) to form various hydrocarbons. This includes the formation of propene, which is the primary product of interest in PDH reactions.

### Comparison with the Carbenium Mechanism

The carbenium mechanism typically describes reactions involving carbocations, which are positively charged species derived from the loss of a hydrogen atom from a saturated hydrocarbon. While both mechanisms involve the activation of hydrocarbons and the generation of reactive intermediates, the alkyl mechanism focuses specifically on the formation of alkyl radicals, whereas the carbenium mechanism deals with carbocations. The alkyl mechanism is more directly applicable to PDH reactions, where the goal is to break C-C bonds in propane to form alkenes.

### Why CH Activation Step is Proposed as the RDS

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it is the most energetically demanding and thermodynamically unfavorable step in the reaction sequence. Breaking the C-C bonds in propane to form alkyl radicals requires a significant amount of energy, making this step the bottleneck in the overall reaction pathway. The efficiency of the catalyst in facilitating this step directly influences the overall rate of PDH reactions.

### Application to Different Ga Species Structures

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the unique properties of gallium-based catalysts. The gallium atoms, often present in binuclear species, facilitate the activation of propane molecules by providing suitable binding sites for the propane molecules. The coordination number of gallium species, as shown in the literature, affects the stability and reactivity of these species, influencing the efficiency of the alkyl mechanism. The linear correlation between the coordination numbers of gallium species and the degree of reduction indicates that the structure of gallium species plays a crucial role in the PDH reaction mechanism.

### Conclusion

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane to form alkyl radicals, which then undergo further reactions to produce hydrocarbons. The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step due to its high energy demand. The structure and coordination of gallium species on the catalyst surface are critical factors that influence the efficiency of this mechanism. The understanding of this mechanism provides insights into optimizing gallium-based catalysts for PDH applications.

### 丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中镓基催化剂上的烷基机制的解释

丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷分子的活化，形成烷基自由基。这些烷基自由基随后进行进一步反应形成各种烃类，包括丙烯和其他烯烃。机制的关键步骤如下：

1. **初始丙烷活化**：丙烷分子通过镓基催化剂活化。这个活化过程涉及到破坏丙烷分子中的C-C键，这被提议为决定性步骤（RDS）。

2. **形成烷基自由基**：活化的丙烷分子生成烷基自由基。这些自由基是PDH反应中的关键中间体。

3. **产物形成**：烷基自由基然后与其他分子（如氢或丙烷）反应，形成各种烃类。这包括形成丙烯，这是PDH反应的主要目标产品。

### 与卡本亚机制的比较

卡本亚机制通常描述涉及碳正离子的反应，这些碳正离子是由饱和烃失去一个氢原子而形成的。尽管这两种机制都涉及烃类的活化和活性中间体的形成，但烷基机制专注于形成烷基自由基，而卡本亚机制则处理碳正离子。烷基机制更适合直接应用于PDH反应，其目标是破坏丙烷中的C-C键以形成烯烃。

### 为什么CH活化步骤被认为是RDS

CH活化步骤被认为是PDH反应的决定性步骤，因为它是最耗能且热力学上最不利的步骤在反应序列中。破坏丙烷中的C-C键以形成烷基自由基需要大量的能量，因此这是整体反应途径的瓶颈。催化剂在促进此步骤的效率直接影响PDH反应的整体速率。

### 不同Ga物种结构的应用

烷基机制适用于不同Ga物种结构，通过利用镓基催化剂的独特性质。镓原子，常以二核物种形式存在，通过提供适当的结合位点来促进丙烷分子的活化。镓物种的协调数，如文献所示，影响这些物种的稳定性和反应性，从而影响烷基机制的效率。镓物种结构与PDH反应机制之间的线性相关性表明，镓物种结构在PDH反应机制中起着关键作用。

### 结论

镓基催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应中的烷基机制涉及丙烷的活化以形成烷基自由基，随后进行进一步反应形成烃类。CH活化步骤被认为是最关键的步骤，因为它的能量需求非常高。镓物种的结构和协调对催化剂表面的效率有重要影响。对这种机制的理解为优化镓基催化剂提供了洞察，用于PDH应用。

Answer: The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane molecules are activated by the gallium species on the catalyst surface. This activation typically involves the breaking of a C-H bond in the propane molecule, creating an alkyl radical. Subsequently, the alkyl radical undergoes a series of reactions, including isomerization and dehydrogenation, to form a variety of products such as propene, propylene, and benzene. The specific sequence of reactions can vary depending on the structure of the gallium species involved.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is characterized by the formation and subsequent manipulation of alkyl radicals rather than carbenium ions. The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion, which then undergoes a series of reactions, often including nucleophilic attack and elimination, to produce the final products. The carbenium mechanism is typically associated with metal carbene complexes, whereas the alkyl mechanism is more commonly observed in the context of metal catalysts that promote alkyl radical formation.

The activation of propane is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is because the efficiency of this step determines the overall speed of the PDH reaction. The nature of the gallium species plays a crucial role in the activation of propane. For instance, gallium species with higher Lewis acidity can facilitate the activation of propane more effectively, potentially leading to faster PDH rates.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various gallium species structures. Binuclear gallium species, for example, are rich in oxidic gallium species in their oxidized form, as evidenced by the coordination number being close to 1.0. These species are believed to be responsible for the activation of propane, possibly through the formation of alkyl radicals. Neutral binuclear gallium species, with lower Lewis acidity, are thought to be less reactive but still participate in the PDH process, albeit with a different kinetic profile compared to their charged counterparts.

Neutral binuclear species, as well as more condensed oxidic gallium species, are subject to decomposition during the reduction process. This decomposition can lead to the formation of volatile Ga2O species, which migrate from the external to the internal surface of zeolites, influencing the overall catalytic performance. The fate of the more condensed oxidic gallium species is less clear but is presumed to involve the formation of hydrated or hydroxylated gallium species that can decompose upon dehydration or react with water, hydrogen, or propane.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation and manipulation of alkyl radicals, with the activation step being rate-determining. Different gallium species structures influence the efficiency of this mechanism, affecting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity of the PDH process.

回答：丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及几个关键步骤。首先，丙烷分子通过催化剂表面的镓物种激活。这一激活通常涉及到丙烷分子中C-H键的断裂，形成烷基自由基。随后，烷基自由基经历一系列反应，包括异构化和脱氢，以形成各种产物，如丙烯、丙二烯和苯。特定的反应序列可能根据所涉及的镓物种结构而有所不同。

与碳烯机制相比，烷基机制的特点是形成并随后操作烷基自由基，而不是碳烯离子。碳烯机制涉及形成碳烯离子，然后进行一系列反应，经常包括亲核攻击和消除，以产生最终产物。碳烯机制通常与金属碳烯复合物相关联，而烷基机制更常在促进烷基自由基形成的金属催化剂中观察到。

丙烷的激活被提议为烷基机制的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为此步骤的效率决定了PDH反应的整体速度。所涉及的镓物种的性质对丙烷的激活起着至关重要的作用。例如，具有较高Lewis酸性的镓物种能够更有效地促进丙烷的激活，可能导致更快的PDH速率。

不同镓物种结构对烷基机制的应用有所不同。二核镓物种在其氧化形式中富含氧化镓物种，如图6所示，其配位数接近1.0。这些物种被认为负责丙烷的激活，可能通过形成烷基自由基。带电较低的二核镓物种被认为是较不活泼的，但仍然参与PDH过程，与它们的带电对应物相比，其动力学轮廓可能有所不同。

中性二核镓物种以及更为凝聚的氧化镓物种在还原过程中会分解。这种分解可能导致挥发性Ga2O物种的形成，这些物种从外部迁移到沸石内部表面，影响整体催化性能。对于更凝聚的氧化镓物种的命运不太清楚，但推测它们涉及形成带水或羟基的镓物种，这些物种在脱水或与水、氢或丙烷反应时可能分解。

总之，PDH反应中基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及烷基自由基的激活和操作，其中激活步骤是速率决定性的。不同的镓物种结构影响这一机制的效率，影响PDH过程的整体活性和选择性。
