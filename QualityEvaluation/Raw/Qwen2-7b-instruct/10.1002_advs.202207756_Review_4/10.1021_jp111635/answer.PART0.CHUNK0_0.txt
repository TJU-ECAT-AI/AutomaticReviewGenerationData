[1] "In this paper, we attempt to correlate quantitative in situ XANES and EXAFS results on Ga-HZSM5 catalysts in different states of reduction, in order to obtain data on the structure of reduced gallium species under propane aromatization conditions."
[2] "The results showed that the reduction proceeds from Ga3+ binuclear species 4-fold coordinated to oxygen to an isolated Ga+ ion coordinated to a single oxygen atom."
[3] "The fact that a linear correlation was found between the gallium second sphere coordination number and the Ga3+ content of all partially reduced catalyst, which extrapolates to a coordination number of 1 for 100% Ga3+, strongly suggests that, at the early stages of the reduction, more condensed oxidic gallium species present in the completely oxidized catalysts are converted to binuclear species."
[4] "Perhaps on account of that fact, the charged species are more easily reduced than the neutral ones."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane molecules, leading to the formation of alkyl radicals. These radicals undergo further reactions, such as hydrogen shift, cyclization, and elimination of hydrogen to form olefinic products. The key steps in this mechanism include the initial activation of propane by the gallium species on the catalyst surface, followed by the formation of alkyl radicals. The proposed carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it is the slowest step in the mechanism. This step is facilitated by the gallium species, which provides a suitable environment for the activation of propane. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including binuclear and tetranuclear species, which are involved in the reduction and deactivation processes of the catalyst.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，通过催化剂表面的镓物种激活丙烷分子，导致形成烷基自由基。这些自由基进一步参与反应，如氢转移、环化和氢消除，生成烯烃产物。机制的关键步骤包括丙烷的初始激活以及随后形成烷基自由基。提出的碳烯离子机制涉及形成碳烯离子中间体。CH活化步骤被认为是PDH反应中的决定性步骤（RDS），因为它是在机制中速度最慢的步骤。该步骤由镓物种促进，为丙烷的活化提供了合适的环境。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括二核和四核物种，它们参与催化剂的还原和失活过程。
