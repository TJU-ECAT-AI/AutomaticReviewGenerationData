[1] "Reactions of propane on H-ZSM5 require the activation of C-H bonds and the disposal of the hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions."
[2] "The sequential release of several H-atoms during a propane aromatization turnover limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5."
[3] "Hydrogen is also formed as a result of the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface."
[4] "Modifications of such pentasil zeolites with exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rate of hydrogen disposal, the propane turnover rate,and aromatic selectivity."
[5] "Isotopic studies show that C-H bond activation appears to occur at similar rates on H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5, but that exchanged Ga and Zn cations increase the rates of chemical propane conversion, of recombinative hydrogen desorp- tion, and of incorporation of D-atoms from D 2 into reaction products."
[6] "Reactions over Na-ZSM5 confirm that C-H bond activation occurs predominantly on BrOnsted acid sites."
[7] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."
[8] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the re- combinative desorption of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all-hydrogen (He)."

1. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involve the activation of C-H bonds followed by the disposal of hydrogen atoms produced in these reactions. 

2. The sequential release of multiple hydrogen atoms during a propane aromatization cycle limits the rate and selectivity of this reaction on H-ZSM5.

3. Hydrogen is also generated through the recombinative desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on the zeolite surface.

4. Modifications with gallium (Ga) and zinc (Zn) cations enhance hydrogen disposal, propane turnover, and aromatic selectivity in PDH reactions.

5. Isotopic studies indicate that C-H bond activation rates are comparable across H-ZSM5, Ga/H-ZSM5, and Zn/H-ZSM5 catalysts, but Ga and Zn cations increase chemical propane conversion, recombinative hydrogen desorption, and D-atom incorporation into reaction products.

6. Brønsted acid sites are confirmed as the primary locations for C-H bond activation on Na-ZSM5.

7. Ga and Zn sites boost propene formation by removing hydrogen atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, enabling acid sites to operate more efficiently without producing cracking products.

8. Ga and Zn act as 'portholes', facilitating the recombination of hydrogen atoms, which are formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, into hydrogen gas (H2).

1. 烷基化反应中，丙烷在镓基催化剂上的脱氢涉及C-H键的活化和产生的氢原子的处置。

2. 在H-ZSM5上，多个氢原子的顺序释放限制了丙烷异构化反应的速度和选择性。

3. 氢通过重组吸附氢的重新脱附也产生于载体表面。

4. 镓（Ga）和锌（Zn）的改性可以提高氢的排放率、丙烷的转化率以及芳香族的选择性。

5. 同位素研究显示，H-ZSM5、Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5催化剂上的C-H键活化速率相似，但Ga和Zn离子增加了化学丙烷转化、重组氢脱附以及从D2引入反应产物中的D原子的速率。

6. Brønsted酸性位点在Na-ZSM5上确认为C-H键活化的主要位置。

7. Ga和Zn位点通过移除激活C-H键的酸性位点上的氢原子来促进丙烯的形成，使酸性位点能够在不产生裂解产物的情况下进行循环。

8. Ga和Zn作为“港口”，促进从酸催化C-H键断裂生成的氢原子与氢气（H2）的重组。
