Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

The two major mechanistic routes proposed for alkane conversion over H-ZSM5 involve the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular) [63].

Reactions of propane-2-13C and unlabelled propene over H-ZSM5 were conducted to examine the relative contributions these mechanistic routes during propane dehydrocyclodimerization on H-ZSM5. Bimolecular reaction pathways would result in an increase in propane conversion turnover rates when propene is added to the propane reactants. If the rate of propane conversion remains unchanged when propene is added, the reaction proceeds via a monomolecular mechanism.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, such as Ga/H-ZSM5, involves the activation of propane by hydride abstraction from the reacting alkane by adsorbed carbenium ions (bimolecular) or by addition of protons to alkenes to form a carbenium ion (monomolecular). This process is compared to the carbenium mechanism, which typically involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom to form a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the sequential release of several hydrogen atoms during a propane aromatization turnover, which limits the rate and selectivity of the reaction on H-ZSM5. 

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by enhancing the rate of hydrogen disposal through the recombinative desorption of hydrogen atoms as dihydrogen (H2). This removal of hydrogen facilitates the activation of C-H bonds and allows acid sites to turnover more efficiently without the formation of cracking products. Ga species act as 'portholes' for the desorption of hydrogen atoms, enabling the extraction of valuable H2 with high selectivity from light alkanes.

烷基机制在使用镓基催化剂（如Ga/H-ZSM5）的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及通过吸附碳正离子从反应中的烷烃脱氢化丙烷，形成双分子或通过向烯烃添加质子形成碳正离子形成单分子。这一过程与碳正离子机制进行比较，通常涉及氢原子的抽象形成碳正离子。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为丙烷转化过程中释放多个氢原子的顺序限制了在H-ZSM5上的反应速率和选择性。

烷基机制适用于不同Ga物种结构，通过增强氢的去除率，通过重组脱氢氢原子形成氢（H2）。这种氢的移除促进了C-H键的激活，使酸位点能够更有效地循环，而无需形成裂解产物。Ga物种充当“港口”，用于氢原子的脱氢，允许从轻烷烃中高效提取有价值的H2。

The addition of Ga and Zn species to H-ZSM5 does not appear to perturb these reaction pathways. Initial reaction products do not contain 3C and are formed predominantly from unlabeled propene molecules in the feed mixture. The rate of 3C scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabelled propene, however, is influenced by the presence of Ga and Zn. For example, the 3C-content in propane decreases more slowly with increasing contact time on Zn/H-ZSM5 (Fig. 6) and on Ga/H-ZSM5 (Fig. 5) than on H-ZSM5 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the rate of propene 'hydrogenation' to propane decreases when Ga and Zn are added.

When comparing the alkyl mechanism to the carbenium mechanism in terms of their applicability to different Ga species structures, the alkyl mechanism demonstrates its versatility and efficiency. The addition of Ga and Zn species to H-ZSM5 does not alter the reaction pathways, as the initial reaction products still originate predominantly from unlabeled propene molecules. However, the rate of 3C scrambling between propane-2-13C and unlabeled propene is affected by the presence of Ga and Zn. This indicates that the rate of propene 'hydrogenation' to propane decreases when Ga and Zn are included, highlighting the unique impact of these elements on the alkyl mechanism.

将烷基机制与碳正离子机制在不同Ga物种结构的应用进行比较时，烷基机制显示出了其灵活性和效率。当在H-ZSM5中添加Ga和Zn物种时，这些反应途径并未改变，初始反应产物仍然主要来源于未标记的丙烯分子。然而，3C混合速率在Zn/H-ZSM5（图6）和Ga/H-ZSM5（图5）上随接触时间增加而减慢，与H-ZSM5（图4）相比更为缓慢。这表明当添加Ga和Zn时，丙烯的“氢化”速率降低，突显出这些元素对烷基机制的独特影响。
