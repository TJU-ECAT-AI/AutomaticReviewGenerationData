[1] "The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations. As the alkene chain lengthens,13-scission reactions become faster and ultimately establish a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates with a broad size distribution."

[2] "Reactions of propane on modified H-ZSM5 lead to the formation of a broad range of aromatics, alkanes, and alkenes (Table 2), suggesting the involvement of a complex reaction sequence."

[3] "The initial rate of propene formation is much higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 compared to H-ZSM5, but isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D8 mixtures show that C-H bond activation rate depends weakly on the presence of Ga and Zn."

[4] "The initial propene intermediate, formed by dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels by oligomerization or addition to C 3 + carbocations."

[5] "Ga and Zn sites increase the rate of propene formation by removing H-atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, allowing acid sites to turnover without the formation of cracking products."

[6] "Ga and Zn act as 'portholes' and catalyze the recombination of H-atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all hydrogen (H2). This removal of H-atoms by the recombination is highly desired in order to minimize unwanted by-products such as methane and ethane and to extract valuable H2 with a high selectivity from light alkanes."

1. The initial propene intermediate, created through the dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels through oligomerization or addition to C3+ carbocations. As the alkene chain grows, 13-scission reactions become quicker, ultimately establishing a 'quasi-equilibrated' pool of alkene intermediates with a wide size range.

2. Reactions of propane on modified H-ZSM5 result in the production of a diverse array of aromatics, alkanes, and alkenes, indicating the involvement of a complex reaction sequence.

3. The initial rate of propene production is notably higher on Ga/H-ZSM5 and Zn/H-ZSM5 than on H-ZSM5. However, isotopic evidence from C3Hs/C3D8 mixtures indicates that the C-H bond activation rate is only weakly affected by the presence of Ga and Zn.

4. The initial propene intermediate, produced through the dehydrogenation of propane, undergoes acid-catalyzed chain growth reactions within zeolite channels through oligomerization or addition to C3+ carbocations.

5. Gallium and Zinc sites increase the rate of propene production by removing hydrogen atoms from acid sites that activate C-H bonds, enabling acid sites to operate without generating cracking products.

6. Gallium and Zinc act as 'gateways' and facilitate the recombination of hydrogen atoms, formed from acid-catalyzed C-H bond cleavage, as all hydrogen (H2). This removal of hydrogen atoms through recombination is highly desirable to minimize unwanted by-products like methane and ethane and to efficiently extract valuable H2 from light alkanes with high selectivity.

1. 初始丙烯中间体，通过丙烷的脱氢反应形成，通过择优聚合作用或向C3+碳正离子的添加，在沸石通道中通过酸催化进行链增长反应。随着不饱和键链的增长，13裂解反应变得更快，最终形成了一个'准平衡'的不饱和中间体池，具有广泛的大小分布范围。

2. 烷烃在修改后的H-ZSM5上的反应生成了一种广泛的芳香族、烷烃和烯烃，表明涉及了一个复杂的反应序列。

3. 丙烯的初始产生速率在Ga/H-ZSM5和Zn/H-ZSM5上显著高于H-ZSM5。然而，从C3Hs/C3D8混合物的同位素证据显示，C-H键激活速率对Ga和Zn的存在仅表现出微弱影响。

4. 通过脱氢反应，初始丙烯中间体在择优聚合或向C3+碳正离子的添加作用下，在沸石通道中通过酸催化进行链增长反应。

5. 镓和锌位点通过从激活C-H键的酸位点移除氢原子，加速了丙烯的生成，允许酸位点在不生成裂解产物的情况下进行周转。

6. 镓和锌作为“门户”，促进酸催化C-H键断裂后形成的氢原子的再组合，形成全部氢(H2)。通过再组合去除氢原子是非常理想的，以减少诸如甲烷和乙烷等副产品的产生，并从轻烷烃中高效地提取有价值的H2，具有高选择性。
