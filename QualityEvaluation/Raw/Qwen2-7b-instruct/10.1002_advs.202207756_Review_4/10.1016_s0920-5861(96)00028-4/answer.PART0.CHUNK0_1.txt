Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

"An alternate monomolecular mechanism appears to be favored at high temperatures and low pressures [63] and leads to the direct proto- nation of a propane molecule to form carbonium ions (C3H-). This adsorption step is followed by carbonium ion decomposition into C3H - and H 2 or C2H - and CH 4."

"The addition of Ga and Zn increase the rate of H 2 formation via recombinative desorption of H-atoms formed in dehy- drogenation steps (Fig. 2). In contrast, H-ZSM5 disposes of these H-atoms at significantly lower rates and predominantly by placing them within hydrogen-rich C 1 and C 2 alkanes."

"Clearly, Ga and Zn species increase the re- versibility of H-atom recombinative desorption steps and act as efficient 'portholes' [67] for the removal of H-atoms produced during C-H bond activation steps."

"The requirement for acid sites in order to activate C-H bonds is evident from these stud- ies of the reactions of C3H8/C3D 8 mixtures."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of carbon-hydrogen (CH) bonds, followed by the formation and desorption of hydrogen (H) atoms. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which proposes that a carbenium ion is formed from propane at the initial step. The alkyl mechanism is favored at high temperatures and low pressures, leading to the direct protonation of propane to form a carbonium ion (C3H-). Subsequently, this carbonium ion decomposes into C3H- and H2 or C2H- and CH4.

In PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the activation of CH bonds occurs efficiently, facilitated by the presence of gallium species. This activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most limiting step in the reaction sequence. The gallium species enhance the rate of hydrogen desorption, which is the process of removing hydrogen atoms from the surface of the catalyst. This hydrogen desorption is significantly faster on gallium-based catalysts compared to H-ZSM5, a type of zeolite.

The gallium and zinc species increase the reversibility of the hydrogen desorption step, acting as efficient 'portholes' for the removal of hydrogen atoms produced during the activation of CH bonds. This means that the hydrogen atoms are removed in a more controlled manner, avoiding unwanted side reactions like hydrogenation and cracking, which can reduce the selectivity to desired products.

The requirement for acid sites to activate CH bonds is confirmed through studies of reactions with C3H8/C3D8 mixtures. These studies show that without acid sites, the C-H bond activation step cannot occur, hindering the overall propane dehydrogenation process.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，通过丙烷上碳-氢（CH）键的活化，随后生成并释放氢（H）原子。这一机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者提出在初始步骤中从丙烷形成碳正离子。在高温和低压条件下，烷基机制更占优势，导致直接对丙烷进行质子化形成碳正离子（C3H-）。随后，这个碳正离子分解为C3H-和H2或C2H-和CH4。

在镓基催化剂上的PDH反应中，CH键的活化高效地进行，得益于镓物种的存在。这是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它是反应序列中最限制性的步骤。镓物种增强了氢解吸的速率，即从催化剂表面去除氢原子的过程。与H-ZSM5（一种沸石类型）相比，镓基催化剂上的氢解吸速率要快得多。

镓和锌物种增加了氢解吸附步骤的可逆性，作为去除由CH键活化过程中产生的氢原子的有效“通道”。这意味着氢原子以更可控的方式被移除，避免了如氢化和裂解等可能降低所需产物选择性的副反应。

酸位的存在是激活CH键的必要条件，这一点通过研究C3H8/C3D8混合物的反应得到了证实。这些研究表明，在没有酸位的情况下，无法进行C-H键活化步骤，从而阻碍了整体丙烷脱氢过程。
