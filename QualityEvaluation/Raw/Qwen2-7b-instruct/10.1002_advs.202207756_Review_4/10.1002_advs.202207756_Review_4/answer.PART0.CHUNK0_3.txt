[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."
[2] "Both mechanisms are consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio in their respective ranges of H2 pressure (Figures 10a and 11b)."
[3] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."
[4] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."
[5] "On H-ZSM-5, propane treatment led to the appearance of four peaks centered at 2976, 2937, 2903, and 2878 cm1 (Figure 13bi): assigned to antisymmetric CH3, antisymmetric CH2, symmetric CH3, and symmetric CH2 stretching modes, respectively."
[6] "Three peaks distinct from those on H-ZSM-5 centered at 2966, 2931, and 2874 cm1 were detected on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with two different Ga loadings (Figure 13bii,iii), that is, the presence of Ga alters the CH stretching bands."
[7] "Pulse reactions could determine the oxidation state of metal species and differentiate different species based on their redox properties."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane by the metal cation, forming an alkyl gallium intermediate. This intermediate undergoes β-elimination, resulting in the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. This mechanism is consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio across various hydrogen pressures.

2. The key difference between the alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism lies in the role of gallium species. In the alkyl mechanism, gallium facilitates the formation of an alkyl gallium intermediate, whereas in the carbenium mechanism, gallium helps in the recombination of hydrogen atoms to release hydrogen gas.

3. The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate are proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism.

4. The presence of gallium alters the CH stretching bands in infrared spectroscopy, indicating changes in the chemical environment of the adsorbed hydrocarbons.

5. Pulse reactions can determine the oxidation state of metal species and distinguish between different species based on their redox properties.

1. 在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制涉及丙烷由金属离子激活形成烷基镓中间体。此中间体经历β消除，导致丙烯和氢气的释放。这种机制与在不同氢压下出现的裂解/脱氢比一致。

2. 烷基机制和碳正离子机制之间的关键差异在于镓物种的作用。在烷基机制中，镓促进形成烷基镓中间体，而在碳正离子机制中，镓帮助氢原子的再组合以释放氢气。

3. 在烷基机制中，CH活化步骤和形成烷基金属中间体被提议为决定性步骤（RDS）。
