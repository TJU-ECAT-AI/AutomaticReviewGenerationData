[1] "Similar to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism could be at play regardless of the specific structure of active Ga species, on which propane is initially activated by the metal cation to form the alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by the β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and H2."
[2] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."
[3] "Both mechanisms are consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio in their respective ranges of H2 pressure (Figures 10a and 11b)."
[4] "Bell and co-workers reported that the PDH rate was roughly 1st order at low propane partial pressure and 0th order at higher pressure."
[5] "Interpreting these subtle differences demands caution, as the local environment of adsorbed hydrocarbons could affect spectral features."
[6] "DFT calculations have also been extensively employed to compare the carbenium and alkyl mechanisms, but without a clear consensus."
[7] "We took Ga/H-ZSM-5 as an example to highlight that technological advances and conceptual innovations could deepen the understanding of structureactivity relations."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane by the metal cation, leading to the formation of an alkyl gallium intermediate. This intermediate undergoes β-elimination, resulting in the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The CH activation step, along with the formation of the alkyl metal intermediate, is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This process is consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio across various hydrogen pressures. In comparison to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism can apply to different gallium species structures without considering their specific composition. DFT calculations, although providing insights, do not offer a definitive consensus between the two mechanisms. Ga/H-ZSM-5 exemplifies how advancements in technology and concepts can enhance our understanding of structure-activity relationships in metal-based catalysts.

烷基机制在以镓为基础的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷由金属离子激活，形成烷基镓中间体。该中间体随后进行β消除，导致丙烯和氢的释放。CH激活步骤与形成烷基金属中间体被提议为决定性步骤（RDS）。这一过程与不同氢压力下的裂解/脱氢比率一致。与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制可以在不考虑其特定组成的情况下应用于不同的镓物种结构。虽然第一原理计算提供了见解，但它们并未在两种机制之间提供明确的共识。Ga/H-ZSM-5展示了技术进步和概念创新如何加深我们对金属基催化剂结构-活性关系的理解。
