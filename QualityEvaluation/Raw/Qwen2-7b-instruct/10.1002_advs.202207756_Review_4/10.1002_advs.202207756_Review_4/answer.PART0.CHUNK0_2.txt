[1] "Both mechanisms are consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio in their respective ranges of H2 pressure (Figures 10a and 11b)."
[2] "The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane."
[3] "The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2."
[4] "On H-ZSM-5, propane treatment led to the appearance of four peaks centered at 2976, 2937, 2903, and 2878 cm−1 (Figure 13bi): assigned to antisymmetric CH3, antisymmetric CH2, symmetric CH3, and symmetric CH2 stretching modes, respectively."
[5] "Interpreting these subtle differences demands caution, as the local environment of adsorbed hydrocarbons could affect spectral features."
[6] "The RDS was found to depend on the reaction pathway and proposed active sites. For [GaH2]+, the stepwise alkyl pathway is more favorable, with C-H activation being the RDS."
[7] "Computational investigations of propane activation mechanism on the newly identified Ga2O22+ supported on MFI have yet to be reported and could be an interesting direction to explore in future studies."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane is activated by the metal cation, leading to the formation of an alkyl gallium intermediate. Subsequently, β-elimination occurs, resulting in the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. The CH activation step, characterized by the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, is proposed to be the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. Different gallium species structures support various aspects of the alkyl mechanism, including the activation of the CH bond and the formation of alkyl metal intermediates.

Comparatively, the carbenium mechanism involves facilitating the recombination of hydrogen adatoms to release hydrogen, contrasting with the activation of the CH bond in propane. While both mechanisms align with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio within their respective hydrogen pressure ranges, the alkyl mechanism's focus on the CH activation step makes it distinct from the carbenium mechanism. This step is crucial for the PDH process, as it directly influences the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.

The presence of gallium species, such as Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+, plays a pivotal role in PDH reactions. Gallium facilitates the formation of alkyl metal intermediates, which are essential for the subsequent β-elimination process. The alkyl mechanism's applicability across different gallium species highlights its versatility in catalysis.

Experimental evidence, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, has been instrumental in validating the alkyl mechanism. Changes in the CH stretching bands upon propane treatment on gallium-based catalysts indicate the formation of alkyl metal intermediates. These subtle changes, though requiring careful interpretation due to the influence of local environments, provide insights into the mechanism's dynamics.

Computational studies, particularly density functional theory (DFT) calculations, have explored the activation pathways of propane on gallium species. These investigations have revealed that the RDS varies depending on the proposed active sites. For instance, [GaH2]+ and [GaH]2+ demonstrate more favorable activation pathways through the alkyl mechanism, whereas Ga+ supports the carbenium pathway. These findings underscore the importance of considering gallium species structures in elucidating PDH mechanisms.

Future research could benefit from exploring the propane activation mechanism on newly identified gallium species supported on MFI zeolites. Such studies might uncover novel insights into the PDH process and guide the development of more efficient catalysts. Overall, the alkyl mechanism provides a comprehensive framework for understanding propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts, highlighting the role of gallium species and the significance of the CH activation step.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，特别是基于镓催化剂的反应中，涉及几个关键步骤。首先，丙烷通过金属离子激活，形成烷基镓中间体。随后，发生β-消除，导致丙烯和氢的释放。形成烷基金属中间体的CH激活步骤被提议为PDH过程中的决定性步骤。不同的镓物种结构支持烷基机制的不同方面，包括CH键的激活和烷基金属中间体的形成。

与之相对比，碳正离子机制则侧重于促进氢原子的再组合以释放氢气，而不仅仅是丙烷中CH键的激活。尽管这两种机制在其各自的氢气压力范围内都与裂解/脱氢比率相匹配，但烷基机制聚焦于CH激活步骤，这与碳正离子机制形成了鲜明对比。这一步骤对于PDH过程至关重要，直接关系到反应的效率和选择性。

镓物种，如Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+，在PDH反应中扮演着核心角色。镓促进了烷基金属中间体的形成，这对于后续的β消除过程至关重要。不同镓物种的适用性表明烷基机制的灵活性及其在催化中的应用价值。

实验数据，尤其是傅里叶变换红外光谱法，对于验证烷基机制具有重要意义。在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷处理时，CH伸缩带的变化表明了烷基金属中间体的形成。这些微妙的变化，虽然需要谨慎解读，因为局部环境的影响，提供了机制动态性的洞察。

计算研究，特别是密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，已经探索了丙烷在不同镓物种上的活化路径。这些研究揭示了活性位点的差异对RDS的影响。例如，[GaH2]+和[GaH]2+通过烷基机制显示出更优的激活路径，而Ga+则支持碳正离子途径。这些发现强调了考虑镓物种结构在阐明PDH机制时的重要性。

未来的研究可以受益于探索MFI沸石上新识别的镓物种的丙烷活化机制。这样的研究可能揭示PDH过程的新见解，并指导高效催化剂的发展。总体而言，烷基机制为理解基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢提供了一个全面的框架，突出了镓物种的作用以及CH激活步骤的重要性。
