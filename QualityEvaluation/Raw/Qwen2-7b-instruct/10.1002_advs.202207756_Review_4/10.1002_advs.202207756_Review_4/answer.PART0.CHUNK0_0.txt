2.2.3 Carbenium Mechanism versus Alkyl Mechanism

The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane. Both mechanisms are consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio in their respective ranges of H2 pressure (Figures 10a and 11b).

Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+. Hensen and co-workers applied DRIFTS to investigate the ethane dehydrogenation pathway on Ga/H-ZSM-5 and observed the CH stretching modes attributable to Ga-C2H5 (Figure 13a).

On H-ZSM-5, propane treatment led to the appearance of four peaks centered at 2976, 2937, 2903, and 2878 cm1 (Figure 13bi): assigned to antisymmetric CH3, antisymmetric CH2, symmetric CH3, and symmetric CH2 stretching modes, respectively.

Three peaks distinct from those on H-ZSM-5 centered at 2966, 2931, and 2874 cm1 were detected on Ga/H-ZSM-5 with two different Ga loadings (Figure 13bii,iii), that is, the presence of Ga alters the CH stretching bands.

Interpreting these subtle differences demands caution, as the local environment of adsorbed hydrocarbons could affect spectral features.

Answer: 
The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by the metal cation to form an alkyl gallium intermediate, followed by β-elimination leading to the desorption of propylene and hydrogen. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the role of gallium species is to facilitate the recombination of hydrogen atoms to release hydrogen gas. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its critical role in the reaction pathway. The alkyl mechanism is consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio in the respective ranges of hydrogen pressure. The presence of gallium alters the chemical stretching bands of the adsorbed hydrocarbons, as evidenced by the differences in the infrared spectroscopy data. However, interpreting these subtle differences requires caution due to the potential influence of the local environment of adsorbed hydrocarbons on spectral features.

烷基机制在甲烷转化为丙烯的过程中，甲烷首先被金属离子激活形成烷基镓中间体，随后通过β消除产生丙烯和氢气。与碳正离子机制不同的是，镓的作用是促进氢原子的再组合以释放氢气。CH活化步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它对反应途径至关重要。在相应的氢气压力范围内，烷基机制与裂解/脱氢比率保持一致。镓的存在改变了吸附烃类的化学拉伸带，这从红外光谱数据的差异中可以得到证据。然而，解释这些微妙的差异需要谨慎，因为吸附烃类的局部环境可能会影响光谱特征。
