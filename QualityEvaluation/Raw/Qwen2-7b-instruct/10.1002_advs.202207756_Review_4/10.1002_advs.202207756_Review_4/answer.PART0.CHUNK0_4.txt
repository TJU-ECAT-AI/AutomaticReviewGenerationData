2.2.3 Carbenium Mechanism versus Alkyl Mechanism
The key difference between the two mechanisms is the role of Ga species in PDH: facilitate the recombination of H adatoms to release H2 versus activate the CH bond in propane. Both mechanisms are consistent with the cracking/dehydrogenation ratio in their respective ranges of H2 pressure (Figures 10a and 11b).
Another potentially experimentally verifiable difference between mechanisms is the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, whose CH stretching bands in IR spectroscopy are expected to be different from those in C3H7+.
2.2.3 Carbenium Mechanism versus Alkyl Mechanism
The CH activation step and the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate were proposed as the RDS, as shown in Scheme 2.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane by the metal cation, leading to the formation of an alkyl gallium intermediate. This is followed by β-elimination and the desorption of propylene and hydrogen gas. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the recombination of hydrogen atoms to release hydrogen gas, facilitating the cracking process. The rate-determining step (RDS) is proposed to be the CH activation step, which leads to the formation of an alkyl metal intermediate. This mechanism applies to different gallium species, including Ga+, [GaH]+, and Ga2O22+. Experimentally, the formation of a distinct alkyl metal intermediate, Ga-C3H7, can be detected through infrared spectroscopy, indicating differences in the chemical environment of the adsorbed hydrocarbons under the two mechanisms.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及由金属离子激活丙烷，导致形成烷基镓中间体。随后进行β消除，并释放丙烯和氢气。而卡宾机制涉及氢原子的重新组合以释放氢气，促进裂解过程。速率决定步骤（RDS）被提议是CH激活步骤，导致形成烷基金属中间体。该机制适用于不同的镓物种，包括Ga+、[GaH]+和Ga2O22+。实验上，可以通过红外光谱检测到形成独特的烷基金属中间体Ga-C3H7，这表明两种机制下吸附碳氢化合物化学环境的不同。
