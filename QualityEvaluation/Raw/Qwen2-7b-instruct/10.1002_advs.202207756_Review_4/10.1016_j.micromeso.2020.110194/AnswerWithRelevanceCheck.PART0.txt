          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism provides a simpler understanding of the reaction process.

      <English>
          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves initial propane activation leading to the formation of an alkyl cation, with the CH activation step identified as the rate-determining step (RDS). This mechanism is compared to the carbenium mechanism, and the reasons for considering the CH activation step as the RDS are discussed. The mechanism's applicability to different gallium species structures is also explored.
