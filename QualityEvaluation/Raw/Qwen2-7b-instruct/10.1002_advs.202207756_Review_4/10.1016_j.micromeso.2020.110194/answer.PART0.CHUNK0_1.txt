The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane is activated, leading to the formation of an alkyl cation. This step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its critical role in the reaction's kinetics. The mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which typically involves a different mode of activation and subsequent reaction pathways. The alkyl mechanism's applicability extends to various gallium species structures, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH process.

烷基机制在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷被活化，导致形成烷基正离子。由于其在反应动力学中的关键作用，这一步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS）。该机制与碳正离子机制形成对比，后者通常涉及不同的激活模式和随后的反应途径。烷基机制适用于各种镓物种结构，影响PDH过程的效率和选择性。
