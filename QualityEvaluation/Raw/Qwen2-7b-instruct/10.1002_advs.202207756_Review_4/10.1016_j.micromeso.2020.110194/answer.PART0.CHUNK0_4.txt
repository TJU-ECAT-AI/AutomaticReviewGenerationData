[1] "The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane molecules followed by the formation of an alkyl cation."
[2] "This alkyl cation then undergoes further reactions leading to the production of olefins."
[3] "In comparison to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is characterized by the direct formation of an alkyl cation from the propane molecule."
[4] "The activation step of propane, where it forms the alkyl cation, is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH process."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts starts with the activation of propane molecules, forming an alkyl cation. This cation then undergoes further reactions to produce olefins. Activation of propane, which results in the formation of the alkyl cation, is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this process. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl cation are influenced by the structure of gallium species within the catalyst.
