1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, followed by the activation of CH groups which is considered the rate-determining step (RDS). This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, offering a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The mechanism varies across different gallium species structures, impacting the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic conversion.

1. 在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，烷基机制包含几个关键步骤：初始丙烷活化，随后是CH基团的活化，这被认为是速率决定步骤(RDS)。与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制提供了更易于理解的反应过程。该机制在不同的镓物种结构下有所不同，影响催化转化的选择性和效率。
