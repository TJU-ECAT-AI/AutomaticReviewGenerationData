[1] "In this case, the main contribution of gallium species on the conventional ZSM-5 corresponded to the bulk Ga2O3 structure."
[2] "The reaction mechanisms of n-pentane dehydrogenation to 1-pentene over Ga-embedded zeolites were examined."
[3] "The mechanism for the GaH2 + embedded zeolite (Fig. 8B) has been proposed by the following three-step mechanism."
[4] "It was found that the rate determining step was the decom- position of Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene with the activation energy of 63.8 kcal mol1 (Fig. 8C, black)."
[5] "On the other hand, the different mechanism was obtained in case of gallium oligomer embedded in the conventional ZSM-5, including the two-step mechanism of the activation of the C-H bond of n-pentane to form a Brnsted acid proton at zeolite framework and the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form alkene together with regenerated gallium active sites."
[6] "In other words, the n-pentane dehydrogenation over highly dispersed Ga species on nano-sheet ZSM-5 is more favorable than that of the bulk Ga fragment embedded in the conventional zeolite."

1. The primary role of gallium species in conventional ZSM-5 is associated with the bulk Ga2O3 structure.
2. The processes of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts were analyzed.
3. A three-step mechanism for PDH on a GaH2 + embedded zeolite was proposed.
4. The rate-determining step in PDH was found to be the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene, with an activation energy of 63.8 kcal mol−1.
5. When gallium is embedded in the conventional ZSM-5, a two-step mechanism involving the activation of the C-H bond of propane and the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form alkene occurs.
6. PDH over highly dispersed Ga species on nanosheet ZSM-5 is more favorable compared to the bulk Ga fragment in conventional zeolite.
