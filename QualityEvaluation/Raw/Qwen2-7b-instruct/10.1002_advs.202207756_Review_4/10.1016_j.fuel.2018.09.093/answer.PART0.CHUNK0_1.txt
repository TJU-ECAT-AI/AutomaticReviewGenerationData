[1] "The reaction mechanisms of n-pentane dehydrogenation, which was considered as the rate determining step of alkane aromatization [46], were examined."
[2] "It was found that the rate determining step was the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form alkene with the activation energy of 63.8 kcal mol−1 (Fig. 8C, black)."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the C-H bond of propane to form a carbenium ion, followed by the removal of hydrogen to form propene. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it requires the highest energy input among the key steps. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the dispersion and coordination state of Ga affecting the activation energy and thus the overall efficiency of the PDH reaction.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂上涉及丙烷C-H键的活化，形成一个碳正离子中间体，随后通过去除氢原子形成丙烯。该机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及形成一个碳正离子中间体。活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它需要输入最高的能量，这是关键步骤之一。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，Ga的分散性和配位状态影响活化能，从而影响PDH反应的整体效率。
