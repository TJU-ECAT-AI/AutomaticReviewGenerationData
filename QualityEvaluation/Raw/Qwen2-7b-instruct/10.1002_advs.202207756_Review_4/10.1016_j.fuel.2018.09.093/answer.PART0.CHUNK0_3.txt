There are no relevant quotes in the literature to provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The comparison to the carbenium mechanism, discussion of why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explanation of how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures cannot be derived from the given literature.

文献中没有相关引用来提供对丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中基于镓催化剂的烷基机制的全面解释，包括从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。与碳正离子机制的比较、为什么认为CH活化步骤是速率决定步骤(RDS)，以及不同Ga物种结构下烷基机制的应用解释都无法从给定的文献中得出。
