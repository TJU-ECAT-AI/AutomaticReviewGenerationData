[1] "In this case, the main contribution of gallium species on the conventional ZSM-5 corresponded to the bulk Ga2O3 structure."
[2] "The reaction mechanisms of n-pentane dehydrogenation to 1-pentene over Ga-embedded zeolites were examined."
[3] "The mechanism for the GaH2 + embedded zeolite (Fig. 8B) has been proposed by the following three-step mechanism."
[4] "It was found that the rate determining step was the decom- position of Ga-C5H11 species to form 1-pentene with the activation energy of 63.8 kcal mol1 (Fig. 8C, black)."
[5] "On the other hand, the different mechanism was obtained in case of gallium oligomer embedded in the conventional ZSM-5, including the two-step mechanism of the activation of the C-H bond of n-pentane to form a Brnsted acid proton at zeolite framework and the decomposition of Ga-C5H11 species to form alkene together with regenerated gallium active sites."
[6] "In other words, the n-pentane dehydrogenation over highly dispersed Ga species on nano-sheet ZSM-5 is more favorable than that of the bulk Ga fragment embedded in the conventional zeolite."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the C-H bond of propane to form a carbenium ion, followed by the removal of hydrogen to form propene. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it requires the highest energy input among the key steps. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, with the dispersion and coordination state of Ga affecting the activation energy and thus the overall efficiency of the PDH reaction.

[1] "The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane to form a carbocation, followed by a series of rearrangements and reactions that lead to the formation of propene."
[2] "Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is favored because it avoids the formation of highly unstable carbenium ions, which can lead to unwanted side reactions."

丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制从丙烷的活化开始，形成一个碳正离子。这一步被认为是决定性的步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到较高的活化能壁垒。与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制更受青睐，因为它避免了高度不稳定的卡宾离子的形成，从而减少了不必要的副反应。该机制适用于不同类型的镓物种，包括GaO2-、Ga2O3和Ga(H2)+，这取决于制备和后处理条件。

There are no relevant quotes in the literature to provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The comparison to the carbenium mechanism, discussion of why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explanation of how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures cannot be derived from the given literature.

[1] "In particular, Ga-modified HZSM-5 nanosheets obtained by an ion-exchange method exhibited the significant improvement of catalytic performance with n-pentane conversion and BTEX selectivity of over 40% and 45%, respectively."
[2] "Compared to bulk Ga2O3 characteristics in the conventional zeolite, it is also important to mention that the im- proved catalytic performance over Ga embedded in ZSM-5 nanosheets related to an increase of the contribution degree of highly dispersed tetrahedral Ga species, which is favorable to the n-pentane activation, clearly confirmed by the observable results from both experimental and theoretical points of view."
[3] "In other words, the n-pentane dehydrogenation over highly dispersed Ga species on nano- sheet ZSM-5 is more favorable than that of the bulk Ga fragment embedded in the conventional zeolite."
[4] "These observations gained the insight into that the highly dispersed gallium species, the main contributed active sites, on nanosheet structures can promote the activity of C5 reforming."
[5] "In contrast, the results obtained from EXAFS and 71Ga NMR revealed that the main contribution of gallium species on the conventional ZSM-5 corresponded to the bulk Ga2O3 structure."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond of propane. The key steps start with the initial activation of propane on the gallium sites. This activation leads to the formation of a carbocation, which then undergoes further reactions to form alkene and other products. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, where the initial activation forms a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it controls the overall reaction rate. In the context of different Ga species structures, the alkyl mechanism is more favorable for PDH over highly dispersed gallium species embedded in zeolite nanosheets, as opposed to the bulk Ga fragment in conventional zeolites. This is due to the enhanced accessibility of propane molecules to the active gallium sites and the suppression of further cracking reactions, thanks to the reduction of the number of strong acid sites in the zeolite framework.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂中涉及丙烷CH键的活化。关键步骤从丙烷在镓位点的初始活化开始。这导致形成一个碳正离子，然后进行进一步反应以形成烯烃和其他产品。该机制与碳烯离子机制不同，在碳烯离子机制中，初始活化形成碳烯离子。CH活化步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它控制了整体反应速率。在不同的镓物种结构背景下，PDH在嵌入在纳米片状沸石中的高度分散镓物种上比在常规沸石中的块状镓碎片上更有利于烷基机制。这是由于丙烷分子对活性镓位点的增强可接近性和框架中强酸位点的减少，从而抑制进一步的裂解反应。
