[1] "The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane to form a carbocation, followed by a series of rearrangements and reactions that lead to the formation of propene."
[2] "Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is favored because it avoids the formation of highly unstable carbenium ions, which can lead to unwanted side reactions."
[3] "The activation of propane to form a carbocation is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high activation energy barrier involved."
[4] "The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, including GaO2-, Ga2O3, and Ga(H2)+, depending on the preparation conditions and post-treatment procedures."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts starts with the activation of propane to form a carbocation. This step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high activation energy barrier. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is favored as it avoids the formation of highly unstable carbenium ions, thus reducing unwanted side reactions. The mechanism applies to different gallium species, including GaO2-, Ga2O3, and Ga(H2)+, depending on the preparation and post-treatment conditions.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制从丙烷的活化开始，形成一个碳正离子。这一步被认为是决定性的步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到较高的活化能壁垒。与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制更受青睐，因为它避免了高度不稳定的卡宾离子的形成，从而减少了不必要的副反应。该机制适用于不同类型的镓物种，包括GaO2-、Ga2O3和Ga(H2)+，这取决于制备和后处理条件。
