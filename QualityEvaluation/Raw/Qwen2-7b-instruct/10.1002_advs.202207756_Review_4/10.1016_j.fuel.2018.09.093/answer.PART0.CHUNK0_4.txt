[1] "In particular, Ga-modified HZSM-5 nanosheets obtained by an ion-exchange method exhibited the significant improvement of catalytic performance with n-pentane conversion and BTEX selectivity of over 40% and 45%, respectively."
[2] "Compared to bulk Ga2O3 characteristics in the conventional zeolite, it is also important to mention that the im- proved catalytic performance over Ga embedded in ZSM-5 nanosheets related to an increase of the contribution degree of highly dispersed tetrahedral Ga species, which is favorable to the n-pentane activation, clearly confirmed by the observable results from both experimental and theoretical points of view."
[3] "In other words, the n-pentane dehydrogenation over highly dispersed Ga species on nano- sheet ZSM-5 is more favorable than that of the bulk Ga fragment embedded in the conventional zeolite."
[4] "These observations gained the insight into that the highly dispersed gallium species, the main contributed active sites, on nanosheet structures can promote the activity of C5 reforming."
[5] "In contrast, the results obtained from EXAFS and 71Ga NMR revealed that the main contribution of gallium species on the conventional ZSM-5 corresponded to the bulk Ga2O3 structure."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond of propane. The key steps start with the initial activation of propane on the gallium sites. This activation leads to the formation of a carbocation, which then undergoes further reactions to form alkene and other products. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, where the initial activation forms a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it controls the overall reaction rate. In the context of different Ga species structures, the alkyl mechanism is more favorable for PDH over highly dispersed gallium species embedded in zeolite nanosheets, as opposed to the bulk Ga fragment in conventional zeolites. This is due to the enhanced accessibility of propane molecules to the active gallium sites and the suppression of further cracking reactions, thanks to the reduction of the number of strong acid sites in the zeolite framework.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂中涉及丙烷CH键的活化。关键步骤从丙烷在镓位点的初始活化开始。这导致形成一个碳正离子，然后进行进一步反应以形成烯烃和其他产品。该机制与碳烯离子机制不同，在碳烯离子机制中，初始活化形成碳烯离子。CH活化步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它控制了整体反应速率。在不同的镓物种结构背景下，PDH在嵌入在纳米片状沸石中的高度分散镓物种上比在常规沸石中的块状镓碎片上更有利于烷基机制。这是由于丙烷分子对活性镓位点的增强可接近性和框架中强酸位点的减少，从而抑制进一步的裂解反应。
