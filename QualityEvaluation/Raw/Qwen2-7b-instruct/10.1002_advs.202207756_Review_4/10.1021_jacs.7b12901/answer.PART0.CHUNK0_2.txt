1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several critical steps. Initially, propane is activated, leading to the formation of an alkyl intermediate. This process is followed by the activation of the carbon-hydrogen bond (CH activation), which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH reaction. The alkyl mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, contributing to the efficiency of the PDH process on gallium-based catalysts.

1. 在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制涉及几个关键步骤。首先，丙烷被激活，形成烷基中间体。随后是碳-氢键（CH键）的活化，这被认为是PDH反应的速率决定步骤（RDS）。烷基机制适用于各种Ga物种结构，有助于在镓基催化剂上实现PDH过程的效率。
