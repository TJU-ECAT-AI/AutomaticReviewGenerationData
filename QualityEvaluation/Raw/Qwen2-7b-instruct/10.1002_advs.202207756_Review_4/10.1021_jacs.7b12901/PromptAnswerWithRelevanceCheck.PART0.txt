Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

[1] "The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps."
[2] "These mechanisms differ from the carbenium mechanism due to the distinct activation of the alkyl group."
[3] "The activation of the CH group is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in these reactions."
[4] "This step involves the breaking of the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH group, which is considered the rate-determining step (RDS). This process begins with the breaking of the C-H bond, resulting in the formation of an alkyl radical. Subsequently, this radical reacts with other molecules to produce various products. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the activation of a different group occurs.

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several critical steps. Initially, propane is activated, leading to the formation of an alkyl intermediate. This process is followed by the activation of the carbon-hydrogen bond (CH activation), which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH reaction. The alkyl mechanism applies to various Ga species structures, contributing to the efficiency of the PDH process on gallium-based catalysts.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane (C3H8) to form an alkyl cation intermediate. This cation then undergoes further reactions to yield propylene (C3H6) as the primary product. The carbenium mechanism contrasts with this, typically associated with PDH on transition metal catalysts. The CH activation step within the alkyl mechanism is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the thermodynamically challenging nature of the activation process. The application of the alkyl mechanism varies across different Ga species structures, influenced by their distinct electronic properties and coordination environments. These variations impact the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH reaction.

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by gallium species, which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). This step is crucial for the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is more efficient because the activation of propane by gallium species is considered the RDS, whereas the carbenium mechanism has a higher energy barrier in its activation step, making it less efficient.

2. The carbenium mechanism, although applicable to propane dehydrogenation, is less efficient than the alkyl mechanism. The reason for this is that the activation step in the carbenium mechanism involves a higher energy barrier, making it less favorable compared to the alkyl mechanism, where the activation of propane by gallium species is the rate-determining step.

1. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤，包括丙烷由镓物种激活。该步骤被提议为PDH反应的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这个步骤对于脱氢过程的效率至关重要。与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制更有效率，因为丙烷由镓物种的激活步骤被认为是控制整体反应速率的关键，影响脱氢过程的效率。

2. 虽然碳正离子机制适用于丙烷脱氢，但它比烷基机制效率低。原因在于碳正离子机制的激活步骤涉及更高的能量壁垒，使其不如烷基机制有利。在烷基机制中，丙烷由镓物种的激活是速率决定步骤，而碳正离子机制的激活步骤具有较高的能量壁垒，导致其效率较低。
