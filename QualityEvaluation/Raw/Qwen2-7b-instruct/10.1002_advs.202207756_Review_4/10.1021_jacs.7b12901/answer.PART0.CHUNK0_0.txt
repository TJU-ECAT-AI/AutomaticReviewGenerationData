The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH group, which is considered the rate-determining step (RDS). This process begins with the breaking of the C-H bond, resulting in the formation of an alkyl radical. Subsequently, this radical reacts with other molecules to produce various products. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the activation of a different group occurs.

烷基机制在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及CH组的活化，这是决定性步骤（RDS）。这个过程始于C-H键的断裂，导致形成烷基自由基。随后，这个自由基与其它分子反应产生各种产物。这一机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及活化不同的组分。
