The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane (C3H8) to form an alkyl cation intermediate. This cation then undergoes further reactions to yield propylene (C3H6) as the primary product. The carbenium mechanism contrasts with this, typically associated with PDH on transition metal catalysts. The CH activation step within the alkyl mechanism is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the thermodynamically challenging nature of the activation process. The application of the alkyl mechanism varies across different Ga species structures, influenced by their distinct electronic properties and coordination environments. These variations impact the selectivity and efficiency of the PDH reaction.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）中涉及丙烷（C3H8）的活化，形成烷基正离子中间体。然后，该正离子进一步反应生成主要产物丙烯（C3H6）。碳正离子机制与之相对，通常与基于过渡金属的催化剂相关联。烷基机制中的CH活化步骤被认定为决定性步骤（RDS），因为活化过程具有热力学挑战性。烷基机制在不同的Ga物种结构下的应用有所不同，这受到它们独特的电子性质和配位环境的影响。这些差异影响PDH反应的选择性和效率。
