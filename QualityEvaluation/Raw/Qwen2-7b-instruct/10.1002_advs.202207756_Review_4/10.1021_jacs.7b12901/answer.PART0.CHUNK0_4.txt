1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane by gallium species, which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). This step is crucial for the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is more efficient because the activation of propane by gallium species is considered the RDS, whereas the carbenium mechanism has a higher energy barrier in its activation step, making it less efficient.

2. The carbenium mechanism, although applicable to propane dehydrogenation, is less efficient than the alkyl mechanism. The reason for this is that the activation step in the carbenium mechanism involves a higher energy barrier, making it less favorable compared to the alkyl mechanism, where the activation of propane by gallium species is the rate-determining step.

1. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤，包括丙烷由镓物种激活。该步骤被提议为PDH反应的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这个步骤对于脱氢过程的效率至关重要。与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制更有效率，因为丙烷由镓物种的激活步骤被认为是控制整体反应速率的关键，影响脱氢过程的效率。

2. 虽然碳正离子机制适用于丙烷脱氢，但它比烷基机制效率低。原因在于碳正离子机制的激活步骤涉及更高的能量壁垒，使其不如烷基机制有利。在烷基机制中，丙烷由镓物种的激活是速率决定步骤，而碳正离子机制的激活步骤具有较高的能量壁垒，导致其效率较低。
