[1] "To carry out a consistent comparison between several dehydrogenation mechanisms, we first investigated the alkyl activation pathway proposed by Frash and van Santen [37] using a larger cluster model (11 T cluster, site I) of the catalytic site than their original work."

[2] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

[3] "For the a-type site (V), we report the reaction path for carbenium activation in Fig. 7a."

[4] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."

[5] "The other two cluster models containing two Al T sites (VI and VII), represent the g-type site according to the classification by Dedecek et al. [55]."

[6] "We find that the catalyst site is more active, like in model VII for the eight-membered ring, then the CH activation barrier is very low."

[7] "The trends in reactivity show that higher site stability, and consequently smaller AlAl distances, resulted in larger activation barriers for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and lower barriers for H2 desorption and site regeneration (15.49 kcal/mol)."

[8] "This competition between two trends exemplifies the applicability of the Sabatier principle."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond followed by the removal of hydrogen. The key steps include initial propane adsorption, hydrogen removal, and the formation of an alkene.

2. The proposed carbenium mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond to form an alkoxide intermediate, followed by the removal of hydrogen to form an alkene. The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high activation energy.

3. Different Ga species structures affect the reactivity of the PDH process. Structures with smaller Al-Al distances tend to have lower activation barriers for the CH activation step, which is beneficial for the RDS.

4. The carbenium mechanism is characterized by a higher activation barrier for the CH activation step compared to the alkyl mechanism. This is because the former requires the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, which adds an extra step to the reaction sequence.

5. Structures with two Al atoms located in an eight-membered ring exhibit higher activity than those in a six-membered ring. This is attributed to the increased stability of the [GaH]2+ species, which results in lower activation barriers for the CH activation step.

6. The optimal Al-Al distance for dehydrogenation reactions is found to be 4.53 Å, balancing the competing trends of decreasing CH activation barrier and increasing H2 removal barrier. This distance demonstrates the applicability of the Sabatier principle.

1. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及CH键的活化，随后是氢的去除。关键步骤包括丙烷吸附、氢去除和烯烃的形成。

2. 提议的卡宾机制涉及活化CH键以形成醇中间体，随后是氢的去除以形成烯烃。CH活化步骤被确定为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它具有较高的活化能。

3. 不同的Ga物种结构影响PDH过程的活性。具有较小Al-Al距离的结构倾向于具有更低的CH活化步骤活化壁垒，这对RDS有利。

4. 与烷基机制相比，卡宾机制的CH活化步骤的活化壁垒更高。这是因为后者需要形成醇中间体，这增加了反应序列的额外步骤。

5. 具有两个Al原子位于八元环中的结构比六元环中的结构表现出更高的活性。这归因于[GaH]2+物种的增加稳定性，导致CH活化步骤的活化壁垒降低。

6. 脱氢反应的最佳Al-Al距离被发现为4.53 Å，平衡了减少CH活化壁垒和增加H2去除壁垒的趋势。这个距离展示了萨巴提尔原理的应用性。
