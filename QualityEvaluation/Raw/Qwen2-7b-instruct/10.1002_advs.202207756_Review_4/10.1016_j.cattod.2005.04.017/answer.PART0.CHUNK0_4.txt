[1] "In an attempt to find a catalytic environment, which better facilitates alkene desorption, we considered three-different sites for this study. The first active site represents an a-type site as per the classification of pair sites by Dedecek et al. These sites consist of a pair of five-membered rings fused to form a slightly elongated six-membered ring."
[2] "For the a-typesite (V), we found this reaction (process V + H2 ! XII) to be endothermic with 27.88 kcal/mol heat of reaction. We will, hence forth, refer to this as H2 site-reduction and designate the heat of this reaction as DHred."
[3] "Our investigation of the carbenium activation mechanism consists of three-distinct steps: (1) activation of the CH bond and formation of an alkoxide like intermediate, (2) removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene and (3) desorption of molecular hydrogen to complete the catalytic cycle."
[4] "For the a-type site (V), we report the reaction path for carbenium activation in Fig. 7a. We have limited our investigation only to the activation of the CH bond and removal of dihydrogen to regenerate the active site."
[5] "The other two cluster models containing two Al T sites (VI and VII), represent the g-type site according to the classification by Dedecek et al. [55]."
[6] "In an attempt to find a catalytic environment, which better facilitates alkene desorption, we considered three-different sites for this study. The first active site represents an a-type site as per the classification of pair sites by Dedecek et al. These sites consist of a pair of five-membered rings fused to form a slightly elongated six-membered ring."
[7] "Comparing AlAl distances in the relaxed models, we find 4.60 A for structure VI (Fig. 2) compared to 5.53 A for structure VII (Fig. 2)."
[8] "In Fig. 8, we report the energetics of the carbenium activation mechanism for site VI. We found that the CH activation part consists of two steps."
[9] "In model VII, the two-step process of dissociative adsorption of H2 (Table 2) indicates that this catalytic site is more active than the models V and VI."
[10] "A similar reaction path for g-type site with different Al positions (VII) is shown in Fig. 9. The exothermic dissociative adsorption of H2 (Table 2) indicates that this catalytic site is more active than the models V and VI."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a series of steps. Initially, propane is activated by the gallium species, resulting in the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate. Subsequently, this intermediate undergoes desorption, releasing an alkene and regenerating the active site. This mechanism is compared to the carbenium mechanism, which proposes activation of the carbon-hydrogen bond followed by desorption of the alkene and hydrogen molecules. The CH activation step in the alkyl mechanism is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high activation energy required for this process. This step is facilitated by the gallium species, which removes hydrogen from the propane molecule, forming the alkoxide intermediate. Different Ga species structures, such as the a-type, g-type, and dual Al sites, are considered in the study. The a-type site is characterized by a fused six-membered ring structure, while the g-type site has an eight-membered ring configuration. The Al-Al distances for these sites vary, with the a-type site having a distance of 4.53 Å, and the g-type site having a distance of 5.53 Å. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by altering the activation energy and the efficiency of the desorption step. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, focuses on the formation of a carbenium intermediate and its subsequent desorption, leading to the production of an alkene and hydrogen molecules.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及一系列步骤。首先，丙烷通过镓物种被激活，导致形成一个醇氧化物类中间体。随后，这个中间体经历脱附，释放出烯烃并再生活性位点。与碳-氢键的活化和随后烯烃及氢分子的脱附的卡宾机制相比，烷基机制将碳-氢键活化步骤作为速率决定步骤（RDS）。由于该过程需要较高的活化能，因此碳-氢键活化步骤由镓物种促进，从丙烷分子中移除氢原子，形成醇氧化物中间体。考虑的不同Ga物种结构包括a型、g型和双铝位点。a型位点具有六元环结构特征，而g型位点具有八元环配置。这些站点的Al-Al距离不同，a型站点的距离为4.53 Å，而g型站点的距离为5.53 Å。不同的Ga物种结构通过改变活化能和脱附步骤的效率来应用烷基机制。另一方面，卡宾机制专注于形成卡宾中间体及其随后的脱附，产生烯烃和氢分子。
