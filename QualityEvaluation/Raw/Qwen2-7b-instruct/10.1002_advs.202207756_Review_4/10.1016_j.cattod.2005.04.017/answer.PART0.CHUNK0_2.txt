The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond followed by desorption of the alkene and molecular hydrogen to regenerate the active site. The key steps include adsorption of propane, hydrogen removal, formation of an alkoxide near the second aluminum, and subsequent desorption of the alkene. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). The alkyl mechanism applies differently to different Ga species structures, with the six-membered ring structure representing the most stable site and thus having the lowest activation barrier for CH activation.

The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves activation of the CH bond and formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate, followed by desorption of the primary alkoxide and desorption of molecular hydrogen to regenerate the active site. The CH activation step in this mechanism is also proposed as the RDS. The Al-Al distance affects the stability of the carbenium site, with smaller distances leading to lower activation barriers for CH activation but higher barriers for hydrogen removal.

The alkyl mechanism is favored by a polar environment surrounding gallium species, while the carbenium mechanism benefits from the polarity of the gallium-oxygen coordination. The competition between these two trends exemplifies the applicability of the Sabatier principle in determining the optimal Al-Al distance for maximum dehydrogenation activity.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及CH键的活化，随后是烯烃和分子氢的脱除，以再生活性位点。关键步骤包括丙烷的吸附、氢的去除、形成邻近第二个铝的醇氧，并随后脱除烯烃。初始CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS）。该烷基机制对不同的镓物种结构应用不同，六元环结构代表最稳定的站点，因此具有最低的CH活化壁垒。

碳正离子机制则涉及CH键的活化，形成类似醇的中间体，随后是主醇的脱除和分子氢的脱除，以再生活性位点。在这个机制中，CH活化步骤也被提议为RDS。Al-Al距离影响碳正离子站点的稳定性，较小的距离导致较低的CH活化壁垒但较高的氢脱除壁垒。

烷基机制受到围绕镓物种的极性环境的青睐，而碳正离子机制受益于镓-氧配位的极性。这两种趋势之间的竞争体现了萨巴蒂尔原理在确定最大脱氢活性的最优Al-Al距离的应用。
