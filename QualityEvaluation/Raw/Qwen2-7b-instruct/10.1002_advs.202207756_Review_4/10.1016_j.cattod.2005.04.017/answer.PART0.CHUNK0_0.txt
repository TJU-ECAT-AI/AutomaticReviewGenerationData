[1] "In an attempt to find a catalytic environment, which better facilitates alkene desorption, we considered three-different sites for this study. The first active site represents an a-type site as per the classification of pair sites by Dedecek et al. These sites consist of a pair of five-membered rings fused to form a slightly elongated six-membered ring."
[2] "Our investigation of the carbenium activation mechanism consists of three-distinct steps: (1) activation of the CH bond and formation of an alkoxide like intermediate, (2) removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene and (3) desorption of molecular hydrogen to complete the catalytic cycle."
[3] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal. Schematically, the [GaH]2+ species is responsible for removing hydrogen from the alkane during this step, forming the traditional [HGaH]+ moiety residing on one of the Al atoms."
[4] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."
[5] "We conclude that out of several possible catalytic sites in Ga-HZSM-5, extra-framework gallium species near pairs of tetrahedral Al have higher activity, and the activity of these sites can be correlated to AlAl distance."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond followed by the removal of hydrogen from propane to form an alkene and molecular hydrogen. The [GaH]2+ species plays a crucial role in this process by removing hydrogen from the propane molecule. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the activation of the CH bond, formation of an alkoxide intermediate, and subsequent desorption of the alkene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because of its high activation energy barrier. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to different Ga species structures, with the activity of these sites being correlated to the Al-Al distance.

The carbenium mechanism consists of three distinct steps: activation of the CH bond, removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene, and desorption of molecular hydrogen. The [GaH]2+ species is responsible for removing hydrogen from the alkane during the CH activation step, forming the traditional [HGaH]+ moiety. The high activation energy barrier for the CH activation step (85.72 kcal/mol) makes it the rate-determining step in the process.

The activity of the catalytic sites in Ga-HZSM-5 is higher for extra-framework gallium species near pairs of tetrahedral Al, and the activity can be correlated to the Al-Al distance. This finding provides insight into the design of novel catalysts for alkane activation processes.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及烷基的激活和从丙烷分子中移除氢原子以形成烯烃和分子氢。[GaH]2+物种在此过程中扮演着关键角色，通过从丙烷分子中去除氢原子。卡本离子机制则涉及到烷基的激活、形成烷氧基中间体以及随后烯烃的脱附。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤，因为它具有较高的活化能壁垒。烷基机制对不同的Ga物种结构应用不同，这些位点的活性与Al-Al距离相关。

卡本离子机制包含三个独立步骤：CH键的激活、通过脱附烯烃从主要烷氧基的去除、以及分子氢的脱附。[GaH]2+物种负责在CH激活步骤中从烷基去除氢原子，形成传统的[HGaH]+物种。CH激活步骤（85.72 kcal/mol）的高活化能壁垒使其成为过程中的决定性步骤。

在Ga-HZSM-5中的催化位点活动更高的是位于四面体Al对附近的额外框架镓物种，并且活性可以与Al-Al距离相关联。这一发现为设计烷烃激活过程中的新型催化剂提供了见解。
