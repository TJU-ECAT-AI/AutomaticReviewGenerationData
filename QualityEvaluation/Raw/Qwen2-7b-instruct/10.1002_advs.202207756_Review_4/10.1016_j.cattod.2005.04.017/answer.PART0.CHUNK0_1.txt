[1] "An alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane. This activation leads to the formation of an alkoxide near one of the aluminum atoms, which subsequently adsorbs as an alkoxide."
[2] "In the carbenium mechanism, the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate occur."
[3] "The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most significant energy barrier."
[4] "The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures. For instance, in the mono-Al site, the activation energy is too high compared to experimental values."
[5] "In contrast, for the di-Al sites, the optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 Å arises from the competition between the decreasing barrier for CH activation and the increasing barrier for H2 removal."
[6] "The carbenium mechanism on the gallium species [GaH]2+ near two aluminum sites results in a series of distinct steps: activation of the CH bond, removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene, and desorption of molecular hydrogen."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts starts with the activation of propane, leading to the formation of an alkoxide near one of the aluminum atoms. This alkoxide then adsorbs as an alkoxide. 
2. The carbenium mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond, resulting in the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate. 
3. The activation of the CH bond is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in these reactions because it has the highest activation energy barrier. 
4. The alkyl mechanism can apply to different gallium species structures, such as the mono-Al site, where the activation energy is excessively high compared to experimental values. 
5. For di-Al sites, the optimal AlAl separation distance of 4.53 Å is achieved through the balance of decreasing CH activation barrier and increasing H2 removal barrier. 
6. The carbenium mechanism on gallium species [GaH]2+ near two aluminum sites comprises three distinct steps: activation of the CH bond, removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene, and desorption of molecular hydrogen.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，镓基催化剂上的烷基机制从丙烷的活化开始，导致在其中一个铝原子附近形成一个烷氧基。然后，这个烷氧基以烷氧基的形式吸附。
2. 碳正离子机制涉及CH键的活化，导致形成一个类似醇的中间体。
3. 活化CH键被认定为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它具有最高的活化能壁垒。
4. 烷基机制可以应用于不同的镓物种结构，例如单-Al位点，其活化能远高于实验值。
5. 对于双-Al位点，通过减少CH活化壁垒和增加H2去除壁垒之间的平衡，达到4.53 Å的最佳Al-Al分离距离。
6. 在靠近两个铝原子的镓物种[GaH]2+上的碳正离子机制包括三个独立步骤：活化CH键、通过脱除烷基去除初级醇，并脱除分子氢。
