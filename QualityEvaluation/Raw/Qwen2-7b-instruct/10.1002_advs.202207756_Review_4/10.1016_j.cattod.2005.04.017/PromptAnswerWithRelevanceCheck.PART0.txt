[1] "In an attempt to find a catalytic environment, which better facilitates alkene desorption, we considered three-different sites for this study. The first active site represents an a-type site as per the classification of pair sites by Dedecek et al. These sites consist of a pair of five-membered rings fused to form a slightly elongated six-membered ring."
[2] "Our investigation of the carbenium activation mechanism consists of three-distinct steps: (1) activation of the CH bond and formation of an alkoxide like intermediate, (2) removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene and (3) desorption of molecular hydrogen to complete the catalytic cycle."
[3] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal. Schematically, the [GaH]2+ species is responsible for removing hydrogen from the alkane during this step, forming the traditional [HGaH]+ moiety residing on one of the Al atoms."
[4] "The activation barrier for CH activation is directly related to the large endothermicity of the CH activation step (DE = 51.40 kcal/mol)."
[5] "We conclude that out of several possible catalytic sites in Ga-HZSM-5, extra-framework gallium species near pairs of tetrahedral Al have higher activity, and the activity of these sites can be correlated to AlAl distance."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond followed by the removal of hydrogen from propane to form an alkene and molecular hydrogen. The [GaH]2+ species plays a crucial role in this process by removing hydrogen from the propane molecule. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the activation of the CH bond, formation of an alkoxide intermediate, and subsequent desorption of the alkene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because of its high activation energy barrier. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to different Ga species structures, with the activity of these sites being correlated to the Al-Al distance.

The carbenium mechanism consists of three distinct steps: activation of the CH bond, removal of the primary alkoxide by desorption of an alkene, and desorption of molecular hydrogen. The [GaH]2+ species is responsible for removing hydrogen from the alkane during the CH activation step, forming the traditional [HGaH]+ moiety. The high activation energy barrier for the CH activation step (85.72 kcal/mol) makes it the rate-determining step in the process.

The activity of the catalytic sites in Ga-HZSM-5 is higher for extra-framework gallium species near pairs of tetrahedral Al, and the activity can be correlated to the Al-Al distance. This finding provides insight into the design of novel catalysts for alkane activation processes.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及烷基的激活和从丙烷分子中移除氢原子以形成烯烃和分子氢。[GaH]2+物种在此过程中扮演着关键角色，通过从丙烷分子中去除氢原子。卡本离子机制则涉及到烷基的激活、形成烷氧基中间体以及随后烯烃的脱附。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤，因为它具有较高的活化能壁垒。烷基机制对不同的Ga物种结构应用不同，这些位点的活性与Al-Al距离相关。

卡本离子机制包含三个独立步骤：CH键的激活、通过脱附烯烃从主要烷氧基的去除、以及分子氢的脱附。[GaH]2+物种负责在CH激活步骤中从烷基去除氢原子，形成传统的[HGaH]+物种。CH激活步骤（85.72 kcal/mol）的高活化能壁垒使其成为过程中的决定性步骤。

在Ga-HZSM-5中的催化位点活动更高的是位于四面体Al对附近的额外框架镓物种，并且活性可以与Al-Al距离相关联。这一发现为设计烷烃激活过程中的新型催化剂提供了见解。

[1] "An alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane. This activation leads to the formation of an alkoxide near one of the aluminum atoms, which subsequently adsorbs as an alkoxide."
[2] "In the carbenium mechanism, the activation of the CH bond and the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate occur."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond followed by desorption of the alkene and molecular hydrogen to regenerate the active site. The key steps include adsorption of propane, hydrogen removal, formation of an alkoxide near the second aluminum, and subsequent desorption of the alkene. The activation barrier for the initial CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). The alkyl mechanism applies differently to different Ga species structures, with the six-membered ring structure representing the most stable site and thus having the lowest activation barrier for CH activation.

The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves activation of the CH bond and formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate, followed by desorption of the primary alkoxide and desorption of molecular hydrogen to regenerate the active site. The CH activation step in this mechanism is also proposed as the RDS. The Al-Al distance affects the stability of the carbenium site, with smaller distances leading to lower activation barriers for CH activation but higher barriers for hydrogen removal.

The alkyl mechanism is favored by a polar environment surrounding gallium species, while the carbenium mechanism benefits from the polarity of the gallium-oxygen coordination. The competition between these two trends exemplifies the applicability of the Sabatier principle in determining the optimal Al-Al distance for maximum dehydrogenation activity.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及CH键的活化，随后是烯烃和分子氢的脱除，以再生活性位点。关键步骤包括丙烷的吸附、氢的去除、形成邻近第二个铝的醇氧，并随后脱除烯烃。初始CH活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS）。该烷基机制对不同的镓物种结构应用不同，六元环结构代表最稳定的站点，因此具有最低的CH活化壁垒。

碳正离子机制则涉及CH键的活化，形成类似醇的中间体，随后是主醇的脱除和分子氢的脱除，以再生活性位点。在这个机制中，CH活化步骤也被提议为RDS。Al-Al距离影响碳正离子站点的稳定性，较小的距离导致较低的CH活化壁垒但较高的氢脱除壁垒。

烷基机制受到围绕镓物种的极性环境的青睐，而碳正离子机制受益于镓-氧配位的极性。这两种趋势之间的竞争体现了萨巴蒂尔原理在确定最大脱氢活性的最优Al-Al距离的应用。

[1] "To carry out a consistent comparison between several dehydrogenation mechanisms, we first investigated the alkyl activation pathway proposed by Frash and van Santen [37] using a larger cluster model (11 T cluster, site I) of the catalytic site than their original work."

[2] "We find that the activation energy for initial CH activation is substantially higher (48.66 kcal/mol) compared to their previously calculated [37] value of 37.9 kcal/mol."

[3] "For the a-type site (V), we report the reaction path for carbenium activation in Fig. 7a."

[4] "We find the energy barrier for CH activation is 85.72 kcal/mol, corresponding to the initial alkane adsorption and hydrogen removal."

[5] "The other two cluster models containing two Al T sites (VI and VII), represent the g-type site according to the classification by Dedecek et al. [55]."

[6] "We find that the catalyst site is more active, like in model VII for the eight-membered ring, then the CH activation barrier is very low."

[7] "The trends in reactivity show that higher site stability, and consequently smaller AlAl distances, resulted in larger activation barriers for CH activation (85.72 kcal/mol) and lower barriers for H2 desorption and site regeneration (15.49 kcal/mol)."

[8] "This competition between two trends exemplifies the applicability of the Sabatier principle."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of the CH bond followed by the removal of hydrogen. The key steps include initial propane adsorption, hydrogen removal, and the formation of an alkene.

2. The proposed carbenium mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond to form an alkoxide intermediate, followed by the removal of hydrogen to form an alkene. The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high activation energy.

3. Different Ga species structures affect the reactivity of the PDH process. Structures with smaller Al-Al distances tend to have lower activation barriers for the CH activation step, which is beneficial for the RDS.

4. The carbenium mechanism is characterized by a higher activation barrier for the CH activation step compared to the alkyl mechanism. This is because the former requires the formation of an alkoxide intermediate, which adds an extra step to the reaction sequence.

5. Structures with two Al atoms located in an eight-membered ring exhibit higher activity than those in a six-membered ring. This is attributed to the increased stability of the [GaH]2+ species, which results in lower activation barriers for the CH activation step.

6. The optimal Al-Al distance for dehydrogenation reactions is found to be 4.53 Å, balancing the competing trends of decreasing CH activation barrier and increasing H2 removal barrier. This distance demonstrates the applicability of the Sabatier principle.

2. 提议的卡宾机制涉及活化CH键以形成醇中间体，随后是氢的去除以形成烯烃。CH活化步骤被确定为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它具有较高的活化能。

3. 不同的Ga物种结构影响PDH过程的活性。具有较小Al-Al距离的结构倾向于具有更低的CH活化步骤活化壁垒，这对RDS有利。

4. 与烷基机制相比，卡宾机制的CH活化步骤的活化壁垒更高。这是因为后者需要形成醇中间体，这增加了反应序列的额外步骤。

5. 具有两个Al原子位于八元环中的结构比六元环中的结构表现出更高的活性。这归因于[GaH]2+物种的增加稳定性，导致CH活化步骤的活化壁垒降低。

6. 脱氢反应的最佳Al-Al距离被发现为4.53 Å，平衡了减少CH活化壁垒和增加H2去除壁垒的趋势。这个距离展示了萨巴提尔原理的应用性。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a series of steps. Initially, propane is activated by the gallium species, resulting in the formation of an alkoxide-like intermediate. Subsequently, this intermediate undergoes desorption, releasing an alkene and regenerating the active site. This mechanism is compared to the carbenium mechanism, which proposes activation of the carbon-hydrogen bond followed by desorption of the alkene and hydrogen molecules. The CH activation step in the alkyl mechanism is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high activation energy required for this process. This step is facilitated by the gallium species, which removes hydrogen from the propane molecule, forming the alkoxide intermediate. Different Ga species structures, such as the a-type, g-type, and dual Al sites, are considered in the study. The a-type site is characterized by a fused six-membered ring structure, while the g-type site has an eight-membered ring configuration. The Al-Al distances for these sites vary, with the a-type site having a distance of 4.53 Å, and the g-type site having a distance of 5.53 Å. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by altering the activation energy and the efficiency of the desorption step. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, focuses on the formation of a carbenium intermediate and its subsequent desorption, leading to the production of an alkene and hydrogen molecules.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及一系列步骤。首先，丙烷通过镓物种被激活，导致形成一个醇氧化物类中间体。随后，这个中间体经历脱附，释放出烯烃并再生活性位点。与碳-氢键的活化和随后烯烃及氢分子的脱附的卡宾机制相比，烷基机制将碳-氢键活化步骤作为速率决定步骤（RDS）。由于该过程需要较高的活化能，因此碳-氢键活化步骤由镓物种促进，从丙烷分子中移除氢原子，形成醇氧化物中间体。考虑的不同Ga物种结构包括a型、g型和双铝位点。a型位点具有六元环结构特征，而g型位点具有八元环配置。这些站点的Al-Al距离不同，a型站点的距离为4.53 Å，而g型站点的距离为5.53 Å。不同的Ga物种结构通过改变活化能和脱附步骤的效率来应用烷基机制。另一方面，卡宾机制专注于形成卡宾中间体及其随后的脱附，产生烯烃和氢分子。
