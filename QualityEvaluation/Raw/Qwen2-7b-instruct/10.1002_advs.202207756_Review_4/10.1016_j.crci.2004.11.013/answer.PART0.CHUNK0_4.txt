The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. The process starts with the activation of propane, followed by the cleavage of the C-H bonds to form alkyl radicals. These alkyl radicals then undergo further reactions to form propylene and hydrogen. The carbenium mechanism, which is another common reaction pathway, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to produce propylene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most energy-intensive and time-consuming part of the reaction. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the unique properties of gallium, such as its ability to form stable complexes with hydrogen and its role in facilitating the activation and cleavage of hydrocarbon bonds.

In comparison, the carbenium mechanism relies on the formation of a more reactive intermediate, the carbenium ion, which is less stable than the alkyl radicals produced by the alkyl mechanism. This instability makes the carbenium mechanism more prone to side reactions and less efficient in terms of energy consumption. The alkyl mechanism is thus preferred for its efficiency and selectivity in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及几个关键步骤。该过程从丙烷的活化开始，随后裂解C-H键形成烷基自由基。这些烷基自由基进一步反应生成丙烯和氢气。另一种常见的反应途径是碳正离子机制，它涉及形成更活泼的中间体碳正离子，然后进行重排以产生丙烯。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它是最耗能和耗时的部分。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，通过利用镓的独特性质，如其与氢形成稳定复合物的能力及其在活化和裂解碳氢键方面的作用。

相比之下，碳正离子机制依赖于形成更活泼的中间体碳正离子，该中间体比烷基机制产生的烷基自由基不稳定。这种不稳定性使碳正离子机制更容易发生副反应，在能量消耗方面也更不高效。因此，烷基机制因其效率和选择性而更受PDH反应中镓基催化剂的青睐。
