The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane. This leads to the formation of an alkyl species, which then undergoes further reactions to produce products. The activation of the alkyl group is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This process is compared to the carbenium mechanism, which suggests an alternative pathway for alkane dehydrogenation. The alkyl mechanism is applicable to various gallium species structures, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx. The reconstructions of these gallium species under alkane dehydrogenation conditions can potentially catalyze the PDH reaction.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，通过丙烷的初始活化开始。这导致烷基物种的形成，随后进行进一步反应以产生产物。烷基组分的活化被确定为该机制的速率决定步骤（RDS）。此过程与碳正离子机制相比，后者提出了另一种烷烃脱氢的途径。烷基机制适用于各种镓物种结构，包括Ga(III)Hx、Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx和Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx。在丙烷脱氢条件下重建这些镓物种可能催化PDH反应。
