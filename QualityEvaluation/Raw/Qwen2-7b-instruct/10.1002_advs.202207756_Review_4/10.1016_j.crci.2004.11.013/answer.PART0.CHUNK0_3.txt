[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an important reaction as it constitutes the starting point in the conversion of cheap and abundant chemical compounds into valuable products."
[2] "Zeolites are microporous aluminosilicates built up by linking SiO4 tetahedra together by sharing oxygen atoms."
[3] "When aluminum substitution occurs, the resulting negative charge in excess is balanced by the introduction of cations in the micropores."
[4] "A well-known example is the exchange with ammonium ion which will leave proton as charge-compensating cat-ion after desorption of ammonia and renders a solid acid catalyst."
[5] "Gallium-exchanged zeolites allow higher dehydrogenation activities."
[6] "The details of the reaction mechanisms and the nature of the gallium active sites in these reactions are not precisely known."
[7] "For this purpose, they used as model of the gallium-exchanged zeolite catalyst a small molecular fragment within the framework of the cluster approach."
[8] "The most likely reaction sequence is depicted in Scheme 2."
[9] "One notices that the energy barrier of the rate-limiting step in this reaction pathway is particularly high."
[10] "The Int2 intermediate has been considered to be an intimately associated complex, whereas, considering the bond order in this structure it might equally be considered to be a zeolite Brnsted site on which is physisorbed a GaH3 molecule (Scheme 2)."
[11] "In the cluster approach method, activation energy barriers are generally overestimated as the zeolite framework is not described."
[12] "In this study, we will use periodic density functional theory to describe the zeolite framework as realistically as possible."
[13] "We will check different alternatives of the reconstruction of gallium-exchanged zeolite."
[14] "We select mordenite as zeolite framework because it has a small unit cell."
[15] "As previously mentioned, we selected mordenite as host structure for the gallium-cations."
[16] "In the present study, we will first consider a mordenite unit cell in which the compensating cation at the aluminum substituted tetrahedral is GaH2 +."
[17] "This system is shown in Fig. 1 and the most important geometrical parameters are reported in Table 1a."
[18] "The energy of this system is +136 kJ/mol with respect to the unreconstructed system."
[19] "The energy for this structure is +128 kJ/mol with respect to the initial unreconstructed system."
[20] "Considering this energy, spontaneous reduction of [Ga(III)H2]-MOR to Ga(I)H and H-MOR is unlikely."
[21] "The formation of H-MOR and Ga(I)H is probably prevented because of the high energy that is required to reach this structure."
[22] "The energy of this system is +215 kJ/mol with respect to [Ga(III)H2]-MOR."
[23] "The energy of this system is +164 kJ/mol, corresponding to a 50 kJ/mol stabilization of the energy with respect to its previous state."
[24] "The energy of the initial structure was used as energy reference."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, followed by the breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds, and the formation of propylene as the product. This mechanism is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it requires the highest energy barrier to proceed.

2. The carbenium mechanism typically involves the formation of a carbenium ion as the intermediate in the reaction. However, in the context of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, the focus shifts to the activation of the alkyl group, suggesting a preference for the alkyl mechanism.

3. The activation of the alkyl group (CH) is proposed as the rate-determining step because it involves the highest energy barrier among the steps involved in the PDH reaction mechanism. This is crucial for the efficiency of the catalytic process.

4. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by considering the role of gallium in facilitating the activation and subsequent cleavage of the alkyl group. The specific structure of gallium (GaH2+, GaH3, etc.) influences the stability of the intermediates and the energy required for the reaction steps.

1. 烷烃脱氢反应（PDH）在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷的活化，随后是碳-氢键的断裂，并形成丙烯作为产物。该机制被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它需要进行反应的最大能量壁垒。

2. 芳基机制通常涉及形成芳基离子作为中间体。然而，在PDH反应在镓基催化剂的背景下，焦点转向烷基组的活化，表明优先考虑烷基机制。

3. 烷基组（CH）的活化被提议为决定性步骤，因为它涉及PDH反应机制中所需能量壁垒最高的步骤。这是催化过程效率的关键。

4. 在不同的Ga物种结构下，烷基机制适用于通过考虑镓在促进烷基组活化和随后裂解的作用。镓的具体结构（GaH2+、GaH3等）影响中间体的稳定性以及所需的反应步骤的能量。
