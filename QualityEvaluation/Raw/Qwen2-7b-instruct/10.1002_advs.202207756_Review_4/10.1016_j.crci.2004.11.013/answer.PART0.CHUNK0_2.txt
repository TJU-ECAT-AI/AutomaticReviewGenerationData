The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the activation of propane leads to the formation of a carbenium ion. In the alkyl mechanism, the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high energy barrier. This activation involves the breaking of the C-H bond and the formation of an alkyl radical. The energy barrier for this step is particularly high, indicating that it is a challenging process.

The presence of gallium (Ga) species in the zeolite catalyst plays a crucial role in facilitating this mechanism. Different Ga species structures, such as GaH2+, GaH3, and Ga(I), can be reconstructed under alkane dehydrogenation conditions. These reconstructions are capable of catalyzing alkane dehydrogenation and suggest alternative reaction routes beyond those previously proposed.

In the presence of GaH3, the alkyl mechanism considers the assistance of external molecules in the reconstruction of Ga(III) dihydrate species. GaH3 can associate with GaH, leading to the formation of [GaH3·GaH] and H-MOR. This association helps in stabilizing the system and potentially facilitates further reactions. The energy of the system increases, but it remains on the same order of magnitude as the energy barriers encountered in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

Additionally, the presence of propene and hydrogen within the micropore of the zeolite framework is also considered. These molecules contribute to maintaining the reductive conditions necessary for the alkyl mechanism to proceed. The activation of propane involves the breaking of the C-H bond, followed by the formation of an alkyl radical. This step is energetically demanding and represents the rate-determining step in the PDH reaction on gallium-based catalysts.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, formation of an alkyl radical, and subsequent conversion to desired products. The rate-determining step is the activation of the CH bond, which is facilitated by gallium species in the zeolite catalyst. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism and provides insights into the catalytic activity of gallium-exchanged zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及一系列关键步骤，从丙烷激活到产物形成。与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制的特点是CH激活步骤被定为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为该步骤的能量壁垒特别高。此激活涉及C-H键的断裂和烷基自由基的形成。该步骤的能量壁垒很高，表明这是一个具有挑战性的过程。

在镓（Ga）物种作为催化剂的情况下，这些机制发挥了关键作用。不同的Ga物种结构，如GaH2+、GaH3和Ga(I)，可以在烷烃脱氢条件下重建。这些重建能够催化烷烃脱氢，并且提出了一种替代的反应路径，这超出了以前提出的路径。

在GaH3的存在下，烷基机制考虑了外部分子在Ga(III)二水合物种重建中的协助。GaH3可以与GaH结合，导致形成[GaH3·GaH]和H-MOR。这种结合有助于稳定系统，并可能促进进一步的反应。系统的能量增加，但仍然与烷烃脱氢反应中遇到的能量壁垒处于同一数量级。

此外，考虑到丙烯和氢气存在于微孔框架内的分子。这些分子有助于维持催化剂所需的还原条件，使烷基机制得以进行。丙烷的激活涉及C-H键的断裂，随后形成烷基自由基。这一步骤是具有挑战性的，并且是丙烷在镓基催化剂上脱氢反应的速率决定步骤。

综上所述，在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢的烷基机制涉及丙烷的激活、烷基自由基的形成以及随后将产物转化为所需产品的步骤。速率决定步骤是CH键的激活，由镓物种在沸石催化剂中促进。这种机制与碳正离子机制不同，并提供了关于镓交换沸石在烷烃脱氢反应中催化活性的见解。
