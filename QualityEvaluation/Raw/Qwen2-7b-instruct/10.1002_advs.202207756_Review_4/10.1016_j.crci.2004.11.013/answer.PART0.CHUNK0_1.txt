1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, followed by the formation of an alkyl radical. This radical then undergoes rearrangement to form an alkene. The key steps from initial propane activation to product formation involve the activation of the propane molecule, leading to the formation of a carbocation or an alkyl radical. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most energetically demanding step in the mechanism. This step involves the breaking of a carbon-hydrogen bond and the subsequent formation of a positively charged carbon center. This is a crucial step as it determines the overall reaction rate.

2. The carbenium mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the formation of a carbenium ion, which then undergoes isomerization to form an alkene. The key steps in this mechanism include the formation of a carbenium ion from the activated propane molecule, followed by isomerization to form an alkene. The activation of the propane molecule is the rate-determining step in this mechanism, as it involves the breaking of a carbon-hydrogen bond and the subsequent formation of a positively charged carbon center.

The alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism both involve the activation of propane, followed by the formation of an alkyl or carbenium ion. However, the alkyl mechanism involves the direct formation of an alkyl radical, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in both mechanisms, as it is the most energetically demanding step. This step involves the breaking of a carbon-hydrogen bond and the subsequent formation of a positively charged carbon center.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷的活化，随后形成烷基自由基。从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤包括丙烷分子的活化，导致形成碳正离子或烷基自由基。CH 活化步骤被提议为决定性步骤（DTS），因为它是在机制中最具能动性的步骤。这一步骤涉及断裂碳-氢键并随后形成带正电荷的碳中心。这是至关重要的步骤，因为它决定了整体反应速率。

2. 在基于镓的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，卡宾机制涉及形成卡宾离子，然后进行异构化以形成烯烃。这一机制的关键步骤包括从活化的丙烷分子形成卡宾离子，随后进行异构化以形成烯烃。丙烷分子的活化是这一机制的决定性步骤，因为它涉及断裂碳-氢键并随后形成带正电荷的碳中心。

烷基机制和卡宾机制都涉及丙烷的活化，随后形成烷基或卡宾离子。然而，烷基机制涉及直接形成烷基自由基，而卡宾机制涉及形成卡宾离子。CH 活化步骤在两种机制中都被提议为决定性步骤，因为它是最具能动性的步骤。这一步骤涉及断裂碳-氢键并随后形成带正电荷的碳中心。
