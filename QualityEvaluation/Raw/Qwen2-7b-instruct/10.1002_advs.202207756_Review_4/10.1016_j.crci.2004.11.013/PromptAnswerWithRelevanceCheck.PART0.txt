The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane. This leads to the formation of an alkyl species, which then undergoes further reactions to produce products. The activation of the alkyl group is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This process is compared to the carbenium mechanism, which suggests an alternative pathway for alkane dehydrogenation. The alkyl mechanism is applicable to various gallium species structures, including Ga(III)Hx, Ga(II)Ga(II)Hx, and Ga(III)Ga(I)Hx. The reconstructions of these gallium species under alkane dehydrogenation conditions can potentially catalyze the PDH reaction.

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, followed by the formation of an alkyl radical. This radical then undergoes rearrangement to form an alkene. The key steps from initial propane activation to product formation involve the activation of the propane molecule, leading to the formation of a carbocation or an alkyl radical. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most energetically demanding step in the mechanism. This step involves the breaking of a carbon-hydrogen bond and the subsequent formation of a positively charged carbon center. This is a crucial step as it determines the overall reaction rate.

2. The carbenium mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the formation of a carbenium ion, which then undergoes isomerization to form an alkene. The key steps in this mechanism include the formation of a carbenium ion from the activated propane molecule, followed by isomerization to form an alkene. The activation of the propane molecule is the rate-determining step in this mechanism, as it involves the breaking of a carbon-hydrogen bond and the subsequent formation of a positively charged carbon center.

The alkyl mechanism and the carbenium mechanism both involve the activation of propane, followed by the formation of an alkyl or carbenium ion. However, the alkyl mechanism involves the direct formation of an alkyl radical, while the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step in both mechanisms, as it is the most energetically demanding step. This step involves the breaking of a carbon-hydrogen bond and the subsequent formation of a positively charged carbon center.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the activation of propane leads to the formation of a carbenium ion. In the alkyl mechanism, the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high energy barrier. This activation involves the breaking of the C-H bond and the formation of an alkyl radical. The energy barrier for this step is particularly high, indicating that it is a challenging process.

The presence of gallium (Ga) species in the zeolite catalyst plays a crucial role in facilitating this mechanism. Different Ga species structures, such as GaH2+, GaH3, and Ga(I), can be reconstructed under alkane dehydrogenation conditions. These reconstructions are capable of catalyzing alkane dehydrogenation and suggest alternative reaction routes beyond those previously proposed.

In the presence of GaH3, the alkyl mechanism considers the assistance of external molecules in the reconstruction of Ga(III) dihydrate species. GaH3 can associate with GaH, leading to the formation of [GaH3·GaH] and H-MOR. This association helps in stabilizing the system and potentially facilitates further reactions. The energy of the system increases, but it remains on the same order of magnitude as the energy barriers encountered in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

Additionally, the presence of propene and hydrogen within the micropore of the zeolite framework is also considered. These molecules contribute to maintaining the reductive conditions necessary for the alkyl mechanism to proceed. The activation of propane involves the breaking of the C-H bond, followed by the formation of an alkyl radical. This step is energetically demanding and represents the rate-determining step in the PDH reaction on gallium-based catalysts.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, formation of an alkyl radical, and subsequent conversion to desired products. The rate-determining step is the activation of the CH bond, which is facilitated by gallium species in the zeolite catalyst. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism and provides insights into the catalytic activity of gallium-exchanged zeolites in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及一系列关键步骤，从丙烷激活到产物形成。与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制的特点是CH激活步骤被定为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为该步骤的能量壁垒特别高。此激活涉及C-H键的断裂和烷基自由基的形成。该步骤的能量壁垒很高，表明这是一个具有挑战性的过程。

在镓（Ga）物种作为催化剂的情况下，这些机制发挥了关键作用。不同的Ga物种结构，如GaH2+、GaH3和Ga(I)，可以在烷烃脱氢条件下重建。这些重建能够催化烷烃脱氢，并且提出了一种替代的反应路径，这超出了以前提出的路径。

在GaH3的存在下，烷基机制考虑了外部分子在Ga(III)二水合物种重建中的协助。GaH3可以与GaH结合，导致形成[GaH3·GaH]和H-MOR。这种结合有助于稳定系统，并可能促进进一步的反应。系统的能量增加，但仍然与烷烃脱氢反应中遇到的能量壁垒处于同一数量级。

此外，考虑到丙烯和氢气存在于微孔框架内的分子。这些分子有助于维持催化剂所需的还原条件，使烷基机制得以进行。丙烷的激活涉及C-H键的断裂，随后形成烷基自由基。这一步骤是具有挑战性的，并且是丙烷在镓基催化剂上脱氢反应的速率决定步骤。

综上所述，在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢的烷基机制涉及丙烷的激活、烷基自由基的形成以及随后将产物转化为所需产品的步骤。速率决定步骤是CH键的激活，由镓物种在沸石催化剂中促进。这种机制与碳正离子机制不同，并提供了关于镓交换沸石在烷烃脱氢反应中催化活性的见解。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane, followed by the breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds, and the formation of propylene as the product. This mechanism is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it requires the highest energy barrier to proceed.

3. The activation of the alkyl group (CH) is proposed as the rate-determining step because it involves the highest energy barrier among the steps involved in the PDH reaction mechanism. This is crucial for the efficiency of the catalytic process.

4. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by considering the role of gallium in facilitating the activation and subsequent cleavage of the alkyl group. The specific structure of gallium (GaH2+, GaH3, etc.) influences the stability of the intermediates and the energy required for the reaction steps.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. The process starts with the activation of propane, followed by the cleavage of the C-H bonds to form alkyl radicals. These alkyl radicals then undergo further reactions to form propylene and hydrogen. The carbenium mechanism, which is another common reaction pathway, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to produce propylene. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most energy-intensive and time-consuming part of the reaction. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the unique properties of gallium, such as its ability to form stable complexes with hydrogen and its role in facilitating the activation and cleavage of hydrocarbon bonds.

In comparison, the carbenium mechanism relies on the formation of a more reactive intermediate, the carbenium ion, which is less stable than the alkyl radicals produced by the alkyl mechanism. This instability makes the carbenium mechanism more prone to side reactions and less efficient in terms of energy consumption. The alkyl mechanism is thus preferred for its efficiency and selectivity in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及几个关键步骤。该过程从丙烷的活化开始，随后裂解C-H键形成烷基自由基。这些烷基自由基进一步反应生成丙烯和氢气。另一种常见的反应途径是碳正离子机制，它涉及形成更活泼的中间体碳正离子，然后进行重排以产生丙烯。CH激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它是最耗能和耗时的部分。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，通过利用镓的独特性质，如其与氢形成稳定复合物的能力及其在活化和裂解碳氢键方面的作用。

相比之下，碳正离子机制依赖于形成更活泼的中间体碳正离子，该中间体比烷基机制产生的烷基自由基不稳定。这种不稳定性使碳正离子机制更容易发生副反应，在能量消耗方面也更不高效。因此，烷基机制因其效率和选择性而更受PDH反应中镓基催化剂的青睐。
