[1] "McVicker et al. (87) studied the conversion of isobutane over amorphous solid acids such as SiO2-Al2O3, halided-Al2O3 as well as zeolitic materials like USY. The observed product distribution on amorphous solid acids was consistent with that expected from radical-cation intermediates, with no isomeri- zation of isobutane to n-butane occurring."
[2] "Haag and Dessau (104) in analogy with Olah (105) postulated a mechanism involving the protonation of alkanes by the solid acids."
[3] "The observed product distribution for the experimental studies shows a cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio close to 3, in other words C-C bond cleavage is found to be more facile compared to C-H bond cleavage."
[4] "Lercher et al. (131) have proposed three different carbonium-ion-like transition state structures to account for H/D exchange, protolytic cracking and protolytic dehydrogenation as shown in Figure 2."
[5] "These studies,as well as other ab initio calculations discussed later in this section, suggest that the idea of a single carbonium-ion transition state for C-H and C-C bond cleavage is perhaps an over-simplification."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves initial activation of propane, followed by sequential dehydrogenation steps. It contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which proposes the formation of a carbonium ion intermediate. The carbenium mechanism is considered less applicable here due to the lack of formation of specific carbenium ions. Instead, the alkyl mechanism is thought to operate through a series of steps that favor the cleavage of C-C bonds over C-H bonds, with the rate-determining step being the activation of the alkyl (methyl) group rather than the carbenium ion.

2. The activation step in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most significant energy barrier. This step is crucial for the subsequent dehydrogenation and cracking processes to occur efficiently. The alkyl mechanism accounts for the preferential cleavage of C-C bonds, which is observed experimentally, rather than the more straightforward cleavage of C-H bonds. This preference aligns with the energy barriers and transition states calculated in the theoretical studies.

3. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures due to the influence of the Ga dopant's location and coordination environment on the acidity and reactivity of the zeolite surface. Gallium can exist in different forms, such as Ga/Al species, Ga clusters, or Ga-doped zeolite structures, each potentially affecting the PDH reaction pathway and the rate-determining step. The specific Ga species structure influences the nature of the active sites and the strength of the interactions with the propane molecule, thus impacting the overall mechanism and the rate of PDH reactions. 

4. The mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts is characterized by a series of steps that involve the activation of propane, followed by dehydrogenation and cracking processes. The activation step, which involves the interaction of propane with the Ga dopant or the zeolite surface, is considered the rate-determining step. This step is crucial for the subsequent reactions to proceed efficiently, as it sets the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation and cracking processes.

5. The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts is influenced by the structure of the gallium species within the catalyst. Gallium can exist in various forms, including Ga/Al species, Ga clusters, or Ga-doped zeolite structures, each potentially affecting the mechanism and the rate-determining step. The specific structure of gallium within the catalyst impacts the nature of the active sites and the strength of interactions with propane, influencing the overall mechanism and the rate of dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷的初始活化，随后是逐步的脱氢步骤。它与碳正离子机制相对立，后者提出形成碳正离子中间体的概念。碳正离子机制由于没有形成特定的碳正离子而被认为不太适用。相反，烷基机制通过一系列步骤来描述，这些步骤倾向于优先裂解C-C键而不是C-H键，其中活性步骤被认定为烷基（甲基）组分的激活，而非碳正离子。

2. PDH反应中，丙烷在镓基催化剂上的活性步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到最大的能量壁垒。这个步骤对后续的脱氢和裂解过程的发生至关重要。烷基机制符合实验观察到的优先裂解C-C键的现象，而不是更直接的C-H键裂解，这与理论研究计算的能量壁垒和过渡状态相吻合。

3. PDH反应中，各种镓物种结构的影响不同，因为镓掺杂物的位置和配位环境对表面酸性和反应活性有影响。镓可以以不同的形式存在，如镓/铝物种、镓簇或镓掺杂的沸石结构，每种形式可能会影响PDH途径和决定性步骤。特定的镓物种结构影响活性位点的性质和与丙烷分子的相互作用强度，从而影响整体机制和脱氢反应的速度。

4. 铟基催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机制由一系列步骤组成，包括丙烷的活化，随后是脱氢和裂解过程。活性步骤，即与镓掺杂物或催化剂表面的相互作用，被认为是决定性步骤。这个步骤对于后续反应的有效进行至关重要，因为它设置了脱氢和裂解过程的能量壁垒。

5. 链烷基机制在镓基催化剂上对丙烷脱氢的影响取决于镓物种在催化剂中的结构。镓可以以多种形式存在，包括镓/铝物种、镓簇或镓掺杂的沸石结构，每种形式都可能影响机制和决定性步骤。特定的镓物种结构影响活性位点的性质和与丙烷分子的相互作用强度，从而影响整体机制和脱氢反应的速度。
