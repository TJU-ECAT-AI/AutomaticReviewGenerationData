[1] "The Haag-Dessau mechanism for protolytic activation of the alkane via penta-coordinated carbonium-ion-like transition states explains the observed product distribution."
[2] "We extend that discussion here and focus only on the olefin adsorption studies."
[3] "The observed perturbations were attributed to the formation of a 1:1 p-complex as shown in Figure 5."
[4] "The short term oligomerization data showed the appearance of characteristic modes of CH3 and CH2 saturated groups, indicating that protonation and polymerization processes have occurred."
[5] "At longer times on stream, oligomeric products with branched chains could also be discerned."
[6] "Although these studies cannot directly examine the nature of the surface"
[7] "Following the initial pioneering work from Kazansky and coworkers, a number of ab initio studies have addressed the protonation of olefinic molecules in zeolites."
[8] "The formation of the covalent C-O bond was hindered due to enforced structural constraints of the rigid zeolite lattice, and hence, the authors cautioned against comparing adsorption energies on structurally different zeolites."
[9] "We report a novel reaction path for propene chemisorption,whereby the primary alkoxide is bonded to the Brnsted host oxygen rather than a neighboring lattice oxygen."
[10] "The product distribution for hexene and heptene was found to be independent of the particular olefin fed, indicating that isomerization was rapid compared to cracking."
[11] "The major features of the observed product distribution for the b-scission reaction can be described in terms of carbenium ion chemistry."
[12] "We note that each of the theoretical studies described above was done on clusters that did not specifically mimic any particular zeolite lattice structure, hence, local relaxation effects that have been shown to have a significant effect on the energy of the adsorbed alkoxide intermediate, may also significantly alter the energy profile for the b-scission and oligomerization reactions."
[13] "We have examined three pathways for cyclization of the gas phase C6H11 carbenium ion species shown in Figure 9."
[14] "Most of the evidence for these mechanisms is derived from fitting kinetic models for the observed product distribution, however, rigorous interpretation of the kinetics is difficult due to concurrent coking and deactivation, and hence time on stream dependence of the observed kinetics."
[15] "The intrinsic activation barrier calculated for mono- molecular cracking for n-hexane was calculated from data at low conversions"
[16] "The authors noted an increase in catalytic activity when the Si/Al ratio decreased from 21.5 to 35.25 and attribute this to enhanced acidity, however; this explanation contradicts observations from several other experimental studies wherein no acidity change is observed with Si/Al ratio."
[17] "Individual H and Ga sites were considered and individual site balances written for each site, however, it is not apparent whether each gallium site was considered to compensate for an H site as will be evident from our discussion in Section 4.3."
[18] "Gallium sites were calculated to result in the formation of 90% of the dienes and 50% of the aromatic molecules for propane aromatization."
[19] "Both these observations are in close agreement with the work of Kwak et al. (117)."
[20] "We obtain a quantitative description of these data at various conversions and obtain tight bounds on all the energetic parameters."
