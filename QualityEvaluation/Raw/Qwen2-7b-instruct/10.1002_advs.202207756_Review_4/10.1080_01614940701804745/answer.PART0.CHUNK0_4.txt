[1] "Since the publication of the Haag-Dessau mechanism, there was significant dispute in the literature, with McVicker and Kramer (108) arguing that the constancy of the [H2  C4 olefins] to [CH4  C3H8] ratio over non-zeolitic catalysts having a wide range of activity was difficult to reconcile."
[2] "In a series of studies, researchers (132134) have used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5. 13C tracer studies of propane-2-13C gave a product distribution containing a random number of 13C atoms, thereby suggesting that several oligomerization-cracking cycles were part of a single catalytic turnover."
[3] "The apparent activation energies obtained for the exchange of methyl groups (108 + 7 kJ/mol) and methylene groups (117 + 7 kJ/mol) are in good agreement with computational studies (147)."
[4] "Using the method described by Kramer and van Santen (18) to vary acidity by varying terminal Si-H bond lengths, the authors compared the ionicity of the transition state structures described above."

1. McVicker and Kramer (108) disputed the Haag-Dessau mechanism due to the inconsistent [H2  C4 olefins] to [CH4  C3H8] ratio over non-zeolitic catalysts with varying activities.
2. Researchers used 13C isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5, indicating that multiple cycles of oligomerization and cracking occurred during a single catalytic turnover.
3. The activation energies for the exchange of methyl and methylene groups, calculated as 108 + 7 kJ/mol and 117 + 7 kJ/mol respectively, matched well with computational studies.
4. By altering the terminal Si-H bond lengths to adjust acidity, Kramer and van Santen (18) compared the ionicity of the transition state structures.

1. McVicker和Kramer (108)质疑Haag-Dessau机制，因为非沸石催化剂活性范围广泛时，[H2  C4烯烃]与[CH4  C3H8]的比例不一致。
2. 研究人员使用13C同位素示踪技术研究丙烷在HZSM-5上的活化，表明一个催化转录周期包含多次寡聚化和裂解循环。
3. 计算出的甲基和亚甲基组分的活化能分别为108 + 7 kJ/mol和117 + 7 kJ/mol，与计算研究结果相符。
4. 克拉默和van Santen (18)通过改变终端Si-H键长调整酸性，并比较了上述过渡态结构的离子性。
