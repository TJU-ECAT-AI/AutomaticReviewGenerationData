[1] "The observed product distribution for the experimental studies shows a cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio close to 3, in other words C-C bond cleavage is found to be more facile compared to C-H bond cleavage."
[2] "The calculated virtual pressure of hydrogen, considering that the dissociation of H2 leads to one H-atom that is mobile on HZSM-5, was calculated to be 216 kPa, while the gas phase pressure was less than 1 kPa."
[3] "Since, the ratio observed was identical for the two isotopic switching events shown in Eq. (2), the authors concluded that cleavage of the O-H bond of the zeolite was rate limiting for the cracking reaction."
[4] "The initial rate of scrambling was found to correlate with the concentration and strength of Brnsted sites while no correlation with the concentration of Lewis acid sites was observed."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane at the Brnsted acid sites of the catalyst. The mechanism is characterized by the cleavage of C-H bonds, followed by the formation of an alkyl cation intermediate. This alkyl cation then reacts with other propane molecules, leading to the formation of alkenes and further alkyl cations. The rate-determining step (RDS) is proposed to be the activation of the alkyl cation, which involves its interaction with the Brnsted acid site. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which postulates the formation of a carbonium ion transition state during the dehydrogenation process. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the Ga species enhances the acidity of the Brnsted acid sites, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The activation of the alkyl cation is considered to be the rate-limiting step due to the high energy barrier associated with this step.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷在镓基催化剂的Brnsted酸位点的初始活化。该机制以C-H键的断裂为特点，随后形成烷基阳离子中间体。这个烷基阳离子与其它丙烷分子反应，导致烯烃的生成和进一步的烷基阳离子的形成。脱氢过程的决速步骤（RDS）被提出是烷基阳离子的活化，涉及到它与Brnsted酸位点的相互作用。该机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者的假设是在脱氢过程中形成碳正离子过渡态。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，因为Ga物种增强了Brnsted酸位点的酸性，促进了脱氢过程。烷基阳离子的活化被认为是最关键的步骤，因为它伴随着较高的能量壁垒。
