[1] "The observed product distribution for the experimental studies shows a cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio close to 3, in other words C-C bond cleavage is found to be more facile compared to C-H bond cleavage."
[2] "The calculated virtual pressure of hydrogen, considering that the dissociation of H2 leads to one H-atom that is mobile on HZSM-5, was calculated to be 216 kPa, while the gas phase pressure was less than 1 kPa. Hence, the authors concluded that recombinative desorption of hydrogen limits alkane aromatization on HZSM-5."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a series of steps starting from the activation of propane. The key steps are as follows:

1. Propane binds to the gallium site on the catalyst surface.
2. Propane undergoes dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of a propane radical cation.
3. The radical cation collapses into a propane alkoxide, which is the active intermediate.
4. The alkoxide intermediate undergoes C-C bond cleavage to form propene and hydrogen.
5. The hydrogen atom is then reabsorbed by the gallium site, allowing the process to regenerate and repeat.

This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where a carbenium ion is believed to form as the active intermediate. The carbenium mechanism is characterized by the formation of a positively charged intermediate that collapses into a smaller alkene and alkane.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves the breaking of the C-H bond, which is a crucial step in the dehydrogenation process. This step is rate-limiting due to the strong interaction between the propane molecule and the gallium site, requiring sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different gallium species structures by utilizing the gallium site as the active site for both dehydrogenation and hydrogen absorption. The gallium site provides the necessary acidity to protonate the propane molecule and stabilize the resulting alkoxide intermediate. The regeneration of the gallium site allows the mechanism to proceed efficiently, facilitating the continuous cycle of propane activation and product formation.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及一系列步骤，从丙烷的催化剂表面激活开始。关键步骤如下：

1. 丙烷结合到催化剂表面的镓位点上。
2. 丙烷经历脱氢作用，形成丙烷正离子自由基。
3. 正离子自由基塌缩为丙烷醇，这是活性中间体。
4. 醇中间体进行C-C键断裂，形成丙烯和氢气。
5. 氢原子随后被镓位点重新吸收，允许过程再生并重复。

与碳正离子机制相比，这种机制以形成活性中间体的方式进行丙烷脱氢。碳正离子机制以形成带正电的中间体为特征，该中间体塌缩为较小的烯烃和烷烃。

CH激活步骤被认为是速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到C-H键的断裂，这是脱氢过程的关键步骤。这个步骤是率限制性的，因为丙烷分子与镓位点之间的强相互作用需要足够的能量来克服活化壁垒。

对于不同的镓物种结构，烷基机制通过利用镓位点作为脱氢和氢吸收的活性位点来应用。镓位点提供了必要的酸性，以质子化丙烷分子并稳定形成的丙烷醇中间体。镓位点的再生使机制得以高效进行，促进丙烷激活和产物形成的过程连续性。
