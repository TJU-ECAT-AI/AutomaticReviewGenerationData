[1] "The Haag-Dessau mechanism for protolytic activation of the alkane via penta-coordinated carbonium-ion-like transition states explains the observed product distribution."
[2] "The major features of the observed product distribution for the b-scission reaction can be described in terms of carbenium ion chemistry."
[3] "We note that due to the much higher heat of adsorption on H-MOR and H-BEA, the composite activation barriers are lower for b-scission and hydride transfer reactions,even though the intrinsic activation energies are higher."
[4] "Good quantitative agreement between model predictions and the experimental data are obtained based on 30 rate constants for olefin aromatization and an additional 14 rate constants for paraffin aromatization."
[5] "The introduction of gallium was observed to increase the dehy- drogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, while the protolytic cracking rate was not observed to be significantly altered."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane is activated via a carbonium-ion-like transition state, leading to the formation of an alkyl cation. This alkyl cation then undergoes further reactions, including bimolecular reactions, to form products. The activation of propane is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its critical role in initiating the PDH process. The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion during the dehydrogenation process. In gallium-based catalysts, the addition of gallium increases the dehydrogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. The high heat of adsorption on materials like H-MOR and H-BEA leads to lower composite activation barriers for reactions like b-scission and hydride transfer, despite higher intrinsic activation energies. A detailed model for propane aromatization on HZSM-5 catalysts has been developed, providing quantitative descriptions of the reaction data at various conversions.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，通过五配位碳离子过渡态激活烷烃，解释了观察到的产品分布。首先，丙烷通过碳离子类似物过渡状态被激活，形成烷基正离子。随后，该烷基正离子进行进一步反应，包括二分子反应，生成产物。激活丙烷被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它在启动PDH过程中的关键作用。与形成碳正离子的碳正离子机制不同，烷基机制涉及在催化剂如H-MOR和H-BEA上的高吸附热导致较低的复合活化能壁垒，尽管内在活化能更高。在镓基催化剂中，添加镓将脱氢速率常数提高7倍，增强催化剂的效率。材料如H-MOR和H-BEA上较高的吸附热导致b断裂和氢转移反应的较低复合活化能壁垒，尽管内在活化能较高。对于HZSM-5催化剂的丙烷芳构化详细模型已被开发，提供了各种转化率下反应数据的定量描述。
