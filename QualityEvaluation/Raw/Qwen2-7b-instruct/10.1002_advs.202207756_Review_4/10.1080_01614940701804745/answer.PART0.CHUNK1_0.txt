[1] "The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane to form an alkyl species, which then undergoes dehydrogenation to form propene."
[2] "The activation of propane to form an alkyl species is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts."
[3] "The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that the alkyl mechanism involves the direct activation of propane to form an alkyl species, which then undergoes dehydrogenation, whereas the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate."
[4] "The reason for proposing the activation of propane to form an alkyl species as the RDS is that it is a fast and efficient process, which leads to the formation of propene in a single step."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts begins with the activation of propane to form an alkyl species, which then undergoes dehydrogenation to produce propene. Activation of propane to form an alkyl species is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its efficiency and speed, leading to the formation of propene in a single step. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. The direct activation of propane to an alkyl species is the RDS because it is a fast and efficient process.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，镓基催化剂上的烷基机制始于丙烷的活化形成烷基物种，然后发生脱氢生成丙烯。激活丙烷形成烷基物种被确定为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它是一个快速且高效的过程，导致在一步中形成丙烯。这一机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及形成碳正离子中间体。直接激活丙烷到烷基物种是RDS，因为这是一个快速和高效的过程。
