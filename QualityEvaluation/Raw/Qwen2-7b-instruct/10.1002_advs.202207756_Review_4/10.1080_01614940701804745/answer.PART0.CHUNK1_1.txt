[1] "Our model considers surface species to be neutral alkoxides, reactions of these alkoxides to occur via carbenium-ion-like transition states and alkane activation via carbonium-ion-like transition states."
[2] "The authors find that diene formation via hydrogen-transfer steps on Brnsted acid sites was rate limiting, however, only relative rate constant values were presented in this study."
[3] "Good quantitative agreement between model predictions and the experimental data are obtained based on 30 rate constants for olefin aromatization and an additional 14 rate constants for paraffin aromatization."
[4] "The introduction of gallium was observed to increase the dehy- drogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, while the protolytic cracking rate was not observed to be significantly altered."
[5] "Our model acknowledges the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption energetics, considers the existence of methoxy surface species, includes alkylation reactions as discussed in Section 3.1.4, as well as postulates the elementary steps for cyclization and subsequent aromatization by hydride abstraction reactions."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane through a carbonium-ion-like transition state. This leads to the formation of alkyl species, which then undergo a series of reactions including hydrogen abstraction, alkylation, and cyclization to form aromatics. The key steps include the activation of propane, the formation of alkyl radicals, the abstraction of hydrogen to form alkyl radicals, the alkylation of aromatic rings, and the cyclization of alkyl species to produce aromatics. The activation step of propane is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, where the activation involves the formation of a carbenium ion. The introduction of gallium enhances the dehydrogenation rate by a factor of 7, but does not significantly affect the protolytic cracking rate. Our model considers the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption energetics, acknowledges the existence of methoxy surface species, and postulates the elementary steps for cyclization and subsequent aromatization by hydride abstraction reactions.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷的初始通过碳正离子型过渡状态激活。这导致烷基物种的形成，然后进行一系列反应包括氢提取、烷基化和环化以形成芳香族化合物。关键步骤包括丙烷的活化、烷基自由基的形成、氢提取形成烷基自由基、芳香环的烷基化以及烷基物种的环化以产生芳香族化合物。激活步骤被认为是该机制的速率决定步骤（RDS）。烷基机制与碳正离子机制不同，其中的激活涉及形成碳正离子。镓的引入将脱氢化速率提高7倍，但对裂解速率影响不大。我们的模型考虑了烷烃吸附能性的碳数依赖性，承认甲氧基表面物种的存在，并假设了环化和随后通过氢提取反应形成芳香族化合物的基本步骤。
