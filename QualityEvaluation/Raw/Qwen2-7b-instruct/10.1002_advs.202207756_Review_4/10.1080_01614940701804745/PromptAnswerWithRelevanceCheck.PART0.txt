The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane through a carbonium-ion-like transition state. This leads to the formation of alkyl species, which then undergo a series of reactions including hydrogen abstraction, alkylation, and cyclization to form aromatics. The key steps include the activation of propane, the formation of alkyl radicals, the abstraction of hydrogen to form alkyl radicals, the alkylation of aromatic rings, and the cyclization of alkyl species to produce aromatics. The activation step of propane is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, where the activation involves the formation of a carbenium ion. The introduction of gallium enhances the dehydrogenation rate by a factor of 7, but does not significantly affect the protolytic cracking rate. Our model considers the carbon number dependence of alkane adsorption energetics, acknowledges the existence of methoxy surface species, and postulates the elementary steps for cyclization and subsequent aromatization by hydride abstraction reactions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane at the Brnsted acid sites of the catalyst. The mechanism is characterized by the cleavage of C-H bonds, followed by the formation of an alkyl cation intermediate. This alkyl cation then reacts with other propane molecules, leading to the formation of alkenes and further alkyl cations. The rate-determining step (RDS) is proposed to be the activation of the alkyl cation, which involves its interaction with the Brnsted acid site. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which postulates the formation of a carbonium ion transition state during the dehydrogenation process. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the Ga species enhances the acidity of the Brnsted acid sites, facilitating the dehydrogenation process. The activation of the alkyl cation is considered to be the rate-limiting step due to the high energy barrier associated with this step.

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves initial activation of propane, followed by sequential dehydrogenation steps. It contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which proposes the formation of a carbonium ion intermediate. The carbenium mechanism is considered less applicable here due to the lack of formation of specific carbenium ions. Instead, the alkyl mechanism is thought to operate through a series of steps that favor the cleavage of C-C bonds over C-H bonds, with the rate-determining step being the activation of the alkyl (methyl) group rather than the carbenium ion.

2. The activation step in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most significant energy barrier. This step is crucial for the subsequent dehydrogenation and cracking processes to occur efficiently. The alkyl mechanism accounts for the preferential cleavage of C-C bonds, which is observed experimentally, rather than the more straightforward cleavage of C-H bonds. This preference aligns with the energy barriers and transition states calculated in the theoretical studies.

3. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures due to the influence of the Ga dopant's location and coordination environment on the acidity and reactivity of the zeolite surface. Gallium can exist in different forms, such as Ga/Al species, Ga clusters, or Ga-doped zeolite structures, each potentially affecting the PDH reaction pathway and the rate-determining step. The specific Ga species structure influences the nature of the active sites and the strength of the interactions with the propane molecule, thus impacting the overall mechanism and the rate of PDH reactions. 

4. The mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts is characterized by a series of steps that involve the activation of propane, followed by dehydrogenation and cracking processes. The activation step, which involves the interaction of propane with the Ga dopant or the zeolite surface, is considered the rate-determining step. This step is crucial for the subsequent reactions to proceed efficiently, as it sets the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation and cracking processes.

5. The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts is influenced by the structure of the gallium species within the catalyst. Gallium can exist in various forms, including Ga/Al species, Ga clusters, or Ga-doped zeolite structures, each potentially affecting the mechanism and the rate-determining step. The specific structure of gallium within the catalyst impacts the nature of the active sites and the strength of interactions with propane, influencing the overall mechanism and the rate of dehydrogenation reactions.

3. PDH反应中，各种镓物种结构的影响不同，因为镓掺杂物的位置和配位环境对表面酸性和反应活性有影响。镓可以以不同的形式存在，如镓/铝物种、镓簇或镓掺杂的沸石结构，每种形式可能会影响PDH途径和决定性步骤。特定的镓物种结构影响活性位点的性质和与丙烷分子的相互作用强度，从而影响整体机制和脱氢反应的速度。

4. 铟基催化剂上丙烷脱氢的机制由一系列步骤组成，包括丙烷的活化，随后是脱氢和裂解过程。活性步骤，即与镓掺杂物或催化剂表面的相互作用，被认为是决定性步骤。这个步骤对于后续反应的有效进行至关重要，因为它设置了脱氢和裂解过程的能量壁垒。

5. 链烷基机制在镓基催化剂上对丙烷脱氢的影响取决于镓物种在催化剂中的结构。镓可以以多种形式存在，包括镓/铝物种、镓簇或镓掺杂的沸石结构，每种形式都可能影响机制和决定性步骤。特定的镓物种结构影响活性位点的性质和与丙烷分子的相互作用强度，从而影响整体机制和脱氢反应的速度。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane is activated via a carbonium-ion-like transition state, leading to the formation of an alkyl cation. This alkyl cation then undergoes further reactions, including bimolecular reactions, to form products. The activation of propane is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its critical role in initiating the PDH process. The alkyl mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion during the dehydrogenation process. In gallium-based catalysts, the addition of gallium increases the dehydrogenation rate constant by a factor of 7, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency. The high heat of adsorption on materials like H-MOR and H-BEA leads to lower composite activation barriers for reactions like b-scission and hydride transfer, despite higher intrinsic activation energies. A detailed model for propane aromatization on HZSM-5 catalysts has been developed, providing quantitative descriptions of the reaction data at various conversions.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a series of steps starting from the activation of propane. The key steps are as follows:

1. Propane binds to the gallium site on the catalyst surface.
2. Propane undergoes dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of a propane radical cation.
3. The radical cation collapses into a propane alkoxide, which is the active intermediate.
4. The alkoxide intermediate undergoes C-C bond cleavage to form propene and hydrogen.
5. The hydrogen atom is then reabsorbed by the gallium site, allowing the process to regenerate and repeat.

This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where a carbenium ion is believed to form as the active intermediate. The carbenium mechanism is characterized by the formation of a positively charged intermediate that collapses into a smaller alkene and alkane.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves the breaking of the C-H bond, which is a crucial step in the dehydrogenation process. This step is rate-limiting due to the strong interaction between the propane molecule and the gallium site, requiring sufficient energy to overcome the activation barrier.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different gallium species structures by utilizing the gallium site as the active site for both dehydrogenation and hydrogen absorption. The gallium site provides the necessary acidity to protonate the propane molecule and stabilize the resulting alkoxide intermediate. The regeneration of the gallium site allows the mechanism to proceed efficiently, facilitating the continuous cycle of propane activation and product formation.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及一系列步骤，从丙烷的催化剂表面激活开始。关键步骤如下：

1. 丙烷结合到催化剂表面的镓位点上。
2. 丙烷经历脱氢作用，形成丙烷正离子自由基。
3. 正离子自由基塌缩为丙烷醇，这是活性中间体。
4. 醇中间体进行C-C键断裂，形成丙烯和氢气。
5. 氢原子随后被镓位点重新吸收，允许过程再生并重复。

与碳正离子机制相比，这种机制以形成活性中间体的方式进行丙烷脱氢。碳正离子机制以形成带正电的中间体为特征，该中间体塌缩为较小的烯烃和烷烃。

CH激活步骤被认为是速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到C-H键的断裂，这是脱氢过程的关键步骤。这个步骤是率限制性的，因为丙烷分子与镓位点之间的强相互作用需要足够的能量来克服活化壁垒。

对于不同的镓物种结构，烷基机制通过利用镓位点作为脱氢和氢吸收的活性位点来应用。镓位点提供了必要的酸性，以质子化丙烷分子并稳定形成的丙烷醇中间体。镓位点的再生使机制得以高效进行，促进丙烷激活和产物形成的过程连续性。

1. Propane is activated on the Brönsted acid sites of the gallium-containing catalyst, leading to the formation of an alkyl species. This activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it controls the overall reaction rate.

2. The alkyl species then reacts with other alkyl or aromatic species on the surface to form larger alkylated products. This alkylation step is facilitated by the presence of gallium species on the catalyst surface, which enhances the dehydrogenation function.

3. Hydrogen transfer reactions occur, allowing for the formation of aromatic products through the abstraction of hydrogen from the alkylated species.

4. Cyclization reactions take place, converting the alkylated species into aromatic compounds via the formation of a cyclic intermediate.

The alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the initial step involves the formation of a carbenium ion. The choice between these mechanisms depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions.

In gallium-based catalysts, the CH activation step is proposed as the RDS because it controls the overall rate of the PDH reaction. The presence of gallium facilitates this activation step, enhancing the dehydrogenation function of the catalyst.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures, as the location and interaction of gallium species affect the reaction pathways and rates. The specific structure of gallium species influences the efficiency of the activation step and the subsequent reactions, impacting the yield and selectivity of the desired aromatic products.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及丙烷在镓基催化剂上的初始活化，导致形成烷基物种。然后，该烷基物种通过一系列反应，包括烷基化、氢转移和环化，形成芳香族产物。从激活到产品形成的关键步骤如下：

1. 丙烷在催化剂表面的Brönsted酸位点上被活化，导致形成烷基物种。激活步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它控制着整个反应速率。

2. 然后，烷基物种与表面的其他烷基或芳香族物种反应，形成更大的烷基化产物。这个烷基化步骤由催化剂表面上的镓物种促进，增强脱氢功能。

3. 发生氢转移反应，允许通过从烷基化物种中提取氢来形成芳香族产物。

4. 发生环化反应，通过形成环状中间体将烷基化物种转化为芳香化合物。

烷基机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及最初形成碳正离子。这些机制的选择取决于特定的催化剂和反应条件。

在镓基催化剂中，CH激活步骤被提议为RDS，因为它控制着PDH反应的整体速率。镓的存在促进了这一激活步骤，增强了催化剂的脱氢功能。

不同的镓物种结构对烷基机制的应用产生影响，因为镓物种的位置和相互作用影响反应路径和速率。特定的镓物种结构影响激活步骤的效率和后续反应，从而影响所需芳香族产品的产率和选择性。

[1] "Since the publication of the Haag-Dessau mechanism, there was significant dispute in the literature, with McVicker and Kramer (108) arguing that the constancy of the [H2  C4 olefins] to [CH4  C3H8] ratio over non-zeolitic catalysts having a wide range of activity was difficult to reconcile."
[2] "In a series of studies, researchers (132134) have used isotopic tracer techniques to study propane activation on HZSM-5. 13C tracer studies of propane-2-13C gave a product distribution containing a random number of 13C atoms, thereby suggesting that several oligomerization-cracking cycles were part of a single catalytic turnover."
[3] "The apparent activation energies obtained for the exchange of methyl groups (108 + 7 kJ/mol) and methylene groups (117 + 7 kJ/mol) are in good agreement with computational studies (147)."
[4] "Using the method described by Kramer and van Santen (18) to vary acidity by varying terminal Si-H bond lengths, the authors compared the ionicity of the transition state structures described above."
