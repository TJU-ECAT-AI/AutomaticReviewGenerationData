Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts is a process that involves the polarization of the CH bond in propane, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which involves the polarization of the CH bond in a way that creates a positive partial charge on the carbon atom and a negative partial charge on the hydrogen atom. 

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is because the activation of the CH bond is a critical step that leads to the formation of the alkyl intermediate, which then undergoes further transformations to produce the desired products. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism typically involves a higher activation energy barrier for the CH activation step.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various gallium species structures. For instance, the stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species varies depending on the ring structure. In the S5a ring, the species is less stable, making alkyl activation more difficult compared to the Z4a ring. Despite this, the overall free energy of alkyl activation is lower than that of the carbenium activation. This indicates that the alkyl mechanism can be more energetically favorable under certain conditions.

The alkyl mechanism involves the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, which leaves behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The free energy barriers for this ethene removal step are typically higher than those encountered in the carbenium mechanism, suggesting that the alkene removal step might be a rate-limiting factor in the alkyl mechanism.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts is characterized by the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates through a series of steps, including CH activation, alkene removal, and hydrogen desorption. While the overall activation energy is lower compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkene removal step poses a challenge that might affect the overall efficiency of the process.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，以镓为基础的催化剂上是通过丙烷中CH键的极化形成金属-烷基（MCnH2n+1）和Brnsted酸作为中间体的过程。这与碳正电荷和氢负电荷形成的卡宾机制形成对比。

CH激活步骤被提议为烷基机制中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为它是一个关键步骤，导致形成烷基中间体，然后进一步转化以产生所需的产品。相比之下，卡宾机制通常具有更高的CH激活能量壁垒。

烷基机制在不同镓物种结构下应用有所不同。例如，二价镓单羟基物种在不同的环结构中稳定性不同。在S5a环中，物种较不稳定，使得烷基激活比Z4a环更困难。尽管如此，烷基激活的整体自由能仍然低于卡宾激活。这表明在某些条件下，烷基机制可能更加有利。

烷基机制涉及从Ga烷基中间体脱除烯烃（乙烯），留下二价镓氢化物物种([GaH2]+Z m)。乙烯脱除步骤的自由能壁垒通常高于卡宾机制，暗示乙烯脱除步骤可能是烷基机制中限制效率的因素之一。

总之，烷基机制在以镓为基础的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应中，通过一系列步骤形成金属-烷基中间体，包括CH激活、烯烃去除和氢脱附。虽然整体激活能较低，但烯烃脱除步骤可能会对过程的整体效率造成挑战。
