[1] "We have used electronic DFT and thermochemical analysis to study the dehydrogenation mechanism catalyzed by [GaH]2+Z2 d sites in the Ga/H-ZSM-5. We have studied two different reaction paths for ethane dehydrogenation using pair Al sites."
[2] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
[3] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium activation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation, compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
[4] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
[5] "The overall activation energy (AG0 a) for alkyl activation is lower than the carbenium activation, suggesting that alkyl activation might be the preferred pathway."
[6] "The balance between activity and stability exemplifies the Sabatier principle for zeolite catalysis."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the opening of the GaO coordination to form an activated intermediate, followed by the activation of the CH bond and desorption of the alkene product. It contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the CH bond is polarized towards forming a carbocation intermediate.

2. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves the most energy-intensive transformation, which limits the overall reaction rate.

3. Different Ga species structures impact the alkyl mechanism by affecting the stability of the GaH species and the ease of CH bond activation. Structures with larger Al-Al distances generally exhibit lower stability and higher activation barriers for the alkyl mechanism.

4. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures due to variations in the stability and coordination of the GaH species. Structures like S6a and S6b, with larger Al-Al distances, show higher activation barriers for the alkyl mechanism compared to Z4a and Z8a structures.

5. The Sabatier principle, which advocates for an optimal balance between activity and stability, is demonstrated in the alkyl mechanism. Structures with larger Al-Al distances tend to have lower stability, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on stability for activity.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及打开GaO协调以形成活化中间体，然后是CH键的激活和烯烃产物的脱附。与碳正离子机制相比，它涉及到更复杂的转化步骤。

2. 烷基机制中的CH活化步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到能量最密集的转换，限制了整个反应速率。

3. 不同的Ga物种结构影响烷基机制，通过影响GaH物种的稳定性以及CH键激活的难度。较大的Al-Al距离通常会导致更低的稳定性以及更高的烷基机制的活化壁垒。

4. 烷基机制在不同的Ga物种结构中应用有所不同，由于稳定性以及GaH物种的配位方式的差异。例如，S6a和S6b结构与Z4a和Z8a结构相比，较大的Al-Al距离导致更高的烷基机制的活化壁垒。

5. Sabatier原理强调活动性和稳定性的平衡，烷基机制展示了这一点。较大的Al-Al距离倾向于降低稳定性，这与原理强调稳定性促进活性相一致。
