Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

Through a full thermochemical analysis at reaction conditions, we studied ethane dehydrogenation activity of extra-framework [GaH]2+ species in Ga/H-[Al]ZSM-5 at the 631g(d,p)/B3LYP level. We provide a theoretical evidence to support the proposition of [GaH]+ near-pair framework Al sites as being the active catalytic sites for ethane dehydrogenation. Dehydrogenation activity is governed by the reducibility of [GaH]2+Z2 d site in the presence of H2, which is largely dependent on a zeolite ring structure consisting of two framework Al atoms. The optimum sites are defined by the intersection of linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relations between the activation energy of the structure sensitive steps and enthalpy of reduction for the catalytic site. A comparison of the carbenium and alkyl activation mechanism indicates that the activity of the alkyl activation mechanism will be limited by the removal of highly activated (Eact 5560 kcal/mol) ethene from [HGaC2H5]+ species. Our thermochemical analysis also indicates that at higher temperatures, the pairAl sites with larger AlAl distances become more prevalent, increasing the number of optimum catalytic sites. This work suggests a potential optimal Si/Al ratio for a given Ga loading.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane through a CH bond polarization leading to the formation of a metal alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. This is contrasted with the carbenium activation mechanism, where the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol for ethene removal from Gaalkyl species, making this step the limiting factor in the catalytic cycle. This mechanism applies differently to various gallium species structures, as the stability and coordination of the monohydride species affect the activation barriers and thus the efficiency of the PDH reaction. The analysis suggests that at higher temperatures, sites with larger Al-Al distances are more prevalent, increasing the number of active catalytic sites. This implies a potential optimal Si/Al ratio for a given gallium loading to enhance PDH activity.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及通过CH键极化初步激活丙烷，形成金属烷基（MCnH2n+1）和Brnsted酸作为中间体。这与卡宾机制形成对比，在卡宾机制中，碳原子呈现正部分电荷，而氢呈现负部分电荷。CH活化步骤被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），因为从Ga烷基物种去除乙烯的激活壁垒约为60 kcal/mol，使该步骤成为催化循环的限制因素。这一机制对不同的镓物种结构有不同的应用，因为单羟基物种的稳定性和配位影响激活壁垒并因此影响PDH反应的效率。分析表明，在较高温度下，具有较大Al-Al距离的站点更普遍，增加了活性催化站点的数量。这意味着存在潜在的Si/Al比率，对于给定的镓负载可以增强PDH活性。

For the S6a structure there are at least 4 distinct reduction products (see Fig. 2a), each of these products differs in terms of the coordination of the Brnsted proton and the [GaH2]+ species. The heats of reaction for het- erolytic addition of the hydrogen across GaO22, GaO11 coordinations (see Fig. 2a) were 27.9 and 30.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The highly endothermic heat of reduction (H 0 red) suggests that the site is very stable in the monohydride form.
