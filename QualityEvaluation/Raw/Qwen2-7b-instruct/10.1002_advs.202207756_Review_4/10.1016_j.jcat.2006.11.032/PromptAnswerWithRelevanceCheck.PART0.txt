Through a full thermochemical analysis at reaction conditions, we studied ethane dehydrogenation activity of extra-framework [GaH]2+ species in Ga/H-[Al]ZSM-5 at the 631g(d,p)/B3LYP level. We provide a theoretical evidence to support the proposition of [GaH]+ near-pair framework Al sites as being the active catalytic sites for ethane dehydrogenation. 

Dehydrogenation activity is governed by the reducibility of [GaH]2+Z2 d site in the presence of H2, which is largely dependent on a zeolite ring structure consisting of two framework Al atoms. 

The optimal sites are defined by the intersection of linear BrnstedEvansPolanyi relations between the activation energy of the structure sensitive steps and enthalpy of reduction for the catalytic site. 

A comparison of the carbenium and alkyl activation mechanism indicates that the activity of the alkyl activation mechanism will be limited by the removal of highly activated (Eact 5560 kcal/mol) ethene from [HGaC2H5]+ species. 

Our thermochemical analysis also indicates that at higher temperatures, the pairAl sites with larger AlAl distances become more prevalent, increasing the number of optimum catalytic sites.

2. Details of the calculations
2.1. Cluster models

For each cluster, a charge-compensating [GaH]2+ species was placed between the two tetrahedral framework Al. 

[GaH]2+Z2 d + H2(g) [GaH2]+Z mH+Z m.

To compare all of these catalytic site structures, we envision a simple reduction of the catalytic site as shown by reaction (1).

Carbenium activation involves CH bond polarization in such a way that the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge (δ+) and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge (δ). Carbenium activation leads to the formation of alkoxide and metal hydride (MH) as an intermediate.

In contrast, alkyl activation involves CH polarization in such a way that the carbon develops a negative (δ) charge and the hydrogen develops a positive (δ+) charge. Alkyl activation leads to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and the Brnsted acid as intermediates.

The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D.

The intermediate D further undergoes carbenium activation,as shown in Scheme 2 (D [E] F). This reaction step can be visualized as the SN2 inversion of the methyl group to form an alkoxide. The transition state for the SN2 inversion has a planner CH2 group with apparent sp2 hybridization.

Alkyl activation is followed by desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate (F [I] J K + C2H4), leaving behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m).

For the Z4a ring structures, the undercoordinated Ga species [GaH]2+ lies in the plane with OAlO, in contrast to the more tetrahedral coordination of the Ga for the other cluster structures.

For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium activation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation, compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation.

The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a.

For the Z4a ring structures, the transition states for hydrogen removal indicate that the hydrogen molecule is located far from the active site and does not coordinate directly with the coordinatively unsaturated Ga or the bridging oxygen.

The overall activation energies against the standard heats of reduction for the mechanistic steps of carbenium activation are plotted in Fig. 7. There is a clear correlation between the heat of reduction and the carbenium activation energy. The overall carbenium activation energy (CEa) decreases rapidly with decreasing (more exothermic) heat of reduction (H 0 red). The less stable sites (Z4a, Z8a, and Z8b) show lower activation barriers.

For the same heat of reduction, the alkyl activation barrier (AEa) is about 20 kcal/mol lower than the overall carbenium activation barrier (CEa).

The overall activation energies against the heat of reduction for the alkyl activation are plotted in Fig. 8. A linear Polanyi relation [47] between the overall alkyl activation barrier (AEa) and the heat of reduction (H 0 red) is seen. The lines corresponding to alkyl activation and the hydrogen removal intersect at an activation energy value of 33 kcal/mol.

The comparison clearly indicates that the carbenium activation mechanism is more facile dehydrogenation mechanism near the optimum region indicated by the cross-section of the two Polanyi relations.

As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the free energy barrier for mechanistic steps involving adsorption of the molecules is substantially greater than the activation energy, and these free energy changes are sensitive to temperature.

Higher temperatures are also necessary to achieve favorable equilibrium for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction. Although the Z4a, Z8a, and Z8b sites are less stable in the galliummonohydride form at room temperature, under actual reaction conditions, they are stable with a positive free energy of reduction.

Our analysis indicates that the optimum AlAl distance will depend on the reaction conditions such as temperature, ethane partial pressure, and hydrogen partial pressure.

Our thermochemical analysis suggests that at the reaction temperature, sites with greater AlAl distances will be the active sites for dehydrogenation. This indicates that increasing the number of pair sites by decreasing the Si/Al ratio to a very low value (as in the case of Y zeolite) will not generate a catalyst with better activity.

The balance between activity and stability exemplifies the Sabatier principle for zeolite catalysis.

Our thermochemical analysis suggests that at reaction temperatures, most of the pair sites will be in their nonreduced form [GaH]2+Z2 d . This suggests that high temperature not only aids endothermic dehydrogenation, but also increases the number of active sites in the catalyst (catalyst activation).

Our thermodynamic analysis indicates that the pair sites with larger AlAl distances will play important roles at higher temperatures.

The activity of such sites, measured in terms of the activation barrier, is less sensitive to temperature, however.

The activation barrier for the optimum site (point of intersection of two Polanyi relations, Eopt act ) is 38.5 kcal/mol, in good agreement with the experimentally reported [44] activation barrier of 39 kcal/mol for ethane dehydrogenation.

Increasing the distance between the frameworkAl pair of the optimum site would mean that a higher fraction of the framework Al species would be able to form an active site.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a series of steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The mechanism begins with the opening of the gallium-oxygen (Ga-O) coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D), leading to the formation of an activated intermediate (D). This activation step is critical, as it sets the stage for subsequent reactions.

Key steps in the alkyl mechanism include:

1. **Initial Propane Activation**: Propane (C3H8) binds to the gallium surface through the opening of the Ga-O coordination, forming an activated intermediate (D). The orientation of the propane molecule is crucial, as it affects the subsequent steps. The alkyl mechanism proposes a sidewise adsorption of the propane molecule onto the gallium site, which contrasts with the end-on adsorption typical in carbenium activation.

2. **CH Bond Polarization**: The activation of the carbon-hydrogen (CH) bond within the propane molecule takes place. This involves the polarization of the CH bond, where the carbon atom acquires a negative charge (δ-) and the hydrogen atom acquires a positive charge (δ+). This step is analogous to alkyl activation in ethane dehydrogenation, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl compound (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates.

3. **Formation of Alkyl Compound**: Following the CH bond polarization, an alkyl compound (such as a methyl group) is formed. This is facilitated by the electrophilic attack of the gallium species on the polarized CH bond, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl species (MCnH2n+1) attached to the gallium site.

4. **Desorption of Alkene**: The next step involves the desorption of an alkene (such as ethene) from the gallium-alkyl intermediate. This step is typically structure-insensitive, meaning that the activation barrier does not significantly depend on the distance between the framework aluminum atoms.

5. **Hydrogen Removal**: Finally, the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m) removes molecular hydrogen (H2) to regenerate the active site, completing the catalytic cycle. This step is critical for the continuous operation of the PDH reaction.

**Comparison with Carbenium Mechanism**:
The carbenium mechanism involves the activation of the CH bond through the formation of a carbocation-like intermediate, leading to the formation of an alkoxide and a metal hydride. In contrast, the alkyl mechanism focuses on the formation of an alkyl compound and a Brnsted acid, followed by the desorption of an alkene and the regeneration of the gallium surface.

**Rate-Determining Step (RDS)**:
The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is because the activation of the CH bond is a critical step that sets the pace for subsequent reactions. The RDS is influenced by factors such as the stability of the intermediate, the strength of interactions between the substrate and the catalyst, and the energy barriers associated with the reaction pathways.

**Application to Different Ga Species Structures**:
The application of the alkyl mechanism varies across different gallium species structures, such as the 4-membered ring (Z4a), 5-membered ring (S5a), 6-membered ring (S6a and S6b), and 8-membered ring (Z8a and Z8b) clusters. Each structure influences the stability of the gallium monohydride ([GaH]2+) species, the ease of CH bond activation, and the efficiency of alkene desorption. The optimal structures are those that maximize the stability of the gallium monohydride species while minimizing the activation barriers for subsequent steps, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation activity.

**Conclusion**:
The alkyl mechanism provides an alternative route for propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts, offering insights into the role of different gallium species structures and the underlying reaction pathways. By understanding these mechanisms, researchers can optimize catalyst design and enhance the efficiency of PDH reactions, contributing to the broader field of hydrocarbon processing and renewable energy applications.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的加镓催化剂上详细描述了从初始丙烷激活到产物形成的关键步骤。该机制涉及一系列步骤，包括初始丙烷激活、碳氢键的极化、形成烷基化合物和氢气的去除等。

关键步骤包括：

1. **初始丙烷激活**：丙烷（C3H8）通过打开镓表面的镓氧（Ga-O）配位，与镓表面结合，形成激活中间体（D）。丙烷分子的吸附方式至关重要，它影响后续步骤。烷基机制提出丙烷分子以侧向吸附到镓位点，这与卡宾机制中典型的端向吸附形成对比。

2. **CH键极化**：通过形成类似于卡宾的中间体来激活CH键。这涉及CH键的极化，其中碳原子获得负电荷（δ-），氢原子获得正电荷（δ+）。此步骤类似于乙烷脱氢作用中的烷基激活，导致形成金属-烷基化合物（MCnH2n+1）和Brnsted酸作为中间体。

3. **形成烷基化合物**：随后发生的是烷基化合物（如甲基）的形成。这是由镓物种对极化CH键的亲电攻击促进的，导致形成与镓相连的烷基化合物。

4. **烯烃脱附**：下一步是烯烃（如乙烯）从镓-烷基中间体脱附。这是一个结构无关的过程，意味着激活壁垒不显著依赖于框架铝原子之间的距离。

5. **氢气去除**：最后，镓二氢离子（[GaH2]+Z m）去除分子氢（H2），以再生活性位点，完成催化循环。这是持续操作PDH反应的关键步骤。

**与卡宾机制的比较**：
卡宾机制涉及通过形成类似卡宾的中间体来激活CH键，导致形成醇类和金属氢化物。相比之下，烷基机制专注于形成烷基化合物和Brnsted酸，随后是烯烃脱附和表面再生。

**速率决定步骤（RDS）**：
在烷基机制中，CH键激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为CH键激活是决定后续反应速度的关键步骤。RDS受到中间体稳定性、底物与催化剂之间相互作用强度以及相关反应路径的能量壁垒等因素的影响。

**不同Ga物种结构的应用**：
不同镓物种结构（如4个环（Z4a）、5个环（S5a）、6个环（S6a和S6b）和8个环（Z8a和Z8b）簇）的应用各不相同。每个结构影响镓单氢离子（[GaH]2+）物种的稳定性、CH键激活的易程度和烯烃脱附的效率。最佳结构是那些最大化镓单氢离子物种稳定性同时最小化后续步骤的激活壁垒，从而增强脱氢活性的结构。

**结论**：
烷基机制为丙烷脱氢在加镓基催化剂上的替代途径提供了见解，深入探讨了不同镓物种结构和反应途径的作用。通过理解这些机制，研究人员可以优化催化剂设计并提高PDH反应的效率，为更广泛的石油加工和可再生能源应用领域做出贡献。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts is a process that involves the polarization of the CH bond in propane, leading to the formation of a metal-alkyl (MCnH2n+1) and a Brnsted acid as intermediates. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which involves the polarization of the CH bond in a way that creates a positive partial charge on the carbon atom and a negative partial charge on the hydrogen atom. 

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism. This is because the activation of the CH bond is a critical step that leads to the formation of the alkyl intermediate, which then undergoes further transformations to produce the desired products. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism typically involves a higher activation energy barrier for the CH activation step.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various gallium species structures. For instance, the stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species varies depending on the ring structure. In the S5a ring, the species is less stable, making alkyl activation more difficult compared to the Z4a ring. Despite this, the overall free energy of alkyl activation is lower than that of the carbenium activation. This indicates that the alkyl mechanism can be more energetically favorable under certain conditions.

The alkyl mechanism involves the desorption of an alkene (ethene) from the Gaalkyl intermediate, which leaves behind the gallium dihydride species ([GaH2]+Z m). The free energy barriers for this ethene removal step are typically higher than those encountered in the carbenium mechanism, suggesting that the alkene removal step might be a rate-limiting factor in the alkyl mechanism.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts is characterized by the formation of metal-alkyl intermediates through a series of steps, including CH activation, alkene removal, and hydrogen desorption. While the overall activation energy is lower compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkene removal step poses a challenge that might affect the overall efficiency of the process.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，以镓为基础的催化剂上是通过丙烷中CH键的极化形成金属-烷基（MCnH2n+1）和Brnsted酸作为中间体的过程。这与碳正电荷和氢负电荷形成的卡宾机制形成对比。

CH激活步骤被提议为烷基机制中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为它是一个关键步骤，导致形成烷基中间体，然后进一步转化以产生所需的产品。相比之下，卡宾机制通常具有更高的CH激活能量壁垒。

烷基机制在不同镓物种结构下应用有所不同。例如，二价镓单羟基物种在不同的环结构中稳定性不同。在S5a环中，物种较不稳定，使得烷基激活比Z4a环更困难。尽管如此，烷基激活的整体自由能仍然低于卡宾激活。这表明在某些条件下，烷基机制可能更加有利。

烷基机制涉及从Ga烷基中间体脱除烯烃（乙烯），留下二价镓氢化物物种([GaH2]+Z m)。乙烯脱除步骤的自由能壁垒通常高于卡宾机制，暗示乙烯脱除步骤可能是烷基机制中限制效率的因素之一。

总之，烷基机制在以镓为基础的催化剂上的丙烷脱氢反应中，通过一系列步骤形成金属-烷基中间体，包括CH激活、烯烃去除和氢脱附。虽然整体激活能较低，但烯烃脱除步骤可能会对过程的整体效率造成挑战。

This is contrasted with the carbenium activation mechanism, where the carbon atom assumes a positive partial charge and hydrogen assumes a negative partial charge. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the high activation barrier of about 60 kcal/mol for ethene removal from Gaalkyl species, making this step the limiting factor in the catalytic cycle. This mechanism applies differently to various gallium species structures, as the stability and coordination of the monohydride species affect the activation barriers and thus the efficiency of the PDH reaction.

[1] "We have used electronic DFT and thermochemical analysis to study the dehydrogenation mechanism catalyzed by [GaH]2+Z2 d sites in the Ga/H-ZSM-5. We have studied two different reaction paths for ethane dehydrogenation using pair Al sites."
[2] "The first step involves the opening of the GaO coordination (A + C2H6 [B] D in Scheme 2) to form the activated intermediate D."
[3] "For the 4-membered ring cluster Z4a, the overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is lower than the carbenium activation: 47.6 and 42.7 kcal/mol (Table 3) for alkyl activation, compared with 61.1 and 58.4 kcal/mol (Table 2) for carbenium activation."
[4] "The stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species in the S5a ring makes alkyl activation more difficult compared with that for Z4a."
[5] "The overall activation energy (AG0 a) for alkyl activation is lower than the carbenium activation, suggesting that alkyl activation might be the preferred pathway."
[6] "The balance between activity and stability exemplifies the Sabatier principle for zeolite catalysis."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the opening of the GaO coordination to form an activated intermediate, followed by the activation of the CH bond and desorption of the alkene product. It contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the CH bond is polarized towards forming a carbocation intermediate.

2. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it involves the most energy-intensive transformation, which limits the overall reaction rate.

3. Different Ga species structures impact the alkyl mechanism by affecting the stability of the GaH species and the ease of CH bond activation. Structures with larger Al-Al distances generally exhibit lower stability and higher activation barriers for the alkyl mechanism.

4. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures due to variations in the stability and coordination of the GaH species. Structures like S6a and S6b, with larger Al-Al distances, show higher activation barriers for the alkyl mechanism compared to Z4a and Z8a structures.

5. The Sabatier principle, which advocates for an optimal balance between activity and stability, is demonstrated in the alkyl mechanism. Structures with larger Al-Al distances tend to have lower stability, which aligns with the principle's emphasis on stability for activity.

1. 在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及打开GaO协调以形成活化中间体，然后是CH键的激活和烯烃产物的脱附。与碳正离子机制相比，它涉及到更复杂的转化步骤。

2. 烷基机制中的CH活化步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到能量最密集的转换，限制了整个反应速率。

3. 不同的Ga物种结构影响烷基机制，通过影响GaH物种的稳定性以及CH键激活的难度。较大的Al-Al距离通常会导致更低的稳定性以及更高的烷基机制的活化壁垒。

4. 烷基机制在不同的Ga物种结构中应用有所不同，由于稳定性以及GaH物种的配位方式的差异。例如，S6a和S6b结构与Z4a和Z8a结构相比，较大的Al-Al距离导致更高的烷基机制的活化壁垒。

5. Sabatier原理强调活动性和稳定性的平衡，烷基机制展示了这一点。较大的Al-Al距离倾向于降低稳定性，这与原理强调稳定性促进活性相一致。
