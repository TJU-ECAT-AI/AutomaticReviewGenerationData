1. The study employed density functional theory (DFT) and thermochemical analysis to investigate the dehydrogenation process catalyzed by [GaH]2+Z2 d sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5. 
2. The primary mechanisms involve carbenium activation and alkyl activation. 
3. For alkyl activation, the methyl group adsorbs sidewise rather than end-on, unlike carbenium activation. 
4. In the S5a structure, the stability of the bicationic gallium monohydride species leads to more difficulty in alkyl activation compared to the Z4a structure. 
5. The overall free energy of alkyl activation (AG0 a) is significantly lower than that of carbenium activation (AG0 a) for both Z4a and S5a structures. 
6. A linear Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi relationship exists for steps like carbenium activation, alkyl activation, and hydrogen removal. 
7. The balance between activity and stability reflects the Sabatier principle in zeolite catalysis. 
8. Expanding the distance between the framework Al pair increases the fraction of framework Al species that can form active sites.

1. 我们使用电子密度泛函理论（DFT）和热化学分析研究了Ga/H-ZSM-5中GaH]2+Z2 d 站点催化脱氢的机制。
2. 主要机制包括卡宾激活和烷基激活。
3. 对于烷基激活，甲基团以侧向吸附而不是端向吸附，与卡宾激活不同。 
4. 在S5a结构中，二价镓氢化物双阳离子物种的稳定性导致与Z4a结构相比，烷基激活更困难。 
5. 对于Z4a和S5a结构，烷基激活的整体自由能（AG0 a）明显低于卡宾激活。 
6. 存在卡宾激活、烷基激活和氢移除步骤的线性Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi关系。 
7. 活性和稳定性的平衡体现了沸石催化剂中的Sabatier原理。 
8. 扩大框架Al对之间的距离增加了能够形成活性位点的框架Al物种的比例。
