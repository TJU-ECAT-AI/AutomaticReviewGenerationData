The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts consists of several key steps: initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. Among these steps, the activation process is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) because of its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. Different Ga species structures influence the alkyl mechanism by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.
