Provide a comprehensive explanation of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts, detailing its key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compare this mechanism to the carbenium mechanism, discuss why the CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS), and explain how the alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures.

[1] "Computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI."
[2] "The key steps of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts include initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation."
[3] "The proposed carbenium mechanism involves a different pathway for activation and product formation compared to the alkyl mechanism."
[4] "The activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its influence on the overall reaction kinetics."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts consists of several key steps: initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. Among these steps, the activation process is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) because of its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. Different Ga species structures influence the alkyl mechanism by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial adsorption of propane molecules onto the Ga/H-MFI surface. Subsequently, the CH bond in propane cleaves, forming an alkyl group and a carbene intermediate. This alkyl group migrates across the catalyst surface to form an alkene. Finally, the alkene undergoes further reactions to produce ethylene and hydrogen. The activation energy for the CH bond cleavage is higher than for subsequent steps, making it the rate-determining step (RDS). The proposed alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which involves a more complex series of intermediates. The RDS in the alkyl mechanism is attributed to the specific structure of Ga species on the catalyst surface, which varies depending on the electronic properties and coordination environments of the Ga species.

烷基机制对丙烷脱氢（PDH）在镓基催化剂上的作用包括丙烷分子首先吸附到Ga/H-MFI表面。随后，丙烷中的CH键断裂，形成一个烷基团和一个碳烯中间体。这个烷基团在催化剂表面上迁移形成一个烯烃。最后，烯烃进一步反应产生乙烯和氢气。CH键断裂的活化能高于后续步骤，因此它是决定性步骤（RDS）。提出的烷基机制与碳烯机制不同，后者涉及更复杂的中间体系列。烷基机制的RDS归因于催化剂表面镓物种的特定结构，这取决于镓物种的电子特性和配位环境。

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts includes initial propane activation as a key step, leading to the conversion of propane to propylene. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which suggests an alternative pathway for PDH. The carbenium mechanism is characterized by a distinct activation step involving the CH group, which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the process. Different structures of Ga species influence how the alkyl mechanism operates within the catalytic process.
