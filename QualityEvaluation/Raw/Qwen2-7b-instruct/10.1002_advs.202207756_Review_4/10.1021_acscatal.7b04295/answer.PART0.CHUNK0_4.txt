1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts includes initial propane activation as a key step, leading to the conversion of propane to propylene. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which suggests an alternative pathway for PDH. The carbenium mechanism is characterized by a distinct activation step involving the CH group, which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the process. Different structures of Ga species influence how the alkyl mechanism operates within the catalytic process.

1. 在使用镓基催化剂催化轻烷烃脱氢的PDH反应中，烷基机制包括初始丙烷活化作为关键步骤，导致丙烷转化为丙烯。这种机制与碳正离子机制形成对比，后者提出了PDH的替代途径。碳正离子机制以涉及CH组分的独特激活步骤为特征，并被提议为过程中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。不同结构的Ga物种影响烷基机制在催化过程中的作用方式。
