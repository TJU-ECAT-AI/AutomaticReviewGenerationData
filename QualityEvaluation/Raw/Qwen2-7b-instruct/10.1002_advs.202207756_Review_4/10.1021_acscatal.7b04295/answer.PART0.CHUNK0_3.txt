The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial adsorption of propane molecules onto the Ga/H-MFI surface. Subsequently, the CH bond in propane cleaves, forming an alkyl group and a carbene intermediate. This alkyl group migrates across the catalyst surface to form an alkene. Finally, the alkene undergoes further reactions to produce ethylene and hydrogen. The activation energy for the CH bond cleavage is higher than for subsequent steps, making it the rate-determining step (RDS). The proposed alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which involves a more complex series of intermediates. The RDS in the alkyl mechanism is attributed to the specific structure of Ga species on the catalyst surface, which varies depending on the electronic properties and coordination environments of the Ga species.

烷基机制对丙烷脱氢（PDH）在镓基催化剂上的作用包括丙烷分子首先吸附到Ga/H-MFI表面。随后，丙烷中的CH键断裂，形成一个烷基团和一个碳烯中间体。这个烷基团在催化剂表面上迁移形成一个烯烃。最后，烯烃进一步反应产生乙烯和氢气。CH键断裂的活化能高于后续步骤，因此它是决定性步骤（RDS）。提出的烷基机制与碳烯机制不同，后者涉及更复杂的中间体系列。烷基机制的RDS归因于催化剂表面镓物种的特定结构，这取决于镓物种的电子特性和配位环境。
