Understanding the correlation between gallium speciation and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts involves examining the alkyl mechanism. This mechanism begins with the initial activation of propane, proceeding through various stages until product formation. The comparison with the carbenium mechanism highlights differences in reactivity pathways, with the CH activation step identified as the rate-determining step (RDS). This process is observed across different gallium species structures, affecting PDH activity on Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts.

理解镓物种与镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）活性之间的相关性，需要研究烷基机制。该机制从丙烷的初始活化开始，经过多个阶段直到产物形成。与碳烯基机制的比较突出了反应路径的不同，其中认为CH活化步骤是决定性速率步骤（RDS）。这一过程在不同镓物种结构中被观察到，影响着镓/H-ZSM-5催化剂的PDH活性。
