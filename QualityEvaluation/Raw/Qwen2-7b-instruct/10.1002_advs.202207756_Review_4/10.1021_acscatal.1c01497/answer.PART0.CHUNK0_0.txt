The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts, specifically Ga/H-ZSM-5, involves several key steps. Initially, propane is activated, which then undergoes dealkylation to form propylene. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, as the alkyl mechanism is favored due to its lower energy barriers. The CH activation step is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS). Different gallium species' structures impact the catalytic activity; the coordination environment around gallium atoms affects their reactivity.

烷基机制是丙烷脱氢（PDH）在镓基催化剂，特别是Ga/H-ZSM-5上的主导机制。其关键步骤包括丙烷的初始活化，随后发生去烷基化形成丙烯。与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制因其较低的能量壁垒而被青睐。CH活化步骤被认为是速率决定步骤（RDS）。不同的镓物种结构影响催化活性；镓原子周围的配位环境影响其反应性。
