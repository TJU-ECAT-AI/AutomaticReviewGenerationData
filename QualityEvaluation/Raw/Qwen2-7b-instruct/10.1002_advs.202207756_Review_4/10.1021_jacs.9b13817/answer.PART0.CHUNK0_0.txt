The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts begins with the activation of propane. Gallium then inserts itself into the C-H bond, creating an alkyl group. This process is identified as the rate-determining step due to its significant energy barrier and sequential nature. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, followed by a series of reactions to produce the final products. The activation of propane and the insertion of gallium into the C-H bond are critical steps in the alkyl mechanism, enhancing the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. Different gallium species structures can impact the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, influencing their catalytic characteristics.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及对丙烷的初始活化，随后镓原子插入C-H键，形成烷基团。这个过程被认为是决定性的步骤，因为它具有较高的能量壁垒和顺序性质。相比之下，碳烯机制涉及到形成碳烯离子中间体，然后进行一系列反应以形成所需的产物。丙烷的激活以及镓原子插入C-H键是烷基机制的关键步骤，提高了镓基催化剂中PDH反应的效率。不同镓物种结构可以影响方解石沸石中铝原子的排列，从而影响其催化特性。
