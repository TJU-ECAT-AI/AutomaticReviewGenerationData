          [1] "The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, followed by the insertion of a gallium atom into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl group."
          [2] "This process is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high energy barrier and the sequential nature of the reaction."
          [3] "In comparison, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products."
          [4] "The activation of the propane molecule and the subsequent insertion of the gallium atom into the C-H bond are key steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of the PDH reaction on gallium-based catalysts."
          [5] "Different Ga species structures can influence the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, affecting their catalytic properties."

          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts begins with the activation of propane, followed by the insertion of a gallium atom into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl group. This process is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high energy barrier and the sequential nature of the reaction. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products. Activation of propane and the subsequent insertion of gallium into the C-H bond are key steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. Different gallium species structures can impact the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, influencing their catalytic characteristics.

          丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制始于丙烷的活化，随后镓原子插入C-H键，形成烷基团。这一过程被认为是决定性的步骤（RDS），因为它具有较高的能量壁垒和顺序性质。相比之下，碳烯机制涉及到形成碳烯离子中间体，然后进行一系列反应以形成所需的产物。丙烷的激活以及随后的镓原子插入C-H键是烷基机制的关键步骤，显著提高了镓基催化剂中PDH反应的效率。不同镓物种结构可以影响方解石沸石中铝原子的排列，从而影响它们的催化特性。
