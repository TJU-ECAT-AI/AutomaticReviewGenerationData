The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts begins with the activation of propane molecules. This process leads to the formation of an alkyl intermediate, which then undergoes a series of transformations. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism involves the creation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which subsequently converts into products. Among these mechanisms, the activation step of propane is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because of its significant energy barrier. The alkyl mechanism is applicable to various Ga species structures, affecting the arrangement of aluminum ions within chabazite zeolites.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂上开始激活丙烷分子。这一过程导致形成一个烷基中间体，然后进行一系列转换。与之相比，碳烯离子机制涉及形成碳烯离子中间体，随后转化为产物。在这两种机制中，丙烷的活化步骤被认定为决定性步骤（RDS），因为其具有显著的能量壁垒。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，影响了钙沸石中铝离子的排列。
