Answer: The textural properties of the synthesized samples were assessed using a nitrogen adsorption/desorption technique at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. The specific surface area (SBET), micropore surface area, pore volume, and mesopore size distribution were quantified using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, t-plot method, and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, respectively.

The conversion of propane to aromatics was carried out in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. A 0.3 g of catalyst was placed into the reactor. Prior to the catalytic studies, zeolite samples were activated at 823 K in the flow of N2 for 2 h. The feed was the propane in N2 with the molar volume ratio of 1:1. All reactions were carried out at 823 K, GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 300 h-1, and atmospheric pressure.

Answer: Propane conversion to aromatics occurred in a continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor. A 0.3 g catalyst was introduced into the reactor. Before the catalytic experiments, zeolite samples were activated at 823 K under nitrogen flow for 2 hours. The feed consisted of propane in nitrogen with a molar volume ratio of 1:1. The reactions were conducted at 823 K, a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 300 h-1, and atmospheric pressure.

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of all as-synthesized samples. The characteristic diffraction patterns of HZSM-5-NS and HZSM-5-CON were identical to the typical reflection characteristic of the MFI framework structure, confirming that the synthesized aluminosilicates compose of a highly crystalline MFI framework without the contamination of any other crystalline phases. Ga-containing samples (Ga-HZSM-5- NS and Ga-HZSM-5-CON) also were the highly crystalline MFI.

Answer: Figure 1 displays the X-ray diffraction patterns of all synthesized samples. The distinctive diffraction patterns of HZSM-5-NS and HZSM-5-CON matched the standard reflection characteristic of the MFI framework structure, indicating that the synthesized aluminosilicates consist of a highly crystalline MFI framework without any contaminating crystalline phases. Ga-containing samples (Ga-HZSM-5-NS and Ga-HZSM-5-CON) also exhibited a highly crystalline MFI structure.

The textural properties of the synthesized samples were investigated by the N2 physisorption technique as shown in Table 1. The N2 sorption isotherms of the HZSM-5-CON and the Ga-HZSM-5-CON correspond to a type I isotherm because of the micropore filling41 (Fig. S3A (a-b) in the Supporting Information). In contrast, the HZSM-5-NS and the Ga-HZSM-5- NS exhibit the combination of the type I isotherm at low relative P/P0 and the hysteresis loop at high P/P0 due to a capillary condensation within mesopores and macropores (Fig.S3A (c-d) in the Supporting Information).

Answer: The textural properties of the synthesized samples were studied using nitrogen physical adsorption techniques, as detailed in Table 1. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of HZSM-5-CON and Ga-HZSM-5-CON align with a type I isotherm due to micropore filling (Figure S3A (a-b) in the Supporting Information). Conversely, HZSM-5-NS and Ga-HZSM-5-NS display a combination of a type I isotherm at low relative P/P0 and a hysteresis loop at high P/P0, resulting from capillary condensation within mesopores and macropores (Figure S3A (c-d) in the Supporting Information).
