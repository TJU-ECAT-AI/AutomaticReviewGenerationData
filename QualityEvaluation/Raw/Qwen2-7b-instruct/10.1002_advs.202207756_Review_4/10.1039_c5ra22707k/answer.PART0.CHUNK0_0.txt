1. The conversion of propane to high value-added aromatic products, like benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), is a significant topic in both academic research and the petrochemical industry. Gallium (Ga) plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the Brnsted acid sites of zeolite facilitate the oligomerization of olefins and subsequent aromatization to form aromatics.

2. Typically, gallium-loaded zeolites, such as Ga/ZSM-5, are prepared through post-synthesis treatments, including impregnation or ion-exchange processes.

3. In contrast, gallium incorporated into HZSM-5 via an in-situ hydrothermal method yields a higher aromatic yield for the conversion of light alkanes. This is due to the highly dispersed active gallium species being closely located near the Brnsted acid sites.

4. The textural properties of the synthesized samples were studied using nitrogen physisorption techniques, as detailed in Table 1.

5. This behavior suggests that both aluminosilicate and galloaluminosilicate nanosheets possess a microporous structure inherent to zeolite characteristics, alongside mesopores and macropores derived from the layer assemblies and interparticle voids.

1. 将丙烷转化为高附加值的芳烃产品，如苯、甲苯和二甲苯（BTX），是学术界和石油化工行业关注的重要问题。镓（Ga）在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的过程中起着重要作用，而沸石的Brnsted酸位则促进烯烃的聚合和后续的芳香化反应以生成芳烃。

2. 通常，通过浸渍或离子交换等后合成处理方法制备Ga/ZSM-5等镓负载型沸石。

3. 相比之下，通过原位水热法获得的Ga/HZSM-5在轻烷烃转化过程中能产生更高的芳烃产率。这是由于活性镓物种高度分散且位于接近Brnsted酸位的附近。

4. 合成样品的纹理性质通过氮气物理吸附技术进行了研究，并在表1中详细列出。

5. 这一行为表明，无论是常规的铝硅酸盐还是镓铝硅酸盐纳米片都具备由沸石特性带来的微孔结构，以及层间结构和颗粒间空隙产生的介孔和大孔。
