[1] "Zeolites are regularly the crystalline aluminosilicates with a well-defined three-dimensional structure."
[2] "As a result, they have played an important role in various potential applications ranging from adsorption to separation and catalysis."
[3] "Although the zeolite nanocrystals exhibit great external surface areas and provide the fast diffusion of guest molecules to accessible active sites,10, 11 the zeolite nanocrystals also suffer from an increase of pressure drop in a packed-bed reactor and a high cost of the synthesized process due to their difficult separation after synthesis or/and reaction processes."
[4] "An alternative way to improve the efficiency of conventional zeolites is to design the zeolites with hierarchical porous structures, namely hierarchical zeolites."
[5] "These materials compose of at least two levels of porosity such as micro-mesoporous or micro-macroporous or micro-meso-macroporous structures."
[6] "The advantages of these materials are not only to greatly decrease diffusion limitation due to reducing their diffusion path length, but also to generate a secondary porous structure between their layers."
[7] "This results in the addition of the meso/macroporous molecular highway connected to the microporous diffusion path providing high accessible active sites."
[8] "In 2009, Choi et al.15 have discovered a new synthetic route by using the designed diquaternary ammonium-type surfactant (C22H45-N1(CH3)2-C6H12-N1(CH3)2-C6H13) as a structure directing agent (SDA) to directly design single-unit-cell MFI nanosheets."
[9] "Recently, Wueyi Zhang et al.16 demonstrated the synthesis of self-pillared MFI nanosheets by repetitive branching."
[10] "The tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH) was also used as a bifunctional structure agent controlling the structures of microporous MFI and 2D nanolayers, resulting in the formation of a house of cards structure by repetitive branching of MFI nanosheets."
[11] "Although there are several synthetic approaches to be revealed for the preparation of hierarchical MFI nanosheets, there are only a few works focusing on the direct synthesis of ZSM-5 nanosheets by using a phosphonium structure-directing agent (SDA)."
[12] "This type of template also has many advantages, such as its low cost and high stability compared with other quaternary ammonium surfactants."
[13] "In addition to the aluminosilicate zeolites, the incorporation of metal atoms to the zeolite framework exhibits the interesting properties."
[14] "18 In particular, the gallium-incorporated zeolites are the effective bifunctional catalysts for converting light alkanes to aromatics."
[15] "These materials are not only to improve the aromatic yield but also to increase the catalyst stability due to a relative decrease of acid strength compared with the aluminosilicate zeolites."
[16] "This behavior leads to a significant decrease of coke formation."
[17] "The conversion of propane to high value-added aromatic products, such as benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX),is an interesting issue in both academic and petrochemical industrial points of view."
[18] "Several studies have shown that the bifunctional gallium loaded HZSM-5 is one of the most suitable catalysts for aromatization of propane."
[19] "Typically, the Ga species have played an important role for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the Brnsted acid sites of zeolite promote the oligomerization of olefins and the subsequent aromatization to produce the aromatics."
[20] "26-29 Typically, the Ga/ZSM-5 has been prepared by the post synthesis treatment,such as an impregnation, and an ion-exchange."
[21] "In contrast, the Ga/HZSM-5 obtained from an in-situ hydrothermal method gives a higher aromatic yield for the aromatization of light alkanes due to highly dispersed active gallium species in close vicinity to Brnsted acid sites."
[22] "However, it often suffers from the fast deactivation of catalysts."
[23] "To improve the efficiency of catalysts for converting propane to aromatics, Yassir et al.37 reported the benefits of mesoporous galloaluminosilicates for the aromatization of propane."
[24] "Hierarchical Ga/HZSM-5 was prepared by three-step modifications, involving the direct-hydrothermal synthesis of conventional Ga/HZSM-5, the steaming of the obtained zeolites and the subsequent hydrolysis of steam-treated zeolites in the presence of surfactant to generate the mesoporous feature."
[25] "Recently, Ogunronbi et al.38 reported the synthesis of the hierarchical Ga-containing HZSM-5 zeolite by a top-down post-synthesis method (e.g., desilication, alkaline treatment, CTAB-mediated assembly of Ga-containing zeolite seed into MCM-41 mesostructure, etc.)."
[26] "Although there are some reports describing the synthesis of mesoporous galloaluminosilicates, most of them have focused on the post synthesis treatment,which requires several steps of preparation."
[27] "To date, the design of the galloaluminosilicate with hierarchical nanosheet structure has not yet been demonstrated."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane molecules are activated on the surface of the gallium-containing zeolite catalyst. The activation step, particularly the carbenium ion formation, is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH reaction pathway. This activation allows the propane molecule to be transformed into a reactive intermediate, which then undergoes dehydrogenation to form propylene.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism focuses on the reactivity of alkyl groups. In the context of gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism explains how the gallium species, typically in the form of gallium oxide or gallium incorporated into the zeolite framework, facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The gallium atoms, acting as Lewis acids, interact with the hydrogen atoms of propane, leading to the formation of alkyl groups. Subsequently, these alkyl groups undergo further reactions, including oligomerization and subsequent aromatization, to produce high-value-added aromatic products such as benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX).

The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, primarily relies on the formation of a carbenium ion as the reactive intermediate during the PDH process. This mechanism emphasizes the role of the zeolite's Brnsted acid sites in promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. The carbenium ion is formed when the hydrogen atoms of propane are abstracted, leading to the production of a positively charged intermediate that can then react with other molecules to form larger hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds.

The proposed alkyl mechanism for PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts highlights the importance of alkyl groups in the catalytic process, offering an alternative pathway to the traditional carbenium mechanism. It suggests that the gallium species, whether in the form of gallium oxide or integrated within the zeolite framework, play a crucial role in facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and the subsequent aromatization to BTX. This mechanism not only enhances the understanding of the PDH reaction dynamics but also provides insights into the design of more efficient catalysts for propane aromatization.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different gallium species structures by leveraging the unique properties of gallium, such as its ability to incorporate into zeolite frameworks and modulate the acidity of the zeolite sites. Gallium's incorporation into the zeolite structure can lead to the creation of highly dispersed gallium species, which are more reactive and can better facilitate the PDH reaction. Additionally, the gallium species can interact with the zeolite's Brnsted acid sites, enhancing the catalyst's stability and activity in the PDH process. This mechanism's applicability across various gallium species structures underscores the versatility of gallium-based catalysts in propane aromatization.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，以镓基催化剂为载体，涉及几个关键步骤。首先，丙烷分子在表面活性的镓含杂沸石催化剂上被激活。激活步骤，特别是形成碳烯离子，被认为是PDH反应途径中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这种激活允许丙烷分子转化为活性中间体，然后进一步进行脱氢反应生成丙烯。

与碳烯机制相比，烷基机制侧重于烷基团的反应性。在镓基催化剂的背景下，烷基机制解释了镓物种（通常以镓氧化物或集成到沸石骨架中的镓形式）如何促进丙烷脱氢到丙烯的过程。镓原子作为路易斯酸的作用，与丙烷分子中的氢原子相互作用，导致形成烷基团。随后，这些烷基团经历进一步反应，包括聚合和随后的芳构化，以产生高附加值的芳香产品如苯、甲苯和二甲苯（BTX）。

碳烯机制主要依赖于形成碳烯离子作为反应中间体的PDH过程。该机制强调了沸石的Brnsted酸位点在促进脱氢反应中的作用。当丙烷分子中的氢原子被提取时，形成一个正电荷的中间体，然后可以与其它分子反应形成较大的烃类或芳香化合物。

提出的烷基机制为PDH反应提供了另一种途径，强调了烷基团在催化过程中的重要性，提供了一种与传统碳烯机制不同的PDH反应动力学理解。它表明镓物种，无论是以镓氧化物的形式还是嵌入到沸石骨架中，都在促进丙烷脱氢到丙烯以及随后的芳构化过程中发挥着关键作用。这一机制不仅加深了对PDH反应动态性的理解，而且为设计更高效的催化剂用于丙烷芳构化提供了见解。

烷基机制适用于不同镓物种结构，通过利用镓的独特性质，如其能够集成到沸石骨架中并调节沸石位点的酸性，来实现PDH反应。镓的集成到沸石结构中可以导致高度分散的镓物种的形成，这些物种更加活跃，并能更好地促进PDH反应。此外，镓物种还可以与沸石的Brnsted酸位点相互作用，提高催化剂的稳定性和活性在PDH过程中。这一机制在不同镓物种结构上的适用性突显了镓基催化剂在丙烷芳构化方面的灵活性。
