Answer: The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane (CH3)3CH, followed by the dehydrogenation step to form propylene (CH2=CHCH3). The key steps are:

1. **Activation of Propane**: Propane molecules adsorb onto the gallium sites on the catalyst surface. This is facilitated by the bifunctional structure-directing agent (SDA) tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH), which not only forms the MFI zeolite structure but also creates self-assemblies of nanolayers that enhance the surface area and porosity of the catalyst.

2. **Dehydrogenation**: Once activated, the propane molecule undergoes dehydrogenation, removing hydrogen atoms to form propylene. Gallium species on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in this step, as they are responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

3. **Carbenium Formation**: The proposed mechanism suggests that the formation of a carbenium intermediate occurs during the dehydrogenation step. This is a stable, high-energy species that is formed temporarily as a result of the dehydrogenation process.

4. **Product Formation**: The carbenium intermediate then undergoes further reactions to form propylene. The specific details of these reactions depend on the structure of the gallium species on the catalyst surface, which influences the acidity of the catalyst and thus the pathway for propylene formation.

The activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This is because the efficiency of propane adsorption and activation onto the gallium sites on the catalyst surface directly affects the overall rate of the PDH reaction. The bifunctional TBPOH plays a critical role in enhancing the rate of activation by promoting the formation of the MFI structure and the self-assemblies of nanolayers, which increases the surface area and thus the number of active sites for propane activation.

Answer: 烷基机理在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及丙烷（CH3）3CH的激活，随后通过脱氢步骤形成丙烯（CH2=CHCH3）。关键步骤包括：

1. **丙烷的激活**：丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面的镓位点上。这得益于双功能结构导向剂四丁基磷化物氢氧化物（TBPOH），它不仅形成了MFI沸石结构，还创建了纳米层的自组装，从而提高了催化剂的表面积和孔隙率。

2. **脱氢**：激活后，丙烷分子经历脱氢，去除氢原子形成丙烯。催化剂表面的镓物种在这一过程中起着关键作用，它们负责将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。

3. **碳烯形成**：推测机制表明，在脱氢步骤中形成碳烯中间体。这是一种暂时形成的、高能的物种，是脱氢过程的结果。

4. **产物形成**：碳烯中间体随后进行进一步反应形成丙烯。具体反应取决于催化剂表面镓物种的结构，这影响催化剂的酸性，从而决定了丙烯形成途径。

激活步骤被认为是这一机制的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为丙烷在镓位点上的活性直接关系到PDH反应的整体速率。双功能TBPOH通过促进MFI结构和纳米层自组装的形成，增强活性位点的数量，从而提高丙烷激活的效率。
