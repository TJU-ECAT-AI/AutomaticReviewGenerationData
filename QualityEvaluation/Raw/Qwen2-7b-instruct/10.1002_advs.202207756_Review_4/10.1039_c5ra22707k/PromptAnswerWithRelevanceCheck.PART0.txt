1. The conversion of propane to high value-added aromatic products, like benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), is a significant topic in both academic research and the petrochemical industry. Gallium (Ga) plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, while the Brnsted acid sites of zeolite facilitate the oligomerization of olefins and subsequent aromatization to form aromatics.

2. Typically, gallium-loaded zeolites, such as Ga/ZSM-5, are prepared through post-synthesis treatments, including impregnation or ion-exchange processes.

3. In contrast, gallium incorporated into HZSM-5 via an in-situ hydrothermal method yields a higher aromatic yield for the conversion of light alkanes. This is due to the highly dispersed active gallium species being closely located near the Brnsted acid sites.

4. The textural properties of the synthesized samples were studied using nitrogen physisorption techniques, as detailed in Table 1.

5. This behavior suggests that both aluminosilicate and galloaluminosilicate nanosheets possess a microporous structure inherent to zeolite characteristics, alongside mesopores and macropores derived from the layer assemblies and interparticle voids.

2. 通常，通过浸渍或离子交换等后合成处理方法制备Ga/ZSM-5等镓负载型沸石。

3. 相比之下，通过原位水热法获得的Ga/HZSM-5在轻烷烃转化过程中能产生更高的芳烃产率。这是由于活性镓物种高度分散且位于接近Brnsted酸位的附近。

Answer: The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane (CH3)3CH, followed by the dehydrogenation step to form propylene (CH2=CHCH3). The key steps are:

1. **Activation of Propane**: Propane molecules adsorb onto the gallium sites on the catalyst surface. This is facilitated by the bifunctional structure-directing agent (SDA) tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide (TBPOH), which not only forms the MFI zeolite structure but also creates self-assemblies of nanolayers that enhance the surface area and porosity of the catalyst.

2. **Dehydrogenation**: Once activated, the propane molecule undergoes dehydrogenation, removing hydrogen atoms to form propylene. Gallium species on the catalyst surface play a crucial role in this step, as they are responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

3. **Carbenium Formation**: The proposed mechanism suggests that the formation of a carbenium intermediate occurs during the dehydrogenation step. This is a stable, high-energy species that is formed temporarily as a result of the dehydrogenation process.

4. **Product Formation**: The carbenium intermediate then undergoes further reactions to form propylene. The specific details of these reactions depend on the structure of the gallium species on the catalyst surface, which influences the acidity of the catalyst and thus the pathway for propylene formation.

The activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism. This is because the efficiency of propane adsorption and activation onto the gallium sites on the catalyst surface directly affects the overall rate of the PDH reaction. The bifunctional TBPOH plays a critical role in enhancing the rate of activation by promoting the formation of the MFI structure and the self-assemblies of nanolayers, which increases the surface area and thus the number of active sites for propane activation.

Answer: 烷基机理在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及丙烷（CH3）3CH的激活，随后通过脱氢步骤形成丙烯（CH2=CHCH3）。关键步骤包括：

1. **丙烷的激活**：丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面的镓位点上。这得益于双功能结构导向剂四丁基磷化物氢氧化物（TBPOH），它不仅形成了MFI沸石结构，还创建了纳米层的自组装，从而提高了催化剂的表面积和孔隙率。

2. **脱氢**：激活后，丙烷分子经历脱氢，去除氢原子形成丙烯。催化剂表面的镓物种在这一过程中起着关键作用，它们负责将丙烷脱氢为丙烯。

3. **碳烯形成**：推测机制表明，在脱氢步骤中形成碳烯中间体。这是一种暂时形成的、高能的物种，是脱氢过程的结果。

4. **产物形成**：碳烯中间体随后进行进一步反应形成丙烯。具体反应取决于催化剂表面镓物种的结构，这影响催化剂的酸性，从而决定了丙烯形成途径。

激活步骤被认为是这一机制的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这是因为丙烷在镓位点上的活性直接关系到PDH反应的整体速率。双功能TBPOH通过促进MFI结构和纳米层自组装的形成，增强活性位点的数量，从而提高丙烷激活的效率。

[3] "Although the zeolite nanocrystals exhibit great external surface areas and provide the fast diffusion of guest molecules to accessible active sites,10, 11 the zeolite nanocrystals also suffer from an increase of pressure drop in a packed-bed reactor and a high cost of the synthesized process due to their difficult separation after synthesis or/and reaction processes."
[4] "An alternative way to improve the efficiency of conventional zeolites is to design the zeolites with hierarchical porous structures, namely hierarchical zeolites."
[5] "These materials compose of at least two levels of porosity such as micro-mesoporous or micro-macroporous or micro-meso-macroporous structures."
[6] "The advantages of these materials are not only to greatly decrease diffusion limitation due to reducing their diffusion path length, but also to generate a secondary porous structure between their layers."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane molecules are activated on the surface of the gallium-containing zeolite catalyst. The activation step, particularly the carbenium ion formation, is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in the PDH reaction pathway. This activation allows the propane molecule to be transformed into a reactive intermediate, which then undergoes dehydrogenation to form propylene.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism focuses on the reactivity of alkyl groups. In the context of gallium-based catalysts, the alkyl mechanism explains how the gallium species, typically in the form of gallium oxide or gallium incorporated into the zeolite framework, facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The gallium atoms, acting as Lewis acids, interact with the hydrogen atoms of propane, leading to the formation of alkyl groups. Subsequently, these alkyl groups undergo further reactions, including oligomerization and subsequent aromatization, to produce high-value-added aromatic products such as benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX).

The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, primarily relies on the formation of a carbenium ion as the reactive intermediate during the PDH process. This mechanism emphasizes the role of the zeolite's Brnsted acid sites in promoting the dehydrogenation reaction. The carbenium ion is formed when the hydrogen atoms of propane are abstracted, leading to the production of a positively charged intermediate that can then react with other molecules to form larger hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds.

The proposed alkyl mechanism for PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts highlights the importance of alkyl groups in the catalytic process, offering an alternative pathway to the traditional carbenium mechanism. It suggests that the gallium species, whether in the form of gallium oxide or integrated within the zeolite framework, play a crucial role in facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and the subsequent aromatization to BTX. This mechanism not only enhances the understanding of the PDH reaction dynamics but also provides insights into the design of more efficient catalysts for propane aromatization.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different gallium species structures by leveraging the unique properties of gallium, such as its ability to incorporate into zeolite frameworks and modulate the acidity of the zeolite sites. Gallium's incorporation into the zeolite structure can lead to the creation of highly dispersed gallium species, which are more reactive and can better facilitate the PDH reaction. Additionally, the gallium species can interact with the zeolite's Brnsted acid sites, enhancing the catalyst's stability and activity in the PDH process. This mechanism's applicability across various gallium species structures underscores the versatility of gallium-based catalysts in propane aromatization.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，以镓基催化剂为载体，涉及几个关键步骤。首先，丙烷分子在表面活性的镓含杂沸石催化剂上被激活。激活步骤，特别是形成碳烯离子，被认为是PDH反应途径中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。这种激活允许丙烷分子转化为活性中间体，然后进一步进行脱氢反应生成丙烯。

与碳烯机制相比，烷基机制侧重于烷基团的反应性。在镓基催化剂的背景下，烷基机制解释了镓物种（通常以镓氧化物或集成到沸石骨架中的镓形式）如何促进丙烷脱氢到丙烯的过程。镓原子作为路易斯酸的作用，与丙烷分子中的氢原子相互作用，导致形成烷基团。随后，这些烷基团经历进一步反应，包括聚合和随后的芳构化，以产生高附加值的芳香产品如苯、甲苯和二甲苯（BTX）。

碳烯机制主要依赖于形成碳烯离子作为反应中间体的PDH过程。该机制强调了沸石的Brnsted酸位点在促进脱氢反应中的作用。当丙烷分子中的氢原子被提取时，形成一个正电荷的中间体，然后可以与其它分子反应形成较大的烃类或芳香化合物。

提出的烷基机制为PDH反应提供了另一种途径，强调了烷基团在催化过程中的重要性，提供了一种与传统碳烯机制不同的PDH反应动力学理解。它表明镓物种，无论是以镓氧化物的形式还是嵌入到沸石骨架中，都在促进丙烷脱氢到丙烯以及随后的芳构化过程中发挥着关键作用。这一机制不仅加深了对PDH反应动态性的理解，而且为设计更高效的催化剂用于丙烷芳构化提供了见解。

烷基机制适用于不同镓物种结构，通过利用镓的独特性质，如其能够集成到沸石骨架中并调节沸石位点的酸性，来实现PDH反应。镓的集成到沸石结构中可以导致高度分散的镓物种的形成，这些物种更加活跃，并能更好地促进PDH反应。此外，镓物种还可以与沸石的Brnsted酸位点相互作用，提高催化剂的稳定性和活性在PDH过程中。这一机制在不同镓物种结构上的适用性突显了镓基催化剂在丙烷芳构化方面的灵活性。

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism, meaning that the speed of the reaction is most limited by the rate of this activation step. The alkyl mechanism, on the other hand, describes a pathway where the propane molecule is transformed into an alkyl group, which subsequently reacts to form aromatic products. This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, considering the varying interactions and reactivities of the gallium species with the propane molecule depending on their specific configurations and environments on the catalyst surface.
