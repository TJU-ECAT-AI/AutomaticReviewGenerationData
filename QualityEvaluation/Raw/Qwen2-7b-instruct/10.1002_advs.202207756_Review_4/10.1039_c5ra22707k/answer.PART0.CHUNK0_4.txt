The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. It begins with the activation of propane, where the propane molecule adsorbs onto the catalyst surface and undergoes an activation step, possibly through the formation of a carbocation or a carbenium ion. The carbenium mechanism suggests that the activation of the propane molecule results in the formation of a carbenium ion, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form aromatic products. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in this mechanism, meaning that the speed of the reaction is most limited by the rate of this activation step. The alkyl mechanism, on the other hand, describes a pathway where the propane molecule is transformed into an alkyl group, which subsequently reacts to form aromatic products. This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, considering the varying interactions and reactivities of the gallium species with the propane molecule depending on their specific configurations and environments on the catalyst surface.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤，从初始丙烷活化到产物形成。它以丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面并经历激活步骤开始，可能通过形成碳正离子或碳烯离子的形式。碳烯机制表明，丙烷分子的活化导致形成碳烯离子，然后进行一系列反应形成芳香族产品。CH活化步骤被提议为该机制的速率决定步骤（RDS），这意味着反应的速度最由此激活步骤的速率限制。烷基机制描述了一条途径，其中丙烷分子转化为烷基团，随后与形成芳香族产品进行反应。这一机制适用于不同Ga物种结构，考虑到镓物种与丙烷分子之间的不同相互作用和活性取决于它们在催化剂表面的具体配置和环境。
