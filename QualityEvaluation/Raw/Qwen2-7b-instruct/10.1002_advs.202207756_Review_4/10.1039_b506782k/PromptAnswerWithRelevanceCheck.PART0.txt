[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[2] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[3] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[4] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the oxidative addition of propane onto univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures. This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium. These fragments decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where propane undergoes a series of steps leading to the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it is the first step that significantly influences the reaction kinetics. This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the univalent Ga1 ions facilitate the oxidative addition process, leading to the selective conversion of propane into ethylene without the formation of Brnsted acid sites that could lead to coke formation and deactivation of the catalyst.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及在较高温度下，通过氧化添加将丙烷添加到一价Ga1离子上。这导致乙基和氢化物碎片附着在镓上。这些碎片在进一步加热时分解成乙烯和镓二氢化合物。这一机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及一系列步骤，最终形成碳正离子中间体。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它显著影响反应动力学。这一机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，因为一价Ga1离子促进氧化添加过程，导致选择性地将丙烷转化为乙烯，而不会形成可能导致催化剂失活的Brnsted酸中心，从而产生焦炭。

Ethane activation over Zn/ZSM-5 occurs through a mechanism where ethane is strongly adsorbed at room temperature, leading to a high degree of polarizability. Upon heating, the complex dissociates over the Lewis acid sites, generating Brnsted acid protons. In contrast, ethane activation over Ga/ZSM-5 occurs via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments. These fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The lack of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 allows for a stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene. Meanwhile, Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits higher initial activity but experiences coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the creation of Brnsted acidity.

在Zn/ZSM-5上，乙烷激活通过机制发生，其中乙烷在室温下强烈吸附，导致高度极化。加热后，该复合物在Lewis酸位点上分解，产生Brnsted酸质子。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5上的乙烷激活通过在高温下过氧化插入单价Ga1离子发生，导致乙基和氢化物碎片的形成。这些碎片分解成乙烯和镓二氢化合物。Ga/ZSM-5中缺乏Brnsted酸质子的形成允许乙烷稳定且选择性地转化为乙烯。同时，Zn/ZSM-5表现出更高的初始活性，但因产生Brnsted酸性而经历焦炭化失活和二次芳构化反应。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a series of steps where propane is initially activated through oxidative addition to univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures. This process leads to the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments that coordinate to Ga31 species. These fragments then decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which is more commonly associated with PDH reactions on other types of catalysts. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most critical and time-consuming step in the entire process. The alkyl mechanism applies differently depending on the structure of the Ga species, with reduced Ga/ZSM-5 exhibiting a more stable and selective conversion of propane to ethylene due to the absence of Brnsted acid proton formation, whereas Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from deactivation and secondary reactions due to the formation of Brnsted acidity.

烷基机制在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应涉及一系列步骤，其中丙烷首先通过氧化添加到升高的温度下的一价Ga1离子上进行激活。这一过程导致乙基和氢化物片段形成并协调到Ga31物种。这些片段随后在进一步加热时分解成乙烯和镓二氢化合物。这种机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者通常与其它类型的催化剂上的PDH反应相关联。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它在整个过程中是最关键且耗时最多的步骤。根据Ga物种的不同结构，烷基机制的应用也有所不同，由于缺乏Brnsted酸质子形成，减少的Ga/ZSM-5表现出更稳定和选择性的丙烷转化为乙烯，而Zn/ZSM-5则显示出更高的初始活性，但由于形成Brnsted酸性，导致催化剂失活和次级反应。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves weak adsorption of propane onto reduced Ga/ZSM-5. Propane activation occurs through oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures, leading to the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium. These fragments decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon propane activation enables stable and selective conversion of propane into ethylene.

In contrast, the carbenium mechanism typically involves strong adsorption of propane on zinc-based catalysts. Propane is strongly polarized by zinc cations, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragment and a proton upon subsequent heating. This regeneration of Brnsted acid protons facilitates the conversion of propane into aromatic products and coke formation.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts due to the weak adsorption of propane and the subsequent oxidative addition over Ga1 ions. This allows for the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments, which decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides, leading to stable and selective ethylene production.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently depending on the Ga species structure. For reduced Ga/ZSM-5, the mechanism involves weak adsorption, oxidative addition, and subsequent decomposition into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. For zinc-modified ZSM-5, the mechanism includes strong adsorption, heterolytic dissociation, and coke formation.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，丙烷在还原态Ga/ZSM-5上的吸附较弱。在高温下，丙烷通过氧化插入到单价Ga1离子上进行激活，形成连接在镓上的乙基和氢化物片段。这些片段进一步分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物，导致乙烯的稳定且选择性的生成。

相比之下，卡本离子机制通常涉及在锌基催化剂上的丙烷吸附。丙烷通过锌离子强烈极化，导致随后加热时发生异裂，形成锌乙基片段和一个质子，从而再生出Brnsted酸性基团。这促进了丙烷转化为芳香族产物和焦炭的生成。

丙烷活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为在镓基催化剂上的丙烷活化过程中，丙烷的吸附较弱，并且随后通过氧化插入到Ga1离子上进行。这允许形成乙基和氢化物片段，它们进一步分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物，导致稳定的乙烯生成。

根据Ga物种结构的不同，该机制的应用也有所不同。对于还原态Ga/ZSM-5，机制涉及弱吸附、氧化插入和随后的分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物。而对于锌修饰的ZSM-5，机制包括强吸附、异裂以及焦炭形成。

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves weak adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface. At elevated temperatures, propane undergoes oxidative addition to univalent Ga1 ions, forming ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium. These fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it relies on oxidative addition rather than carbenium ion formation. The activation step involving propane is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the weak adsorption strength and the subsequent oxidative addition process. The alkyl mechanism is applicable to different Ga species structures, including reduced Ga1 ions and Ga11 species, as demonstrated in the study.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷在催化剂表面的弱吸附。在高温下，丙烷通过氧化加成作用到单价Ga1离子上，形成连接在镓上的乙基和氢化物片段。这些片段分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物。与碳正离子机制不同，该机制依赖于氧化加成而非碳正离子的形成。由于吸附强度较弱以及随后的氧化加成过程，激活步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS）。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括还原的Ga1离子和Ga11物种，如研究中所示。
