[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[2] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[3] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[4] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[5] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the oxidative addition of propane onto univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures. This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium. These fragments decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where propane undergoes a series of steps leading to the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it is the first step that significantly influences the reaction kinetics. This mechanism applies to different Ga species structures, as the univalent Ga1 ions facilitate the oxidative addition process, leading to the selective conversion of propane into ethylene without the formation of Brnsted acid sites that could lead to coke formation and deactivation of the catalyst.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，涉及在较高温度下，通过氧化添加将丙烷添加到一价Ga1离子上。这导致乙基和氢化物碎片附着在镓上。这些碎片在进一步加热时分解成乙烯和镓二氢化合物。这一机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者涉及一系列步骤，最终形成碳正离子中间体。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它显著影响反应动力学。这一机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，因为一价Ga1离子促进氧化添加过程，导致选择性地将丙烷转化为乙烯，而不会形成可能导致催化剂失活的Brnsted酸中心，从而产生焦炭。
