[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon."
[2] "Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[3] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[4] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[5] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[6] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) on gallium-based catalysts involves weak adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface. At elevated temperatures, propane undergoes oxidative addition to univalent Ga1 ions, forming ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium. These fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism in that it relies on oxidative addition rather than carbenium ion formation. The activation step involving propane is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) due to the weak adsorption strength and the subsequent oxidative addition process. The alkyl mechanism is applicable to different Ga species structures, including reduced Ga1 ions and Ga11 species, as demonstrated in the study.

丙烷脱氢（PDH）在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷在催化剂表面的弱吸附。在高温下，丙烷通过氧化加成作用到单价Ga1离子上，形成连接在镓上的乙基和氢化物片段。这些片段分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物。与碳正离子机制不同，该机制依赖于氧化加成而非碳正离子的形成。由于吸附强度较弱以及随后的氧化加成过程，激活步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS）。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，包括还原的Ga1离子和Ga11物种，如研究中所示。
