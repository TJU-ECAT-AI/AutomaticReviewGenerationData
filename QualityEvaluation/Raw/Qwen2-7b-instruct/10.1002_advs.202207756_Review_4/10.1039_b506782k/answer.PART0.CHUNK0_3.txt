[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[2] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[3] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[4] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[5] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves weak adsorption of propane onto reduced Ga/ZSM-5. Propane activation occurs through oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures, leading to the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium. These fragments decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon propane activation enables stable and selective conversion of propane into ethylene.

In contrast, the carbenium mechanism typically involves strong adsorption of propane on zinc-based catalysts. Propane is strongly polarized by zinc cations, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragment and a proton upon subsequent heating. This regeneration of Brnsted acid protons facilitates the conversion of propane into aromatic products and coke formation.

The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts due to the weak adsorption of propane and the subsequent oxidative addition over Ga1 ions. This allows for the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments, which decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides, leading to stable and selective ethylene production.

The alkyl mechanism applies differently depending on the Ga species structure. For reduced Ga/ZSM-5, the mechanism involves weak adsorption, oxidative addition, and subsequent decomposition into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. For zinc-modified ZSM-5, the mechanism includes strong adsorption, heterolytic dissociation, and coke formation.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢(PDH)反应中，丙烷在还原态Ga/ZSM-5上的吸附较弱。在高温下，丙烷通过氧化插入到单价Ga1离子上进行激活，形成连接在镓上的乙基和氢化物片段。这些片段进一步分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物，导致乙烯的稳定且选择性的生成。

相比之下，卡本离子机制通常涉及在锌基催化剂上的丙烷吸附。丙烷通过锌离子强烈极化，导致随后加热时发生异裂，形成锌乙基片段和一个质子，从而再生出Brnsted酸性基团。这促进了丙烷转化为芳香族产物和焦炭的生成。

丙烷活化步骤被提议为速率决定步骤(RDS)，因为在镓基催化剂上的丙烷活化过程中，丙烷的吸附较弱，并且随后通过氧化插入到Ga1离子上进行。这允许形成乙基和氢化物片段，它们进一步分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物，导致稳定的乙烯生成。

根据Ga物种结构的不同，该机制的应用也有所不同。对于还原态Ga/ZSM-5，机制涉及弱吸附、氧化插入和随后的分解为乙烯和镓二氢化合物。而对于锌修饰的ZSM-5，机制包括强吸附、异裂以及焦炭形成。
