[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[2] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[3] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[4] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[5] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

Ethane activation over Zn/ZSM-5 occurs through a mechanism where ethane is strongly adsorbed at room temperature, leading to a high degree of polarizability. Upon heating, the complex dissociates over the Lewis acid sites, generating Brnsted acid protons. In contrast, ethane activation over Ga/ZSM-5 occurs via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures, resulting in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments. These fragments decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. The lack of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 allows for a stable and selective conversion of ethane to ethylene. Meanwhile, Zn/ZSM-5 exhibits higher initial activity but experiences coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the creation of Brnsted acidity.

在Zn/ZSM-5上，乙烷激活通过机制发生，其中乙烷在室温下强烈吸附，导致高度极化。加热后，该复合物在Lewis酸位点上分解，产生Brnsted酸质子。相比之下，Ga/ZSM-5上的乙烷激活通过在高温下过氧化插入单价Ga1离子发生，导致乙基和氢化物碎片的形成。这些碎片分解成乙烯和镓二氢化合物。Ga/ZSM-5中缺乏Brnsted酸质子的形成允许乙烷稳定且选择性地转化为乙烯。同时，Zn/ZSM-5表现出更高的初始活性，但因产生Brnsted酸性而经历焦炭化失活和二次芳构化反应。
