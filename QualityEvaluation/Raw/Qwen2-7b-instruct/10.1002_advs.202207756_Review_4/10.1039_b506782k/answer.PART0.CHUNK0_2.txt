[1] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon."
[2] "Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21-basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[3] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[4] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[5] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[6] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The alkyl mechanism for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves a series of steps where propane is initially activated through oxidative addition to univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures. This process leads to the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments that coordinate to Ga31 species. These fragments then decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which is more commonly associated with PDH reactions on other types of catalysts. The CH activation step is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it is the most critical and time-consuming step in the entire process. The alkyl mechanism applies differently depending on the structure of the Ga species, with reduced Ga/ZSM-5 exhibiting a more stable and selective conversion of propane to ethylene due to the absence of Brnsted acid proton formation, whereas Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from deactivation and secondary reactions due to the formation of Brnsted acidity.

烷基机制在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应涉及一系列步骤，其中丙烷首先通过氧化添加到升高的温度下的一价Ga1离子上进行激活。这一过程导致乙基和氢化物片段形成并协调到Ga31物种。这些片段随后在进一步加热时分解成乙烯和镓二氢化合物。这种机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者通常与其它类型的催化剂上的PDH反应相关联。CH激活步骤被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它在整个过程中是最关键且耗时最多的步骤。根据Ga物种的不同结构，烷基机制的应用也有所不同，由于缺乏Brnsted酸质子形成，减少的Ga/ZSM-5表现出更稳定和选择性的丙烷转化为乙烯，而Zn/ZSM-5则显示出更高的初始活性，但由于形成Brnsted酸性，导致催化剂失活和次级反应。
