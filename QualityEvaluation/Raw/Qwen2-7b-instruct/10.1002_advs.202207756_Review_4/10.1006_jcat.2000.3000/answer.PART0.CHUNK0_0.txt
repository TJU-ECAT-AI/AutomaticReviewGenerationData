[1] "Propane adsorbed weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K. A stronger interaction occurred above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne were observed."
[2] "Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane: the highest selectivity to propylene is 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K."
[3] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."
[4] "The favorable effect of Mo2C can be explained by its high activity toward the dehydrogenation of propane."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, followed by the abstraction of a hydride ion to form a propyl carbocation intermediate. This intermediate then undergoes a series of rearrangements and reactions leading to the formation of propylene and other hydrocarbons. In comparison, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a propyl carbenium ion, which also undergoes rearrangements to form propylene. The activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it requires the highest energy input and thus limits the overall reaction rate. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by adapting to the local coordination environment of the Ga atom, influencing the stability and reactivity of the propyl intermediate.

In the context of the provided literature, the alkyl mechanism is not specifically discussed for gallium-based catalysts. However, it can be inferred that the mechanism might involve a similar series of steps, with propane being activated by the gallium surface, leading to the formation of a propyl intermediate that undergoes rearrangements to produce propylene. The carbenium mechanism is another potential pathway, where a propyl carbenium ion forms and reacts to produce propylene. The activation step, whether it involves the alkyl or carbenium mechanism, is typically the rate-limiting step in PDH reactions.

The favorable effect of Mo2C, as mentioned in the literature, can be applied to gallium-based catalysts by understanding how the dispersion of Mo2C on the surface affects the reactivity and selectivity towards propane dehydrogenation. The high activity of Mo2C towards dehydrogenation could enhance the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium catalysts by promoting faster activation of propane and more selective formation of propylene.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷的初始活化，随后通过脱氢化氢离子形成丙基碳正离子中间体。该中间体随后经历一系列重排和反应，导致丙烯和其它烃类的生成。与之对比的是，碳烯机制涉及到形成一个丙基碳烯离子，该离子也经历一系列重排以生成丙烯。激活步骤被视为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它需要最高的能量输入，并且限制了整体反应速率。烷基机制适用于不同的Ga物种结构，通过适应Ga原子周围的局部配位环境来影响丙基中间体的稳定性和反应性。

在提供的文献中，没有具体讨论镓基催化剂中的烷基机制。然而，可以推断，机制可能涉及类似的一系列步骤，其中丙烷被镓表面活化，导致形成丙基中间体，进而经历重排以产生丙烯。碳烯机制是另一种潜在途径，其中形成一个丙基碳烯离子并反应以产生丙烯。激活步骤，无论是烷基还是碳烯机制，通常都是PDH反应的决定性步骤。

文献中提到Mo2C的有利效果可以应用于镓基催化剂，通过理解Mo2C在表面的分散如何影响活性和丙烷脱氢的选择性。Mo2C的高活性对于促进镓催化剂中的PDH反应效率具有重要作用，通过加快丙烷的活化和更选择性地形成丙烯。
