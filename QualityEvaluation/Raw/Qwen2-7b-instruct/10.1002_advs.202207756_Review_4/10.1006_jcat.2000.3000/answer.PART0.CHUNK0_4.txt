[1] "Propane adsorbed weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K. A stronger interaction occurred above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne were observed."
[2] "Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane: the highest selectivity to propylene is 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K."
[3] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. This mechanism typically starts with the activation of propane, where the carbon-hydrogen bonds are broken under the influence of heat or catalysts. The resulting alkyl groups are then involved in a series of rearrangements and transformations leading to the formation of alkenes, alkynes, and eventually the desired products such as propylene. 

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves fewer energy barriers and can proceed more efficiently. This is particularly advantageous in industrial applications where high conversion rates and selectivities are crucial.

The activation step is critical in the alkyl mechanism, as it determines the subsequent reactivity of the alkyl groups. This step can involve the breaking of one or more C-H bonds, leading to the formation of an alkyl radical or an alkyl cation. The stability and reactivity of the resulting alkyl species are influenced by the nature of the catalyst and the surrounding conditions.

Regarding the carbenium mechanism, it typically involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes further transformations to produce the final products. This mechanism is usually associated with higher energy barriers and thus potentially slower reaction rates compared to the alkyl mechanism.

The specific structure of gallium species in the catalyst can significantly impact the mechanism's efficiency and the types of products formed. Different gallium species might exhibit distinct reactivities, influencing the activation energy, the stability of intermediates, and the overall reaction pathway.

In summary, the alkyl mechanism provides a straightforward pathway for propane dehydrogenation, with activation being the rate-determining step. Its efficiency and simplicity make it a preferred choice in many industrial processes. However, the exact mechanism can vary depending on the specific catalyst and operating conditions.

The favorable effect of Mo2C on propane dehydrogenation is attributed to its high activity toward the dehydrogenation of propane, leading to the formation of propylene. This contrasts with the reactions on ZSM-5, where the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane. The change in reaction pathway is attributed to the capability of ZSM-5 to aromatize propylene produced over Mo2C, demonstrating the complex interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms, and product distributions.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的GaN催化剂上涉及几个关键步骤，从初始丙烷活化到产物形成。这个机制通常以丙烷激活开始，碳-氢键在热量或催化剂的作用下被断裂。随后，生成的烷基团参与一系列重组和转化，最终形成烯烃、炔烃以及所需的产物如丙烯。

与卡宾离子机制相比，烷基机制常被视为决定性步骤（RDS），因为它涉及较少的能量壁垒，可以更高效地进行。这对于工业应用中高转化率和选择性至关重要。

激活步骤是烷基机制的关键，决定了后续烷基团的反应活性。这一步可能涉及一个或多个C-H键的断裂，导致烷基自由基或烷基正离子的形成。烷基物种的稳定性和反应性受到催化剂性质和周围条件的影响。

关于卡宾离子机制，它通常涉及形成卡宾离子中间体，然后进一步转化为最终产物。这种机制通常与较高的能量壁垒相关联，从而可能导致较慢的反应速率，与烷基机制相比。

不同GaN物种的具体结构可以显著影响机制的效率和形成的产物类型。不同的GaN物种可能表现出不同的反应性，影响激活能、中间体稳定性以及总体反应途径。

简而言之，烷基机制为丙烷脱氢提供了一条直接路径，其中激活是决定性步骤。其效率和简单性使其成为许多工业过程的首选。然而，具体机制可能会根据特定催化剂和操作条件而有所不同。

钼2C对丙烷脱氢的有利影响归因于其高活性，促进了丙烷的脱氢，进而形成了丙烯。这与ZSM-5上的反应形成鲜明对比，在ZSM-5上，主要反应是丙烷的芳香化。反应途径的变化归因于ZSM-5能够将Mo2C产生的丙烯芳香化的能力，展示了催化剂结构、反应机制和产物分布之间的复杂相互作用。
