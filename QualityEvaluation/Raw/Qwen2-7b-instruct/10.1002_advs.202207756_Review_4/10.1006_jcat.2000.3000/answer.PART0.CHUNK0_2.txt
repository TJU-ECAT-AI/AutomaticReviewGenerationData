[1] "Propane adsorbed weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K. A stronger interaction occurred above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne were observed."
[2] "Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane: the highest selectivity to propylene is 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K."
[3] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."
[4] "The favorable effect of Mo2C can be explained by its high activity toward the dehydrogenation of propane. The results obtained for Mo2C/SiO2 clearly showed that Mo2C is an effective catalyst to produce propylene from propane."
[5] "The change in the reaction route is attributed to the capability of ZSM-5 to aromatize propylene produced over Mo2C."

(i) Propane binds weakly to supported Mo2C at temperatures below 273 K. At higher temperatures, starting around 300 K, stronger interactions occur, leading to the observation of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne vibrations.
(ii) Depositing Mo2C on silica creates an efficient catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, achieving a 50% selectivity for propylene at a 25% conversion rate at 873 K.
(iii) The reaction pathway for propane over Mo2C/ZSM-5 is distinct, with the main reaction being the aromatization of propane.
(iv) The effectiveness of Mo2C in dehydrogenating propane is attributed to its high activity, as evidenced by its capability to convert propane into propylene on Mo2C/SiO2 samples.
(v) The shift in the reaction pathway is explained by ZSM-5's ability to aromatize propylene produced over Mo2C, influencing the overall catalytic process.

(i) 在低于273 K的温度下，丙烷与支持的Mo2C以弱的和可逆的方式结合。在高于300 K时，发生更强的相互作用，观察到吸附的丙烯和丙基二烯振动。
(ii) 将Mo2C沉积在硅酸盐上产生有效的脱氢催化剂，能够在873 K时实现丙烷向丙烯的转化，选择性达到50%，转化率为25%。
(iii) 在Mo2C/ZSM-5上的丙烷反应路径是独特的，主要反应是丙烷的芳香化。
(iv) Mo2C在脱氢反应中的有效性归因于其高活性，这在Mo2C/SiO2样品中催化丙烷转化为丙烯的过程中得到了证实。
(v) 反应路径的变化被解释为由于ZSM-5能够芳香化由Mo2C产生的丙烯，从而影响整体催化过程。
