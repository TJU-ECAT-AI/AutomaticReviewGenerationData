[1] "Propane adsorbed weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K. A stronger interaction occurred above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne were observed."
[2] "Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane: the highest selectivity to propylene is 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K."
[3] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, followed by a series of steps where the alkyl groups undergo rearrangement, leading to the formation of lighter hydrocarbons. The key steps typically include the breaking of the C-H bonds, the formation of a carbenium ion, and the subsequent loss of hydrogen to form the desired product. This mechanism is proposed because it facilitates the direct cleavage of the alkyl group without the need for a separate activation step, thus being more efficient.

Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism might be faster due to the absence of an additional activation energy barrier associated with the formation of a carbenium ion. The CH activation step is often considered the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the most energetically demanding transition state, requiring significant activation energy.

In different Ga species structures, the alkyl mechanism can apply differently depending on the coordination environment of the Ga center, which influences the stability and reactivity of the resulting intermediates. For example, in octahedral Ga complexes, the alkyl groups might stabilize the intermediate via steric hindrance or by forming hydrogen bonds, altering the pathway and kinetics of the PDH reaction.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制涉及丙烷的初始活化，随后一系列步骤中烷基团进行重排，形成较轻的烃类。关键步骤通常包括C-H键的断裂、形成碳正离子和随后丢失氢原子形成所需产物。这种机制被提出是因为它可以直接切割烷基团，而无需额外的活化步骤，因此更为有效。

与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制可能更快，因为缺少形成碳正离子所需的额外活化能壁垒。CH活化步骤经常被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它涉及最耗能的过渡态，需要大量的活化能。

在不同的Ga物种结构中，烷基机制的应用可能会根据Ga中心的配位环境不同而有所不同，这影响了中间体的稳定性和反应性。例如，在八面体Ga复合物中，烷基团可能通过空间阻碍或形成氢键来稳定中间体，从而改变反应路径和动力学。
