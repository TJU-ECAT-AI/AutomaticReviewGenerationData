The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane molecules, followed by a series of rearrangements that lead to the formation of propylene. This mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of propane onto the gallium surface, where the primary carbon atom is activated through a series of bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions. The alkyl group then undergoes a cyclopropane transition state before converting into propylene. 

In comparison, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to produce propylene. The activation of propane in this mechanism is generally faster due to the stabilization of the carbenium ion.

The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it is the slowest step in the sequence of reactions. This step involves the breaking of a C-H bond, which requires a substantial amount of energy. 

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to different Ga species structures. The specific structure of gallium can influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity, depending on factors such as the surface composition, the size of the gallium clusters, and the presence of other catalyst components. Different Ga species can lead to variations in the activation energies and reaction pathways, affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the PDH process.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制涉及丙烷分子的活化，随后进行一系列重组，最终形成丙烯。这一机制通常从丙烷分子吸附到镓表面开始，其中主碳原子通过一系列键断裂和键形成的反应被激活。随后，烷基团经历一个环丙烷过渡态，最终转化为丙烯。

与之相比，卡宾机制涉及到卡宾离子中间体的形成，然后进行一系列反应以产生丙烯。丙烷的活化在这个机制中通常更快，因为卡宾离子的稳定化。

在PDH反应中，CH活化步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它是一系列反应中最慢的步骤。这一步涉及C-H键的断裂，需要大量的能量。

烷基机制对于不同的Ga物种结构有不同的应用。镓的具体结构可以影响反应动力学和产物选择性，取决于表面组成、镓簇的大小以及是否存在其他催化剂组分等因素。不同的Ga物种可能导致激活能和反应途径的变化，影响PDH过程的效率和有效性。

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, followed by the formation of an alkyl cation intermediate. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which typically involves the formation of a carbenium ion. The activation step of alkyl cations is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions due to its critical role in the conversion of propane to propene. The mechanism applies to various gallium species structures, each potentially affecting the reaction kinetics and selectivity.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane molecules. The mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface. Subsequently, the alkyl group undergoes activation, which is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). This activation process leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. From this intermediate, the alkene products are formed through further reaction steps. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the carbenium ion is the central species involved in the reaction pathway.

In the context of different Ga species structures, the alkyl mechanism applies differently depending on the specific Ga species and its interaction with the substrate. The key steps—initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl activation, and product formation—remain consistent across various Ga species, but the efficiency and selectivity may vary due to differences in the catalytic properties of the Ga species.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷分子的初始活化。该机制通常从丙烷吸附到催化剂表面开始。随后，烷基团经历活化，这通常被提议为决定性步骤（RDS）。这一活化过程导致形成碳阳离子中间体。从这个中间体开始，通过进一步的反应步骤形成烯烃产物。与碳烯离子机制相比，其中碳烯离子是反应途径的核心物种，这种机制存在差异。

在不同Ga物种结构的背景下，烷基机制在不同的Ga物种及其对底物的相互作用中应用有所不同。尽管关键步骤——初始丙烷活化、后续烷基活化和产物形成——在整个各种Ga物种中保持一致，但由于催化性质的差异，效率和选择性可能会有所不同。

Autoclaving at 120°C for 20, 40, and 60 minutes did not significantly alter the spectral intensities of the carbonyl C-O ester group and lipid unsaturation group (CH attached to C-C) in flaxseed, with average spectral peak area intensities of 138 and 69 IR intensity units, respectively. Instead, it notably changed the ratio profiles of the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric stretching band vibration intensity. Multivariate molecular spectral analyses, such as hierarchical cluster analysis (CLA) and principal components analysis (PCA), were unable to differentiate between the treatment spectra in the asymmetric and symmetric CH3 and CH2 region (around 2988-2790 cm−1). The findings suggest that autoclaving affected the mid-IR spectrum of flaxseed, identifying alterations in lipid conformation due to heat exposure.

在120°C下进行20、40和60分钟的自蒸煮并未显著改变亚麻籽中碳氧羰基团和脂质不饱和度组（与C-C相连的CH）的光谱强度，分别具有138和69 IR强度单位的平均光谱峰值面积。相反，它显著改变了CH2不对称伸缩振动强度比到CH3不对称伸缩振动强度。多变量分子光谱分析，如层次聚类分析（CLA）和主成分分析（PCA），无法在2988-2790 cm−1的不对称和对称CH3和CH2区域区分处理光谱。这些发现表明，自蒸煮影响了亚麻籽的中红外光谱，识别了由热暴露引起的脂质构象变化。
