The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane molecules. The mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of propane onto the catalyst surface. Subsequently, the alkyl group undergoes activation, which is often proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS). This activation process leads to the formation of a carbocation intermediate. From this intermediate, the alkene products are formed through further reaction steps. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the carbenium ion is the central species involved in the reaction pathway.

In the context of different Ga species structures, the alkyl mechanism applies differently depending on the specific Ga species and its interaction with the substrate. The key steps—initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl activation, and product formation—remain consistent across various Ga species, but the efficiency and selectivity may vary due to differences in the catalytic properties of the Ga species.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷分子的初始活化。该机制通常从丙烷吸附到催化剂表面开始。随后，烷基团经历活化，这通常被提议为决定性步骤（RDS）。这一活化过程导致形成碳阳离子中间体。从这个中间体开始，通过进一步的反应步骤形成烯烃产物。与碳烯离子机制相比，其中碳烯离子是反应途径的核心物种，这种机制存在差异。

在不同Ga物种结构的背景下，烷基机制在不同的Ga物种及其对底物的相互作用中应用有所不同。尽管关键步骤——初始丙烷活化、后续烷基活化和产物形成——在整个各种Ga物种中保持一致，但由于催化性质的差异，效率和选择性可能会有所不同。
