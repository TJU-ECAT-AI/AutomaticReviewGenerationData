[1] "Hierarchical cluster analysis (CLA) and principal components analysis (PCA) were conducted to identify molecular spectral differences."
[2] "The parameters that we investigated were spectral intensity of the functional groups mainly associated with lipid biopolymer, including lipid CH3 asymmetric (ca. 2959 cm1), CH2 asymmetric (ca. 2928 cm1), CH3 symmetric (ca. 2871 cm1) and CH2 symmetric (ca. 2954 cm1) groups, lipid 1386-1425/$ see front matter 2011 Elsevier B.V.

[3] "Multivariate molecular spectral analyses, CLA and PCA, were unable to make distinctions between the different treatment original spectra at the CH3 and CH2 asymmetric and symmetric region (ca. 29882790 cm1)."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, followed by the formation of an alkyl cation intermediate. This mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which typically involves the formation of a carbenium ion. The activation step of alkyl cations is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions due to its critical role in the conversion of propane to propene. The mechanism applies to various gallium species structures, each potentially affecting the reaction kinetics and selectivity.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及丙烷的初始活化，随后形成烷基阳离子中间体。该机制与通常形成碳烯离子的碳烯机制不同。烷基离子的激活步骤被认为是PDH反应中的速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它在将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程中起着关键作用。该机制适用于各种镓物种结构，每种结构可能会影响反应动力学和选择性。
