Autoclaving at 120°C for 20, 40, and 60 minutes did not significantly alter the spectral intensities of the carbonyl C-O ester group and lipid unsaturation group (CH attached to C-C) in flaxseed, with average spectral peak area intensities of 138 and 69 IR intensity units, respectively. Instead, it notably changed the ratio profiles of the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric stretching band vibration intensity. Multivariate molecular spectral analyses, such as hierarchical cluster analysis (CLA) and principal components analysis (PCA), were unable to differentiate between the treatment spectra in the asymmetric and symmetric CH3 and CH2 region (around 2988-2790 cm−1). The findings suggest that autoclaving affected the mid-IR spectrum of flaxseed, identifying alterations in lipid conformation due to heat exposure.

在120°C下进行20、40和60分钟的自蒸煮并未显著改变亚麻籽中碳氧羰基团和脂质不饱和度组（与C-C相连的CH）的光谱强度，分别具有138和69 IR强度单位的平均光谱峰值面积。相反，它显著改变了CH2不对称伸缩振动强度比到CH3不对称伸缩振动强度。多变量分子光谱分析，如层次聚类分析（CLA）和主成分分析（PCA），无法在2988-2790 cm−1的不对称和对称CH3和CH2区域区分处理光谱。这些发现表明，自蒸煮影响了亚麻籽的中红外光谱，识别了由热暴露引起的脂质构象变化。
