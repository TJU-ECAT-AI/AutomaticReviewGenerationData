1. The study focused on analyzing the spectral intensity of functional groups associated with lipid biopolymers in flaxseed, including CH3 asymmetric (ca. 2959 cm1), CH2 asymmetric (ca. 2928 cm1), CH3 symmetric (ca. 2871 cm1), and CH2 symmetric (ca. 2954 cm1) groups, as well as carbonyl C O ester group and lipid unsaturation group (CH attached to C C).

2. Autoclaving at 120°C for 20, 40, and 60 minutes did not significantly alter the spectral intensities of the carbonyl C O ester group and lipid unsaturation group.

3. Autoclaving had a significant effect on changing the ratio profiles of the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric stretching band vibration intensity.

1. 研究主要关注分析与脂质多聚体相关的功能团在亚麻籽中的光谱强度，包括CH3不对称（约2959 cm1）、CH2不对称（约2928 cm1）、CH3对称（约2871 cm1）和CH2对称（约2954 cm1）组，以及羰基CO酯组和脂饱和度组（C连接到C的CH）。

2. 在当前条件下，120°C下进行20、40和60分钟的蒸汽压力处理并未显著改变羰基CO酯组和脂饱和度组的光谱强度。

3. 蒸汽压力处理显著改变了CH2不对称到CH3不对称伸展带振动强度的比例。
