<p>The results indicated that autoclaving had an impact to the mid-infrared molecular spectrum of flaxseed to identify heat-induced changes in lipid conformation.</p>
<p>Autoclaving under the current conditions at 120 C for 20, 40 and 60 min had no significant effect on spectral intensities of the carbonyl C O ester group and lipid unsaturation group (CH attached to C C) with average spectral peak area intensities of 138 and 69 IR intensity units, respectively.</p>
<p>However, the autoclaving had significantly changed the ratio profiles of the CH2 asymmetric to CH3 asymmetric stretching band vibration intensity.</p>
<p>Multivariate molecular spectral analyses, CLA and PCA, were unable to make distinctions between the different treatments in original spectra at the asymmetric and symmetric CH3 and CH2 region (ca. 29882790 cm1).</p>

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the activation of propane molecules, followed by a series of rearrangements that lead to the formation of propylene. This mechanism typically starts with the adsorption of propane onto the gallium surface, where the primary carbon atom is activated through a series of bond-breaking and bond-forming reactions. The alkyl group then undergoes a cyclopropane transition state before converting into propylene. 

In comparison, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to produce propylene. The activation of propane in this mechanism is generally faster due to the stabilization of the carbenium ion.

The CH activation step is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions because it is the slowest step in the sequence of reactions. This step involves the breaking of a C-H bond, which requires a substantial amount of energy. 

The alkyl mechanism applies differently to different Ga species structures. The specific structure of gallium can influence the reaction kinetics and product selectivity, depending on factors such as the surface composition, the size of the gallium clusters, and the presence of other catalyst components. Different Ga species can lead to variations in the activation energies and reaction pathways, affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of the PDH process.

在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制涉及丙烷分子的活化，随后进行一系列重组，最终形成丙烯。这一机制通常从丙烷分子吸附到镓表面开始，其中主碳原子通过一系列键断裂和键形成的反应被激活。随后，烷基团经历一个环丙烷过渡态，最终转化为丙烯。

与之相比，卡宾机制涉及到卡宾离子中间体的形成，然后进行一系列反应以产生丙烯。丙烷的活化在这个机制中通常更快，因为卡宾离子的稳定化。

在PDH反应中，CH活化步骤被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它是一系列反应中最慢的步骤。这一步涉及C-H键的断裂，需要大量的能量。

烷基机制对于不同的Ga物种结构有不同的应用。镓的具体结构可以影响反应动力学和产物选择性，取决于表面组成、镓簇的大小以及是否存在其他催化剂组分等因素。不同的Ga物种可能导致激活能和反应途径的变化，影响PDH过程的效率和有效性。
