The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism provides a simpler understanding of the reaction process.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts consists of several key steps: initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. Among these steps, the activation process is identified as the rate-determining step (RDS) because of its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. Different Ga species structures influence the alkyl mechanism by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts begins with the activation of propane, followed by the insertion of a gallium atom into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl group. This process is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high energy barrier and the sequential nature of the reaction. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products. Activation of propane and the subsequent insertion of gallium into the C-H bond are key steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. Different gallium species structures can impact the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, influencing their catalytic characteristics.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the formation of dihydridogallium ions under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures, which slowly decompose under inert gas flow and rapidly decompose when hydrogen is replaced by propane. The formation of this species can be represented by reaction (14): ZGa+ + H2 → ZGaH2+. It is suggested that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of reaction (19). A possible reaction scheme for catalyst activation and the first steps in the aromatization reaction is proposed. Dihydridogallium cations were never detected under propane flow, indicating they cannot be the active sites for alkane activation. When hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species rapidly transform into alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected, confirming that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, followed by the cleavage of the C-H bonds to form alkyl radicals. These alkyl radicals then react with oxygen or other reactants to form products such as propylene, ethylene, and methane. The key steps include the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane to form a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to form the desired product. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the formation of a carbenium ion rather than an alkyl radical as the intermediate. This mechanism is often observed in reactions where the formation of a positively charged carbon center is energetically favorable. The activation of the CH group is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it is the slowest step in the reaction sequence. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, as well as the subsequent steps in the mechanism, depend significantly on the activation of the CH group. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the electronic properties of gallium to stabilize the alkyl radical intermediate. Gallium's ability to donate electrons to the alkyl radical helps in stabilizing it and facilitating its reactivity towards other molecules. The specific structure of the Ga species, such as its coordination environment and surface defects, can influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the electronic properties of gallium to stabilize the alkyl radical intermediate. Gallium's ability to donate electrons to the alkyl radical helps in stabilizing it and facilitating its reactivity towards other molecules. The specific structure of the Ga species, such as its coordination environment and surface defects, can influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.
