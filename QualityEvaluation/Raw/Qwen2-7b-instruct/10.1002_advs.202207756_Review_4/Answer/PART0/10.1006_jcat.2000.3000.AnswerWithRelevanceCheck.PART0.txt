          [1] "Propane adsorbed weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K. A stronger interaction occurred above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne were observed."
          [2] "Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane: the highest selectivity to propylene is 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K."
          [3] "The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5. In this case the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane."

          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the initial activation of propane, followed by the cleavage of the C-H bonds to form alkyl radicals. These alkyl radicals then react with oxygen or other reactants to form products such as propylene, ethylene, and methane. The key steps include the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane to form a carbocation intermediate, which then undergoes rearrangement to form the desired product. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the formation of a carbenium ion rather than an alkyl radical as the intermediate. This mechanism is often observed in reactions where the formation of a positively charged carbon center is energetically favorable. The activation of the CH group is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) in the alkyl mechanism because it is the slowest step in the reaction sequence. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, as well as the subsequent steps in the mechanism, depend significantly on the activation of the CH group. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the electronic properties of gallium to stabilize the alkyl radical intermediate. Gallium's ability to donate electrons to the alkyl radical helps in stabilizing it and facilitating its reactivity towards other molecules. The specific structure of the Ga species, such as its coordination environment and surface defects, can influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

          烷基机制在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及丙烷的初始活化，随后通过断裂C-H键形成烷基自由基。这些烷基自由基然后与氧气或其他反应物反应形成产品，如丙烯、乙烯和甲烷。关键步骤包括从丙烷中抽象一个氢原子形成碳正离子中间体，该中间体随后发生重排形成所需的产品。相比之下，碳正离子机制涉及形成碳正离子而非烷基自由基作为中间体。这种机制通常在形成正电荷碳中心的能量有利的情况下观察到。在烷基机制中，CH组的激活被认为是速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它是在反应序列中最慢的步骤。烷基自由基的稳定性及其随后步骤的反应性依赖于CH组的激活。不同镓物种结构中的烷基机制通过利用镓的电子性质稳定烷基自由基中间体来适用。镓能够向烷基自由基捐赠电子，有助于稳定它并促进其与其他分子的反应性。镓物种的具体结构，如其配位环境和表面缺陷，可以影响PDH反应的反应性和选择性。

          The favorable effect of Mo2C on propane dehydrogenation is attributed to its high activity toward the dehydrogenation of propane, leading to the formation of propylene. This contrasts with the reactions on ZSM-5, where the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane. The change in reaction pathway is attributed to the capability of ZSM-5 to aromatize propylene produced over Mo2C, demonstrating the complex interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms, and product distributions.

          钼2C对丙烷脱氢的有利影响归因于其高活性，促进了丙烷的脱氢，进而形成了丙烯。这与ZSM-5上的反应形成对比，在ZSM-5上，主要反应是丙烷的芳香化。反应途径的变化归因于ZSM-5能够将Mo2C产生的丙烯芳香化的能力，展示了催化剂结构、反应机制和产物分布之间的复杂相互作用。
