The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves initial propane activation leading to the formation of an alkyl cation, with the CH activation step identified as the rate-determining step (RDS). This mechanism is compared to the carbenium mechanism, and the reasons for considering the CH activation step as the RDS are discussed. The mechanism's applicability to different gallium species structures is also explored.

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts suggests that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs through reactions (17) and (18) rather than the sequence analyzed by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, where dihydridogallium ions act as active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, represented by reaction (20), is considered a likely possibility, involving the activation of gallium species (ZOGa+) with alkyl groups (CH3)(C2H5) and hydride (ZOGaH2) to produce methane (CH4) and hexane (C2H6).

The favorable effect of Mo2C on propane dehydrogenation is attributed to its high activity toward the dehydrogenation of propane, leading to the formation of propylene. This contrasts with the reactions on ZSM-5, where the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane. The change in reaction pathway is attributed to the capability of ZSM-5 to aromatize propylene produced over Mo2C, demonstrating the complex interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms, and product distributions.
