This contrasts with the reactions on ZSM-5, where the dominant reaction is the aromatization of propane. The change in reaction pathway is attributed to the capability of ZSM-5 to aromatize propylene produced over Mo2C, demonstrating the complex interplay between catalyst structure, reaction mechanisms, and product distributions.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.2000.3000"},
