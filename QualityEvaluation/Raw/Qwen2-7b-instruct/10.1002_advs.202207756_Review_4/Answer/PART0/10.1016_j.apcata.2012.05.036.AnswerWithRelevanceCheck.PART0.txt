          [9] "The results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum."

          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the formation of dihydridogallium ions under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures, which slowly decompose under inert gas flow and rapidly decompose when hydrogen is replaced by propane. The formation of this species can be represented by reaction (14): ZGa+ + H2 → ZGaH2+. It is suggested that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of reaction (19). A possible reaction scheme for catalyst activation and the first steps in the aromatization reaction is proposed. Dihydridogallium cations were never detected under propane flow, indicating they cannot be the active sites for alkane activation. When hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species rapidly transform into alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected, confirming that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

          在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制涉及在芳香化温度下在氢气中形成二氢镓离子，这些离子在惰性气体流动下缓慢分解，并在氢气被丙烷替代时迅速分解。这个物种的形成可以用反应（14）表示：ZGa+ + H2 → ZGaH2+。建议该烷基中间体的分解通过反应（17）和（18）而不是反应（19）发生。提出了催化剂激活和芳香化反应初期步骤的可能反应方案。在丙烷流下，未检测到二氢镓离子，这表明它们不能作为烷烃活化位点。当氢气被丙烷替代时，二氢物种迅速转化为烷基镓离子。在丙烷流下，未检测到二氢镓离子，这证实了当氢与丙烷竞争活性位点时，氢解离活性达到最大值。

          [1] "Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead."
          [2] "A sequence of steps that corresponds essentially to reaction (19) has been analyzed by Frash and van Santen [24] in their theoretical study of ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites."
          [3] "Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversal of reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatisation."
          [4] "A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility: ZOGa+(CH3)(C2H5) + ZOGaH2 + 2ZOGa+ + C2H6 + CH4."

          The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts suggests that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs through reactions (17) and (18) rather than the sequence analyzed by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, where dihydridogallium ions act as active sites. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, represented by reaction (20), is considered a likely possibility, involving the activation of gallium species (ZOGa+) with alkyl groups (CH3)(C2H5) and hydride (ZOGaH2) to produce methane (CH4) and hexane (C2H6).

          在镓基催化剂上的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制表明，烷基氢化产物的分解通过反应（17）和（18）发生，而不是弗拉什和范桑特在他们的理论研究中分析的乙烷激活过程中的镓交换沸石，其中二氢镓离子作为活性位点。兰格缪尔-希恩伍德类型机制，表示为反应（20），被认为是可能的，涉及使用烷基团（CH3）（C2H5）和氢化物（ZOGaH2）激活的镓物种（ZOGa+），以产生甲烷（CH4）和己烷（C2H6）。
