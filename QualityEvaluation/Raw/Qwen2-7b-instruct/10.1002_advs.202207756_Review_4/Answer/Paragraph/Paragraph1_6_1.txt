        The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts has been extensively studied, revealing several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The mechanism begins with the activation of propane, followed by the insertion of a gallium atom into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl group. This process is considered the rate-determining step (RDS) due to its high energy barrier and the sequential nature of the reaction, making it the slowest step in the sequence. The activation of the CH group is pivotal in this mechanism, significantly impacting the overall reaction kinetics.

        Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process. The carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products. In contrast, the alkyl mechanism focuses on the cleavage of the C-H bond to form alkyl radicals, which react further to produce products like propylene, ethylene, and methane.

        The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic conversion. Different gallium species structures can alter the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thereby affecting the catalytic performance.

        The decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate in the alkyl mechanism occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of reaction (19), suggesting a distinct pathway for the breakdown of the intermediate. Computational modeling has shown that the formation of dihydridogallium ions under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures leads to rapid decomposition when hydrogen is replaced by propane. This fact indicates that dihydridogallium ions cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as previously proposed by some investigators. However, under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected, demonstrating that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

        Propane adsorbs weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K, but a stronger interaction occurs above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne are observed. Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane, showing the highest selectivity to propylene at 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K. The reaction pathway of propane over Mo2C/ZSM-5 is completely different, with the dominant reaction being the aromatization of propane.

        The activation step in the alkyl mechanism is crucial, as it is the RDS due to its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, along with the subsequent steps in the mechanism, are highly dependent on the activation of the CH group. The specific structure of the Ga species, including its coordination environment and surface defects, can significantly influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

        The computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI highlights the key steps of the alkyl mechanism and compares it to the carbenium mechanism. The proposed carbenium mechanism follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation compared to the alkyl mechanism, emphasizing the importance of understanding the specific mechanisms involved in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts.
        
        Different Ga species structures can influence the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, affecting their catalytic properties. The alkyl mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures is essential for optimizing the catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity.

        Looking ahead, the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts offers valuable insights into the reaction dynamics and catalytic processes. Future research efforts could focus on exploring the effects of different Ga species structures on the catalytic performance, identifying new catalyst designs, and enhancing the understanding of the underlying mechanisms to improve the efficiency and selectivity of PDH reactions.

        在使用镓基催化剂进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制已经被广泛研究，揭示了从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。该机制始于丙烷的活化，随后在C-H键上插入一个镓原子，形成烷基团。这一过程被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），因为它具有高能量壁垒和反应的顺序性质，是序列中最慢的步骤。CH基团的活化对于此机制至关重要，对整体反应动力学有显著影响。

        与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制提供了更直接的理解反应过程。碳正离子机制涉及形成碳正离子中间体，然后经历一系列反应形成所需的产品。相反，烷基机制专注于C-H键的断裂以形成烷基自由基，这些自由基进一步反应产生如丙烯、乙烯和甲烷等产品。

        烷基机制对不同Ga物种结构的应用有所不同，影响催化转化的选择性和效率。不同的镓物种结构可以改变激活和产品释放的具体相互作用和路径，从而影响催化性能。

        在烷基中间体的分解中，通过反应（17）和（18）而不是反应（19）发生，这表明中间体分解的特异性途径。计算建模显示，在芳香化温度下形成的二氢镓离子在氢被丙烷取代时会迅速分解。这表明二氢镓离子不能作为烷烃激活的活性位点，正如一些调查人员先前提出的那样。然而，在丙烷流动下，没有检测到二氢镓离子，证明了当氢与丙烷竞争活性位点时，氢解离活动达到最大值。

        丙烷在支持的Mo2C下以弱的可逆吸附形式存在，但在300 K以上，吸附的丙烯和丙炔振动显示出更强的相互作用。在二氧化硅上的Mo2C是一种有效的脱氢催化剂，表现出在873 K时丙烯选择性为50%，转化率为25%的最高选择性。在Mo2C/ZSM-5上的丙烷反应路径完全不同，主导反应是丙烷的芳构化。

        反应步骤在烷基机制中至关重要，因为它是决定性步骤，由于其对整体反应动力学的显著影响。烷基自由基的稳定性和反应性以及机制后续步骤依赖于CH基团的活化。镓物种的具体结构，包括其配位环境和表面缺陷，可以显著影响反应活性和选择性。

        对于镓/H-MFI催化轻烷烃脱氢的性质和作用的计算模型强调了烷基机制的关键步骤，并将其与碳正离子机制进行了比较。提出的碳正离子机制遵循与烷基机制不同的激活和产品形成路径，强调了解PDH反应中镓基催化剂作用机制的重要性。

        不同Ga物种结构可以影响赤铁矿沸石中的铝原子排列，影响其催化性质。烷基机制在不同Ga物种结构上的应用对于优化催化转化效率和选择性至关重要。

        展望未来，烷基机制在丙烷脱氢反应中的应用提供了关于反应动力学和催化过程的重要见解。未来的研究努力可能集中在探索不同Ga物种结构对催化性能的影响，识别新的催化剂设计，并增强对基本机制的理解以提高PDH反应的效率和选择性。
