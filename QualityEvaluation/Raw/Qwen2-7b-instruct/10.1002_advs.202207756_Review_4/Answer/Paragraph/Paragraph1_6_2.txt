        The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts has been extensively studied. The key steps of this mechanism, from initial propane activation to product formation, have been elucidated. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process. The activation of CH groups is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts, highlighting its critical role in the sequential nature of the reaction. Different Ga species structures apply differently to the mechanism, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic conversion.

        The activation of the propane molecule and the subsequent insertion of the gallium atom into the C-H bond are key steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of the PDH reaction on gallium-based catalysts. This process is considered the RDS due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, along with the subsequent steps in the mechanism, depend significantly on the activation of the CH group. The alkyl mechanism utilizes the electronic properties of gallium to stabilize the alkyl radical intermediate, with gallium's ability to donate electrons aiding in stabilizing the radical and facilitating its reactivity towards other molecules. The specific structure of the Ga species, including its coordination environment and surface defects, influences the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

        Computational modeling has further elucidated the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI. The key steps of the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts include initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. The proposed carbenium mechanism contrasts with the alkyl mechanism by following a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. The activation step is identified as the RDS, as it significantly impacts the overall reaction kinetics. Different Ga species structures modify the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, altering the catalytic properties of the system.

        The results from computational studies suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs through reactions (17) and (18) instead of the previously proposed reaction (19). A possible reaction scheme for catalyst activation and the first steps in the aromatization reaction is also provided. Dihydridogallium cations were never detected under propane flow, indicating they cannot serve as the active sites for alkane activation. When hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species rapidly transform into alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected, confirming that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

        The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5, with the dominant reaction being the aromatization of propane in this case. This highlights the unique characteristics and capabilities of gallium-based catalysts in PDH reactions, differing from those of supported Mo2C.

        The insights gained from studying the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts provide a deeper understanding of the reaction dynamics, the role of activation steps, and the influence of catalyst structure on the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic conversion. These findings contribute to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for propane dehydrogenation processes.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the integration of machine learning techniques to predict and optimize the performance of gallium-based catalysts under various operating conditions. Additionally, the exploration of novel gallium species structures with enhanced stability and reactivity could lead to improved selectivity and efficiency in PDH reactions. The incorporation of metal co-catalysts with gallium could also be a promising direction to further enhance the catalytic activity and broaden the scope of potential applications. Future work may also aim to develop in-situ characterization methods to gain real-time insights into the dynamic behavior of gallium-based catalysts during PDH reactions, providing a foundation for the design of more effective and sustainable catalytic systems.

        在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制已经被广泛研究。该机制的关键步骤，从丙烷的初始激活到产物形成，已经被详细阐述。与卡宾离子机制相比，烷基机制提供了更直观的反应过程理解。在PDH反应中，CH基团的活化被提议为决定性步骤（RDS），这强调了该反应序列中的能量壁垒和连续性。不同镓物种结构在机制中应用的方式影响着催化转换的选择性和效率。

        丙烷分子的激活以及随后镓原子插入C-H键，形成烷基，是烷基机制的关键步骤，显著提高了镓基催化剂下PDH反应的效率。这个过程被认为是RDS，因为它具有高能量壁垒和连续性质。烷基的稳定性和活性，以及后续步骤的机制，都显著依赖于CH基团的激活。烷基机制通过利用镓的电子特性来稳定烷基自由基中间体，镓能够捐赠电子帮助稳定自由基并促进其与其他分子的活性。镓物种的具体结构，包括其配位环境和表面缺陷，影响着PDH反应的活性和选择性。

        计算模型进一步阐明了镓物种在由Ga/H-MFI催化轻烷烃脱氢中的作用和角色。烷基机制在PDH反应中包含的关健步骤包括初始丙烷激活、随后的烷基迁移和最终产物形成。提出的卡宾离子机制与烷基机制形成对比，遵循不同的激活和产品形成路径。激活步骤被确认为RDS，因为它对整体反应动力学有重大影响。不同镓物种结构修改了激活和产物释放的特定相互作用和路径，改变了催化体系的性质。

        研究结果表明，烷基氢化物中间体的分解通过反应（17）和（18）发生，而不是之前提出的反应（19）。提供了一种催化剂激活和芳构化反应第一步的可能反应方案。在丙烷流下，未检测到二氢化镓离子，这表明它们不能作为烷烃激活的活性中心。当氢被丙烷取代时，二氢化镓物种迅速转化为烷基镓离子。在丙烷流下，未检测到二氢化镓离子，证实了当氢与丙烷竞争活性位点时，氢解离活动达到最大值。

        丙烷的反应途径在Mo2C/ZSM-5上完全不同，在这种情况下，主导反应是丙烷的芳构化。这突出了镓基催化剂在PDH反应中的独特特性和能力，与支持的Mo2C存在差异。

        从研究镓基催化剂上PDH反应中的烷基机制中获得的见解加深了我们对反应动态、激活步骤作用以及催化剂结构对催化转换效率和选择性影响的理解。这些发现有助于开发更高效和选择性的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢过程。
