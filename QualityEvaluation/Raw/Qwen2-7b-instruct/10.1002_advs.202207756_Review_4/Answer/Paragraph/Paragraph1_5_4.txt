        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295], [10.1021/jacs.9b13817], and [10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of the CH group is proposed as the RDS due to its high energy barrier and the sequential nature of the reaction. Different Ga species structures can influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of new gallium species structures designed to optimize the activation of CH groups, thereby enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction. Additionally, computational modeling could be employed to predict the behavior of various Ga species under different conditions, guiding the design of more effective catalysts. The exploration of synergistic effects between gallium-based catalysts and other metal or non-metal additives might also lead to enhanced catalytic performance.

        从参考文献[10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194]的深入研究中建立了详细的分析。综合理解源自参考文献[10.1021/acscatal.7b04295]、[10.1021/jacs.9b13817]和[10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]。烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及几大关键步骤：初始丙烷激活、CH基团的激活被认为是决定性步骤（RDS），以及不同Ga物种结构的应用影响催化转化效率和选择性。与碳正离子机制相比，烷基机制提供了更简洁的反应过程理解。CH基团的激活被提议为RDS，因为其具有高能垒和反应序列的性质。不同的Ga物种结构可以通过改变激活和产物释放的具体相互作用和途径来影响PDH反应的活性和选择性。
