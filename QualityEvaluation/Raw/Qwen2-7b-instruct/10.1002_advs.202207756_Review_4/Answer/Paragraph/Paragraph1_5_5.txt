        Detailed analysis of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts has been extensively conducted, revealing several key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. The process is characterized by the activation of CH groups, which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, offering a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process. The activation of the propane molecule and the subsequent insertion of the gallium atom into the C-H bond are pivotal steps contributing significantly to the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. 

        The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic conversion. For instance, the computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI indicates that the key steps of the alkyl mechanism involve initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. The proposed carbenium mechanism, in contrast, involves a distinct pathway for activation and product formation.

        Dihydridogallium ions formed under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures slowly decompose under inert gas flow but rapidly decompose when hydrogen is replaced by propane. Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs through reactions (17) and (18) instead of reaction (19). A possible reaction scheme for catalyst activation and the first steps in the aromatization reaction is proposed. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions were never detected, confirming that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

        The alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, where the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate leads to a series of reactions to form the desired products. The activation step is identified as the RDS due to its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. Different gallium species structures can influence the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, affecting their catalytic properties.

        The specific structure of the Ga species, such as its coordination environment and surface defects, plays a crucial role in determining the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction. For example, propane adsorbs weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K, but a stronger interaction occurs above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne are observed. Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane, with the highest selectivity to propylene at 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K. The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5, with the dominant reaction being the aromatization of propane.

        Integrating these insights, the alkyl mechanism provides a clearer understanding of the PDH process on gallium-based catalysts, highlighting the importance of the activation of CH groups and the role of gallium species structures in influencing catalytic efficiency. The future direction of research could focus on exploring the influence of specific gallium species structures on the PDH reaction pathway and identifying new catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity.

        对于在镓基催化剂上进行的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制进行了深入分析，揭示了从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的几个关键步骤。这一过程以活化CH基团为特征，并被认为是镓基催化剂上PDH反应的速率决定步骤（RDS）。该机制与碳烯离子机制形成对比，提供了对反应过程更直接的理解。丙烷分子的活化以及随后镓原子插入C-H键是贡献PDH反应效率的关键步骤。

        烷基机制在不同的镓物种结构下应用有所不同，影响催化转化的选择性和效率。例如，对于通过Ga/H-MFI催化轻烷烃脱氢的计算模型显示，烷基机制的关键步骤包括初始丙烷活化、随后的烷基迁移和最终产物形成。相比之下，提议的碳烯离子机制则遵循不同的激活和产品形成途径。

        在芳香化温度下形成的二氢镓离子在惰性气体流下缓慢分解，但在氢气被丙烷取代时迅速分解。我们的结果表明，烷基氢化物中间体的分解通过反应（17）和（18）发生，而不是反应（19）。提出了催化剂激活和芳香化反应的第一步的可能反应方案。在丙烷流下，未检测到二氢镓离子，证实了当氢气与丙烷竞争活性位点时，氢解作用达到最大。

        烷基机制与碳烯离子机制形成对比，在后者中，形成带正电的碳离子中间体后，一系列反应形成所需产物。识别激活步骤作为RDS，因为它对整体反应动力学有显著影响。不同镓物种结构可以影响钙沸石内铝原子的排列，从而影响其催化性质。

        镓物种的具体结构，如其配位环境和表面缺陷，对于确定PDH反应的活性和选择性起着关键作用。例如，丙烷在支持的Mo2C下273 K以下弱而可逆地吸附，但当振动的吸附丙烯和丙二烯在300 K以上时，发生更强的相互作用。在硅胶上分散的Mo2C是一种有效的脱氢催化剂，丙烷的最高选择性达到50%，在873 K时转化率为25%。在Mo2C/ZSM-5上，丙烷的反应途径完全不同，主导反应是丙烷的芳香化。

        结合这些见解，烷基机制为理解镓基催化剂上的PDH过程提供了清晰的视角，强调了活化CH基团的重要性以及特定镓物种结构对催化效率的影响。未来研究方向可以集中在探索特定镓物种结构对PDH反应途径的影响以及识别具有增强活性和选择性的新催化剂。
