        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295], [10.1021/jacs.9b13817], and [10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism provides a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of CH groups is proposed as the RDS in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures by altering the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.

        The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products. The carbenium mechanism contrasts with the alkyl mechanism in terms of pathway and intermediates. Different Ga species structures can significantly influence the catalytic properties, such as the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites.

        Computational modeling supports the understanding of the nature and role of Ga species in light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI. The key steps of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts include initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. The activation step is considered the RDS due to its impact on overall reaction kinetics. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thus affecting the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic conversion.

        The results demonstrate that while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum. This maximum indicates that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected, confirming the active role of propane in the mechanism. The alkyl mechanism's simplicity and effectiveness in explaining the PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts offer valuable insights into the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation processes.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing Ga species structures for enhanced catalytic performance, investigating the synergistic effects of multiple metal catalysts, and developing new strategies to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of PDH reactions. The understanding of the alkyl mechanism and its variations across different Ga species structures could pave the way for the development of more sustainable and efficient processes in petrochemical industries, particularly in the production of higher-value hydrocarbons from lighter alkanes.

        碳正离子机制涉及形成碳正离子中间体，然后进行一系列反应以形成所需产品。碳正离子机制与烷基机制在路径和中间体方面形成对比。不同Ga物种结构可以显著影响催化性能，例如，改变Chabazite沸石中的铝原子排列。

        计算模型支持了Ga/H-MFI催化轻烷烃脱氢的性质和作用的理解。烷基机制在丙烷脱氢反应中GaN催化剂的关键步骤包括初始丙烷活化、随后的烷基迁移和最终产物形成。活化步骤被认为是RDS，因为它对整体反应动力学有影响。烷基机制对不同的Ga物种结构进行应用，通过修改激活和产物释放的具体相互作用和途径，从而影响催化转化的效率和选择性。

        结果表明，在增加氢分压的情况下，脱氢反应受到抑制，而氢解活性达到最大值。这一最大值表明氢与丙烷竞争活性位点。在丙烷流下，未检测到二氢化镓离子，确认了丙烷在机制中的积极作用。烷基机制的简单性和有效性在解释GaN基催化剂的PDH反应中提供有价值见解，为设计更高效和选择性的催化剂用于轻烷烃脱氢过程开辟了道路。
