        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194\].

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of the CH group is identified as the RDS due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature, influencing the overall reaction kinetics. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures, modifying specific interactions and pathways in activation and product release.

        The carbenium mechanism, in contrast, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, followed by a series of reactions to form the desired products. This pathway contrasts with the alkyl mechanism's focus on alkyl radical intermediates. The rate-determining step in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts is the activation of propane and the subsequent insertion of gallium into the C-H bond, contributing significantly to the efficiency of the catalytic process. Different gallium species structures can impact the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, influencing their catalytic properties.

        The results from computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI reveal that the alkyl mechanism provides a clearer insight into the reaction dynamics, especially concerning the role of gallium in stabilizing alkyl radicals and its effect on the reaction pathway. The proposed Langmuir-Hinshelwood type mechanism suggests a series of sequential reactions, highlighting the importance of the initial activation step in determining the overall reaction kinetics.

        The results demonstrate that while dehydrogenation reactions may be inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities exhibit a maximum, indicating that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites on the catalyst. This competition highlights the dynamic interplay between reactants and the catalyst surface in determining the efficiency of the PDH reaction.

        Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to explore the synergistic effects of different gallium species structures in enhancing the catalytic properties of gallium-based catalysts. Future research could delve into optimizing the structure of gallium species to maximize the rate-determining step, thereby improving the overall catalytic performance and selectivity in PDH reactions.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook on the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts suggests avenues for innovation in catalyst design and optimization. By leveraging the insights gained from studying the alkyl mechanism, researchers can develop more efficient and selective catalysts for PDH processes, contributing to advancements in renewable energy technologies and chemical synthesis.

        相比之下，碳烯离子机制涉及形成碳烯离子中间体，然后进行一系列反应以形成所需的产品。这一路径与侧重于烷基自由基中间体的烷基机制形成对比。在丙烷脱氢反应中，镓基催化剂上的活性位点上，丙烷的激活和随后的镓插入C-H键被认为是决定性步骤，显著提高了催化过程的效率。不同的镓物种结构可能会影响方尖石型沸石中的铝原子排列，从而影响它们的催化性能。

        计算模型的成果揭示了基于镓/H-MFI催化轻烷烃脱氢的自然和角色，显示烷基机制为理解反应动态提供了清晰的视角，特别是关于镓在稳定烷基自由基及其对反应路径的影响方面的角色。提出的Langmuir-Hinshelwood类型机制表明了一系列连续反应，强调了初始激活步骤在确定整体反应动力学中的重要性。

        结果表明，在增加氢分压的情况下，脱氢反应可能受到抑制，而氢解离活动达到最大值，这表明氢与丙烷在催化剂表面的竞争。这种竞争强调了反应物与催化剂表面之间的动态相互作用在确定PDH反应效率和选择性中的作用。

        向前看，存在机会探索不同镓物种结构的协同效应，以提高镓基催化剂的催化性能。未来的研究可以专注于优化镓物种结构，以最大化决定性步骤，从而改善整体催化性能和PDH反应的选择性。

        对基于镓催化剂的丙烷脱氢反应中烷基机制的整合理解和前瞻视角提出了创新催化剂设计和优化的途径。通过利用研究烷基机制获得的见解，研究人员可以开发出更高效和选择性的催化剂，为可再生能源技术和化学合成技术的发展做出贡献。
