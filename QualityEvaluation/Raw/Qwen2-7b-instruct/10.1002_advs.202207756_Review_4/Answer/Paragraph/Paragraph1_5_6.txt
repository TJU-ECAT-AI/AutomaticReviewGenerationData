        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295], [10.1021/jacs.9b13817], and [10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism provides a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of CH groups is proposed as the RDS in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic conversion.

        The carbenium mechanism involves a different pathway for activation and product formation compared to the alkyl mechanism. The activation step is considered the RDS due to its influence on the overall reaction kinetics. The alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism in terms of pathway complexity and reaction intermediates. Different Ga species structures can influence the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, affecting the catalytic properties of the gallium-based catalysts.

        The computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI provides insights into the role of gallium species in PDH reactions. The key steps of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts include initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. The proposed carbenium mechanism follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. The activation of propane and the subsequent insertion of gallium into the C-H bond are key steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts.

        The results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum. This indicates that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites, highlighting the importance of hydrogen concentration in the reaction conditions. The specific structure of the Ga species, such as its coordination environment and surface defects, can influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggests avenues for future research. Considering the advancements and findings discussed, there is potential to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the structure of gallium species to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of PDH reactions, as well as investigating the role of hydrogen concentration in determining the rate-determining step and reaction pathways.

        The comprehensive review highlights the importance of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts, emphasizing its role in the activation of CH groups, the rate-determining step, and the applicability across different gallium species structures. Comparative studies with the carbenium mechanism provide deeper insights into the mechanisms of propane dehydrogenation catalysis.
