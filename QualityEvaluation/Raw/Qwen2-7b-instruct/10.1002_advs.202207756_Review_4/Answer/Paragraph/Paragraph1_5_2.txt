        The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts has been extensively studied, focusing on the key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process, particularly noting the activation of CH groups as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The specific structures of gallium species significantly influence the alkyl mechanism, affecting the selectivity and efficiency of catalytic conversion.

        In the alkyl mechanism, propane initially activates to form an alkyl group, followed by the insertion of a gallium atom into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl group. This process is considered the RDS due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. Different gallium species structures can alter the interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thereby impacting the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

        The carbenium mechanism, which involves the formation of a carbenium ion as an intermediate, contrasts with the alkyl mechanism in terms of activation and product formation pathways. The activation step in the alkyl mechanism is crucial for its overall reaction kinetics, highlighting the significance of the CH group activation.

        Computational modeling supports the understanding of the nature and role of gallium species in light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by gallium-based catalysts. It elucidates the key steps of the alkyl mechanism, including initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. The proposed carbenium mechanism follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation, differing significantly from the alkyl mechanism.

        The activation of propane and the subsequent insertion of gallium into the C-H bond are critical steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. Different gallium species structures can impact the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, influencing their catalytic properties.

        The results of computational modeling suggest that dihydridogallium ions formed under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures slowly decompose under inert gas flow but rapidly decompose when hydrogen is replaced by propane. This indicates that dihydridogallium ions cannot be the active site for alkane activation. However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species rapidly transforms into alkylgallium ions. This observation confirms that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

        In summary, the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps, with the activation of propane and the insertion of gallium into the C-H bond being pivotal. The rate-determining step is the activation of the CH group, which influences the overall reaction kinetics and efficiency. The carbenium mechanism contrasts with the alkyl mechanism in its activation and product formation pathways, highlighting the complexity and diversity of catalytic mechanisms in propane dehydrogenation.

        Looking ahead, there is an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research might focus on optimizing gallium species structures to enhance the catalytic performance of PDH reactions. Additionally, the integration of advanced computational techniques could provide deeper insights into the mechanism, helping to design more efficient catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements in understanding the alkyl mechanism and its application on gallium-based catalysts pave the way for future innovations in propane dehydrogenation technology. By optimizing gallium species structures and employing advanced computational methods, researchers can design catalysts with enhanced performance and selectivity. The competition between hydrogen and propane for active sites suggests new avenues for hydrogen management strategies to improve the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. Future work might also delve into the synergistic effects of multiple catalysts or the use of co-catalysts to further enhance the catalytic activity and broaden the scope of applicable feedstocks. The potential for integrating these advancements into industrial processes could lead to significant improvements in energy efficiency and sustainability in petrochemical industries.

        在以镓为基础的催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制已经进行了深入研究，主要关注从初始丙烷激活到产物形成的关键步骤。相较于卡宾离子机制，烷基机制为理解该反应过程提供了一种更为直接的方式，特别是CH基团的激活被确定为镓基催化剂上PDH反应中的速率决定步骤（RDS）。不同的镓物种结构显著影响了烷基机制的应用，从而影响催化转化的选择性和效率。

        在烷基机制中，丙烷首先激活形成烷基团，随后镓原子插入C-H键，导致形成烷基团。这一过程被认为是RDS，因为它具有较高的能量壁垒和序列特性。不同镓物种结构可以改变激活和产物释放的相互作用和路径，进而影响PDH反应的效率和选择性。

        计算模型支持了镓物种在轻烷烃脱氢由镓基催化剂催化过程中自然和角色的理解。它阐明了烷基机制的关键步骤，包括初始丙烷激活、后续烷基迁移和最终产物形成。提出的卡宾离子机制遵循了与烷基机制不同的激活和产物形成途径，突出了这两种机制之间的差异。

        碳氢化合物的激活以及随后镓插入C-H键是烷基机制中的关键步骤，对镓基催化剂上的PDH反应效率做出了重大贡献。不同镓物种结构可能会影响铝原子在查巴兹石型沸石内的排列，从而影响其催化性质。

        计算模型的结果表明，在芳香化温度下形成的二氢镓离子在惰性气体流下缓慢分解，但在氢气被丙烷替换时迅速分解。这表明二氢镓离子不能作为烷烃激活的活性位点。然而，当氢气被丙烷取代时，二氢镓物种迅速转化为烷基镓离子。这一观察证实了氢解反应活动在氢与丙烷竞争活性位点时达到最大。

        总之，PDH反应中基于镓的催化剂上的烷基机制涉及多个关键步骤，其中丙烷的激活和镓插入C-H键是至关重要的。CH基团的激活被认为是速率决定步骤，影响了整个反应动力学和效率。卡宾离子机制与烷基机制在激活和产物形成途径方面的对比，揭示了丙烷脱氢反应机制的复杂性和多样性。

        展望未来，有潜力探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来研究可能集中在优化镓物种结构以提高PDH反应性能上。此外，利用高级计算技术可以提供更深入的见解，帮助设计更高效的催化剂用于丙烷脱氢。氢与丙烷之间竞争活性位点的现象提出了新的策略，以改进脱氢过程的效率和可持续性。未来的努力也可能探索多催化剂集成或共催化剂的使用，以进一步增强催化活性并扩大适用原料范围。将这些进步整合到工业流程中有可能带来显著的能效和可持续性改善，特别是在石油化工行业中。
