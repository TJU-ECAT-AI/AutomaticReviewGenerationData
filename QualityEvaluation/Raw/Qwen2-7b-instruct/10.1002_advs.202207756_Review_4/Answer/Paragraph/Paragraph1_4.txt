        The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a simpler understanding of the reaction process.
        
        The key steps of the alkyl mechanism, from initial propane activation to product formation, have been elucidated. The activation of CH groups is proposed as the RDS in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. This process is considered the RDS due to its high energy barrier and the sequential nature of the reaction. Different Ga species structures can influence the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thereby affecting the catalytic properties.
        
        Computational modeling supports the understanding that the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts includes initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. The activation step is identified as the RDS due to its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics.
        
        The application of the alkyl mechanism to different Ga species structures highlights the importance of electronic properties in stabilizing the alkyl radical intermediate. Gallium's ability to donate electrons to the alkyl radical facilitates its reactivity towards other molecules. The specific structure of the Ga species, including its coordination environment and surface defects, can significantly influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.
        
        The results demonstrate that while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum. This maximum shows that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites, indicating a complex interplay between hydrogen and propane in the catalytic process.
        
        An integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing Ga species structures for enhanced catalytic performance, investigating the detailed mechanisms underlying the competition between hydrogen and propane, and exploring the potential of gallium-based catalysts in a broader range of alkanes dehydrogenation processes.

        来自参考文献\[10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194\]的深入分析。从参考文献\[10.1021/acscatal.7b04295\]和\[10.1021/jacs.9b13817\]中综合理解。
        碳烷脱氢（PDH）反应在镓基催化剂上的烷基机制涉及几个关键步骤：初始丙烷激活、CH组的激活作为速率决定步骤（RDS），以及不同Ga物种结构对催化转化效率和选择性的影响。与卡宾机制相比，烷基机制为反应过程提供了一个更简单的理解。
        
        从初始丙烷激活到产物形成的关键步骤已经阐明。在镓基催化剂上的PDH反应中，CH组的激活被提议作为RDS。这个过程被认为是RDS，因为它具有高的能量壁垒和反应序列的性质。不同的Ga物种结构可以影响激活和产物释放的具体相互作用和路径，从而影响催化特性。
        
        计算机建模支持了以下观点：在镓基催化剂上的PDH反应中，烷基机制包括初始丙烷激活、随后的烷基迁移和最终产物形成。这一机制与遵循不同路径的卡宾机制相对立。激活步骤被识别为RDS，因为它对整体反应动力学有显著影响。
        
        对不同Ga物种结构的应用强调了电子性质在稳定烷基自由基中间体中的重要性。镓能够向烷基自由基捐赠电子，促进其与其他分子的反应活性。Ga物种的特定结构，包括其配位环境和表面缺陷，可以显著影响反应的活性和选择性。
        
        结果表明，在增加氢分压时，脱氢反应受到抑制，而氢解反应达到最大值。这个最大值显示了氢与丙烷在活性位点的竞争，表明氢和丙烷在催化过程中存在复杂的相互作用。
        
        整合的理解和前瞻性的展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，有可能探索新兴领域和创新方法。未来研究努力可能集中在优化Ga物种结构以提高催化性能、调查氢与丙烷竞争的详细机制，并探索镓基催化剂在更广泛烷烃脱氢过程中的潜力。
