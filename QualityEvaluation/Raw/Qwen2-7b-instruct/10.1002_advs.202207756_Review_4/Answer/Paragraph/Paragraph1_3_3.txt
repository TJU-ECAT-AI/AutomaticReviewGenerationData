        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295] and [10.1021/jacs.9b13817]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts has been extensively studied, elucidating key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process, with the activation of CH groups proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The mechanism's applicability varies across different Ga species structures, influencing catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves a distinct pathway for activation and product formation, contrasting with the alkyl mechanism.

        The activation of the propane molecule and the subsequent insertion of gallium into the C-H bond are pivotal steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. Different Ga species structures can impact the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites, affecting their catalytic properties. The activation step is identified as the RDS due to its significant influence on overall reaction kinetics.

        The alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, offering a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process. The activation of CH groups is proposed as the RDS, highlighting the sequential nature of the reaction. Different Ga species structures can modify the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, influencing the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

        The results demonstrate that while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum, showing that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites. This highlights the complex interplay between hydrogen and propane in the catalytic process.

        The alkyl mechanism's application to different Ga species structures showcases the versatility and adaptability of gallium-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, offering insights into optimizing catalytic performance and enhancing product selectivity.

        The comprehensive review provides a foundational understanding of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts, comparing it to the carbenium mechanism, discussing the rate-determining step, and elucidating the role of different Ga species structures. This understanding is crucial for advancing the field of catalysis and developing more efficient and selective propane dehydrogenation processes.
