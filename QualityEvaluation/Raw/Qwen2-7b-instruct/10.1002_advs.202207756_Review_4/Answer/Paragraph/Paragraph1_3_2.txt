        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295], [10.1021/jacs.9b13817], and [10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of the CH group is proposed as the RDS in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic conversion.

        Computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI (reference [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295]) reveals that the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts consists of several key steps: initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. This mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. Among these steps, the activation process is identified as the RDS because of its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. Different Ga species structures influence the alkyl mechanism by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.

        The alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts begins with the activation of propane, followed by the insertion of a gallium atom into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl group (reference [10.1021/jacs.9b13817]). This process is considered the RDS due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature of the reaction. In contrast, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products. Activation of propane and the subsequent insertion of gallium into the C-H bond are key steps in the alkyl mechanism, contributing significantly to the efficiency of PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts.

        The specific structure of the Ga species, such as its coordination environment and surface defects, can influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction (reference [10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]). Propane adsorbs weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K, but a stronger interaction occurs above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne are observed (reference [10.1006/jcat.2000.3000]). Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane, achieving a selectivity of 50% for propylene at a conversion of 25% at 873 K.

        The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5 (reference [10.1006/jcat.2000.3000]), with the dominant reaction being the aromatization of propane. The results demonstrate that while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum. This maximum indicates that while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on refining the alkyl mechanism to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts. Innovations in the synthesis and characterization of gallium species could lead to the discovery of new catalysts with improved performance. The exploration of novel reaction conditions, such as varying temperature, pressure, and hydrogen concentration, could further optimize the PDH process. Additionally, the integration of computational methods with experimental techniques could provide deeper insights into the mechanisms governing propane dehydrogenation, paving the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable catalysts for industrial applications.

        对镓/H-MFI催化轻烷烃脱氢的性质和作用进行计算模型研究（参考文献[10.1021/acscatal.7b04295]）揭示了镓基催化剂上PDH反应中烷基机制的关键步骤包括：初始丙烷激活、随后的烷基迁移和最终产物形成。与卡本离子机制相比，烷基机制遵循不同的激活和产物形成路径。在这些步骤中，激活过程被认为是RDS，因为它对整体反应动力学有显著影响。不同Ga物种结构影响烷基机制，通过修改激活和产物释放过程中涉及的特定相互作用和路径。

        铝镓复合物在镓基催化剂上开始丙烷激活，随后将镓原子插入C-H键，导致形成烷基组（参考文献[10.1021/jacs.9b13817]）。这一过程被认为是RDS，因为它具有高能垒和反应序列的性质。相反，卡本离子机制涉及形成卡本离子中间体，然后经历一系列反应形成所需的产品。丙烷的活化及其随后向C-H键插入镓是烷基机制的关键步骤，显著提高了镓基催化剂上的PDH反应效率。

        铝镓复合物的具体结构，如其配位环境和表面缺陷，可以影响丙烷脱氢的活性和选择性（参考文献[10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]）。丙烷在支持的Mo2C下以273 K弱且可逆吸附，但300 K以上的更强相互作用伴随着吸附丙烯和丙基炔振动的观察（参考文献[10.1006/jcat.2000.3000]）。在硅酸盐上分散的Mo2C是有效的丙烷脱氢催化剂，实现了25%转化率时丙烯50%的选择性，温度为873 K。

        烷基机制在丙烷脱氢过程中的主导反应是丙烷的芳香化（参考文献[10.1006/jcat.2000.3000]）。结果表明，在增加氢分压的情况下，脱氢反应受到抑制，而氢解活性达到最大。这一最大值显示，尽管氢参与氢解反应，但它与丙烷竞争活性位点。

        整合理解和前景展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进步和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究可能专注于改进烷基机制，以提高丙烷脱氢的效率和选择性。通过合成和表征新种类的镓，可以发现性能更好的催化剂。探索不同的反应条件，如温度、压力和氢浓度的变化，可以进一步优化PDH过程。此外，计算方法与实验技术的集成可以提供对丙烷脱氢机制的更深层次的见解，从而为开发更高效和可持续的催化剂铺平道路。
