        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295] and [10.1021/jacs.9b13817]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism provides a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of CH groups is proposed as the RDS in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature of the reaction. Different Ga species structures can influence the mechanism by altering the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.

        Computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI reveals the key steps of the alkyl mechanism in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts: initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. This contrasts with the carbenium mechanism, which follows a distinct pathway for activation and product formation. The activation step is identified as the RDS due to its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release.

        The alkyl mechanism begins with the activation of propane, followed by the insertion of a gallium atom into the C-H bond, leading to the formation of an alkyl group. This process is considered the RDS due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature of the reaction. In comparison, the carbenium mechanism involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, along with the subsequent steps in the mechanism, depend significantly on the activation of the CH group. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by utilizing the electronic properties of gallium to stabilize the alkyl radical intermediate. Gallium's ability to donate electrons to the alkyl radical helps in stabilizing it and facilitating its reactivity towards other molecules. The specific structure of the Ga species, including its coordination environment and surface defects, can influence the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

        The results demonstrate that while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites. This highlights the complex interplay between hydrogen and propane in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. The alkyl mechanism offers a straightforward approach to understanding the PDH process on gallium-based catalysts, providing insights into the catalytic properties influenced by the structure of Ga species.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing the structure of gallium species for enhanced catalytic activity, investigating the role of surface defects in modulating reactivity, and developing computational models to predict the behavior of alkyl mechanisms under various conditions. These avenues could pave the way for more efficient and selective PDH processes, contributing to the advancement of green chemistry and sustainable energy solutions.

        对于镓/H-MFI催化轻烷烃脱氢的计算模型揭示了烷基机制在镓基催化剂上PDH反应的关键步骤：初始丙烷激活、随后的烷基迁移和最终产物形成。这与形成卡宾离子中间体并随后进行一系列反应以形成所需产品的卡宾机制形成对比。激活步骤被识别为RDS，因为它对整体反应动力学有显著影响。烷基机制在不同Ga物种结构上的应用通过修改激活和产物释放的具体相互作用和途径而有所不同。

        烷基机制从丙烷激活开始，随后将镓原子插入到C-H键中，形成一个烷基团。这个过程被认为是RDS，因为它具有高能量壁垒和反应序列的性质。相比之下，卡宾机制涉及到形成卡宾离子中间体，然后进行一系列反应以形成所需的产物。烷基自由基的稳定性及其后续步骤取决于CH组的激活。烷基机制通过利用镓的电子性质来稳定烷基自由基中间体，从而应用到不同Ga物种结构上。镓能够向烷基自由基捐赠电子，帮助稳定它并促进其与其他分子的反应活性。镓物种的特定结构，包括其配位环境和表面缺陷，可以影响反应性和选择性PDH反应。

        结果表明，在增加氢分压时，脱氢反应受到抑制，而当氢与丙烷竞争活性位点时，氢解离活动达到最大值。这突出了镓基催化剂上PDH反应中氢和丙烷之间复杂相互作用的性质。烷基机制提供了一种直观的方法来理解镓基催化剂上的PDH过程，提供了关于受镓物种结构影响的催化性质的见解。

        整合的理解与前景展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进步和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来的研究可能集中在优化镓物种的结构以提高催化活性、调查表面缺陷在调节活性中的作用，并开发计算模型以预测不同条件下的烷基机制行为。这些路径可以为更高效和选择性的PDH过程铺平道路，推动绿色化学和可持续能源解决方案的发展。
