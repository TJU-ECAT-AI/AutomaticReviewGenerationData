Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.7b04295], [10.1021/jacs.9b13817], and [10.1016/j.apcata.2012.05.036]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of the CH group is proposed as the RDS in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. Different Ga species structures can significantly influence the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thus affecting the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic conversion.

        The carbenium mechanism, on the other hand, involves the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, which then undergoes a series of reactions to form the desired products. The carbenium mechanism contrasts with the alkyl mechanism in terms of pathway and intermediates. Different Ga species structures can significantly influence the catalytic properties, such as the arrangement of aluminum atoms within chabazite zeolites.

        Computational modeling supports the understanding of the nature and role of Ga species in light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI. The key steps of the alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation reactions on gallium-based catalysts include initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation. The activation step is considered the RDS due to its impact on overall reaction kinetics. The alkyl mechanism applies to different Ga species structures by modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thus affecting the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic conversion.

        The results demonstrate that while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum. This maximum indicates that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected, confirming the active role of propane in the mechanism. The alkyl mechanism's simplicity and effectiveness in explaining the PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts offer valuable insights into the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation processes.

        ※※※
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing Ga species structures for enhanced catalytic performance, investigating the synergistic effects of multiple metal catalysts, and developing new strategies to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of PDH reactions. The understanding of the alkyl mechanism and its variations across different Ga species structures could pave the way for the development of more sustainable and efficient processes in petrochemical industries, particularly in the production of higher-value hydrocarbons from lighter alkanes.
