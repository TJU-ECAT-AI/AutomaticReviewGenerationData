        The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts has been extensively studied, offering a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process compared to the carbenium mechanism. The key steps involve initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures influencing catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. The activation of the CH group is pivotal, serving as the RDS due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. The alkyl mechanism contrasts with the carbenium mechanism in pathway specifics, with the former involving the formation of an alkyl group from propane activation, followed by its migration and reaction to form products like propylene, ethylene, and methane. Different Ga species structures can alter the interactions and pathways, impacting the reactivity and selectivity of the PDH reaction.

        The specific structure of gallium species, including its coordination environment and surface defects, plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic conversion. Computational models have provided insights into the nature and role of gallium species in light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI. These models have elucidated that the key steps include initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation, contrasting with the carbenium mechanism which involves a distinct pathway for activation and product formation.

        The activation step is identified as the RDS in the alkyl mechanism, crucial for the overall reaction kinetics. This highlights the importance of the activation process in determining the efficiency of the PDH reaction. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, along with subsequent steps in the mechanism, are significantly influenced by the activation of the CH group. The alkyl mechanism applies differently across various Ga species structures, modifying the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thus affecting catalytic properties.

        The results from computational modeling suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by alternative reactions, and dihydridogallium ions formed under hydrogen slowly decompose under inert gas flow but rapidly decompose upon hydrogen replacement by propane. These findings underscore the complex dynamics of the PDH reaction mechanisms and the role of gallium species in catalysis.

        In summary, the alkyl mechanism provides a simplified yet comprehensive understanding of propane dehydrogenation on gallium-based catalysts, emphasizing the pivotal role of the CH activation step as the RDS and the influence of gallium species structures on catalytic performance. The insights from computational modeling further enrich our understanding of the reaction pathways and the mechanisms underlying the PDH process.
