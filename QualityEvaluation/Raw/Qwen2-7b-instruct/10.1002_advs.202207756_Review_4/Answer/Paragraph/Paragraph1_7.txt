        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2020.110194\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/acscatal.7b04295\], \[10.1021/jacs.9b13817\], and \[10.1006/jcat.2000.3000\]. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps: initial propane activation, activation of CH groups considered the rate-determining step (RDS), and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a simpler understanding of the reaction process. The activation of the CH group is identified as the RDS due to its high energy barrier and sequential nature. Different Ga species structures can modify the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, impacting the catalytic properties.

        The carbenium mechanism, involving the formation of a carbenium ion intermediate, contrasts with the alkyl mechanism. Among these steps, the activation process is the RDS, significantly influencing the overall reaction kinetics. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, along with subsequent steps in the mechanism, rely heavily on the activation of the CH group. The alkyl mechanism's application to different Ga species structures utilizes the electronic properties of gallium to stabilize the alkyl radical intermediate, with gallium's electron donation capability aiding in alkyl radical stabilization and reactivity towards other molecules. The specific structure of the Ga species, including its coordination environment and surface defects, influences reactivity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

        The decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate, as observed in reactions (17) and (18), is suggested instead of reaction (19). Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions were never detected, indicating they cannot be the active sites for alkane activation. When hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species rapidly transforms into alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected, confirming that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites. The results demonstrate that increasing hydrogen partial pressure inhibits dehydrogenation reactions, while hydrogenolysis activities peak, showing hydrogen's competitive role in PDH reactions.

        The reaction pathway of propane involves the initial activation, followed by cleavage of the C-H bonds to form alkyl radicals, which react with oxygen or other reactants to produce products like propylene, ethylene, and methane. The carbenium mechanism's formation of a carbenium ion intermediate is often observed in reactions where the formation of a positively charged carbon center is energetically favorable. The specific structure of Ga species, such as its coordination environment and surface defects, can influence reactivity and selectivity in PDH reactions.

        Computational modeling of the nature and role of Ga species for light alkane dehydrogenation catalyzed by Ga/H-MFI highlights the importance of the alkyl mechanism in understanding the reaction process. The key steps include initial propane activation, subsequent alkyl migration, and final product formation, contrasting with the distinct pathway followed by the carbenium mechanism. The activation step is considered the RDS due to its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. The alkyl mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures is influenced by the specific interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity.

        An integrative understanding and prospective outlook based on the content divulged in the file suggests an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on optimizing Ga species structures to enhance catalytic efficiency and selectivity in PDH reactions, leveraging the insights provided by the alkyl mechanism. There is a need to investigate how different Ga species configurations can optimize the electronic properties for better alkyl radical stabilization and reactivity, potentially leading to enhanced performance in PDH catalysis. Additionally, the role of hydrogen in competing with propane for active sites could be further explored to develop strategies for maximizing propylene yield and minimizing byproduct formation.

        碳烯机制通过形成碳烯离子中间体，与烷基机制形成对比。在这些步骤中，激活过程被确定为RDS，因为它具有较高的能量壁垒和顺序性质，显著影响总体反应动力学。不同的Ga物种结构可以修改激活和产物释放过程中涉及的具体相互作用和路径，从而影响催化特性。

        研究表明，增加氢分压抑制脱氢反应，而氢解活性达到最大值时，氢与丙烷竞争活性位点。结果表明，在丙烷流动下，未检测到二氢镓离子，这表明它们无法作为烷烃激活的活性位点。当氢被丙烷替换时，二氢物种迅速转化为烷基镓离子。在丙烷流动下，未检测到二氢镓离子，证实了氢解活性达到峰值时氢与丙烷竞争活性位点的现象。这一发现表明，需要优化Ga物种结构以提高PDH反应的催化效率和选择性，并利用烷基机制提供的见解。
