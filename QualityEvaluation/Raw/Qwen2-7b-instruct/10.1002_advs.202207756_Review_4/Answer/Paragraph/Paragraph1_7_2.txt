        The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts has been extensively studied, focusing on the key steps from initial propane activation to product formation. This mechanism is distinguished by the activation of CH groups, which is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts. Compared to the carbenium mechanism, the alkyl mechanism offers a more straightforward understanding of the reaction process. The stability and reactivity of the alkyl radical, along with subsequent steps in the mechanism, heavily rely on the activation of the CH group. The alkyl mechanism applies differently to various Ga species structures, influencing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic conversion.

        Computational modeling has elucidated that the key steps of the alkyl mechanism involve initial propane activation, followed by the activation of CH groups considered the RDS, and the mechanism's applicability to different Ga species structures affecting catalytic conversion efficiency and selectivity. The proposed carbenium mechanism involves a distinct pathway for activation and product formation, contrasting with the alkyl mechanism.

        The activation step is identified as the RDS due to its significant impact on the overall reaction kinetics. Different Ga species structures can modify the interactions and pathways involved in activation and product release, thereby influencing the efficiency and selectivity of the PDH reaction. This highlights the importance of the electronic properties of gallium in stabilizing the alkyl radical intermediate.

        The results from computational studies suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions that differ from the typical pathway. This implies that the proposed mechanism might need adjustments to accurately reflect the observed behavior. The dihydridogallium cations were never detected under propane flow, suggesting they are not the active sites for alkane activation, but they rapidly transform into alkylgallium ions when hydrogen is replaced by propane. This confirms that hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

        Propane adsorbs weakly and reversibly on supported Mo2C below 273 K, with a stronger interaction occurring above 300 K, when vibrations of adsorbed propylene and propylidyne are observed. Mo2C dispersed on silica is an effective dehydrogenating catalyst for propane, with the highest selectivity to propylene being 50% at a conversion of 25% at 873 K. The reaction pathway of propane is completely different over Mo2C/ZSM-5, with the dominant reaction being the aromatization of propane.

        The alkyl mechanism provides a clearer understanding of the reaction process compared to the carbenium mechanism, offering insights into the role of the CH group activation as the rate-determining step. Different Ga species structures can significantly influence the catalytic properties, highlighting the complexity and variability in PDH reactions on gallium-based catalysts.

        The findings from these studies open up avenues for future research in optimizing catalyst design and improving the efficiency of PDH reactions. The detailed understanding of the alkyl mechanism could lead to the development of new catalysts with enhanced selectivity and activity, potentially revolutionizing the propane dehydrogenation industry.

        在镓基催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的烷基机制已经进行了广泛研究，重点在于从初始丙烷活化到产物形成的关键步骤。该机制以CH组的激活作为PDH反应中镓基催化剂的速率决定性步骤（RDS）而著称。相较于碳烯离子机制，烷基机制提供了更易于理解的反应过程。烷基自由基的稳定性及其后续步骤在很大程度上依赖于CH组的活化。不同镓物种结构的应用影响着催化转化的效率和选择性。

        计算模型揭示了烷基机制的关键步骤包括初始丙烷活化，随后是考虑为RDS的CH组激活，以及机制在不同镓物种结构下的应用对催化转化效率和选择性的影响。所提出的碳烯离子机制涉及活性和产物形成的独特路径，与烷基机制形成对比。

        活化步骤被确认为RDS，因为它对整体反应动力学有显著影响。不同的镓物种结构可以修改激活和产品释放的相互作用和途径，从而影响PDH反应的效率和选择性。这强调了镓的电子性质在稳定烷基自由基中间体中的重要性。

        研究结果表明，烷基氢化产物的分解通过不同于典型路径的反应发生。这意味着可能需要调整提议的机制以准确反映观察到的行为。在用丙烷代替氢气时，从未检测到的二氢镓离子迅速转化为烷基镓离子。这证实了当氢与丙烷竞争活性位点时，氢化裂解活动达到最大值。

        在273 K以下，支持的Mo2C上的丙烷吸附弱且可逆，而在300 K以上，当吸附的丙烯和丙基二烯振动时会出现更强的相互作用。分散在二氧化硅上的Mo2C是丙烷脱氢的有效催化剂，丙烯的选择性最高可达50%，在873 K时转化率为25%。在Mo2C/ZSM-5上，丙烷的反应路径完全不同，主导反应是丙烷的芳构化。

        烷基机制提供了与碳烯离子机制相比更清晰的理解，揭示了作为RDS的CH组活化的作用。不同镓物种结构的显著影响揭示了镓基催化剂上PDH反应的复杂性和多样性。

        这些研究的结果为未来的研究开辟了新的方向，旨在优化催化剂设计并提高PDH反应的效率。对于烷基机制及其在不同镓物种结构中的应用的详细理解为这些未来方向奠定了坚实的基础，为丙烷脱氢催化领域的突破提供了前景。
