[1] "Our results suggest that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead."
[2] "A sequence of steps that corresponds essentially to reaction (19) has been analyzed by Frash and van Santen [24] in their theoretical study of ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, with dihydridogallium ions as the active sites."
[3] "Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction, possibly by reversal of reactions such as (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatisation."
[4] "A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility: ZOGa+(CH3)(C2H5) + ZOGaH2 + 2ZOGa+ + C2H6 + CH4."

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts suggests that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs through reactions (17) and (18) rather than the sequence analyzed by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, where dihydridogallium ions act as active sites.

2. Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium inhibits the aromatization reaction by possibly reversing reactions like (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization.

3. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, represented by reaction (20), is considered a likely possibility for the process, involving the activation of gallium species (ZOGa+) with alkyl groups (CH3)(C2H5) and hydride (ZOGaH2) to produce methane (CH4) and hexane (C2H6).

1. 在使用镓基催化剂的丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，烷基机制表明，烷基氢化产物的分解通过反应（17）和（18）发生，而不是弗拉什和范桑特在他们的理论研究中分析的乙烷激活过程中的镓交换沸石，其中二氢镓离子作为活性位点。

2. 向反应介质中添加氢气可能通过逆转反应（17）和其他涉及芳构化的脱氢步骤来抑制芳香化反应。

3. 可能的一种机制是兰格缪尔-希恩伍德类型机制，表示为反应（20），涉及激活的镓物种（ZOGa+）与烷基团（CH3）（C2H5）和氢化物（ZOGaH2）的激活，以产生甲烷（CH4）和己烷（C2H6）。
