1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the formation of isolated Ga(I) species from binuclear oxidic gallium clusters. This process leads to the production of Lewis acid sites from Brnsted acid sites in a 1:1 ratio, accompanied by de-alumination of the zeolite framework.

2. The alkyl mechanism suggests that when hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed upon replacing hydrogen with inert gas. However, when propane replaces hydrogen, the formation of isolated Ga(I) species becomes irreversible due to stabilization by alkyl groups bonded to gallium.

3. Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but these ions were slowly decomposed upon replacing hydrogen with inert gas. This slow decomposition indicates that dihydridogallium ions cannot intermediate hydrogen desorption during the aromatization reaction.

4. When hydrogen is replaced by propane, dihydrido species are rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected.

5. The alkyl mechanism confirms that dihydridogallium species cannot be the active site for alkane activation in this system, as proposed by some investigators.

6. The influence of hydrogen on catalyst activity and selectivity is significant, with hydrogenolysis activities reaching a maximum when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

7. Our results demonstrate that increasing hydrogen partial pressure inhibits dehydrogenation reactions, while hydrogenolysis activities peak when hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.

1. 烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中，通过形成二核氧化镓簇中的孤立Ga(I)物种涉及。这一过程导致从酸性位点产生Lewis酸，在1:1比例下生成Lewis酸，同时伴有沸石框架的脱铝，产生额外的铝氧物种，这也有助于解释酸性位点的减少和Lewis酸性的增加。

2. 该烷基机制表明，当氢气作为还原剂时，将氢气替换为惰性气体可以部分逆转二核氧化镓簇的分解。然而，当丙烷替换氢气时，孤立Ga(I)物种的形成变得不可逆，因为它们被连接到镓上的烷基稳定。

3. 在氢气还原后观察到二氢镓离子，但这些离子在将氢气替换为惰性气体后缓慢分解。这种慢分解表明二氢镓离子不能在脱氢化反应期间介导氢解离。

4. 当氢气被丙烷替换时，二氢物种迅速被烷基镓离子取代。在丙烷流动下，未检测到二氢镓阳离子。

5. 烷基机制确认，二氢镓物种无法成为此系统中烷烃激活的活性位点，如某些调查者所提议的。

6. 氢气对催化剂活性和选择性的影响显著，当氢参与氢解离反应并与丙烷竞争活性位点时，氢解离活动达到最大值。

7. 我们的结果表明，提高氢气分压抑制脱氢反应，而氢解离活动在氢与丙烷竞争活性位点时达到峰值。

1. The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts suggests that the decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs through reactions (17) and (18) rather than the sequence analyzed by Frash and van Santen for ethane activation on gallium-exchanged zeolites, where dihydridogallium ions act as active sites.

2. Addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium inhibits the aromatization reaction by possibly reversing reactions like (17) and other dehydrogenation steps involved in aromatization.

3. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, represented by reaction (20), is considered a likely possibility for the process, involving the activation of gallium species (ZOGa+) with alkyl groups (CH3)(C2H5) and hydride (ZOGaH2) to produce methane (CH4) and hexane (C2H6).

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane activates the catalyst surface, forming an alkyl group bonded to gallium. This alkyl group then undergoes dehydrogenation, releasing hydrogen and forming an alkene. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which proposes the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The alkyl mechanism suggests that the activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS), as the addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction by reversing dehydrogenation steps. This highlights the importance of hydrogen in the PDH process. Increasing hydrogen partial pressure inhibits dehydrogenation reactions, while promoting hydrogenolysis activities, indicating a competition between hydrogen and propane for the active sites on the catalyst. The formation of alkyl groups bonded to gallium stabilizes the reduced gallium species, suggesting that alkylgallium ions play a crucial role in the PDH process, rather than dihydridogallium ions.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂中涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷激活催化剂表面，形成与镓相连的烷基团。然后，该烷基团进行脱氢，释放氢并形成烯烃。该机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者提出了形成碳正离子中间体的概念。烷基机制认为激活步骤是决定性步骤（RDS），因为向反应介质中添加氢会通过反转脱氢步骤抑制异构化反应。这突出了氢在PDH过程中的重要性。增加氢分压抑制脱氢反应，同时促进氢解离活性，表明氢和丙烷之间在催化剂上的活性位点存在竞争。形成与镓相连的烷基团稳定了还原镓物种，表明烷基镓离子在PDH过程中起着关键作用，而不是二氢镓离子。
