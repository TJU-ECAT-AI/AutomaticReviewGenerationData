1. Dihydridogallium ions, formed under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures, decompose slowly under inert gas flow and rapidly when hydrogen is replaced by propane.
2. Dihydridogallium ions are not the active sites for alkane activation. Hydrogen competes with propane for these active sites in hydrogenolysis reactions.
3. A possible reaction scheme for catalyst activation and the first steps in the aromatization reaction is suggested.
4. Propane pulse experiments showed an increase in propane conversion with the number of pulses at aromatization temperatures.
5. Dihydridogallium ions are not the active sites for alkane activation. Hydrogen competes with propane for these active sites in hydrogenolysis reactions.
6. When hydrogen is replaced by inert gas, the decomposition of binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed. However, when propane is the reducing agent, the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible.
7. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations are not detected.
8. These findings confirm that dihydridogallium ions cannot be the active sites for alkane activation.
9. Gas phase hydrogen at the start of the reaction significantly affects catalyst activity and selectivity.
10. Increasing hydrogen partial pressure inhibits dehydrogenation reactions, while hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum. This shows that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites.
11. The observed pattern of behavior confirms that dihydridogallium species are not the active species in this system.
