[7] "However, when hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species appear to be rapidly replaced by alkylgallium ions."
[8] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions were never detected."
[9] "The results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum."
[10] "This maximum shows that, while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites."

1. Dihydridogallium ions formed under hydrogen at aromatization temperatures decompose slowly under inert gas flow and rapidly when hydrogen is replaced by propane.
2. The formation of dihydridogallium species is represented by reaction (14): ZGa+ + H2 → ZGaH2 +.
3. The decomposition of the alkylhydrido intermediate occurs by reactions (17) and (18) instead of reaction (19).
4. A Langmuir-Hinshelwood type of mechanism, such as represented by reaction (20), is a likely possibility for the activation of the catalysts at the beginning of the reaction and for propane activation.
5. Dihydridogallium cations were never detected under propane flow.
6. Our results suggest that dihydridogallium ions cannot be the active site for alkane activation.
7. When hydrogen is replaced by propane, the dihydrido species rapidly transforms into alkylgallium ions.
8. Under propane flow, dihydridogallium ions are not detected.
9. Increasing hydrogen partial pressure inhibits dehydrogenation reactions, while hydrogenolysis activities reach a maximum.
10. This demonstrates that hydrogen competes with propane for the active sites during the reaction.
