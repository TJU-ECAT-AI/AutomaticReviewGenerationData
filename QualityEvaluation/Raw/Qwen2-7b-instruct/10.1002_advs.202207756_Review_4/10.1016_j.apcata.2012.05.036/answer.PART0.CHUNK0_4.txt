[1] "Dihydridogallium ions were observed after reduction in hydrogen, but were slowly decomposed when hydrogen flow was replaced by inert gas."
[2] "When hydrogen is the reducing agent, the decomposition of the binuclear oxidic species is partially reversed when hydrogen is replaced by inert gas, but when the reducing agent is propane the formation of isolated Ga(I) species is irreversible, probably because it is stabilized by alkyl groups bonded to gallium, that were seen to be formed and to be stable when propane flow is replaced by inert gas."
[3] "Under propane flow, dihydridogallium cations were never detected."
[4] "These facts show that it cannot be the active site for alkane activation, as proposed by some investigators."
[5] "It was also shown that gas phase hydrogen added at the beginning of the reaction has a strong influence on catalysts activity and selectivity."
[6] "Our results demonstrate that, while dehydrogenation reactions are inhibited by increasing hydrogen partial pressure, hydrogenolysis activities go through a maximum."
[7] "This maximum shows that, while hydrogen takes part in hydrogenolysis reactions, it competes with propane for the active sites."
[8] "This pattern of behavior confirms that dihydridogallium species cannot be the active species in this system."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves several key steps. Initially, propane activates the catalyst surface, forming an alkyl group bonded to gallium. This alkyl group then undergoes dehydrogenation, releasing hydrogen and forming an alkene. The mechanism differs from the carbenium mechanism, which proposes the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The alkyl mechanism suggests that the activation step is the rate-determining step (RDS), as the addition of hydrogen to the reaction medium suppresses the aromatization reaction by reversing dehydrogenation steps. This highlights the importance of hydrogen in the PDH process. Increasing hydrogen partial pressure inhibits dehydrogenation reactions, while promoting hydrogenolysis activities, indicating a competition between hydrogen and propane for the active sites on the catalyst. The formation of alkyl groups bonded to gallium stabilizes the reduced gallium species, suggesting that alkylgallium ions play a crucial role in the PDH process, rather than dihydridogallium ions.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中的镓基催化剂中涉及几个关键步骤。最初，丙烷激活催化剂表面，形成与镓相连的烷基团。然后，该烷基团进行脱氢，释放氢并形成烯烃。该机制与碳正离子机制不同，后者提出了形成碳正离子中间体的概念。烷基机制认为激活步骤是决定性步骤（RDS），因为向反应介质中添加氢会通过反转脱氢步骤抑制异构化反应。这突出了氢在PDH过程中的重要性。增加氢分压抑制脱氢反应，同时促进氢解离活性，表明氢和丙烷之间在催化剂上的活性位点存在竞争。形成与镓相连的烷基团稳定了还原镓物种，表明烷基镓离子在PDH过程中起着关键作用，而不是二氢镓离子。
