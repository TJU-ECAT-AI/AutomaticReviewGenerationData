[1] "In the present study, we considered three possible types of charge-compensating gallium species in reduced Ga/ZSM-5: Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2."
[2] "At the initial step of ethane activation, all of the gallium species considered act as Lewis acids promoting heterolytic CH cleavage involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."
[3] "The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species is the most favorable process."
[4] "The overall activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+Zsites is equal to 233 kJ/mol."
[5] "Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido-gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regeneration of GaH2+ sites."
[6] "Bivalent GaH+2 species stabilized at the cation site with distant framework Al sites exhibit significantly higher initial activity for ethane activation but much lower stability compared with Ga+ sites."
[7] "On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically."

1. Three types of gallium species were considered: Ga+, GaH2+, and GaH+2, in the study of reduced Ga/ZSM-5. 

2. All gallium species act as Lewis acids to promote heterolytic CH bond cleavage at the initial step of ethane activation.

3. The catalytic cycle ends with the simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4, making it the most favorable process.

4. The activation barrier for C2H6 dehydrogenation over Ga+ sites is 233 kJ/mol.

5. Hydrogenated gallium species are less likely to be active sites, with their dihydrido forms decomposing more easily than regenerating.

6. GaH+2 species with distant Al sites have higher initial ethane activation activity but lower stability compared to Ga+ sites.

7. GaH+2 species with close Al sites are the most stable but have a weakly favored initial CH bond activation.

1. 研究中考虑了三种镓物种：Ga+、GaH2+和GaH+2，它们在减少的Ga/ZSM-5中。

2. 所有的镓物种都作为路易斯酸来促进乙烷激活时的异裂CH键。

3. 催化循环以同时释放H2和C2H4为最有利的过程结束。

4. Ga+位点上C2H6脱氢的活化能是233 kJ/mol。

5. 含有氢的镓物种不太可能是活性位点，其二氢形式比再生更容易分解。

6. 具有远距离Al位点的GaH+2物种在初始乙烷激活阶段具有更高的活性，但稳定性较低与Ga+位点相比。

7. 邻近Al位点的GaH+2物种是最稳定的，但初始CH键激活的倾向较弱。
