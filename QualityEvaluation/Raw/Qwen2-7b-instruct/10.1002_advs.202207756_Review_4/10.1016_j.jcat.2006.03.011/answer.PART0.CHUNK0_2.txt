[1] "Decomposition of GaH2+ leading to formation of Ga+ during the catalytic cycle is more favorable than regeneration of these sites."
[2] "The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process."
[3] "The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."
[4] "Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites. Decomposition of the dihydrido- gallyl ions, resulting in formation of univalent gallium ions during the catalytic cycle, is significantly favored over regen- eration of GaH2+ sites."
[5] "On the other hand, GaH+2 ions charge-compensating two proximate framework aluminum ions are the most stable cationic species; however, initial activation of the CH bond over these sites is strongly disfavored both thermodynamically and kinetically."

The alkyl mechanism in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions on gallium-based catalysts involves the heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond by the gallium ion (Ga+) and a basic oxygen atom from the zeolite framework. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Initial Activation**: Propane molecules interact with the gallium ion, which acts as a Lewis acid, promoting the heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond. This results in the formation of a neutral GaC2H5 species and a Brnsted acid site.

2. **Product Rearrangement**: The neutral GaC2H5 species readily rearranges to form a positively charged [HGaC2H5]+ species, which is more stable.

3. **Decomposition**: The [HGaC2H5]+ species decomposes through the simultaneous desorption of hydrogen (H2) and propane (C2H4), regenerating the gallium ion. This step is the most favorable process in the catalytic cycle.

The carbenium mechanism is proposed as the rate-determining step (RDS) because it involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which is a more energetically demanding process compared to the alkyl mechanism. The alkyl mechanism is favored because it requires less energy to form a stable [HGaC2H5]+ species, which can efficiently decompose to regenerate the gallium ion.

Regarding different Ga species structures, univalent Ga+ ions are the most probable active species for PDH reactions in high-silica zeolites. They exhibit a lower apparent activation barrier of 233 kJ/mol. Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+ and GaH+2) are less likely to serve as active sites, as their decomposition to form univalent gallium ions is favored over their regeneration. Bivalent GaH+2 species are more stable but have a lower initial activity for ethane activation due to the strong disfavoring of the initial activation step.

烷基机制在丙烷脱氢（PDH）反应中涉及镓基催化剂上的镓离子（Ga+）和沸石框架中的基本氧原子促进的CH键异裂。关键步骤如下：

1. **初始激活**：丙烷分子与镓离子（作为路易斯酸）相互作用，促进CH键的异裂。这导致形成一个中性GaC2H5物种和一个Brnsted酸位点。

2. **产物重排**：中性GaC2H5物种很容易重排形成一个正电荷的[HGaC2H5]+物种，该物种更稳定。

3. **分解**：[HGaC2H5]+物种通过同时释放氢（H2）和丙烷（C2H4），再生镓离子进行分解。这是催化循环中最有利的过程。

碳正离子机制被提议为速率决定步骤（RDS），因为它涉及到形成一个碳正离子中间体，这是一个比烷基机制更耗能的过程。烷基机制是首选的，因为它只需要较少的能量来形成稳定的[HGaC2H5]+物种，该物种可以有效地分解以再生镓离子。

关于不同的Ga物种结构，单价Ga+离子是高硅沸石中PDH反应最可能的活性物种。它们表现出较低的显热活化能屏障，为233 kJ/mol。氢化镓物种（GaH2+和GaH+2）不太可能作为活性位点，因为它们分解形成单价镓离子的趋势大于它们的再生。二价GaH+2物种更稳定，但在乙烷激活方面具有较低的初始活性，因为初始激活步骤受到强烈的热力学和动力学抑制。
