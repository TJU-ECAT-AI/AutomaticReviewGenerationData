[1] "Decomposition of GaH2+ leading to formation of Ga+ during the catalytic cycle is more favorable than regeneration of these sites."
[2] "The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process."
[3] "The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."
[4] "Hydrogenated gallium species (GaH2+Zand ZGaH+2Z) are less likely active sites."
[5] "However, initial heterolytic cleav- age of the CH bond results in formation of [HGaC2H5]+ ions that preferentially follow the reaction path, again leading to univalent gallium cations."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Decomposing GaH2+ into Ga+ during the catalytic cycle is favored over regenerating the sites.
2. The cycle ends with a single-step breakdown of [HGaC2H5]+Z, where desorbing H2 and C2H4 simultaneously is the preferred process.
3. The estimated activation barrier for this process within the model is 233 kJ/mol.
4. Hydrogenated gallium species like GaH2+ are less likely to function as active sites.
5. After the initial heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond, [HGaC2H5]+ ions tend to follow the reaction path, eventually leading to univalent gallium cations.

1. 在催化循环中，分解GaH2+形成Ga+比再生这些站点更为有利。
2. 循环通过一步分解[HGaC2H5]+Z结束，同时脱除H2和C2H4是更优选的过程。
3. 模型内估计的此过程激活壁垒为233 kJ/mol。
4. 含氢镓物种如GaH2+不太可能作为活性位点。
5. 在初始异裂CH键后，[HGaC2H5]+离子倾向于遵循反应路径，最终导致单正电荷镓原子。
