[1] "The role of the active site is limited to stabilize the products of the homolytic dissociation of ethane via chemisorption of C2H5 and H radicals."
[2] "The catalytic cycle is closed by one-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. It was found that simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 from these species [reaction (5)] is the most favorable process."
[3] "It is also noticeable that the GaH+2 species are isolobal to Zn+2 ions."
[4] "The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."

1. The role of the active site is to stabilize the products of the homolytic dissociation of ethane through chemisorption of C2H5 and H radicals. 
2. The catalytic cycle concludes with a single-step decomposition of [HGaC2H5]+Z. Among the processes, simultaneous desorption of H2 and C2H4 is the most favorable.
3. GaH+2 species share similarities with Zn+2 ions in terms of geometry, charge properties, and chemical behavior.
4. The estimated activation barrier for ethane dehydrogenation over Ga+ sites is 233 kJ/mol.

1. 活性位点的作用是通过将C2H5和H自由基化学吸附来稳定乙烷的异裂产物。
2. 催化循环以[HGaC2H5]+Z物种的一步分解结束。同时脱出H2和C2H4的过程是最有利的。
3. GaH+2物种与Zn+2离子在几何结构、电荷性质和化学行为上具有相似性。
4. 在所使用的模型中估计，乙烷脱氢反应的活化能为233 kJ/mol。
