[1] "Decomposition of GaH2+ leading to formation of Ga+ during the catalytic cycle is more favorable than regeneration of these sites."
[2] "The initial step of CH activation is the oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, which proceeds via an indirect heterolytic mechanism involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."
[3] "The role of the active site is limited to stabilize the products of the homolytic dissociation of ethane via chemisorption of C2H5 and H radicals."
[4] "It was found that at the initial step of ethane activation, all of the gallium species considered act as Lewis acids promoting heterolytic CH cleavage involving the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice."
[5] "The apparent activation barrier for this process estimated within the model used is equal to 233 kJ/mol."

1. The decomposition of GaH2+ into Ga+ is favored over regeneration during the catalytic cycle. 
2. The activation of the CH bond involves an oxidative addition of an alkane molecule to the Ga+ cation, facilitated by the basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite lattice. 
3. The role of the Ga+ cation in the reaction mechanism is to stabilize the products of the homolytic dissociation of ethane via chemisorption of C2H5 and H radicals.
4. At the initial step of ethane activation, all gallium species function as Lewis acids, promoting heterolytic cleavage of the CH bond.
5. The estimated activation barrier for the ethane dehydrogenation reaction over Ga+ sites is 233 kJ/mol.
