[1] "In the past two decades, there has been a strong interest to study the ODH of light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane), rather than the direct dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, because of the potential commercial interest to utilize alkanes effectively."
[2] "In fact, the dehydrogenation of paraffins (eq 24) to give the corresponding olefins and H2 is a strongly endothermic process that must be performed at temperatures >600 C. At the high reaction temperatures, other unwanted reactions that lead to coke also occur, and the catalyst requires frequent regeneration."
[3] "However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."
[4] "In the past twenty years, many papers have been published on the development of catalyst systems for the ODH of alkanes using oxygen, and their results can be found in several reviews."
[5] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources."
[6] "A notable example of the utilization of alkanes is their conversion to unsaturated hydrocarbons, because the present-day chemical industry is heavily dependent on the use of olefins as starting materials."
[7] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[8] "It is shown that the use of CO2 instead of oxygen provides an effective method of CO2 utilization in selective oxidation."

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and frequent catalyst regeneration required due to the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation process. The use of oxygen leads to over-oxidation, reducing selectivity towards olefins.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient method to produce propylene. It allows the utilization of alkanes effectively, reduces the need for catalyst regeneration, and avoids over-oxidation.

3. One advantage of ODHP is its ability to utilize low-valued natural gas containing CO2 without emitting CO2, thanks to the simultaneous transformation of methane and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels.

4. ODHP presents its own set of advantages by enabling CO2 utilization in selective oxidation. This makes it an attractive alternative to traditional methods that rely on oxygen.

5. The limitations of ODHP include the exothermic characteristics of the reactions in the presence of CO2, which necessitates heat removal to prevent over-oxidation. Additionally, the effectiveness of the process depends on the development of efficient catalysts that can maintain high selectivity and stability over time.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢过程的高能耗以及催化剂需要频繁再生，这主要是由于烷烃脱氢反应的吸热性质。使用氧气会导致过氧化，降低烯烃的选择性。

2. 烷基氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种更可能节能的方法来生产丙烯，从而解决了这些挑战。它使烷烃的有效利用成为可能，减少了催化剂再生的需求，并避免了过氧化。

3. ODHP的一个优势是能够利用含有二氧化碳的低价值天然气，而无需排放二氧化碳，通过同时将甲烷和其他较低烷烃转化为有价值的化学品或燃料。

4. ODHP通过使二氧化碳在选择性氧化中得到利用，提供了一种有吸引力的替代传统依赖氧气的方法。

5. ODHP的局限性包括在二氧化碳存在的条件下反应的放热特性，这需要移除热量以防止过氧化。此外，该过程的效果取决于开发高效催化剂的能力，这些催化剂可以保持高选择性和稳定性随时间。
