[1] "In the past two decades, there has been a strong interest to study the ODH of light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane), rather than the direct dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, because of the potential commercial interest to utilize alkanes effectively."
[2] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature."
[3] "However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."
[4] "In the past two decades, many papers have been published on the development of catalyst systems for the ODH of alkanes using oxygen, and their results can be found in several reviews."
[5] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest."
[6] "The inevitable formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 from the reactant (CH4) and products (C2H4 and C2H6) (reactions 35), however, seems to be one of the most serious problems, from a practical point of view."

[10] "In the presence of CO2, these oxides may be converted to the corresponding carbonates, which may subsequently be transformed partly to SrMnO2.5 and BaMnO2.5."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy consumption due to the high temperatures required for direct dehydrogenation, and the risk of over-oxidation leading to the formation of carbon oxides, which reduces the selectivity towards olefins. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, which reduces energy consumption, and by using CO2 as an oxidant instead of oxygen, which helps suppress over-oxidation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Advantages include the potential for energy savings, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and the ability to use less-reactive propane as a feedstock. Limitations include the requirement for efficient catalysts to ensure high selectivity and activity, the potential for coke formation which can deplete catalyst activity over time, and the complexity in optimizing reaction conditions for maximum yield and selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括直接脱氢所需的高能耗，以及氧化过度导致碳氧化物形成的风险，这会降低烯烃的选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过在较低温度下运行解决了这些问题，从而降低了能耗，并且通过使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂而不是氧气，有助于抑制氧化过度。然而，ODHP也存在优势和局限性。优势包括潜在的节能、减少环境影响，由于低温操作而排放较少，以及能够使用反应性较低的丙烷作为原料。局限性包括需要高效的催化剂以确保高选择性和活性，焦炭形成可能导致催化剂活性随着时间的推移而下降，以及优化反应条件以实现最大产率和选择性的复杂性。
