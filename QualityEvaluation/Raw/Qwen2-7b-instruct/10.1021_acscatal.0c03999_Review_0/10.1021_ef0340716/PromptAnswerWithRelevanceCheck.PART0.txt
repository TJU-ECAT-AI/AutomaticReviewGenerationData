[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes by CO2 to olefins is a promising alternative to dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by oxygen, which suffer from either coking problems or over-oxidation."
[2] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature."
[3] "However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."
[4] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[5] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant for the partial oxidation of lower alkanes may become an important route for the utilization of natural gas."
[6] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources."
[7] "These reactions include CH4 coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."
[8] "It is shown that the use of CO2 instead of oxygen provides an effective method of CO2 utilization in selective oxidation."

Propylene production faces challenges related to coking problems and over-oxidation in traditional dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes utilizing oxygen. CO2 offers an alternative as a mild oxidant, providing benefits such as preventing coking and avoiding over-oxidation. Its use in partial oxidation of lower alkanes and as a mild oxidant for selective oxidation processes demonstrates its effectiveness in overcoming some of the drawbacks of conventional propylene production methods. CO2 can be efficiently utilized to transform natural gas, including methane and other lower alkanes, into valuable chemicals and fuels without emitting CO2, making it a sustainable option for the utilization of natural gas.

[1] "In the past two decades, there has been a strong interest to study the ODH of light alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane), rather than the direct dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, because of the potential commercial interest to utilize alkanes effectively."
[2] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy consumption due to the high temperatures required for direct dehydrogenation, and the risk of over-oxidation leading to the formation of carbon oxides, which reduces the selectivity towards olefins. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, which reduces energy consumption, and by using CO2 as an oxidant instead of oxygen, which helps suppress over-oxidation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Advantages include the potential for energy savings, reduced environmental impact due to lower emissions, and the ability to use less-reactive propane as a feedstock. Limitations include the requirement for efficient catalysts to ensure high selectivity and activity, the potential for coke formation which can deplete catalyst activity over time, and the complexity in optimizing reaction conditions for maximum yield and selectivity.

1. Current propylene production methods often face challenges related to the high cost and environmental impact of raw materials and energy consumption. These methods, particularly those relying on high-temperature operations, can lead to inefficiencies and safety concerns. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more sustainable and energy-efficient process for propylene production. 

2. By utilizing CO2 as an oxidant, ODHP presents advantages in terms of CO2 utilization and reduced environmental impact. It allows for the conversion of lighter alkanes to more valuable chemical products without emitting CO2, thereby contributing positively to carbon balance. However, it also faces challenges such as the need for effective catalyst development and the management of byproducts like CO.

3. In the context of oxidant selection, ODHP demonstrates that CO2 can serve as a viable alternative to oxygen for selective oxidation reactions. This reduces the risk of over-oxidation and enhances the selectivity towards olefins, making it a promising alternative to traditional methods. 

4. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP relate to its exothermic nature and the potential for over-oxidation, which can compromise product selectivity and require additional energy for heat removal. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers a safer and more controlled reaction environment, facilitating the selective production of olefins.

[1] "For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property dominates the catalytic activity."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has a much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, the abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to produce coke precursors."

[3] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

[4] "In those reactions, CO2 can have different roles, depending on the catalyst systems and reactions: (i) CO2 can produce active oxygen species; (ii) CO2 reoxidizes the reduced oxides, forming the redox cycle; and (iii) CO2 oxidizes the carbon species, reducing coking."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include coking problems and over-oxidation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an alternative that utilizes CO2 as a mild oxidant. This reduces the risk of coking and over-oxidation. 

2. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP are its tendency to cause deep oxidation, potentially leading to the formation of carbon oxides. Oxygen can also promote gas-phase radical reactions, which may affect the selectivity of the process. 

3. CO2 offers several advantages over oxygen in propylene production. It produces fewer by-products, specifically CO instead of CO2. It also does not induce gas-phase radical reactions, maintaining better control over the reaction. Additionally, CO2 can be used as an effective oxidant, suppressing deep oxidation and improving selectivity towards olefins.

4. The role of CO2 in these reactions varies based on the catalyst system and reaction conditions. It can either produce active oxygen species, participate in a redox cycle, or oxidize carbon species to prevent coking. However, the detailed reaction mechanisms and active sites for hydrocarbon activation remain under debate and require further investigation.

4. 在这些反应中，二氧化碳的作用因催化剂系统和反应条件而异。它可以产生活性氧物种、参与氧化还原循环或氧化碳物种以防止结焦。然而，对于烃类活化的确切反应机制和活性位点仍存在争议，需要进一步的研究。
