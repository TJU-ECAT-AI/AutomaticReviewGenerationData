[1] "Dehydrogenation of alkanes by CO2 to olefins is a promising alternative to dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by oxygen, which suffer from either coking problems or over-oxidation."
[2] "For all reactions of alkanes with oxygen (reaction 25), the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing the heat of reaction, and the conversion becomes significant at a much lower reaction temperature."
[3] "However, because of the exothermic characteristics of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."
[4] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[5] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant for the partial oxidation of lower alkanes may become an important route for the utilization of natural gas."
[6] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources."
[7] "These reactions include CH4 coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."
[8] "It is shown that the use of CO2 instead of oxygen provides an effective method of CO2 utilization in selective oxidation."

Propylene production faces challenges related to coking problems and over-oxidation in traditional dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) processes utilizing oxygen. CO2 offers an alternative as a mild oxidant, providing benefits such as preventing coking and avoiding over-oxidation. Its use in partial oxidation of lower alkanes and as a mild oxidant for selective oxidation processes demonstrates its effectiveness in overcoming some of the drawbacks of conventional propylene production methods. CO2 can be efficiently utilized to transform natural gas, including methane and other lower alkanes, into valuable chemicals and fuels without emitting CO2, making it a sustainable option for the utilization of natural gas.

在传统的使用氧气的脱氢和氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中，丙烯生产面临焦化问题和过度氧化的挑战。二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂提供了一种替代方案，可以防止焦化并避免过度氧化。其在部分烷烃氧化和选择性氧化过程中的应用表明，它能够克服传统丙烯生产方法的一些缺点。二氧化碳可以有效地利用天然气，包括甲烷和其他低级烷烃，将其转化为有价值的化学品和燃料，而不排放二氧化碳，这使其成为可持续利用天然气的一种选择。
