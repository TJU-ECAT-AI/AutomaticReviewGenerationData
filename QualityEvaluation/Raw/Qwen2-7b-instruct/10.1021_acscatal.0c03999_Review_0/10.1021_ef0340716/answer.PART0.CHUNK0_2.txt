[1] "The wide availability and low price of light alkanes make them among the least reactive and chemically most stable natural resources. These hydrocarbons are mostly used as a fuel; however, their potential as feedstock for more-useful chemical products is of great practical interest."
[2] "The inevitable formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and CO2 from the reactant (CH4) and products (C2H4 and C2H6) (reactions 35), however, seems to be one of the most serious problems, from a practical point of view."
[3] "Because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides to give high selectivity toward olefins."
[4] "However, because of the exothermic characteristic of these reactions in the presence of oxygen, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid the over-oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, to give high selectivity toward the olefins."
[5] "It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[6] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant for the partial oxidation of lower alkanes may become an important route for the utilization of natural gas."
[7] "It is known that the natural gas in many areas contains CO2 in a large quantity, in addition to CH4 and other lower alkanes. It would be highly desirable to utilize such low-valued natural gas without emission of CO2 via the simultaneous transformation of CH4 and other lower alkanes to valuable chemicals or fuels."
[8] "These reactions include CH4 coupling to ethylene (C2H4), C2C4 alkanes dehydrogenation to their corresponding olefins, dehydroaromerization of lower hydrocarbons to benzene (C6H6), and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) to styrene."
[9] "The use of CO2 instead of oxygen provides an effective method of CO2 utilization in selective oxidation."

1. Current propylene production methods often face challenges related to the high cost and environmental impact of raw materials and energy consumption. These methods, particularly those relying on high-temperature operations, can lead to inefficiencies and safety concerns. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more sustainable and energy-efficient process for propylene production. 

2. By utilizing CO2 as an oxidant, ODHP presents advantages in terms of CO2 utilization and reduced environmental impact. It allows for the conversion of lighter alkanes to more valuable chemical products without emitting CO2, thereby contributing positively to carbon balance. However, it also faces challenges such as the need for effective catalyst development and the management of byproducts like CO.

3. In the context of oxidant selection, ODHP demonstrates that CO2 can serve as a viable alternative to oxygen for selective oxidation reactions. This reduces the risk of over-oxidation and enhances the selectivity towards olefins, making it a promising alternative to traditional methods. 

4. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP relate to its exothermic nature and the potential for over-oxidation, which can compromise product selectivity and require additional energy for heat removal. CO2, as a milder oxidant, offers a safer and more controlled reaction environment, facilitating the selective production of olefins.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法经常面临与原材料和能源消耗成本高以及环境影响有关的问题。这些方法，尤其是依赖于高温操作的方法，可能导致效率低下和安全问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种更可持续和能源高效的过程来解决丙烯生产的问题。

2. 利用二氧化碳作为氧化剂，ODHP表现出在二氧化碳利用和减少环境影响方面的优势。它允许将较轻的烷烃转化为更有价值的化学产品而不排放二氧化碳，从而对碳平衡产生积极贡献。然而，它也面临着催化剂开发的有效性以及副产品如一氧化碳管理的挑战。

3. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，ODHP表明二氧化碳可以作为氧气的替代物用于选择性氧化反应。这降低了过氧化的风险并提高了烯烃的选择性，使其成为传统方法的有前景的替代方案。

4. 使用氧气在ODHP中面临的特定挑战与它的放热性质和可能的过氧化有关，这可能损害产物选择性和需要额外的能量进行热量去除。二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂提供了更安全和可控的反应环境，有助于选择性地生成烯烃。
