[1] "For all these reactions, several efficient catalyst systems have been developed, and their redox property dominates the catalytic activity."

[2] "In the dehydrogenation of a higher alkane, the produced alkenes contain allylic hydrogen, which has a much lower bond dissociation energy than that of starting alkanes. Thus, the abstraction of hydrogen from the allylic position may proceed more rapidly to produce coke precursors."

[3] "CO2 as an oxidant can suppress the deactivation of the catalyst and increase energy savings."

[4] "In those reactions, CO2 can have different roles, depending on the catalyst systems and reactions: (i) CO2 can produce active oxygen species; (ii) CO2 reoxidizes the reduced oxides, forming the redox cycle; and (iii) CO2 oxidizes the carbon species, reducing coking."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include coking problems and over-oxidation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an alternative that utilizes CO2 as a mild oxidant. This reduces the risk of coking and over-oxidation. 

2. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP are its tendency to cause deep oxidation, potentially leading to the formation of carbon oxides. Oxygen can also promote gas-phase radical reactions, which may affect the selectivity of the process. 

3. CO2 offers several advantages over oxygen in propylene production. It produces fewer by-products, specifically CO instead of CO2. It also does not induce gas-phase radical reactions, maintaining better control over the reaction. Additionally, CO2 can be used as an effective oxidant, suppressing deep oxidation and improving selectivity towards olefins.

4. The role of CO2 in these reactions varies based on the catalyst system and reaction conditions. It can either produce active oxygen species, participate in a redox cycle, or oxidize carbon species to prevent coking. However, the detailed reaction mechanisms and active sites for hydrocarbon activation remain under debate and require further investigation.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括结焦问题和过度氧化。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过利用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂来解决这些问题，从而降低了结焦和过度氧化的风险。

2. 使用氧气在ODHP中面临的具体挑战是其可能导致深度氧化，潜在地导致碳氧化物的形成。氧气也可能促进气体相自由基反应，这可能会影响过程的选择性。

3. 与氧气相比，二氧化碳在丙烯生产中提供了一些优势。它产生的副产品较少，仅产生CO而不是CO2。它也不会引发气体相自由基反应，从而更好地控制反应。此外，二氧化碳可以作为有效的氧化剂使用，抑制深度氧化并提高向烯烃的选择性。

4. 在这些反应中，二氧化碳的作用因催化剂系统和反应条件而异。它可以产生活性氧物种、参与氧化还原循环或氧化碳物种以防止结焦。然而，对于烃类活化的确切反应机制和活性位点仍存在争议，需要进一步的研究。
