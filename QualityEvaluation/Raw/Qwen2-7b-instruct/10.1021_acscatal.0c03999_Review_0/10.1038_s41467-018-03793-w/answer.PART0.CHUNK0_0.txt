1. Current propylene production methods face challenges due to the inherent variability and insufficiency in co-production from steam crackers, leading to a global production gap. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this by combining two underused reactants—propane and CO2—to produce propylene. This method uses CO2 as a mild oxidant, reducing the need for high temperatures and suppressing over-oxidation, which minimizes the production of carbon oxides.

2. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as an oxidant into the feed changes the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from propane, releasing heat that reduces operating temperatures. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, preventing over-oxidation and minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

3. At 823 K, the CO2 equilibrium conversion for dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98%, significantly higher than that of methane dry reforming (DRM). This lower temperature requirement helps reduce catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations, common in DRM at higher temperatures.

4. Identifying catalysts capable of selectively breaking the CH bond to produce propylene or the CC bonds to generate synthesis gas (CO + H2) is crucial for optimizing the ODHP process. The synergy between metals in bimetallic catalysts can enhance propylene yield and selectivity.

5. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrated promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, producing 58.2% C3H6 selectivity. This is notably higher than that of monometallic catalysts, indicating a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst.

6. The Ni3Pt catalyst showed robust activity for the DRP reaction, with a selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions. The selectivity and stability of Ni3Pt compare favorably to monometallic Ni3, highlighting the benefits of coupling Ni with precious metal Pt.

7. The activation energy for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation over Fe3Ni was determined to be 115 kJ mol−1, while the activation energy for reforming over Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol−1. These values reflect the kinetic differences between the two processes, with Fe3Ni showing a slightly lower activation barrier.

8. The coordination numbers of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Ni bonds in the Ni3Pt catalyst were determined to be 3.4 and 6.4, respectively, confirming the formation of a Pt-Ni bimetallic bond. This structural feature is essential for understanding the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst in the ODHP process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临蒸汽裂解协同生产的变异性不足和效率低下的挑战，导致全球丙烯产量缺口。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过结合两种未充分利用的反应物——丙烷和CO2——来生产丙烯，从而解决了这一问题。这种方法使用CO2作为温和的氧化剂，减少了需要的高温需求，并抑制了过氧化，从而最大限度地减少了碳氧化物的生成。

2. 直接丙烷脱氢（DDP）是热力学限制的，且高度吸热（ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol），需要超过973 K的温度才能获得显著的丙烯产率。将CO2引入作为氧化剂可以改变脱氢路径，通过氧化从烷烃中提取的氢并释放反应热量，从而降低操作温度。CO2作为温和的氧化剂，防止过氧化并最大限度地减少碳氧化物的生成。

3. 在823 K下，干重整丙烷（DRP）的CO2平衡转化率可达到98%，远高于甲烷干重整（DRM）的温度。这较低的温度要求有助于降低由于焦化和相转变导致的催化剂失活，这是在较高温度下进行DRM时常见的问题。

4. 确定能够选择性地断裂CH键以产生丙烯或断裂CC键以生成合成气（CO + H2）的催化剂对于优化ODHP过程至关重要。二元催化剂中金属之间的协同作用可以增强丙烯产率和选择性。

5. Fe3Ni催化剂在CO2-ODHP途径中显示出对丙烯的有希望的选择性，产生了58.2%的C3H6选择性。这明显高于单金属催化剂，表明了Fe3Ni双金属催化剂形成时的协同效应。

6. Ni3Pt催化剂在DRP反应中显示出了良好的活性，其CO选择性为88%，在与之相当的反应物转化率下。Ni3Pt与单金属Ni3相比，在选择性和稳定性方面表现得更优，突出显示了Ni与贵金属Pt耦合的好处。

7. Fe3Ni催化剂上丙烷CO2氧化脱氢的活化能被确定为115 kJ mol−1，而Ni3Pt催化剂上的重整活化能为119 kJ mol−1。这些值反映了两个过程之间的动力学差异，Fe3Ni显示出略低的活化壁垒。

8. Ni3Pt催化剂上Pt-Pt和Pt-Ni键的配位数分别为3.4和6.4，证实形成了Pt-Ni双金属键。这种结构特征对于理解催化剂在ODHP过程中的活性和选择性至关重要。
