1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the inherent variability and insufficiencies in co-producing propylene from steam crackers, leading to a global production gap. This has prompted the development of more purpose-built propylene technologies. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically challenging, requiring high temperatures that may not yield significant propylene efficiently. Using CO2 as an oxidant in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by reducing the need for high temperatures and minimizing over-oxidation, thus lowering the production of carbon oxides. Additionally, it can consume CO2, a greenhouse gas, and reduce catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 combines two underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. Two types of bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, have been identified for the CO2 + C3H8 system. Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production, while Ni3Pt shows high selectivity for CO production.

3. The activation barriers for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) and reforming over Ni3Pt are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively. This indicates that the rate of reaction decreases as the partial pressure of one reactant exceeds the other, suggesting competitive adsorption of adsorbates and surface intermediates.

4. In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements indicate that under reaction conditions, the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt, while both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consist of metallic Ni. The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst is in an oxidized form, and the coordination number of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Ni bonds in the Ni3Pt catalyst is 3.4 and 6.4, respectively.

5. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway. This is consistent with experimental observations and supports the findings of DFT calculations.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解过程中丙烯生产的固有变异性不足，导致全球丙烯生产缺口。这促使行业开发了更多专门用于丙烯生产的技术。直接丙烷脱氢（DDP）从热力学上是有限的，并且需要高度吸热（ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol），可能需要超过973 K的温度来获得有效的丙烯产量。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）中解决了这些问题，通过降低所需温度和减少过氧化作用，从而减少碳氧化物的产生，降低催化剂焦化和由较高温度引起的相转变。此外，它还可以消耗二氧化碳这种温室气体，并减少催化剂因焦化而失效的可能性。

2. 二氧化碳与丙烷的氧化脱氢结合了两种未充分利用的反应物，以生产丙烯或合成气。已识别出两种双金属催化剂，Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt，用于CO2 + C3H8系统。Fe3Ni对于丙烯生产具有选择性，而Ni3Pt对于CO生产显示出高选择性。

3. 丙烷CO2氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）和Ni3Pt重整的活化壁垒分别为115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1。这意味着当一种反应物的分压超过另一种时，反应速率下降，暗示吸附剂和表面中间体的竞争吸附。

4. 在线原位X射线吸收边谱（XANES）测量表明，在反应条件下，Ni3Pt催化剂由金属Pt组成，而Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂都由金属Ni组成。Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe处于氧化状态，而Ni3Pt催化剂中的Pt-Pt和Pt-Ni键的协调数分别为3.4和6.4。

5. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示，bulk Fe3Ni(111)表面和FeO/Ni(111)界面促进CH键断裂，适用于CO2-ODHP途径，而Pt-终止Ni3Pt(111)表面促进CC键断裂，适用于DRP途径。这些发现与实验观察结果一致，并支持DFT计算的结果。
