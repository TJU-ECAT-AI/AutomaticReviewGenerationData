1. Challenges in current propylene production methods include variability and insufficiencies in co-production from steam crackers, leading to concerns over the global propylene production gap. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by combining two underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. It also allows for the consumption of greenhouse gases like CO2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), increasing propane conversion. This reduces catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations, which are common at high temperatures used in processes like methane dry reforming (DRM). Additionally, unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction, maintaining catalyst efficiency.

2. In the context of ODHP, the presence of CO2 can enhance the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through RWGS. This leads to a reduction in catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations typically induced by high temperatures in DRM processes. Furthermore, unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction, which occurs at relatively low temperatures.

3. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive examination of supported bimetallic catalysts that allow both the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and dry reforming pathways to occur simultaneously. This approach could potentially optimize the use of both propane and CO2 as feedstocks for propylene production.

4. The document provides results on conversions and product selectivity for various catalysts over time, indicating that the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect in propylene production compared to monometallic catalysts.

5. The apparent activation energies for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Fe3Ni and reforming over Ni3Pt were determined to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively. These values help understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions involved.

6. The surfaces in the DFT calculations were initially modified by *O atoms, assuming that *CO2 dissociates to form *CO + *O. This step is crucial for understanding the potential pathways of the reactions on these surfaces.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解中丙烯共生产的变异性不足，这引发了全球丙烯生产缺口的担忧，并推动行业开发更专注于丙烯的技术。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过结合两种未充分利用的反应物来生产丙烯或合成气，从而解决了这些问题，并通过逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS）消耗温室气体如二氧化碳，增加丙烷转化率。这减少了由于在甲烷干重整（DRM）过程中通常使用的高温度导致的催化剂失活。此外，未反应的二氧化碳可以通过布杜瓦反应去除表面碳，维持催化剂效率，在相对较低的温度下进行。
