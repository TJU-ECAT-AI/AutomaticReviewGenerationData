1. Current propylene production methods face challenges due to the inherent variability and insufficiency in co-production from steam crackers, leading to a global production gap. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this by combining two underused reactants—propane and CO2—to produce propylene. This method uses CO2 as a mild oxidant, reducing the need for high temperatures and suppressing over-oxidation, which minimizes the production of carbon oxides.

2. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, requiring temperatures that may exceed 973 K for significant propylene yields. The introduction of CO2 as an oxidant into the feed changes the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing the abstracted hydrogen from propane, releasing heat that reduces operating temperatures. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, preventing over-oxidation and minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

3. At 823 K, the CO2 equilibrium conversion for dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98%, significantly higher than that of methane dry reforming (DRM). This lower temperature requirement helps reduce catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations, common in DRM at higher temperatures.

4. Identifying catalysts capable of selectively breaking the CH bond to produce propylene or the CC bonds to generate synthesis gas (CO + H2) is crucial for optimizing the ODHP process. The synergy between metals in bimetallic catalysts can enhance propylene yield and selectivity.

5. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrated promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, producing 58.2% C3H6 selectivity. This is notably higher than that of monometallic catalysts, indicating a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst.

6. The Ni3Pt catalyst showed robust activity for the DRP reaction, with a selectivity toward CO of 88% at comparable reactant conversions. The selectivity and stability of Ni3Pt compare favorably to monometallic Ni3, highlighting the benefits of coupling Ni with precious metal Pt.

7. The activation energy for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation over Fe3Ni was determined to be 115 kJ mol−1, while the activation energy for reforming over Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol−1. These values reflect the kinetic differences between the two processes, with Fe3Ni showing a slightly lower activation barrier.

8. The coordination numbers of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Ni bonds in the Ni3Pt catalyst were determined to be 3.4 and 6.4, respectively, confirming the formation of a Pt-Ni bimetallic bond. This structural feature is essential for understanding the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst in the ODHP process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临蒸汽裂解协同生产的变异性不足和效率低下的挑战，导致全球丙烯产量缺口。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过结合两种未充分利用的反应物——丙烷和CO2——来生产丙烯，从而解决了这一问题。这种方法使用CO2作为温和的氧化剂，减少了需要的高温需求，并抑制了过氧化，从而最大限度地减少了碳氧化物的生成。

2. 直接丙烷脱氢（DDP）是热力学限制的，且高度吸热（ΔHr = 29.70 kcal/mol），需要超过973 K的温度才能获得显著的丙烯产率。将CO2引入作为氧化剂可以改变脱氢路径，通过氧化从烷烃中提取的氢并释放反应热量，从而降低操作温度。CO2作为温和的氧化剂，防止过氧化并最大限度地减少碳氧化物的生成。

3. 在823 K下，干重整丙烷（DRP）的CO2平衡转化率可达到98%，远高于甲烷干重整（DRM）的温度。这较低的温度要求有助于降低由于焦化和相转变导致的催化剂失活，这是在较高温度下进行DRM时常见的问题。

4. 确定能够选择性地断裂CH键以产生丙烯或断裂CC键以生成合成气（CO + H2）的催化剂对于优化ODHP过程至关重要。二元催化剂中金属之间的协同作用可以增强丙烯产率和选择性。

5. Fe3Ni催化剂在CO2-ODHP途径中显示出对丙烯的有希望的选择性，产生了58.2%的C3H6选择性。这明显高于单金属催化剂，表明了Fe3Ni双金属催化剂形成时的协同效应。

6. Ni3Pt催化剂在DRP反应中显示出了良好的活性，其CO选择性为88%，在与之相当的反应物转化率下。Ni3Pt与单金属Ni3相比，在选择性和稳定性方面表现得更优，突出显示了Ni与贵金属Pt耦合的好处。

7. Fe3Ni催化剂上丙烷CO2氧化脱氢的活化能被确定为115 kJ mol−1，而Ni3Pt催化剂上的重整活化能为119 kJ mol−1。这些值反映了两个过程之间的动力学差异，Fe3Ni显示出略低的活化壁垒。

8. Ni3Pt催化剂上Pt-Pt和Pt-Ni键的配位数分别为3.4和6.4，证实形成了Pt-Ni双金属键。这种结构特征对于理解催化剂在ODHP过程中的活性和选择性至关重要。

1. Challenges in current propylene production methods include variability and insufficiencies in co-production from steam crackers, leading to concerns over the global propylene production gap. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by combining two underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. It also allows for the consumption of greenhouse gases like CO2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), increasing propane conversion. This reduces catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations, which are common at high temperatures used in processes like methane dry reforming (DRM). Additionally, unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction, maintaining catalyst efficiency.

2. In the context of ODHP, the presence of CO2 can enhance the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through RWGS. This leads to a reduction in catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations typically induced by high temperatures in DRM processes. Furthermore, unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction, which occurs at relatively low temperatures.

3. The study highlights the need for a comprehensive examination of supported bimetallic catalysts that allow both the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and dry reforming pathways to occur simultaneously. This approach could potentially optimize the use of both propane and CO2 as feedstocks for propylene production.

4. The document provides results on conversions and product selectivity for various catalysts over time, indicating that the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst exhibits a synergistic effect in propylene production compared to monometallic catalysts.

5. The apparent activation energies for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Fe3Ni and reforming over Ni3Pt were determined to be 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively. These values help understand the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions involved.

6. The surfaces in the DFT calculations were initially modified by *O atoms, assuming that *CO2 dissociates to form *CO + *O. This step is crucial for understanding the potential pathways of the reactions on these surfaces.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解中丙烯共生产的变异性不足，这引发了全球丙烯生产缺口的担忧，并推动行业开发更专注于丙烯的技术。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过结合两种未充分利用的反应物来生产丙烯或合成气，从而解决了这些问题，并通过逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS）消耗温室气体如二氧化碳，增加丙烷转化率。这减少了由于在甲烷干重整（DRM）过程中通常使用的高温度导致的催化剂失活。此外，未反应的二氧化碳可以通过布杜瓦反应去除表面碳，维持催化剂效率，在相对较低的温度下进行。

2. 在ODHP背景下，二氧化碳的存在可以增强丙烷的平衡转化率，通过逆水煤气变换反应（RWGS）消耗氢气。这导致催化剂失活减少，由于在DRM过程中常见的由高温度引起的结焦和相变。此外，未反应的二氧化碳可以通过布杜瓦反应去除表面碳，该反应在相对较低的温度下发生。

3. 研究强调了同时考虑支持双金属催化剂的必要性，这些催化剂允许氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）和干燥重整两条路径同时发生。这种方法可能能够优化作为生产丙烯原料的两种反应物的使用。

4. 文档提供了不同催化剂在时间上的转换和产品选择性的结果，表明与单一金属催化剂相比，双金属Fe3Ni催化剂在丙烯生产方面表现出协同效应。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the inherent variability and insufficiencies in co-producing propylene from steam crackers, leading to concerns about the global propylene production gap. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and requires high temperatures for significant propylene yields. Introducing CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing hydrogen from the alkane, releasing heat that reduces operating temperatures. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) reaches a higher equilibrium conversion compared to direct dehydrogenation of propane. Dry reforming (DRP) of propane can reach high equilibrium conversion at lower temperatures than methane dry reforming (DRM), reducing catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations. The goal is to identify catalysts that can selectively break the CH or CC bonds to produce propylene or synthesis gas, respectively.

2. Chromium catalysts are used in previous work on CO2-ODH due to their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states, but their short lifecycles and high toxicity limit their implementation. Nickel is used for dry reforming, but severe coking causes catalyst deactivation. The present work explores ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, including Fe3Ni, Fe3Pt, and Ni3Pt, that are active at 823 K.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the inherent variability and insufficiencies in co-producing propylene from steam crackers, leading to a global production gap. This has prompted the development of more purpose-built propylene technologies. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically challenging, requiring high temperatures that may not yield significant propylene efficiently. Using CO2 as an oxidant in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP) addresses these issues by reducing the need for high temperatures and minimizing over-oxidation, thus lowering the production of carbon oxides. Additionally, it can consume CO2, a greenhouse gas, and reduce catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 combines two underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. Two types of bimetallic catalysts, Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, have been identified for the CO2 + C3H8 system. Fe3Ni is selective for propylene production, while Ni3Pt shows high selectivity for CO production.

3. The activation barriers for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) and reforming over Ni3Pt are 115 kJ mol−1 and 119 kJ mol−1, respectively. This indicates that the rate of reaction decreases as the partial pressure of one reactant exceeds the other, suggesting competitive adsorption of adsorbates and surface intermediates.

4. In situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements indicate that under reaction conditions, the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt, while both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consist of metallic Ni. The Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst is in an oxidized form, and the coordination number of the Pt-Pt and Pt-Ni bonds in the Ni3Pt catalyst is 3.4 and 6.4, respectively.

5. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni(111) interface favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface favors the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway. This is consistent with experimental observations and supports the findings of DFT calculations.

2. 二氧化碳与丙烷的氧化脱氢结合了两种未充分利用的反应物，以生产丙烯或合成气。已识别出两种双金属催化剂，Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt，用于CO2 + C3H8系统。Fe3Ni对于丙烯生产具有选择性，而Ni3Pt对于CO生产显示出高选择性。

3. 丙烷CO2氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）和Ni3Pt重整的活化壁垒分别为115 kJ mol−1和119 kJ mol−1。这意味着当一种反应物的分压超过另一种时，反应速率下降，暗示吸附剂和表面中间体的竞争吸附。

4. 在线原位X射线吸收边谱（XANES）测量表明，在反应条件下，Ni3Pt催化剂由金属Pt组成，而Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂都由金属Ni组成。Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe处于氧化状态，而Ni3Pt催化剂中的Pt-Pt和Pt-Ni键的协调数分别为3.4和6.4。

5. 密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示，bulk Fe3Ni(111)表面和FeO/Ni(111)界面促进CH键断裂，适用于CO2-ODHP途径，而Pt-终止Ni3Pt(111)表面促进CC键断裂，适用于DRP途径。这些发现与实验观察结果一致，并支持DFT计算的结果。
