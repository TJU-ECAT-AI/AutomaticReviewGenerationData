1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the inherent variability and insufficiencies in co-producing propylene from steam crackers, which has led to concerns about the global propylene production gap. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially filling the production gap while consuming a greenhouse gas. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing the production of carbon oxides.

2. The use of supported chromium catalysts in CO2-ODH is limited due to their short lifecycles and high toxicity. Nickel is typically used for dry reforming, but it faces challenges like severe coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. In contrast, bimetallic catalysts like Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt offer promising alternatives.

3. In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy helps determine the oxidation states of metals under reaction conditions, while density functional theory calculations identify the most favorable reaction pathways. These methods contribute to understanding and optimizing the performance of the catalysts.

4. The combination of CO2 and propane in the ODHP process has the potential to utilize underutilized reactants efficiently. This approach not only produces propylene but also mitigates CO2 emissions, aligning with environmental goals.

5. The DFT calculations predict that the Fe3Ni catalyst surface favors the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, promoting the formation of propylene. Meanwhile, the Ni3Pt catalyst is active for dry reforming, producing synthesis gas. These findings are consistent with experimental observations.

6. The in situ XANES measurements reveal that Fe3Ni consists of oxidized iron and metallic nickel, providing insights into the local environment of the metals under reaction conditions. This information is crucial for understanding the catalyst's behavior and optimizing its performance.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解催化剂生产丙烯时的固有变异性与不足，这引发了全球丙烯生产缺口的担忧，并促使行业开发更专一的丙烯技术。通过CO2氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以填补这一缺口，同时消耗温室气体。二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，可以抑制过氧化反应，减少碳氧化物的生成。

2. 在CO2-ODH中，使用支持型铬催化剂受到其短寿命和高毒性限制。镍主要用于干重整，但严重的积碳导致催化剂失活仍然是一个问题。相比之下，双金属催化剂如Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt提供了有前景的替代方案。

3. 在位X射线吸收近边结构光谱法有助于确定金属在反应条件下的氧化状态，而密度泛函理论计算则识别出最有利的反应途径。这些方法对于理解并优化催化剂性能具有重要意义。

4. 将CO2与丙烷结合进行ODHP过程，有可能高效利用未充分利用的反应物。这一方法不仅生产丙烯，还能有效减少二氧化碳排放，符合环境目标。
