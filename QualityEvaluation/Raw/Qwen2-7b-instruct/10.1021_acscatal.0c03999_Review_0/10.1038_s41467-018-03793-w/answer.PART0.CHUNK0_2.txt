1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the inherent variability and insufficiencies in co-producing propylene from steam crackers, leading to concerns about the global propylene production gap. Direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) is thermodynamically limited and requires high temperatures for significant propylene yields. Introducing CO2 as a mild oxidant into the feed can alter the dehydrogenation pathway by oxidizing hydrogen from the alkane, releasing heat that reduces operating temperatures. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) reaches a higher equilibrium conversion compared to direct dehydrogenation of propane. Dry reforming (DRP) of propane can reach high equilibrium conversion at lower temperatures than methane dry reforming (DRM), reducing catalyst deactivation due to coking and phase transformations. The goal is to identify catalysts that can selectively break the CH or CC bonds to produce propylene or synthesis gas, respectively.

2. Chromium catalysts are used in previous work on CO2-ODH due to their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states, but their short lifecycles and high toxicity limit their implementation. Nickel is used for dry reforming, but severe coking causes catalyst deactivation. The present work explores ceria-supported bimetallic catalysts, including Fe3Ni, Fe3Pt, and Ni3Pt, that are active at 823 K.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解器共产丙烯时的固有变异性与不足，这引发了全球丙烯产量缺口的担忧，并促使行业开发更多专用于丙烯的技术。直接丙烷脱氢（DDP）是热力学限制的，需要超过973 K的温度才能获得显著的丙烯产率。将二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂引入反应物中可以改变脱氢途径，通过氧化烷烃中的氢并释放反应热来降低操作温度。二氧化碳与丙烷的氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）在823 K的温度下达到的平衡转化率高于直接丙烷脱氢（DDP）。丙烷干重整（DRP）在比甲烷干重整（DRM）低150 K的温度下可以达到高达98%的平衡转化率，从而减少了由于较高温度而引起的催化剂焦化和相转变导致的催化剂失活。目标是识别能够选择性地断裂CH或CC键以产生丙烯或合成气（CO + H2）的催化剂。

2. 在以前的CO2-ODH工作中，由于铬催化剂能够存在多种氧化状态，因此主要使用支持的铬催化剂，但其短暂的使用寿命和高毒性限制了其实施。镍主要用于干重整，但由于严重的焦化，催化剂活性仍然存在问题。当前的工作探索了铈基双金属催化剂，包括Fe3Ni、Fe3Pt和Ni3Pt，这些催化剂在823 K时活性。
