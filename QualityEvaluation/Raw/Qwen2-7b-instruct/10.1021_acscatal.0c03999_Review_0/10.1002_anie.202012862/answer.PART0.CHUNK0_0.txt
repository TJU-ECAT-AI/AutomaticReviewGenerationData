[1] "Despite the abundance of OCM research findings, achieving a high yield of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) remains a major challenge. It has been estimated that a C2 yield of at least 30% will be necessary for OCM commercialization, yet few catalytic systems are able to approach this benchmark."
[2] "The main limiting factor is the formation of the aforementioned COx byproducts. Thus, approaches that seek to suppress the formation of CO2 and CO from methane or C2 products will be necessary to achieve high yields of the desired products."
[3] "One conceivable strategy to enhance OCM selectivity is to control the types of active oxidizing species that are present under reaction conditions. The replacement of O2 with other oxidants is one possible approach to achieve this goal."
[4] "Of course, catalyst- and reaction-dependent kinetic considerations relating to oxidant activation may also lead to mechanistic pathway differences when alternative oxidants are employed."
[5] "N2O can only provide a monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·. Dioxygen, in contrast, can form peroxo species under OCM reaction conditions that are precursors to CO2."
[6] "In fact, several catalysts achieve C2 yields greater than 10%, which is greater than or on par with numerous O2-OCM systems."
[7] "Furthermore, CO2 is unlikely to interact with ·CH3 radicals in the gas phase."
[8] "Thermodynamic analyses place equilibrium CH4 conversions in the range of 10-30% in the temperature range."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving high yields of C2 products (ethane and ethylene), with a minimum of 30% required for commercialization. Most catalytic systems struggle to meet this benchmark due to the formation of unwanted COx byproducts. Approaches aimed at suppressing CO2 and CO formation from methane or C2 products are essential for improving C2 yields.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient way to produce propylene. By controlling the types of active oxidizing species present under reaction conditions, ODHP seeks to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The use of alternative oxidants in ODHP is a viable strategy to achieve this goal, considering the influence of catalyst-dependent kinetic factors and oxidant activation on the reaction mechanisms.

3. Using N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages, including the potential for enhanced C2 selectivity due to its mild oxidizing tendency. Unlike O2, N2O only provides monoatomic oxygen species (such as O-·) which reduces the risk of overoxidation. This could lead to a higher C2 yield, surpassing many O2-OCM systems.

4. CO2, another alternative oxidant, presents unique benefits in ODHP. Its endergonic nature and lack of interaction with CH3 radicals in the gas phase make it a suitable choice. CO2-OCM can potentially improve C2 selectivity by avoiding the formation of CO and CO2 as byproducts, unlike O2-OCM. Thermodynamic analyses indicate that achieving a significant CH4 conversion in ODHP is feasible within the temperature range of 10-30%.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括难以达到高C2产品（乙烷和乙烯）产量，商业化的最低要求为至少30%，但大多数催化系统难以达到这一标准。由于甲烷或C2产品的COx副产物形成，导致产量受限。抑制甲烷或C2产品中CO2和CO的形成是提高C2产量的关键。

2. 通过控制反应条件下活性氧化物种类型，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）解决了这些难题，提供了更高效的丙烯生产方式。通过调整活性氧化物种，ODHP寻求提高选择性和效率。使用替代氧化剂在ODHP中的应用是一个可行策略，考虑到催化剂依赖性动力学因素和氧化剂激活对反应机制的影响。

3. 将N2O用作氧化剂在ODHP中提供了一些优势，包括可能增强C2选择性，由于其温和的氧化性质。与O2不同，N2O仅提供单原子氧物种（如O-·），降低了过氧化的风险。这可能导致更高的C2产量，超过许多O2-OCM系统。

4. CO2作为另一种替代氧化剂，在ODHP中具有独特优势。其内向热力学特性和与CH3基团在气相中不相互作用的特点使其成为合适的选择。CO2-OCM可以潜在地通过避免形成CO和CO2副产物来提高C2选择性，而这是O2-OCM所不具备的。热力学分析表明，在10-30%的温度范围内，实现ODHP中的显著CH4转化是可行的。
