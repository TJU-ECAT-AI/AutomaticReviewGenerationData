[1] "The rise of shale gas in the past decade has led to a renewed interest in upgrading methane to value-added chemicals."
[2] "However, despite the abundance of OCM research findings, achieving a high yield of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) remains a major challenge."
[3] "Of course, catalyst- and reaction-dependent"
[4] "Table 1 summarizes the Gibbs free energies for methane coupling and overoxidation in OCM with O2, N2O, CO2, and S2."
[5] "Note that although N2O-OCM is thermodynamically more downhill than O2-OCM, the kinetic tendency of the catalyst to activate the oxidant is also an important parameter that influences reactivity."
[6] "It has been estimated that there is an upper limit of 28% single pass C2 yield for OCM in the presence of gas phase O2 under typical O2/CH4 cofeed conditions."
[7] "Additionally, the range of possible oxidant/CH4 ratios is far wider when using N2O, as there is no threat of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion as with O2."
[8] "For most of these catalysts, the use of N2O leads to reduced methane conversions, but improved C2 selectivities versus O2 as the oxidant."
[9] "In fact, several catalysts achieve C2 yields greater than 10%, which is greater than or on par with numerous O2-OCM systems."
[10] "The addition of CO2 could help shift the equilibrium of this process towards the more valuable ethylene by consuming H2 via the reverse water-gas shift reaction (equation 12)."
[11] "Moreover, unlike O2, CO2 is unlikely to interact with ·CH3 radicals in the gas phase."
[12] "Thermodynamic analyses place equilibrium CH4 conversions in the range of 10-30% in the temperature range"

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving high yields of C2 products, specifically ethane and ethylene, from methane. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for methane conversion, which can be more challenging. ODHP presents advantages in terms of potentially higher efficiency and lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods. However, it also comes with its own set of limitations, including the need for suitable catalysts and operating conditions to maximize propylene yield.

2. When selecting oxidants for propylene production, oxygen is commonly used due to its effectiveness in promoting the desired chemical reactions. Oxygen facilitates the dehydrogenation process by providing the necessary oxygen atoms to react with hydrocarbons. However, the use of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, resulting in the formation of unwanted byproducts such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. To mitigate these issues, alternative oxidants like nitrogen dioxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are considered. These alternatives offer a milder oxidizing environment, potentially reducing the formation of byproducts while still enabling efficient conversion of hydrocarbons to olefins. Each alternative oxidant has unique thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics that influence their effectiveness in propylene production.

3. The thermodynamic analyses suggest that the optimal temperature range for maximizing propylene yield through oxidative dehydrogenation reactions lies between 10% and 30% conversion of methane or propane. This range is crucial because it balances the need for sufficient reaction rates to convert feedstock effectively while minimizing the risk of overreacting and producing unwanted byproducts. Operating within this range ensures that the process is both economically viable and environmentally sustainable, contributing to more efficient and cleaner propylene production.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括从甲烷中高效获得C2产品，特别是乙烷和乙烯。通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，因为它绕过了需要更复杂的甲烷转化步骤，这通常更具挑战性。ODHP的优点在于可能具有更高的效率和更低的环境影响与传统方法相比。然而，它也带来了自己的局限性，包括需要合适的催化剂和操作条件来最大化丙烯产率。

2. 在选择用于丙烯生产的氧化剂时，通常使用氧气，因为它能够有效地促进所需化学反应。氧气通过提供必要的氧原子来与烃类反应，促进脱氢过程。然而，使用氧气可能导致过氧化，导致形成不期望的副产物，如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。为了减轻这些问题，考虑使用替代氧化剂，如氮氧化物（N2O）、二氧化碳（CO2）和二氧化硫（SO2）。这些替代品提供了较为温和的氧化环境，有可能减少副产品的生成，同时仍然允许有效转化烃类为烯烃。每种替代氧化剂都有独特的热力学和动力学特性，影响其在丙烯生产中的有效性。

3. 热力学分析表明，通过氧化脱氢反应最大化丙烯产率的理想温度范围为10%至30%的甲烷或丙烷转化。这个范围至关重要，因为它平衡了足够快的反应速率以有效转化原料的需求，同时尽量减少过度反应和产生不期望副产品的风险。在这个范围内运行确保了过程既经济可行又环境可持续，对更高效的清洁丙烯生产做出了贡献。
