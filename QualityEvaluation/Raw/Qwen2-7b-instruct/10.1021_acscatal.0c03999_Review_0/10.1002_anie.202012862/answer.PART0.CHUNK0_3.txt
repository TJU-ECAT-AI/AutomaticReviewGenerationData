[1] "The rise of shale gas in the past decade has led to a renewed interest in upgrading methane to value-added chemicals."
[2] "Unfortunately, in the presence of an oxidant, the ethane and ethylene also undergo facile oxidation to CO and CO2, reflecting the pronounced thermodynamic stability of these over-oxidation products (Table 1)."
[3] "Of course, catalyst- and reaction-dependent"
[4] "Although N2O is one possible alternative oxidant for OCM and related partial oxidation reactions."
[5] "Like CH4, N2O is a greenhouse gas,and its use in the production of value-added chemicals is desired."
[6] "The literature reports for each different alternative oxidant for X- OCM systems tend to highlight very different aspects of the catalytic reaction."
[7] "For most of these catalysts, the use of N2O leads to reduced methane conversions, but improved C2 selectivities versus O2 as the oxidant."
[8] "The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O  sites,which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals."
[9] "In Pathway 1 (equations 5-6), N2O is activated at a coordination-unsaturated cation to form N2 gas and an O* species."
[10] "However, unlike O2, CO2 is unlikely to interact with ·CH3 radicals in the gas phase."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high cost and complexity of traditional processes, the need for significant energy input, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly method. It presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for intermediate hydrogenation steps. However, the use of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, producing unwanted byproducts like CO and CO2. In contrast, alternative oxidants like nitrogen dioxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) offer milder oxidizing conditions, potentially reducing the formation of byproducts and improving selectivity for propylene. Each of these alternative oxidants has unique thermodynamic characteristics that influence their effectiveness in ODHP, requiring careful selection based on the desired product distribution and efficiency.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括传统工艺成本高、复杂性大、能源需求高以及环境问题。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种可能更节能、成本效益更高且环保的方法，解决了这些挑战。它在氧化剂选择的背景下具有自身的优势和限制。将氧气作为氧化剂使用在ODHP中，允许直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，跳过了中间氢化步骤的需求。然而，使用氧气可能导致过氧化，产生如CO和CO2等副产品。相比之下，氮氧化物（N2O）、二氧化碳（CO2）和二氧化硫（SO2）等替代氧化剂提供了较温和的氧化条件，可能减少副产品的生成并提高丙烯的选择性。每种替代氧化剂都有独特的热力学特性，影响其在ODHP中的有效性，需要根据期望的产品分布和效率进行仔细选择。
