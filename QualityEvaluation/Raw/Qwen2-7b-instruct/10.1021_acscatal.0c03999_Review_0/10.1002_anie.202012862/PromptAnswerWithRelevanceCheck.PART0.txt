It has been estimated that a C2 yield of at least 30% will be necessary for OCM commercialization, yet few catalytic systems are able to approach this benchmark."
[2] "The main limiting factor is the formation of the aforementioned COx byproducts. Thus, approaches that seek to suppress the formation of CO2 and CO from methane or C2 products will be necessary to achieve high yields of the desired products."
[3] "One conceivable strategy to enhance OCM selectivity is to control the types of active oxidizing species that are present under reaction conditions. The replacement of O2 with other oxidants is one possible approach to achieve this goal."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the difficulty in achieving high yields of C2 products (ethane and ethylene), with a minimum of 30% required for commercialization. Most catalytic systems struggle to meet this benchmark due to the formation of unwanted COx byproducts. Approaches aimed at suppressing CO2 and CO formation from methane or C2 products are essential for improving C2 yields.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient way to produce propylene. By controlling the types of active oxidizing species present under reaction conditions, ODHP seeks to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The use of alternative oxidants in ODHP is a viable strategy to achieve this goal, considering the influence of catalyst-dependent kinetic factors and oxidant activation on the reaction mechanisms.

3. Using N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages, including the potential for enhanced C2 selectivity due to its mild oxidizing tendency. Unlike O2, N2O only provides monoatomic oxygen species (such as O-·) which reduces the risk of overoxidation. This could lead to a higher C2 yield, surpassing many O2-OCM systems.

4. CO2, another alternative oxidant, presents unique benefits in ODHP. Its endergonic nature and lack of interaction with CH3 radicals in the gas phase make it a suitable choice. CO2-OCM can potentially improve C2 selectivity by avoiding the formation of CO and CO2 as byproducts, unlike O2-OCM. Thermodynamic analyses indicate that achieving a significant CH4 conversion in ODHP is feasible within the temperature range of 10-30%.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括难以达到高C2产品（乙烷和乙烯）产量，商业化的最低要求为至少30%，但大多数催化系统难以达到这一标准。由于甲烷或C2产品的COx副产物形成，导致产量受限。抑制甲烷或C2产品中CO2和CO的形成是提高C2产量的关键。

2. 通过控制反应条件下活性氧化物种类型，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）解决了这些难题，提供了更高效的丙烯生产方式。通过调整活性氧化物种，ODHP寻求提高选择性和效率。使用替代氧化剂在ODHP中的应用是一个可行策略，考虑到催化剂依赖性动力学因素和氧化剂激活对反应机制的影响。

3. 将N2O用作氧化剂在ODHP中提供了一些优势，包括可能增强C2选择性，由于其温和的氧化性质。与O2不同，N2O仅提供单原子氧物种（如O-·），降低了过氧化的风险。这可能导致更高的C2产量，超过许多O2-OCM系统。

4. CO2作为另一种替代氧化剂，在ODHP中具有独特优势。其内向热力学特性和与CH3基团在气相中不相互作用的特点使其成为合适的选择。CO2-OCM可以潜在地通过避免形成CO和CO2副产物来提高C2选择性，而这是O2-OCM所不具备的。热力学分析表明，在10-30%的温度范围内，实现ODHP中的显著CH4转化是可行的。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving high yields of C2 products, specifically ethane and ethylene, from methane. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane to propylene, bypassing the need for methane conversion, which can be more challenging. ODHP presents advantages in terms of potentially higher efficiency and lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods. However, it also comes with its own set of limitations, including the need for suitable catalysts and operating conditions to maximize propylene yield.

2. When selecting oxidants for propylene production, oxygen is commonly used due to its effectiveness in promoting the desired chemical reactions. Oxygen facilitates the dehydrogenation process by providing the necessary oxygen atoms to react with hydrocarbons. However, the use of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, resulting in the formation of unwanted byproducts such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. To mitigate these issues, alternative oxidants like nitrogen dioxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are considered. These alternatives offer a milder oxidizing environment, potentially reducing the formation of byproducts while still enabling efficient conversion of hydrocarbons to olefins. Each alternative oxidant has unique thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics that influence their effectiveness in propylene production.

3. The thermodynamic analyses suggest that the optimal temperature range for maximizing propylene yield through oxidative dehydrogenation reactions lies between 10% and 30% conversion of methane or propane. This range is crucial because it balances the need for sufficient reaction rates to convert feedstock effectively while minimizing the risk of overreacting and producing unwanted byproducts. Operating within this range ensures that the process is both economically viable and environmentally sustainable, contributing to more efficient and cleaner propylene production.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括从甲烷中高效获得C2产品，特别是乙烷和乙烯。通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，因为它绕过了需要更复杂的甲烷转化步骤，这通常更具挑战性。ODHP的优点在于可能具有更高的效率和更低的环境影响与传统方法相比。然而，它也带来了自己的局限性，包括需要合适的催化剂和操作条件来最大化丙烯产率。

2. 在选择用于丙烯生产的氧化剂时，通常使用氧气，因为它能够有效地促进所需化学反应。氧气通过提供必要的氧原子来与烃类反应，促进脱氢过程。然而，使用氧气可能导致过氧化，导致形成不期望的副产物，如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。为了减轻这些问题，考虑使用替代氧化剂，如氮氧化物（N2O）、二氧化碳（CO2）和二氧化硫（SO2）。这些替代品提供了较为温和的氧化环境，有可能减少副产品的生成，同时仍然允许有效转化烃类为烯烃。每种替代氧化剂都有独特的热力学和动力学特性，影响其在丙烯生产中的有效性。

3. 热力学分析表明，通过氧化脱氢反应最大化丙烯产率的理想温度范围为10%至30%的甲烷或丙烷转化。这个范围至关重要，因为它平衡了足够快的反应速率以有效转化原料的需求，同时尽量减少过度反应和产生不期望副产品的风险。在这个范围内运行确保了过程既经济可行又环境可持续，对更高效的清洁丙烯生产做出了贡献。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high cost and complexity of traditional processes, the need for significant energy input, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly method. It presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP allows for direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for intermediate hydrogenation steps. However, the use of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, producing unwanted byproducts like CO and CO2. In contrast, alternative oxidants like nitrogen dioxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) offer milder oxidizing conditions, potentially reducing the formation of byproducts and improving selectivity for propylene. Each of these alternative oxidants has unique thermodynamic characteristics that influence their effectiveness in ODHP, requiring careful selection based on the desired product distribution and efficiency.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the difficulty in achieving high yields of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) and the formation of COx byproducts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more selective and efficient method for propylene production, especially when using alternative oxidants like N2O. N2O's mild oxidizing tendency and ability to form monoatomic oxygen species can lead to enhanced C2 selectivity. Moreover, N2O's decomposition on the catalyst surface releases N2 gas and forms surface oxygen sites, which can be crucial for selective C2 formation.

2. When considering alternative oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O presents several advantages. It can improve selectivity by decreasing the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation processes and forming more selective active oxygen species. N2O can also lead to a wider range of oxidant/CH4 ratios without the risk of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion, as seen with oxygen. Catalysts for N2O-OCM often include irreducible, basic, or rare earth metal oxides, which can lead to reduced methane conversions but improved C2 selectivities compared to oxygen. The use of N2O has been shown to achieve significantly higher C2 selectivities even at similar methane conversion levels.

3. N2O's role in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is multifaceted. It can activate methane through the formation of monoatomic oxygen species (O-·), which are responsible for selective C2 formation. N2O's decomposition on the catalyst surface releases N2 gas and forms surface oxygen sites, contributing to the observed higher C2 selectivity. The decomposition pathways of N2O can be differentiated based on the catalyst's behavior in the presence of O2 during the reaction. N2O-OCM reactions have provided insights into the role of N2O in activating methane and forming active oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst.

4. The use of alternative oxidants, such as N2O, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages. These include enhanced C2 selectivity, reduced methane conversion requirements, and a broader range of oxidant/CH4 ratios. The decomposition of N2O on the catalyst surface can lead to the formation of surface oxygen sites, which are crucial for selective C2 formation. The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O can be attributed to the preferential formation of these surface oxygen sites that catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals. The decomposition pathways of N2O and their effects on the reaction mechanisms have been extensively studied, highlighting the importance of catalyst surface conditions in N2O-OCM processes.

5. The use of N2O as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several benefits. It can lead to enhanced C2 selectivity and improved efficiency in propylene production.
