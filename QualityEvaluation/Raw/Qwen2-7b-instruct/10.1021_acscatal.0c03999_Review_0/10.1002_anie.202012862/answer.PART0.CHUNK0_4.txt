[1] "Despite the abundance of OCM research findings, achieving a high yield of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) remains a major challenge. It has been estimated that a C2 yield of at least 30% will be necessary for OCM commercialization, yet few catalytic systems are able to approach this benchmark."
[2] "The main limiting factor is the formation of the aforementioned COx byproducts."
[3] "Alternative oxidants may improve selectivity to desired products by decreasing the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation processes, forming more selective active oxygen species, or a combination of these factors."
[4] "Replacing O2 with other oxidants is one possible approach to achieve this goal."
[5] "Of course, catalyst- and reaction-dependent kinetic considerations relating to oxidant activation may also lead to mechanistic pathway differences when alternative oxidants are employed."
[6] "Utilizing N2O as an oxidant could conceivably lead to enhanced C2 selectivity in OCM due to its relatively mild oxidizing tendency compared to O2."
[7] "In particular, N2O can only provide a monoatomic oxygen species, such as O-·."
[8] "Furthermore, N2O decomposes on the catalyst surface, leading to the release of N2 gas and the formation of surface oxygen sites."
[9] "It has generally been observed in the OCM literature that monoatomic surface oxygen species (O*) are responsible for selective C2 formation, whereas molecular or gas phase oxygen species facilitate overoxidation."
[10] "In fact, it has been estimated that there is an upper limit of 28% single pass C2 yield for OCM in the presence of gas phase O2 under typical O2/CH4 cofeed conditions."
[11] "Additionally, the range of possible oxidant/CH4 ratios is far wider when using N2O, as there is no threat of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion as with O2."
[12] "Catalysts for N2O-OCM are frequently irreducible, basic, or rare earth metal oxides."
[13] "For most of these catalysts, the use of N2O leads to reduced methane conversions, but improved C2 selectivities versus O2 as the oxidant."
[14] "Even at approximately equal CH4 conversion levels, the C2 selectivity has been observed to be significantly higher using N2O than O2."
[15] "This trend can be visualized graphically in Figure 2."
[16] "The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O* sites, which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals."
[17] "Several reports using N2O as an oxidant also investigated the mechanism of N2O decomposition on the surface of metal oxide OCM catalysts."
[18] "Many of these studies attempted to differentiate between two possible N2O decomposition pathways."
[19] "In Pathway 1, N2O is activated at a coordination-unsaturated cation to form N2 gas and an O* species."
[20] "In Pathway 2, N2O decomposes into N2 and O* over anion vacancies, and two O* species may come together to release molecular oxygen."
[21] "These pathways can be distinguished by measuring the effect of cofed O2 during N2O-OCM."
[22] "Kinetic measurements on N2O-OCM reactions have also provided insight into the role of N2O."
[23] "Interestingly, the authors observed that the catalysts are more active under N2O than under O2, contrary to most other systems."
[24] "Chlorine is also present in other effective N2O-OCM catalysts, such as KCl-LnCl3 molten salts."
[25] "The La catalyst displays stable 75% C2 selectivity at about 10% conversion for 48 hours, while the same catalyst only achieves 40% C2 selectivity with O2 at isoconversion."
[26] "In addition to traditional alkaline and rare earth-based oxides, a number of other catalyst systems have proven to be effective for N2O-OCM."
[27] "For example, Sugiyama examined hydroxyapatite catalysts for N2O-OCM and observed that the selectivity displays little to no dependence on the N2O partial pressure."
[28] "Many similarities can be drawn between O2 and N2O-OCM systems."
[29] "Research on both oxidants has predominantly focused on basic, alkaline earth, or rare earth oxides."
[30] "Surface basicity and oxygen content/lability are important factors affecting reactivity and selectivity for both systems."
[31] "Furthermore, the role of both O2 and N2O in replenishing/forming active oxygen species on the surface has been emphasized."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the difficulty in achieving high yields of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) and the formation of COx byproducts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more selective and efficient method for propylene production, especially when using alternative oxidants like N2O. N2O's mild oxidizing tendency and ability to form monoatomic oxygen species can lead to enhanced C2 selectivity. Moreover, N2O's decomposition on the catalyst surface releases N2 gas and forms surface oxygen sites, which can be crucial for selective C2 formation.

2. When considering alternative oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), N2O presents several advantages. It can improve selectivity by decreasing the thermodynamic driving force for overoxidation processes and forming more selective active oxygen species. N2O can also lead to a wider range of oxidant/CH4 ratios without the risk of explosion or runaway CH4 combustion, as seen with oxygen. Catalysts for N2O-OCM often include irreducible, basic, or rare earth metal oxides, which can lead to reduced methane conversions but improved C2 selectivities compared to oxygen. The use of N2O has been shown to achieve significantly higher C2 selectivities even at similar methane conversion levels.

3. N2O's role in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is multifaceted. It can activate methane through the formation of monoatomic oxygen species (O-·), which are responsible for selective C2 formation. N2O's decomposition on the catalyst surface releases N2 gas and forms surface oxygen sites, contributing to the observed higher C2 selectivity. The decomposition pathways of N2O can be differentiated based on the catalyst's behavior in the presence of O2 during the reaction. N2O-OCM reactions have provided insights into the role of N2O in activating methane and forming active oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst.

4. The use of alternative oxidants, such as N2O, in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages. These include enhanced C2 selectivity, reduced methane conversion requirements, and a broader range of oxidant/CH4 ratios. The decomposition of N2O on the catalyst surface can lead to the formation of surface oxygen sites, which are crucial for selective C2 formation. The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O can be attributed to the preferential formation of these surface oxygen sites that catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals. The decomposition pathways of N2O and their effects on the reaction mechanisms have been extensively studied, highlighting the importance of catalyst surface conditions in N2O-OCM processes.

5. The use of N2O as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several benefits. It can lead to enhanced C2 selectivity and improved efficiency in propylene production. N2O's ability to form monoatomic oxygen species (O-·) and its decomposition on the catalyst surface releasing N2 gas and forming surface oxygen sites contribute to selective C2 formation. The decomposition pathways of N2O can be differentiated based on the catalyst's behavior in the presence of O2, and kinetic measurements have provided insights into the role of N2O in the activation of methane. The higher C2 selectivity with N2O can be attributed to the formation of more selective active oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst.
