[1] "Despite the abundance of OCM research findings, achieving a high yield of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) remains a major challenge."
[2] "It has been estimated that a C2 yield of at least 30% will be necessary for OCM commercialization, yet few catalytic systems are able to approach this benchmark."
[3] "The main limiting factor is the formation of the aforementioned COx byproducts."
[4] "One conceivable strategy to enhance OCM selectivity is to control the types of active oxidizing species that are present under reaction conditions."
[5] "In fact, substituting O2 with less aggressive, softer oxidants such as CO2 or N2O has been a frequent strategy for light alkane partial oxidations."
[6] "The literature reports for each different alternative oxidant for X-OCM systems tend to highlight very different aspects of the catalytic reaction."
[7] "For most of these catalysts, the use of N2O leads to reduced methane conversions, but improved C2 selectivities versus O2 as the oxidant."
[8] "Even at approximately equal CH4 conversion levels, the C2 selectivity has been observed to be significantly higher using N2O than O2."
[9] "The observed higher C2 selectivity with N2O has been attributed to the preferential formation of surface O or O* sites, which catalyze the formation of ·CH3 radicals."
[10] "The role of both O2 and N2O in replenishing/forming active oxygen species on the surface has been emphasized."
[11] "However, the nature of these active species may differ."
[12] "While O2 can form peroxo species that act as COx precursors, N2O can only initially form monoatomic O or O* species and does not cause gas phase combustion reactions."
[13] "This catalyst achieved a remarkable 30.7% C2 yield (66.8% CH4 conversion, 46% C2 selectivity)."
[14] "Several catalysts achieve C2 yields greater than 10%, which is greater than or on par with numerous O2-OCM systems."
[15] "The higher C2 selectivity with N2O as an oxidant in turn has afforded promising yields."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), include achieving a high yield of C2 products (ethane and ethylene) and managing the formation of COx byproducts. ODHP addresses these issues by potentially offering higher C2 selectivity and reducing the need for additional dehydrogenation steps. By selecting less aggressive oxidants like CO2 or N2O, the risk of overoxidation is minimized, enhancing product selectivity and efficiency. The use of alternative oxidants allows for better control over the types of active oxidizing species present, leading to improved selectivity of desired C2 products. In the context of N2O as an oxidant, it is noted for its mild oxidizing tendency, which facilitates selective C2 formation through the preferential formation of surface O or O* sites, avoiding the formation of peroxo or gas-phase oxygen species that lead to overoxidation. This results in a higher C2 selectivity compared to using oxygen, yielding promising results in terms of C2 product yield. The advantage of using CO2 as an oxidant lies in its ability to improve C2 selectivity due to its monoatomic oxygen delivery and the absence of interaction with ·CH3 radicals in the gas phase, thereby shifting the equilibrium towards more valuable products.

在当前丙烯生产方法中，主要挑战包括实现C2产品（乙烷和乙烯）的高产率以及管理COx副产品的形成。通过氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP），可以解决这些问题并提供更高的C2选择性和减少额外脱氢步骤的需求。通过选择较不激进的氧化剂如CO2或N2O，可以降低过氧化的风险，从而提高产物选择性与效率。选择替代氧化剂允许更好地控制活性氧化物种的类型，从而提高所需C2产物的选择性。关于使用N2O作为氧化剂，它因其温和的氧化倾向而被注意到，这使得通过优先形成表面O或O*位点促进C2形成，避免形成过氧化物或气相氧物种导致过氧化。这导致与使用氧气相比具有更高C2选择性，产生有前景的C2产量结果。使用CO2作为氧化剂的优势在于其仅提供单原子氧输送的能力，并且不会与·CH3自由基在气相中发生反应，从而将平衡向更宝贵的产物方向移动。
