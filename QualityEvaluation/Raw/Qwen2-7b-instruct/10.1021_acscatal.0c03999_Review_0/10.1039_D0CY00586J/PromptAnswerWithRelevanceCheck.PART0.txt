[1] "Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and fastest growing in demand petrochemicals."
[2] "Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."
[3] "Vast availability of low molecular weight alkanes due to the recent shale gas revolution is considered as a game-changing opportunity towards the potential development of on-purpose production processes."
[4] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere."
[5] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
[6] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[7] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[8] "Although promising initial propylene yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high temperatures required for direct dehydrogenation (DH) and the potential for deep oxidation and coke formation in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). Propane ODH offers a way to potentially lower reaction temperatures but faces difficulties in controlling the fate of desired propylene due to combustion and the formation of undesired products. Using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODH can mitigate issues related to deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, catalysts based on chromium (Cr) suffer from severe and rapid deactivation. Research by JG Chen's group has provided insights into light alkane CO2-assisted ODH over non-precious metals like iron-nickel (Fe-Ni) and precious metals like iron-palladium (Fe-Pt) and nickel-palladium (Ni-Pt) over ceria (CeO2), which could potentially enhance stability and catalytic performance in propane ODH.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括直接脱氢（DH）所需的高温和氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中可能出现的深度氧化和焦炭形成。在ODH中使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂可以降低反应温度，但难以控制目标丙烯的命运，因为丙烷和丙烯可能会燃烧生成碳氧化物和/或二氧化碳，从而显著降低丙烯的选择性。使用二氧化碳作为替代氧气的软氧化剂具有以下潜力：i）避免烷烃/烯烃的深度氧化，ii）减少焦炭形成和iii）通过参与逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）促进丙烷转化。然而，基于铬（Cr）的催化剂在短时间内会经历严重的快速失活，无论样品制备、反应条件和反应器设计如何。JG Chen研究组的工作提供了对轻质烷烃CO2辅助ODH在非贵金属（铁镍（Fe-Ni））和贵金属（铁钯（Fe-Pt）、镍钯（Ni-Pt））上的分子级理解，以及在氧化铈（CeO2）上，这可能有助于提高稳定性和丙烷ODH的催化性能。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, including fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, are the high cost and environmental concerns related to the toxicity of chromium-based catalysts in FCC and the high operating temperature and cost of platinum catalysts in steam cracking. Additionally, these methods face bottlenecks in catalyst stability and deactivation. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) presents an advantage in reducing the reaction temperature due to the exothermic nature of the process, but it suffers from issues like uncontrollable propylene yield and selectivity, often leading to the combustion of propane and propylene. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant in ODH offers benefits such as avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reducing coke formation, and favoring propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, the challenge lies in the lack of catalysts that maintain high activity and promising olefin selectivity, hindering large-scale commercialization. Introducing iron into ceria lattice through a series of Fe/Ce molar ratios aims to enhance the stability and performance of the catalyst for propane ODH.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the toxicity of chromium-based catalysts, high operating temperatures for Pt/Sn catalytic systems, and the spatial separation of Pt-Sn species, leading to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature and avoiding the formation of chromium compounds, thereby minimizing toxicity. However, ODHP faces its own set of challenges, including the difficulty in controlling the fate of desired propylene due to the overoxidation of parafins and olefins, and the lack of suitable catalysts that exhibit high activity while maintaining promising olefin selectivity.

2. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages. It avoids deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reduces coke formation, and facilitates propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Yet, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions, and reactor design, presents a significant challenge.

3. Fe doped ceria catalysts have been reported to show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for ODHP using CO2 as the oxidant. The introduction of Fe3+ into the ceria lattice, which is known to be active for propane dehydrogenation and CO2 activation, contributes to the formation of stable surface active sites on the catalyst. This enhances the catalytic performance and stability of the ODHP process.

4. Ceria-based catalysts possess excellent oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC), which forms the foundation for this study. By incorporating Fe3+ into the ceria lattice, researchers aim to utilize the well-known properties of cerium oxide materials to improve the synthesis of stable catalytic systems for ODHP.

5. The experimental setup for evaluating the catalytic activity involved a fixed bed quartz tube reactor packed with the catalyst and diluent. The reactor was fed with a mixture of propane, CO2, and nitrogen, and the outlet stream was analyzed using a microGC equipped with specific columns to determine the conversion, selectivity, and yield of the main products and by-products.

2. 碳二酸（CO2）作为ODHP中的氧化剂提供了一系列优势。它避免了深度氧化烷烃/烯烃，减少了焦炭的形成，并通过参与逆向水-气转移反应促进了丙烷的转化。然而，Cr基催化剂在短时间内严重且快速失活，无论样品制备、反应条件还是反应器设计如何，这构成了一个重大挑战。

3. 报告的Fe掺杂铈催化剂显示了增强的稳定性和ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂的有前景的催化性能。将Fe3+引入铈晶格中，这已被证明对丙烷脱氢和CO2激活具有活性，有助于在催化剂上形成稳定的表面活性位点。这增强了ODHP过程的催化性能和稳定性。

4. 铈基催化剂表现出卓越的氧移动性和氧存储能力(OSC)，这是本研究的基础。通过将Fe3+引入铈晶格中，研究人员旨在利用铈氧化物材料的已知特性，改进合成稳定催化系统以促进ODHP。

5. 评估催化活性的实验设置涉及填充催化剂和稀释剂的固定床石英管反应器。反应器被丙烷、CO2和氮气的混合物喂料，并通过带有特定柱子的在线微GC分析出口流，以确定主要产品的转化率、选择性和副产品的产率。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, including fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, are the limited supply-demand balance and the environmental impact due to the use of toxic chromium-based catalysts in FCC processes. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing reaction temperatures and minimizing the use of harmful catalysts. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Its advantages include lower operating temperatures and the potential to utilize a softer oxidant like CO2, which reduces the risk of deep oxidation and coke formation. Limitations include the difficulty in controlling the fate of the desired propylene, which may lead to lower selectivity due to combustion reactions.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers several benefits: avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reducing coke formation, and favoring propane conversion by utilizing produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Despite these advantages, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation, primarily due to coke deposition, catalyst structure collapse, and the re-oxidation of reduced Cr species. In contrast, Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts demonstrate enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, making them a viable alternative in the pursuit of sustainable propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是供需平衡有限以及FCC过程中使用有毒铬基催化剂导致的环境影响。通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，因为它有可能降低反应温度并减少有害催化剂的使用。然而，ODHP也有其优势和限制。其优势包括较低的操作温度和利用较软的氧化剂CO2，这可以降低深度氧化的风险和焦炭形成。限制在于控制所需丙烯的最终命运困难，可能导致选择性降低，因为可能会发生燃烧反应。

将CO2用作ODHP中的氧化剂提供了几个好处：避免深氧化烷烃/烯烃、减少焦炭形成，并通过利用产生的氢气参与逆向水煤气变换反应来促进丙烷转化。尽管存在这些优势，基于Cr的催化剂在短时间内会经历严重的快速失活，主要原因是焦炭沉积、催化剂结构崩溃和还原Cr物种的重新氧化。相比之下，Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中表现出增强的稳定性和有前景的催化性能，使其成为可持续丙烯生产的可行替代方案。
