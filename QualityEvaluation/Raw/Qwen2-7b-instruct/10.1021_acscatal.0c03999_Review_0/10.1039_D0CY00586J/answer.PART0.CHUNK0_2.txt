[1] "The competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide."
[2] "With CO2 being a soft oxidant, it was found that reduced Cr species can be partially re-oxidized to higher oxidative states."
[3] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[4] "Although promising initial propylene yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design."
[5] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant."
[6] "The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria-based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the toxicity of chromium-based catalysts, high operating temperatures for Pt/Sn catalytic systems, and the spatial separation of Pt-Sn species, leading to catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing the reaction temperature and avoiding the formation of chromium compounds, thereby minimizing toxicity. However, ODHP faces its own set of challenges, including the difficulty in controlling the fate of desired propylene due to the overoxidation of parafins and olefins, and the lack of suitable catalysts that exhibit high activity while maintaining promising olefin selectivity.

2. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP offers several advantages. It avoids deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reduces coke formation, and facilitates propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Yet, the deactivation of Cr-based catalysts within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions, and reactor design, presents a significant challenge.

3. Fe doped ceria catalysts have been reported to show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for ODHP using CO2 as the oxidant. The introduction of Fe3+ into the ceria lattice, which is known to be active for propane dehydrogenation and CO2 activation, contributes to the formation of stable surface active sites on the catalyst. This enhances the catalytic performance and stability of the ODHP process.

4. Ceria-based catalysts possess excellent oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC), which forms the foundation for this study. By incorporating Fe3+ into the ceria lattice, researchers aim to utilize the well-known properties of cerium oxide materials to improve the synthesis of stable catalytic systems for ODHP.

5. The experimental setup for evaluating the catalytic activity involved a fixed bed quartz tube reactor packed with the catalyst and diluent. The reactor was fed with a mixture of propane, CO2, and nitrogen, and the outlet stream was analyzed using a microGC equipped with specific columns to determine the conversion, selectivity, and yield of the main products and by-products.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括铬基催化剂的毒性、铂/锡催化系统的高操作温度以及Pt-Sn物种的空间分离，导致催化剂失活。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过可能降低反应温度并避免形成铬化合物，从而减少毒性来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP面临自身的挑战，即由于烷烃/烯烃的过氧化和烯烃的过氧化，难以控制所需丙烯的命运。

2. 碳二酸（CO2）作为ODHP中的氧化剂提供了一系列优势。它避免了深度氧化烷烃/烯烃，减少了焦炭的形成，并通过参与逆向水-气转移反应促进了丙烷的转化。然而，Cr基催化剂在短时间内严重且快速失活，无论样品制备、反应条件还是反应器设计如何，这构成了一个重大挑战。

3. 报告的Fe掺杂铈催化剂显示了增强的稳定性和ODHP中使用CO2作为氧化剂的有前景的催化性能。将Fe3+引入铈晶格中，这已被证明对丙烷脱氢和CO2激活具有活性，有助于在催化剂上形成稳定的表面活性位点。这增强了ODHP过程的催化性能和稳定性。

4. 铈基催化剂表现出卓越的氧移动性和氧存储能力(OSC)，这是本研究的基础。通过将Fe3+引入铈晶格中，研究人员旨在利用铈氧化物材料的已知特性，改进合成稳定催化系统以促进ODHP。

5. 评估催化活性的实验设置涉及填充催化剂和稀释剂的固定床石英管反应器。反应器被丙烷、CO2和氮气的混合物喂料，并通过带有特定柱子的在线微GC分析出口流，以确定主要产品的转化率、选择性和副产品的产率。
