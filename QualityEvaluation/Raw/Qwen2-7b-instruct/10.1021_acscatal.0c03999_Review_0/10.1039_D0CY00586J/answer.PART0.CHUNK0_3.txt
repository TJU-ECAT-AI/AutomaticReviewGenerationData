1. Current propylene production methods, including fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, face significant challenges in maximizing propylene production due to the substantial gap between supply and demand. The recent shale gas revolution has provided an opportunity for developing more purposeful production processes due to the abundance of low molecular weight alkanes.

2. Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are techniques that have gained interest in the academic and industrial sectors. However, they both encounter limitations, as detailed in other literature reviews.

3. Using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an alternative oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation presents several benefits, including avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reducing coke formation, and enhancing propane conversion through participation in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).

4. In this study, a series of iron (Fe)-doped ceria (CeO2) catalysts were developed for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2. These catalysts demonstrated improved stability and promising catalytic performance.

5. Ceria-based catalysts are known for their high oxygen mobility and storage capacity (OSC), which serve as the foundation for forming stable surface active sites in this research.

6. Iron (Fe) was incorporated into the ceria lattice through a range of Fe/Ce molar ratios, leveraging its proven activity in propane dehydrogenation and CO2 activation.

7. The catalytic performance of these Fe-doped ceria catalysts was assessed using a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor packed with the catalyst and sand.

8. The analysis of the reaction output was carried out using an inline microGC (Agilent 490) equipped with columns for various gases, including methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2), ethene (C2H4), ethane (C2H6), propene (C3H6), and propane (C3H8).
