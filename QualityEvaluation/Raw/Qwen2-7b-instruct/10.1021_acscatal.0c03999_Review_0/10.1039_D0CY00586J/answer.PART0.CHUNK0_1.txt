[1] "Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."
[2] "Vast availability of low molecular weight alkanes due to the recent shale gas revolution is considered as a game- changing opportunity towards the potential development of on-purpose production processes."
[3] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere1-3."
[4] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
[5] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[6] "Even though there is very rich literature on various catalytic systems (e.g. metals, transition metal oxides, rare-earth metal oxides,metal carbides, supported alkali oxides and supported alkali chlorides), the lack of suitable catalysts that exhibit high activity while maintaining promising olefin selectivity is hampering potential endeavors for large scale commercializing."
[7] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water- gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[8] "The aforementioned competitive reaction network due to the overoxidation of parafins and/or olefins can be suppressed by replacing oxygen with a weak oxidant, such as carbon dioxide."
[9] "The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites."
[10] "Fe3+, which is proved to be active for propane dehydrogenation, was introduced into ceria lattice with a series of Fe/Ce molar ratios."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, including fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, are the high cost and environmental concerns related to the toxicity of chromium-based catalysts in FCC and the high operating temperature and cost of platinum catalysts in steam cracking. Additionally, these methods face bottlenecks in catalyst stability and deactivation. Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) presents an advantage in reducing the reaction temperature due to the exothermic nature of the process, but it suffers from issues like uncontrollable propylene yield and selectivity, often leading to the combustion of propane and propylene. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant in ODH offers benefits such as avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reducing coke formation, and favoring propane conversion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, the challenge lies in the lack of catalysts that maintain high activity and promising olefin selectivity, hindering large-scale commercialization. Introducing iron into ceria lattice through a series of Fe/Ce molar ratios aims to enhance the stability and performance of the catalyst for propane ODH.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括流化床催化裂化（FCC）和蒸汽裂解过程的成本问题和环境担忧，尤其是铬基催化剂在FCC中的毒性以及铂族催化剂在蒸汽裂解中的高成本。此外，这些方法在催化剂稳定性方面存在瓶颈。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的优势在于通过其放热特性降低反应温度，但存在控制丙烯产率和选择性的问题，导致丙烷和丙烯的燃烧，从而显著降低丙烯选择性。使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂在ODH中提供了优势，如避免深度氧化烷烃/烯烃、减少焦炭形成以及通过逆水煤气变换反应促进丙烷转化。然而，缺乏既能保持高活性又能维持良好烯烃选择性的催化剂阻碍了大规模商业化应用。通过一系列Fe/Ce摩尔比将铁引入铈晶格旨在提高催化剂的稳定性和性能，以促进丙烷ODH。
