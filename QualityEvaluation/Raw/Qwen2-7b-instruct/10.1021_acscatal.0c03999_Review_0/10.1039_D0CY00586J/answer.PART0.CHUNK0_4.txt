[1] "Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."

[4] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[5] "With CO2 being a soft oxidant,it was found that reduced Cr species can be partially re-oxidized to higher oxidative states. Although promising initial propylene yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design."
[6] "In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, including fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, are the limited supply-demand balance and the environmental impact due to the use of toxic chromium-based catalysts in FCC processes. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing reaction temperatures and minimizing the use of harmful catalysts. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Its advantages include lower operating temperatures and the potential to utilize a softer oxidant like CO2, which reduces the risk of deep oxidation and coke formation. Limitations include the difficulty in controlling the fate of the desired propylene, which may lead to lower selectivity due to combustion reactions.

Using CO2 as an oxidant in ODHP offers several benefits: avoiding deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, reducing coke formation, and favoring propane conversion by utilizing produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Despite these advantages, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation, primarily due to coke deposition, catalyst structure collapse, and the re-oxidation of reduced Cr species. In contrast, Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts demonstrate enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, making them a viable alternative in the pursuit of sustainable propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是供需平衡有限以及FCC过程中使用有毒铬基催化剂导致的环境影响。通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，因为它有可能降低反应温度并减少有害催化剂的使用。然而，ODHP也有其优势和限制。其优势包括较低的操作温度和利用较软的氧化剂CO2，这可以降低深度氧化的风险和焦炭形成。限制在于控制所需丙烯的最终命运困难，可能导致选择性降低，因为可能会发生燃烧反应。

将CO2用作ODHP中的氧化剂提供了几个好处：避免深氧化烷烃/烯烃、减少焦炭形成，并通过利用产生的氢气参与逆向水煤气变换反应来促进丙烷转化。尽管存在这些优势，基于Cr的催化剂在短时间内会经历严重的快速失活，主要原因是焦炭沉积、催化剂结构崩溃和还原Cr物种的重新氧化。相比之下，Fe掺杂CeO2催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中表现出增强的稳定性和有前景的催化性能，使其成为可持续丙烯生产的可行替代方案。
