[1] "Propylene is undoubtedly among the most important and fastest growing in demand petrochemicals."
[2] "Although fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) as well as steam cracking processes are still widely utilized, research efforts have been placed in developing new technologies that maximize propylene production while addressing the big gap between supply and demand."
[3] "Vast availability of low molecular weight alkanes due to the recent shale gas revolution is considered as a game-changing opportunity towards the potential development of on-purpose production processes."
[4] "Propane direct dehydrogenation (DH) as well as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) have attracted worldwide academic and industrial interests, but both suffer from limitations that have been reviewed extensively elsewhere."
[5] "Propane DH is an endothermic reaction and thus high temperatures are required to achieve acceptable olefin yields."
[6] "On the other hand, although the exothermic character of propane ODH with O2 has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, the fate of the desired propylene is difficult to be controlled due to unavoidable combustion of propane as well as of propylene to carbon monoxide and/or dioxide thus significantly lowering propylene selectivity."
[7] "The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS)."
[8] "Although promising initial propylene yield was achieved, Cr-based catalysts suffer from severe and rapid deactivation within a short time, regardless of sample preparation, reaction conditions and reactor design."
[9] "Pioneering work by the research group of JG Chen has provided molecular level understanding on light alkane CO2 assisted ODH over non-precious metal (Fe-Ni) and precious metal (Fe-Pt, Ni-Pt) over CeO2."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high temperatures required for direct dehydrogenation (DH) and the potential for deep oxidation and coke formation in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). Propane ODH offers a way to potentially lower reaction temperatures but faces difficulties in controlling the fate of desired propylene due to combustion and the formation of undesired products. Using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODH can mitigate issues related to deep oxidation, reduce coke formation, and favor propane conversion by participating in the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, catalysts based on chromium (Cr) suffer from severe and rapid deactivation. Research by JG Chen's group has provided insights into light alkane CO2-assisted ODH over non-precious metals like iron-nickel (Fe-Ni) and precious metals like iron-palladium (Fe-Pt) and nickel-palladium (Ni-Pt) over ceria (CeO2), which could potentially enhance stability and catalytic performance in propane ODH.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括直接脱氢（DH）所需的高温和氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中可能出现的深度氧化和焦炭形成。在ODH中使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂可以降低反应温度，但难以控制目标丙烯的命运，因为丙烷和丙烯可能会燃烧生成碳氧化物和/或二氧化碳，从而显著降低丙烯的选择性。使用二氧化碳作为替代氧气的软氧化剂具有以下潜力：i）避免烷烃/烯烃的深度氧化，ii）减少焦炭形成和iii）通过参与逆向水煤气变换反应（RWGS）促进丙烷转化。然而，基于铬（Cr）的催化剂在短时间内会经历严重的快速失活，无论样品制备、反应条件和反应器设计如何。JG Chen研究组的工作提供了对轻质烷烃CO2辅助ODH在非贵金属（铁镍（Fe-Ni））和贵金属（铁钯（Fe-Pt）、镍钯（Ni-Pt））上的分子级理解，以及在氧化铈（CeO2）上，这可能有助于提高稳定性和丙烷ODH的催化性能。
