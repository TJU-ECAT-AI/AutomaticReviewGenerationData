The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations. Steam is used to control the reaction temperature, enhancing the selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen presents an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction. Carbon dioxide acts as a coke removing agent. However, undesired side reactions such as dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas and propane decomposition can lead to coke formation. The choice of catalyst and operating conditions can favor different combinations of reactions, leading to various sets of equilibria. Thermodynamic analysis of possible reactions is crucial for designing suitable catalysts for specific reactions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括每次通过的转化率低和产量低，这是由于平衡限制。蒸汽用于控制反应温度，提高选择性。氧气氧化丙烯的脱氢具有吸引力，因为它是一个放热且不受热力学限制的反应。二氧化碳作为焦炭去除剂起作用。然而，在系统条件下，可能会发生许多不希望的副反应，如丙烷重整为合成气和丙烷分解，这会导致焦炭形成。催化剂和操作条件的选择可以促进不同反应组合的使用，从而导致各种平衡状态。可能反应的热力学分析对于设计特定反应的合适催化剂至关重要。
