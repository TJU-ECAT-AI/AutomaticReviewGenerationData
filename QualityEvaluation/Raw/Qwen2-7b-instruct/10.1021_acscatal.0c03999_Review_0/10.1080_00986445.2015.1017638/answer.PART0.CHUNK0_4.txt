The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low conversion rates due to equilibrium limitations, undesirable side reactions that limit propylene yield, and the necessity for frequent catalyst regeneration due to coke formation. Steam helps control reaction temperature and improve selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane offers an attractive alternative as it is exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited. However, achieving high propylene selectivity remains a challenge due to overoxidation of propane. Soft oxidants like carbon dioxide can serve as potential alternatives. Carbon dioxide acts as a coke remover, but undesired side reactions like dry reforming and propane decomposition can occur. Coke formation, often due to carbon dioxide disproportionation and carbon monoxide reduction by hydrogen, leads to rapid catalyst deactivation. The choice of catalyst formulation and operating conditions can favor different reactions, leading to varying equilibria. Thermodynamic analysis is crucial for designing suitable catalysts for specific reactions, guiding experimental and computational studies, and understanding the constraints imposed by thermodynamics on process and catalyst development.
