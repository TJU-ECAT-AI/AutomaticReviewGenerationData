The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations in direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Steam is used to control reaction temperatures, enhancing selectivity. While catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen presents as an attractive alternative due to its exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited nature, achieving high propylene selectivity remains an unsolved problem due to overoxidation of propane. Soft oxidants like carbon dioxide are suggested as potential alternatives. CO2 acts as a coke removing agent, making it a nontraditional, mild oxidant and oxygen transfer agent. The promoting effect of CO2 can be attributed to its role in shifting the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction or its direct oxidation to propylene. Oxide catalysts, including those containing chromium (Cr) or gallium (Ga), have been found to be the most active and selective for propane dehydrogenation. However, depending on system conditions, undesired side reactions such as dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas can occur. In simulating catalytic systems, including nonredox and redox oxide catalysts, it was observed that the occurrence of dry reforming and coke-forming side reactions significantly impacts the equilibrium product composition. Experimental conversion levels of propane are much lower than equilibrium values, mainly due to rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation. This highlights the need for further research and development to formulate more active and selective catalysts to utilize the environmental benefits of using carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在直接催化脱氢化过程中每轮转化率低和产量低，这是由于热力学平衡的限制。蒸汽被用于控制反应温度，提高选择性。虽然氧气催化丙烯脱氢作为一种有吸引力的替代方案，因为它是一个放热且不受热力学限制的反应，但实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个未解决的问题，原因是在过氧化过程中对丙烯的过度氧化。软氧化剂如二氧化碳被视为潜在的替代品。二氧化碳作为焦炭去除剂的作用，使其成为非传统的温和氧化剂和氧传输剂。二氧化碳促进作用的解释是通过消耗水煤气转换反应（RWGS）中的氢气，将丙烯脱氢平衡推向完成，或者它直接参与丙烯氧化为丙烯。氧化物催化剂，特别是包含铬（Cr）或镓（Ga）的材料，已被发现是最活跃和选择性的丙烯脱氢催化剂。然而，根据系统条件的不同，可能会发生诸如丙烷干重整生成合成气体之类的不希望发生的副反应。在模拟催化系统时，包括非还原性和氧化性氧化物催化剂，发现丙烷干重整和焦炭形成副反应会显著影响多反应系统的平衡产物组成。实验中丙烷的转化率远低于平衡值，主要是由于焦炭形成导致催化剂快速失活。这强调了进一步研究和开发以形成更活跃和选择性催化剂的必要性，以利用使用二氧化碳在轻烷烃商业脱氢化过程中的环境优势。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as catalytic and steam cracking, include low conversion rates and limited yields due to equilibrium limitations. These processes do not meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is inefficient due to equilibrium limitations, and steam is used to control the reaction temperature, enhancing selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation, especially with oxygen, is an attractive alternative because it is exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited. However, the selectivity for propylene remains a challenge due to over-oxidation of propane. Carbon dioxide (CO2) presents as a potential alternative oxidant, acting as a coke removing agent. Its effect on propane dehydrogenation can be explained through the reverse water-gas shift reaction or direct oxidation of propane to propylene, depending on the system conditions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括催化和蒸汽裂解等过程的转化率低和产量有限，这些过程无法满足丙烯需求的增长。直接的烃类脱氢化由于平衡限制效率低下。蒸汽用于控制反应温度，提高选择性。氧气基氧化脱氢是一个有吸引力的替代方案，因为它是一个放热且非热力学受限反应。然而，丙烯的选择性仍然是一个难题，因为丙烯过度氧化。二氧化碳（CO2）作为潜在的替代氧化剂出现，它同时也是一个焦炭去除剂。其在丙烯脱氢中的作用可以解释为通过逆水煤气变换反应或丙烷直接氧化为丙烯，具体取决于系统条件。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low conversion rates due to equilibrium limitations, high temperatures required for commercially feasible conversions leading to undesirable side reactions like cracking and coke formation, and the lack of an efficient way to utilize the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane addresses these issues by offering a potentially exothermic, nonthermodynamically limited process. However, achieving high propylene selectivity remains a challenge due to overoxidation of propane. Carbon dioxide presents as a potential alternative oxidant for dehydrogenation, utilizing a greenhouse gas while also acting as a coke removing agent. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that equilibrium conversions in CO2PDH are higher than in the presence of inert gases or hydrogen. The rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation is a significant challenge in experimental setups, limiting accurate conversion measurements.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于平衡限制导致的低转化率，为了实现商业可行的转化温度过高，导致不希望的副反应如裂解和焦炭形成，以及缺乏有效利用温室气体二氧化碳的方法。氧化丙烷脱氢通过提供一个潜在的放热、非热力学限制的过程来解决这些问题。然而，由于过氧化导致的丙烯选择性问题仍然是一个难题。二氧化碳作为一种潜在的替代氧化剂出现，既可以利用温室气体，又可以作为焦炭去除剂。热力学分析表明，在二氧化碳PDH中的平衡转化率高于在惰性气体或氢气存在的条件下。催化剂快速由焦炭形成导致的失效是实验设置中准确测量转化率的主要挑战。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low conversion rates due to equilibrium limitations, undesirable side reactions that limit propylene yield, and the necessity for frequent catalyst regeneration due to coke formation. Steam helps control reaction temperature and improve selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane offers an attractive alternative as it is exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited. However, achieving high propylene selectivity remains a challenge due to overoxidation of propane. Soft oxidants like carbon dioxide can serve as potential alternatives. Carbon dioxide acts as a coke remover, but undesired side reactions like dry reforming and propane decomposition can occur. Coke formation, often due to carbon dioxide disproportionation and carbon monoxide reduction by hydrogen, leads to rapid catalyst deactivation. The choice of catalyst formulation and operating conditions can favor different reactions, leading to varying equilibria. Thermodynamic analysis is crucial for designing suitable catalysts for specific reactions, guiding experimental and computational studies, and understanding the constraints imposed by thermodynamics on process and catalyst development.
