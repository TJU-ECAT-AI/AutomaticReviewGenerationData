The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitations in direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Steam is used to control reaction temperatures, enhancing selectivity. While catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen presents as an attractive alternative due to its exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited nature, achieving high propylene selectivity remains an unsolved problem due to overoxidation of propane. Soft oxidants like carbon dioxide are suggested as potential alternatives. CO2 acts as a coke removing agent, making it a nontraditional, mild oxidant and oxygen transfer agent. The promoting effect of CO2 can be attributed to its role in shifting the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion through the reverse water-gas shift reaction or its direct oxidation to propylene. Oxide catalysts, including those containing chromium (Cr) or gallium (Ga), have been found to be the most active and selective for propane dehydrogenation. However, depending on system conditions, undesired side reactions such as dry reforming of propane to synthesis gas can occur. In simulating catalytic systems, including nonredox and redox oxide catalysts, it was observed that the occurrence of dry reforming and coke-forming side reactions significantly impacts the equilibrium product composition. Experimental conversion levels of propane are much lower than equilibrium values, mainly due to rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation. This highlights the need for further research and development to formulate more active and selective catalysts to utilize the environmental benefits of using carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在直接催化脱氢化过程中每轮转化率低和产量低，这是由于热力学平衡的限制。蒸汽被用于控制反应温度，提高选择性。虽然氧气催化丙烯脱氢作为一种有吸引力的替代方案，因为它是一个放热且不受热力学限制的反应，但实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个未解决的问题，原因是在过氧化过程中对丙烯的过度氧化。软氧化剂如二氧化碳被视为潜在的替代品。二氧化碳作为焦炭去除剂的作用，使其成为非传统的温和氧化剂和氧传输剂。二氧化碳促进作用的解释是通过消耗水煤气转换反应（RWGS）中的氢气，将丙烯脱氢平衡推向完成，或者它直接参与丙烯氧化为丙烯。氧化物催化剂，特别是包含铬（Cr）或镓（Ga）的材料，已被发现是最活跃和选择性的丙烯脱氢催化剂。然而，根据系统条件的不同，可能会发生诸如丙烷干重整生成合成气体之类的不希望发生的副反应。在模拟催化系统时，包括非还原性和氧化性氧化物催化剂，发现丙烷干重整和焦炭形成副反应会显著影响多反应系统的平衡产物组成。实验中丙烷的转化率远低于平衡值，主要是由于焦炭形成导致催化剂快速失活。这强调了进一步研究和开发以形成更活跃和选择性催化剂的必要性，以利用使用二氧化碳在轻烷烃商业脱氢化过程中的环境优势。
