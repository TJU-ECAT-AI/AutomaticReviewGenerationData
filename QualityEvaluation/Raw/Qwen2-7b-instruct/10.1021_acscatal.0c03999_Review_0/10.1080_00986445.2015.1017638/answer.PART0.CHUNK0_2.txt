[1] "Propylene is an important raw material in the production of polypropylene, polyacrylonitrile, acrolein, and acrylic acid."
[2] "The conventional manufacturing methods such as catalytic and steam cracking which produce propylene as a byproduct do not meet the ever-increasing demand."
[3] "Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is characterized by low conversion per pass and low yields due to equilibrium limitation."
[4] "Steam controls the reaction temperature, serving as a heat sink and enhancing the selectivity."
[5] "By removing the hydrogen in the form of water from reaction 1, oxidative dehydrogenation proceeds to a greater extent than simple catalytic dehydrogenation."
[6] "Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by oxygen is an attractive alternative because it is an exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited reaction."
[7] "However, the propylene selectivity of the reaction remains an unsolved problem owing to the over-oxidation of propane."
[8] "On the other hand, soft oxidants such as carbon dioxide appear as potential alternatives."
[9] "CO2 is a coke removing agent as well."
[10] "The promoting effect of CO2 is explained either by consumption of the hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS), which shifts the equilibrium of propane dehydrogenation to completion (two-step pathway) or its participation in direct oxidation of propane to propylene (one-step pathway)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as catalytic and steam cracking, include low conversion rates and limited yields due to equilibrium limitations. These processes do not meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene. Direct catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is inefficient due to equilibrium limitations, and steam is used to control the reaction temperature, enhancing selectivity. Oxidative dehydrogenation, especially with oxygen, is an attractive alternative because it is exothermic and nonthermodynamically limited. However, the selectivity for propylene remains a challenge due to over-oxidation of propane. Carbon dioxide (CO2) presents as a potential alternative oxidant, acting as a coke removing agent. Its effect on propane dehydrogenation can be explained through the reverse water-gas shift reaction or direct oxidation of propane to propylene, depending on the system conditions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括催化和蒸汽裂解等过程的转化率低和产量有限，这些过程无法满足丙烯需求的增长。直接的烃类脱氢化由于平衡限制效率低下。蒸汽用于控制反应温度，提高选择性。氧气基氧化脱氢是一个有吸引力的替代方案，因为它是一个放热且非热力学受限反应。然而，丙烯的选择性仍然是一个难题，因为丙烯过度氧化。二氧化碳（CO2）作为潜在的替代氧化剂出现，它同时也是一个焦炭去除剂。其在丙烯脱氢中的作用可以解释为通过逆水煤气变换反应或丙烷直接氧化为丙烯，具体取决于系统条件。
