The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low conversion rates due to equilibrium limitations, high temperatures required for commercially feasible conversions leading to undesirable side reactions like cracking and coke formation, and the lack of an efficient way to utilize the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane addresses these issues by offering a potentially exothermic, nonthermodynamically limited process. However, achieving high propylene selectivity remains a challenge due to overoxidation of propane. Carbon dioxide presents as a potential alternative oxidant for dehydrogenation, utilizing a greenhouse gas while also acting as a coke removing agent. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that equilibrium conversions in CO2PDH are higher than in the presence of inert gases or hydrogen. The rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation is a significant challenge in experimental setups, limiting accurate conversion measurements.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于平衡限制导致的低转化率，为了实现商业可行的转化温度过高，导致不希望的副反应如裂解和焦炭形成，以及缺乏有效利用温室气体二氧化碳的方法。氧化丙烷脱氢通过提供一个潜在的放热、非热力学限制的过程来解决这些问题。然而，由于过氧化导致的丙烯选择性问题仍然是一个难题。二氧化碳作为一种潜在的替代氧化剂出现，既可以利用温室气体，又可以作为焦炭去除剂。热力学分析表明，在二氧化碳PDH中的平衡转化率高于在惰性气体或氢气存在的条件下。催化剂快速由焦炭形成导致的失效是实验设置中准确测量转化率的主要挑战。
