[1] "The combined surface and gas-phase reaction network reported herein provides a sound mechanistic framework for future studies of boron-containing materials."
[2] "We argue that the remarkable product distribution can be rationalized by a combination of surface-mediated formation of radicals over metastable sites, and their sequential propagation in the gas phase."
[3] "The addition of water enhances the rates of pathways already present under standard conditions."
[4] "For a given set of reaction conditions, there is a volcano-type dependence of the reaction rate on catalyst mass, suggesting a balance between surface-derived radical generation and termination events."
[5] "This model suggests that, under ODH conditions, there may be a mix of surface and gas-phase propane H abstraction, leading to an approximately equimolar amount of i- and n-propyl radicals being formed."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and selectivity issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method for propylene production. It utilizes oxygen as the oxidant, which is abundant and relatively inexpensive. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One advantage is the ability to selectively produce propylene, reducing the formation of by-products like ethylene. Yet, selecting the appropriate oxidant, such as oxygen, is crucial as it affects the reaction kinetics and product distribution. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include maintaining a high yield of propylene while minimizing the formation of unwanted by-products. The literature demonstrates that the use of oxygen in ODHP allows for the formation of a variety of boron species, contributing to the complex reaction network that results in high propylene selectivity. This process involves surface-initiated radical reactions that propagate via gas-phase chemistry, offering a mechanism that contrasts with traditional vanadium-based catalysts, which rely on surface reactions and exhibit lower selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境问题和选择性问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能和环保的丙烯生产方式来解决这些问题。它利用氧气作为氧化剂，氧气丰富且成本相对较低。然而，ODHP也存在优势和限制。优势之一是能够选择性地生成丙烯，减少副产物如乙烯的形成。使用氧气的具体挑战包括在保持高丙烯产率的同时，尽量减少副产品的生成。文献表明，在ODHP中使用氧气允许形成多种硼物种，这导致了复杂的反应网络，从而实现了高丙烯选择性。这一过程涉及表面引发的自由基反应，这些反应通过气相化学传播，与基于钒的传统催化剂机制形成鲜明对比，后者依赖于表面反应并表现出较低的选择性。
