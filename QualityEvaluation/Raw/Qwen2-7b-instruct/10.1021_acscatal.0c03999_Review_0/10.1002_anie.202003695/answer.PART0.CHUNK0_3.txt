[1] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavage—the most important side-reaction—is controlled by the oxygen concentration."
[2] "To complement these observed activity improvements with wet ODH feeds, we varied water concentrations between 120mol% under two propane concentrations (15 and 25mol%; Supporting Information, FigureS1)."
[3] "This nonlinear dependence can be explained within the context of a mixed surface-gas-phase mechanism. When using MgO-based catalysts, Leveles et al. hypothesized that the gas-phase contribution to propane conversion can be neglected at low alkane concentrations, relative to surface reactions."
[4] "We conclude that optimal ODH catalysts should 1) generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2) not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and the risk of producing unwanted byproducts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient method with a higher yield of propylene. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One of the challenges is selecting the appropriate oxidant. Using oxygen as the oxidant is advantageous due to its abundance and cost-effectiveness. Yet, it requires careful management to prevent the formation of unwanted byproducts like ethylene. Another challenge is maintaining the selectivity of the process. While boron nitride catalysts are selective for propylene production, the reaction mechanism is complex, involving both surface-initiated radical reactions and gas-phase chemistry. Optimizing the catalyst to balance surface reactions and gas-phase radical propagation is crucial for achieving high propylene selectivity. The conclusion is that for optimal ODHP catalysts, they should efficiently generate reactive species that preferentially abstract secondary CH bonds in propane, while avoiding strong interactions with reaction intermediates and products to minimize surface oxidation steps.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和副产品的风险。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能的方法和更高的丙烯产率来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP具有自己的优势和限制。一个挑战是选择合适的氧化剂。使用氧气作为氧化剂具有优势，因为它丰富且成本效益高。然而，需要仔细管理以防止形成不希望的副产品，如乙烯。另一个挑战是保持反应过程的选择性。尽管硼氮化物催化剂对丙烯有选择性，但其反应机制复杂，涉及表面引发的自由基反应和气体相化学。优化催化剂以平衡表面反应和气体相自由基传播对于实现高丙烯选择性至关重要。结论是，对于最佳的ODHP催化剂，它们应高效地生成优先从丙烷中提取二级CH键的活性物种，同时避免与反应中间体和产物产生强烈相互作用，以减少表面氧化步骤。
