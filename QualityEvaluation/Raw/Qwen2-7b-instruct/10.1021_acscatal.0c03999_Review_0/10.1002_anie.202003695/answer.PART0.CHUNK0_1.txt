[1] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavage—the most important side-reaction—is controlled by the oxygen concentration."
[2] "Considering the possible radical pathways involved in hBN-catalyzed ODH, we aim to gain insight into the reactions that could take place both at the surface and in the gas phase."
[3] "Our previous experimental studies show that the surface of boron-based catalysts oxyfunctionalizes during ODH chemistry, but it remained unclear as to which species in the amorphous hydroxy oxide layer could be responsible for the observed activity."
[4] "We concluded that optimal ODH catalysts should 1)generate reactive H-abstracting species that favor the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, and 2)not interact strongly with intermediates and products to minimize fast consecutive surface oxidation steps."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and environmental concerns due to the use of fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially cleaner and more energy-efficient alternative for propylene production. This method reduces dependency on fossil fuels and lowers emissions. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One key challenge is the selection of an appropriate oxidant, with oxygen being the most common choice. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include maintaining high selectivity, managing the reaction conditions, and ensuring efficient radical propagation in the gas phase. The limitations include the need for precise control over reaction parameters and the potential for side reactions, such as carbon-carbon bond cleavage, which can lead to the formation of ethylene as a byproduct. The document emphasizes the importance of understanding the complex surface-gas-phase reaction network and the role of free-radical chemistry in ODHP, which differs significantly from mechanisms proposed for vanadium-based catalysts.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗和环境问题，由于依赖化石燃料。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种更清洁、更高效的丙烯生产替代方案来解决这些问题。这种方法减少了对化石燃料的依赖，并降低了排放。然而，ODHP也存在自己的优势和限制。一个关键的挑战是选择合适的氧化剂，氧气是最常见的选择。使用氧气的具体挑战包括保持高选择性、管理反应条件以及确保气体相中自由基的有效传播。限制因素包括需要精确控制反应参数，以及潜在的副反应，如碳-碳键断裂，这可能导致乙烷作为副产品形成。文献强调理解复杂的表面-气体相反应网络和自由基化学在ODHP中的重要性，这与为范德华催化剂提出的方法大不相同。
