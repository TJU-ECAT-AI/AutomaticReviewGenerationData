[1] "Beyond surface speciation, there are observations from catalytic studies that require complementary investigation. Reaction kinetic studies have shown that the predominance of dehydrogenation versus CC bond cleavage—the most important side-reaction—is controlled by the oxygen concentration."
[2] "To complement these observed activity improvements with wet ODH feeds, we varied water concentrations between 120mol% under two propane concentrations (15 and 25mol%; Supporting Information, FigureS1)."
[3] "The cycling experiment may provide insights into the various effects that water has on the observed reactivity. Approximately 70% of the total conversion change happens within the first hour of a cycle."
[4] "In line with previous reports,5, 11 CC cracking pathways to produce C2H4 become increasingly important under oxygen lean conditions."
[5] "From a catalytic materials perspective, we hypothesize that surface species that can initiate oxidation while also favoring i-propyl radical formation would lead to enhanced ODH performance."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and the risk of environmental pollution due to the use of fossil fuels and the release of greenhouse gases. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially cleaner alternative, utilizing atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant, which reduces the need for expensive and hazardous synthetic oxidants. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the optimization of the oxidant selection and the control of the reaction conditions to maximize propylene yield while minimizing the formation of unwanted by-products like ethylene and carbon monoxide. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include its high reactivity, which can lead to a rapid loss in selectivity as the propane conversion increases, necessitating careful control over reaction parameters.

The document also highlights the advantage of ODHP in addressing the issue of fossil fuel dependency and environmental impact, as atmospheric oxygen is abundantly available and its use minimizes the need for additional, potentially harmful synthetic oxidants. However, achieving high propylene selectivity remains a challenge, especially in the presence of oxygen, which can lead to competing pathways such as CC bond cleavage, producing ethylene and other undesired by-products.

In terms of the limitations, the document emphasizes the need for catalyst development that can efficiently generate reactive H-abstracting species favoring the abstraction of secondary CH bonds in propane, while minimizing interactions with intermediates and products to prevent fast consecutive surface oxidation steps. This is crucial for maintaining high selectivity towards propylene, as seen in the contrasting reaction mechanisms of boron-based catalysts versus traditional vanadium-based catalysts, where the former operates via a surface-initiated free-radical gas-phase reaction, whereas the latter relies on surface-bound intermediates and products.

Optimal ODHP catalysts should aim to enhance selectivity by optimizing the void space in the catalyst bed to facilitate efficient gas-phase reactions and developing catalysts capable of generating HOO radicals rather than alkyl radicals. This approach not only improves the efficiency of propylene production but also aligns with the broader goal of reducing environmental impact and increasing the sustainability of chemical manufacturing processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和环境污染物排放的风险，由于依赖化石燃料以及温室气体的释放。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供可能更清洁的替代方案来解决这些问题，利用大气氧气作为氧化剂，从而减少了昂贵且危险的合成氧化剂的需求。然而，ODHP自身也存在一系列挑战，特别是优化氧化剂选择和控制反应条件以最大化丙烯产量的同时减少副产品如乙烯和一氧化碳的形成。

使用氧气的具体挑战包括其高度活性，可能导致在丙烷转化增加时迅速失去选择性，需要仔细控制反应参数。文档还强调了通过减少对化石燃料的依赖和减轻环境影响来应对的问题，因为大气氧气供应充足，并且其使用减少了额外有害合成氧化剂的需求。

ODHP的局限性在于需要催化剂开发，以高效生成促进丙烷中二级CH键脱氢的活性H摘取物种，同时最小化与中间体和产品的相互作用以防止表面氧化步骤的快速连续发生。这对于保持高丙烯选择性至关重要，与传统的钒基催化剂相比，后者依赖于表面吸附的中间体和产物，而前者则通过表面引发的自由基气相反应进行操作。

理想的ODHP催化剂应旨在通过优化催化剂床的孔隙空间来提高效率，促进高效的气相反应，并开发能够生成过氧化氢而不是烷基自由基的催化剂。这种策略不仅提高了丙烯生产的效率，而且与更广泛的降低环境影响和提高化学制造过程可持续性的目标相一致。
