The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the selectivity and activity of the catalysts used in ODHP processes are significant challenges. In particular, the selection of the oxidant and the prevention of coke formation are critical aspects of the technology. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP processes presents specific challenges, such as the requirement for high-purity oxygen supply and the management of reaction temperature to prevent overheating and coke formation. This review focuses on the kinetics of ODHP reactions over well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, aiming to provide insights into the mechanisms and optimization strategies for improving the efficiency and selectivity of these catalysts.
