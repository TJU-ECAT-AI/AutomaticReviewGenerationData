1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high CO2 emissions, and limited flexibility. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly method for propylene production. This process utilizes oxygen as the oxidant, which is abundant, non-toxic, and inexpensive.
2. While the use of oxygen in ODHP processes is advantageous, it also introduces challenges due to its high reactivity. These challenges include the need for high conversion temperatures and pressures to ensure complete conversion of propane to propylene, the potential formation of undesirable byproducts such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and the requirement for further investigation into the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions to optimize the process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高CO2排放和灵活性有限。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种可能更高效和环保的丙烯生产方法来解决这些问题。该过程使用氧气作为氧化剂，氧气丰富、无毒且成本低廉。
2. 尽管在ODHP过程中使用氧气具有优势，但也带来了挑战，由于氧气的高反应性。这些挑战包括需要高温和高压以确保丙烷完全转化为丙烯，潜在形成不希望的副产品如一氧化碳和二氧化碳，以及在优化过程时需要进一步研究在氧化脱氢条件下钒氧化物催化剂的稳定性和活性。
