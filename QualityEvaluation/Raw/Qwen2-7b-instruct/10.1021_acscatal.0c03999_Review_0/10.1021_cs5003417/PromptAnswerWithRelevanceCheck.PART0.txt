1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high CO2 emissions, and limited flexibility. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly method for propylene production. This process utilizes oxygen as the oxidant, which is abundant, non-toxic, and inexpensive.
2. While the use of oxygen in ODHP processes is advantageous, it also introduces challenges due to its high reactivity. These challenges include the need for high conversion temperatures and pressures to ensure complete conversion of propane to propylene, the potential formation of undesirable byproducts such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and the requirement for further investigation into the stability and activity of vanadium oxide catalysts under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions to optimize the process.
