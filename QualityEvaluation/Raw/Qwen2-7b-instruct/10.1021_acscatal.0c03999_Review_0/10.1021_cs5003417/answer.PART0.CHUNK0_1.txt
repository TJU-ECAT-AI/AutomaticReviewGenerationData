[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an attractive alternative to current propylene production methods."
[2] "It offers several advantages, including higher energy efficiency, lower environmental impact, and potentially lower costs."
[3] "However, ODHP faces significant challenges, particularly related to catalyst stability, selectivity, and the efficient use of oxidants."
[4] "In the context of using oxygen as the oxidant, the high reactivity and potential for side reactions pose particular challenges."
[5] "The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include its high cost, the risk of formation of unwanted byproducts, and the need for robust catalyst designs to withstand the harsh reaction conditions."

ODHP addresses the primary challenges in current propylene production methods by offering higher energy efficiency, a lower environmental impact, and potentially lower costs. However, it presents its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning the selection of oxidants and specific challenges related to the use of oxygen. Oxygen, as the oxidant, poses challenges due to its high reactivity, which can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, and the need for robust catalyst designs to withstand harsh reaction conditions.
