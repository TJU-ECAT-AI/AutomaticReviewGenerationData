The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking, are high energy consumption, high CO2 emissions, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a method with potential to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. However, ODHP has its own set of advantages and limitations. Oxygen is commonly used as an oxidant in ODHP due to its high reactivity and environmental benefits. Yet, using oxygen presents specific challenges, including its high cost and safety issues related to handling and storage.
