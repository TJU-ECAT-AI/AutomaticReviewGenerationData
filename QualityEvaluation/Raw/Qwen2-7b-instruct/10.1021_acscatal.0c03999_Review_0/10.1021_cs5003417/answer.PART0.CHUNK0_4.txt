1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and environmental impact. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient alternative. This process also offers advantages such as higher propylene yield compared to traditional methods. However, ODHP faces limitations in terms of propylene selectivity and oxidant efficiency. The use of oxygen as an oxidant presents challenges due to its reactivity and potential for side reactions. Careful control of reaction conditions is required to maximize propylene yield.
