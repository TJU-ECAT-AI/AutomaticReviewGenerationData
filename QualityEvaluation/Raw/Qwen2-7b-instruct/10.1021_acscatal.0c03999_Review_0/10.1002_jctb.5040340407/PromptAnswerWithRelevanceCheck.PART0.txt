The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by applying an oxidative process, thus removing the thermodynamic limitations. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning the selection of oxidants and the challenges associated with using oxygen as the oxidant. The literature indicates that different catalysts, primarily metal oxides and sulphides, have been used in ODHP, but there is limited published research on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts for this type of reaction. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range of 825-884 K. The addition of sulfur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion but significantly reduced the selectivity to propylene formation. The literature concludes that the effect of sulfur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex, involving the formation of various products including carbon dioxide, which suggests that the initial propane reaction might be unselective or that some of the propylene product could be oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是传统脱氢化过程的热力学限制。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程，从而消除了热力学限制，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择氧化剂和使用氧气作为氧化剂时也存在一系列优势和局限性。文献表明，不同的催化剂，主要是金属氧化物和硫化物，已被用于ODHP，但关于催化剂的动态性和金属在该类型反应中的应用的公开研究相对较少。在825-884 K的温度范围内首次对丙烷脱氢化进行了研究。向丙烯流中添加二氧化硫增加了总的转化率，但显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。文献总结指出，二氧化硫对丙烷脱氢化机制的影响是复杂的，涉及形成各种产品，包括二氧化碳，这表明最初的丙烷反应可能不具选择性，或者部分丙烯产物可能被氧化为二氧化碳和水。

1. Current propylene production methods face thermodynamic limitations due to the conventional dehydrogenation process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by applying an oxidative process, which removes the thermodynamic limitations. However, this method presents challenges related to selecting appropriate oxidants and dealing with specific catalyst-related issues.
2. In the context of ODHP, different catalysts, primarily metal oxides and sulfides, have been utilized. Yet, the literature highlights the scarcity of research on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts for this type of reaction. The focus of the current study is on preliminary kinetic investigations of propane dehydrogenation and its reaction with sulfur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst.
3. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was initially explored within the temperature range of 825-884 K. This investigation aimed to understand the effect of propane partial pressure on the rate of dehydrogenation to propylene, revealing first-order kinetics with an apparent activation energy of 128 kJ mol−1.
4. The inclusion of sulfur dioxide in the propylene feed led to an increase in the overall rate of conversion. However, it significantly reduced the selectivity for propylene formation. For instance, at 855 K, the selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion with 0.0134 mol of sulfur dioxide present in the feed, compared to 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2.

2. 在ODHP的背景下，不同的催化剂，主要是金属氧化物和硫化物，已经被使用。然而，文献强调了关于催化剂的热力学和使用金属作为此类反应催化剂的研究相对较少。当前研究的重点是初步探索丙烷脱氢及其与氧化铝负载钯催化剂中硫化二氧碳的反应的热力学性质。
3. 在825-884 K的温度范围内，首先研究了丙烷脱氢到丙烯的过程。这项调查旨在了解丙烷部分压力对脱氢到丙烯速率的影响，发现了一级动力学，其显式激活能为128 kJ mol−1。
4. 在丙烯流中添加二氧化硫导致整体转化率增加。然而，它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。例如，在855 K时，当有0.0134摩尔二氧化硫存在于进料中时，丙烯的选择性为19.10%转换时为20.6%，而没有SO2时为18.0%转换时为93.1%选择性。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the thermodynamic limitations faced by conventional dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by applying an oxidative process, which removes these thermodynamic constraints. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The selection of oxidants, such as oxygen, halogens, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and carbonyl sulfide, plays a crucial role in the efficiency of propylene production. The use of various catalysts, including metal oxides and sulfides, has been explored, but the kinetics and utilization of metals as catalysts for this process remain understudied. The present study focuses on preliminary kinetic investigations of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of sulfur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst. The reaction between propane and sulfur dioxide is represented by the equation: 3C3Hg+S02 ---.t 3C3H,+HZS+2HzO. The reaction yields not only propylene and hydrogen sulfide but also water and carbon dioxide. The impact of sulfur dioxide on the dehydrogenation mechanism of propane to propylene is found to be complex.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include thermodynamic limitations, which oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses by applying an oxidative process that removes these limitations. This method allows for the conversion of propane to propylene using various oxidants such as oxygen, halogens, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and carbonyl sulfide. However, the use of different catalysts, primarily metal oxides and sulfides, has been widely researched, but less so on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts in this reaction. 

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by employing an oxidative process that circumvents thermodynamic limitations, enabling the conversion of propane to propylene through the use of various oxidants. Despite this, the application of metals as catalysts in this reaction type has received less attention in the literature compared to other catalysts. The use of palladium-alumina catalysts in ODHP has been explored in preliminary kinetic investigations, and it has been observed that the presence of CO2, among other products, indicates either an unselective initial propane reaction or the oxidation of propylene to CO2 and H2O.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括热力学限制，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程来解决这一问题，从而消除了这些限制。这种方法允许使用各种氧化剂如氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和羰基硫化物将丙烷转化为丙烯。然而，与不同催化剂（主要是金属氧化物和硫化物）相比，关于本反应类型中金属催化剂的热力学和应用的研究较少。

2. 氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程来解决这些问题，该过程绕过了热力学限制，使丙烷能够通过使用各种氧化剂转化为丙烯。尽管如此，在使用金属作为催化剂的研究上，文献中的关注较少，而与其他催化剂相比。在初步的热力学研究中，已经探索了钯铝氧催化剂在ODHP中的应用，并观察到CO2等其他产物的存在表明初始丙烷反应可能不具有选择性，或者部分丙烯产品可能被氧化为CO2和H2O。
