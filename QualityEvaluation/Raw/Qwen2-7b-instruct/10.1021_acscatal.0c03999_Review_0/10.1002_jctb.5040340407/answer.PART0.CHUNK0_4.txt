1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include thermodynamic limitations, which oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses by applying an oxidative process that removes these limitations. This method allows for the conversion of propane to propylene using various oxidants such as oxygen, halogens, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and carbonyl sulfide. However, the use of different catalysts, primarily metal oxides and sulfides, has been widely researched, but less so on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts in this reaction. 

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by employing an oxidative process that circumvents thermodynamic limitations, enabling the conversion of propane to propylene through the use of various oxidants. Despite this, the application of metals as catalysts in this reaction type has received less attention in the literature compared to other catalysts. The use of palladium-alumina catalysts in ODHP has been explored in preliminary kinetic investigations, and it has been observed that the presence of CO2, among other products, indicates either an unselective initial propane reaction or the oxidation of propylene to CO2 and H2O.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括热力学限制，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程来解决这一问题，从而消除了这些限制。这种方法允许使用各种氧化剂如氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和羰基硫化物将丙烷转化为丙烯。然而，与不同催化剂（主要是金属氧化物和硫化物）相比，关于本反应类型中金属催化剂的热力学和应用的研究较少。

2. 氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程来解决这些问题，该过程绕过了热力学限制，使丙烷能够通过使用各种氧化剂转化为丙烯。尽管如此，在使用金属作为催化剂的研究上，文献中的关注较少，而与其他催化剂相比。在初步的热力学研究中，已经探索了钯铝氧催化剂在ODHP中的应用，并观察到CO2等其他产物的存在表明初始丙烷反应可能不具有选择性，或者部分丙烯产品可能被氧化为CO2和H2O。
