[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."
[2] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."
[3] "The present communication deals with preliminary kinetic investigations of the reaction of propane and propane with sulphur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range 825-884 K."
[5] "For example at 855 K, selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion (with 0.0134 mol of sulphur dioxide present in the feed) as compared with 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2."

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitations faced by conventional dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by applying an oxidative process, which removes these thermodynamic constraints. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly concerning the selection of oxidants and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen. The study focuses on preliminary kinetic investigations of the reaction of propane with sulfur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst. The results suggest that at 855 K, the selectivity to propylene was 20.6% with 19.10% conversion, compared to 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of sulfur dioxide. These findings highlight the complexity of the reaction mechanism involving sulfur dioxide and its impact on the dehydrogenation process.

主要挑战在于当前丙烯生产方法的热力学限制。氧化脱氢法通过应用氧化过程，消除了这些热力学约束，从而解决了这些问题。然而，氧化脱氢法在选择氧化剂以及使用氧气时存在自己的优势和局限性。研究专注于钯氧化铝催化剂上丙烷与二氧化硫反应的初步动力学研究。结果表明，在855 K下，当硫化氢和水作为副产物存在时，丙烯的产率从19.10%的转化率增加了20.6%，而没有硫化氧时的转化率为18.0%，选择性为93.1%。这些发现强调了二氧化硫反应机制的复杂性及其对脱氢过程的影响。
