1. Current propylene production methods face thermodynamic limitations due to the conventional dehydrogenation process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by applying an oxidative process, which removes the thermodynamic limitations. However, this method presents challenges related to selecting appropriate oxidants and dealing with specific catalyst-related issues.
2. In the context of ODHP, different catalysts, primarily metal oxides and sulfides, have been utilized. Yet, the literature highlights the scarcity of research on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts for this type of reaction. The focus of the current study is on preliminary kinetic investigations of propane dehydrogenation and its reaction with sulfur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst.
3. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was initially explored within the temperature range of 825-884 K. This investigation aimed to understand the effect of propane partial pressure on the rate of dehydrogenation to propylene, revealing first-order kinetics with an apparent activation energy of 128 kJ mol−1.
4. The inclusion of sulfur dioxide in the propylene feed led to an increase in the overall rate of conversion. However, it significantly reduced the selectivity for propylene formation. For instance, at 855 K, the selectivity to propylene was 20.6% at 19.10% conversion with 0.0134 mol of sulfur dioxide present in the feed, compared to 93.1% selectivity at 18.0% conversion in the absence of SO2.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临热力学限制，由于传统的脱氢过程。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程解决了这些问题，从而消除了热力学限制。然而，这种方法在选择合适的氧化剂和处理特定催化剂相关问题方面存在挑战。
2. 在ODHP的背景下，不同的催化剂，主要是金属氧化物和硫化物，已经被使用。然而，文献强调了关于催化剂的热力学和使用金属作为此类反应催化剂的研究相对较少。当前研究的重点是初步探索丙烷脱氢及其与氧化铝负载钯催化剂中硫化二氧碳的反应的热力学性质。
3. 在825-884 K的温度范围内，首先研究了丙烷脱氢到丙烯的过程。这项调查旨在了解丙烷部分压力对脱氢到丙烯速率的影响，发现了一级动力学，其显式激活能为128 kJ mol−1。
4. 在丙烯流中添加二氧化硫导致整体转化率增加。然而，它显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。例如，在855 K时，当有0.0134摩尔二氧化硫存在于进料中时，丙烯的选择性为19.10%转换时为20.6%，而没有SO2时为18.0%转换时为93.1%选择性。
