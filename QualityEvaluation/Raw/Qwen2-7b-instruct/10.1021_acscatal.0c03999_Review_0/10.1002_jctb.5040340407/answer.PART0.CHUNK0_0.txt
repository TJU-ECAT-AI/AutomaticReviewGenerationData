[1] "A major development in the field of propane dehydrogenation has been the application of an oxidative process for this reaction, thereby removing the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation."
[2] "Although different catalysts, mainly metal oxides and sulphides, have been used for the above process, little has been published on the kinetics5 and/or the use of metals as catalysts for this type of reation."

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the thermodynamic limitations of conventional dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by applying an oxidative process, thus removing the thermodynamic limitations. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning the selection of oxidants and the challenges associated with using oxygen as the oxidant. The literature indicates that different catalysts, primarily metal oxides and sulphides, have been used in ODHP, but there is limited published research on the kinetics and the utilization of metals as catalysts for this type of reaction. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated in the temperature range of 825-884 K. The addition of sulfur dioxide to the propylene feed increased the overall rate of conversion but significantly reduced the selectivity to propylene formation. The literature concludes that the effect of sulfur dioxide on the mechanism of dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is complex, involving the formation of various products including carbon dioxide, which suggests that the initial propane reaction might be unselective or that some of the propylene product could be oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是传统脱氢化过程的热力学限制。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程，从而消除了热力学限制，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择氧化剂和使用氧气作为氧化剂时也存在一系列优势和局限性。文献表明，不同的催化剂，主要是金属氧化物和硫化物，已被用于ODHP，但关于催化剂的动态性和金属在该类型反应中的应用的公开研究相对较少。在825-884 K的温度范围内首次对丙烷脱氢化进行了研究。向丙烯流中添加二氧化硫增加了总的转化率，但显著降低了丙烯形成的选择性。文献总结指出，二氧化硫对丙烷脱氢化机制的影响是复杂的，涉及形成各种产品，包括二氧化碳，这表明最初的丙烷反应可能不具选择性，或者部分丙烯产物可能被氧化为二氧化碳和水。
