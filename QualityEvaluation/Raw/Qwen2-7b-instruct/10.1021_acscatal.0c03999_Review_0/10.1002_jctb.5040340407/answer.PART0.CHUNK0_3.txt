The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the thermodynamic limitations faced by conventional dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by applying an oxidative process, which removes these thermodynamic constraints. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The selection of oxidants, such as oxygen, halogens, sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and carbonyl sulfide, plays a crucial role in the efficiency of propylene production. The use of various catalysts, including metal oxides and sulfides, has been explored, but the kinetics and utilization of metals as catalysts for this process remain understudied. The present study focuses on preliminary kinetic investigations of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of sulfur dioxide over a palladium-alumina catalyst. The reaction between propane and sulfur dioxide is represented by the equation: 3C3Hg+S02 ---.t 3C3H,+HZS+2HzO. The reaction yields not only propylene and hydrogen sulfide but also water and carbon dioxide. The impact of sulfur dioxide on the dehydrogenation mechanism of propane to propylene is found to be complex.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是传统脱氢化过程面临的热力学限制。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过应用氧化过程解决了这些问题，从而消除了这些热力学约束。然而，ODHP具有自身的优势和局限性。氧化剂的选择，如氧气、卤素、硫、二氧化硫和羰基硫，对丙烯生产效率起着关键作用。已经探索了各种催化剂，包括金属氧化物和硫化物，但关于此过程中的催化剂的热力学和利用的研究仍然不足。目前的研究集中在钯氧化铝催化剂上对丙烷脱氢的初步动力学研究。丙烷与二氧化硫的反应表示为：3C3Hg+S02 ---.t 3C3H,+HZS+2HzO。该反应不仅产生丙烯和氢化硫，还会生成水和二氧化碳。二氧化硫对丙烷脱氢机制的影响被发现是复杂的。
