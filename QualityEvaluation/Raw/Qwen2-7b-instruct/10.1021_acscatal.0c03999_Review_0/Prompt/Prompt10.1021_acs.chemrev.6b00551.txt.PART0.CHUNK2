Ru- and Rh-Based Catalysts Methane oxybromination over Ru- and Rh-based catalysts was studied at 853953 K. (58, 60, 290) The product distribution was found to be influenced significantly by temperature over BaLaNiRu/SiO2 but much milder over Rh/SiO2 (Figures 37, panels a and b). A high CH3Br selectivity of 90% can be achieved over both catalysts at 803833 K. (58, 60) The stability of Rh/SiO2, derived from a solgel method, was demonstrated via a 650 h on stream test, showing essentially a stable methane conversion, while CH3Br selectivity even witnessed a slight increase with reaction time (Figure 37c). Elemental analysis revealed the severe Rh leaching from 0.41 to 0.15 wt % after the evaluation. (308) Besides, the selection of supports for Rh catalyst is crucial. It has been experimentally evidenced that the combustion products, CO/CO2, were substantial for ZrO2- and TiO2-supported Rh catalysts, whereas high CH3Br selectivity was only obtained for inert supports with preferably low surface areas such as SiC and SiO2. (291, 308) The reaction route over these precious metal catalysts was suggested to follow gas-phase radical reactions (Figure 37d). Bromine radicals are proposed to be generated at the surface of solid catalysts rather than in the gas phase that would require much higher activation temperatures. Comparative experiments on Ru-based catalysts proved that carbon oxides were most likely originated from CH3Br by steam reforming or oxidation rather than from deep oxidation of methane.

Non-Noble Metal Oxide Catalysts A screening of various silica-supported nonprecious metal oxides (V2O5, CeO2, MoO3, BaO, and WO3) was conducted, aiming at replacing noble metal-based catalysts with cheaper alternatives for methane oxybromination. (292) Unfortunately, these catalysts generally led to a poor CH3Br selectivity and a significant CO production. A CH3Br selectivity of ca. 50% was obtained with above 40% conversion of CH4 at 893 K over BaO/SiO2. The metathesis between BaO and BaBr2 was ascribed to be responsible for bromine formation. However, the leaching of a substantial amount of barium was observed during a 30 h test, rendering this catalyst less attractive. Bulk CeO2 with different morphologies was studied in the oxybromination of methane. (264) The CH4 conversion and CH3Br selectivity curves show that CeO2 nanocubes comprise the most selective morphology (Figure 36b). Besides, both the activity and CH3Br selectivity can be further enhanced by doping with NiO. The stability of NiO-CeO2 (10 wt % NiO) was demonstrated during 100 h time-on-stream (Figure 36d). The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism was proposed to explain methane oxybromination on the CeO2-based catalyst (Figure 36e).
Iron Phosphates Ding et al. studied methane oxybromination over a series of bulk and supported iron phosphates with the aim of achieving equimolar CH3Br plus CO (a presumed feedstock for acetic acid synthesis). (291, 293-296) A 10 wt % FePO4/SiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation led to a methane conversion of 50% and a total selectivity of 96% for CH3Br and CO (CH3Br:CO  1) at 843 K. (296) The catalyst showed a relatively stable performance for 100 h on stream, but severe reduction in catalyst surface area (from 363 to 36 m2 g1) and coke deposition were observed. (294) This was claimed to be resulting from the accumulation of CH2Br2, which was identified as the predominant precursor of deposited coke in the CH3Br-to-olefins transformation. (309, 310) Since iron phosphate is relatively stable in oxybromination ambience, a straightforward strategy to improve the catalyst stability was to find a coke-resistant support. FePO4-SBA-15, synthesized via a one-pot hydrothermal method by the same group, provided similar activity as FePO4/SiO2 but without any coke deposition for a duration of 1000 h (Figure 38a). (293) Electron microscopy of the used catalyst confirmed that the ordered mesoporous structure of the catalyst was well-kept, although the surface area was reduced to half. A slight leaching of Fe (3.36 to 3.04 wt %) and P (2.06 to 1.74 wt %) was revealed by elemental analysis. (293) Several bulk iron phosphate catalysts have also been evaluated in the oxybromination reaction at higher temperatures, among which Na3Fe2(PO4)3, obtained via a fluoride route, was found to be even more active than bulk FePO4 [X(CH4) = 49%, S(CH3Br) = 52%, T = 913 K]. (295) Although all these iron phosphates have demonstrated their excellent stability and moderate activity toward oxybromination reaction, the selectivity to CH3Br is relatively low (around 50% at appreciable methane conversions) compared with that over precious metal-based catalysts.

The phase evolution of the iron phosphate catalyst was studied by combined characterization techniques. Time-dependent experiments on used FePO4/SiO2, examined by 57Fe Mssbauer spectroscopy, convincingly revealed that both ferric and ferrous ions existed in the stable catalysts, and at least two different routes were involved from the conversion of original FePO4 phase into both α-Fe3(P2O7)2 and Fe2P2O7 (Figure 38b). (296) Quantitative analysis of the relative ratio of these two different phases from 57Fe Mssbauer spectra showed a stable molar ratio of ca. 1:1 for α-Fe3(P2O7)2:Fe2P2O7 for all the used catalysts after an induction period. It is noted that α-Fe3(P2O7)2 contains both ferric and ferrous ions with an atomic ratio of 2:1. In a number of selective oxidation reactions based on bulk iron phosphate catalysts, α-Fe3(P2O7)2 has been recognized as the most active phase due to the unique configuration of three face-sharing FeO6 octahedra clusters (Figure 38c, inset). (311, 312) Theoretical studies using extended Hckel molecular orbital theory suggested an electron delocalization between the adjacent iron cations in the mixed-valence ironoxygen trimer. (313) Such a configuration may facilitate the generation of intervalence for the Fe3+/Fe2+ redox couple during catalytic reactions. (311, 314) Another phosphate containing mixed valence iron ions, Fe7(PO4)6, was identified in the used FePO4-SBA-15 catalyst. (293) Similar results were also found on Na3Fe2(PO4)3 which, after the reaction, was reduced to Na2Fe3(PO4)3 with a lower ferric to ferrous ions atomic ratio of 1:2. (295) The above findings seem to support that the oxybromination over iron phosphate catalysts proceeded in a redox mechanism, wherein the redox pair of Fe3+/Fe2+ might play a crucial role in the catalytic process. In this sense, the development of controlled synthesis of iron phosphates with mixed iron valences and tailored structures might be an interesting direction to the discovery of superior oxybromination catalysts.
Vanadium Phosphates Recent studies aiming to find improved catalysts for methane oxybromination have culminated in the discovery of vanadium phosphates, leading to an unprecedented selectivity to CH3Br compared to the previously reported catalysts. (61) Interestingly, it is found that the operational window of all the active catalysts examined including CeO2 and FePO4 was advantageously shifted to lower temperatures at least by 100 K than those in the earlier literature. (264, 296) It is likely because this study (61) was conducted using dry HBr where the water inhibition is anticipated to be insignificant compared to that when wet HBr (40 wt % aqueous HBr solution) was used in other studies. (264, 296) The robustness of vanadium phosphate was demonstrated in a 100 h on stream test at 753 K, showing stable catalyst performance (X(CH4) = 25%, S(CH3Br) = 64%, Figure 39a). Phase evolution of vanadium phosphates during the reaction was unfolded by combined characterization techniques (Figure 39b). The fresh catalysts prepared by the phosphation of V2O5 through a typical organic route comprised of mainly VOPO4. It transformed into a reduced (VO)2P2O7 form after 5 h of treatment and equilibrium of the bulk-phase composition (mainly (VO)2P2O7 with a small amount of V5+ species) was reached within 15 h.

The reaction mechanism of vanadium phosphates has been systematically studied based on a set of comparative experiments. (61) Investigation of the gas-phase methane bromination and catalyzed oxybromination at similar reaction conditions revealed a similar onset temperature (675 K) and the trends in methane conversion and product distribution of brominated products. The only difference originates from CO formation in the latter reaction. In another oxybromination experiment, the conversion of HBr and bromine yield were quantified as a function of temperature. Increasing productivity of the bromomethanes was observed to be accompanied by decreasing HBr conversion and bromine yield, with a rise of reaction temperature. The above results on vanadium phosphates evidenced the synergistic cooperation between the heterogeneously catalyzed HBr oxidation and gas-phase alkane bromination, mediated by radicals continuously supplied from the bromine pool that is, in turn, regenerated on the catalyst surface by molecular oxygen. The CH bond scission is therefore decoupled from the highly reactive oxygen species on the catalyst, which would generally promote the undesired deeper oxidation of alkane and brominated products. Thus, the outstanding performance of vanadium phosphate was rationalized by the high activity in HBr oxidation and low propensity for methane and bromomethane oxidation. (61) The performance of vanadium phosphate was optimized toward high CH3Br yield by variation of reaction conditions (Figure 39c). Increasing the feed content of methane from 4.5 to 10 vol % led to a 10% increase in CH3Br selectivity with a doubled productivity at 753 K. The selectivity was further boosted to 91% by decreasing the temperature to 693 K with a 10 vol % CH4 in the feed. An increase in the total pressure from 1.4 to 1.8 bar caused an increase in methane conversion with only a slight drop in selectivity [S(CH3Br) > 86%]. The applicability of vanadium phosphates under realistic reactant-rich feed (CH4 concentration up to 18 vol % while keeping the reactants molar ratio constant) has been tested. (61) Small alterations in product distribution at similar methane conversions and a strong enhancement of the CH3Br productivity were observed, demonstrating the scalability of the catalyst performance.
3.3 Oxyhalogenation of Higher Hydrocarbons (C2C4)
Gas- and liquid-phase halogenation reactions hold significant importance in organic synthesis for the fine chemical industry since organic chlorides and bromides are widely used as synthetic precursors for various coupling reactions in organic and pharmaceutical synthesis. (315) Conventional halogenation methods typically use toxic molecular halogens, which generate undesirable hydrohalic acid byproducts and inevitably reduce the halogen atom efficiency (a maximum of 50%). Strategies using oxychlorination and oxybromination of higher hydrocarbons with HCl/HBr over solid catalysts have been constantly explored, offering more sustainable approaches. (316-318)
3.3.1 Oxybromination of Ethane
Ethane oxybromination has been studied using HBr as the mediator both in anhydrous and in aqueous solution. (61, 62) Ethyl bromide and ethylene are the predominant products at 573833 K, the rest being mainly other brominated hydrocarbons, together with CH4 and carbon oxides formed at higher temperatures. Zhou et al. reported a single pass ethane conversion of 34% with a maximal bromoethane selectivity of 87% at 653 K over LaCl3-KCl-FeCl3/SiO2 catalysts. (62) A high C2H5Br selectivity was also observed over vanadium phosphates. (61) In both studies, the temperature-dependent nature of product distribution was self-evident, which is in line with observations in ethane oxychlorination where increasing temperature usually resulted in selective formation of ethylene due to the sequential dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides. (27, 178) These results might be indicative of similar reaction routes for both reactions. The advantages of ethane oxybromination over the oxychlorination route can be summarized as follows: (i) bromoethanes by themselves can be used as end products without further upgrading (e.g., ethyl bromide is widely used as a solvent or an anesthetic in medicine) and as an ethylating agent in the production of pharmaceuticals in organic synthesis industry (315) and (ii) the easy separation of bromoethanes from ethylene, due to the large differences in boiling points.
3.3.2 Oxyhalogenation of Propane/Propylene
Propane oxychlorination, though rarely targeted, has been disclosed in a few patents. (319, 320) An early study on copper chloride-based catalysts showed a spectrum of chloro-derivatives (tri/tetra-chloroethylenes and tetrachloride) being the products. (320) Thus, selectivity control presents a formidable challenge for this reaction. Recently, Schweizer et al. showed that propene and allyl chloride can be selectively produced by porous LaOCl-catalyzed oxychlorination of propane with low combustion [X(C3H8) = 51%, S(C3H6+C3H5Cl) = 75%, T = 673 K]. (319) The high selectivity of C3H6 and C3H5Cl suggested that dehydrochlorination of both C3H7Cl and C3H6Cl2 occurred following sequential Cl-substitution of C3H8. This agrees well with another study by Testova et al., who found the predominating products shifted from chloropropanes to dehydrochlorination products in propane chlorination when the temperature was increased from 573 to 676 K. (321) Interestingly, propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate gave prominent C2H5Br instead of C3H7Br in the low-temperature region, and the propylene selectivity increased rapidly at the compensation of C2H5Br with increasing temperature. (61) The oxychlorination of propylene usually occurs in the temperature range of 473623 K. (317, 322, 323) It is of interest because, depending on the catalysts used and reaction conditions, the aimed products could be switched from 1,2-dichloropropane (addition product) to allyl chloride (substitution product). The latter, an important raw material for allyl alcohol, synthetic glycerol, and epoxy resin manufacture, is currently produced by high-temperature thermal chlorination (573873 K), suffering from a low selectivity and coking. (322, 324, 325) The catalyst plays a pivotal role in the oxychlorination of propylene. To date, metal chlorides are the most studied catalysts. The bond strength of MCl (M corresponds to metal in the catalysts) has been proposed as the descriptor for this reaction (Figure 40). For the metal chlorides with high binding energies, such as FeCl3 and CoCl2, the reactivity was low and i-propyl chloride was the main product. CuCl2 with moderate bond strength shows higher activity with the major product of 1,2-dichloropropane. Noble metal chlorides like PdCl2 and TeCl4 with lower binding energies are the most active and selective catalysts for producing allyl chloride. Miyake and Hanaya speculated that the interaction between the metal chloride and propylene might be the key to distinguish the addition reaction from the substitution reaction. (322) They assumed that there was a strong affinity for π-electrons on the double bond of propylene for Cu, whereas a π-allyl type interaction prevailed for Pd and Te. The reaction mechanism of propylene oxychlorination over PdCl2 catalysts was proposed by Fujimoto et al., (317, 326) in which π-allylic intermediate was formed by the interaction between Pd0 and propylene (eq 15). With chloride substitution from PdCl2, allyl chloride was released while Pd2+ cations were reduced back to Pd0 (eq 16). This reaction route was partly supported by the observation that the optimal formation rate of allyl chloride was obtained over the catalysts only with the coexistence of Pd2+/Pd0.

A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl. (323) Although TeCl4-based catalysts showed promising behavior in the one-step production of allyl chloride from propylene, in-depth understanding on the reaction route is still lacking. Limited knowledge in this field can only be glimpsed from early scattered patents. (327) A novel tandem process was reported by Stauffer for the synthesis of allyl chloride, comprising first the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane (eq 17) over copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K preferably in a shell and tube reactor, and then a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K to produce allyl chloride (eq 18). (328) Therefore, the net reaction (eq 19) of this tandem process is propylene oxychlorination to allyl chloride. The viability of this route should be further evaluated as no convincing reactivity results were disclosed in the patent.

3.3.3 Oxyhalogenation of Butane/Butadiene
Halogen functionality can be introduced into C4 aliphatic hydrocarbons by oxyhalogenation. The challenges with the activation of these long-chain molecules lie in achieving a high selectivity of the targeted product while maintaining reasonable conversion rates. Several organic intermediates can be prepared by these reactions. For instance, 1,1,4,4-tetrabromobutadiene was produced by the oxidative bromination of butane with oxygen and bromine in the presence of CuBr2KBr/γ-Al2O3 (90% selectivity at 523 K). (329) 1,4-Dichlorobutadiene, a useful solvent and an intermediate for dyestuffs, can also be selectively synthesized by direct oxychlorination of straight chain C4 hydrocarbons (butane, butene, and/or butadiene) over CuCl2KCl/γ-Al2O3 (X = 4165%, S = 5792%, at 563593 K). (330) There are several studies dealing with the catalyzed oxychlorination of butadiene to dichlorobutenes. (331-335) Among the viable reactions, including substitution, addition, cracking, and polymerization, it is of interest to promote only the addition of two chlorine atoms leading to a mixture of dichlorobutenes. A butadiene conversion of 65% with a total selectivity to dichlorobutenes of 71% was attained over CuCl2-KCl/SiO2 promoted by didymium (a mixture of elements Pr and Nd) at 553 K. (331) Todo and Hagiwara reported that CuCl2-LiCl-H3PO4 supported on sintered alumina-silica (SBET < 1 m2 g1), after modified with a trace amount of Zr (0.025 wt %), was extremely active and selective (X = 73%, S = 96%). (332-334) However, the promotional effect of Zr was not found when the support was replaced with SiC, (332) suggesting the presence of interactions between Zr and the sintered alumina-silica support.A novel process has been conceived for the synthesis of dicyanobutenes (Figure 41). (335) In the first step, the oxychlorination of 1,3-butadiene over CuCl2/pumice yielded 75% mixed dichlorobutenes at 543  10 K. After separation, the dichlorobutenes were directed to a cyanation reactor with HCN, where a substitution reaction occurred to produce dicyanobutenes. The liberated HCl can then be recycled back to the oxychlorination reactor. In this way, the halogen loop is closed by recycling the stripped HCl to the oxychlorination reactions.Figure 41 Figure 41. An integrated process from butadiene to dicyanobutenes, comprising butadiene oxychlorination to dichlorobutenes and the cyanation of the latter with HCN. The HCl produced by the second step can be recycled for oxychlorination to close the halogen loop. (335) Indeed, oxyhalogenation of higher aliphatic hydrocarbons provides an alternative route for the synthesis of important halogenated organic compounds. An atom-economic process can be achieved when these reactions are appropriately coupled with sequential steps where hydrogen halides can be quantitatively extracted. On the other hand, the reaction network becomes even more complicated with the growth of carbon chain length, which represents a big challenge for the selective activation of certain functionalities. Besides, these reactions are exothermic and proceed so readily that avoidance of hotspots in the catalyst bed and other problems related to adequate temperature control have been among the principal technical difficulties. (330)
3.4 Halogen-Assisted Dehydrogenation of Alkanes (C2C5)
Olefins are extensively used as building blocks in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers, oxygenates, and important chemical intermediates. The manufacture heavily relies on the steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, especially for light olefins. (336) These routes are energy-intensive, and the selectivity toward particular olefins is low, not to mention the dwindling petroleum reserves and fluctuating oil price. Therefore, there has been much research interest devoted to finding an alternative dehydrogenation process suitable for producing paraffins. (44-46, 265, 337-344) In this context, halogens play a unique role in the dehydrogenation of various alkanes, affording an exceptionally high selectivity to the respective alkenes (Table 6). Among the halogens, iodine is extremely effective. When used in conjunction with an alkaline acceptor to bind the iodide species, iodination of an alkane can give extensive dehydrogenation to olefins, diolefins, or aromatics. (44-46, 337-339) Depending on the forms of how halogens are involved, these reactions can be classified into three groups: iodine-mediated dehydrogenation, molten salts (metal chlorides and iodides) catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation, and bihalogen-aided dehydrogenation.

3.4.1 Iodine-Mediated Dehydrogenation
The substitution of molecular iodine with various hydrocarbons has long been known, but it is generally recognized that iodine is poorly reactive toward saturated hydrocarbons. Raley et al. studied the high-temperature (T > 673 K) reactions between iodine and hydrocarbons and demonstrated that a variety of paraffins can be dehydrogenated to corresponding monoolefins with the formation of stoichiometric HI. (46, 338, 339) A quick quenching of reaction effluents was claimed to be indispensable, otherwise a substantial amount of organic iodides can be formed. (46) It seems that this reaction is more favorable for the dehydrogenation of low-chain hydrocarbons (C2C3), which gives much higher selectivity to the corresponding alkenes (Table 6). A free radical mechanism was also proposed for the stoichiometric iodination, consisting of successive hydrogen abstraction reactions involving both atomic and molecular iodine. (46) Besides, high-temperature reactions of iodine with long-chain hydrocarbons (C6+) can lead to aromatization of higher aliphatic hydrocarbons (339) and the rearrangement of aliphatic free radicals (e.g., CH3C(CH3)R1CH = CR2R3  CH3CHR1CH2CH = CR2R3, R1, R2, R3 = H or CH3). (338)
3.4.2 Alkali Metal Chloride-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
Supported alkali metal chloride catalysts have been demonstrated to be one of the most promising candidates for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light aliphatic alkanes (C2C4) to olefins. (340) Activity and selectivity have been reported for the catalysts either with pure alkali metal chlorides or with several other divalent cations, such as LiCl, KCl, LiKCl, LiNaCl, LiSrCl, and LiBaCl, that are impregnated on various supports like (Dy2O3-promoted) MgO (265, 341, 342) and (metal oxide-promoted) sulfated-zirconia. (343, 344) The promotional effect of chlorides in these catalysts was reported by Lercher et al., who compared the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane between Li/Dy2O3MgO and LiCl/Dy2O3MgO and found that the chloride-modified catalysts were ten times more active than the chloride-free ones (Figure 42a). (349) It is speculated that a gas phase free radical reaction dominated over the latter and the rate-determining step is the activation of ethane to form an alkyl radical over the presumed active site Li+O. On the other hand, the intrinsic mechanism over chloride-promoted catalysts is still a matter of debate. For these catalysts, the interfaces generated by the introduction of molten salts under reaction conditions should play a crucial role in the observed performance. Instead of gassolid two-phase reactions, those catalyzed by molten salts involve gas-melt-solid three-phase interactions because the reaction temperature is generally approaching or above the melting point of these chlorides. It has been reported that the maximum ethylene selectivity can be directly corelated with the melting point of the eutectic composition on the catalyst support (Figure 42b). (342) A reverse Mars-van Krevelen mechanism was suggested for the activation of ethane over KCl-LiCl/Dy2O3MgO (Figure 42c). In this mechanism, the activation of O2 and ethane were thought to occur at different interfaces (melt-solid and gas-melt, respectively). The active oxygen species, presumably OCl, were formed at the oxygen vacancies on the support that diffused through the molten salt overlayer to the surface where ethane dehydrogenation happened. Theoretical study on a model LiCl/MgO catalyst also showed that molecular adsorption of O2 at the LiCl/MgO interface was the only possible process. (350) Figure 42 Figure 42.

3.4.3 Metal Iodide-Catalyzed Oxidative Dehydrogenation
Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes can also be catalyzed by iodide-based molten salts. The difference between iodide- and chloride-catalyzed dehydrogenation processes can be visualized from the reaction products: while iodine substitution products are commonly observed over iodide-based molten salts, no chlorinated compounds are formed over metal chloride catalysts. In fact, iodide-aided oxidative dehydrogenation was developed to overcome the drawbacks encountered in the direct iodination of hydrocarbons. Although far superior olefin yields can be obtained by iodine-based route compared to other conventional catalytic dehydrogenation methods, these iodination reactions are endothermic requiring a large amount of energy, and the extent of dehydrogenation is intrinsically equilibrium limited. (337, 351) Among many approaches proposed to overcome these difficulties, oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of molten salts (acting as hydrogen iodide acceptors) is an effective alternative. In this way, iodine acts as a real mediator and can be in situ generated by continuous oxidation of HI byproduct, shifting the equilibrium constrain. From the viewpoint of energy consumption, the overall reaction becomes more exothermic due to the participation of oxygen. Compared to the iodination reactions, the oxidative dehydrogenation usually shows higher alkane conversions and comparable or even superior selectivity at much lower temperatures (Table 6).
The functions of metal iodides in the dehydrogenation have not been well-understood. The consensus is that they act as a mediator to adsorb and release I2. Constant-temperature ab initio molecular dynamics study of the reactions between LiI and gaseous molecules (O2, H2O, and I2) demonstrated that the most favorable process was the formation of gaseous I2, coproduced with LiOH or Li2O. If the reaction in the presence of water (which is the case in the dehydrogenation reactions) was allowed to reach equilibrium, I2 (g) and OH were the only species formed. (351) Thus, the dehydrogenation reactions most likely occurred in the gas phase. This is in agreement with a recent study on propane dehydrogenation which showed that the product distributions were quite similar under the same conditions when using either molecular iodine or LiI/LiOH as the iodine source. (347) Although the precise nature of the reactions involved in molten salt-mediated alkane dehydrogenation is not completely understood, the metathesis reactions between metal iodide and metal oxide can play a crucial role in the formation of iodine to initiate radical chain reactions and in the long-term stability. The promising catalysts to withstand these interlinked transformations should thus meet two prerequisites: (i) iodides are convertible at the dehydrogenation temperature to corresponding oxides by reacting with oxygen and (ii) the oxides can be converted back to iodide by contacting the iodine species. (44) The effect of oxygen can also be multiple. On one hand, oxygen is indispensable for the generation of iodine radicals to trigger the chain reactions. On the other hand, an excess amount of oxygen can cause combustion of the desirable dehydrogenation products. Thus, an optimal oxygen content should be considered to modulate the above two reactions. (347) Besides, Nager found that the presence of a very low concentration of hydrogen iodide in the iodine-mediated dehydrogenation reaction zone can substantially eliminate the necessity for a rapid quench of the reactor effluent as well as the recovery and recycling of large amount of iodine species normally required. (44) An interesting oxidative dehydrogenation process for various hydrocarbons, based on metal iodides, was developed by Shell (Figure 43a). (44, 45) It is proposed that the dehydrogenation reactions occurred at 698863 K over molten metal iodides (LiI, ZnI2, PbI2, and CdI2). The reactor effluent was then sent to a phase separator, wherein the organic products were recovered. The remaining aqueous phase contains mainly water and a residual iodide species escaping from the molten salt reactor. This was further directed to an iodine scavenger, comprising reactive metals or metal oxides to remove substantially all of the iodine species by forming corresponding metal iodides. With another oxidation step, the iodine can be regenerated and recycled back to the dehydrogenation reactor. An additional benefit of using a molten metal iodide is related to its high heat capacity and high heat conductivity, refraining from the hot spot formation. However, the effluent mixture still contains iodide species which causes undesirable reactions unless they are rapidly quenched with special handling techniques. (44) Besides, the formation of carbon oxides was also observed due to the inevitable combustion of hydrocarbons, as well as floating coke on the surface of the melt possibly due to CO disproportionation reaction. (347) Additionally, the presence of water with the molten salts is extremely corrosive and, thus, is intrinsically disadvantageous.

3.4.4 Bi-Halogens Interplay in Propane Dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation to propylene has been extensively explored as an alternative approach to supplement the current propylene production based on steam cracking, fluidic catalytic cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons, and SAPO-34 catalyzed methanol to mixed olefins. (336) Iodine-mediated dehydrogenation generally gives higher propylene yields compared to the conventional dehydrogenation routes. For propane iodination, the radial reactions mechanism is well-established. (46, 337) It is demonstrated that iodine reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to form iodopropane and propylene (the latter formed via dehydroiodination of iodopropane). However, high propylene yields are only thermodynamically favorable at higher temperatures (Figure 43b). Oxidative iodination of propane over molten iodinated salts leads to better yields of propylene, but overoxidation to carbon oxides lowers the feedstock utilization. (44, 346) Recently, Stucky et al. developed a low-temperature route for propane dehydrogenation by using bihalogens (Br2 and I2) as the mediators. (348) Adding a little amount of bromine in the iodination reaction can significantly promote C3H8 conversion and the selectivity of the desired products (Figure 43c). A high yield of C3H6+C3H7X (X = Br and I) up to 80% was attained at moderate reaction temperatures below 800 K. The interplay between Br2 and I2 was believed to be crucial, combining the high reactivity of bromine and high selectivity of iodine. A comparative experiment showed that the direct bromination of C3H8 involved a batch of sequential substitution reactions, leading to inferior selectivity of the desired product. The addition of iodine into the bromination process accelerated the formation of C3H6 by reducing the main side-reaction from 2-C3H7Br to 2,2-C3H6Br2. 4 Transformation of Alkyl Halides to Chemicals and Fuels In the modern chemical industry, alcohols, especially methanol, are important platform molecules, which can be transformed into a spectrum of valuable chemicals such as aldehydes, acetates, olefins, aromatics, etc. Likewise, haloalkanes can also be viewed as alternative building blocks for a broad range of specialty chemicals. Thus, efficient transformation of haloalkanes to valuable chemicals and fuels is as important as their synthesis from alkanes [via the (oxy)halogenation chemistry (sections 3.13.3)] in the halogen-mediated alkane upgrading chain. Different technologies for alkyl halides conversion have been discovered (Figure 44). Among them, high-temperature pyrolysis represents one of the oldest routes from alkyl halides to different hydrocarbons, including olefins, VCM, and aromatics. (52, 352, 353) The developed processes based on pyrolysis are all noncatalytic, yielding a broad range of products, which leads to cost-intensive separation steps. Besides, it suffers from carbonaceous deposits in the pyrolysis reaction. A more advanced technology of methyl halides coupling over aluminosilicate molecular sieves was discovered by the Mobil scientists. (50) These reactions occur in a low-temperature range of 553753 K, operating both in batch and continuous modes. (50, 310, 354) By tuning the topology and acidity of various zeolites, this route can be designed for the on-purpose production of gasolines, olefins, and aromatics. (355-358) Additionally, alkyl halides can be converted to oxygenates by hydrolysis or carbonylation. (54, 60, 263, 359) In this section, the above-mentioned technologies for alkyl halides conversion will be reviewed, with the emphasis on the recent advances on methyl halides transformation and the differences with respect to the MTH route. The toxicity and safe handling of halogenated compounds will also be discussed.

4.1 Methyl Halides to Hydrocarbons
Catalytic coupling of methyl halides to various hydrocarbon products signifies one of the most promising technologies for the upgrading of halogenated methane. Zeolite materials hold utmost importance in these transformations. In the sections below, the major factors influencing the catalytic performance and the proposed reaction mechanisms of respective zeolites will be discussed.
4.1.1 Zeolite Catalysts
Catalytic conversion of methyl halides to higher hydrocarbons via coupling over different zeolites has been extensively studied. The performance with respect to activity, product distribution, catalyst lifetime, and coke deposition is closely associated with the properties of a catalyst, of which the topology and acidity have been revealed to be highly relevant. However, it should be stressed that for zeolites with different compositions, the influence of topology and acidity are interconnected, which makes it even difficult to determine the specific role of each factor. In addition, the feed impurities as well as reaction conditions exert an impact on the catalyst performance.
Impact of Topology The topology impact of various protonic zeolites on the methyl chloride coupling reaction have been studied by different groups, regardless of the potential influence of different acidity arising from the coordination and Si/Al ratio. (362-364) Juamain and Su compared the catalytic performance of Y, Beta, and ZSM-5 catalysts and revealed that the pore size of the zeolites was decisive to the reaction. (364) While large pore zeolites (Y and Beta) showed appreciable conversions, carbonaceous deposits were severe due to the relatively large cages or channels of zeolites. ZSM-5 with medium pore size, on the other hand, demonstrated high CH3Cl conversion rate and more distinctively prolonged stability with strong reduction in coke formation. These findings agree with the study by Liu et al., who reported a more general comparison of the performance for the chloromethane conversion over 8 different types of zeolites. (363) They concluded that gasoline-rich products predominated over silicaalumina zeolites while SAPOs molecular sieves showed higher selectivity to light olefins, especially for the SAPO-34 upon which the total selectivity of C2H4 plus C3H6 exceeded 56% (Table 7). Generally, the apparent differences in the selectivity and coke deposition of different zeolites can be partly interpreted by steric effect of cavities. As is well-known, the coupling reaction intermediates can be formed and even captured in these motifs, which might serve as the precursors to the releasing products or coke. For instance, Shen et al. demonstrated that at the initial stage of the reaction long chain alkanes were the main carbon species trapped in ZSM-22 while polymethylated benzenes and methylnaphthalene overwhelmed in SAPO-34. (362) This is interpreted by the bigger interior diameter of the CHA cage in SAPO-34 (ca.12.7 × 0.94 nm) than in ZSM-22 (0.46 × 0.57 nm). Experimental results revealed that SAPO-34 surpassed ZSM-22 with a higher activity and total selectivity to light olefins but was more prone to coking under equivalent conditions. However, it is difficult to draw any conclusion about the effect of topology at this stage since the influence of other factors has not been excluded. Building the correlation between the zeolite topology structure and the performance (especially selectivity and coking), though challenging, will be an important step toward rational catalyst design in this field.

Impact of Acidity Zeolitic materials are rich in acid chemistry, which in turn could exert a great impact on the catalytic performance. Both Brnsted and Lewis acid sites can act as the active centers in CH3X coupling. Thus, the manipulation of the acidity of zeolites has been used as one of the most effective methods to improve the catalyst performance.
Si/Al Ratio The acid properties (types, strength, and total amount) can be well-tuned by varying the Si/Al ratio during the synthesis with intended feeding or occasionally by dealuminization or desilication with the introduction of different anions. It has been revealed that an increase in the Si/Al ratio in H-ZSM-5 and Mg-ZSM-5 leads to a decrease in the total acidity, as measured by NH3-TPD (Figure 45, panels ac). (355, 365) The number of weak acid sites apparently decreased with the decreasing acidity, as revealed by deconvolution of the desorption profiles. (365) Pyridine FTIR further demonstrated the decreasing Brnsted/Lewis site ratio with increasing Si/Al ratio in protonic zeolite. (355) Consequently, the catalyst performance in CH3Cl coupling showed decreased activity with the increase in Si/Al ratio, whereas the selectivity to light olefins (especially propene) was enhanced (Figure 45e). (355, 366) However, Mg-ZSM-5 with a high Si/Al ratio of 360 showed superior stability in CH3Br coupling reaction compared with those with low ratios (Figure 45d). Anion modification of ZSM-5 could also be used to improve the catalyst performance, especially for increasing the selectivity of light olefins. For instance, introducing P on Mg-ZSM-5 led to an increased C3H6 selectivity (60% versus 50%) and improved stability. (367)27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study indicated that the dealuminization in the zeolites framework due to the modification of P reduced the strong Brnsted acid sites, which should be responsible for the relatively high C3H6 selectivity. Recently, Wang et al. reported a fluoride-treated HZSM-5 as highly selective catalysts for C3H6 production. Instead of incorporation into the zeolite framework, the fluoride ions caused desilication of the zeolite (presumably defective Si). (358) It was concluded that fluoride treatments led to weaker acidity and enlarged micropores (0.730.78 nm), the latter being beneficial for the formation of penta- and hexa-methylbenzenes, the presumed precursors for C3H6 generation in hydrocarbon pool mechanism.

Metal Cation Incorporation Modification of H-type ZSM-5 or SAPO zeolites with mono-, di-, and trivalent cations can strongly influence the catalytic performance (activity, selectivity, and lifetime) in methyl halide coupling reactions. (357, 361, 369-371) Results from alkali metal-modified ZSM-5 showed that the reactivity decreased in the order of Li-ZSM-5 > Na-ZSM-5 > K-ZSM-5 > Cs-ZSM-5, indicating that a high Lewis acidity of the counterion might be beneficial for the reaction. (369) A comparative study between various transition and alkaline earth metal-exchanged ZSM-5 revealed that the transition metal (Mn, Fe, and Co) exchanged zeolites showed higher activity and relatively high selectivity to olefins (X(CH3Cl) > 90%, S(olefins) > 30%, T = 698 K), while Mg-exchanged catalyst exhibited the best stability among the alkaline metal-exchanged catalysts, with a total conversion under the same reaction conditions (Figure 45h). (361) Compared to the other catalysts, the Mg-modified zeolite showed the lowest amount of C9+ aromatics which was speculated to affect the catalyst lifetime. The influence on acidity due to the cation modification was probed with NH3-TPD (Figure 45g). Compared to H-ZSM-5, the strong acid sites featured by the desorption centered at ca. 610 K decreased for alkaline cation-modified zeolites, while the weak acid sites remained stable. Additional strong acid sites, likely of Lewis type, were created after the treatment. Sun et al. indicated that the incorporated Mg might exist as Mg2+ and/or Mg(OH)+, serving as new active sites for CH3Cl conversion. (367) Zhou et al. further proposed that the interactions between Mg2+ and the zeolite framework might be dependent on the Si/Al ratio (Figure 45f). (365) Namely, Mg2+ preferentially interacted with the acidic bridging hydroxyl groups in ZSM-5 with a low Si/Al ratio, forming Mg(OH)+, and in high silica zeolite, the acidity may come from the surface OH groups of MgOH.
Incorporation of transition or alkaline earth metals has also been used in the modification of SAPO-34 catalysts. (357, 370-372) Liu et al. reported a general improvement in the catalyst stability and selectivity to light olefins over Mn-, Fe-, and Co-modified systems. (357, 370) Similar effects were also confirmed for Mg-SAPO-34, upon which C2H4 and C3H6 were the main products (a total selectivity of ca. 80%). (371) It was concluded that the doping of the molecular sieve with these cations can facilitate the formation of Si islands, decreasing the acidity on one hand and slowing down hydrogen transfer reaction on the other hand, both of which contribute to the improved catalytic performance.
Impact of Feed Impurities The methane (oxy)halogenation reactions produce appreciable amounts of overhalogenated byproducts, especially the dihalogenated compounds. From the viewpoint of an industrial process from methane to hydrocarbons, it is of interest to elucidate the possibility of cofeeding the byproducts into a coupling reactor. This can greatly simplify the process by eliminating the tedious separation and purification of halogenated compounds. Theoretically, the addition of higher halogenated methane (H:C  2) will lead to an increasing propensity for the formation of aromatics. This is understandable considering that the H:C ratio in the products is shifted below 2 when all the halogens end up as hydrogen halides. Lorkovic et al. observed a significant buildup of adsorbed carbons and aromatics over CaO/ZSM-5 when the effluent of the gas-phase bromination reaction was fed into a second cascade catalyst bed. (278) It was hypothesized that the adsorbed carbons were formed predominantly by CH2Br2 condensation while cross coupling between CH3Br and CH2Br2 led to higher selectivity of aromatics. The detrimental effect of CH2Cl2 on CH3Cl coupling reaction over SAPO-34 crystals has been reported by Olsbye et al. (373) Like in the case of bromomethanes coupling reactions, the addition of CH2Cl2 promoted the formation of aromatics and caused rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition. Isotopic-labeling experiments showed that CH2Cl2 can be incorporated into methylbenzene reaction intermediates and form the gas phase products via the hydrocarbon pool mechanism. These results suggest that separation of (oxy)halogenation products is indispensable for the zeolite-based upgrading route.
Impact of Coke Coke deposition over zeolites is commonly observed in the coupling of methyl halides. It is generally acknowledged that heavy coking will affect mass transfer by blocking the pores or poison the active sites, thus it is responsible for catalyst deactivation. However, the intrinsic impact of coking might be more complex considering the facts: (i) there is an induction period when activity buildup and product variation are observed with fast coke deposition (355, 360) and (ii) stable catalyst performance of several to hundreds of hours have been reported for zeolites with heavy coke depositions. (355, 365) A study of CH3Cl coupling by pulse experiments on precoked SAPO-34 zeolites revealed that the fresh catalyst was least active and selective, and the best performed catalyst seemed to have a maximal coke amount of 2.49 wt % (Figure 45i). (368) Analyzing the trapped carbonaceous species in the zeolites points to the accumulation of multimethyl-substituted benzene and naphthalene with highly coking catalysts, in line with the steady-state results. (365, 368) As proposed by different research groups, both gaseous products and cokes are formed from these trapped species. (360, 368, 373) In this sense, a highly active catalyst could be unfortunately most prone to deactivation. As a matter of fact, the commercial methanol-to-olefins (MTO) reactions are conducted over catalysts with an optimal operation window of coke content of ca. 8%. (374) Therefore, instead of avoiding the coke deposition on zeolites, much effort on methyl halide coupling should be directed on process and operational aspects such as fluidized-bed reactor technologies and continuous catalyst regeneration.
Methyl Halides versus Methanol Methyl halide has a similar chemical structure as methanol. Results from coupling reactions of these methylating agents demonstrated similar reaction patterns in terms of product distribution (Figure 46). (60, 354, 359) However, the different functional groups bring diversities in terms of reactivity, nature of the leaving group, and toxicity. All these aspects have to be considered at the microlevel (catalyst design), mesolevel (reactor modeling), and macrolevel (process considerations). As shown in Table 8, cleaving a CX (X = Cl or Br) bond is thermodynamically more favorable than in the case of COH, reflecting the higher stability of the leaving group. However, Olsbye et al. found that the reactivity of these chemical species over H-SAPO-34 to follow quite an opposite trend with methanol being the most reactive and methyl bromide the least, in agreement with previous studies (Figure 46). (354) They claim that this is due to the lower proton affinity of the methyl halide molecules with respect to methanol (647 kJ mol1 for CH3Cl vs 754 kJ mol1 for CH3OH), leading to a lower coverage of the active sites. (356) In addition, the presence of HX represents a net difference with respect to the MTH process, where water is the main byproduct. The alteration of the catalyst structure has been observed in different zeolite materials exposed to HCl. During methyl chloride conversion over H-SAPO-34, Su et al. confirmed that HCl can strongly interact with the catalyst and cause the reversible rupture of SiOAl and AlOP bonds. (357) Castao et al. studied methyl chloride conversion over H-ZSM-5 and concluded that the presence of HCl in the reaction medium led to the irreversible dealumination of the zeolite and the formation of extra-framework AlCl3. (360) Lersch and Bandermann demonstrated that Fe and Cu exchanged ZSM-5 suffered from leaching due to the formation of volatile metal (oxy)chlorides. (361) The above examples ambiguously point to the different chemistry involved between the transformations of methanol and methyl halides. Undoubtedly, the presence of halides in the upgrading technologies poses new challenges regarding catalyst, reactor, and process design.

4.1.2 Reaction Mechanism
The reaction mechanism of methyl halides/methanol coupling over zeolites has not been well-understood. (68, 375) On the basis of the analogous molecular structures between methyl halides and CH3OH, and similar reaction patterns (especially the product distribution), the general reaction steps for the coupling of methyl halides were suggested to follow the same route as that of CH3OH conversion. (367, 376, 377) Light olefins are suggested to be the primary products that underdo oligomerization to form higher alkenes. Further steps by hydrogen transfer or cracking lead to a spectrum of products such as parafins, olefins, and aromatics. Of particular importance in these steps is the formation of the first CC bond, for which various mechanisms have been proposed, such as carbene, carbocationic, free radical, hydrocarbon pool, and oxonium ylide. (357, 367, 377-380) Nevertheless, considering the different leaving groups between methyl halide and CH3OH, some of the developed reaction mechanism involving the formation of methoxy functionalities might not be directly applicable to the transformation of methyl halides.
Mechanistic study on methyl halide coupling is mainly centered at CH3Cl, and different reaction mechanisms have been proposed with the aids of in situ NMR or FTIR techniques. The first CC linking via an alkoxy-ylide route (Figure 47a) has been proposed by Haw et al. based on the NMR study of Cs-X. (377) In this mechanism, a framework-bound methoxy intermediate was formed by the nucleophilic attack of Brnsted acid sites in the first step. The methoxy species were assumed to be sufficiently acidic to deprotonation, forming a sort of ylide stabilized by the framework. After methylation with a second methyl halide molecule, framework-bound ethoxy intermediates were formed. An elimination step of a C2H4 molecule from ethoxy groups would regenerate the Brnsted acid sites. Csernyi et al. studied the adsorption of CH3Cl on ZSM-5 and Mo2C/ZSM-5 by temperature-programmed desorption and FTIR techniques and came up with a carbene route. (380) In this mechanism, they proposed that carbene species can be released from and inserted into the surface-bound methoxy groups to initiate the carbon chain propagation. These reaction mechanisms do not specify the role of a metal cation, but they are at least partially supported by the fact that the framework-bound methoxy species have been frequently detected on the zeolites saturated with CH3Cl. (369, 380) Figure 47 Figure 47. Schematic representation of the methyl halides coupling mechanism over different zeolite catalysts.

As it has been discussed above, the reactivity of methyl halide coupling can be strongly influenced by the modification with different metal cations. This indicates that the dopants should participate in the activation of the reactants. Elaboration of the previous alkoxy-ylide route with the explicit roles of metal cations in the key steps of hydrocarbon synthesis is presented in Figure 47b. (381) In the first step, CH3X was activated by Lewis acid sites of a metal cation, forming a framework-bound methoxy species. Instead of releasing free carbene species, a negatively charged CH2 species was generated by the deprotonation of methoxy groups and stabilized by the framework and metal cation ions. The first CC linkage was completed by the attack of CH3X on the framework-bound CH2 species (variously described as a stabilized carbene or carbanion). In accordance with the mechanism, species derived from the cations act both as a Lewis acid in the elimination of the halide leaving groups and as a base in the formation of stabilized carbene species. The Lewis acidity of metal cations is generally accepted to play a role in CH3X coupling. However, there is no evidence demonstrating the formation of framework-bound species. Therefore, the initial carbon chain growth step is highly controversial. Sun et al. argued that the first CC bond was derived from the addition of carbene species to a surface methoxy group, (367) while Jaumain and Su debated that a carbene transfer between neighboring methoxy groups might be responsible for the first CC linkage. (364, 369) Hydrocarbon pool concept was initially proposed to explain the phenomenon observed in the MTO reaction where the other reaction mechanisms failed to elucidate the chain growth of products. (382) The hydrocarbon pool can be described as a catalytic scaffold, constituted by large organics adsorbed in the zeolite, to which methanol is added and olefins are eliminated in a closed catalytic cycle. (383) Liu et al. suggested that the transformation of CH3Cl to hydrocarbons upon SAPO-34 crystals followed this pattern. (357, 384) On the basis of in situ infrared spectroscopic studies, four different surface adsorbed species, as shown in Figure 47c, have been identified. A surface-bound ethoxy group (adsorption III) was suggested to be formed by the interactions between adsorbed HCl (adsorption II) and polymethylbenzenes in the cage, albeit how the migration occurs is rather unclear. In addition, surface-bound polymerized alkene species (adsorption IV) were detected on the zeolite with a high coverage of the reactant, which might be responsible for the formation of higher olefins or cokes.
4.2 Methyl Halides to Oxygenates
The conversion of methyl halides to oxygenates offers another attractive route for methyl halide upgrading. It is of interest because the aimed-products are of high values and can be easily transported. The major transformation technologies are based on catalyzed hydrolysis or carbonylation reactions.
4.2.1 Hydrolysis
Methyl halides can be further converted to valuable oxygenates such as methanol and dimethyl ether by hydrolysis. Olah et al. first reported the catalytic hydrolysis of methyl chloride/bromide with steam in a continuous flow reactor over γ-Al2O3. Methanol and dimethyl ether were the only products at 1323% conversions at 648 K. (54, 263) An effort was made to improve catalyst activity by modifying γ-Al2O3 with different metal oxides and metal hydroxides. Only a moderate effect was observed, with the highest conversion of 25% obtained upon ZnO/Al(OH)3/γ-Al2O3. (263) In addition, catalyst deactivation and leaching of metal components occurred in the course of the reaction because of the formation of metal halides on the catalyst surface. More efficient catalysts have been discovered in the past decade, operating in a batch reactor. (59, 385, 386) Zhou et al. reported the hydrolysis of CH3Br to methanol and DME over a homogeneous RuCl3 catalyst [X(CH3Br) = 6698%, 423453 K]. (59) Increasing reaction time favors DME yield arising from the dehydration of methanol. Disadvantageously, water was used as the solvent in this reaction, and thus the separation of the catalyst from reaction products could be problematic. An even more robust heterogeneous catalyst, poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PVP), was shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of CH3Br to a mixture of CH3OH and DME at low temperatures of 323398 K [X(CH3Br) = 5289%], using water as the solvent. (385) Notably, the catalyst can be easily separated and recycled after simply washing with dichloromethane and water. No obvious drop in catalyst performance was observed in five consecutive cycles. Furthermore, when replacing the water solvent with CH3OH, DME was the only hydrolysis product [X(CH3Br) = 2435%, T = 373398 K]. (386)
4.2.2 Carbonylation
Carbonylation of methyl halides with CO over RhCl3-based homogeneous catalysts produces acetyl halides that can readily undergo hydrolysis in the presence of water, leading to the formation of acetic acid exclusively. (60, 359) Zhou et al. studied the carbonylation of CH3Br to acetic acid over RhCl3-PPh3-KI (PPh3, triphenylphosphine) catalysts (yield >99%, T = 423 K, P = 26 bar), well-known for the homogeneous methanol carbonylation reaction. (60) Using the same catalyst recipe, Bao et al. confirmed the feasibility of CH3Cl carbonylation to acetic acid under similar conditions. (359) The role of promoters is crucial for these reactions, and the highest activity was only obtained in the presence of cocatalysts PPh3 and KI. These observations are in line with the findings in Rh-catalyzed methanol carbonylation, revealing that the rate-determining step in the carbonylation cycle is the oxidative addition of CH3I to [Rh(CO)2I2]1 to a rhodium-methyl complex which can be accelerated by increasing the electron density at the Rh center by coordination of phosphine ligands. (387) Likewise, it is reasonable to speculate that the carbonylation of methyl halides over Rh catalysts followed a similar mechanism with the methanol carbonylation reaction. However, CH3Br showed much superior carbonylation reactivity to CH3Cl (TOF of 1.1 × 103 s1 for CH3Cl and 12.7 × 103 s1 for CH3Br), (60, 359) which can be explained by the difference of CX bond energy in CH3X (Table 8).
4.3 Transformation of Other Haloalkanes
Due to the lack of selectivity, a spectrum of haloalkanes can be produced during the (oxy)halogenation of a hydrocarbon compound. Most of these side products, however, do not have a stable market. With an additional process, the alkyl halides can be transformed into value-added commodities.
4.3.1 Polyhalomethanes
Polyhalomethanes are formed in a substantial amount in methane halogenation reactions. It is of interest to develop new catalysts and routes to further convert them into useful chemicals. A novel process was discovered by Stauffer for the direct production of VCM via coactivation of CH3Cl and CH2Cl2 (eq 20). (173) This endothermic reaction is thermodynamically favorable and essentially goes to completion at relevant temperatures (573773 K) over a catalyst such as ZnCl2 supported on alumina or zeolites. More recently, Rabiu and Yusuf conceived a new process for olefins-rich hydrocarbon synthesis from di- and trichloromethanes over an iron-based FischerTropsch catalyst, Fe/Al2O3/Cu, operating in a moving bed reactor under the industrially relevant conditions. (388) However, no experimental details were disclosed regarding the activity and selectivity. Besides, the catalysts used were rather fragile in the presence of the chlorine-rich environment. Phase transformation of reduced Fe crystallites into iron chlorides and probably FeOCl is inevitable and calls for an additional catalyst regeneration step.
(20) Methylene bromide is the primary side product in the gas-phase methane bromination reaction. Several novel routes have been developed concerning the transformation of CH2Br2 into useful commodities. For instance, Prakash et al. demonstrated that CH2Br2, when hydrolyzed in the presence of methanol, can be efficiently and selectively converted to dimethoxymethane (DMM), over a basic solid catalyst, poly(4-vinylpyridine), under mild conditions [X(CH2Br2) = 58%, S(DMM) = 100%, 398 K]. (386) Stucky et al. reported several catalytic systems for the hydrodebromination and oligomerization of CH2Br2. (389) Among the catalysts screened, Pd6C/SiO2 showed a high selectivity for the conversion of CH2Br2 to higher hydrocarbons rich in light olefins, and Ru/SiO2 gave the highest selectivity to CH3Br (Figure 48, panels ac). Besides, cofeeding of HBr with CH2Br2/H2 over Ru-based catalysts showed the promotional effect on the enhanced selectivity of CH3Br (96%), whereas CH4, C2+, and coke formations were all suppressed. Thus, this can be a promising step to consume the CH2Br2 produced in methane bromination routes. Another method was demonstrated by the same authors via an iodine-catalyzed gas phase reaction between propane and CH2Br2 in the presence of a substantial amount of HBr to produce C3H6 and CH3Br. (390) By optimizing the reaction parameters, a high single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7Br+C3H7I and CH3Br up to 80% and 74%, respectively, was achieved simultaneously with a residence time of 16 s at 798 K (Figure 48d). It is noteworthy that the conversions of both CH2Br2 and C3H8 are highly dependent on the addition of iodine. A reaction route was proposed wherein iodine mainly abstracts bromine out of CH2Br2, while bromine radicals contribute to the activation of C3H8 in dehydrogenation (Figure 48e). Albeit the novelty and high efficiency in the coactivation of CH2Br2 and C3H8, the elemental iodine employed cannot be retained in the reactor and a recovery process might be required.

The activation of dibromomethane and propane are highlighted toward CH3Br and C3H6 (both in bold). (390) Adapted from refs 389 and 390. Copyright 2012 American Chemical Society.
4.3.2 Ethyl Halides
Ethyl halides are formed as the primary products in the ethane oxyhalogenation reactions, although they can be instantaneously converted to VCM or C2H4 at elevated temperatures (vide supra). Several novel routes have been developed regarding the further upgrading of ethyl halides. Among them, dehydrohalogenation has been found to be an effective way to prepare ethylene. For instance, dehydrochlorination of ethyl chloride over a sulfated fiber glass-supported platinum catalyst (0.02%Pt-SO4/Zr-Si) showed a C2H4 selectivity of 94% at a C2H5Cl conversion of 25% at 723 K. (188) Dehydrobromination of ethyl bromide can occur even more readily. The 12%ZnO2-SiO2 catalyst prepared by the solgel method showed 70100% conversion, with ethylene as the only product at 473573 K. (62) Alternatively, hydrolysis can be applied to the transformation of ethyl bromide into oxygenates. In an integrated process for ethane bromination, McFarland et al. directed the bromination effluents comprising mainly of ethyl bromide together with dibromoethane into different mixed metal oxide catalysts. (57) Valuable products such as ethanol and diethyl ether with a total selectivity of 65% were obtained over a Co3O4-Sm2O3-ZrO2 catalyst at 473 K.
4.4 Toxicity and Safe Handling of Halogen-Containing Compounds
Halogens have been extensively employed in numerous important industrial processes, such as chloroform (37) and polymer (72) manufactures, and they are expected to play a bigger role in the future for the development of the modern chemical society. As it has been mentioned in previous sections, this topic has been gaining increasing attention since the past decade because of the great potential for the valorization of light hydrocarbons. (69) However, the R&D in academia are still relatively skeptical likely due to the notorious reputation of halogenated chemicals and the lack of knowledge on safe handling. Thus, it is highly desirable to well-understand the potential harms of related reaction intermediates/byproducts and elaborate precautions in order to maintain environmental and personnel safety. Halocarbons are diverse in their properties, and the reaction intermediates differ from one reaction to another, making generalization difficult. In the sections below, a general discussion on safety issues will be presented from the aspects of corrosiveness, flammability, and toxicity. The potential harms of halogen-containing compounds of relevant interest in this review are summarized in Table 9.
Table 9. Summary of Potential Harms of Halogen-Containing Compounds Table aTemperature listed below corresponds to the flash point of respective compounds.
Table bToxicity level is classified according to International Agency for Research on Cancer: Group 1, carcinogenic to humans; Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans, Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans, Group 3, not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans. (391) Table cGHS pictograms indicate vividly several serious hazards of chemicals; the meanings of each can be referred to in ref 392.
Table dToxicity level is classified according to United States Environmental Protection Agency: Group C, possible human carcinogen; Group D, not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity.
4.4.1 Inorganic Halides
Hydrogen halides, both reactants and byproducts in (oxy)halogenation reactions, are among the most common chemicals encountered in halogen chemistry. They may be used as gases or aqueous solutions. In both cases, they should be handled with great care. The gaseous hydrogen halides are not combustible but toxic if inhaled and might cause respiratory irritation. When dissolved in water, they are known as hydrohalic acids. All these acids are dangerous and belong to strong chemical acids except HF. Being extremely corrosive, direct skin contact will cause severe skin burns and eye damage and thus should be strictly avoided. Halogens are generally toxic or even lethal to biological organisms in their elemental forms, and they tend to decrease in toxicity toward the heavier halogens. Chlorine gas is highly toxic, while bromine and iodine are somewhat toxic, being able to irritate the lungs and eyes. They are not classifiable as a human carcinogen. However, all routes of exposure by means of inhalation, skin, and eye contact should be refrained. Chronic exposure could cause serious respiratory effects such as eye and throat irritation and airflow obstruction. Phosgene, in contrast to the irritant halogens, is an insidious poison because the odor may not be noticed and symptoms may be slow to appear. (393) However, it is extremely toxic by acute inhalation exposure. Furthermore, as a strong electrophilic reactant, phosgene can react easily with water to produce highly corrosive HCl.
4.4.2 Halocarbons
Halocarbons occur in nature as well as are synthesized in the laboratory. They generally resemble the parent alkanes in being colorless, relatively odorless, and hydrophobic. Their boiling points are higher than the corresponding alkanes and scale with the atomic weight and number of halides. They are used as flame retardants, fire extinguisher, refrigerants, propellants, solvents, and pharmaceuticals. (394) Subsequent to the widespread use in commerce, many halocarbons have also been shown to be serious pollutants and toxins. Haloalkanes are generally insoluble in water and regarded as much less corrosive when compared with inorganic hydrohalic acids. However, water-incompatible halogen-containing compounds such as acetyl halides are highly corrosive, and hydrolysis reaction can occur readily with the formation of hydrohalic acids. (60) Flammability is another big issue for haloalkanes. It is inappropriate to consider that all alkyl halides are nonflammable. In fact, most of them have relatively low flash points, and some intermediates (e.g., VCM), are extremely flammable. Noncombustible alkyl halides are only restricted to polyhalogenated compounds with substitution of multiple halogens such as CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, and CH2Br2. The biggest concern for these alkyl halides is their toxicity. Some problematic aspects include carcinogenicity and liver damage. Under certain conditions, phosgene can be formed by combustion of certain intermediates (e.g., VCM, 1,1-dichloroethane, etc.), which is highly toxic. Although few alkyl halides are acutely toxic, many pose risks from prolonged exposure. Among these some have been identified as carcinogenic (e.g., VCM and 1,2-dichlopropane), while most of the others are classified as possibly carcinogenic due to inadequate evidence in humans (CH2Cl2, CHCl3, CCl4, C2Cl4, C2Cl6, EDC, etc.). Therefore, inhalation should be avoided as much as possible in all circumstances.
4.4.3 Safe Handling
Smooth operations of halogenation reactions in a laboratory scale should emphasize strict operation procedures, sufficient personal safety protections, and proper waste treatments. Experience from our lab encourages conducting these experiments in fume hoods with good air ventilation and with installation of gas alarms equipped with a halogen gas detector in case of any emergent leakage of toxic gases. The reactor in the lab is usually made of quartz to withstand high-temperature and severe corrosion ambiences. For those reactions with the formation of water, Teflon pipes are recommended for the downstream of the reactor, as even a trace of moisture will aggressively accelerate corrosion and increase susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of pipelines. The staff should always wear safety goggles and antiacid gloves when running the reactions. In case of emergency situations, gas masks will help protect from irritations by inhalation. Last but not least, the chemical wastes are generally highly acidic and rich in halogens, and a neutralization step with a diluted basic solution should be performed before dumping. The experience accumulated in a lab might be cautiously extrapolated to the large-scale productions in industry where the potential harm of haloalkanes should be foreseen and guarded with a contingency plan.
4.4.4 Materials of ConstructionIn chemical industry, corrosion is a major issue, quite often leading to shutdowns of plants and high maintenance costs. While internal corrosion results in contamination of products and process streams, external corrosion leaks compromise safety causing undesirable personnel and environmental risks. Therefore, the successful development of a process, especially when halogens are involved, depends on finding suitable materials of construction. Today, owing to a tremendous progress in metallurgy and corrosion science, different materials, including metals, alloys, ceramics, graphite, silicon carbide, glasses, polymers, etc, have been widely used for the construction of reactors, vessels, columns, heat exchangers, pumps, and piping under various conditions to handle corrosive halogens.Knowledge accumulated from theoretical study and industrial practice is rich on the corrosion behaviors of metals/alloys and protections from chlorine/chloride attacks. Equipment fabricated from iron, steel, nickel, copper, and lead can be safely used to handle dry chlorine (gaseous and liquid). (395, 396) However, the corrosion rate can be accelerated at elevated temperatures. For instance, carbon steel should not be used when operation temperature reaches above 390 K. (396) Under more demanding conditions, nickel and high nickel alloys are the better choices when higher temperatures are required (up to 813 K). (397) Titanium, which reacts violently with dry chlorine, should never be used in any circumstances. Dry chlorine has an extremely high affinity for moisture, whose presence will rapidly increase the corrosion rate for common metals of construction. In this case, platinum and tantalum are some of the metals resistant to moist chlorine. Titanium can also be used because the strongly oxidizing nature of moist chlorine results in passivation of the metal. The performance of metal/alloys in dry HCl is somewhat analogous to their behaviors in dry chlorine. Wet hydrogen chloride at temperatures below the dew point behaves the same as concentrated hydrochloric acid, and Hastelloy C is the most resistant nickel alloy. The effect of moisture in HCl at elevated temperatures has been reported for a number of materials such as carbon steel, nickel, Hastelloy B, and the results showed that a moisture content of 0.25% did not significantly alter the corrosion rate. (397) For a chemical process, the presence of halogens poses a big challenge to reactor design in order to meet stringent requirements induced by high temperatures and pressures, as well as complicated chemical reactions. Thus, material selection as the first step is vital. Experience from PVC manufacture shows that (i) carbon steel is adequate for low-temperature ethylene chlorination (T < 373 K) though nickel-based nonferrous alloys are often preferred, (398) (ii) stainless steel vessels are more frequently used in both high-temperature ethylene chlorination and acetylene hydrochlorination, and (iii) stainless steel and tantalum are suitable construction materials for the ethylene oxychlorination reactor. (399) Like chlorine, bromine attacks many of the metals and alloys commonly used as materials of construction, which is strongly dependent on the conditions of service including temperature, pressure, and moisture content. Nickel, lead, and alloys such as Monel and Hastelloy can be used for handling dry bromine. (400) These materials, however, are all susceptible to severe attack in the presence of moisture. Tantalum is rather resistant to wet bromine (>30 ppm of H2O) and is often used for the heat exchange surface. In contrast, Hastelloy and Monel can be used if the bromine contains less than 30 ppm water, and Inconel can be used when bromine is essentially dry (<1 ppm of H2O). (401) Early patents revealed that reactors constructed with refractory or zirconia lining are suitable for HBr oxidation, (402) and a refractory alumina lining reactor can withstand gas-phase bromination up to 1173 K without significant corrosion. (403) Besides, nonmetallic glass and plastics are usable in a wide range of conditions. Glass-lined reactors are frequently used for brominations, given that the operating pressure is limited to 10 bar. (401) Low price plastic materials such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) have now become available and in many cases can be readily used to replace expensive lead-lined pipes and tanks. (404) Construction of equipment and piping by common metals such as nickel, copper, alumina, magnesium, Monel, and even steel can be used to successfully handle fluorine. (405) Among these materials, nickel and Monel are equally resistant and outperform the others. Nickel, copper, and Monel also show good resistance to anhydrous HF even at elevated concentrations and temperatures. It is claimed that the presence of steam did not accelerate the corrosion rate at 773873 K. (405) Steel equipment might be suitable for handling HF under relatively anhydrous conditions considering that they are satisfactorily applied in the production of HF from fluorspar at ca. 450 K. (406) With respect to hydrofluoric acid, Monel is more universally applicable over a wide range of temperatures. Lead is also widely employed for the preparation and commercial handling of hydrofluoric acid up to 60% strength, whereas it fails rapidly at higher concentrations and at elevated temperatures. (407) The corrosion data of materials attacked by iodine is limited compared to those of other halogens. Hastelloy B and C-276 have been demonstrated to be resistant to corrosion in an HI/I2 environment in the absence of moisture. (408) A number of engineering alloys and corrosion resistant materials have been screened in a HI/I2/H2O environment at 473673 K. It is found that tantalum, zirconium, titanium, SiC, and SiN showed very low corrosion rates at all temperatures. (409) On the other hand, tantalum, niobium, molybdenum, zirconium, SiC, and carbon-based materials have the best prospect in lower temperatures (T < 473 K). (410) 5 Conclusions and Outlook Halogen-mediated processes have emerged as very prominent technologies in the chemical industry for the production of polymers and have been showing a great potential to revolutionize the chemical value chain by capitalizing on the abundant natural gas reserves. The key aspect of halogens making them effective mediators under mild conditions is their high electron affinities for the hydrogen abstraction from a hydrocarbon molecule that weakens in the order of Cl > F > Br > I. The past decades have witnessed the renaissance of halogen chemistry. Promising catalytic technologies have been conceived for the utilization of low-cost hydrocarbon feedstocks for the production of polymers, chemicals, and fuels. However, pertaining challenges remain to be solved regarding the design of more selective and stable catalysts, the construction of suitable reactors with well heat, corrosion management, and process engineering. Herein, in-depth analysis of the fundamental understanding and applied relevance of halogen chemistry in polymer industry and in the valorization of light hydrocarbons to chemicals and fuels is conducted.The modern VCM manufacture technologies heavily rely on the HgCl2-catalyzed acetylene hydrochlorination and ethylene-based two-step routes. These industrially applied processes are suboptimal due to the use of relatively expensive feedstocks, metal leaching, and pollution problems of the catalysts. Gold-based catalysts have demonstrated to be promising to replace the oldest recipe for the hydrochlorination. Reducing the gold loading to an economical level while keeping an appreciable productivity on long-term is a challenging next step. Even more intriguing is to find new catalysts based on cheaper and nontoxic metals which not only will enable the expansion but also will reduce the environmental impact of this process. Direct oxychlorination of C2H4/C2H6 to VCM is a promising technology to intensify the PVC production. Ethane oxychlorination is especially demanding, and the main obstacle comes from selective VCM formation. Design of multifunctional materials featuring optimal balance between redox and acid properties can be anticipated to address this issue.Selective activation of light alkanes, particularly of methane, still comprises one of the most complex challenges to the catalysis community. Single-step methane halogenation is impracticable either because of the poor selectivity of the gas-phase reaction or the insufficient stability of the super acid catalysts. The drawbacks can be overcome by feeding over stoichiometric CH4:X2 with the recycling of unreacted methane. Even so, this process should always be integrated with a halogen recovery unit, such as HX oxidation over novel Deacon catalysts to recycle HX released in the halogenation and subsequent elimination steps. Alternatively, catalyzed oxyhalogenation processes are more advanced as the hydrocarbon activation and HX recovery can be integrated in one step, with sufficiently high selectivity to methyl halides. However, the presence of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, forming undesired carbon oxides. Several metal oxides and phosphate catalysts have been demonstrated to be sufficiently durable and active in these reactions. The rich phosphate chemistry with numerous compositions and phases provides huge opportunities to further explore more active components in this group of materials. Unprecedented selectivity to light alkenes can be achieved by halogen-aided dehydrogenation of corresponding alkanes. The corrosion and recovery of halogens require sophisticated process and reactor engineering, especially when iodine and water are present in the system.The conversion of haloalkanes, produced via (oxy)halogenation of alkanes, into high value-added commodities is the most important second step in halogen-mediated alkane upgrading technology. Zeolitic materials are the prime candidates studied extensively to catalyze methyl halide coupling to gasolines or light olefins. Compared with the MTH reaction, methyl halides coupling shows inferior activity and stability due to the different leaving groups (X versus OH). These reactions are strongly influenced by the topology and acidity of the catalysts. Therefore, zeolite engineering by turning the topology and composition or by doping strategy is imperative to develop efficient and stable coupling catalysts. Future research should also tackle the impact of halides on the catalyst performance and the structural alteration.In general, to deal with the above-mentioned hurdles in different halogen-mediated technologies, scientists should devote more efforts to the development of sufficiently active and durable catalysts, suitable reactors, and integrated processes. Catalyst design at a molecular level based on deeper understanding of the structure-performance relationship is the key. To achieve this elegant goal, the selection of a suitable catalyst should take into account different hydrocarbon molecules, the applied halogens, as well as the potential impact of halogen on the catalyst structure. Operando techniques enabling in situ detection of reaction intermediate species and structural variation of catalytic materials can provide in-depth understanding of the reaction path. However, these techniques are scarcely applied in halogen-mediated reactions because of the extremely corrosive nature of HX. Microkinetic analysis coupled with DFT studies can be expected to complement this and provide more mechanistic insights.Reactor engineering should tackle the issues of exothermicity and corrosion. The reaction heat is particularly prominent in the oxyhalogenation reactions. Strategies for the fixed-bed technologies including catalyst grading or staging of feed in reactor cascades offer better temperature control. In addition, a fluidized-bed reactor generally has good heat removal capacity and thus can ease the hot spot effect. But in this case, new difficulties arise from the fluidization technology and catalyst stickiness. Materials of construction are demanding for a halogen-mediated process. As susceptibility of materials to attack by halogens is strongly dependent on working conditions, possible candidates selected therefore should be tested under the actual conditions of use. Albeit there have been some demonstrations on halogen-mediated processes in a pilot scale, limited information on metallurgy of reactor materials, their long-term durability, as well as the impact on catalysts, makes it difficult to draw any realistic conclusions for the time being.Providing an integrated process by coupling halogen-related reactions is of vital importance, which represents a giant step toward the commercialization of the developing technologies. This is based on the following considerations: (i) hydrocarbon activation with halogens generally yields alkyl halides instead of ultimate bulk chemicals, thus, a sequential upgrading step is required; (ii) the recovery of halogens is imperative in order to keep the process competitive and sustainable; and (iii) offering a package of technologies enables a reliable assessment of a chemical process. In view of process integration, numerous innovative concepts have been developed. The balanced process in ethylene-to-VCM is intrinsically the combination of ethylene chlorination and oxychlorination, the latter being able to consume the byproduct HCl produced from the former. Zone reactor concept, with different functional catalysts packed in cascades within one reactor, has also been conceived for the one-step transformation of light alkanes to oxygenates or gasolines using bromine as the meditator. These innovative strategies as discussed along the review can provide hints to improve the developing and existing halogen-mediated routes. Thus, joint efforts between the chemists and chemical engineers, as well as collaborations between academia and industry, can be anticipated to greatly accelerate the commercialization and intensification of the halogen-mediated hydrocarbon transformations.Author Information Corresponding Author Javier Prez-Ramrez - Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zurich, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 1, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland;  http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5805-7355;  Email: jpr@chem.ethz.ch Authors Ronghe Lin - Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zurich, Vladimir-Prelog-Weg 1, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland Amol P.
