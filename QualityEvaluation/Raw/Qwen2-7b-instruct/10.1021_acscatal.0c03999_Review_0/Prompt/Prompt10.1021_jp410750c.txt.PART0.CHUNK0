PremjiJohn M. H. Lo*Peter D. Clark View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane was investigated at temperatures between 923 and 1023 K using either O2 or O2/H2S mixture as oxidant. GC analysis of the product mixtures showed that ethylene was the major olefin product in the conventional ODH reaction whereas propylene became dominant when H2S was included in the feed gas. With an oxygen-rich feed (4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S), 70% propane conversion, and 50% propylene selectivity could be achieved at 1023 K, a level of performance comparable to that for the ODH reaction employing reducible solid oxide catalysts. Theoretical calculations utilizing CBS-QB3 method were also conducted to explore the causes of the enhanced propylene yield and selectivity of the H2S-assisted ODH reaction. It was found that the increased propane conversion was due to a large enthalpy gain from the in situ formation of S2 that compensated for the high energy cost of hydrogen abstraction by SH and S2H. Also, the promoted propylene selectivity was attributed to the instability of the sulfur-containing products, which made the reaction route to propylene the most thermodynamically favored.

More specifically, propylene is used in the large-scale manufacture of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. Much of the worlds propylene is produced via cracking of hydrocarbons, specifically by fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of gas oils in refineries and steam cracking of small alkanes (1) in which propylene is a coproduct. The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand; hence, producers are always interested in developing on-demand technologies that produce propylene specifically.
Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications. The limitations include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process, which necessitates a high energy input, and coke formation resulting in catalytic deactivation. (2) One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone. (2, 3) Oxygen is a commonly used oxidant because of its low cost, low environmental impact, and the formation of H2O, which is highly exothermic, providing sufficient energy to compensate for the energy cost of dehydrogenation of alkane.
Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway. (4) To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process. (5) Supported vanadium-based oxides and mixed-metal oxides are among the most extensively studied because of their high thermal stability, large surface areas, and the favored reducibility and basicity that promote the ODH activity and selectivity. (6-10) Nevertheless, to date, none of these systems has shown product yields comparable to those obtained by the current industrial technologies of olefin production.
Another approach of reducing the overoxdiation of alkane and olefins in the ODH reactions is the use of an additive or a milder oxidant. Species such as halogens, (11) sulfur-containing compounds, (12-14) N2O, (15) and CO2 (16) have been tested respectively. CO2 with ceria-based catalyst increased the ethylene selectivity in the ethane ODH reaction to about 60% but a much higher reaction temperature was required because of the low activity of CO2. (16) On the other hand, a N2O/O2 oxidant mixture could enhance the propylene selectivity by 25% for the vanadia-catalyzed propane ODH reactions, but this increased selectivity could be obtained only at low propane conversion (110%). (15) Some studies have also been performed on the effect of H2S or other sulfur species on the ODH reactions of light alkanes. (13, 14) Initial works by Tischler and Wing (17) and Porchey and Royer (18) have demonstrated the merits of adding H2S to an uncatalyzed system for the dehydrogenation of propane. The promoting properties of H2S were further explored by Clark et al., (19) and they observed that the conversion and propylene selectivity of the propane ODH reaction over V2O5/Al2O3 were enhanced to 53.7 and 56.5%, respectively. Subsequent investigation employing elemental sulfur as the oxidant revealed that the ethylene selectivity of up to 89% with 84% overall conversion could be achieved in the gas-phase ODH reaction of ethane at 1123 K. (20) It was postulated in these studies that the enhanced olefin selectivity is attributed to the S2 intermediate, formed from reacting H2S with O2, that participates in the hydrogen abstraction of alkane, producing the olefin product and H2S, which is recycled in the reaction. (19, 20) Therefore, the present work aims at acquiring a better understanding of the effect of H2S in the alkane ODH reaction. In particular, emphasis will be placed on how H2S dictates the product selectivity, that is, the ratio of olefin to other products, in the gas-phase propane ODH reaction. The following discussion can be divided into two sections. The first part will describe the details of the ODH experiments involving C3H8/O2 and C3H8/O2/H2S feed mixtures, respectively, performed in this work. Data analysis of conversion and product selectivity by means of gas chromatography will be presented. The influence of feed gas composition, reaction temperatures, and contact time on the experimental outcomes will also be discussed. In the second part of the discussion, the data obtained from the high-level ab initio calculations for the elementary steps in the propyl + O2/S2 reactions based on the mechanisms as described by Klippenstein et al. (21) will be summarized. With an aid of these results, the experimental product distributions for the C3H8/O2 and C3H8/O2/H2S reactions will be analyzed in detail. 2 Methods
2.1 Experimental Details
2.1.1 Safety Notes
As this work requires the use of H2S, the entire experimental setup including H2S gas cylinders was contained in ventilated cabinets equipped with electronic gas detectors and automatic shut down systems designed to operate at low level alert and shut down mode (210 ppmv H2S), respectively. A hazards opeartions review of the experimental procedures was also conducted before experiments. Further details of safety operations will be described in the following sections.
2.1.2 Overall Setup and Operation Conditions
A tubular quartz tube reactor with plug flow characteristics, housed in a heated furnace, was used to carry out the experiments. Gases (nitrogen (ultra high purity), O2, H2S and propane) were purchased from Praxair and metered to the reactor using mass flow controllers and stainless steel tubing (Figure 1). Check valves and pressure relief systems were placed at various points along with a pressure gauge to monitor any back-pressure caused by solid sulfur accumulation downstream of the reactor. A relief valve, set to 10 psi, was attached to the gauge to allow venting of gases to an aqueous KOH scrubber system.
Figure 1 Figure 1. Experimental setup employed in this work and the reactor dimensions (shown in inlet).
The tube reactor was made of quartz, which was shown to have a minimal catalytic effect on the reactions under study. It was designed with a wider front and back end and a narrower middle portion. The outer diameter (OD) and length of the front end was 12.7 mm and 27.5 cm, respectively. The back end of the reactor had the same OD but had a length of 20 cm. The OD and length of the middle portion was 8.1 mm and 22.5 cm, respectively. The front end of the reactor was designed to be longer to allow the catalyst bed to be positioned a few centimeters into the hot zone of the furnace thus avoiding the temperature gradient that can exist at the boundaries of the hot zone in such furnaces. The reactor design was chosen to allow shorter contact times (10200 ms range) for the flow rates available from the mass flow controllers.
The catalyst bed was housed at the front end of the middle portion of the reactor, within the hot zone, and secured between plugs of quartz wool. A thermocouple was inserted into the front end of the catalyst bed from the front end of the reactor to record catalyst bed temperatures. A sampling tube, inserted from the back end of the reactor, allowed samples to be drawn out from the back end of the catalyst bed. The sampling tube used had a thinner diameter, hence reducing the amount of time spent in the hot zone after the catalytic reaction. The reactor was connected to a sulfur trap operated at ambient temperature followed by a dry trap, a pair of KOH scrubbers, and carbon trap to remove moisture, sulfur gases, and trace mercaptans, respectively.
The entire reactor system was housed in a ventilated cabinet equipped with H2S, SO2, and CO detectors connected to an alarm system panel. The detectors were connected to automatic shutdown valves that were set to the gas exposure limits as set out by the Alberta Environment for an 8 h working day. The lines connecting the H2S and propane gas tanks to the mass flow controllers were also connected via an air-operated valve (AOV) which, for safety reasons, had to be activated prior to each experiment and which was shut off at the end of the experiment.
Crystalline silica (Aldrich, grade 40 silica gel) crushed to 1630 mesh size was used to fill the bed for the inert filled-bed investigations. Amounts in the range 0.22 g of crystalline silica and total flow rates of 3001500 mL/min were used depending on the desired contact time. Nitrogen was used to dilute the feed gas mixture and as the internal standard to correct for condensable products. Fresh silica was loaded into the reactor before the start of each experiment. The experimental setup was then connected and sealed, followed by a leak check. The mass flow controllers were then setup to flow the feed gas at room temperature to verify feed gas concentrations, after which the reactant gases were shut off and only nitrogen was left to flow during the warm-up period of the furnace. Once all checks were complete, the furnace and heating tapes were turned on and set for the desired temperature and allowed to equilibrate for 12 h. The experiment was then started by initiating reactant gas flow and after 2030 min of equilibration time, sampling began. Once all samples at 923 K were completed, the furnace temperature was increased to 1023 K and after a sufficient equilibration period, samples were taken for analysis.
Gas samples were obtained by syringe, with a P2O5 trap placed in front of the sampling point to dehydrate and remove elemental sulfur from the samples. Analyses were carried out using gas chromatography. A Varian instrument, equipped with 2 columns (a 1.5 mm molecular sieve and an HP Q-PLOT), both of which were connected to thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) was used. A pulsed flame photometric detector (PFPD) in series with the TCD for the second column was employed for detection of sulfur compounds at ppmv levels. An SRI GC equipped with a molecular sieve column for hydrogen analysis and a T-PLOT column for hydrocarbons determination was also used. The gas samples were first analyzed as taken, and then diluted with argon (5× dilution) to obtain better resolution of the propane/propylene peaks. For each set of conditions, the outlet gas was sampled three times, each sample being taken after a 30 min time interval. The results of the three samples were then averaged to obtain the final numbers reported in this work.
2.1.3 Error Estimation and Data Processing
To test for analytical accuracy, samples were analyzed multiple times using the same experimental and analysis system that was subsequently used for the reaction studies. The experimental system was setup to flow a mixture of gases of known composition through an empty reactor. The system was kept at room temperature to prevent any reaction that changes the gas compositions. The setup was left flowing throughout the sample collection and analysis period to prevent any external factors from affecting the results. Samples were drawn from the sample port using a syringe and injected into the GC, similar to the way it was done in experiments. Three samples, 30 min apart, were taken for different gas mixtures. The average and standard deviation of the GC data were calculated and the standard deviation was further converted to relative standard deviation in percentage.
The observed experimental errors were indeed a sum of several errors, including the errors due to user sampling, GC instrument errors as well as fluctuations within the mass flow controllers over the specific time period. Experimental errors ranging from 0.13% for components in the highest amounts (60 vol %) to 3.6% for the components in the lowest amounts (5 vol %) were obtained. Accordingly, it is prudent to include an experimental error of up to 5% of the amount of reactant for this system in data analysis.
The residence time of a gas mixture tr (s) was deduced by the following expression:where Vreactor is the volume of an empty reactor, T the reaction temperature, and Ftotal the flow rate of all gas components. The data obtained from the GC were used to calculate the conversion, selectivity, and yield for each component according to the following formulas:in which i and j refer to reactants and products respectively.
The amounts of all gaseous components were obtained from gas chromatography whereas those of liquid and solid components were calculated from the remaining mass balances. Specifically, the quantities of H2O and elemental sulfur were deduced from the mass balance of O2 and sulfur components as they could not be measured directly. In the analysis of sulfur species, only H2S and elemental sulfur were expected to be present in the product mixture because the reducing equivalent (C3H8) in the feed shifts the final H2S:SO2 ratio to very high values (i.e., amount of SO2 below the detection limit) by converting SO2 back to H2S: Finally, residual solid carbon, which contains carbonaceous materials and any other carbon-containing products not identified by GC, was calculated from the mass balance of carbon-containing components.
2.2 Electronic Structure Calculations
It has been shown that the combination of hybrid functionals with a triple-ζ type basis set is sufficient to yield very good geometry, reasonable harmonic frequencies, and reaction energies of MP2 quality. (22) Therefore, geometry optimizations reported in this work were performed using the B3LYP functional (23, 24) and the Poples triple split valence 6-311G basis set augmented with one additional polarization function on each of the atoms. (25) Moreover, diffuse functions were also included, resulting in the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set in Pople notation, to better describe the transition states involving hydrogen transfer. In all structure calculations, the Berny optimization algorithm was employed; (26) tight convergence criteria on force optimization and the ultrafine integration grids were always imposed to minimize the errors associated with the numerical integrations of the DFT functional. Frequency calculations were conducted on all optimized geometries to confirm their identities on the potential energy surface. Stable intermediates possess only positive frequencies whereas transition-state species possess one imaginary frequency. Scaling factors of 0.9688 and 0.9887 for harmonic frequencies and zero-point energies, respectively, were used in the subsequent computations of thermodynamic quantities. (27) Intrinsic reaction coordinate analysis was carried out on a number of transition states to verify that they connect the desired intermediate species on the potential energy surface.
The accuracy of rate constant calculations is heavily dependent upon the quality of the potential energy surface (PES) derived from either spectroscopic measurements or electronic structure calculations. Therefore, two approaches were undertaken to improve the reaction energies as well as the activation barriers dictated by the computed PES. The first one involves the single-point energy evaluations at the CCSD(T)/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory (28-30) on the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) optimized geometries; this strategy has been shown to produce both accurate saddle point geometries and barrier heights for gas-phase reactions involving hydrogen transfer. (31) The second approach is the utilization of a highly accurate composite complete basis set (CBS) model in geometry computations. Developed by Petersson and co-workers, CBS methods target at yielding reaction enthalpies with chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol) by a series of specially designed geometry optimizations and energy evaluations. (22) In this work, the CBS-QB3 model, (32) which is a variant of the CBS-Q model (33) where the MP2 geometry optimization is replaced by B3LYP geometry optimization and the high-level correlation energy calculation is carried out at the CCSD(T) level, was employed. This method is well suited for the studies of transition states for chemical reactions, (32) and its applicability has been verified in numerous thermochemical and reaction kinetic investigations. (34-38) All electronic structure calculations were performed with the Gaussian09 suite of programs. (39) 3 Results and discussion

Other significant carbon products include CH4, C2H4, and C3H6, whereas CO and CO2 only constitute a minor portion of the product mixture, with selectivity less than 2.5%. The presence of C3H6 in non-negligible amount is an indication that the formation of C3H6 is apparently kinetically controlled; simulations of product compositions at equilibrium conditions predict no olefin products with solid carbon and CO as equilibrium products. These observations are in line qualitatively with the results reported by Huynh et al. (38) in which a positive temperature dependence of the A-factor for the propane formation from propyl + O2 was noticed.Several trends in product distributions due to temperature variation at a constant residence time could be extracted from Table 1. In general, the amounts of all species increased at higher temperature, which is attributed to an enhanced degree of reaction. In the meantime, the selectivity to solid carbon dropped significantly while it was increased for all other species. The reduced quantity of residual solid carbon at higher temperature is related to formation of CH4 and C2H4, which are all kinetically controlled, resulting from a greater degree of cracking of C3H8. Because more intermediates due to cracking (e.g., CH3 and C2H5 radicals) are present, collisions between these species that yield C2H6 are expected to occur more frequently. Moreover, because of the limited residence time in the reactor, further reaction of these species with O2 is restricted. These factors, altogether, contribute to reduced selectivity to solid carbon and the more favored formation of cracking products.The observed selectivity to C3H6 illustrated an interesting trend depending upon both reaction temperature and the feed ratio according to Tables 1 and 2. When a feed gas with C3H8:O2 = 2:1 ratio was employed, the C3H6 selectivity decreased with increasing temperature, whereas an opposite trend was found when a richer feed (i.e., 4:1) was used instead. Dehydrogenation and cracking are both endothermic processes, so it is expected that as temperature increases, both reactions would occur more readily. Dehydrogenation increases the amount of C3H6 produced, whereas cracking decreases the amount of C3H6 remaining in the product mixture. Therefore, the observed C3H6 selectivity under these conditions suggested that the dehydrogenation reaction is more dominant when oxygen is more deficient (e.g., in C3H8:O2 = 4:1 feed gas). When a more lean feed gas (i.e., 2:1 feed ratio) was supplied, the complete oxidation was enhanced, yielding more total oxidation products such as CO and CO2. This also explains the slightly reduced selectivity to C3H6 at higher temperature. The loss of C3H6 can also be attributed to the differential CH bond strength as the bond dissociation energy of CH bond in C3H6 (85 kcal/mol) (40) is lower than that in C3H8 (97 kcal/mol). (41) Steam re-forming reaction that converts C3H6 to CO2 at high temperature, especially with a long residence time, is therefore anticipated. Such an antagonistic trend of decreasing selectivity with increasing conversion has also been reported previously for other ODH catalytic systems. (6)
3.1.2 Effects of H2S Addition to the Feed Gas: Conversion and Selectivity
When H2S was added to the feed, the experimental product distributions were changed significantly. The measured product distributions for the reactions of C3H8, O2, and H2S using different feed ratios are included in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. In general, similar trends for the C3H8 + O2 reactions were observed when H2S was present in the feed gas. For instance, amounts of cracking products increased while selectivity to solid carbon dropped with increasing temperature and O2 ratio in the feed. Nevertheless, some differences between these systems in conversion and selectivity arising from H2S addition could still be noticed.
Conversion of propane is higher for the reaction containing H2S at all reaction temperatures. At the lowest reaction temperature (923 K), the conversion of propane was doubled from 19% to 38% by addition of H2S. At higher temperature (1023 K), the conversion of propane increased, though to a lesser extent, and went from 50% to 62% in the presence of H2S. With a feed containing a greater ratio of O2, the conversion of propane was increased for both reactions, but to a greater magnitude for the reaction between C3H8 and O2. The propane conversion of 50% was achieved at 923 K, which was further raised to 68% at the temperature exceeding 1023 K for the reactions involving H2S. The promoting effect of H2S on the propane conversion was eventually offset when the reaction was carried out at 1023 K with a high amount of O2; under these conditions, the conversion of C3H8 was 72% without H2S yet 68% with H2S. This trend is likely due to the enhanced partial oxidation of H2S, as inferred by a higher conversion of H2S at 1023 K, that competes with the dehydrogenation of C3H8.
Another noticeable change is concerned with the conversion of O2, where a higher value was obtained for the H2S-containing reaction. At 923 K, the conversion of O2 for the non-H2S containing reaction was 23% whereas that for the H2S containing reaction was 80% (Table 1); these values were increased to 30% and 91%, respectively (Table 2), when a more O2-rich feed was used. These observations suggest that the reaction between H2S and O2 occurs to a great extent at 923 K, hence consuming a significant amount of the O2 available at the onset of the reaction. Increasing the reaction temperature further to 973 and 1023 K led to a higher O2 conversion but the influence of H2S oxidation became less important regardless of the O2 content in the feed gas, as evidenced by the much smaller differences in O2 conversion with and without H2S at 1023 K compared to those at 923 K.
The influence of H2S on the yields and relative selectivity of C3H6 and other cracking products can be deduced from Tables 1 and 2. Addition of H2S was found to be beneficial to the production of C3H6 as reflected by the remarkable increase in yield and selectivity, and this promoting effect was more significant when a 2:1 C3H8:O2 feed was employed, where a doubled yield with 50+% selectivity could be reached at 923 K. Meanwhile, both yield and selectivity of CH4 and C2H4 increased with increasing temperature for the reaction utilizing H2S-free feed, but the inclusion of H2S in the reaction mixture reduced the yields of these species yet maintained similar selectivities at high temperatures. For example, in the reaction with 4:1 C3H8:O2 feed gas, the yield of C2H4 was increased by 83% when H2S was added at 923 K, but the same reactions at 1023 K led to a 16% reduction in the yield instead (Table 1). This adverse effect was apparently enhanced by O2. The drop of C2H4 selectivity changed from 16% to 38% when the amount of O2 in the feed gas was doubled in the reaction carried out at 1023 K. On the other hand, the formation of CH4, which was originally favored by H2S at all temperatures using a 4:1 C3H8:O2 feed, was hindered at 1023 K, giving rise to an approximately 19% decrease in yield when a 2:1 feed was used.
These observations imply that H2S favors dehydrogenation over cracking of C3H8 in the reaction. It is conceived by comparing the data in Tables 1 and 2 that O2 favors the cracking process over the dehydrogenation reaction, and a high reaction temperature is preferred. Conversely, S2 produced from the partial oxidation of H2S has been shown more active in C3H8 dehydrogenation than in the cracking. (20) Because H2S reacts readily with O2 even at 923 K, as depicted by the dramatic boost of O2 conversion, the actual amount of O2 accessible to the cracking of C3H8 is in fact diminished in the presence of H2S. Hence, the in situ formation of S2 at 923 K results in the promoted overall production of C3H8, C2H4, and CH4 in which the influence to C3H8 is more substantial. Due to the exothermic nature of the partial oxidation of H2S, the formation of S2 at 1023 K is slightly less favorable than at 923 K. On the other hand, cracking of C3H8 by O2 is significantly enhanced at 1023 K. As a consequence, the positive effect of H2S on selectivity to C3H6 is marginally offset, leading to an approximately equal yield of C3H6 and C2H4 and a slightly reduced preference to C3H6 over C2H4 as illustrated in Table 1. Increasing the O2 content in the feed promotes both cracking of C3H8 and partial oxidation of H2S, but the effect on the latter is seemingly more significant at 923 K as hinted by the much larger C3H6 selectivity compared to that to C2H4 (Table 2). Higher reaction temperature still exerts a retarding effect on S2 production and the subsequent dehydrogenation but is compensated by the faster rate of partial oxidation due to a larger initial O2 concentration in the feed, thereby resulting in higher yield and selectivity of C3H6 compared to those for C2H4 in the reaction at 1023 K with 2:1 C3H8:O2 feed.
Such detrimental effects brought by H2S were also noticed on the formation of CO and CO2. Under more O2 deficient conditions (i.e., 4:1 C3H8:O2 feed), the presence of H2S essentially eliminated CO2 completely from the product mixture except at the reaction temperature above 1023 K where a small amount of CO2 was detected (Table 1). When a more O2-rich feed was used, more CO2 was formed due to the enhanced cracking of C3H8, but the yield remained very low and its selectivity never exceeded 0.4% (Table 2). The influences of H2S on CO, on the other hand, were more intriguing. At 923 K, both yield and selectivity of CO were increased regardless of O2 content in the feed, inferring a certain extent of activating property of H2S (or S-containing intermediate) toward the cracking of C3H8. When the temperature was increased to 973 K or above, the CO selectivity started to decline. The loss of selectivity to CO could be partially compensated by using the more O2-rich feed, however, at the expense of a more severe suppression of the yield.
Residual solid carbon was always the primary product in the reactions without H2S, possibly resulting from the catalytic wall effects involving surface radicals. (42) Its selectivity reduced but yield increased at elevated temperatures or higher O2 concentration in the feed. Similar observations have been reported previously by Tran and Senkan for the studies of oxidative pyrolysis of C1 hydrocarbons; they attributed the suppressing effect of O2 to the rapid alkyl radical capture by O2 and the destruction of thus formed oxygenate intermediates to CO on reactor surface. (43) When H2S was present, both the yield and selectivity to solid carbon dropped drastically, especially for the reactions using O2-rich feed. It is, in fact, not unanticipated as H2S and other S-containing compounds are known to inhibit coke formation via the passivation of reactor surface and the alteration of homogeneous gas-phase free radical reactions. (44-47) It was postulated that H2S and SH, and presumably S2, could act in alkane pyrolysis as both initiators, by generating the initial alkyl radical by H abstraction of alkane, and terminators, by converting intermediate radicals to products via H donation. (47)
3.1.3 Effects of Inert Catalytic Bed Filler
Finally, the effects of an inert bed on the propane ODH reactions have been investigated by performing the reactions with a reactor filled with crystalline silica or quartz chips. These materials are not Claus active and are made of the same components as those to the reactor itself; therefore, no additional boost of catalytic activity due to the fillers is expected. On the other hand, it has been reported that quartz chip is a powerful radical scavenger and can substantially control the extent of gas-phase free radical reactions. (50) It should also be noted that the flow characteristics of a gas through a packed bed reactor are different from those of the gas flowing through an empty reactor. Fluid dynamics simulations have revealed the uneven and oscillatory radial and angular velocity distributions of a gas flowing through a packed tube. (48) Furthermore, factors such as core-annulus diffusion or differential longitudinal path length would also contribute to the variable flow rate of a gas inside the reactor. (49) Thus, it was of interest to compare the ODH reaction in the presence of H2S for an empty reactor versus that for a reactor filled with quartz chips mimicking the approximate flow conditions in a catalyst bed.
Results from the reactions undertaken under these conditions are summarized in Table 3. As can be seen, the product selectivities were not significantly different between these reactions; all of the product selectivity values fell within a 3% range between the two experiments. The largest change occurred on C3H6 in which its selectivity was reduced by 3% at both temperatures when quartz chips were introduced. On the other hand, major differences were found in the values of the conversion of propane and other reactants. The presence of quartz chips enhanced the conversion of propane by 7% at 923 K and 6% at 1023 K, whereas the conversion of O2 and H2S was decreased remarkably by 611% under the same conditions. Apparently, the use of quartz fillers did not modify the selectivity and product distribution to a significant degree in the propane ODH reaction with H2S.

Some results are illustrated in Table 4. Compared with the data shown in Table 2, it can be seen that most of the effects due to H2S on the yields and selectivity of C3H6, COx, and other cracking products were retained. In particular, the reduction in yields of C2H4 and CO due to H2S was more pronounced when quartz chips were used; this could be accounted for by the radical quenching property of quartz. (50) A noticeable difference, however, was found at the conversion of C3H8 where the value was reduced by 2% at 923 K and 3% at 1023 K by the addition of H2S.Table 4.

Some influences of residence time to the product selectivity could also be extracted from the data presented in Tables 2 and 4. At 923 K, doubling the residence time (i.e., from 10 to 20 ms) increased the selectivity to solid carbon and CO2 but decreased that to other carbon species including olefins. This trend is expected because a longer residence time shifts the reaction more toward the equilibrium regime at which the thermodynamic products such as carbon or CO2 are more favored. The negative effects on C3H6 and C2H4 selectivity could be partly alleviated by elevating the temperature or adding H2S to the feed, by which the kinetic products formed from dehydrogenation and cracking were enhanced.
3.2 Theoretical Model for Propane ODH Reactions
3.2.1 Initiation of the ODH Reaction: Conversion of Propane
Under the gas-phase environment where no heterogeneous initiator is present, the reaction between C3H8 and O2 is initiated by a slow hydrogen abstraction by O2 yielding HO2 and either i-C3H7 or n-C3H7 radical. This reaction has not been characterized precisely because of its slow rate and the extreme reactivity of the resulting propyl radicals. (51) Once HO2 is formed, it participates in hydrogen abstraction from other C3H8 to produce H2O2, which subsequently decomposes to OH, a radical also very reactive in the initial generation of propyl radicals. (52-54) These reaction steps have been found to have relatively low reaction barriers, and thus are crucial to the overall kinetics of propane oxidation. In the meantime, the pyrolysis of C3H8 to CH3 and C2H5 radicals is strongly favored and dominates the initial consumption of propane at the temperatures between 900 and 1200 K and in fuel-rich conditions. (53) Kinetic modeling of the combustion of small alkanes also revealed that the hydrogen abstraction from C3H8 by H radical is also a major reaction channel accounting for the decay of C3H8. (53, 54) In short, the following are the most important reaction routes in the initial stage of propane oxidation.
Apparently, the first three reaction steps are unaffected by the presence of H2S in the feed gas as no oxidant species are directly involved. The remaining reaction steps, however, are anticipated to be sensitive to H2S. Exothermic partial oxidation of H2S occurs readily at high temperature, producing S2 that may compete with O2 in the initiation cycle of propane oxidation. This process also consumes O2 substantially and reduces its amount in the feed. The sulfur-containing radical intermediates such as SH and HS2 thus formed are also active species competing with OH and HO2 in the propagation of hydrogen abstraction reactions. Accordingly, the observed enhanced conversion of C3H8 in the reactions involving H2S must be attributable to H2S partial oxidation as well as the competitive hydrogen abstraction of C3H8 by O2, OH, HO2, and the sulfur analogs.
No direct experimental measurements of the rate constant of C3H8 + O2 reaction have yet been accomplished. The literature values of activation energy associated with this process were estimated from the experimental standard enthalpy change of reaction assuming a barrierless CH bond dissociation channel. (55, 56) As shown in Table 5, the standard reaction enthalpy of C3H8 + O2 computed using CBS-QB3 were 53.09 and 49.62 kcal/mol for primary and secondary hydrogen abstraction, respectively. These values are in agreement with the values compiled by Walker (47.5 kcal/mol) (55) and Westbrook and co-workers (52.0 kcal/mol). (56) At the same level of theory, the standard enthalpy changes for C3H8 + S2 reaction were found to be 45.40 and 41.93 kcal/mol, respectively, both of which were substantially smaller than the corresponding values for O2 systems, suggesting that the hydrogen abstraction by S2 should be kinetically more favored. The trend became more manifest at 1023 K, where the respective free energy changes for C3H8 + S2 reactions were reduced to 33.28 and 29.49 kcal/mol compared to 41.84 and 38.05 kcal/mol for the oxygen counterparts.

CBS-QB3 calculations performed in the present work also obtained a large exotherm for the partial oxidation of H2S by O2; the value of ΔHrxn = 74.20 kcal/mol agrees very well with the standard enthalpy (cf. 75.05 kcal/mol) reported by Clark et al. (20) When this reaction step was taken into account, the energy profile for the initial hydrogen abstraction of C3H8 was altered remarkably. The process became exothermic even at 298 K, largely attributed to the formation of stable H2O, with the standard enthalpy changes of 28.80 and 32.27 kcal/mol for n-C3H7 and i-C3H7.
The kinetics of the H2S + O2 reaction has been investigated computationally by Montoya et al. using the Gaussian method and variational transition-state theory. (57) They predicted that the rate-limiting step of the reaction corresponds to the formation of H2SO2 superoxide with an energy barrier of 208.4 kJ/mol. The potential energy surface has been reoptimized presently using CBS-QB3, and a similar activation energy of 212.08 kJ/mol was yielded for the same step. Nevertheless, another more energetic transition state has been located; this state, connecting the superoxide to peroxide intermediates, is about 15 kJ/mol less stable, resulting in an apparent activation energy of 227.28 kJ/mol (54.32 kcal/mol) for the H2S oxidation. It can been seen by comparing this value with those in Table 5 that the C3H8 + O2 and 2H2S + O2 reactions are kinetically competitive, with the former one being marginally more favored.
According to these data, it could be postulated that O2 participates in the hydrogen abstraction of C3H8 and the partial oxidation of H2S at approximately the same rate when the feed gas is first directed into the reaction chamber at temperature around 1000 K. Due to the large exothermicity of the latter process, the reaction system would be gradually driven toward the formation of S2, thereby increasing the consumption of O2 in the feed. Meanwhile, because S2 is a more reactive hydrogen abstraction agent than O2, the conversion of C3H8 would also be promoted due to the in situ formation of S2.
It has been demonstrated by the kinetic modeling of alkane oxidation conducted by Dagaut et al., (53) Leung et al., (54) and Koert et al. (58) that the dominant O-containing reaction paths in C3H8 consumption after the initiation period consist mainly of the abstraction of hydrogen from C3H8 by OH radicals whereas HO2 radicals may play a slightly less significant role. Trends consistent with these observations could be deduced from the data presented in Table 6. The abstractions of hydrogen by OH and SH were found to be both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable than the corresponding reactions by HO2 and HS2, respectively, although the reactions involving SH and HS2 were endothermic, nonspontaneous, and more kinetically hindered even at 1023 K. The only exception was the formation of i-C3H7 from C3H8 + SH where the free energy change at CBS-QB3 level was 1.86 kcal/mol. Interestingly, no transition state could be located for the reactions with HS2; well-defined transition states only appeared when entropy was taken into consideration on the free energy surface.

The endothermic nature of the reactions involving SH and HS2 was completely offset by the extremely exothermic partial oxidation of H2S by O2, whose free energy change was 71.66 kcal/mol at 1023 K. The modified free energy diagrams are depicted in Figure 2. As can be seen, the large free energy output from the formation of S2 stabilized considerably the reaction routes to n-C3H8 and i-C3H7 relative to the corresponding channels including only O2 and made these transformations much more accessible under the reaction conditions desipte an overall uphill trend in terms of energy. It is therefore expected that the presence of sulfur species in the feed mixture also exerts a promoting effect on the conversion of C3H8 after the initial stage of oxidation.

3.2.2 Product Distribution Analysis for Propyl + O2
Comprehensive potential energy diagrams for the addition reaction of C3H7 radicals and O2, as well as the decomposition of C3H7OO have been computed previously by several groups to acquire insights into the kinetics of low-temperature combustion of alkanes. (21, 35, 38, 59, 60) It was proposed in their work that seven carbon-containing end products could be formed from the n-C3H7OO radical and three from the i-C3H7OO radical. Their appearance in the final product mixture, however, is subjected to the reaction temperatures and the free energy barriers associated with the formation of each product.
Potential energy surfaces (E + ZPE at 0 K) for the n-C3H7 + O2 and i-C3H7 + O2 computed at the CBS-QB3 level of theory are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The present results were essentially identical to the data obtained by Merle et al. (35) and Huynh et al. (38) using the same approach. In most cases the energy deviation was smaller than 0.2 kcal/mol. The only noticeable differences appeared at the transition state connecting CH2CH2CH2OO and cyclopropane, and at the transition state corresponding to the isomerization of CH3CH(OO)CH3 to CH3CH(OOH)CH2; in both cases, the present work predicted a barrier about 1 kcal/mol smaller than that reported previously.
Figure 3 Figure 3. CBS-QB3 potential energy surface (at 0 K) for the n-C3H7 + O2 reaction.
Figure 4 Figure 4. CBS-QB3 potential energy surface (at 0 K) for the i-C3H7 + O2 reaction. Energies are reported with respect to n-C3H7 (Figure 3).
It was deduced on the basis of the CBS-QB3 energy diagrams that the oxygenated hydrocarbons (i.e., propanal, methyloxirane, and oxetane) were the most thermodynamically stable products, followed by ethylene and propene. Cyclopropane was the least stable product because of a relatively huge ring strain. In the low temperature regime where chemical activation dominates the progress of propane oxidation, the formation of propanal, cyclopropane, formaldehyde, and ethylene was suppressed due to their high activation barriers. Propene was the kinetic product and methyloxirane was the thermodynamic product; therefore, for a low-temperature reaction with a short contact time, a relatively large selectivity toward propene was expected. On the other hand, at high temperature regime, thermal activation became more important, and all these products should be present in the product mixture. Because the transition state corresponding to ethylene formation was only 8 kcal/mol higher than the reactants (i.e., n-C3H7 + O2), it could be easily overcome by thermal activation. Consequently, ethylene was anticipated to be the major olefin product at higher temperature. The selectivity favoring ethylene was also promoted by entropy at higher temperature because of the larger increase in molecularity of this channel compared to that to propylene.
The scenario for the i-C3H7 + O2 reaction is more simple because fewer types of products could be formed. Isomerization of the isopropylperoxy radical led to propanone, which was the most thermodynamically stable product as in the case of the n-C3H7 + O2 reaction, methyloxirane and propylene. As can be seen in Figure 4, the conversion channels to methyloxirane and propylene were lower in energy than the entrance (i.e., i-C3H7 + O2), implying that their formation occurred readily even at the lower temperature range in which only chemical activation was possible. The conversion to propanone, on the other hand, had the transition state about 3 kcal/mol higher than the entrance, and therefore, thermal agitation was required to activate this channel. The transition state associated with the propylene formation from i-C3H7 was in fact lower in energy than that associated with the propylene formation from n-C3H7 (8.64 kcal/mol versus 4.27 kcal/mol). Recall that i-C3H7 was the more dominant product than n-C3H7 in the O2 mediated H abstraction of propane. As a result, i-C3H7 should be responsible for the formation of most propylene in the final product mixture.
This trend could also be seen from the Gibbs free energy diagrams shown in Figures 5 and 6, in which ethylene was the most thermodynamically stable product at 1023 K. In the meantime, propylene, whose formation is still more kinetically favored, yet to a lesser extent, was a much less stable product than ethylene. Accordingly, ethylene selectivity in the C3H8 + O2 reaction was expected to increase with temperature. This agreed very well with the data presented in Tables 1 and 2 where the selectivity toward ethylene increased from 17% to 27% using 4:1 C3H8/O2 feed gas, and from 20% to 29% using 2:1 C3H8/O2 feed gas when the temperature was raised from 923 to 1023 K. Despite an apparent qualitative consistency between the predicted temperature dependence of product distribution and the experimental data, one has to be reminded that there are more reaction channels other than the direct elimination reaction of CH2CH2CH2OOH that would produce ethylene (for example, thermal cracking or oxidation of C3 intermediates). The observed increase in ethylene selectivity should therefore be interpreted as the combined consequences of both the shift of the reaction toward an equilibrium regime that favors ethylene formation, and the promoted subsequent decompositions of C3 intermediates at high temperatures, the parts not included in the present theoretical model.

3.2.3 Product Distribution Analysis for Propyl + S2
Substantial differences in details of reaction channels and product distributions were observed when S2, formed in situ from partial oxidation of H2S, is present in the system. Figures 7 and 8 depict the potential energy diagrams corresponding to the association reactions of n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals with S2, and the unimolecular decomposition of the resulting C3H7SS intermediates. Comparing Figures 3 and 7, it can be seen that the trend of relative stability of the decomposition products was reversed. Unlike the O2 system in which oxygenated species were more preferred, S-containing hydrocarbon products, i.e., methylthiirane, thietane, propanethial, and thioformaldehyde, were unstable with respect to propylene and cyclopropane. Propylene was the more favored olefin product, and the most stable among all products from a thermodynamic viewpoint. The instability of S-containing species may result from the weaker CS bond compared to CO bond, and the steric bulk due to larger atomic size of S that created a bigger torsional strain in the cyclic compounds such as thietane and methylthiirane. For instance, oxetane had a C2v ground-state structure where CO and CC bonds were 1.448 and 1.542 Å, respectively, as determined at CBS-QB3 level of theory. On the other hand, thietane, the sulfur analog of oxetane, possessed a lower-symmetry (i.e., Cs) ground-state structure and the two CS bonds were much elongated (1.859 Å cf. 1.448 Å). The distortion in the structure of thietane resulted in its much lower thermodynamic stability than oxetane relative to n-C3H7.

Figure 8 Figure 8. CBS-QB3 potential energy surface (at 0 K) for the i-C3H7 + S2 reaction. Energies are reported with respect to n-C3H7 (Figure 7).
From the kinetics perspective, the decomposition of n-C3H7SS occurred readily because most of the reaction channels were below the entrance level (i.e., n-C3H7 + S2), and therefore the n-C3H7SS intermediate was sufficiently energetic, due to chemical activation, to proceed to the products. There were two exceptions, however. Starting from the CH2CH2CH2SSH radical, the conversion to cyclopropane + SSH and the transformation to ethylene + CH2SSH had the barriers 7 kcal/mol above the entrance level, suggesting their formation is kinetically hindered at low temperature. According to Figure 7, the conversion to propylene is the most kinetically feasible channel and should be more favored in the S2 system than in the O2 system because of a lower forward reaction barrier. Interestingly, the direct elimination route of propylene from n-propylperoxy radical was absent in the S2 system, and all propylene was produced in a sequential transformation involving the CH3CHCH2SSH intermediate. The actual reason for this observation was unknown, but this seemed to enhance the formation of propylene because the direct elimination was expected to be accompanied by a reaction barrier higher than those in the alternative route, as inferred by Figure 3.
The reaction scheme for i-C3H7 + S2, as the O2 counterpart, was straightforward, as only three products were anticipated: thioacetone, methylthiirane, and propylene. Because all these channels were located below the i-C3H7 + S2 entrance level, these interconversions should occur rapidly even without thermal activation, and all products including thioacetone were expected to be present in the product mixture. As in the n-C3H7 + S2 reaction, propylene was among the most thermodynamically favorable product. At low reaction temperature where kinetic control was more important, propylene was the major product because the associated reaction barrier was lower than that for the formation of thioacetone. Its formation was also more favored than methylthiirane although they shared the same intermediate precursor.
Increasing the reaction temperature may affect the final product distribution for the C3H7 + S2 reaction as the reaction routes being kinetically limited would become more accessible by means of thermal activation. Figures 9 and 10 describe the Gibbs free energy diagrams for the n-C3H7 + S2 and i-C3H7 + S2 reaction at 1023 K. When the entropic effect was taken into account, the relative stability of various products was slightly altered. Although propylene remained the most energetically favored product, ethylene and propanethial were stabilized and became more stable than cyclopropane and methylthiirane, respectively. The formation of ethylene was still restricted largely by the high barrier (41 kcal/mol above the entrance level on the free energy surface) connecting the CH2CH2CH2SSH intermediate and ethylene. On the other hand, the reaction route leading to propylene was the most kinetically accessible among all possible decomposition pathways, yet the difference in forward reaction barrier between the formation of propylene and ethylene was reduced from 30 kcal/mol at 0 K to 11 kcal/mol at 1023 K.

An intriguing observation was noticed in the free energy diagram for the n-C3H7 + S2 system. The initial formation of the n-C3H7S2 adduct at 1023 K was exergonic by 10.20 kcal/mol and was thus spontaneous. The existence of such a stable intermediate on the free energy surface limited the possibilities of the formation of various products. Form Figure 9, it was found that all of the products except propylene and ethylene were higher in free energy than n-C3H7SS. This suggested that the formation of propylene and ethylene was selective over other species whose formation required additional energy input. A similar, complex situation was also seen in the reaction channels for i-C3H7 in Figure 10. Unlike isopropylperoxy radical, the formation of i-C3H7SS was spontaneous at 1023 K. However, only the subsequent conversion to propylene was spontaneous whereas the transformations to thioacetone and methylthiirane were endergonic, inferring that propylene would predominate the product mixture in the i-C3H7 + S2 reaction at such temperature.
These results implied that propylene would be a more selective olefin product than ethylene at all temperatures, but the difference in selectivity would decrease when the reaction temperature was increased. It can be seen from Table 1 that the difference in product selectivity of propylene and ethylene reduced from 14% at 923 K to 12% at 1023 K when a fuel-rich feed was used. Doubling the amount of O2 in the feed enlarged the difference in selectivity, which was not unanticipated as the ODH reactions as a whole were promoted. Meanwhile, the negative temperature dependence on the difference in selectivity of these olefin products was still observed; the difference dropped from 29% at 923 K to 24% at 1023 K according to Table 2. Again, the comparison between the predictions based on the CBS-QB3 derived model and the observed trends of selectivity should be made with caution because secondary decompositions of C3 products that would lead to ethylene were not explicitly considered in the model. 4 Conclusions It has been demonstrated in this work that the reaction of C3H8 and O2 at around 1000 K in the absence of metal oxide catalysts was able to produce ethylene and propylene with decent selectivity. At 923 K, the observed selectivities of propylene and ethylene were 13 and 17%, respectively, which were increased to 21 and 27% at 1023 K when a 4:1 C3H8:O2 was employed. In the meantime, the overall conversion of propane was boosted from 19% to 50%. Doubling the O2 content in the feed further increased the propane conversion up to 72% at 1023 K at the expense of lower olefin selectivity, possibly because of the overoxidation of the olefin products. When H2S was added to the feed, remarkable enhancement on propane conversion and product selectivity favoring olefins was observed. In particular, though O2 favored the formation of ethylene over propylene, the presence of H2S reversed the trend, and propylene was formed predominantly. With the feed composed of 4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S, the maximum propylene selectivity achieved was 51% with the propane conversion of 50% at 923 K. Increasing the temperature to 1023 K slightly reduced the propylene selectivity to 49% but the propane conversion was enhanced to 68%.
To fully understand the reasons for the promoted propane conversion and the selectivity favoring propylene over ethylene, a theoretical model was developed on the basis of the CBS-QB3 methodology. The computed potential energy diagrams agreed very well with the experimental observations and enabled an accurate prediction of product distributions in the final product mixtures for both C3H8 + O2 and C3H8 + O2 + H2S reactions. It was revealed according to the CBS-QB3 calculations that S2 was indeed the oxidant responsible for the propane oxidation when H2S was present in the feed, and it was formed from the rapid partial oxidation of H2S by O2 at around 1000 K. In addition, the enhanced selectivity toward propylene in the C3H8 + O2 + H2S reaction resulted from the formation of relatively unstable sulfur-containing hydrocarbon species such as propanethial, methylthiirane, and thioformaldehyde.
The data presented in this work showed clearly that the current reaction design (i.e., gas-phase C3H8/O2/H2S) without including any solid oxide ODH catalyst would already be able to afford the propane conversion and propylene selectivity comparative to those when vanadia or alumina was employed, although a higher operation temperature (greater by 150200 K approximately) was required. It therefore could serve as an attractive alternative to industrial ODH reaction plants as much less effort was required in terms of reactor designs and operation costs.
