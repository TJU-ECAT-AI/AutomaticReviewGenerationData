The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, low selectivity, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more environmentally friendly process with reduced CO2 emissions. However, the use of CO2 as an oxidant introduces challenges related to CO formation, which can inhibit propylene production. The addition of secondary surface metal oxides as additives can improve the performance of the ODHP process, enhancing both propylene yield and selectivity. The optimization of these additives, however, remains a challenge due to their dependence on factors such as concentration, type, and interaction with the catalyst support.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、低选择性和环境问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一个具有较低二氧化碳排放量的更环保过程，解决了这些问题。然而，使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂引入了与二氧化碳形成相关的问题，这会抑制丙烯的产生。添加次级表面金属氧化物作为添加剂可以改善ODHP过程的性能，提高丙烯的产率和选择性。然而，这些添加剂的优化仍然是一个挑战，因为它们的有效性依赖于诸如浓度、类型和与催化剂支撑物的相互作用等各个因素。
