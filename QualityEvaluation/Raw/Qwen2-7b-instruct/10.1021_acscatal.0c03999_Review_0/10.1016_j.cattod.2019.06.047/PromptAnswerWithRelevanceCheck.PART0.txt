The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and capital costs. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency and potentially lower capital costs through the use of oxygen as an oxidant. However, ODHP faces challenges such as the formation of CO and CO2, which can inhibit the reaction and affect product selectivity. To mitigate these issues, researchers have explored the use of additives like carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide to enhance the performance of vanadia-based catalysts supported on alumina, which have been found to offer high activity and stability in ODHP reactions.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and significant environmental impact due to reliance on fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process for propylene production. In ODHP, propane is converted to propylene using molecular oxygen as the oxidant. To enhance the performance of catalysts in ODHP, researchers often incorporate carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives. However, selecting the oxidant in ODHP is crucial, as it impacts reaction kinetics and product distribution. When oxygen is used as the oxidant, it can lead to rapid deactivation of catalysts due to processes such as sintering and poisoning.
