1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is high energy consumption and environmental impact. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient alternative. Oxygen, used as an oxidant in ODHP, poses challenges due to its reactivity, which can lead to unwanted side reactions. Adding secondary surface metal oxide additives improves catalyst selectivity and activity, mitigating the challenges associated with oxygen. However, the selection of metal oxide and its effect on the catalyst's performance need careful optimization to ensure both efficiency and selectivity.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是高能耗和随之而来的环境影响。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能的选择来解决这些问题。作为ODHP中使用的氧化剂，氧气因其反应性而带来挑战，可能导致不希望发生的副反应。添加次级表面金属氧化物添加剂可以提高催化剂的选择性和活性，从而缓解氧气带来的挑战。然而，选择金属氧化物及其对催化剂性能的影响需要仔细优化，以确保效率和选择性。

2. 丙烯生产当前面临的主要挑战是高能量消耗及由此产生的环境问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）作为一种更节能的替代方案，能够降低二氧化碳排放，从而解决这些挑战。在ODHP过程中使用氧气，由于其高度反应性，会引发不利的副反应。为了应对这一挑战，可通过添加次级表面金属氧化物添加剂来改善催化剂的活性和选择性。然而，选择合适的金属氧化物及其对催化剂性能的影响需要精确的优化，以实现高效与选择性的平衡。
