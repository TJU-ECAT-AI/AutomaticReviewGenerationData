The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and capital costs. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency and potentially lower capital costs through the use of oxygen as an oxidant. However, ODHP faces challenges such as the formation of CO and CO2, which can inhibit the reaction and affect product selectivity. To mitigate these issues, researchers have explored the use of additives like carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide to enhance the performance of vanadia-based catalysts supported on alumina, which have been found to offer high activity and stability in ODHP reactions.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和高昂的资本成本。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过使用氧气作为氧化剂来解决这些问题，从而提供更高的能效和潜在更低的资本成本。然而，ODHP面临挑战，如CO和CO2的形成，这可以抑制反应并影响产物选择性。为了缓解这些问题，研究人员探索了使用二氧化碳和表面金属氧化物二次添加剂来提高以氧化铝为载体的钒基催化剂的性能。这些催化剂在ODHP反应中被发现具有高活性和稳定性。
