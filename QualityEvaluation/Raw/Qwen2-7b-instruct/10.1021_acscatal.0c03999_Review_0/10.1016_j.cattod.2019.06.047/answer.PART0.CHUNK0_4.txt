The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and significant CO2 emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. Oxygen is commonly used as the oxidant in ODHP processes. To enhance the efficiency of the ODHP, secondary surface metal oxides are added as catalyst additives. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a critical component in the ODHP process.
