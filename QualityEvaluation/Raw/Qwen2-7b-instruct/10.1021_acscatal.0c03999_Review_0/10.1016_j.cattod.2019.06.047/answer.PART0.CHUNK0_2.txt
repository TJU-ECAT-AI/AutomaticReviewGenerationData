1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and significant environmental impact due to reliance on fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process for propylene production. In ODHP, propane is converted to propylene using molecular oxygen as the oxidant. To enhance the performance of catalysts in ODHP, researchers often incorporate carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives. However, selecting the oxidant in ODHP is crucial, as it impacts reaction kinetics and product distribution. When oxygen is used as the oxidant, it can lead to rapid deactivation of catalysts due to processes such as sintering and poisoning.
