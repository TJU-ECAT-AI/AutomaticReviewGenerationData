The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and environmental concerns due to the reliance on fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by utilizing solar thermal energy, offering a more sustainable alternative. The process benefits from the use of CO2 as an oxidant, enhancing its potential compared to lighter and heavier hydrocarbon homologues. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 operates favorably within the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius, making it potentially compatible with solar thermal energy applications. The process also features the reverse water gas shift reaction, which contributes to the equilibrium shift, facilitating the conversion of propane to propylene. The use of catalysts, such as Cr2O3/ZrO2, enables efficient conversion of propane to propylene, with optimization of reaction conditions leading to improvements in propylene selectivity and stability. The mechanism involves the activation of propane on the catalyst surface, with CO2 contributing to the equilibrium shift by oxidizing hydrogen released from propane dehydrogenation. Increasing the contact time for propane molecules on the catalyst surface can lead to decreased conversion, but this is counterbalanced by the enhancement of propylene selectivity through competitive adsorption effects between the generated propylene and deactivated propane molecules. The overall approach presents a promising avenue for CO2 utilization and propylene production with a reduced carbon footprint, aligning with sustainable energy sources and waste management strategies.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和环境问题，由于依赖化石燃料。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过利用太阳能热能解决了这些问题，提供了一种更可持续的选择。该过程受益于将二氧化碳用作氧化剂，其潜力与较轻和较重的烃类同系物相比有所增强。热力学计算表明，在300-500摄氏度的温度范围内，丙烷在二氧化碳的存在下进行脱氢操作有利，这可能与太阳能热能应用兼容。该过程还涉及水煤气逆向反应，有助于平衡转移，促进丙烷转化为丙烯。催化剂，如Cr2O3/ZrO2，使丙烷高效转化为丙烯成为可能，优化反应条件可提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。机制涉及在催化剂表面激活丙烷，二氧化碳通过氧化从丙烷脱氢释放的氢气来贡献到平衡转移。增加丙烷分子在催化剂表面上的接触时间可能导致转化率降低，但通过生成丙烯和失活丙烷分子的竞争吸附效应增强丙烯选择性可以抵消这一点。总体而言，这种方法为二氧化碳利用和丙烯生产提供了有前景的途径，碳足迹较低，并与可再生能源来源和废物管理策略相一致。
