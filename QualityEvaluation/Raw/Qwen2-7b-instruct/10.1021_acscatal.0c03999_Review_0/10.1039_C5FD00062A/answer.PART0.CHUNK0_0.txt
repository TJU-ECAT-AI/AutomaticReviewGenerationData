[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "From the aspect of the ultimate application of this particular CO2 utilisation processes, we believe that the enhancement of selectivity of the (target) C3H6 product, whilst sacrificing some of the reactants ultimate conversion is acceptable."
[4] "However, one must stress again that any proposed CCU process to be realistic for emission reduction potential can only be beneficial if any necessary energy input is from renewable sources."
[5] "Our view is that solar thermal chemical processes for CO2 utilisation, accessible across these temperature ranges, offer very considerable potential in that important regard."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels, and environmental impact. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by utilizing a more sustainable energy source, solar thermal energy, which reduces dependency on fossil fuels. This method also aims to enhance the selectivity of the target product, propylene, while sacrificing some of the reactants' ultimate conversion. However, the feasibility of CO2 utilization processes relies on the energy input being from renewable sources to ensure emission reduction potential. Solar thermal chemical processes for CO2 utilization offer significant potential in this regard, making them an attractive alternative for sustainable propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、对化石燃料的依赖以及环境影响。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过利用更可持续的能源来源，即太阳能热能，解决了这些问题，从而减少了对化石燃料的依赖。这种方法还旨在提高目标产品的选择性，即丙烯，同时牺牲部分反应物的最终转化率。然而，CO2利用过程的可行性取决于输入能量来自可再生能源，以确保减排潜力。太阳能热化学过程对于CO2利用提供了重要的可能性，使其成为可持续丙烯生产有吸引力的替代方案。
