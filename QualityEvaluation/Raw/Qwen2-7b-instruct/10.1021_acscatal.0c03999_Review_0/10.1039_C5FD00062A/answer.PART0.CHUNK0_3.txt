[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[2] "The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in the modelled, complete reacting system of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will affect the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products."
[3] "An increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 can be significantly affected by various competing side reactions which are deleterious to the targeted C3H6 yield, selectivity and indeed to the stability of the operating catalyst."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods often include high energy consumption, environmental impact, and potentially hazardous byproducts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly process for propylene production. By utilizing oxygen as the oxidant, ODHP reduces the need for fossil fuels and decreases the carbon footprint. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant, in this case, oxygen, presents its own set of challenges. Oxygen, while effective, can also lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts if not carefully managed. Additionally, the specific challenges associated with using oxygen include its reactivity, which can lead to the production of unwanted compounds, and the need for precise control over the reaction conditions to maintain product selectivity and yield. Despite these challenges, ODHP offers significant advantages, including higher energy efficiency and the potential for cleaner production processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境影响和潜在的有害副产品。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种更高效且环保的丙烯生产方式，解决了这些问题。通过使用氧气作为氧化剂，ODHP减少了对化石燃料的需求，并降低了碳足迹。然而，在选择合适的氧化剂时，即使用氧气，也存在一系列挑战。氧气虽然有效，但在不适当管理的情况下，也可能导致形成不希望的副产物。此外，使用氧气的具体挑战包括其反应性，这可能导致产生不希望的化合物，以及需要精确控制反应条件以保持产品选择性和产率的需要。尽管存在这些挑战，ODHP提供了显著的优势，包括更高的能效和可能的清洁生产过程。
