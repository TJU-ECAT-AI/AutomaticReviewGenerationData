[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "The results showed that an increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[3] "From the aspect of the ultimate application of this particular CO2 utilisation processes, we believe that the enhancement of selectivity of the (target) C3H6 product, whilst sacrificing some of the reactants ultimate conversion is acceptable."
[4] "However, one must stress again that any proposed CCU process to be realistic for emission reduction potential can only be beneficial if any necessary energy input is from renewable sources."
[5] "Our view is that solar thermal chemical processes for CO2 utilisation, accessible across these temperature ranges, offer very considerable potential in that important regard."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels, and environmental impact. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by utilizing a more sustainable energy source, solar thermal energy, which reduces dependency on fossil fuels. This method also aims to enhance the selectivity of the target product, propylene, while sacrificing some of the reactants' ultimate conversion. However, the feasibility of CO2 utilization processes relies on the energy input being from renewable sources to ensure emission reduction potential. Solar thermal chemical processes for CO2 utilization offer significant potential in this regard, making them an attractive alternative for sustainable propylene production.

[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[2] "Importantly, the results highlight the enhanced potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively)."
[3] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[4] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."

[6] "Our research, then, looks in detail at the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by CO2 as a potential prospect for CO2 utilisation in temperature and reaction conditions where the ultimate application of solar thermal energy may be a promising technology."
[7] "From the macro perspective, the average contact time for each C3H8 molecule is shortened with the higher C3H8 fractional GHSV, and this is the cause of a decreased C3H8 conversion by optimising both methods to modify the C3H8 fractional GHSV."
[8] "The results revealed effective C3H8 conversions at each specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning of reactions."
[9] "The high stability of the C3H8 conversion, as shown in Figure 7."
[10] "The mechanism of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves the primary activation of C3H8 on the catalyst surface, while CO2 provides a contribution to the reaction equilibrium shift by oxidising H2 generated from the C3H8 dehydrogenation (via the reverse water gas shift reaction)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and environmental concerns due to the reliance on fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by utilizing solar thermal energy, offering a more sustainable alternative. The process benefits from the use of CO2 as an oxidant, enhancing its potential compared to lighter and heavier hydrocarbon homologues. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 operates favorably within the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius, making it potentially compatible with solar thermal energy applications. The process also features the reverse water gas shift reaction, which contributes to the equilibrium shift, facilitating the conversion of propane to propylene. The use of catalysts, such as Cr2O3/ZrO2, enables efficient conversion of propane to propylene, with optimization of reaction conditions leading to improvements in propylene selectivity and stability. The mechanism involves the activation of propane on the catalyst surface, with CO2 contributing to the equilibrium shift by oxidizing hydrogen released from propane dehydrogenation. Increasing the contact time for propane molecules on the catalyst surface can lead to decreased conversion, but this is counterbalanced by the enhancement of propylene selectivity through competitive adsorption effects between the generated propylene and deactivated propane molecules. The overall approach presents a promising avenue for CO2 utilization and propylene production with a reduced carbon footprint, aligning with sustainable energy sources and waste management strategies.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和环境问题，由于依赖化石燃料。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过利用太阳能热能解决了这些问题，提供了一种更可持续的选择。该过程受益于将二氧化碳用作氧化剂，其潜力与较轻和较重的烃类同系物相比有所增强。热力学计算表明，在300-500摄氏度的温度范围内，丙烷在二氧化碳的存在下进行脱氢操作有利，这可能与太阳能热能应用兼容。该过程还涉及水煤气逆向反应，有助于平衡转移，促进丙烷转化为丙烯。催化剂，如Cr2O3/ZrO2，使丙烷高效转化为丙烯成为可能，优化反应条件可提高丙烯选择性和稳定性。机制涉及在催化剂表面激活丙烷，二氧化碳通过氧化从丙烷脱氢释放的氢气来贡献到平衡转移。增加丙烷分子在催化剂表面上的接触时间可能导致转化率降低，但通过生成丙烯和失活丙烷分子的竞争吸附效应增强丙烯选择性可以抵消这一点。总体而言，这种方法为二氧化碳利用和丙烯生产提供了有前景的途径，碳足迹较低，并与可再生能源来源和废物管理策略相一致。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods often include high energy consumption, environmental impact, and potentially hazardous byproducts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly process for propylene production. By utilizing oxygen as the oxidant, ODHP reduces the need for fossil fuels and decreases the carbon footprint. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant, in this case, oxygen, presents its own set of challenges. Oxygen, while effective, can also lead to the formation of undesirable byproducts if not carefully managed. Additionally, the specific challenges associated with using oxygen include its reactivity, which can lead to the production of unwanted compounds, and the need for precise control over the reaction conditions to maintain product selectivity and yield. Despite these challenges, ODHP offers significant advantages, including higher energy efficiency and the potential for cleaner production processes.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels, and environmental concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially lower energy-consuming process that uses propane as a feedstock. It presents advantages such as the direct production of propylene without the need for additional processing steps. However, ODHP faces its own set of challenges, including the selection of an appropriate oxidant, typically oxygen, which can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts and requires careful control to maintain product purity and efficiency. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant involve balancing the reaction kinetics, maintaining a suitable reaction temperature, and minimizing the formation of coke, which can deactivate the catalyst. The use of solar thermal energy for such processes aims to make the utilization of CO2 more accessible and sustainable, potentially shifting the focus from CO2 disposal to its production and use as a commodity chemical.
