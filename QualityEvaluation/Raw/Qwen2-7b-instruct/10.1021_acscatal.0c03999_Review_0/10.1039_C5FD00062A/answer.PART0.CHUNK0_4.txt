[1] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[2] "Thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[3] "The results highlight the enhanced potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively)."
[4] "To be utilised in this CO2 utilisation reaction The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in the modelled, complete reacting system of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will affect the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products."
[5] "An increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[6] "However, one must stress again that any proposed CCU process to be realistic for emission reduction potential can only be beneficial if any necessary energy input is from renewable sources."
[7] "We believe that Low-to Medium Temperature Solar Thermochemical processes offer considerable opportunities in that regard and the research outlined here-setting out the complete thermodynamic analysis together with a catalytic chemistry study - may present a way forward for CO2 utilisation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels, and environmental concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially lower energy-consuming process that uses propane as a feedstock. It presents advantages such as the direct production of propylene without the need for additional processing steps. However, ODHP faces its own set of challenges, including the selection of an appropriate oxidant, typically oxygen, which can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts and requires careful control to maintain product purity and efficiency. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant involve balancing the reaction kinetics, maintaining a suitable reaction temperature, and minimizing the formation of coke, which can deactivate the catalyst. The use of solar thermal energy for such processes aims to make the utilization of CO2 more accessible and sustainable, potentially shifting the focus from CO2 disposal to its production and use as a commodity chemical.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、对化石燃料的依赖以及与温室气体排放相关的环境问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过使用丙烷作为原料来解决这些问题，提供了一个潜在的低能耗过程，可以直接生产丙烯，无需额外的处理步骤。然而，ODHP面临自己的挑战，包括选择合适的氧化剂，通常为氧气，这可能导致形成不希望的副产品，并需要仔细控制以保持产品的纯度和效率。使用氧气作为氧化剂的具体挑战包括平衡反应动力学、维持合适的反应温度以及最小化焦炭的形成，焦炭可以破坏催化剂。利用太阳能热化学方法进行此类过程旨在使CO2的利用更具可访问性和可持续性，可能将CO2的处置焦点转移到其作为商品化学品的生产和使用上。
