The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include their endothermic nature and the production of coke, which is a byproduct that can clog equipment. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and effectively reducing coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in selecting the appropriate oxidant. Oxygen can fully oxidize the catalyst, leading to total oxidation of propane. CO2, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that can prevent the formation of non-selective oxygen, thus reducing total oxidation of propane. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation leads to higher selectivity towards propylene production and a reduction in carbon formation. DFT calculations confirm that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a smaller timescale.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括其吸热性质和焦炭的生成，后者会导致设备堵塞。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过允许较低的反应温度并有效减少焦炭形成，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择合适的氧化剂时存在自己的挑战。氧气可以完全氧化催化剂，导致丙烷的全面氧化。二氧化碳是一种较为温和的氧化剂，能够防止非选择性氧的形成，从而降低丙烷的全面氧化。二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢导致更高的丙烯选择性和碳生成的减少。基于DFT计算得到的吉布斯自由能图，在600摄氏度下，二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢受限于丙烷次级CAH键的活化，而催化剂用二氧化碳重新氧化则发生在更短的时间尺度上。
