[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
[2] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[4] "The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion."
[5] "Utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions,such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane has already been reported [22,2427]."
[6] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide based catalysts [20,2832]."
[7] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include their endothermic nature and the production of coke. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and more effective coke inhibition. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, notably a low propylene selectivity due to the risk of total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion levels. Carbon dioxide, when utilized as an oxidant in ODHP, enhances the dehydrogenation of alkanes and ethylbenzene. Nonetheless, the integration of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation processes using vanadium oxide-based catalysts is not well understood.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括它们的吸热性质和焦炭的产生。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过允许较低的反应温度和更有效的焦炭抑制，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP具有自身的一系列挑战，尤其是由于高转化率下丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化而导致的丙烯选择性低。当使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂在ODHP中时，它能增强烷烃和乙苯的脱氢。然而，将CO2集成到使用钒氧化物基催化剂的丙烷脱氢过程中，并不被充分理解。
