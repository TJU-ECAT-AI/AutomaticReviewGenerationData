[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
[2] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[4] "The primary drawback of this process is a low propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion."
[5] "Utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions,such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane has already been reported."
[6] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide based catalysts."
[7] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH), are that they are endothermic and produce coke, a carbon deposit that can clog equipment and reduce efficiency.
2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing for lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of coke formation on the surface of catalysts.
3. The main limitation of ODHP is its low selectivity towards propylene production, as it often leads to the total oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion rates.
4. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been utilized in various partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane, which has shown improvements in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide-based catalysts.
5. CO2 can enhance the dehydrogenation process, leading to more efficient production of alkenes, including propylene.
6. The role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with vanadium oxide-based catalysts is not well understood, posing a challenge for further optimization and commercialization of the process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是它们是吸热的，并且会产生焦炭，一种可以在设备中积聚并降低效率的碳沉积物。
2. 通过允许较低的反应温度和更有效的表面催化剂结焦抑制，氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）解决了这些问题。
3. ODHP的主要限制是其丙烯选择性低，在高转化率下通常导致丙烷和丙烯的完全氧化。
4. 在铬和二氧化钒基催化剂上，二氧化碳（CO2）已经在各种部分氧化反应中使用，如甲烷CO2重整和甲苯的氧化耦合，显示出对较低烷烃和乙基苯的脱氢的改进。
5. CO2可以增强脱氢过程，导致更高效的烯烃生产，包括丙烯。
6. 使用二氧化钒基催化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢过程中二氧化碳的作用尚不明确，这为过程的进一步优化和商业化带来了挑战。
