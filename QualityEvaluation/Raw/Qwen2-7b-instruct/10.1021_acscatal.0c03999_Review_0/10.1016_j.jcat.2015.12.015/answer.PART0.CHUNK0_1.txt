[1] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins. Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[2] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[3] "However, the role of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation and the mechanism of this reaction remain unclear and are dependent on the nature of the catalyst and its supporting material."
[4] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[5] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."
[6] "For V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with vanadium surface coverages below 0.5 V/nm2 (MCM-41), apparent activation energies of 122  20 kJ/mol have been measured for propylene formation."
[7] "For V2O5/Al2O3 and V2O5/ZrO2 catalysts, the apparent activation energies for propylene formation are 110120 kJ/mol and around 99 kJ/mol respectively."
[8] "For the 6.8WV catalyst, the apparent activation energy was 127  11 kJ/mol."
[9] "The reaction orders for C3H8 and CO2 were determined to be 0.82  0.17 and 0.17  0.03 respectively."
[10] "The reaction rate of propylene formation by the catalyst under the described conditions is 6 mmol/s/kg."
