[1] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation."
[2] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
[4] "Thus there is an ongoing search for a selective catalyst in this process."
[5] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
[6] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
[7] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane,while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include their endothermic nature and the production of coke, which is a byproduct that can clog equipment. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by enabling lower reaction temperatures and effectively reducing coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in selecting the appropriate oxidant. Oxygen can fully oxidize the catalyst, leading to total oxidation of propane. CO2, on the other hand, is a milder oxidant that can prevent the formation of non-selective oxygen, thus reducing total oxidation of propane. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation leads to higher selectivity towards propylene production and a reduction in carbon formation. DFT calculations confirm that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is the rate-limiting step in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a smaller timescale.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括其吸热性质和焦炭的生成，后者会导致设备堵塞。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过允许较低的反应温度并有效减少焦炭形成，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择合适的氧化剂时存在自己的挑战。氧气可以完全氧化催化剂，导致丙烷的全面氧化。二氧化碳是一种较为温和的氧化剂，能够防止非选择性氧的形成，从而降低丙烷的全面氧化。二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢导致更高的丙烯选择性和碳生成的减少。基于DFT计算得到的吉布斯自由能图，在600摄氏度下，二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢受限于丙烷次级CAH键的活化，而催化剂用二氧化碳重新氧化则发生在更短的时间尺度上。

Answer: The main challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH), include being endothermic processes that produce coke as a byproduct. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower reaction temperatures and more effective coke inhibition. However, ODHP faces the limitation of low propylene selectivity due to the risk of complete oxidation of propane and propylene at high conversion levels. The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) enhances the performance of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in ODHP, improving selectivity towards propylene and reducing carbon formation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can enhance the dehydrogenation of alkanes and ethylbenzene, but its role in oxidative dehydrogenation and the reaction mechanism are still unclear and depend on the nature of the catalyst and supporting material. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, capable of re-oxidizing catalysts to V2O4 instead of V2O5, which helps to suppress the formation of surface carbon. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale. 

Answer: 近期，丙烯需求预计将显著增加。传统的丙烯生产方法，如裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢化（DH），存在热力学耗能和焦炭生成的问题。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过使用分子氧作为氧化剂提供了一种替代方法，可以降低反应温度并有效抑制表面焦炭形成。然而，ODHP的主要挑战在于其较低的丙烯选择性，因为在高转化率下，丙烷和丙烯可能发生完全氧化。钨氧化物（WOx）的添加可以提高以钒氧化物为基础的催化剂在ODHP中的性能，从而提高丙烯选择性和减少碳的生成。二氧化碳（CO2）能够增强轻烷烃和乙苯的脱氢作用，但其在氧化性脱氢和反应机制方面的具体作用仍然不明确，并且取决于催化剂和支撑材料的性质。CO2作为温和的氧化剂，能够将催化剂氧化为V2O4而不是V2O5，这有助于抑制表面碳的生成。在丙烷存在CO2的情况下进行氧化性脱氢是受限于丙烷次级CAH键的活化，而催化剂用CO2重新氧化则发生在更短的时间尺度上。
