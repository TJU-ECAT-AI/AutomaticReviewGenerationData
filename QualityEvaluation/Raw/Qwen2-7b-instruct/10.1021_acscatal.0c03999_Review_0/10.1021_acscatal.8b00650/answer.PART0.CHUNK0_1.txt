1. Current propylene production methods often rely on steam reforming, which can be energy-intensive and may require significant amounts of water. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative approach that could potentially reduce energy consumption and water usage. While oxygen is commonly used as an oxidant due to its high reactivity and environmental benefits, its presence can lead to decreased propylene yields in the presence of water vapor. On the other hand, hydrogen chloride (HCl) as an oxidant can enhance the ODHP process. The use of ceria (CeO2) and nickel oxide (NiO)-modified ceria nanocrystals as catalysts for ODHP with HCl shows improved activity and selectivity for propylene production compared to pure ceria. The addition of NiO enhances the oxygen activation and promotes the dehydrogenation reaction. However, the use of HCl introduces challenges such as corrosion and safety concerns.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法通常依赖蒸汽重整，这可能消耗大量能量并可能需要大量水。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种替代方法，可能能够降低能源消耗和水使用量。虽然由于其高反应性和环境效益，氧气通常用作氧化剂，但在存在水蒸气的情况下，其存在可能导致丙烯产量降低。另一方面，氢氯（HCl）作为氧化剂可以增强ODHP过程。铈（CeO2）和镍氧化物（NiO）修饰的铈氧化物纳米晶作为ODHP与HCl的催化剂显示出与纯铈相比改善的活性和选择性以生成丙烯。添加NiO增强了氧激活并促进了脱氢反应。然而，使用HCl引入了腐蚀和安全问题等挑战。
