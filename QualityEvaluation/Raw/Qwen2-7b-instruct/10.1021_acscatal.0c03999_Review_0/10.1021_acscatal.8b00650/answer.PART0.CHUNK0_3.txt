The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and potential environmental impact due to the reliance on fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. When selecting oxygen as the oxidant for ODHP, challenges arise from its high reactivity, which can lead to unwanted side reactions. Specifically, the use of oxygen in ODHP presents risks such as the production of undesirable byproducts and the possibility of over-oxidation, converting propane to carbon dioxide instead of propylene.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是高能耗和潜在的环境影响，由于依赖化石燃料。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供可能更节能和更环保的替代方案来解决这些问题。在选择氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂时，其高度反应性导致了不希望出现的副反应。具体来说，在使用氧气进行ODHP时，存在产生不期望的副产品的风险以及过氧化的可能性，将丙烷转化为二氧化碳而不是丙烯。
