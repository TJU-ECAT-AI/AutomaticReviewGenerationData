The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and environmental impacts due to reliance on fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient approach. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial as it impacts reaction kinetics and product selectivity. When using oxygen, a significant challenge is its high reactivity with carbon species, potentially leading to unwanted side reactions. Catalysts are essential in ODHP processes, affecting both the efficiency and selectivity of the reaction.
