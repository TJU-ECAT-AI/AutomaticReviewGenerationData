Propylene production faces challenges such as high energy consumption and environmental concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by being more energy-efficient, though it has its own challenges, especially in selecting an effective oxidant. Oxygen is considered as a potential oxidant in this process. In this research, CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals were utilized as catalysts for ODHP in the presence of HCl.

当前丙烯生产面临挑战，包括高能消耗和温室气体排放带来的环境问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提高能效来解决这些问题，尽管它也存在自己的挑战，特别是在选择有效氧化剂方面。氧气被视为潜在的氧化剂。在本研究中，使用CeO2和NiO改性的CeO2纳米晶作为催化剂，在HCl的存在下进行ODHP。
