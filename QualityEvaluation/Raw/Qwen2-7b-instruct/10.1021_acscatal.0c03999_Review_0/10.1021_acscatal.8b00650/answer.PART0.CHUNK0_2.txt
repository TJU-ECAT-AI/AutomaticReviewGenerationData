[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is considered as a promising technology for propylene production due to its high selectivity, energy efficiency, and lower CO2 emissions compared to traditional methods."
[2] "However, one of the main challenges in ODHP is the selection of appropriate oxidants, such as oxygen or hydrogen chloride (HCl), which affects the reaction kinetics and product distribution."
[3] "The use of HCl as an oxidant has been proposed as an alternative to oxygen because it can enhance the dehydrogenation reaction rate and improve propylene yield."
[4] "CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals have been investigated as catalysts for ODHP in the presence of HCl due to their unique properties, such as high surface area and excellent catalytic activity."
[5] "In the study, the researchers synthesized CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals and evaluated their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene under various conditions."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, potential safety hazards, and environmental impacts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering high selectivity, improved energy efficiency, and reduced CO2 emissions. However, selecting the right oxidant, whether it's oxygen or hydrogen chloride (HCl), presents its own set of challenges related to reaction kinetics and product distribution. HCl as an oxidant has been proposed as an alternative to oxygen because it can increase the dehydrogenation reaction rate and enhance propylene yield. In this context, CeO2 and NiO-modified CeO2 nanocrystals were studied as catalysts for ODHP in the presence of HCl due to their unique properties, including high surface area and superior catalytic activity.
