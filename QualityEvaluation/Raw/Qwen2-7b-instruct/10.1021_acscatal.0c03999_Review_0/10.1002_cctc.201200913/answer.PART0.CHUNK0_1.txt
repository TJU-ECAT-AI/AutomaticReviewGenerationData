[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."
[2] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
[3] "The highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
[4] "The chemistry described in this work is a new pathway that increases the previous best yield of 30% for propane conversion to propylene to 80%."
[5] "The highest yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30%."
[6] "The interplay between bromine and iodine plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation."

Propylene production via current methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, suffers from low selectivity and yields due to propylene being a by-product. Propane dehydrogenation offers a potentially more efficient route for propylene production, characterized by high selectivity and low reliance on naphtha prices. However, the highest reported yield for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is around 30%, primarily due to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products. The research detailed in the document introduces a novel pathway that significantly enhances the yield of propane conversion to propylene, achieving up to 80%. This dual halogen process involving bromine and iodine demonstrates advantages over traditional methods and offers promise for developing low-temperature, high-yield propylene technologies.

当前的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，由于丙烯是副产品，因此选择性和产量一直很低。丙烷脱氢被认为是一种理想的丙烯生产途径，因为它具有理论上的高丙烯选择性和低资本投资，并且丙烯的生产成本与石脑油价格无关。然而，报道的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的最高产率仅为约30%，主要原因是丙烯连续氧化为氧代产物。文中所述的研究介绍了一种新的途径，显著提高了丙烷转化为丙烯的最高产率，从30%提升到80%。这种双卤素过程涉及溴和碘，显示了与传统方法相比的优势，并为开发低温、高产率的丙烯技术提供了前景。
