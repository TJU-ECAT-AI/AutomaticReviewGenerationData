[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[2] "However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
[4] "However, very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."
[5] "Despite these disadvantages, several propane dehydrogenation processes have been commercialized, including the Catofin process developed by Lummus and the Oleflex process developed by UOP."
[6] "The highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
[7] "Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."
[8] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br."
[9] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

Answer: 
Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

主要的丙烯生产方法包括蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，这些方法的丙烯选择性和产率一直很低。由于理论上的高丙烯选择性和低资本投入，以及丙烯生产成本与石脑油价格无关，丙烷脱氢被认为是一种理想的丙烯生产途径。然而，为了实现高单次转化率，需要高达1000K的极高反应温度。已经开发了商业化的丙烷脱氢过程，如Lummus开发的Catofin过程和UOP开发的Oleflex过程，但仍面临局限性，包括低丙烯产率。碘基氧化脱氢选择性很高，但需要很高的反应温度（900K）来获得良好的产率，并且碘的价格昂贵，不适合工业应用。溴虽然更易反应，但在丙烯和丙烷七溴化物的选择性上较低。通过混合使用低碘含量的溴和碘，研究实现了在低于800K的温和温度下达到80%的单次产率，这代表了之前产率的显著提高，并为开发低温、高产率的丙烯技术提供了前景。
