[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[2] "However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
[3] "Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."
[4] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br."
[5] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."
[6] "The highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
[7] "Propane reacts readily with halogens, producing propyl halides. A subsequent elimination process produces propylene."
[8] "The formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2 is similar to the formation of CH2Br2 in methane bromination."
[9] "Iodine can also improve the methane conversion and CH3Br selectivity in the methane bromination process."
[10] "As stated above, both C3H8 conversion and C3H6+C3H7X selectivity reach constant values above 723K without I2. Interestingly, and in contrast, in the presence of I2, both C3H8 conversion and C3H6+C3H7X selectivity increase with reaction temperature."
[11] "Compared to the less-selective bromine process and the high-temperature, expensive iodine process, a dual halogen process involving both bromine and iodine displays the advantages of both halogens."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low propylene selectivity and yield in steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene selectivity and yield. However, ODHP faces its own set of challenges, primarily related to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, limiting the highest reported yield to around 30%. Additionally, the iodine process, though highly selective, requires excessively high reaction temperatures and is too costly for industrial use. Bromine, despite being a more reactive oxidant, is less selective towards propane. The use of bromine and iodine mixtures, with iodine content not exceeding 20%, results in up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, making it a promising approach for developing low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

The challenges in propylene production involve low selectivity and yield in traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) aims to improve these by potentially enhancing propylene selectivity and yield. However, it encounters difficulties due to the sequential oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, leading to a maximum reported yield of about 30%. The iodine process, while highly selective, necessitates high reaction temperatures and is economically unfeasible for industrial applications. Bromine, though more reactive, shows reduced selectivity towards propane. The incorporation of bromine and iodine mixtures with iodine content up to 20% enables a single-pass yield of up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, offering a viable solution for developing low-temperature, high-efficiency propylene production.

Propylene production currently relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which exhibit low propylene selectivity and yield. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) seeks to rectify these issues by potentially achieving higher propylene selectivity and yield. Nevertheless, ODHP confronts its own hurdles, chiefly the sequential oxidation of propylene to oxygenated compounds, limiting the highest recorded yield to approximately 30%. The iodine process, although highly selective, demands high reaction temperatures and is excessively expensive for industrial deployment. Bromine, while a more reactive oxidant, shows reduced selectivity towards propane. The utilization of bromine and iodine mixtures, with iodine content not surpassing 20%, results in up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, marking a promising avenue for developing low-temperature, high-yield propylene production technologies.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解过程中的低丙烯选择性和产率。氧化脱氢法（ODH）通过可能提供更高的丙烯选择性和产率来解决这些问题。然而，ODH面临着自身的挑战，主要与丙烯连续氧化为氧代产物有关，这限制了最高报道的产率约为30%。此外，虽然碘化物过程高度选择性，但需要非常高的反应温度，并且成本过高，不适合工业应用。溴化物，尽管更为活性的氧化剂，但在选择性上对丙烷较低。将溴化物和碘化物混合使用，其中碘化物含量不超过20%，在中等温度下可实现高达80%的单次转化率C3H6+C3H7X，这是开发低温、高产率丙烯生产技术的有前景的方法。
