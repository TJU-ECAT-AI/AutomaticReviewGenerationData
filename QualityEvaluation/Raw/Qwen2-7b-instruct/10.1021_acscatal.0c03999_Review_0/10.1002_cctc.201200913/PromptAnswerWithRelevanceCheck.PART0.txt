[3] "The highest yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30%."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
[5] "Despite these disadvantages, several propane dehydrogenation processes have been commercialized, including the Catofin process developed by Lummus and the Oleflex process developed by UOP."

Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, which often yield propylene as a by-product with low selectivity and output. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative route, aiming for higher propylene selectivity and lower capital investment. The theoretical benefits of ODHP, however, have faced practical limitations, with reported yields for propane conversion to propylene typically around 30%. To address these challenges, researchers have explored the use of halogens as oxidants, specifically focusing on the halogen-mediated propane to propylene process. This process involves propane reacting with halogens to produce propyl halides, which undergo subsequent elimination to yield propylene and hydrogen halides. While halogen usage presents its own set of challenges, such as the high reactivity of fluorine and chlorine, and the slow reaction kinetics of iodine, the integration of bromine and iodine in a dual-halogen process has shown promise. By combining the reactivity of bromine with the selectivity of iodine, this approach enables a high single-pass yield of up to 80% for propane conversion to propylene, at moderate reaction temperatures. This development represents a significant advancement towards achieving a low-temperature, high-yield propylene production technology, which could extend beyond propylene to the synthesis of other valuable unsaturated hydrocarbons, including olefins, diolefins, and aromatics.

传统的丙烯生产主要依赖于蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解，这些过程往往将丙烯作为副产品产生，并且选择性和产量都很低。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种替代途径，旨在提高丙烯的选择性和降低资本投资。尽管ODHP理论上具有优势，但其实际应用中面临的挑战导致报道的丙烷转化为丙烯的产率通常只有30%左右。为了解决这些挑战，研究人员探索了卤素作为氧化剂的应用，特别是关注卤素介导的丙烷到丙烯过程。该过程涉及丙烷与卤素反应生成丙基卤化物，随后通过消除过程产生丙烯和卤化氢。虽然卤素使用面临高反应性氟和氯以及碘低温反应速率慢的问题，但在溴和碘的双卤化物过程中结合这两种元素显示出巨大的潜力。通过结合溴的反应性和碘的选择性，这种方法能够实现高达80%的单次转化产率，适用于丙烷转化为丙烯，且在较低的反应温度下进行。这一发展标志着向实现低温、高产率丙烯生产技术的重大进步，该技术不仅限于丙烯，还可以扩展到合成其他有价值的不饱和碳氢化合物，包括烯烃、二烯烃和芳香烃。

Propylene production via current methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, suffers from low selectivity and yields due to propylene being a by-product. Propane dehydrogenation offers a potentially more efficient route for propylene production, characterized by high selectivity and low reliance on naphtha prices. However, the highest reported yield for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is around 30%, primarily due to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products. The research detailed in the document introduces a novel pathway that significantly enhances the yield of propane conversion to propylene, achieving up to 80%. This dual halogen process involving bromine and iodine demonstrates advantages over traditional methods and offers promise for developing low-temperature, high-yield propylene technologies.

当前的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，由于丙烯是副产品，因此选择性和产量一直很低。丙烷脱氢被认为是一种理想的丙烯生产途径，因为它具有理论上的高丙烯选择性和低资本投资，并且丙烯的生产成本与石脑油价格无关。然而，报道的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODH）的最高产率仅为约30%，主要原因是丙烯连续氧化为氧代产物。文中所述的研究介绍了一种新的途径，显著提高了丙烷转化为丙烯的最高产率，从30%提升到80%。这种双卤素过程涉及溴和碘，显示了与传统方法相比的优势，并为开发低温、高产率的丙烯技术提供了前景。

1. Current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, face challenges due to low selectivity and yields. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene selectivity and yield, although it still faces limitations, such as consecutive oxidation to oxygenated products.

2. The highest reported yield for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is around 30%, mainly due to the oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products. This limits the efficiency and economic viability of the process.

3. Fluorine is not suitable for halogenation processes due to its high reactivity and thermodynamic constraints. Chlorine reacts quickly with alkanes, often leading to non-selective reactions and potential safety hazards. Iodine, while selective, reacts relatively slowly with propane at low temperatures, producing propyl iodides and propylene.

4. The use of a bromine-iodine mixture with a low iodine content (up to 20%) enables a high single-pass yield of up to 80% at moderate reaction temperatures, making it a promising approach for developing a low-temperature, on-purpose propylene technology.

5. When using bromine alone, propane conversion reaches a constant value of approximately 66% with increasing reaction temperature.

6. The presence of iodine in the reaction mixture increases both the propane conversion and the selectivity for C3H6+C3H7X products, demonstrating the synergistic effect of bromine and iodine.

7. A dual halogen process combining bromine and iodine offers the benefits of both halogens, addressing the limitations of using either halogen alone.

8. The findings are particularly promising for creating a low-temperature, high-yield propylene production method, which could be extended to synthesizing other commercially desirable unsaturated hydrocarbons.

1. 目前的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，面临选择性和产率低的问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过可能提供更高的丙烯选择性和产率来解决这些问题，尽管它仍然面临着连续氧化到氧代产物的限制。

2. 报道的最高丙烷氧化脱氢产率为大约30%，主要由于丙烯的氧化到氧代产物。这限制了该过程的效率和经济可行性。

3. 氟不适合用于卤化过程，因为它具有高反应性和热力学约束。氯与烷烃快速反应，往往导致非选择性反应和潜在的安全隐患。碘在低温下相对缓慢地与丙烷反应，产生丙基碘化物和丙烯。

4. 使用溴碘混合物，碘含量不超过20%，能够在中等反应温度下实现高达80%的单次通过产率，使其成为开发低温、定向高产丙烯技术的有前景的方法。

5. 单独使用溴时，随着反应温度的升高，丙烷转化率达到约66%的恒定值。

6. 碘的存在增加了丙烷转化率和C3H6+C3H7X产物的选择性，表明溴和碘之间的协同作用。

7. 结合溴和碘的双卤化过程提供了两种卤素的优点，解决了单独使用任一卤素的局限性。

8. 这些发现特别有希望创建一种低温、高产的丙烯生产方法，这可以扩展到合成其他商业上可取的不饱和碳氢化合物。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low propylene selectivity and yield in steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene selectivity and yield. However, ODHP faces its own set of challenges, primarily related to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, limiting the highest reported yield to around 30%. Additionally, the iodine process, though highly selective, requires excessively high reaction temperatures and is too costly for industrial use. Bromine, despite being a more reactive oxidant, is less selective towards propane. The use of bromine and iodine mixtures, with iodine content not exceeding 20%, results in up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, making it a promising approach for developing low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

The challenges in propylene production involve low selectivity and yield in traditional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) aims to improve these by potentially enhancing propylene selectivity and yield. However, it encounters difficulties due to the sequential oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products, leading to a maximum reported yield of about 30%. The iodine process, while highly selective, necessitates high reaction temperatures and is economically unfeasible for industrial applications. Bromine, though more reactive, shows reduced selectivity towards propane. The incorporation of bromine and iodine mixtures with iodine content up to 20% enables a single-pass yield of up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, offering a viable solution for developing low-temperature, high-efficiency propylene production.

Propylene production currently relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which exhibit low propylene selectivity and yield. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) seeks to rectify these issues by potentially achieving higher propylene selectivity and yield. Nevertheless, ODHP confronts its own hurdles, chiefly the sequential oxidation of propylene to oxygenated compounds, limiting the highest recorded yield to approximately 30%. The iodine process, although highly selective, demands high reaction temperatures and is excessively expensive for industrial deployment. Bromine, while a more reactive oxidant, shows reduced selectivity towards propane. The utilization of bromine and iodine mixtures, with iodine content not surpassing 20%, results in up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, marking a promising avenue for developing low-temperature, high-yield propylene production technologies.

Answer: 
Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

主要的丙烯生产方法包括蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，这些方法的丙烯选择性和产率一直很低。由于理论上的高丙烯选择性和低资本投入，以及丙烯生产成本与石脑油价格无关，丙烷脱氢被认为是一种理想的丙烯生产途径。然而，为了实现高单次转化率，需要高达1000K的极高反应温度。已经开发了商业化的丙烷脱氢过程，如Lummus开发的Catofin过程和UOP开发的Oleflex过程，但仍面临局限性，包括低丙烯产率。碘基氧化脱氢选择性很高，但需要很高的反应温度（900K）来获得良好的产率，并且碘的价格昂贵，不适合工业应用。溴虽然更易反应，但在丙烯和丙烷七溴化物的选择性上较低。通过混合使用低碘含量的溴和碘，研究实现了在低于800K的温和温度下达到80%的单次产率，这代表了之前产率的显著提高，并为开发低温、高产率的丙烯技术提供了前景。
