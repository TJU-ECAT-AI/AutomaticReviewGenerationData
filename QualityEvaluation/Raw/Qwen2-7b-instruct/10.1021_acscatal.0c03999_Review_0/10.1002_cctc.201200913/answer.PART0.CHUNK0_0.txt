[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC)."
[2] "However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."
[3] "The highest yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30%."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
[5] "Despite these disadvantages, several propane dehydrogenation processes have been commercialized, including the Catofin process developed by Lummus and the Oleflex process developed by UOP."
[6] "One possible alternative is to produce propylene through a halogen route, as illustrated in Figure1."
[7] "Halogen-mediated propane to propylene process involves propane reacting readily with halogens, producing propyl halides."
[8] "A subsequent elimination process produces propylene and hydrogen halides."
[9] "Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenation-dehydrohalogenation process."
[10] "Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur."
[11] "I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene."
[12] "The underlying chemistry might be extended to the high yield syntheses of many other unsaturated hydrocarbons, including olefins, diolefins, and aromatics."
[13] "The results are particularly promising for developing a low-temperature on-purpose, high-yield propylene technology."

Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, which often yield propylene as a by-product with low selectivity and output. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative route, aiming for higher propylene selectivity and lower capital investment. The theoretical benefits of ODHP, however, have faced practical limitations, with reported yields for propane conversion to propylene typically around 30%. To address these challenges, researchers have explored the use of halogens as oxidants, specifically focusing on the halogen-mediated propane to propylene process. This process involves propane reacting with halogens to produce propyl halides, which undergo subsequent elimination to yield propylene and hydrogen halides. While halogen usage presents its own set of challenges, such as the high reactivity of fluorine and chlorine, and the slow reaction kinetics of iodine, the integration of bromine and iodine in a dual-halogen process has shown promise. By combining the reactivity of bromine with the selectivity of iodine, this approach enables a high single-pass yield of up to 80% for propane conversion to propylene, at moderate reaction temperatures. This development represents a significant advancement towards achieving a low-temperature, high-yield propylene production technology, which could extend beyond propylene to the synthesis of other valuable unsaturated hydrocarbons, including olefins, diolefins, and aromatics.

传统的丙烯生产主要依赖于蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解，这些过程往往将丙烯作为副产品产生，并且选择性和产量都很低。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种替代途径，旨在提高丙烯的选择性和降低资本投资。尽管ODHP理论上具有优势，但其实际应用中面临的挑战导致报道的丙烷转化为丙烯的产率通常只有30%左右。为了解决这些挑战，研究人员探索了卤素作为氧化剂的应用，特别是关注卤素介导的丙烷到丙烯过程。该过程涉及丙烷与卤素反应生成丙基卤化物，随后通过消除过程产生丙烯和卤化氢。虽然卤素使用面临高反应性氟和氯以及碘低温反应速率慢的问题，但在溴和碘的双卤化物过程中结合这两种元素显示出巨大的潜力。通过结合溴的反应性和碘的选择性，这种方法能够实现高达80%的单次转化产率，适用于丙烷转化为丙烯，且在较低的反应温度下进行。这一发展标志着向实现低温、高产率丙烯生产技术的重大进步，该技术不仅限于丙烯，还可以扩展到合成其他有价值的不饱和碳氢化合物，包括烯烃、二烯烃和芳香烃。
