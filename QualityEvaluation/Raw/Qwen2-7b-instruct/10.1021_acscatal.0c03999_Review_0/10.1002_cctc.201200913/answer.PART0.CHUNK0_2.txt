1. Current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, face challenges due to low selectivity and yields. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering higher propylene selectivity and yield, although it still faces limitations, such as consecutive oxidation to oxygenated products.

2. The highest reported yield for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is around 30%, mainly due to the oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products. This limits the efficiency and economic viability of the process.

3. Fluorine is not suitable for halogenation processes due to its high reactivity and thermodynamic constraints. Chlorine reacts quickly with alkanes, often leading to non-selective reactions and potential safety hazards. Iodine, while selective, reacts relatively slowly with propane at low temperatures, producing propyl iodides and propylene.

4. The use of a bromine-iodine mixture with a low iodine content (up to 20%) enables a high single-pass yield of up to 80% at moderate reaction temperatures, making it a promising approach for developing a low-temperature, on-purpose propylene technology.

5. When using bromine alone, propane conversion reaches a constant value of approximately 66% with increasing reaction temperature.

6. The presence of iodine in the reaction mixture increases both the propane conversion and the selectivity for C3H6+C3H7X products, demonstrating the synergistic effect of bromine and iodine.

7. A dual halogen process combining bromine and iodine offers the benefits of both halogens, addressing the limitations of using either halogen alone.

8. The findings are particularly promising for creating a low-temperature, high-yield propylene production method, which could be extended to synthesizing other commercially desirable unsaturated hydrocarbons.

1. 目前的丙烯生产方法，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，面临选择性和产率低的问题。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过可能提供更高的丙烯选择性和产率来解决这些问题，尽管它仍然面临着连续氧化到氧代产物的限制。

2. 报道的最高丙烷氧化脱氢产率为大约30%，主要由于丙烯的氧化到氧代产物。这限制了该过程的效率和经济可行性。

3. 氟不适合用于卤化过程，因为它具有高反应性和热力学约束。氯与烷烃快速反应，往往导致非选择性反应和潜在的安全隐患。碘在低温下相对缓慢地与丙烷反应，产生丙基碘化物和丙烯。

4. 使用溴碘混合物，碘含量不超过20%，能够在中等反应温度下实现高达80%的单次通过产率，使其成为开发低温、定向高产丙烯技术的有前景的方法。

5. 单独使用溴时，随着反应温度的升高，丙烷转化率达到约66%的恒定值。

6. 碘的存在增加了丙烷转化率和C3H6+C3H7X产物的选择性，表明溴和碘之间的协同作用。

7. 结合溴和碘的双卤化过程提供了两种卤素的优点，解决了单独使用任一卤素的局限性。

8. 这些发现特别有希望创建一种低温、高产的丙烯生产方法，这可以扩展到合成其他商业上可取的不饱和碳氢化合物。
