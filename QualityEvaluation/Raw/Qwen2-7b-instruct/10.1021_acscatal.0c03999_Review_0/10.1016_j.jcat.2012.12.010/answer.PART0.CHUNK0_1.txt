<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising alternative method for producing propylene, offering several advantages over traditional methods. It can potentially reduce the need for fossil fuels, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, and improve energy efficiency. However, the process faces challenges related to the selection of the oxidant, particularly between oxygen and nitrogen oxides (N2O). N2O is often preferred because it offers higher selectivity and better stability, but it is less abundant and more expensive than oxygen.</p>

ODHP presents an alternative approach to propylene production that could mitigate some of the environmental concerns associated with traditional methods. By utilizing oxygen or nitrogen oxides as the oxidant, the process aims to enhance sustainability. Yet, choosing the right oxidant is crucial, as N2O, though offering higher selectivity and stability, comes with higher costs and scarcity compared to oxygen.
