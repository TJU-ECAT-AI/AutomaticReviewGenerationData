[1] "The interaction between N2O and Fe(II) ions stabilized in the extra-framework sites of high-silica zeolites results in N2O dissociation and formation of the so-called a-oxygen bound to Fe ions and gaseous nitrogen."
[2] "In contrast, both mono-, dinuclear Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(III)-oxo oligomers are reduced by propane to Fe(II) at conditions of the C3H8/N2O reaction."
[3] "The redox state of Fe in both non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 was strongly influenced by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O."
[4] "The presence of high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke."
[5] "The steaming of FeH-ZSM-5 at 600 C resulted in a low concentration of Fe(II) ions and Fe-oxo species in the cationic sites. Predominant part of Fe was Td-coordinated Fe(III) (4347%) bound within extra-framework FeAAlASi species, and as Fe-oxide particles (3033%)."

1. The interaction between N2O and Fe(II) ions in high-silica zeolites leads to N2O dissociation and the formation of a-oxygen bound to Fe ions and gaseous nitrogen.
2. Mono-, dinuclear Fe(III)-oxo and Fe(III)-oxo oligomers are reduced by propane to Fe(II) under conditions of C3H8/N2O reaction.
3. The redox state of Fe in Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly affected by the reaction conditions of N2O decomposition and C3H8/N2O.
4. A high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 facilitated the oligomerization of formed propene, reducing its yield and increasing the retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke.
5. Steaming FeH-ZSM-5 at 600°C decreased the concentration of Fe(II) ions and Fe-oxo species in the cationic sites. The predominant part of Fe became Td-coordinated Fe(III) bound within extra-framework FeAAlASi species and as Fe-oxide particles.

1. N2O与高硅氧石中的Fe(II)离子之间的相互作用导致N2O分解，并形成附着在Fe离子上的a-oxygen以及氮气。
2. 在C3H8/N2O反应条件下，单核、二核Fe(III)-氧化物和Fe(III)-氧化物寡聚体被丙烷还原为Fe(II)。
3. Fe-ZSM-5中Fe的还原状态受到N2O分解和C3H8/N2O反应条件的影响。
4. FeH-ZSM-5中较高的Brnsted位点浓度和较大的晶体尺寸促进了形成丙烯的寡聚化，降低了其产率并增加了聚烯烃的保留至聚芳烃焦炭。
5. 将FeH-ZSM-5蒸煮至600°C导致Fe(II)离子和c型位点的Fe-氧化物种浓度降低。大部分Fe成为TD-配位的Fe(III)，位于额外框架FeAAlASi物种中，以及作为Fe-氧化物颗粒。
