[1] "The catalytic systems based on chromium, along with platinum-containing systems, are the main industrial catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light paraffins [1]."
[2] "Commercially implemented CrOx/Al2O3 systems are characterized by high coke deposition during operation [2], which reduces their activity and necessitates the use of cyclic regeneration procedures."
[3] "The acidity of the GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 systems was not considered in detail, although acid sites, especially, Lewis sites, are places for the strong adsorption of olefins, which provoke their further polymerization and coke deposition."
[4] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas [1]."
[5] "Studies of the effect of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation reactions of C2C4 paraffins on chromium oxide catalysts are promising lines in the development of these processes because they have shown a positive effect of CO2 on both the activity and the yield of olefins [39]."
[6] "Despite a large number of studies, many questions related to the basic, acidbase, and oxidationreduction properties of catalysts and carriers and the mech- anisms of the reactions remain open questions."
[7] "In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems."
[8] "In contrast to the chromium oxide systems, a considerable decrease in the conversion of CO2 in the first hour of operation was not observed in the dehydroge- nation of propane on the gallium oxide catalysts, thus conversion decreased almost three times for ten working hours."
[9] "The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[10] "In the case of CrOx/SiO2 at 600C, chromium was rapidly reduced to the oxidation states 2+ and 3+ depending on the particle size. In this case, the large agglomer- ate of CrOx (mainly Cr2O3) was very difficult to reoxidize; ions within these agglomerates were inaccessible to oxygen and, obviously, propane, and they did almost not participate in dehydrogenation."

1. Chromium and platinum-containing systems are the primary industrial catalysts for light paraffin dehydrogenation. Commercial chromium oxide on aluminum oxide systems suffer from high coke deposition, necessitating cyclic regeneration.

2. Acid sites, particularly Lewis sites, play a crucial role in olefin adsorption, leading to polymerization and coke formation. The acidity of the catalysts and supports affects dehydrogenation efficiency.

3. Carbon dioxide can prevent deep oxidation reactions when used as an additive and can efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas. It has a positive impact on the activity and yield of olefins in dehydrogenation processes.

4. Many fundamental questions regarding catalyst and carrier properties, their acid-base and redox behavior, and reaction mechanisms remain unresolved despite extensive research.

5. The insufficient dispersity of the active phase in gallium oxide catalysts is responsible for their low specific activity. 

6. Gallium oxide catalysts show different behavior compared to chromium oxide catalysts when CO2 is present. The introduction of CO2 leads to a decrease in the conversion of CO2, impacting the yield of olefins.

7. Low-acidity silicate supports can reduce coke formation and extend the operational time of chromium and gallium oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation processes.

8. At high temperatures and in a reducing atmosphere, chromium oxide aggregates become difficult to reoxidize, limiting their participation in dehydrogenation reactions.
