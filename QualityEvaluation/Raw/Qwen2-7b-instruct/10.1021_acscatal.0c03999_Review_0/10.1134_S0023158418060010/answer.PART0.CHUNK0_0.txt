[1] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occurrence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[2] "It was established that CO2 hindered the adsorption of propane on the surface of catalysts to decrease its conversion; at the same time, it prevented the adsorption of propylene and its further conversion into coke."
[3] "In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[4] "In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."

1. CO2 can be used as an additive in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) processes to avoid deep oxidation reactions that occur when oxygen is introduced, and to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas.

2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) hinders the adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface, decreasing its conversion rate. It also prevents the adsorption of propylene and its further conversion into coke.

3. In chromium oxide catalysts, the increase in propylene yield and the stability of operation, due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2, outweighs any negative effects.

4. For gallium oxide catalysts, the introduction of CO2 complicates the formation of propylene, leading to a decrease in its yield.

5. In chromium oxide systems, the benefits of increased propylene yield and stable operation from the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon CO2 introduction surpass the negative impact.

1. 在氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程中，可以使用CO2作为添加剂来避免引入氧气时发生的深度氧化反应，并且可以高效利用这种温室气体。

2. CO2阻碍丙烷在催化剂表面的吸附，降低其转化率。它还阻止丙烯的吸附及其进一步转化为焦炭。

3. 对于铬氧化物催化剂，通过在引入CO2时氧化焦炭和氢气，增加丙烯产量和操作稳定性的好处超过了负面影响。

4. 对于镓氧化物催化剂，引入CO2使丙烯的形成复杂化，导致其产量下降。

5. 对于铬氧化物系统，在引入CO2时氧化焦炭和氢气带来的丙烯产量增加和稳定操作的好处超过了负面影响。
