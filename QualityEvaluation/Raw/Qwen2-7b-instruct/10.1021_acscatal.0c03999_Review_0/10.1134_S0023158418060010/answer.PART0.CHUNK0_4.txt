[1] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occur- rence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[2] "In the case of the gallium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[3] "Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption."
[4] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over the negative influence."

1. The use of CO2 as an additive in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) helps to avoid deep oxidation reactions that occur when oxygen is introduced, making it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas.
2. In gallium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon CO2 introduction outweighs any negative effects.
3. Carbon dioxide prevents olefin polymerization by avoiding their adsorption, which decreases propane conversion by preventing its adsorption.
4. In chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to CO2-induced oxidation of coke and hydrogen prevails over negative influences.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中使用二氧化碳作为添加剂，可以避免引入氧气时发生的深度氧化反应，并且有可能高效利用这种温室气体。
2. 对于镓系统，在CO2引入后导致的焦炭和氢气的氧化使得丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高，这比任何负面影响都要重要。
3. 二氧化碳通过避免烯烃吸附来阻止烯烃聚合，从而减少丙烷的转化，因为这样也能防止丙烷的吸附。
4. 对于铬系统，在CO2引入后导致的焦炭和氢气氧化使得丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高，这比负面影响更为显著。
