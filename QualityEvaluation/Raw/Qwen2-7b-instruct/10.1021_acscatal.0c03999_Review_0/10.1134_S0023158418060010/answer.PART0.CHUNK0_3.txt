[1] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[2] "At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface."
[3] "The introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[4] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over the negative influence."
[5] "In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Using low-acidity silicate supports in catalyst preparation reduces coke formation and increases effective operation times for chromium and gallium systems.
2. Acid hydroxyls on these supports contribute to the formation of a dispersed active surface.
3. Carbon dioxide acts as both an oxidizer for hydrogen and coke and competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces during propane dehydrogenation.
4. In chromium systems, the introduction of carbon dioxide enhances propylene yield and stability by oxidizing coke and hydrogen, outweighing negative effects.
5. For gallium systems, adding carbon dioxide complicates propylene formation and decreases its yield.

1. 使用低酸度硅酸盐支持物在催化剂制备中，可以减少焦炭形成并增加铬和镓系统的有效操作时间。
2. 这些支持物上的酸羟基对形成分散活性表面起着重要作用。
3. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳既作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，也与碳氢化合物竞争吸附在催化剂表面上。
4. 对于铬系统，向系统中引入二氧化碳通过氧化焦炭和氢气增加了丙烯产量和稳定性，从而抵消了负面影响。
5. 对于镓系统，向系统中添加二氧化碳会复杂化丙烯的形成，并降低其产量。
