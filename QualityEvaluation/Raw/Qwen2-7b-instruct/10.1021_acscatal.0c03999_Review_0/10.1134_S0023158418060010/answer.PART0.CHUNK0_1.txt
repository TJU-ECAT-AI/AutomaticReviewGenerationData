[1] "The use of low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation decreased coke formation and increased the effective operation times of Cr- and Ga-containing systems."
[2] "The introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy consumption and environmental impact associated with traditional processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. It reduces the need for high temperatures and pressures typically required in conventional methods, leading to lower energy consumption. Additionally, ODHP enables the direct conversion of abundant propane resources into propylene, a key chemical feedstock, thereby enhancing resource utilization.

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges. The selection of an appropriate oxidant is crucial, with oxygen being commonly used but also posing risks due to potential deep oxidation reactions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has emerged as a safer alternative, avoiding deep oxidation reactions and efficiently utilizing a greenhouse gas. Using CO2 in ODHP also reduces the risk of oxygen-related safety hazards.

In the context of using oxidants, CO2 offers several advantages over oxygen. It is less reactive, minimizing the risk of unwanted reactions. Moreover, CO2 is abundant and can be readily captured from industrial processes, making it an economically viable option. The competitive adsorption of CO2 with hydrocarbons, as noted in the text, demonstrates that CO2 can effectively prevent the adsorption of olefins, thus decreasing their conversion and potentially complicating the formation of propylene. This effect is more pronounced in gallium-based catalysts, leading to a slight decrease in propylene yield.

In chromium-based systems, the introduction of CO2 leads to an increase in the yield of propylene and operational stability due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen. This positive effect outweighs the negative influence, highlighting the benefits of using CO2 in ODHP processes.

In summary, ODHP provides a promising pathway for propylene production, addressing some of the traditional challenges through more efficient energy usage and resource optimization. However, careful consideration of oxidant selection and understanding the interactions between reactants and catalysts are essential to maximize process efficiency and product yield.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括传统工艺中高能耗和环境影响的问题。氧化脱氢法（ODHP）通过提供更高效、更环保的替代方案来解决这些问题。它减少了常规方法所需的高温高压需求，从而降低了能源消耗。此外，ODHP允许直接将丰富的丙烷资源转化为丙烯，关键的化学原料，从而提高了资源利用率。

然而，ODHP也存在自己的挑战。选择合适的氧化剂至关重要，通常使用氧气，但也存在风险，因为可能会发生潜在的深度氧化反应。二氧化碳（CO2）作为一种更安全的选择出现，避免了深度氧化反应，并有效地利用了一种温室气体。在使用ODHP时，采用CO2可以减少与氧气相关的安全风险。

从使用氧化剂的角度来看，CO2相对于氧气具有几个优势。它反应性较低，最大限度地减少了不希望发生的反应的风险。此外，CO2大量存在于工业过程中，可以轻易捕获，使其成为经济可行的选择。在丙烷脱氢过程中，CO2与碳氢化合物的竞争吸附显示，CO2能够有效防止烯烃的吸附，从而降低它们的转化率，并可能使丙烯的形成变得复杂，导致丙烯产量略有下降。

对于铬基系统而言，引入CO2导致丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高，由于焦炭和氢气的氧化。这种正面影响超过了负面影响，突出了在ODHP过程中使用CO2的优势。

综上所述，ODHP为丙烯生产提供了一个有前景的途径，通过更高效的能源使用和资源优化解决了传统方法的一些挑战。但是，仔细考虑氧化剂选择以及反应物与催化剂之间的相互作用是至关重要的，以最大化过程效率和产品产率。
