[1] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."
[2] "Most recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as an outstanding catalyst for O2ODHP with high C3H6 selectivity (e.g., 79% selectivity with 14% C3H8 conversion at 490 C) and well-suppressed overoxidation."
[3] "To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides."

[6] "Presently, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include a supply deficit due to increased market demand and inherent drawbacks of the dehydrogenation process, such as thermodynamic limits requiring high-energy input and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by being exothermic, thus avoiding thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, using oxygen (O2) as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, causing inefficiencies and low selectivity.

2. Soft oxidants like CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are alternatives to O2 in ODHP, aiming to replace O2 and mitigate overoxidation issues. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for ODHP with high selectivity and suppressed overoxidation.

3. The use of soft oxidants in ODHP offers environmental and sustainability benefits by directly utilizing them for chemical conversion to reduce or mitigate acid-gas emissions. This approach adds value to ODHP reactions beyond just propylene production.

4. Concerns about process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist, which might hinder practical implementation. Alternative approaches focus on introducing soft oxidants to replace O2, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, which offer additional environmental and energy benefits.

5. ODHP reactions with soft oxidants, including CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides, have been studied, particularly CO2-/NOx-assisted ODHP, which has seen significant efforts in developing supported metal oxide catalysts. The roles of different soft oxidants vary among catalysts, affecting their composition, structure, and catalytic performance.

6. Soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are potential promoters for ODHP reactions, offering advantages such as shifting reaction equilibria, reoxidizing catalysts, removing coke, serving as cocatalysts, and possessing competitive adsorption against C3H8.

7. The development of alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production is motivated by the growing propylene gap between market demand and productivity, as well as continuously increasing environmental concerns. This necessitates timely analysis and summarization of the literature to highlight current progress in catalyst development for alkane conversion utilizing soft oxidants.

8. Soft oxidants like CO2 and N2O have been studied in the context of ODHP, with a focus on the relationship between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, as well as the influence of the nature of the support on activity and selectivity.

9. The feasibility of utilizing sulfur as an oxidant in ODHP has not been well explored, despite its potential as a promoter for the reaction. Sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are common co-contaminants in natural gas, necessitating significant effort to realize the feasibility of sulfur-assisted ODHP.

10. Recent interest in catalytic oxychlorination over metal phosphate (e.g., CrPO4 and FePO4) and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides (e.g., CeO2 and EuOCl) has led to propylene yields up to 55% at 500°C, correlating with the ability of catalysts to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2. This chemistry is found to be largely related to the catalytic properties of these materials in oxychlorination processes.
