The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the thermodynamic limit imposed by the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation process, which necessitates high-energy input, and the rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an exothermic reaction pathway that is free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen (O2) as an oxidant in ODHP leads to inefficiencies and low selectivity due to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides. To overcome this, alternative soft oxidants such as CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are being explored for ODHP. While there have been reviews on CO2-assisted ODHP focusing on its feasibility across multiple reactions, detailed studies on catalyst development for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP remain scarce.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括脱氢过程的热力学限制，这需要高能量输入，以及由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失效。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一个在较低温度下不受热力学约束的放热反应途径，解决了这些问题。然而，使用氧气（O2）作为氧化剂在ODHP中会导致效率低下和低选择性，因为会过氧化烯烃生成二氧化碳。为了克服这个问题，正在探索使用CO2、NOx、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂进行ODHP。尽管已经有关于使用CO2辅助ODHP的综述主要关注其在多个反应中的可行性，但对于其他软氧化剂辅助ODHP的催化剂开发的研究仍然很少。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the thermodynamic limit for propylene conversion, which demands high-energy input, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an exothermic process that operates at lower temperatures, thus avoiding the thermodynamic limitations encountered in traditional methods. While ODHP presents advantages such as reduced energy requirements and potential for high propylene yields, it faces limitations, notably the risk of overoxidation when using oxygen (O2) as an oxidant, which can lead to inefficient reactant usage and low process selectivity. To overcome the flammability concerns associated with O2, alternative soft oxidants like CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides have been explored. These soft oxidants offer opportunities for chemical conversion, reducing or mitigating acid-gas emissions and enhancing sustainability. Despite progress in developing catalysts for ODHP with soft oxidants, there remains a lack of focus on detailed reaction mechanisms and active site studies for certain oxidants, particularly sulfur and halogen compounds. The growing demand for propylene and environmental concerns drive the need for alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production. This review summarizes recent advancements in catalyst development for alkane conversion using soft oxidants, highlighting the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance based on reported kinetic and characterization data.

CO2-, NOx-, and sulfur-assisted ODHP reactions have received significant attention, with efforts focusing on developing supported metal oxide catalysts, including redox-type transition metal oxides and main group metal oxides with non-redox properties. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support. In contrast, studies on sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP are scarce, indicating a need for further investigation into active sites, structure, composition, and reaction mechanisms for these soft oxidants. Sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are common contaminants in natural gas, necessitating significant effort to realize the feasibility of sulfur-assisted ODHP processes. Recent advancements in oxychlorination chemistry, using metal phosphates and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides, have demonstrated promising propylene yields, highlighting the potential of these catalysts for efficient ODHP reactions. The ability of these catalysts to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2 is crucial for the oxychlorination process, which is found to be closely related to the catalyst's capacity for oxidizing HCl.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括丙烯转化的热力学限制，这需要高能量输入，以及由于焦炭形成而迅速催化剂失活。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供在较低温度下运行的放热过程来解决这些问题，从而避免了传统方法遇到的热力学限制。尽管ODHP提供了降低能耗和可能获得高丙烯产量的优势，但它面临着使用氧气（O2）作为氧化剂时的风险，这可能导致反应物效率低下和低工艺选择性。为了克服与O2相关的火焰安全问题，探索了CO2、NOx、硫化物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂。这些软氧化剂为化学转换提供了机会，减少了或减轻了酸性气体排放，并增强了可持续性。尽管已经取得了使用软氧化剂进行烷烃转换的催化剂开发方面的进展，但对某些氧化剂的详细反应机制和活性位点研究仍不足，特别是对于硫化物和卤素化合物。不断增长的丙烯需求和环境担忧推动了使用软氧化剂进行可持续化学生产的替代方法的需求。本综述总结了近年来在软氧化剂辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中催化剂开发的最新进展，根据报道的动力学和表征数据提供了催化剂组成、结构与催化性能之间的关系概述。

CO2、NOx和硫化物辅助的ODHP反应已经收到了大量关注，努力集中在开发包括可逆型过渡金属氧化物和支持型主族金属氧化物在内的支持金属氧化物催化剂上，其中后者具有非可逆性质（例如铁）。这些催化剂的性能受到活性物种分散性和支持物性质的影响。相比之下，对于硫化物辅助的DHP和ODHP的研究较少，表明需要进一步调查这些软氧化剂的活性位点、结构、组成和反应机制。硫化物，如H2S，是天然气中的常见污染物，需要大量努力来实现硫化物辅助ODHP过程的可行性。最近在使用金属磷酸盐和稀土金属氧化物/氧氯化物的氧氯化反应中取得的进展表明，最高可达55%的丙烯产率可以在500°C下获得，这突出了这些催化剂在高效ODHP反应中的潜力。这些催化剂氧化HCl生成分子Cl2的能力对于氧氯化过程至关重要，该过程发现与催化剂氧化HCl的能力密切相关。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include a supply deficit due to increased market demand and inherent drawbacks of the dehydrogenation process, such as thermodynamic limits requiring high-energy input and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by being exothermic, thus avoiding thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, using oxygen (O2) as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides, causing inefficiencies and low selectivity.

2. Soft oxidants like CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are alternatives to O2 in ODHP, aiming to replace O2 and mitigate overoxidation issues. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as a promising catalyst for ODHP with high selectivity and suppressed overoxidation.

3. The use of soft oxidants in ODHP offers environmental and sustainability benefits by directly utilizing them for chemical conversion to reduce or mitigate acid-gas emissions. This approach adds value to ODHP reactions beyond just propylene production.

4. Concerns about process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist, which might hinder practical implementation. Alternative approaches focus on introducing soft oxidants to replace O2, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, which offer additional environmental and energy benefits.

5. ODHP reactions with soft oxidants, including CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides, have been studied, particularly CO2-/NOx-assisted ODHP, which has seen significant efforts in developing supported metal oxide catalysts. The roles of different soft oxidants vary among catalysts, affecting their composition, structure, and catalytic performance.

6. Soft oxidants like CO2, N2O, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are potential promoters for ODHP reactions, offering advantages such as shifting reaction equilibria, reoxidizing catalysts, removing coke, serving as cocatalysts, and possessing competitive adsorption against C3H8.

7. The development of alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production is motivated by the growing propylene gap between market demand and productivity, as well as continuously increasing environmental concerns. This necessitates timely analysis and summarization of the literature to highlight current progress in catalyst development for alkane conversion utilizing soft oxidants.

8. Soft oxidants like CO2 and N2O have been studied in the context of ODHP, with a focus on the relationship between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, as well as the influence of the nature of the support on activity and selectivity.

9. The feasibility of utilizing sulfur as an oxidant in ODHP has not been well explored, despite its potential as a promoter for the reaction. Sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are common co-contaminants in natural gas, necessitating significant effort to realize the feasibility of sulfur-assisted ODHP.

10. Recent interest in catalytic oxychlorination over metal phosphate (e.g., CrPO4 and FePO4) and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides (e.g., CeO2 and EuOCl) has led to propylene yields up to 55% at 500°C, correlating with the ability of catalysts to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于市场需求快速增长导致的供应不足，以及转化过程的热力学限制需要高能输入和催化剂快速失活。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一个在较低温度下不受热力学约束的放热过程，解决了这些问题。然而，使用氧气（O2）作为氧化剂可能导致烯烃过氧化，降低反应物的利用率和产物选择性。最近在催化剂方面的进展，如六方氮化硼（h-BN），已经提高了使用O2进行ODHP的选择性。正在探索的软氧化剂，如二氧化碳、NOx、硫化合物和卤素/卤化物，旨在克服O2带来的火灾风险，并进一步提高ODHP过程的可持续性和效率。
