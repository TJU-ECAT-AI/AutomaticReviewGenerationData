[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry."
[2] "However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."
[3] "Presently, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[4] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."
[5] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."
[6] "Most recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as an outstanding catalyst for O2ODHP with high C3H6 selectivity (e.g., 79% selectivity with 14% C3H8 conversion at 490 C) and well-suppressed overoxidation."
[7] "To date studies have mainly focused on low-temperature activity (8) and probing possible active sites and mechanisms, including surface oxy-functionalization, peculiar kinetic features, and radical chemistry in the gas phase. (9,10)"
[8] "Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation."
[9] "To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides."
[10] "Furthermore, the combination of these soft oxidants in ODHP offers avenues to directly utilize them for chemical conversion to reduce or mitigate acid-gas emissions, thereby adding environment-sustainability-energy benefits to ODHP reactions."
[11] "There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant."
[12] "Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction."
[13] "Also, there has been little covered regarding the development of catalysts for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP."
[14] "In sharp contrast to CO2 and N2O, sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP have not been well studied in the context of active sites, structure, composition, or reaction mechanism, despite these soft oxidants being potential promoters for the reaction."
[15] "Recently, catalytic oxychlorination over metal phosphate (e.g., CrPO4 and FePO4) and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides (e.g., CeO2 and EuOCl) has garnered more interest, as propylene yields up to 55% have been achieved at 500 C."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the thermodynamic limit for conversion efficiency due to endothermic processes, which require high energy input, and rapid catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing an exothermic process that operates efficiently at lower temperatures, reducing the need for high-energy input. However, concerns about the flammability of the process due to the presence of oxygen exist, which might hinder practical implementation.

2. Alternative oxidants such as CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are introduced to replace oxygen in ODHP. These soft oxidants offer environmental benefits by directly converting them for chemical use and reducing or mitigating acid-gas emissions. The focus on CO2 as an oxidant has been extensive, with reviews concentrating on its feasibility in multiple reactions rather than the specifics of the ODHP reaction itself. There is a scarcity of research on catalyst development for ODHP using other soft oxidants, particularly sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP, which have not been well-studied in terms of active sites, structure, composition, or reaction mechanisms. 

3. Recent interest has been directed towards catalytic oxychlorination, where high propylene yields have been achieved using metal phosphates and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides. This highlights the potential of these catalysts in ODHP reactions, demonstrating the ability to oxidize HCl to molecular chlorine.

4. The introduction of soft oxidants in ODHP not only facilitates chemical conversion but also adds environmental sustainability and energy benefits to the process. However, the development of catalysts for these soft oxidant-assisted ODHP processes remains an area of focus for further research.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是由于热力学限制导致的转化效率低下，这需要高能量输入，以及由于焦炭形成导致催化剂快速失效。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供在较低温度下运行的放热过程解决了这些问题，从而减少了对高能量输入的需求。然而，由于存在氧气导致的可燃性问题，这可能妨碍实际应用的实施。

2. 引入CO2、NOx、硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂替代氧气用于ODHP。这些软氧化剂提供了直接利用它们进行化学转化以减少或减轻酸性气体排放的机会，并为ODHP反应带来了环境可持续性和能源效益。对于作为氧化剂的CO2的研究非常广泛，主要集中在其在多个反应中的可行性上，而不是ODHP反应本身的细节。对于使用其他软氧化剂的ODHP催化剂开发研究相对较少，特别是对于硫辅助的DHP和ODHP，这些反应在活性位点、结构、组成或反应机制方面尚未得到充分研究。

3. 最近对催化氧氯化过程的关注表明了金属磷酸盐（如CrPO4和FePO4）和稀土金属氧化物/氧氯化物（如CeO2和EuOCl）的潜力，该过程在500°C时实现了高达55%的丙烯产率。这凸显了这些催化剂在ODHP反应中的能力，证明了它们能够氧化HCl生成分子氯。

4. 在引入软氧化剂以促进ODHP的过程中，不仅促进了化学转化，还为该过程增加了环境可持续性和能源效益。然而，对于软氧化剂辅助ODHP过程的催化剂开发仍然是一个需要进一步研究的重点领域。
