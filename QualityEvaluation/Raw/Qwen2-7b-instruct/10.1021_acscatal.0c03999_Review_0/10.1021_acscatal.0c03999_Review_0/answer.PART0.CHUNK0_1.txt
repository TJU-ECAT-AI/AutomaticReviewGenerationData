[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry."
[2] "However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."
[3] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[4] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."
[5] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."
[6] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."
[7] "Most recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as an outstanding catalyst for O2ODHP with high C3H6 selectivity (e.g., 79% selectivity with 14% C3H8 conversion at 490 C) and well-suppressed overoxidation."
[8] "To date studies have mainly focused on low-temperature activity (8) and probing possible active sites and mechanisms, including surface oxy-functionalization, peculiar kinetic features, and radical chemistry in the gas phase. (9,10)"
[9] "Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation."
[10] "To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides."
[11] "Furthermore, the combination of these soft oxidants in ODHP offers avenues to directly utilize them for chemical conversion to reduce or mitigate acid-gas emissions, thereby adding environment-sustainability-energy benefits to ODHP reactions."
[12] "There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant."
[13] "Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction."
[14] "Also, there has been little covered regarding the development of catalysts for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP."
[15] "In addition, the growing propylene gap between market demand and productivity and the continuously increasing concerns of environmental burden motivate the need for developing alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production."
[16] "All of these factors necessitate a timely analysis and summary of the literature to highlight current progress in catalyst development for alkane conversion utilizing soft oxidants."
[17] "Therefore, the present Review describes state-of-the-art catalysts that have been developed for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants and provides an overview of the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance by extrapolating the reported kinetic and characterization results."
[18] "Major soft oxidants including CO2, N2O, and S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are reviewed."
[19] "Among these, CO2-/NOx-assisted ODHP reactions have been mostly studied, with significant efforts aimed at developing supported metal oxide catalysts including redox-type transition metal oxides (e.g., chromium, vanadium, and iron) (5,1820) and main group metal oxides with nonredox property (e.g., gallium). (5)"
[20] "Catalytic performance has been found to strongly depend on the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support."
[21] "Based on the variation of these aspects, the roles of CO2 and N2O also differ among catalysts."
[22] "In sharp contrast to CO2 and N2O, sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP have not been well studied in the context of active sites, structure, composition, or reaction mechanism, despite these soft oxidants being potential promoters for the reaction."
[23] "Additionally, sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are a common cocontaminant in natural gas."
[24] "Therefore, significant effort is needed to realize the feasibility of this chemistry."
[25] "Recently, catalytic oxychlorination over metal phosphate (e.g., CrPO4 and FePO4) and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides (e.g., CeO2 and EuOCl) has garnered more interest, as propylene yields up to 55% have been achieved at 500 C."
[26] "Oxychlorination chemistry is found to be largely correlated with the ability of catalyst to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the thermodynamic limit for propylene conversion, which demands high-energy input, and rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an exothermic process that operates at lower temperatures, thus avoiding the thermodynamic limitations encountered in traditional methods. While ODHP presents advantages such as reduced energy requirements and potential for high propylene yields, it faces limitations, notably the risk of overoxidation when using oxygen (O2) as an oxidant, which can lead to inefficient reactant usage and low process selectivity. To overcome the flammability concerns associated with O2, alternative soft oxidants like CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides have been explored. These soft oxidants offer opportunities for chemical conversion, reducing or mitigating acid-gas emissions and enhancing sustainability. Despite progress in developing catalysts for ODHP with soft oxidants, there remains a lack of focus on detailed reaction mechanisms and active site studies for certain oxidants, particularly sulfur and halogen compounds. The growing demand for propylene and environmental concerns drive the need for alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production. This review summarizes recent advancements in catalyst development for alkane conversion using soft oxidants, highlighting the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance based on reported kinetic and characterization data.

CO2-, NOx-, and sulfur-assisted ODHP reactions have received significant attention, with efforts focusing on developing supported metal oxide catalysts, including redox-type transition metal oxides and main group metal oxides with non-redox properties. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support. In contrast, studies on sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP are scarce, indicating a need for further investigation into active sites, structure, composition, and reaction mechanisms for these soft oxidants. Sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are common contaminants in natural gas, necessitating significant effort to realize the feasibility of sulfur-assisted ODHP processes. Recent advancements in oxychlorination chemistry, using metal phosphates and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides, have demonstrated promising propylene yields, highlighting the potential of these catalysts for efficient ODHP reactions. The ability of these catalysts to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2 is crucial for the oxychlorination process, which is found to be closely related to the catalyst's capacity for oxidizing HCl.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括丙烯转化的热力学限制，这需要高能量输入，以及由于焦炭形成而迅速催化剂失活。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供在较低温度下运行的放热过程来解决这些问题，从而避免了传统方法遇到的热力学限制。尽管ODHP提供了降低能耗和可能获得高丙烯产量的优势，但它面临着使用氧气（O2）作为氧化剂时的风险，这可能导致反应物效率低下和低工艺选择性。为了克服与O2相关的火焰安全问题，探索了CO2、NOx、硫化物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂。这些软氧化剂为化学转换提供了机会，减少了或减轻了酸性气体排放，并增强了可持续性。尽管已经取得了使用软氧化剂进行烷烃转换的催化剂开发方面的进展，但对某些氧化剂的详细反应机制和活性位点研究仍不足，特别是对于硫化物和卤素化合物。不断增长的丙烯需求和环境担忧推动了使用软氧化剂进行可持续化学生产的替代方法的需求。本综述总结了近年来在软氧化剂辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中催化剂开发的最新进展，根据报道的动力学和表征数据提供了催化剂组成、结构与催化性能之间的关系概述。

CO2、NOx和硫化物辅助的ODHP反应已经收到了大量关注，努力集中在开发包括可逆型过渡金属氧化物和支持型主族金属氧化物在内的支持金属氧化物催化剂上，其中后者具有非可逆性质（例如铁）。这些催化剂的性能受到活性物种分散性和支持物性质的影响。相比之下，对于硫化物辅助的DHP和ODHP的研究较少，表明需要进一步调查这些软氧化剂的活性位点、结构、组成和反应机制。硫化物，如H2S，是天然气中的常见污染物，需要大量努力来实现硫化物辅助ODHP过程的可行性。最近在使用金属磷酸盐和稀土金属氧化物/氧氯化物的氧氯化反应中取得的进展表明，最高可达55%的丙烯产率可以在500°C下获得，这突出了这些催化剂在高效ODHP反应中的潜力。这些催化剂氧化HCl生成分子Cl2的能力对于氧氯化过程至关重要，该过程发现与催化剂氧化HCl的能力密切相关。
