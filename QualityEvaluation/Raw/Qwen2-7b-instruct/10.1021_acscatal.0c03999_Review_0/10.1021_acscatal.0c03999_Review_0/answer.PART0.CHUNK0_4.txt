[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry."
[2] "However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."
[3] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[4] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."
[5] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."
[6] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP."
[7] "Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."
[8] "Most recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as an outstanding catalyst for O2ODHP with high C3H6 selectivity (e.g., 79% selectivity with 14% C3H8 conversion at 490 C) and well-suppressed overoxidation."
[9] "To date studies have mainly focused on low-temperature activity (8) and probing possible active sites and mechanisms, including surface oxy-functionalization, peculiar kinetic features, and radical chemistry in the gas phase. (9,10)"
[10] "Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation."
[11] "To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides."

Answer: 
The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include a supply deficit due to increased market demand, the thermodynamic limit for propane conversion requiring high energy input, and rapid catalyst deactivation caused by coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an exothermic process that avoids thermodynamic constraints at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen (O2) as an oxidant can lead to overoxidation of olefins, reducing the efficiency and selectivity of the process. Recent advancements in catalysts, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), have improved the selectivity of ODHP with O2. Alternative soft oxidants like CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are being explored to overcome the flammability concerns associated with O2 and to further enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the ODHP process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于市场需求快速增长导致的供应不足，以及转化过程的热力学限制需要高能输入和催化剂快速失活。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一个在较低温度下不受热力学约束的放热过程，解决了这些问题。然而，使用氧气（O2）作为氧化剂可能导致烯烃过氧化，降低反应物的利用率和产物选择性。最近在催化剂方面的进展，如六方氮化硼（h-BN），已经提高了使用O2进行ODHP的选择性。正在探索的软氧化剂，如二氧化碳、NOx、硫化合物和卤素/卤化物，旨在克服O2带来的火灾风险，并进一步提高ODHP过程的可持续性和效率。
