[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry."
[2] "However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives."
[3] "At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)."
[4] "Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation."
[5] "Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures."
[6] "Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity."
[7] "To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides."
[8] "There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant."
[9] "Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction."
[10] "Also, there has been little covered regarding the development of catalysts for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the thermodynamic limit imposed by the endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation process, which necessitates high-energy input, and the rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an exothermic reaction pathway that is free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures. However, the use of oxygen (O2) as an oxidant in ODHP leads to inefficiencies and low selectivity due to overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides. To overcome this, alternative soft oxidants such as CO2, NOx, S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are being explored for ODHP. While there have been reviews on CO2-assisted ODHP focusing on its feasibility across multiple reactions, detailed studies on catalyst development for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP remain scarce.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括脱氢过程的热力学限制，这需要高能量输入，以及由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂快速失效。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一个在较低温度下不受热力学约束的放热反应途径，解决了这些问题。然而，使用氧气（O2）作为氧化剂在ODHP中会导致效率低下和低选择性，因为会过氧化烯烃生成二氧化碳。为了克服这个问题，正在探索使用CO2、NOx、含硫化合物和卤素/卤化物等软氧化剂进行ODHP。尽管已经有关于使用CO2辅助ODHP的综述主要关注其在多个反应中的可行性，但对于其他软氧化剂辅助ODHP的催化剂开发的研究仍然很少。
