A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl. (323) Although TeCl4-based catalysts showed promising behavior in the one-step production of allyl chloride from propylene, in-depth understanding on the reaction route is still lacking. Limited knowledge in this field can only be glimpsed from early scattered patents. (327) A novel tandem process was reported by Stauffer for the synthesis of allyl chloride, comprising first the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane (eq 17) over copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K preferably in a shell and tube reactor, and then a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K to produce allyl chloride (eq 18). (328) Therefore, the net reaction (eq 19) of this tandem process is propylene oxychlorination to allyl chloride. The viability of this route should be further evaluated as no convincing reactivity results were disclosed in the patent.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, low selectivity, and coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a potentially more energy-efficient route with higher propylene yields and lower coke formation. ODHP uses propane as a feedstock, which is easier to obtain and handle than the traditional feedstocks like naphtha or natural gas used in steam cracking. The reaction can be conducted at lower temperatures compared to conventional processes, reducing energy requirements. 

Advantages of ODHP include:
1. High propylene yields compared to conventional dehydrogenation routes.
2. Lower coke formation, which improves catalyst lifetime and reduces maintenance costs.
3. Potential for using inexpensive propane as a feedstock.

However, ODHP also faces challenges:
1. Oxidant selection: Oxygen is the most common oxidant used, but it can cause combustion of hydrocarbons and floating coke on the surface of the melt. 
2. Specific challenges with using oxygen: The presence of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, forming undesired carbon oxides, which affects the selectivity and product quality.
3. Catalyst development: The reaction mechanism needs to be better understood, and catalysts that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions while maintaining high activity and selectivity need to be developed.

The tandem process by Stauffer for synthesizing allyl chloride from propylene oxychlorination also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The process combines oxychlorination and dehydrochlorination steps, potentially offering a more efficient way to produce allyl chloride. However, the viability of this route needs further evaluation as there are no convincing reactivity results disclosed in the patent, indicating potential limitations in terms of catalyst performance and process efficiency.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、低选择性和结焦。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一个可能更节能且丙烯产量更高、结焦量更低的途径，解决了这些问题。ODHP使用丙烷作为原料，获取和处理更加容易，与传统的蒸汽裂解使用的原料如石脑油或天然气相比。该反应可以在比传统过程更低的温度下进行，从而降低能量需求。

ODHP的优势包括：
1. 相比于常规脱氢方法，更高的丙烯产率。
2. 更少的结焦形成，这可以延长催化剂寿命并减少维护成本。
3. 使用廉价的丙烷作为原料的潜力。

然而，ODHP也面临一些挑战：
1. 氧化剂的选择：氧气是最常用的氧化剂，但它可能导致烃类燃烧和熔体表面浮动焦炭。
2. 使用氧气的具体挑战：氧气的存在可能导致过氧化，生成不希望的碳氧化物，影响选择性和产品质量。
3. 催化剂开发：需要更好地理解反应机制，并开发能够承受苛刻反应条件、同时保持高活性和选择性的催化剂。

Stauffer提出的将丙烯氧氯化合成异丙醇的串联工艺也有其优势和限制。该过程结合了氧氯化和去氯化步骤，可能提供了一种更有效的方法来生产异丙醇。然而，由于专利中没有揭示出令人信服的活性结果，因此可能存在关于催化剂性能和工艺效率的潜在局限性。
