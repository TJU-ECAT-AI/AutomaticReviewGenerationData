[1] "Propane oxychlorination, though rarely targeted, has been disclosed in a few patents."
[2] "An early study on copper chloride-based catalysts showed a spectrum of chloro-derivatives (tri/tetra-chloroethylenes and tetrachloride) being the products."
[3] "Thus, selectivity control presents a formidable challenge for this reaction."
[4] "Recently, Schweizer et al. showed that propene and allyl chloride can be selectively produced by porous LaOCl-catalyzed oxychlorination of propane with low combustion."
[5] "The high selectivity of C3H6 and C3H5Cl suggested that dehydrochlorination of both C3H7Cl and C3H6Cl2 occurred following sequential Cl-substitution of C3H8."
[6] "Interestingly, propane oxybromination over vanadium phosphate gave prominent C2H5Br instead of C3H7Br in the low-temperature region, and the propylene selectivity increased rapidly at the compensation of C2H5Br with increasing temperature."
[7] "This agrees well with another study by Testova et al., who found the predominating products shifted from chloropropanes to dehydrochlorination products in propane chlorination when the temperature was increased from 573 to 676 K."
[8] "The catalyst plays a pivotal role in the oxychlorination of propylene."
[9] "The bond strength of MCl (M corresponds to metal in the catalysts) has been proposed as the descriptor for this reaction."
[10] "For the metal chlorides with high binding energies, such as FeCl3 and CoCl2, the reactivity was low and i-propyl chloride was the main product."
[11] "CuCl2 with moderate bond strength shows higher activity with the major product of 1,2-dichloropropane."
[12] "Noble metal chlorides like PdCl2 and TeCl4 with lower binding energies are the most active and selective catalysts for producing allyl chloride."
[13] "Miyake and Hanaya speculated that the interaction between the metal chloride and propylene might be the key to distinguish the addition reaction from the substitution reaction."
[14] "They assumed that there was a strong affinity for π-electrons on the double bond of propylene for Cu, whereas a π-allyl type interaction prevailed for Pd and Te."
[15] "The reaction mechanism of propylene oxychlorination over PdCl2 catalysts was proposed by Fujimoto et al., (317, 326) in which π-allylic intermediate was formed by the interaction between Pd0 and propylene (eq 15)."
[16] "With chloride substitution from PdCl2, allyl chloride was released while Pd2+ cations were reduced back to Pd0 (eq 16)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the endothermic nature of the reactions, the equilibrium-limited extent of dehydrogenation, and the inefficiency of direct chlorination methods, which often result in low yields and high energy consumption. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more exothermic reaction pathway, which reduces energy consumption and allows for higher conversion rates. ODHP uses oxygen as the oxidant, providing a more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternative to traditional methods. The selectivity of propene production is improved in ODHP, as it shifts the reaction towards the desired products by controlling the reaction conditions and catalyst properties. This is exemplified by the use of porous LaOCl catalysts, which can selectively produce propene and allyl chloride through oxychlorination, bypassing the formation of undesirable chlorinated derivatives.

The challenges associated with ODHP specifically include the optimization of oxidant selection, which in this case is oxygen, to achieve the desired selectivity towards propene. Oxygen is essential for the generation of iodine radicals to trigger the chain reactions, but an excess of oxygen can cause combustion of the desirable dehydrogenation products. Balancing the amount of oxygen to achieve optimal selectivity is a critical consideration. Additionally, the presence of water with the molten salts in the process is extremely corrosive, which is an intrinsic disadvantage. Another limitation is the formation of carbon oxides due to the inevitable combustion of hydrocarbons and floating coke on the surface of the melt, which can affect the purity of the final products.

In summary, ODHP offers advantages in terms of energy efficiency, selectivity, and environmental impact compared to traditional methods. However, it requires careful control of reaction parameters and catalyst design to overcome challenges related to oxidant selection, corrosion, and combustion byproducts.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括反应的吸热性质、脱氢反应的平衡限制以及直接氯化方法的效率低下，导致能量消耗高和产量低。氧化脱氢法（ODHP）通过提供一个更放热的反应途径解决了这些问题，减少了能量消耗并允许更高的转化率。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂提供了更环保和经济的替代方案，同时提高了丙烯的选择性。通过控制反应条件和催化剂性质，实现了向目标产物的偏好选择，例如使用多孔LaOCl催化剂通过氧氯化可以选择性地产生丙烯和环氧乙烷，从而绕过了形成不希望的氯化衍生物的过程。

ODHP面临的特定挑战包括对氧化剂选择的优化，即氧气，以实现丙烯的选择性。氧气对于生成碘自由基以触发链反应是必要的，但过量的氧气会导致所期望的脱氢产物燃烧。平衡氧气的量以实现最佳丙烯选择性是一个关键考虑因素。此外，水与熔融盐系统中的存在极其腐蚀性，这是内在的不利因素。另一个限制是由于不可避免地燃烧烃类和熔融表面的焦油形成的碳氧化物的形成，这会影响最终产品的纯度。

综上所述，ODHP在能量效率、选择性和环境影响方面相对于传统方法提供了优势。然而，需要仔细控制反应参数和催化剂设计来克服与氧化剂选择、腐蚀和副产品相关的挑战。
