A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl. (323) Although TeCl4-based catalysts showed promising behavior in the one-step production of allyl chloride from propylene, in-depth understanding on the reaction route is still lacking. Limited knowledge in this field can only be glimpsed from early scattered patents. (327) A novel tandem process was reported by Stauffer for the synthesis of allyl chloride, comprising first the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane (eq 17) over copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K preferably in a shell and tube reactor, and then a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K to produce allyl chloride (eq 18). (328) Therefore, the net reaction (eq 19) of this tandem process is propylene oxychlorination to allyl chloride. The viability of this route should be further evaluated as no convincing reactivity results were disclosed in the patent.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, low selectivity towards the desired product, and the formation of undesirable byproducts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane into propylene through a series of reactions that are more exothermic and selective. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP allows for higher propylene yields compared to conventional methods. However, the selection of oxidant is critical, as excessive oxygen can lead to combustion of the desired products, posing safety concerns.

In the context of ODHP, the use of oxygen introduces challenges such as the need for precise control over the oxygen content to prevent combustion and ensure the desired product distribution. The redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl involved in the ethylene oxychlorination process can be analogously applied to ODHP, potentially enhancing propylene production. However, the detailed reaction mechanism for propylene oxychlorination over CuCl2 catalysts remains uncertain, and further research is needed to optimize the process. The tandem process proposed by Stauffer involves the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene followed by a vapor-phase reaction with propylene to produce allyl chloride, demonstrating the potential of ODHP in propylene synthesis. However, the practical viability of this process requires more conclusive reactivity results and safety evaluations.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括吸热反应、目标产物选择性低以及生成副产品的风险。通过氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，因为它将丙烷转化为丙烯的过程更加放热且选择性更高。使用氧气作为氧化剂在ODHP中允许更高的丙烯产率，相比传统方法具有优势。然而，在选择氧化剂时存在挑战，过多的氧气可能导致所需产品的燃烧，从而引发安全问题。

在ODHP的背景下，氧气的使用引入了控制氧气含量以防止燃烧并确保目标产物分布的精确控制需求。乙烷氧氯化过程中的CuCl2和CuCl的还原氧化循环可以类比应用于ODHP，可能增强丙烯的生产。然而，关于在CuCl2催化剂上进行丙烯氧氯化的详细反应机制仍不确定，需要进一步研究来优化工艺。斯塔弗提出的串联过程涉及氯化四氯乙烯然后与丙烯进行气相反应来制备异丙醇，这展示了ODHP在丙烯合成中的潜力。然而，此过程的实践可行性需要更多的结论性活性结果和安全性评估。
