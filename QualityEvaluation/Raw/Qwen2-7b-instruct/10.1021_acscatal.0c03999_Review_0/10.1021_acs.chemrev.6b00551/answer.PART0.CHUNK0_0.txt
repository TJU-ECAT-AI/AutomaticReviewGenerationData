<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages in propylene production. It is a potentially more energy-efficient process compared to traditional methods, such as steam reforming of naphtha. Additionally, ODHP does not require the use of hydrogen, which is a significant advantage as hydrogen is often expensive and requires additional purification and transportation steps.</p>
<p>However, ODHP faces challenges in selecting the appropriate oxidant. Oxygen is commonly used due to its high reactivity and abundance, but it can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts like carbon dioxide and water. Alternative oxidants, such as air or other gases, may offer a more sustainable solution but require further research to optimize their use in the process.</p>
<p>The main challenge associated with using oxygen is the formation of carbon dioxide, which can lead to corrosion in the process equipment. This necessitates the development of corrosion-resistant materials and the implementation of proper process control measures to mitigate this issue.</p>

ODHP addresses the primary challenges in current propylene production methods by offering a potentially more energy-efficient process without the need for hydrogen. However, selecting the appropriate oxidant, particularly oxygen, presents challenges due to the formation of unwanted byproducts like carbon dioxide. This byproduct can lead to corrosion in the process equipment, requiring the development of corrosion-resistant materials and proper process control measures.
