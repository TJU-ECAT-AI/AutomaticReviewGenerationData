[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents an attractive alternative to current propylene production methods, particularly in addressing the environmental concerns associated with traditional processes."
[2] "ODHP has the potential to significantly reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional methods."
[3] "However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant is a critical challenge in ODHP, as the choice of oxidant can greatly affect the efficiency and safety of the process."
[4] "Oxygen is commonly used as the oxidant in ODHP, but its use presents challenges due to the risk of explosion and the need for careful control of the oxygen concentration."
[5] "Alternative oxidants, such as nitrogen dioxide, have been explored to mitigate these risks, but they come with their own complexities and limitations."
[6] "Another challenge in ODHP is the formation of byproducts, such as acetylene, which can complicate the separation and purification of propylene."
[7] "Efforts to optimize the reaction conditions, catalysts, and process parameters are ongoing to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of ODHP."
