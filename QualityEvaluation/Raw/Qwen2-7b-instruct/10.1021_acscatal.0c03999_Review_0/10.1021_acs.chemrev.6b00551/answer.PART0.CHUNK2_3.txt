Among the challenges with the activation of these long-chain molecules lie in achieving a high selectivity of the targeted product while maintaining reasonable conversion rates. Several organic intermediates can be prepared by these reactions. For instance, 1,1,4,4-tetrabromobutadiene was produced by the oxidative bromination of butane with oxygen and bromine in the presence of CuBr2KBr/γ-Al2O3 (90% selectivity at 523 K). 1,4-Dichlorobutadiene, a useful solvent and an intermediate for dyestuffs, can also be selectively synthesized by direct oxychlorination of straight chain C4 hydrocarbons (butane, butene, and/or butadiene) over CuCl2KCl/γ-Al2O3 (X = 4165%, S = 5792%, at 563593 K). There are several studies dealing with the catalyzed oxychlorination of butadiene to dichlorobutenes. 

A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl. (323) Although TeCl4-based catalysts showed promising behavior in the one-step production of allyl chloride from propylene, in-depth understanding on the reaction route is still lacking. Limited knowledge in this field can only be glimpsed from early scattered patents. (327)

A novel tandem process was reported by Stauffer for the synthesis of allyl chloride, comprising first the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane (eq 17) over copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K preferably in a shell and tube reactor, and then a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K to produce allyl chloride (eq 18). (328) Therefore, the net reaction (eq 19) of this tandem process is propylene oxychlorination to allyl chloride.

The corrosion and recovery of halogens require sophisticated process and reactor engineering. The reaction heat is particularly prominent in the oxyhalogenation reactions. Strategies for the fixed-bed technologies including catalyst grading or staging of feed in reactor cascades offer better temperature control. In addition, a fluidized-bed reactor generally has good heat removal capacity and thus can ease the hot spot effect.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards particular olefins, and the depletion of fossil resources. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly route for propylene production. Unlike conventional methods, ODHP utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and easier to obtain than crude oil. Moreover, it allows for selective production of propylene without the need for further upgrading, simplifying the process.

One of the key advantages of ODHP is its ability to operate at lower temperatures compared to conventional methods, reducing energy consumption. Additionally, it can be integrated with other processes, such as oxychlorination or oxybromination, for the production of other valuable chemicals and fuels, enhancing the economic viability of the entire system.

Regarding oxidant selection, oxygen is typically used as the oxidant in ODHP, but challenges arise from its flammability and the potential for combustion of hydrocarbons, which can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of oxygen requires careful management of the reaction conditions to prevent overheating and ensure safe operation. The presence of water in the system can exacerbate these issues, as it can cause corrosion and increase the risk of hot spots in the reactor.

The limitations of ODHP include the need for high-quality catalysts capable of performing the dehydrogenation reaction efficiently, as well as the requirement for advanced process and reactor engineering to manage heat and corrosion effectively. In-depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and catalyst properties is essential for optimizing the process and addressing the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as the oxidant.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、特定烯烃选择性低以及化石资源的减少。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，提供一种可能更节能和环境友好的丙烯生产途径。与传统方法不同，ODHP使用丙烷作为原料，这既丰富又易于获取，比原油更易于获得。此外，它允许选择性地生产丙烯，无需进一步升级，简化了过程。

ODHP的一个关键优势是其与常规方法相比可以在较低温度下运行，从而降低能耗。此外，它可以与其他过程集成以生产其他有价值的化学品和燃料，提高整个系统经济性的可能性。

在氧化剂选择方面，通常使用氧气作为氧化剂，在ODHP中，氧气的可燃性和潜在的烃类燃烧问题带来了挑战。使用氧气需要仔细管理反应条件，以防止过热并确保安全操作。系统中的水分会加剧这些问题，因为它会导致腐蚀并增加反应器热点的风险。

ODHP的局限性包括需要高效催化剂来有效执行脱氢反应，以及为了有效地管理和腐蚀，需要高级别的过程和反应器工程。深入理解反应机制和催化剂性质对于优化过程并解决使用氧气作为氧化剂的特定挑战至关重要。
