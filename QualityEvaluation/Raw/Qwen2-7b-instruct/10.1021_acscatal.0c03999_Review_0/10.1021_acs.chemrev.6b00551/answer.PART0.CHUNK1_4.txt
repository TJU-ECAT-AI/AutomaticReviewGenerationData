[1] "The Dow Chemicals Company envisioned a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to VCM at low temperatures (T < 700 K), enabled by the discovery of novel catalytically active materials, LaOCl/LaCl3 (Figure 18b)."

[2] "However, chlorine can be directly introduced in the oxychlorination reactor in this newly developed process, thus the chlorination step is omitted."

[3] "It was reported that a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1 can be achieved under conditions that simulated a complete recycle of the reaction byproducts in a pilot plant."

[4] "Both cold flow and hot flow tests in pilot plant reactor system indicate poor gassolid contacting for some catalysts."

[5] "Fluidization engineering, with regard to the reactor design and catalyst preparation, still presents a big technical hurdle to the commercial scale implementation of this process."

The Dow Chemicals Company developed a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to VCM at low temperatures, utilizing the LaOCl/LaCl3 catalyst. This process omits the chlorination step by directly introducing chlorine in the oxychlorination reactor. Under simulated complete recycling conditions in a pilot plant, a high VCM yield of 7981% and productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1 were achieved. However, poor gas-solid contacting was observed in both cold flow and hot flow tests in pilot plant reactor systems, posing a significant technical challenge for commercial scale implementation.

杜邦化学公司开发了一种新的流化床反应器技术，用于在较低温度下（T < 700 K）直接将乙烷转化为VCM，利用LaOCl/LaCl3催化剂。此过程通过在氧氯化反应器中直接引入氯气跳过了氯化步骤。在模拟完全回收条件下，在中试装置中实现了高达7981%的VCM产率和0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1的生产力。然而，在中试装置的冷流和热流测试中观察到了气体-固体接触不良的问题，这构成了商业规模实施过程中的一大技术障碍。

[2] "Phosgene chemistry, albeit somewhat arbitrary in classification, encompasses phosgenation reactions of two main categories: those that introduce the building block carbonyl as a structural unit, and those involving phosgene and its derivatives as reagents."

[3] "Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and TDI are the key precursors in the manufacture of PU which account for 61% and 34%, respectively, in the world isocyanate market."

[4] "Considering the huge and ever-increasing global demand of these polymers (Figure 5), development of effective technologies for chlorine recycling will make the processes more sustainable."

Phosgene chemistry, despite its high toxicity, has been widely utilized in the production of fine chemicals since the inception of the chemical industry due to its exceptional chemical properties. It falls under two main categories: reactions that incorporate the carbonyl building block as a structural unit, and those using phosgene and its derivatives as reagents. Methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) are pivotal in the manufacturing of polyurethanes (PU), constituting 61% and 34% respectively of the global isocyanate market. As the global demand for these polymers increases, the development of efficient chlorine recycling technologies will enhance the sustainability of these processes.

尽管其高度毒性，磷酰氯化学自化学工业初期就广泛应用于精细化学品生产，因其显著的化学性质而被广泛应用。它主要分为两类：引入羰基作为结构单元的反应，以及使用磷酰氯及其衍生物作为试剂的反应。二苯基甲烷二异氰酸酯(MDI)和甲苯二异氰酸酯(TDI)在聚氨酯(PU)制造中至关重要，分别占全球异氰酸酯市场61%和34%。鉴于这些聚合物需求量的巨大且持续增长（见图5），开发有效的氯回收技术将使这些过程更加可持续。

[1] "Over the years, significant efforts regarding both catalyst formulation and reactor configuration were made to improve the original Deacon-Hurter process."

[2] "The catalyst formulation was modified through additives, such as didymium and/or potassium chlorides, which form molten salts and improve the catalyst stability."

[3] "Nevertheless, industrial technologies developed in the second half of the 20th century for chlorine production via HCl oxidation in fluidized-bed reactors, such as the Shell-Chlor process established in the 1960s (CuCl2-KCl/SiO2 catalyst, 638 K, 30 kton Cl2 per annum facility) (211, 212) and the MTChlor process established in the late 1980s (Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, 653 K, 60 kton Cl2 per annum facility), (213, 214) were progressively abandoned."

多年来，人们致力于改进催化剂配方和反应器配置以优化原始Deacon-Hurter工艺。添加了诸如镧系元素和/或钾盐等添加剂，形成了熔融盐，从而提高了催化剂的稳定性。尽管如此，20世纪下半叶开发的用于在流化床反应器中通过HCl氧化生产氯气的工业技术，如1960年代建立的壳牌氯化工艺（使用CuCl2-KCl/SiO2催化剂，638 K，每年30千吨氯气产能）和1980年代末期建立的MT氯化工艺（采用Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，653 K，每年60千吨氯气产能），最终被逐步淘汰。

[1] "Recently, RuO2 supported on TiO2 rutile is commercialized by Sumitomo, (208) and that on SnO2 cassiterite developed by BMS, (220, 221) is ready for large-scale application."

[2] "The key reason for the success of the latter formulations was shown to be the structural matching between the active phase and support, and thus both the rutile and cassiterite carriers enable the epitaxial growth of RuO2 on the surface."

[3] "Despite the strong active phase-support interaction in RuO2/rutile or RuO2/cassiterite systems, RuO2 is prone to sintering in a long-term use."

[4] "Therefore, the incorporation of a nanosized oxide to the catalyst formulation was found as a suitable strategy to ensure the long-term durability."

Recently, Sumitomo commercialized RuO2 supported on rutile TiO2, while BMS developed SnO2 cassiterite with RuO2 that is ready for large-scale application. The success of these formulations lies in the structural compatibility between the active phase and support, allowing epitaxial growth of RuO2 on the surface. However, RuO2 tends to sinter over extended periods, necessitating the integration of a nanosized oxide into the catalyst formulation as a strategy to maintain durability.

最近，Sumitomo推出了在锐钛矿TiO2上支持的RuO2，而BMS开发了在锡石SnO2上的RuO2，这两种都已准备好进行大规模应用。这些配方的成功在于活性相与载体之间的结构匹配，允许RuO2在表面形成外延生长。然而，RuO2在长期使用中容易发生聚集，因此需要将纳米级氧化物融入催化剂配方中作为确保耐久性的合适策略。
