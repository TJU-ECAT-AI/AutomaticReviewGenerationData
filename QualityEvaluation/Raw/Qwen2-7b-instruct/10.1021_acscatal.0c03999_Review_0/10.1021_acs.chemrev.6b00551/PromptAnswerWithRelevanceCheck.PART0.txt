1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, endothermic reactions, and potential environmental concerns related to the use of toxic molecular halogens. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more sustainable pathway for propylene production. It consumes less energy, operates at lower temperatures, and avoids the use of toxic halogenated compounds. The use of oxygen as an oxidant presents challenges related to the selection of the right oxidant concentration to balance the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, while avoiding overoxidation to carbon oxides. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include controlling the reaction temperature, managing the reaction heat, and preventing unwanted side reactions. 

2. The primary factors influencing the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in the conversion of methyl halides to hydrocarbons are topology and acidity. Zeolites with different pore sizes and structures, such as large pore zeolites (Y and Beta) and medium pore zeolites (ZSM-5), exhibit different performance characteristics. Large pore zeolites allow for greater conversion rates but suffer from severe carbon deposition due to the large cages or channels. Medium pore zeolites like ZSM-5 demonstrate high conversion rates and reduced coke formation, making them more suitable for this reaction. The acidity of the zeolite, which can be tuned by varying the Si/Al ratio, affects the selectivity towards light olefins. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to a decrease in acidity and an increase in olefin selectivity.

3. The impact of feed impurities, specifically higher halogenated methane (H:C  2), on the coupling reaction of methyl halides over SAPO-34 zeolites involves the formation of aromatics and rapid catalyst deactivation. Isotopic-labeling experiments suggest that CH2Cl2 can be incorporated into methylbenzene reaction intermediates and form the gas phase products via the hydrocarbon pool mechanism. This indicates that separation of (oxy)halogenation products is necessary to prevent detrimental effects on the zeolite-based upgrading route.

4. Key differences in the reaction mechanism proposed for the coupling of methyl halides over zeolites compared to the conversion of methanol relate to the presence of different functional groups and leaving groups. Cleaving a CX (X = Cl or Br) bond is thermodynamically more favorable than in the case of COH, reflecting the higher stability of the leaving group. However, the reactivity of methyl halide coupling differs from methanol due to the lower proton affinity of the methyl halide molecules, leading to a lower coverage of active sites. The chemistry involved between transformations of methanol and methyl halides is ambiguous, pointing to different reaction mechanisms and potential challenges in catalyst, reactor, and process design.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、热力学反应和潜在的环境问题，如使用有毒分子卤素。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更可持续的路径来解决这些问题，提供了更低的能量消耗、较低的操作温度以及避免使用有毒卤化物的方法。氧气作为氧化剂带来的挑战包括选择合适的氧化剂浓度以平衡反应动力学和热力学，同时避免过氧化导致碳氧化物生成。使用氧气的具体挑战包括控制反应温度、管理反应热以及防止不必要的副反应。

2. 影响甲基卤化物转化为烃类的沸石催化剂性能的主要因素是拓扑结构和酸性。具有不同孔径和结构的沸石，如大孔沸石（Y和Beta）和中等孔径沸石（ZSM-5），表现出不同的性能特性。大孔沸石允许更高的转化率，但因孔腔或通道较大而导致严重的碳沉积。中等孔径沸石如ZSM-5表现出较高的转化率和较少的焦炭形成，因此更适合此反应。沸石的酸性可以通过调整Si/Al比来调节，影响轻烯烃的选择性。更高的Si/Al比率导致酸性降低并增加烯烃选择性。

3. 高级卤代甲烷（H:C  2）作为杂质对甲基卤化物在SAPO-34沸石上的耦合反应的影响涉及芳香化合物的形成和催化剂的快速失活。同位素标记实验表明，CH2Cl2可以被整合到甲苯反应中间体中，并通过烃池机制形成气相产物。这表明分离（氧）卤化物产品是必要的，以防止对基于沸石的升级路线产生不利影响。

4. 甲基卤化物耦合与甲醇转换相比的关键差异在于存在的不同功能团和离去基团。断裂CX（X = Cl或Br）键比断裂COH键更有利于热力学，反映了离去基团的更高稳定性。然而，由于甲基卤化物分子的较低质子亲和力导致活性位点覆盖度较低，使得甲基卤化物耦合的反应性与甲醇不同。甲基卤化物与甲醇之间的化学反应存在不确定性，指出不同的反应机理和催化剂、反应器和工艺设计方面的挑战。

The Dow process utilizes a fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) at low temperatures, enabled by novel catalytically active materials, LaOCl/LaCl3. This process is similar to the ethylene vinyl chloride (EVC) route in that it employs a fluidized-bed reactor for the oxychlorination section and an additional hydrogenation step for the recycling of chlorinated byproducts. Notably, chlorine can be directly introduced into the oxychlorination reactor in this newly developed process, eliminating the chlorination step. The process is also suitable for the cofeeding of ethane and ethylene, which can be recycled with hydrochloric acid.

A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl. (323) Although TeCl4-based catalysts showed promising behavior in the one-step production of allyl chloride from propylene, in-depth understanding on the reaction route is still lacking. Limited knowledge in this field can only be glimpsed from early scattered patents. (327) A novel tandem process was reported by Stauffer for the synthesis of allyl chloride, comprising first the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane (eq 17) over copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K preferably in a shell and tube reactor, and then a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K to produce allyl chloride (eq 18). (328) Therefore, the net reaction (eq 19) of this tandem process is propylene oxychlorination to allyl chloride. The viability of this route should be further evaluated as no convincing reactivity results were disclosed in the patent.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include endothermic reactions, low selectivity towards the desired product, and the formation of undesirable byproducts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane into propylene through a series of reactions that are more exothermic and selective. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP allows for higher propylene yields compared to conventional methods. However, the selection of oxidant is critical, as excessive oxygen can lead to combustion of the desired products, posing safety concerns.

In the context of ODHP, the use of oxygen introduces challenges such as the need for precise control over the oxygen content to prevent combustion and ensure the desired product distribution. The redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl involved in the ethylene oxychlorination process can be analogously applied to ODHP, potentially enhancing propylene production. However, the detailed reaction mechanism for propylene oxychlorination over CuCl2 catalysts remains uncertain, and further research is needed to optimize the process. The tandem process proposed by Stauffer involves the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene followed by a vapor-phase reaction with propylene to produce allyl chloride, demonstrating the potential of ODHP in propylene synthesis. However, the practical viability of this process requires more conclusive reactivity results and safety evaluations.

The reaction mechanism over fullerenes (C60) as a model system has been studied using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The presence of bent carbon layers, semispheres, and carbon cages in activated carbon and fullerenes has similar characteristics, influencing the reaction mechanism. The utilization of carbon materials in catalysts improves their performance by enhancing the adsorption of reactants. The reaction can be described by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) model based on kinetic studies over commercial catalysts. In the past decade, there has been a focus on developing novel catalysts capable of overcoming the issues related to chlorine recycling in polyurethane (PU) and polycarbonate (PC) manufacturing, especially concerning the limited selling options and high costs associated with neutralizing HCl. Ruthenium (Ru) oxide-based catalysts exhibit high activity at low temperatures and preserve the bulk structure, with chlorination occurring primarily on the surface layers.

A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl. (323) Although TeCl4-based catalysts showed promising behavior in the one-step production of allyl chloride from propylene, in-depth understanding on the reaction route is still lacking. Limited knowledge in this field can only be glimpsed from early scattered patents. (327) A novel tandem process was reported by Stauffer for the synthesis of allyl chloride, comprising first the oxychlorination of perchloroethylene to hexachloroethane (eq 17) over copper chloride-based catalysts at 473648 K preferably in a shell and tube reactor, and then a vapor-phase reaction with propylene at 673973 K to produce allyl chloride (eq 18). (328) Therefore, the net reaction (eq 19) of this tandem process is propylene oxychlorination to allyl chloride. The viability of this route should be further evaluated as no convincing reactivity results were disclosed in the patent.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, low selectivity, and coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a potentially more energy-efficient route with higher propylene yields and lower coke formation. ODHP uses propane as a feedstock, which is easier to obtain and handle than the traditional feedstocks like naphtha or natural gas used in steam cracking. The reaction can be conducted at lower temperatures compared to conventional processes, reducing energy requirements. 

Advantages of ODHP include:
1. High propylene yields compared to conventional dehydrogenation routes.
2. Lower coke formation, which improves catalyst lifetime and reduces maintenance costs.
3. Potential for using inexpensive propane as a feedstock.

However, ODHP also faces challenges:
1. Oxidant selection: Oxygen is the most common oxidant used, but it can cause combustion of hydrocarbons and floating coke on the surface of the melt. 
2. Specific challenges with using oxygen: The presence of oxygen can lead to overoxidation, forming undesired carbon oxides, which affects the selectivity and product quality.
3. Catalyst development: The reaction mechanism needs to be better understood, and catalysts that can withstand the harsh reaction conditions while maintaining high activity and selectivity need to be developed.

The tandem process by Stauffer for synthesizing allyl chloride from propylene oxychlorination also presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The process combines oxychlorination and dehydrochlorination steps, potentially offering a more efficient way to produce allyl chloride. However, the viability of this route needs further evaluation as there are no convincing reactivity results disclosed in the patent, indicating potential limitations in terms of catalyst performance and process efficiency.

Among the challenges with the activation of these long-chain molecules lie in achieving a high selectivity of the targeted product while maintaining reasonable conversion rates. Several organic intermediates can be prepared by these reactions. For instance, 1,1,4,4-tetrabromobutadiene was produced by the oxidative bromination of butane with oxygen and bromine in the presence of CuBr2KBr/γ-Al2O3 (90% selectivity at 523 K). 1,4-Dichlorobutadiene, a useful solvent and an intermediate for dyestuffs, can also be selectively synthesized by direct oxychlorination of straight chain C4 hydrocarbons (butane, butene, and/or butadiene) over CuCl2KCl/γ-Al2O3 (X = 4165%, S = 5792%, at 563593 K). There are several studies dealing with the catalyzed oxychlorination of butadiene to dichlorobutenes. 

A radical reaction mechanism similar to that in ethylene oxychlorination was proposed for Cu-based catalysts, involving the redox cycle between CuCl2 and CuCl. (323) Although TeCl4-based catalysts showed promising behavior in the one-step production of allyl chloride from propylene, in-depth understanding on the reaction route is still lacking.

(328) Therefore, the net reaction (eq 19) of this tandem process is propylene oxychlorination to allyl chloride.

The corrosion and recovery of halogens require sophisticated process and reactor engineering. The reaction heat is particularly prominent in the oxyhalogenation reactions. Strategies for the fixed-bed technologies including catalyst grading or staging of feed in reactor cascades offer better temperature control. In addition, a fluidized-bed reactor generally has good heat removal capacity and thus can ease the hot spot effect.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, include high energy consumption, low selectivity towards particular olefins, and the depletion of fossil resources. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly route for propylene production. Unlike conventional methods, ODHP utilizes propane as a feedstock, which is abundant and easier to obtain than crude oil. Moreover, it allows for selective production of propylene without the need for further upgrading, simplifying the process.

One of the key advantages of ODHP is its ability to operate at lower temperatures compared to conventional methods, reducing energy consumption. Additionally, it can be integrated with other processes, such as oxychlorination or oxybromination, for the production of other valuable chemicals and fuels, enhancing the economic viability of the entire system.

Regarding oxidant selection, oxygen is typically used as the oxidant in ODHP, but challenges arise from its flammability and the potential for combustion of hydrocarbons, which can lead to the formation of carbon oxides. The use of oxygen requires careful management of the reaction conditions to prevent overheating and ensure safe operation. The presence of water in the system can exacerbate these issues, as it can cause corrosion and increase the risk of hot spots in the reactor.

The limitations of ODHP include the need for high-quality catalysts capable of performing the dehydrogenation reaction efficiently, as well as the requirement for advanced process and reactor engineering to manage heat and corrosion effectively. In-depth understanding of the reaction mechanisms and catalyst properties is essential for optimizing the process and addressing the specific challenges associated with using oxygen as the oxidant.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、特定烯烃选择性低以及化石资源的减少。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，提供一种可能更节能和环境友好的丙烯生产途径。与传统方法不同，ODHP使用丙烷作为原料，这既丰富又易于获取，比原油更易于获得。此外，它允许选择性地生产丙烯，无需进一步升级，简化了过程。

ODHP的一个关键优势是其与常规方法相比可以在较低温度下运行，从而降低能耗。此外，它可以与其他过程集成以生产其他有价值的化学品和燃料，提高整个系统经济性的可能性。

在氧化剂选择方面，通常使用氧气作为氧化剂，在ODHP中，氧气的可燃性和潜在的烃类燃烧问题带来了挑战。使用氧气需要仔细管理反应条件，以防止过热并确保安全操作。系统中的水分会加剧这些问题，因为它会导致腐蚀并增加反应器热点的风险。

ODHP的局限性包括需要高效催化剂来有效执行脱氢反应，以及为了有效地管理和腐蚀，需要高级别的过程和反应器工程。深入理解反应机制和催化剂性质对于优化过程并解决使用氧气作为氧化剂的特定挑战至关重要。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the endothermic nature of the reactions, the equilibrium-limited extent of dehydrogenation, and the inefficiency of direct chlorination methods, which often result in low yields and high energy consumption. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more exothermic reaction pathway, which reduces energy consumption and allows for higher conversion rates. ODHP uses oxygen as the oxidant, providing a more environmentally friendly and economically viable alternative to traditional methods. The selectivity of propene production is improved in ODHP, as it shifts the reaction towards the desired products by controlling the reaction conditions and catalyst properties. This is exemplified by the use of porous LaOCl catalysts, which can selectively produce propene and allyl chloride through oxychlorination, bypassing the formation of undesirable chlorinated derivatives.

The challenges associated with ODHP specifically include the optimization of oxidant selection, which in this case is oxygen, to achieve the desired selectivity towards propene. Oxygen is essential for the generation of iodine radicals to trigger the chain reactions, but an excess of oxygen can cause combustion of the desirable dehydrogenation products. Balancing the amount of oxygen to achieve optimal selectivity is a critical consideration. Additionally, the presence of water with the molten salts in the process is extremely corrosive, which is an intrinsic disadvantage. Another limitation is the formation of carbon oxides due to the inevitable combustion of hydrocarbons and floating coke on the surface of the melt, which can affect the purity of the final products.

In summary, ODHP offers advantages in terms of energy efficiency, selectivity, and environmental impact compared to traditional methods. However, it requires careful control of reaction parameters and catalyst design to overcome challenges related to oxidant selection, corrosion, and combustion byproducts.

ODHP面临的特定挑战包括对氧化剂选择的优化，即氧气，以实现丙烯的选择性。氧气对于生成碘自由基以触发链反应是必要的，但过量的氧气会导致所期望的脱氢产物燃烧。平衡氧气的量以实现最佳丙烯选择性是一个关键考虑因素。此外，水与熔融盐系统中的存在极其腐蚀性，这是内在的不利因素。另一个限制是由于不可避免地燃烧烃类和熔融表面的焦油形成的碳氧化物的形成，这会影响最终产品的纯度。

综上所述，ODHP在能量效率、选择性和环境影响方面相对于传统方法提供了优势。然而，需要仔细控制反应参数和催化剂设计来克服与氧化剂选择、腐蚀和副产品相关的挑战。

[34] "The formation of VCM was noteworthy over this system."
[35] "The origin of VCM formation on ceria was understood by different experiments."
[36] "The bifunctional character of ceria enables it to integrate both oxychlorination catalyzed by redox sites and dehydrochlorination led by acid sites on a single surface, thereby leading to intensified VCM production."
[37] "The highly exothermic ethylene oxychlorination reaction is carried out in staged multitubular fixed-bed or fluidized-bed reactors over promoted copper chloride catalysts, MCuClx/γ-Al2O3 (M = alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, and rare earth metal), at 493573 K and 214 bar."
