The Dow Chemicals Company developed a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to vinyl acetate monomer (VCM) at low temperatures, utilizing novel catalytically active materials such as LaOCl/LaCl3. This process eliminates the chlorination step, allowing for the cofeeding of ethane and ethylene, which can be recycled with HCl. It has achieved a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 grams of VCM per hour per gram of catalyst under conditions simulating a complete recycle of reaction byproducts in a pilot plant. However, pilot plant reactor system tests indicate poor gas-solid contacting for some catalysts, presenting a technical hurdle for commercial scale implementation. BASF also developed a process using ethane as a raw material for the production of ethylene dichloride (EDC), followed by EDC cracking to VCM.

杜邦化学公司开发了一种新的流化床反应器技术，可以在低温下（T < 700 K）直接将乙烷转化为醋酸乙烯酯单体（VCM），利用新型催化活性材料如LaOCl/LaCl3。该过程省去了氯化步骤，允许乙烷和乙烯的共喂料，这些物质可以与HCl回收。在模拟完全回收反应副产品的条件下，在中试装置上实现了7981%的VCM产率和每克催化剂每小时0.0500.055克VCM的生产效率。然而，中试反应器系统的测试显示一些催化剂存在气固接触不良的问题，这构成了商业规模实施的技术障碍。巴斯夫也开发了一种使用乙烷作为原料生产二氯乙烷（EDC），然后通过EDC裂解来制备VCM的过程。
