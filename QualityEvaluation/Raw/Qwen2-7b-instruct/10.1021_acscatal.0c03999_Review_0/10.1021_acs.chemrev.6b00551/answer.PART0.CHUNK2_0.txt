[1] "The development of more selective and stable catalysts, suitable reactors with effective heat and corrosion management, and integrated processes are crucial challenges to be addressed."
[2] "Topology impact of various protonic zeolites on the methyl chloride coupling reaction have been studied by different groups, regardless of the potential influence of different acidity arising from the coordination and Si/Al ratio."
[3] "While large pore zeolites (Y and Beta) showed appreciable conversions, carbonaceous deposits were severe due to the relatively large cages or channels of zeolites."
[4] "SAPO-34 surpassed ZSM-22 with a higher activity and total selectivity to light olefins but was more prone to coking under equivalent conditions."
[5] "The presence of methane (oxy)halogenation products produces appreciable amounts of overhalogenated byproducts, especially the dihalogenated compounds."
[6] "Theoretical, the addition of higher halogenated methane (H:C  2) will lead to an increasing propensity for the formation of aromatics."
[7] "In the case of bromination, the presence of CH2Cl2 promoted the formation of aromatics and caused rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, endothermic reactions, and potential environmental concerns related to the use of toxic molecular halogens. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more sustainable pathway for propylene production. It consumes less energy, operates at lower temperatures, and avoids the use of toxic halogenated compounds. The use of oxygen as an oxidant presents challenges related to the selection of the right oxidant concentration to balance the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, while avoiding overoxidation to carbon oxides. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include controlling the reaction temperature, managing the reaction heat, and preventing unwanted side reactions. 

2. The primary factors influencing the catalytic performance of zeolite catalysts in the conversion of methyl halides to hydrocarbons are topology and acidity. Zeolites with different pore sizes and structures, such as large pore zeolites (Y and Beta) and medium pore zeolites (ZSM-5), exhibit different performance characteristics. Large pore zeolites allow for greater conversion rates but suffer from severe carbon deposition due to the large cages or channels. Medium pore zeolites like ZSM-5 demonstrate high conversion rates and reduced coke formation, making them more suitable for this reaction. The acidity of the zeolite, which can be tuned by varying the Si/Al ratio, affects the selectivity towards light olefins. Higher Si/Al ratios lead to a decrease in acidity and an increase in olefin selectivity.

3. The impact of feed impurities, specifically higher halogenated methane (H:C  2), on the coupling reaction of methyl halides over SAPO-34 zeolites involves the formation of aromatics and rapid catalyst deactivation. Isotopic-labeling experiments suggest that CH2Cl2 can be incorporated into methylbenzene reaction intermediates and form the gas phase products via the hydrocarbon pool mechanism. This indicates that separation of (oxy)halogenation products is necessary to prevent detrimental effects on the zeolite-based upgrading route.

4. Key differences in the reaction mechanism proposed for the coupling of methyl halides over zeolites compared to the conversion of methanol relate to the presence of different functional groups and leaving groups. Cleaving a CX (X = Cl or Br) bond is thermodynamically more favorable than in the case of COH, reflecting the higher stability of the leaving group. However, the reactivity of methyl halide coupling differs from methanol due to the lower proton affinity of the methyl halide molecules, leading to a lower coverage of active sites. The chemistry involved between transformations of methanol and methyl halides is ambiguous, pointing to different reaction mechanisms and potential challenges in catalyst, reactor, and process design.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、热力学反应和潜在的环境问题，如使用有毒分子卤素。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更可持续的路径来解决这些问题，提供了更低的能量消耗、较低的操作温度以及避免使用有毒卤化物的方法。氧气作为氧化剂带来的挑战包括选择合适的氧化剂浓度以平衡反应动力学和热力学，同时避免过氧化导致碳氧化物生成。使用氧气的具体挑战包括控制反应温度、管理反应热以及防止不必要的副反应。

2. 影响甲基卤化物转化为烃类的沸石催化剂性能的主要因素是拓扑结构和酸性。具有不同孔径和结构的沸石，如大孔沸石（Y和Beta）和中等孔径沸石（ZSM-5），表现出不同的性能特性。大孔沸石允许更高的转化率，但因孔腔或通道较大而导致严重的碳沉积。中等孔径沸石如ZSM-5表现出较高的转化率和较少的焦炭形成，因此更适合此反应。沸石的酸性可以通过调整Si/Al比来调节，影响轻烯烃的选择性。更高的Si/Al比率导致酸性降低并增加烯烃选择性。

3. 高级卤代甲烷（H:C  2）作为杂质对甲基卤化物在SAPO-34沸石上的耦合反应的影响涉及芳香化合物的形成和催化剂的快速失活。同位素标记实验表明，CH2Cl2可以被整合到甲苯反应中间体中，并通过烃池机制形成气相产物。这表明分离（氧）卤化物产品是必要的，以防止对基于沸石的升级路线产生不利影响。

4. 甲基卤化物耦合与甲醇转换相比的关键差异在于存在的不同功能团和离去基团。断裂CX（X = Cl或Br）键比断裂COH键更有利于热力学，反映了离去基团的更高稳定性。然而，由于甲基卤化物分子的较低质子亲和力导致活性位点覆盖度较低，使得甲基卤化物耦合的反应性与甲醇不同。甲基卤化物与甲醇之间的化学反应存在不确定性，指出不同的反应机理和催化剂、反应器和工艺设计方面的挑战。
