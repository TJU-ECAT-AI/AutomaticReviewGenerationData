Halogen-mediated conversion of hydrocarbons to commodities is a critical process in the industrial production of various valuable chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers. This process involves the reaction of halogens or halides with hydrocarbons, leading to intermediate compounds that are readily converted to valuable commodities. The transformation is predominantly mediated by heterogeneous catalysts, and has long been successfully applied in the production of polymers. The review covers the fundamental understanding and applied relevance of halogen chemistry in polymer industries (polyvinyl chloride, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates) and in the activation of light hydrocarbons. The reactions of particular interest include halogenation and oxyhalogenation of alkanes and alkenes, dehydrogenation of alkanes, conversion of alkyl halides, and oxidation of hydrogen halides, with emphasis on the catalyst, reactor, and process design. Perspectives on the challenges and directions for future development in this exciting field are provided.
