Answer: Halogen chemistry is crucial for the production of various chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and polymers, particularly through reactions with hydrocarbons to create valuable commodities. Catalysts play a significant role in these processes, which have been successfully applied in polymer production for a long time. The recent discovery of ample natural gas reserves has renewed interest in halogen-mediated processes as the most economical method for converting natural gas to liquids. This review delves into the core understanding and practical applications of halogen chemistry in industries producing polyvinyl chloride, polyurethanes, and polycarbonates, as well as in the activation of light hydrocarbons. Specific focus areas include halogenation and oxyhalogenation of alkanes and alkenes, dehydrogenation of alkanes, conversion of alkyl halides, and the oxidation of hydrogen halides, with an emphasis on catalyst, reactor, and process design.
