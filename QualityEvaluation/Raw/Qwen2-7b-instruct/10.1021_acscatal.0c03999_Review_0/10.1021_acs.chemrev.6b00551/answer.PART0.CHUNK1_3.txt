[1] "The Dow Chemicals Company envisioned a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to VCM at low temperatures (T < 700 K), enabled by the discovery of novel catalytically active materials, LaOCl/LaCl3 (Figure 18b)."
[2] "It essentially merges ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene, whether by means of thermal cracking or catalytic dehydrogenation, with ethylene oxychlorination to produce EDC by the known copper chloride-based catalysts."
[3] "Despite the high toxicity, it has been widely used in the production of fine chemicals since the beginning of the chemical industry due to the remarkable chemical properties."
[4] "Phosgene is synthesized on an industrial scale with an annual global production of several million tons by a catalyzed reaction between gaseous chlorine and CO at elevated temperature (323423 K)."
[5] "Besides, PVC business also serves to recycle HCl released from other commercial processes."
[6] "The key features of RuO2-based catalysts are (i) high activity at low temperatures (Figure 21a) and (ii) preservation of bulk structure (i.e., chlorination is confined to the surface layers) (Figure 21b)."
[7] "The role of Al2O3 binder on the carrier stabilization. Comparative studies on RuO2/SnO2 and RuO2/SnO2-Al2O3 demonstrated a stable Cl2 production in a pilot reactor for 7000 h on the latter, whereas the former rapidly deactivated."
[8] "It was found that pure ZrO2 is nearly inactive, while 30% Ce content leads to the same activity as the pure CeO2 sample."
[9] "The basic difference between them is the geology of their reservoirs and therefore require different extraction techniques to acquire the commercial quantities (Figure 25)."
[10] "The low-temperature activation of a highly symmetric methane molecule is thermodynamically favorable with molecular halogens such as chlorine and bromine."

1. Dow Chemicals Company has developed a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for converting ethane to VCM at low temperatures using LaOCl/LaCl3 as a catalyst.
2. The process combines ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene and ethylene oxychlorination to produce ethylene dichloride (EDC) using copper chloride-based catalysts.
3. Phosgene, or carbonic acid dichloride, has been widely used in fine chemical production due to its remarkable chemical properties.
4. Phosgene is synthesized on an industrial scale through a catalyzed reaction between gaseous chlorine and carbon monoxide at elevated temperatures.
5. PVC production can recycle HCl released from other industrial processes.
6. RuO2-based catalysts are characterized by high activity at low temperatures and preservation of bulk structure, confining chlorination to the surface layers.
7. The Al2O3 binder plays a crucial role in carrier stabilization, enhancing the durability of RuO2/SnO2-Al2O3 catalysts in HCl oxidation compared to RuO2/SnO2.
8. Mixed ceria-zirconia systems show enhanced stability in HBr oxidation with a higher Ce:Zr molar fraction leading to improved activity.
