[1] "However, both cold flow and hot flow tests in pilot plant reactor system indicate poor gassolid contacting for some catalysts."
[2] "It was reported that a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1 can be achieved under conditions that simulated a complete recycle of the reaction byproducts in a pilot plant."

The Dow process utilizes a fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) at low temperatures, enabled by novel catalytically active materials, LaOCl/LaCl3. This process is similar to the ethylene vinyl chloride (EVC) route in that it employs a fluidized-bed reactor for the oxychlorination section and an additional hydrogenation step for the recycling of chlorinated byproducts. Notably, chlorine can be directly introduced into the oxychlorination reactor in this newly developed process, eliminating the chlorination step. The process is also suitable for the cofeeding of ethane and ethylene, which can be recycled with hydrochloric acid. Under simulated conditions for complete recycling of the reaction byproducts in a pilot plant, a VCM yield of 7981% and a productivity of 0.0500.055 g(VCM) h1 gcat1 were reported.

道尔公司使用流化床反应器技术直接将乙烷转化为低温度下的乙烯基氯化物单体（VCM），通过新型催化活性材料LaOCl/LaCl3实现。这一过程与乙二醇乙烯基氯化物（EVC）路线类似，都在流化床反应器中进行氧氯化步骤，并且有一个额外的氢化步骤用于回收氯化副产品。值得注意的是，在这个新开发的过程中，可以直接向氧氯化反应器引入氯气，从而省去了氯化步骤。该过程还适用于乙烷和乙烯的共喂料，这些可以与盐酸一起循环利用。在模拟条件下，在小型试验装置中完全回收反应副产物，报告的VCM产率为7981%，每克催化剂每小时可生产0.0500.055克(VCM)。

[1] "However, demand for other plastics manufactured via chlorine chemistry, particularly PU and PC, grows at a higher pace than that of PVC, leading to a growing excess of HCl byproduct in the chemical industry."
[2] "The key hurdles with these systems are (i) low single pass HCl conversion, (ii) loss of activity due to the volatilization of the active phase, (iii) environmental concerns associated with the use of a chromium-based material, and (iv) corrosion issues related to the presence of unreacted HCl and product H2O."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The increasing demand for plastics produced via chlorine chemistry, notably polyurethane (PU) and polycarbonate (PC), surpasses that for polyvinyl chloride (PVC), causing an escalating surplus of hydrochloric acid (HCl) byproduct in the chemical industry. The main obstacles for current systems include (i) a low single-pass conversion of HCl, (ii) loss of activity due to the evaporation of the active component, (iii) environmental issues stemming from the usage of chromium-based materials, and (iv) corrosion problems related to unreacted HCl and product water.

[1] "The key features of RuO2-based catalysts are (i) high activity at low temperatures (Figure 21a) and (ii) preservation of bulk structure (i.e., chlorination is confined to the surface layers) (Figure 21b)."
[2] "Sumitomo used silica, (208) whereas, Bayer opted for alumina which also served as a binding agent for the shaping of millimeter-sized bodies."

The distinguishing characteristics of ruthenium oxide (RuO2)-based catalysts are (i) their high activity at low temperatures, as depicted in Figure 21a, and (ii) the maintenance of the overall structure (meaning that chlorination is restricted to the surface layers), as illustrated in Figure 21b. Sumitomo utilized silica in their catalyst formulation, whereas Bayer chose alumina, which also acted as a binding agent for molding objects measuring several millimeters.
