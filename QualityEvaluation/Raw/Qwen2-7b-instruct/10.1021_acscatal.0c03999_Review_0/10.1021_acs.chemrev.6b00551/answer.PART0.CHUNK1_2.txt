[1] "The Dow Chemicals Company envisioned a new fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to VCM at low temperatures (T < 700 K), enabled by the discovery of novel catalytically active materials, LaOCl/LaCl3 (Figure 18b)."

[2] "However, both cold flow and hot flow tests in pilot plant reactor system indicate poor gassolid contacting for some catalysts. Fluidization engineering, with regard to the reactor design and catalyst preparation, still presents a big technical hurdle to the commercial scale implementation of this process."

[3] "Another process has been conceived by BASF, using ethane as a raw material for the production of EDC, followed by EDC cracking to VCM (Figure 18c)."

[4] "Despite the high toxicity, it has been widely used in the production of fine chemicals since the beginning of the chemical industry due to the remarkable chemical properties."

[5] "Phosgene is synthesized on an industrial scale with an annual global production of several million tons by a catalyzed reaction between gaseous chlorine and CO at elevated temperature (323423 K)."

[6] "On the basis of similar characteristics of the ample presence of bent carbon layers, semispheres, and carbon cages in activated carbon and fullerene (C60), Lercher et al. conducted a combined experimental and theoretical study on the reaction mechanism over C60 as a model system."

[7] "It seems that the utilization of carbon materials promotes the adsorption of both reactants on the catalyst surface and thus enhances the performance."

[8] "This is supported by the early kinetic studies on phosgene formation over commercial catalysts, which indicated that the reaction can be described by a LH model."

[9] "Still, the limited selling option and high cost for neutralizing HCl triggered the industrial and academic research in the past decade to hunt for novel catalysts capable of overcoming the above issues, particularly in relation to chlorine recycling in PU and PC manufactures."

[10] "The key features of RuO2-based catalysts are (i) high activity at low temperatures (Figure 21a) and (ii) preservation of bulk structure (i.e., chlorination is confined to the surface layers) (Figure 21b)."

The Dow Chemicals Company has envisioned a fluidized-bed reactor technology for the direct conversion of ethane to vinyl acetate monomer (VCM) at low temperatures (<700 K), utilizing novel catalytically active materials such as LaOCl/LaCl3. However, the pilot plant reactor system tests showed poor gas-solid contacting for some catalysts, indicating a significant technical challenge for commercial scale implementation. BASF has also developed a process using ethane as a raw material for the production of ethylene dichloride (EDC), followed by cracking to VCM. Phosgene, a highly toxic substance, has been widely used in the production of fine chemicals due to its remarkable chemical properties. It is synthesized industrially on a large scale through a catalyzed reaction between gaseous chlorine and CO at elevated temperatures. Carbon materials enhance the performance of phosgene synthesis by promoting the adsorption of both reactants on the catalyst surface. The reaction mechanism over fullerenes (C60) as a model system has been studied using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The presence of bent carbon layers, semispheres, and carbon cages in activated carbon and fullerenes has similar characteristics, influencing the reaction mechanism. The utilization of carbon materials in catalysts improves their performance by enhancing the adsorption of reactants. The reaction can be described by a Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) model based on kinetic studies over commercial catalysts. In the past decade, there has been a focus on developing novel catalysts capable of overcoming the issues related to chlorine recycling in polyurethane (PU) and polycarbonate (PC) manufacturing, especially concerning the limited selling options and high costs associated with neutralizing HCl. Ruthenium (Ru) oxide-based catalysts exhibit high activity at low temperatures and preserve the bulk structure, with chlorination occurring primarily on the surface layers. These catalysts play a crucial role in the industrial process of chlorine recycling.

道化学公司已展望了一种流化床反应器技术，用于在低温（<700 K）下直接将乙烷转化为乙烯醋酸酯单体（VCM），利用新型催化活性材料如LaOCl/LaCl3。然而，在试点工厂反应系统测试中显示了一些催化剂的气固接触不良，这表明在商业规模实施过程中存在重大技术挑战。巴斯夫还开发了一个使用乙烷作为原材料生产乙二醇二氯化物（EDC），然后裂解为VCM的过程。磷光气体由于其显著的化学性质，在化学工业初期就被广泛用于生产精细化学品。它通过催化反应在高温度下合成工业上大量生产，该反应涉及气体氯和二氧化碳。碳材料通过促进两种反应物在催化剂表面的吸附来提高磷光气体合成的性能。在全碳（C60）作为模型系统的实验和理论研究中对反应机制进行了联合研究。在全碳中发现的弯曲碳层、半球形结构和碳笼具有与活性炭和富勒烯相似的特征，影响反应机制。利用碳材料在催化剂中的应用提高了它们的性能，通过增强反应物的吸附。反应可以由Langmuir-Hinshelwood（LH）模型描述，基于对商用催化剂的动态研究。在过去十年中，重点是开发能够克服聚氨酯（PU）和聚碳酸酯（PC）制造过程中与HCl回收相关的各种问题的新催化剂，特别是考虑到HCl中和选项有限和高成本的问题。钌（Ru）氧化物基催化剂在低温下表现出高活性，并保持了整体结构，其中氯化主要发生在表面层。这些催化剂在工业氯回收过程中发挥着关键作用。
