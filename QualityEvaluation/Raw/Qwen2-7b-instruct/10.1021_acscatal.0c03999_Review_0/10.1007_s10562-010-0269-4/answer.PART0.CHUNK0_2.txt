<p>As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene. However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Despite the advantages of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), selecting appropriate oxidants poses challenges due to safety concerns, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact. The use of oxygen specifically presents challenges related to its reactivity, which can lead to unwanted side reactions and product selectivity issues.</p>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods relate to energy efficiency and environmental impact. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient process, especially in terms of product yield and catalyst longevity. However, the selection of oxidants, particularly oxygen, introduces challenges due to its reactive nature and potential for adverse side reactions. These challenges include safety concerns, cost-effectiveness, and environmental considerations associated with the use of oxygen in the process.
