[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention."
[2] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene."
[3] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene."
[4] "However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
[5] "Consequently, it is important to develop a catalyst exhibiting high activity, high stability, and high selectivity for the industrialization of propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "So far, the most researches were mainly on the chromium and platinum based catalysts which loaded on the different supporters."
[7] "As the chromium posed great danger to the environment, the platinum supported catalysts are mainly studied."
[8] "Recently, Pt/ZSM-5 applied as a catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation has been extended investigated as a result of its specific framework structure and the low aluminum content."
[9] "In order to further the study, PtSnK/ZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of potassium were prepared for propane dehydrogenation in this paper."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as conventional crackers, are their inability to meet the growing demand for propylene and their inefficiency due to high temperatures that favor thermal cracking reactions, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient way to produce propylene through a controlled endothermic process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen. The document highlights the importance of developing catalysts that exhibit high activity, stability, and selectivity for industrialization. Research efforts have focused on chromium and platinum-based catalysts, with platinum-supported catalysts being preferred due to environmental concerns. The specific framework structure and low aluminum content of ZSM-5 zeolites have made them attractive for use in propane dehydrogenation studies. To further investigate the effects of potassium addition on catalyst performance, PtSnK/ZSM-5 catalysts with varying potassium contents were prepared and characterized.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是，传统裂解器无法满足丙烯需求的增长，并且由于高温有利于热裂化反应，导致产品收率降低和催化剂活性下降。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过控制放热过程解决了这些问题，提供了一种更有效的丙烯生产方式。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和使用氧气时存在优势和限制。文献强调了开发具有高活性、稳定性和选择性的催化剂以实现工业化的重要性。研究重点集中在铬和铂基催化剂上，由于环境问题，铂基催化剂受到青睐。ZSM-5沸石的独特框架结构和较低的铝含量使其成为丙烷脱氢研究的有吸引力的候选材料。为了进一步研究钾添加对催化剂性能的影响，制备了不同钾含量的PtSnK/ZSM-5催化剂，并进行了表征。

[6] "Suitable amount of K can not only decrease the acid sites on the surface, but also improve the interaction of the metallic Pt, Sn and the supporter, leading to the best matching of metallic function and acid function of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, which will improve the activity of the catalysts and prevent the coke formation of the catalysts."

Propylene production typically relies on conventional cracking processes, which are inadequate to meet the growing demand for propylene. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the dehydrogenation of propane, a method used for propylene production, requires high temperatures that favor the formation of coke and lighter alkanes, leading to a decline in product yield and catalyst deactivation. The addition of potassium (K) to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst system optimally modifies the catalyst's properties, resulting in a significant increase in propylene selectivity and yield. The best performance is achieved when the K content reaches 0.8%. This optimized K addition enhances the interaction between metals, supports, and acidic sites, achieving an optimal balance that boosts catalyst activity and prevents catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

丙烯生产通常依赖传统的裂解工艺，无法满足丙烯需求的增长。这种问题加剧了，因为丙烷脱氢法用于生产丙烯需要较高的温度，这有利于焦炭和轻烷烃的形成，导致产品收率下降和催化剂失活。在PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂系统中添加钾（K）可以优化催化剂的性质，显著提高丙烯的选择性和产率。最佳性能出现在K含量达到0.8%时。这种优化的K添加增强了金属、支持体和酸性位点之间的相互作用，实现了活性的最佳平衡，防止了由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。

Propylene production faces challenges due to the inability of traditional cracking methods to meet growing propylene demand. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering advantages such as producing propylene from a readily available feedstock. However, ODHP presents challenges in selecting the right oxidant and managing specific reactions that favor coke formation, affecting product yield and catalyst stability. To tackle these issues, researchers investigate catalyst modifications to achieve high activity, stability, and selectivity for industrial propane dehydrogenation. Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts, known for their specific structure and low aluminum content, have received attention for their potential in propane dehydrogenation. Adding promoters like Sn, Na, La, and Mg aims to enhance catalyst properties. The addition of potassium has been shown to improve catalytic performance, but detailed data on its impact on PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts is lacking.
