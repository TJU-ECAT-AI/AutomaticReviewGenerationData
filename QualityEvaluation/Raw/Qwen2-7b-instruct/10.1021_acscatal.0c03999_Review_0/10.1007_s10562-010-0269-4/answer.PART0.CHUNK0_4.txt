<p>Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such as in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene.</p>
<p>As a result, the new technologies of dehydrogenation of propane for propylene have been developed.</p>
<p>Among these methods, dehydrogenation of propane has gained more and more focus as a result of its special advantages.</p>
<p>However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is important to develop a catalyst exhibiting high activity, high stability, and high selectivity for the industrialization of propane dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>Recently, Pt/ZSM-5 applied as a catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation has been extended investigated as a result of its specific framework structure and the low aluminum content.</p>
<p>In order to further the study, PtSnK/ZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of potassium were prepared for propane dehydrogenation in this paper.</p>
<p>Technologies including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, metal dispersion, NH3-TPD, TPR, and TPO were used to study the catalysts characterization.</p>
<p>The results indicated that the addition of K had an obvious impact on the catalytic performance of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst.</p>
<p>A suitable amount of K could not only change the acid of the catalysts but also improve the relation between metals and the support, thus reduce the deactivation rate and increase the selectivity to propylene.</p>
<p>It was found that the propylene selectivity and yield could reach the maximum when the content of K was 0.8%.</p>

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the conventional crackers' inability to meet the growing demand for propylene, leading to the development of new technologies for the dehydrogenation of propane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane offers several advantages over traditional methods, but it also presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection and the specific difficulties associated with utilizing oxygen. The addition of potassium to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst system was found to significantly impact the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation, improving activity, stability, and selectivity. The optimal amount of potassium was determined to be 0.8%, achieving the highest propylene selectivity and yield.
