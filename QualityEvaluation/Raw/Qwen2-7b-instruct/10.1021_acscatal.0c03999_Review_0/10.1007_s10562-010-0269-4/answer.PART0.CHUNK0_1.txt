[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention."
[2] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene."
[3] "As the propane dehydrogenation reaction is an endothermic process, it requires relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propylene."
[4] "However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
[5] "It was found that the propylene selectivity and yield could reach the maximum when the content of K was 0.8%."
[6] "Suitable amount of K can not only decrease the acid sites on the surface, but also improve the interaction of the metallic Pt, Sn and the supporter, leading to the best matching of metallic function and acid function of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, which will improve the activity of the catalysts and prevent the coke formation of the catalysts."

Propylene production typically relies on conventional cracking processes, which are inadequate to meet the growing demand for propylene. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that the dehydrogenation of propane, a method used for propylene production, requires high temperatures that favor the formation of coke and lighter alkanes, leading to a decline in product yield and catalyst deactivation. The addition of potassium (K) to the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst system optimally modifies the catalyst's properties, resulting in a significant increase in propylene selectivity and yield. The best performance is achieved when the K content reaches 0.8%. This optimized K addition enhances the interaction between metals, supports, and acidic sites, achieving an optimal balance that boosts catalyst activity and prevents catalyst deactivation due to coke formation.

丙烯生产通常依赖传统的裂解工艺，无法满足丙烯需求的增长。这种问题加剧了，因为丙烷脱氢法用于生产丙烯需要较高的温度，这有利于焦炭和轻烷烃的形成，导致产品收率下降和催化剂失活。在PtSn/ZSM-5催化剂系统中添加钾（K）可以优化催化剂的性质，显著提高丙烯的选择性和产率。最佳性能出现在K含量达到0.8%时。这种优化的K添加增强了金属、支持体和酸性位点之间的相互作用，实现了活性的最佳平衡，防止了由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。
