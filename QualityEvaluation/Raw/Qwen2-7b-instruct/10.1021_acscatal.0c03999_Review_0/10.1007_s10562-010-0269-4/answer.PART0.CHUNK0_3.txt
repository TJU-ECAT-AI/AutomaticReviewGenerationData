[1] "Due to its important role in a myriad of chemical applications such in the production of polypropylene, cumene, etc., the propylene has gained more and more attention."
[2] "Nevertheless, these conventional crackers are failing to meet the need of the increasing demands of the propylene."
[3] "As a result, the new technologies of dehydrogenation of propane for propylene have been developed."
[4] "Among these methods, dehydrogenation of propane has gained more and more focus as a result of its special advantages."
[5] "However, the high reaction temperature favors thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes which lead to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Consequently, it is important to develop a catalyst exhibiting high activity, high stability, and high selectivity for the industrialization of propane dehydrogenation."
[7] "Recently, Pt/ZSM-5 applied as a catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation has been extended investigated as a result of its specific framework structure and the low aluminum content."
[8] "Then, the modification of the Pt/ZSM-5 deserved more and more attention from both theoretical and practical points of view."
[9] "In our previous study, many studies were carried out on the Pt/ZSM-5."
[10] "Promoters such as Sn, Na, La, and Mg have been already added."
[11] "Its believed that Sn reduces coke formation by suppressing side reactions thus increasing catalyst stability, increases the dispersion of Pt by its geometrical effect thus increasing the catalyst activity."
[12] "The addition of Na, La, and Mg can neutralize the strong acid sites on the surface of the catalysts and improve the relationships among the metals and the supporters."
[13] "Although the addition of K on the PtSn/Al2O3 was proved to improve the catalytic properties greatly, no detail data about the K added to the PtSn/ZSM-5 was supplied by the papers so far."

Propylene production faces challenges due to the inability of traditional cracking methods to meet growing propylene demand. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering advantages such as producing propylene from a readily available feedstock. However, ODHP presents challenges in selecting the right oxidant and managing specific reactions that favor coke formation, affecting product yield and catalyst stability. To tackle these issues, researchers investigate catalyst modifications to achieve high activity, stability, and selectivity for industrial propane dehydrogenation. Pt/ZSM-5 catalysts, known for their specific structure and low aluminum content, have received attention for their potential in propane dehydrogenation. Adding promoters like Sn, Na, La, and Mg aims to enhance catalyst properties. The addition of potassium has been shown to improve catalytic performance, but detailed data on its impact on PtSn/ZSM-5 catalysts is lacking.
