The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as conventional crackers, are their inability to meet the growing demand for propylene and their inefficiency due to high temperatures that favor thermal cracking reactions, leading to a decrease in product yield and an increase in catalyst deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient way to produce propylene through a controlled endothermic process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen. The document highlights the importance of developing catalysts that exhibit high activity, stability, and selectivity for industrialization. Research efforts have focused on chromium and platinum-based catalysts, with platinum-supported catalysts being preferred due to environmental concerns. The specific framework structure and low aluminum content of ZSM-5 zeolites have made them attractive for use in propane dehydrogenation studies. To further investigate the effects of potassium addition on catalyst performance, PtSnK/ZSM-5 catalysts with varying potassium contents were prepared and characterized.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是，传统裂解器无法满足丙烯需求的增长，并且由于高温有利于热裂化反应，导致产品收率降低和催化剂活性下降。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过控制放热过程解决了这些问题，提供了一种更有效的丙烯生产方式。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和使用氧气时存在优势和限制。文献强调了开发具有高活性、稳定性和选择性的催化剂以实现工业化的重要性。研究重点集中在铬和铂基催化剂上，由于环境问题，铂基催化剂受到青睐。ZSM-5沸石的独特框架结构和较低的铝含量使其成为丙烷脱氢研究的有吸引力的候选材料。为了进一步研究钾添加对催化剂性能的影响，制备了不同钾含量的PtSnK/ZSM-5催化剂，并进行了表征。
