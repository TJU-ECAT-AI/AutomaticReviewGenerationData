[1] "Many authors have studied the effect of tin in the formation and composition of the coke by temperature- programmed oxidation (TPO) (5, 713)."
[2] "In this paper we present two different studies of deac- tivated Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 dehydrogenation cata- lysts, where the coke has been deposited using different re- action conditions."
[3] "The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%."
[4] "The addition of tin to a platinum catalyst has proved to be an effective way to reduce undesired reactions and prevent deactivation, due to coke formation in naphtha reforming andalkanedehydrogenationreactions(15)."
[5] "We suggest the following explanation for the ethane and ethene formation results. Ethene is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier."

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the formation of coke, which leads to deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen.
2. The amount of coke formed during the dehydrogenation process varies depending on the reaction conditions, reaching up to 8 wt%.
3. Adding tin to a platinum catalyst effectively reduces undesired reactions and prevents deactivation due to coke formation in processes like naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation.
4. Ethene is primarily formed through cracking on the carrier material during the dehydrogenation process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是焦炭的形成，导致催化剂失活。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，潜在地减少焦炭的形成。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和使用氧气的具体挑战方面存在自身的优点和限制。
2. 在脱氢过程中形成的焦炭量根据反应条件而变化，最高可达8 wt%。
3. 向铂催化剂中添加锡有效地减少了诸如石脑油重整和烷烃脱氢等过程中的不希望的反应和由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活。
4. 乙烯主要通过在载体材料上的裂解过程形成。
