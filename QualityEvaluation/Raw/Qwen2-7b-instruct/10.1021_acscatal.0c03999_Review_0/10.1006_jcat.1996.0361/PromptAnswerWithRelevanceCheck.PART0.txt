[1] "Many authors have studied the effect of tin in the formation and composition of the coke by temperature- programmed oxidation (TPO) (5, 713)."
[2] "In this paper we present two different studies of deac- tivated Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 dehydrogenation cata- lysts, where the coke has been deposited using different re- action conditions."
[3] "The amount of coke on the catalyst varied from about 1 to 8 wt%."
[4] "The addition of tin to a platinum catalyst has proved to be an effective way to reduce undesired reactions and prevent deactivation, due to coke formation in naphtha reforming andalkanedehydrogenationreactions(15)."
[5] "We suggest the following explanation for the ethane and ethene formation results. Ethene is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier."

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the formation of coke, which leads to deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing coke formation. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen.
2. The amount of coke formed during the dehydrogenation process varies depending on the reaction conditions, reaching up to 8 wt%.
3. Adding tin to a platinum catalyst effectively reduces undesired reactions and prevents deactivation due to coke formation in processes like naphtha reforming and alkane dehydrogenation.
4. Ethene is primarily formed through cracking on the carrier material during the dehydrogenation process.

[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
[6] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."
[7] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."
</quotes>

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the inefficiency and high energy consumption. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient and energy-saving alternative, especially in terms of reducing the need for large-scale heat input required in traditional processes. ODHP also presents advantages such as the potential for lower capital costs and the ability to utilize renewable energy sources. However, it faces limitations in the selection of oxidants, particularly with the use of oxygen, which requires careful consideration of safety and environmental impacts. Additionally, the specific challenges associated with using oxygen include managing high reaction temperatures and pressures, as well as the risk of forming unwanted byproducts.

2. The formation of coke during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process leads to catalyst deactivation, posing a significant challenge. Three types of coke are identified in the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles: coke on and near the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The coke formation is not directly responsible for the deactivation but occurs in parallel with it. The coke on the carrier is formed through a distinct mechanism that is independent of the main reaction's deactivation.

3. Hydrogen plays a crucial role in mitigating the effects of coke formation during ODHP. It can reduce the deactivation rate and the formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing the formation of coke precursors. However, hydrogen cannot effectively remove the coke that has already been formed on the catalyst. This finding contrasts with previous studies that demonstrated the ability of hydrogen to remove a substantial portion of coke formed on a platinum catalyst through treatment at elevated temperatures.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括效率低下和高能耗。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供可能更高效、节能的替代方案来解决这些问题，尤其是在减少传统过程中所需的大规模热输入方面。ODHP还具有潜在的低资本成本优势，并且能够利用可再生能源。然而，在选择氧化剂时，特别是使用氧气时，需要仔细考虑安全性和环境影响。此外，使用氧气的具体挑战包括管理高反应温度和压力，以及形成不需要的副产品的风险。

2. 在氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）过程中形成的焦炭导致催化剂失活，这是主要的挑战之一。在温度程序氧化（TPO）图谱中检测到了三种类型的焦炭：靠近金属的焦炭、载体上的焦炭和载体上的石墨状焦炭。观察到的焦炭不是直接导致失活的原因，而是与主要反应的失活同时发生。载体上的焦炭是通过独立于主要反应失活机制形成的。

3. 氢气在减轻ODHP过程中焦炭形成的影响中起着关键作用。它可以通过抑制焦炭前体的形成来降低失活速率和主要部分焦炭的形成。然而，氢气不能有效地去除已经在催化剂上形成的焦炭。这一发现与之前的研究结果形成对比，后者证明了氢气能够在高温下通过处理去除铂催化剂上大量形成的焦炭的能力。

[1] "The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene."
[2] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[3] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[4] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."
[5] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

1. The formation of coke on the first two peaks in the TPO profiles is influenced by temperature and propene partial pressure, while hydrogen reduces this formation.
2. The third type of coke on the carrier is not formed through the same route as the first two peaks.
3. The first peak of coke reaches a steady state after approximately 15 hours, whereas the second peak continues to increase.
