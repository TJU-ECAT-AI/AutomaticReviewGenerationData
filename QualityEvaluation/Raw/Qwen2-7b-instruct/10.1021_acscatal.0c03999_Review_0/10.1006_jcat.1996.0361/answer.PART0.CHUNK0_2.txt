[1] "The formation of the coke belonging to the first two peaks in the TPO profiles increases with temperature and partial pressure of propene."
[2] "Hydrogen, on the other hand, suppresses the formation."
[3] "The amount of coke that can be attributed to the third peak increases with temperature and propane partial pressure."
[4] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased."
[5] "Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The formation of coke on the first two peaks in the TPO profiles is influenced by temperature and propene partial pressure, while hydrogen reduces this formation.
2. The third type of coke on the carrier is not formed through the same route as the first two peaks.
3. The first peak of coke reaches a steady state after approximately 15 hours, whereas the second peak continues to increase.
4. Hydrogen effectively prevents coke formation and deactivation but fails to eliminate existing coke on the catalyst.

1. 第一个两个峰的焦炭形成受温度和丙烯分压的影响，而氢气减少了这种形成。
2. 第三种焦炭在载体上的形成与前两个峰值通过不同的途径。
3. 第一个焦炭峰值在大约15小时后达到稳定状态，而第二个峰值继续增加。
4. 氢气有效地防止了焦炭的形成和失活，但无法消除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。
