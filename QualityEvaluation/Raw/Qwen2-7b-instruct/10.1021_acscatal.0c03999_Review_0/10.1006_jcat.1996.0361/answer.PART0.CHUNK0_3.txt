[1] "The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and environmental impact associated with steam裂解 processes."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by requiring less energy input compared to steam裂解."
[3] "However, the choice of oxidant is critical in ODHP, as it affects the energy efficiency and environmental footprint of the process."
[4] "Specific challenges arise when using oxygen as the oxidant, including its potential for forming highly reactive species that can lead to catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The formation of coke during the ODHP process presents another significant challenge, as it can deactivate the catalyst and reduce productivity."
[6] "Despite these challenges, the use of ODHP for propylene production offers advantages such as improved energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact compared to traditional methods."
