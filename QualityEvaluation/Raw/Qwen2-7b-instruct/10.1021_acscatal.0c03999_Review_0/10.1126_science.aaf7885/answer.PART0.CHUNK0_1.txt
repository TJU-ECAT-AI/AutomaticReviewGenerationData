[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[2] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins (2, 3)."
[3] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[4] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[5] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[6] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[7] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[8] "The analogous product distributions for both h-BN and BNNTs suggest a similar reaction mechanism for these BN materials."
[9] "Indeed,boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[10] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity,spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the conventional steam cracking process, which uses large hydrocarbons from naphtha. This method has led to a significant demand for propene and other higher olefins, creating a gap between supply and demand. Additionally, the process involves energy-intensive operations and potential inefficiencies. 

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially improving reaction efficiency through exothermic thermodynamics and lower reaction temperatures, which could lead to substantial energy savings. Moreover, ODHP offers enhanced catalyst stability, preventing the formation of coke on the catalyst surface.

3. ODHP has the potential to reduce the energy consumption by approximately 45% compared to conventional non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation techniques. This efficiency gain, combined with the growing demand for propene and other olefins, illustrates the significant impact of ODHP if implemented on a large scale.

4. The key scientific challenge for ODHP is the prevention of facile over-oxidation of propene products into more thermodynamically stable compounds like CO and CO2. This issue limits the practicality and economic viability of the process.

5. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibit exceptional selectivity for propene under ODHP conditions, surpassing many conventional catalysts. These materials demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the production of propene, making them promising alternatives for propylene synthesis.

6. The product distribution from ODHP using h-BN and BNNTs differs significantly from that achieved with conventional supported vanadia catalysts. These materials yield propene and ethene as primary products, with ethene being a highly valuable olefin, rather than the more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2.

7. The similar product distributions observed with h-BN and BNNTs suggest a comparable reaction mechanism for these boron nitride materials, indicating that they might share common active sites or pathways for the ODHP reaction.

8. The catalytic performance of boron nitride samples from different suppliers, despite containing varying impurities, shows almost identical results. This finding suggests that these impurities do not significantly affect the material's catalytic activity.

9. The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction involving boron nitride materials is an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN). This site is hypothesized to enable the oxidation reactions critical for the ODHP process.

10. The reaction mechanism for ODHP catalyzed by boron nitride materials is expected to involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the oxygen-terminated armchair edge, followed by a series of steps including radical formation, hydrogen abstraction, and desorption of propene and water, with regeneration of the active site.
