[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[4] "While gra- phene and fullerene materials are emerging as catalysts for partial alkane oxidations (911), BN materials, one of the inorganic analogues of graphene, have yet to be explored for their own catalytic activity."
[5] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[6] "The decrease in propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion is indicative of the facile over-oxidation of propene to COx."
[7] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[8] "For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A)."
[9] "Comparisons between key reaction parameters of the referenced catalysts are included in table S1."
[10] "We further studied the influence of reactant concentrations (PO2, PC3H8) on the reaction rate."
[11] "The rate of propane consumption using h-BN indicates oxygen activation on the BN surface (Fig. 2A) and second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 (Fig. 2B)."
[12] "This kinetic behavior clearly distinguishes boron nitride from traditional supported vanadia catalysts, which follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism."
[13] "Indeed, boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[14] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the inefficiency caused by the over-oxidation of propene into CO and CO2, which is more thermodynamically stable than propene. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by improving reaction efficiency through favorable thermodynamics and preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Additionally, it offers the potential for significant energy savings compared to non-oxidative methods.

2. ODHP presents advantages over non-oxidative methods due to its exothermic nature, leading to lower reaction temperatures, and enhanced catalyst stability, reducing the likelihood of coke formation. However, it also faces limitations, particularly concerning the prevention of facile over-oxidation of propene into COx.

3. The use of boron nitride (BN) materials for ODHP shows extraordinary selectivity to propene, achieving up to 79% selectivity at 14% propane conversion. This selectivity is notably higher than that of traditional vanadium oxide catalysts.

4. The decrease in propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion indicates the ease with which propene can be over-oxidized into COx. This challenge underscores the need for the discovery of alternative materials capable of better controlling the partial oxidation process.

5. The kinetic behavior of boron nitride materials during ODHP reactions clearly differentiates them from traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. Specifically, they demonstrate oxygen activation on the surface and exhibit a second-order dependence on propane concentration, unlike the Mars van Krevelen mechanism followed by traditional catalysts.

6. Boron nitride samples from various suppliers, despite containing different impurities, display almost identical catalytic performance, suggesting that these impurities do not significantly impact the material's activity.

7. Based on a combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations, it is proposed that an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN) acts as the active site for the ODHP reaction. This site enables oxidation reactions similar to those found in semiconductor literature and offers potential advantages in terms of radical stabilization and suppression of over-oxidation.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括丙烯过氧化成CO和CO2，这比丙烯更热力学稳定。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过有利的热力学特性以及防止催化剂表面焦炭沉积来解决这些问题，从而提高反应效率。此外，它有可能实现与非氧化方法相比大约45%的能量节省。

2. 与非氧化方法相比，ODHP的优势在于其放热性，导致较低的反应温度，以及增强的催化剂稳定性，减少了焦炭沉积的可能性。然而，它也面临挑战，特别是防止容易地将丙烯氧化为COx。

3. 使用硼氮（BN）材料进行ODHP显示对丙烯的异常高选择性，达到14%丙烷转化时高达79%的选择性。这一选择性明显高于传统二氧化钒催化剂。

4. 随着丙烷转化率的增加，丙烯选择性的下降表明丙烯容易被过氧化成COx。这表明必须克服的关键科学挑战是控制部分氧化过程。

5. 硼氮材料在ODHP反应中的动力学行为清楚地将其与传统二氧化钒催化剂区分开来。具体来说，它们显示出氧激活在表面以及丙烷浓度的二次依赖性，而传统的催化剂遵循马尔斯范克伦机制。

6. 不同供应商的硼氮样品，尽管含有不同的杂质，但其催化性能几乎相同，这表明这些杂质对材料的活性影响不大。

7. 根据催化活性、光谱数据和DFT计算的组合，提出一个氧分子连接到一个硼和一个氮原子上的结构（BN的氧终止的臂状边缘）作为ODHP反应的活性位点。这个位点能够执行半导体文献中发现的氧化反应，并且可能提供潜在优势，例如自由基的稳定性和抑制过氧化。
