[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[4] "As an example, at 10% propane conversion, the propene selectivity typically drops to less than 60% for such conventional catalysts."
[5] "The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to bet-ter control this partial oxidation (8)."
[6] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[7] "For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A)."
[8] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[9] "The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT: 975 m2 g1 versus h-BN: 161 m2 g1) (20); however, the rate of propane consumption is more than three times higher with BNNT than with h-BN when normalized for surface area (BNNT: 3.6 ×107 mol C3H8 s1 m2 versus h-BN: 1.1 × 107 mol C3H8 s1 m2)."
[10] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity [kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1] (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this "on-purpose" propene technology (15, 21)."
[11] "To better understand the catalytically active parts of the material and to provide evidence for oxygen functionali- zation of the BN surface when exposed to ODHP reaction conditions, we used a combination of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Attenuated Total Reflectance IR (ATR-IR), and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements to characterize the material before (fresh) and after (spent) exposure to the ODHP reaction mixture."
[12] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity,spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low propene selectivity, particularly after conversion of propane, and the risk of consecutive over-oxidation leading to the formation of CO and CO2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient process due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reactions at lower temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability, reducing the risk of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, achieving high propene selectivity remains a challenge, especially at moderate propane conversion levels.

2. The lack of kinetic control in propene production processes necessitates the discovery of alternative materials capable of better controlling partial oxidation reactions. Boron nitride (BN) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), exhibit exceptional selectivity to propene in ODHP, surpassing conventional catalysts. For example, at 14% propane conversion, h-BN yields a propene selectivity of 79%, significantly higher than the 61% selectivity achieved by traditional vanadium oxide catalysts under similar conditions.

3. BN materials demonstrate a distinct product distribution, with ethene as the predominant byproduct rather than COx, unlike traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The combined propene and ethene selectivity reaches 91% at 14% propane conversion using h-BN. Moreover, BN materials show enhanced stability, maintaining catalytic activity for at least 32 hours on stream, and the morphology of the h-BN material remains unchanged post-reaction, indicating excellent stability.

4. The high reactivity and selectivity of BNNTs result in a substantial increase in propene productivity, comparable to values considered attractive for commercial implementation of propene production technologies. This is attributed to the higher surface area of BNNTs compared to h-BN, as well as a higher rate of propane consumption when normalized for surface area.

5. To understand the catalytically active parts of BN materials, researchers utilized a combination of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Attenuated Total Reflectance IR (ATR-IR), and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to characterize the material before and after exposure to ODHP conditions. Spectroscopic analysis revealed an increase in surface oxygen content in spent h-BN materials, suggesting oxygen functionalization. Further, DFT calculations suggested that an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN acts as the active site for the ODHP reaction, similar to findings in semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN and proposed active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidations.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括丙烷转化后丙烯选择性较低，以及存在连续过度氧化的风险，导致生成CO和CO2。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更高效的流程来解决这些问题，该流程得益于有利的动力学（放热反应，较低温度）和催化剂稳定性增强，减少了催化剂表面焦炭沉积的风险。然而，在适度丙烷转化水平下实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。

2. 由于缺乏动力学控制，丙烯生产过程需要发现能够更好地控制部分氧化反应的替代材料。硼氮材料，包括六方硼氮（h-BN）和硼氮纳米管（BNNT），在ODHP条件下表现出对丙烯的异常高选择性，超过了传统氧化物催化剂。例如，在14%丙烷转化时，h-BN的丙烯选择性达到79%，远高于仅在9%丙烷转化时由传统氧化钒催化剂获得的61%选择性。

3. 硼氮材料显示出独特的产物分布，主要副产品为乙烯，而不是COx，与传统氧化钒催化剂不同。在14%丙烷转化时，h-BN的丙烯和乙烯总选择性达到91%。此外，BN材料展现出稳定的催化活性，至少可以维持32小时的连续运行，而且h-BN材料的形态在反应后没有变化，表明具有出色的稳定性。

4. BNNTs的高活性和选择性导致了丙烯生产力的显著增加，与被认为是商业实施丙烯生产技术有吸引力的价值相媲美。这归因于BNNTs相对h-BN更高的表面积，以及在单位面积上更高的丙烷消耗速率。

5. 为了理解BN材料的催化活性部分，研究人员使用了X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、衰减全反射红外光谱（ATR-IR）和差分反射红外傅里叶变换光谱（DRIFTS）等组合技术，对材料在暴露于ODHP条件前后进行了表征。光谱分析显示，使用过的h-BN材料中的表面氧含量增加，暗示了氧功能化。进一步的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，BN的氧终止的臂状边缘作为ODHP反应的活性位点，类似于半导体文献中针对BN的氧终止的臂状边缘的研究，以及在类似氧化作用中提出的石墨烯和富勒烯材料的活性位点。
