[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[5] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[6] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[7] "It is surprising that BN, a material known for its high stability under oxidative conditions (23, 24), is catalytically active at all."
[8] "To better understand the catalytically active parts of the material and to provide evidence for oxygen functionali- zation of the BN surface when exposed to ODHP reaction conditions, we used a combination of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Attenuated Total Reflectance IR (ATR-IR), and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements to characterize the material before (fresh) and after (spent) exposure to the ODHP reaction mixture."
[9] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges related to the prevention of consecutive over-oxidation of the desired product, which is often more reactive than the parent substrate. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface). This results in potential energy savings of around 45% and the potential for large-scale implementation, despite the inherent challenge of preventing the facile over-oxidation of propene into CO and CO2.

2. ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency compared to non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation because of its exothermic nature and lower reaction temperatures, leading to energy savings of approximately 45%. Additionally, ODHP has the advantage of enhanced catalyst stability, which prevents coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

3. The use of boron nitride (BN) materials in ODHP catalysis results in exceptional propene selectivity, among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. This selectivity is notably superior to that achieved with conventional catalysts, highlighting the unique properties of BN materials in ODHP.

4. The product distribution in ODHP catalysis using BN materials distinctly differs from that of conventional catalysts, with ethene as the main byproduct rather than COx. This further emphasizes the superior selectivity and efficiency of BN materials in ODHP.

5. Surprisingly, boron nitride (BN), known for its high stability under oxidative conditions, demonstrates catalytic activity in ODHP, challenging existing perceptions of its reactivity in oxidative environments.

6. The combination of spectroscopic techniques (XPS, ATR-IR, DRIFTS) reveals the presence of oxygen-functionalized sites on the BN surface, suggesting the role of oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN as the active sites in ODHP catalysis. This finding provides insights into the mechanism behind the enhanced selectivity and efficiency of BN materials in ODHP.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临的挑战与防止产物丙烯的连续过氧化有关，后者往往比母体基团更活泼。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过提供有利的动力学（放热、较低反应温度）和催化剂表面的焦炭沉积预防，解决这些问题，从而提高反应效率。这可能导致大约45%的能量节省，并且具有大规模实施的潜力，尽管防止丙烯易于过氧化成CO和CO2的挑战仍然存在。

2. 与非氧化丙烷脱氢相比，ODHP有可能通过其放热性质和较低的反应温度来提高反应效率，从而实现约45%的能量节省。此外，ODHP的优势在于催化剂稳定性增强，可以防止催化剂表面的焦炭沉积。

3. 在ODHP催化作用中使用硼氮（BN）材料导致极高的丙烯选择性，这是在ODHP条件下报道的最高选择性之一。这种选择性明显优于传统催化剂，突显了BN材料在ODHP中的独特性质。

4. 使用BN材料在ODHP催化下的产品分布与传统催化剂有显著不同，主要副产品为乙烷而非COx。这进一步强调了BN材料在ODHP中的优越选择性和效率。

5. 惊人地，硼氮（BN），在氧化环境下以高稳定性的著称，显示出在ODHP中的催化活性，颠覆了BN材料在氧化环境下的传统认知。

6. 结合光谱技术（XPS、ATR-IR、DRIFTS）揭示了BN表面上氧功能化位点的存在，表明BN材料上的氧终止的臂状边缘作为ODHP催化反应的活性位点的作用。这一发现提供了关于BN材料在ODHP中增强选择性和效率机制的见解。
