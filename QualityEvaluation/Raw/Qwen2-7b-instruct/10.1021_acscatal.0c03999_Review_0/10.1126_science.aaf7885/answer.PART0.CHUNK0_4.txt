[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[4] "This disparity motivates the exploration of on-purpose propene technologies."
[5] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[6] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[7] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[8] "Indeed,boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[9] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, specifically through steam cracking of large hydrocarbons, include high energy consumption, inefficient use of resources, and the production of undesired byproducts like CO and CO2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability, reducing the risk of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Additionally, ODHP has the potential for significant energy savings, around 45% of the energy consumption compared to traditional methods. This makes it an attractive technology for on-purpose propene production. However, a major scientific challenge is preventing the facile over-oxidation of propene into CO and CO2, which is thermodynamically more stable.

By using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), the selectivity to propene in ODHP reactions has significantly improved. These materials exhibit unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties, resulting in high selectivity to olefins. For example, at 14% propane conversion, they achieve selectivities of 79% propene and 12% ethene. The boron nitride materials also show enhanced stability and similar product distributions compared to supported vanadia catalysts, indicating a different reaction mechanism. The active sites identified for these reactions involve oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN, which can perform oxidation reactions similar to organic peroxides, contributing to the high olefin selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、资源利用效率低下以及生成CO和CO2等副产品。氧化脱氢法（ODHP）通过提供更低的反应温度和增强的催化剂稳定性，以及相比传统方法约45%的能量节省潜力，解决了这些问题，使其成为定向丙烯生产的有吸引力的技术。然而，防止丙烯过氧化为更热力学稳定的CO和CO2是必须克服的关键科学挑战。

通过使用六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs），在ODHP反应中的丙烯选择性显著提高。这些材料表现出独特的催化性能，导致高烯烃选择性。例如，在14%丙烷转化率时，它们能够实现79%丙烯和12%乙烯的选择性。这些氮化硼材料也显示了增强的稳定性和与支持的钒氧化物催化剂相似的产品分布，表明存在不同的反应机制。确定的活性位点涉及氮化硼的氧终止的臂状边缘，它可以执行类似于有机过氧化物的氧化反应，从而贡献到高的烯烃选择性。
