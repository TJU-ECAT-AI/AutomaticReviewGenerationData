1. Current propylene production methods face challenges related to the prevention of consecutive over-oxidation of the desired product, which is often more reactive than the parent substrate. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering improved reaction efficiency due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface). This results in potential energy savings of around 45% and the potential for large-scale implementation, despite the inherent challenge of preventing the facile over-oxidation of propene into CO and CO2.

2. ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency compared to non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation because of its exothermic nature and lower reaction temperatures, leading to energy savings of approximately 45%. Additionally, ODHP has the advantage of enhanced catalyst stability, which prevents coke deposition on the catalyst surface.

3. The use of boron nitride (BN) materials in ODHP catalysis results in exceptional propene selectivity, among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. This selectivity is notably superior to that achieved with conventional catalysts, highlighting the unique properties of BN materials in ODHP.

4. The product distribution in ODHP catalysis using BN materials distinctly differs from that of conventional catalysts, with ethene as the main byproduct rather than COx. This further emphasizes the superior selectivity and efficiency of BN materials in ODHP.

5. Surprisingly, boron nitride (BN), known for its high stability under oxidative conditions, demonstrates catalytic activity in ODHP, challenging existing perceptions of its reactivity in oxidative environments.

6. The combination of spectroscopic techniques (XPS, ATR-IR, DRIFTS) reveals the presence of oxygen-functionalized sites on the BN surface, suggesting the role of oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN as the active sites in ODHP catalysis. This finding provides insights into the mechanism behind the enhanced selectivity and efficiency of BN materials in ODHP.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the conventional steam cracking process, which uses large hydrocarbons from naphtha. This method has led to a significant demand for propene and other higher olefins, creating a gap between supply and demand. Additionally, the process involves energy-intensive operations and potential inefficiencies. 

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially improving reaction efficiency through exothermic thermodynamics and lower reaction temperatures, which could lead to substantial energy savings. Moreover, ODHP offers enhanced catalyst stability, preventing the formation of coke on the catalyst surface.

3. ODHP has the potential to reduce the energy consumption by approximately 45% compared to conventional non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation techniques. This efficiency gain, combined with the growing demand for propene and other olefins, illustrates the significant impact of ODHP if implemented on a large scale.

4. The key scientific challenge for ODHP is the prevention of facile over-oxidation of propene products into more thermodynamically stable compounds like CO and CO2. This issue limits the practicality and economic viability of the process.

5. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) exhibit exceptional selectivity for propene under ODHP conditions, surpassing many conventional catalysts. These materials demonstrate high activity and selectivity in the production of propene, making them promising alternatives for propylene synthesis.

6. The product distribution from ODHP using h-BN and BNNTs differs significantly from that achieved with conventional supported vanadia catalysts. These materials yield propene and ethene as primary products, with ethene being a highly valuable olefin, rather than the more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2.

7. The similar product distributions observed with h-BN and BNNTs suggest a comparable reaction mechanism for these boron nitride materials, indicating that they might share common active sites or pathways for the ODHP reaction.

8. The catalytic performance of boron nitride samples from different suppliers, despite containing varying impurities, shows almost identical results. This finding suggests that these impurities do not significantly affect the material's catalytic activity.

9. The proposed active site for the ODHP reaction involving boron nitride materials is an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN). This site is hypothesized to enable the oxidation reactions critical for the ODHP process.

10. The reaction mechanism for ODHP catalyzed by boron nitride materials is expected to involve the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the oxygen-terminated armchair edge, followed by a series of steps including radical formation, hydrogen abstraction, and desorption of propene and water, with regeneration of the active site.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the inefficiency caused by the over-oxidation of propene into CO and CO2, which is more thermodynamically stable than propene. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by improving reaction efficiency through favorable thermodynamics and preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Additionally, it offers the potential for significant energy savings compared to non-oxidative methods.

2. ODHP presents advantages over non-oxidative methods due to its exothermic nature, leading to lower reaction temperatures, and enhanced catalyst stability, reducing the likelihood of coke formation. However, it also faces limitations, particularly concerning the prevention of facile over-oxidation of propene into COx.

3. The use of boron nitride (BN) materials for ODHP shows extraordinary selectivity to propene, achieving up to 79% selectivity at 14% propane conversion. This selectivity is notably higher than that of traditional vanadium oxide catalysts.

4. The decrease in propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion indicates the ease with which propene can be over-oxidized into COx. This challenge underscores the need for the discovery of alternative materials capable of better controlling the partial oxidation process.

5. The kinetic behavior of boron nitride materials during ODHP reactions clearly differentiates them from traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. Specifically, they demonstrate oxygen activation on the surface and exhibit a second-order dependence on propane concentration, unlike the Mars van Krevelen mechanism followed by traditional catalysts.

6. Boron nitride samples from various suppliers, despite containing different impurities, display almost identical catalytic performance, suggesting that these impurities do not significantly impact the material's activity.

7. Based on a combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data, and DFT calculations, it is proposed that an oxygen molecule bonded to one boron and one nitrogen atom (an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN) acts as the active site for the ODHP reaction. This site enables oxidation reactions similar to those found in semiconductor literature and offers potential advantages in terms of radical stabilization and suppression of over-oxidation.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low propene selectivity, particularly after conversion of propane, and the risk of consecutive over-oxidation leading to the formation of CO and CO2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient process due to favorable thermodynamics (exothermic reactions at lower temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability, reducing the risk of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. However, achieving high propene selectivity remains a challenge, especially at moderate propane conversion levels.

2. The lack of kinetic control in propene production processes necessitates the discovery of alternative materials capable of better controlling partial oxidation reactions. Boron nitride (BN) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), exhibit exceptional selectivity to propene in ODHP, surpassing conventional catalysts. For example, at 14% propane conversion, h-BN yields a propene selectivity of 79%, significantly higher than the 61% selectivity achieved by traditional vanadium oxide catalysts under similar conditions.

3. BN materials demonstrate a distinct product distribution, with ethene as the predominant byproduct rather than COx, unlike traditional vanadium oxide catalysts. The combined propene and ethene selectivity reaches 91% at 14% propane conversion using h-BN. Moreover, BN materials show enhanced stability, maintaining catalytic activity for at least 32 hours on stream, and the morphology of the h-BN material remains unchanged post-reaction, indicating excellent stability.

4. The high reactivity and selectivity of BNNTs result in a substantial increase in propene productivity, comparable to values considered attractive for commercial implementation of propene production technologies. This is attributed to the higher surface area of BNNTs compared to h-BN, as well as a higher rate of propane consumption when normalized for surface area.

5. To understand the catalytically active parts of BN materials, researchers utilized a combination of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Attenuated Total Reflectance IR (ATR-IR), and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) to characterize the material before and after exposure to ODHP conditions. Spectroscopic analysis revealed an increase in surface oxygen content in spent h-BN materials, suggesting oxygen functionalization. Further, DFT calculations suggested that an oxygen-terminated armchair edge of BN acts as the active site for the ODHP reaction, similar to findings in semiconductor literature focusing on oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN and proposed active sites of graphene and fullerene materials for similar oxidations.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括丙烷转化后丙烯选择性较低，以及存在连续过度氧化的风险，导致生成CO和CO2。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更高效的流程来解决这些问题，该流程得益于有利的动力学（放热反应，较低温度）和催化剂稳定性增强，减少了催化剂表面焦炭沉积的风险。然而，在适度丙烷转化水平下实现高丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。

2. 由于缺乏动力学控制，丙烯生产过程需要发现能够更好地控制部分氧化反应的替代材料。硼氮材料，包括六方硼氮（h-BN）和硼氮纳米管（BNNT），在ODHP条件下表现出对丙烯的异常高选择性，超过了传统氧化物催化剂。例如，在14%丙烷转化时，h-BN的丙烯选择性达到79%，远高于仅在9%丙烷转化时由传统氧化钒催化剂获得的61%选择性。

3. 硼氮材料显示出独特的产物分布，主要副产品为乙烯，而不是COx，与传统氧化钒催化剂不同。在14%丙烷转化时，h-BN的丙烯和乙烯总选择性达到91%。此外，BN材料展现出稳定的催化活性，至少可以维持32小时的连续运行，而且h-BN材料的形态在反应后没有变化，表明具有出色的稳定性。

4. BNNTs的高活性和选择性导致了丙烯生产力的显著增加，与被认为是商业实施丙烯生产技术有吸引力的价值相媲美。这归因于BNNTs相对h-BN更高的表面积，以及在单位面积上更高的丙烷消耗速率。

5. 为了理解BN材料的催化活性部分，研究人员使用了X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、衰减全反射红外光谱（ATR-IR）和差分反射红外傅里叶变换光谱（DRIFTS）等组合技术，对材料在暴露于ODHP条件前后进行了表征。光谱分析显示，使用过的h-BN材料中的表面氧含量增加，暗示了氧功能化。进一步的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，BN的氧终止的臂状边缘作为ODHP反应的活性位点，类似于半导体文献中针对BN的氧终止的臂状边缘的研究，以及在类似氧化作用中提出的石墨烯和富勒烯材料的活性位点。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, specifically through steam cracking of large hydrocarbons, include high energy consumption, inefficient use of resources, and the production of undesired byproducts like CO and CO2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with lower reaction temperatures and enhanced catalyst stability, reducing the risk of coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Additionally, ODHP has the potential for significant energy savings, around 45% of the energy consumption compared to traditional methods. This makes it an attractive technology for on-purpose propene production. However, a major scientific challenge is preventing the facile over-oxidation of propene into CO and CO2, which is thermodynamically more stable.

By using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), the selectivity to propene in ODHP reactions has significantly improved. These materials exhibit unique and hitherto unanticipated catalytic properties, resulting in high selectivity to olefins. For example, at 14% propane conversion, they achieve selectivities of 79% propene and 12% ethene. The boron nitride materials also show enhanced stability and similar product distributions compared to supported vanadia catalysts, indicating a different reaction mechanism. The active sites identified for these reactions involve oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN, which can perform oxidation reactions similar to organic peroxides, contributing to the high olefin selectivity.
