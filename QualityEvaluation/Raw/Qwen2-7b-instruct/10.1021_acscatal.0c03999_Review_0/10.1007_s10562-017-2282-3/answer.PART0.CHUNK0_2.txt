[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feed stocks in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is a versatile starting material for synthesis of numerous commodity chemicals ranging from small molecules (isopropanol, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, butyraldehyde, and cumene) to very complex molecules (polypropylene, plastics, and paints)."
[2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations."
[3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity."
[4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
[5] "As known, the issue of CO2 emission has become one of the main subjects nowadays in the environmental chemistry. Interestingly, the CO2 as soft oxidant has also been reported to shift the equilibrium to the product side, and promote the dehydrogenation through the reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[6] "However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."
[7] "Of course, chromium is one of the key components in various commercial catalysts, including polymerization catalysts (Phillips catalyst) [16, 17], oxidation catalysts [18], and photocatalysts [19, 20]."
[8] "It is a known fact in the literature that the catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface."
[9] "As revealed by our earlier study, the Ti-TUD-1 obtained by microwave (MW) irradiation technique exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation of cyclic olefins [28, 35]."
[10] "The better catalytic activity of Ti-TUD-1 originates from both high accessibility of the substrate to the catalytic active sites provided by the three-dimensional mesopore system, and from the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on the surface of the mesopore walls."
[11] "The MW irradiation has received a tremendous interest, and it has been regarded as a novel synthesis tool for making of different materials owing to several advantages such as homogeneous nucleation to provide smaller and uniform crystals having rather larger external surfaces, rapid decrease in the synthesis time, phase controlled synthesis, facile morphology control, greener synthesis by energy efficient way, and so on."

1. Current propylene production methods involve steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation. These processes have high energy requirements and necessitate catalyst regeneration, leading to thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane offers an alternative with lower energy needs, no catalyst regeneration requirement, and avoids thermodynamic constraints. However, the use of oxygen in the process can lead to flammability and the formation of unwanted carbon oxides, negatively impacting selectivity.

2. Carbon dioxide, being a safer, milder, and readily available oxidant, addresses the safety concerns associated with oxygen usage. Moreover, CO2 can shift the equilibrium towards product formation and facilitate dehydrogenation through the coupling of propane dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

3. Designing a catalytic system with high propylene yield and selectivity presents a challenge due to the tendency of alkenes to undergo further oxidation. Chromium plays a critical role in various industrial catalysts, such as polymerization, oxidation, and photocatalysts.

4. The nature of chromium species on the support surface determines the catalytic activity of chromium-loaded catalysts. Chromium's role in the dehydrogenation reaction is influenced by its valence state, coordination number, molecular structure, bulk oxide features, and surface density.

5. The Ti-TUD-1 catalyst, synthesized via microwave irradiation, demonstrates excellent activity in the oxidation of cyclic olefins. Its enhanced catalytic performance is attributed to the combination of high substrate accessibility provided by the three-dimensional mesopore system and the formation of a titanium-enriched layer on the mesopore walls.

6. Microwave irradiation is a promising synthesis technique for creating materials due to its ability to facilitate homogeneous nucleation, produce smaller and uniform crystals, reduce synthesis time, enable phase-controlled synthesis, offer facile morphology control, and promote greener synthesis through energy-efficient methods.
