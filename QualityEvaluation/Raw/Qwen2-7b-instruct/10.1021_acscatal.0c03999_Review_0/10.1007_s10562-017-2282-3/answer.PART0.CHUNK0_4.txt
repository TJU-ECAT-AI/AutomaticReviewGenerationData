[1] "A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane."
[2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations."
[3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity."
[4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
[5] "It is a known fact in the literature that the catalytic activity of Cr-loaded catalysts is determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface."
[6] "The TUD-1 (Technische Universiteit Delft), a unique three dimensional mesoporous network structure, synthesized by an unconventional non-templating method employing a cheap structure directing agent, namely, triethanolamine (TEA) has attracted a lot of attention recently as an interesting porous material."
[7] "The better catalytic activity of Ti-TUD-1 originates from both high accessibility of the substrate to the catalytic active sites provided by the three-dimensional mesopore system, and from the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on the surface of the mesopore walls."
[8] "Further, the use of MW technique for the synthesis of nanoporous materials allows relatively facile incorporation of hetero-atoms into the zeolitic frameworks, more hydrophobicity, and higher thermal stability than those of hydrothermally synthesized materials."
[9] "As can be noted from Fig. 1, there is a variation in the peak positions based on the Cr content in the samples."
[10] "Interestingly, relatively high specific surface areas were observed for all the samples ranging from 600 to 1100 m2 g1 as presented in Table 1."
[11] "In the 2θ range of 570, the broad diffraction lines corresponding to the crystalline phase of the α-Cr2O3 were detected."
[12] "The presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures."
[13] "The UVvis DRS measurements of the synthesized samples were done under ambient conditions, and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 3."
[14] "The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts along with the amount of coke formed is displayed in Table 2."
[15] "The decrease in the surface area as well as pore volume is more in case of higher Cr loading samples (7 and 9%) where the pores are assumed to have coke deposits on the metal surfaces which are trapped in the pores."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, involve high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic constraints. However, ODHP faces challenges related to process flammability and poor product selectivity due to over-oxidation. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant mitigates these issues by providing a safer and more readily available alternative to oxygen. Chromium-loaded catalysts, with their activity determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface, are particularly effective in ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability. The specific surface area and pore volume of the Cr-TUD-1 catalysts were found to range from 600 to 1100 m²/g, with the presence of chromium leading to the formation of both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, which are crucial for the observed catalytic activity. Higher chromium loadings resulted in decreased surface area and pore volume due to coke formation on the metal surfaces.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、催化剂再生需求以及热力学限制。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能的过程、消除催化剂再生的需求，并克服热力学限制，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP面临过程可燃性和产品选择性差的问题，这是由于过氧化造成的。通过使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂，可以缓解这些问题，因为它提供了比氧气更安全且更容易获得的替代品。含有铬的催化剂，其活性由支持表面上的铬物种的性质决定，特别适用于ODHP过程。由于其独特的三维微孔网络结构，TUD-1材料提供了改善的催化活性，通过提供高的底物可接近性和促进其表面上形成的钛富集相来实现。微波合成技术增强了异质原子的掺入、增加了疏水性，并提高了热稳定性。Cr-TUD-1催化剂的表面积和孔体积范围从600到1100 m²/g，由于铬的存在，形成了Cr6+和Cr3+物种，这对观察到的催化活性至关重要。更高含量的铬负载导致表面面积和孔体积降低，这归因于金属表面沉积的焦炭在孔中形成。
