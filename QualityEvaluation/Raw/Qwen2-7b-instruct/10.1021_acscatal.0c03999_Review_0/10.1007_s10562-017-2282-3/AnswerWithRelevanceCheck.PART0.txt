          "[1] Propylene is one of the most important feed stocks in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is a versatile starting material for synthesis of numerous commodity chemicals ranging from small molecules (isopropanol, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, butyraldehyde, and cumene) to very complex molecules (polypropylene, plastics, and paints)."
          "[2] Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations."
          "[3] However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity."
          "[4] This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
          "[5] As known, the issue of CO2 emission has become one of the main subjects nowadays in the environmental chemistry."
          "[6] Interestingly, the CO2 as soft oxidant has also been reported to shift the equilibrium to the product side, and promote the dehydrogenation through the reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
          "[7] However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic constraints. However, ODHP faces challenges related to process flammability and poor product selectivity due to over-oxidation. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant mitigates these issues by providing a safer and more readily available alternative to oxygen. Chromium-loaded catalysts, with their activity determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface, are particularly effective in ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability.

          当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、催化剂再生需求以及热力学限制。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能的过程、消除催化剂再生的需求，并克服热力学限制，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP面临过程可燃性和产品选择性差的问题，这是由于过氧化造成的。通过使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂，可以缓解这些问题，因为它提供了比氧气更安全且更容易获得的替代品。含有铬的催化剂，其活性由支持表面上的铬物种的性质决定，特别适用于ODHP过程。由于其独特的三维微孔网络结构，TUD-1材料提供了改善的催化活性，通过提供高的底物可接近性和促进其表面上形成的钛富集相来实现。微波合成技术增强了异质原子的掺入、增加了疏水性，并提高了热稳定性。

          Various transition metals, including vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and others supported on carriers like metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites, have been studied for more effective catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, lack of catalyst regeneration need, and avoidance of thermodynamic limitations. However, the presence of oxygen in the ODH process can lead to process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. This issue can be addressed by using a safer, milder, and more readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. It is known that the catalytic activity of chromium-loaded catalysts depends on the nature of chromium species on the support surface. The TUD-1 material, featuring a unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure synthesized using a non-template method with a cheap structure directing agent, triethanolamine (TEA), has garnered attention as an interesting porous material. The enhanced catalytic activity of Ti-TUD-1 is attributed to the high accessibility of the substrate to catalytic active sites provided by the three-dimensional mesopore system and the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on the surface of the mesopore walls. Microwave synthesis techniques facilitate the relatively easy incorporation of hetero-atoms into zeolitic frameworks, increasing hydrophobicity, and improving thermal stability compared to hydrothermally synthesized materials. The UVvis DRS measurements of the synthesized samples were conducted under ambient conditions, and the spectra are depicted in Figure 3. The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts, along with the amount of coke formed, are shown in Table 2. The decrease in surface area and pore volume is more pronounced in samples with higher chromium loading (7 and 9%), suggesting that the pores may have coke deposits on the metal surfaces trapped within the pores.

          各种过渡金属，包括钒、铬、钼和其他在金属氧化物、微孔材料和沸石等载体上的金属，已被研究用作轻烷烃如丙烷的氧化脱氢的更有效催化剂。氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了一个有利的替代方案，因为它具有低能量需求、无需催化剂再生需求，并避免了热力学限制。然而，在ODH过程中氧气的存在可能导致过程可燃性和产生碳氧化物，这是由于过氧化导致的产品选择性差。可以通过使用更安全、温和且易于获取的二氧化碳作为软氧化剂来解决这个问题。文献中已知，负载有铬的催化剂的催化活性取决于支持表面的铬物种的性质。具有独特三维微孔网络结构的TUD-1材料，通过非模板方法使用廉价的结构导向剂三乙醇胺（TEA）合成，最近吸引了大量关注作为有趣的多孔材料。Ti-TUD-1的增强催化活性归因于三维微孔系统为底物提供的高活性位点可接近性和在微孔壁表面上形成的钛富集相。微波合成技术有助于相对容易地将异质原子引入到沸石框架中，增加疏水性，并提高与水热合成材料相比的热稳定性。在室温下对合成样品进行了紫外可见光吸收光谱测量，结果在图3中展示。用于催化剂的特定表面积和孔体积，以及形成的焦炭量，在表2中显示。在较高铬负载（7和9％）的样本中，表面积和孔体积的减少更为明显，这表明孔可能包含金属表面上的焦炭沉积物，这些沉积物被困在孔内。
