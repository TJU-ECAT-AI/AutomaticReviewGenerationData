[1] "A series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various loadings of chromium (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by microwave irradiation and explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene utilizing CO2 as soft oxidant."
[2] "The microwave irradiation reduced the synthesis time and the resulting Cr-TUD-1 catalysts exhibited a high specific surface area of more than 600 m2 g1."
[3] "The synthesized catalysts were characterized by various techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution to understand the physicochemical properties, and to correlate with the catalytic activity."
[4] "As revealed by the characterization techniques, the inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species are very crucial for the observed better catalytic activity of these materials."
[5] "The TUD-1 enables to encapsulate the chromium nanoparticles in the porous silica structure with high dispersion which help in maintaining the better catalytic performance."
[6] "The present study was undertaken against the aforesaid background. In this investigation, chromium containing Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various Cr loadings (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by MW irradiation and characterized by different techniques."
[7] "The UVvis DRS measurements of the synthesized samples were done under ambient conditions, and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 3."
[8] "The presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures."
[9] "The XPS results fairly corroborated well with the XRD and UVvis DRS results."
[10] "The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts along with the amount of coke formed is displayed in Table 2."
[11] "To understand the significance of CO2 in the ODH of propane over Cr-TUD-1 catalysts, the reaction was performed at 550 C on 7 wt% catalyst in the presence and absence (with He) of CO2 under identical conditions."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation, include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration obligations, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and potentially enhancing product selectivity. However, ODHP faces challenges related to oxidant selection and the specific difficulties in achieving optimal process selectivity, particularly when oxygen is used as an oxidant. CO2 presents an advantageous soft oxidant in ODHP as it can shift the equilibrium towards the product side and reduce the formation of unwanted carbon oxides. The use of CO2 also helps in the dehydrogenation process by promoting the formation of propylene more effectively than cracking products.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、催化剂再生义务以及热力学限制。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能的过程、消除催化剂再生需求，并可能提高产物选择性来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和实现最佳过程选择性方面面临挑战，特别是当使用氧气作为氧化剂时。二氧化碳作为软氧化剂在ODHP中的应用具有优势，因为它可以将平衡移向产物侧并减少碳氧化物的形成。二氧化碳也有助于促进脱氢过程，更有效地促进丙烯的形成，而不是裂解产品。
