[1] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations."
[2] "However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."
[3] "As revealed by our earlier study, the Ti-TUD-1 obtained by microwave (MW) irradiation technique exhibits excellent catalytic activity for oxidation of cyclic olefins."
[4] "Further, the use of MW technique for the synthesis of nanoporous materials allows relatively facile incorporation of hetero-atoms into the zeolitic frameworks, more hydrophobicity, and higher thermal stability than those of hydrothermally synthesized materials."
[5] "The absence of crystalline peaks pertaining to chromium oxide could be attributed to several factors, such as incorporation of Cr ions into the silica matrix, amorphous nature of the chromium oxide or a high dispersion of Cr species in the TUD-1 matrix."
[6] "The presence of Cr6+ is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination procedures."
[7] "Interestingly, the investigated Cr-TUD-1 catalysts showed smaller pore size when moved to higher loadings indicating pore-filling of the metal oxides thereby narrowing the pore size as evidenced by the pore size distribution measurements."
[8] "The UV bands at around 268 and 370 nm are assigned to the charge transfer bands between O2   Cr6+, and the bands at 460 and 600 nm are attributed to the presence of an octahedral Cr3+ in the Cr2O3 or CrOx."
[9] "The presence of Cr6+ polymeric species is crucial for high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2."
[10] "The deactivation parameter, as defined bellow (Eq. 1), was estimated and the results are shown in Fig. S3:"

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers advantages in terms of low energy requirements, no need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic limitations.

2. Designing a catalytic system for oxidative dehydrogenation that yields high propylene with good selectivity is challenging due to the tendency of formed alkenes to further oxidize.

3. Earlier studies have shown that Ti-TUD-1, obtained via microwave irradiation, exhibits excellent activity in the oxidation of cyclic olefins.

4. The microwave technique facilitates easier incorporation of hetero-atoms into zeolitic frameworks, enhancing hydrophobicity and thermal stability compared to hydrothermally synthesized materials.

5. The absence of crystalline chromium oxide peaks in the samples can be attributed to Cr ions being incorporated into the silica matrix, the amorphous nature of the oxide, or a high dispersion of Cr species in the TUD-1 matrix.

6. The presence of Cr6+ species is expected from the oxidation of Cr3+ during the preparation and calcination processes.

7. Higher chromium loadings resulted in smaller pore sizes, indicating the filling of metal oxides that narrowed the pore size, as evidenced by pore size distribution measurements.

8. UV bands at 268 and 370 nm relate to charge transfer between O2 and Cr6+, while bands at 460 and 600 nm indicate the presence of octahedral Cr3+ in Cr2O3 or CrOx.

9. The polymeric Cr2O3 species are essential for achieving high catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

10. The deactivation parameter was estimated, and the results are depicted in Figure S3.

1. 氧化脱氢（ODH）在低能耗、无需催化剂再生和克服热力学限制方面提供了有利的选择。

2. 设计能够高产丙烯并具有良好选择性的催化系统对于氧化脱氢而言具有挑战性，因为形成的烯烃倾向于进一步氧化。

3. 早期研究显示，通过微波照射制备的Ti-TUD-1在环状不饱和烃的氧化中表现出优异的活性。

4. 微波技术能够更容易地将杂原子引入到沸石框架中，提供更高的疏水性和比水热合成材料更高的热稳定性。

5. 样品中缺乏结晶铬氧化物峰可以归因于Cr离子被纳入硅酸盐矩阵、氧化物的非晶态性质或TUD-1矩阵中Cr物种的高度分散。

6. 预期Cr6+物种是在准备和煅烧过程中由Cr3+氧化产生的。

7. 更高的铬负载导致更小的孔径，这表明金属氧化物填充了孔隙，导致孔径变窄，这从孔径分布测量中得到证实。

8. 大约268和370 nm的UV带与O2和Cr6+之间的电荷转移相关联，而460和600 nm的带则归因于Cr2O3或CrOx中的八面体Cr3+的存在。

9. 在使用CO2进行脱氢的条件下，聚集体的Cr2O3物种对于实现丙烷脱氢的高催化活性至关重要。

10. 计算了去活参数，并在图S3中展示了结果。
