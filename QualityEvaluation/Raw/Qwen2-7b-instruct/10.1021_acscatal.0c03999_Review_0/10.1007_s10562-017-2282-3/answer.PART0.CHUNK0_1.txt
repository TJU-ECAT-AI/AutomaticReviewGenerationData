[1] "Propylene is one of the most important feed stocks in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is a versatile starting material for synthesis of numerous commodity chemicals ranging from small molecules (isopropanol, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, butyraldehyde, and cumene) to very complex molecules (polypropylene, plastics, and paints)."
[2] "On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations."
[3] "However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity."
[4] "This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
[5] "As known, the issue of CO2 emission has become one of the main subjects nowadays in the environmental chemistry."
[6] "Interestingly, the CO2 as soft oxidant has also been reported to shift the equilibrium to the product side, and promote the dehydrogenation through the reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[7] "However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."

Answer: The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy requirements, the necessity for catalyst regeneration, and the thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a low-energy process with no requirement for catalyst regeneration. However, the use of oxygen presents challenges related to flammability and poor selectivity due to over-oxidation. These issues are mitigated by employing carbon dioxide as a softer oxidant. The environmental focus on CO2 emissions also highlights the importance of designing catalytic systems that can efficiently utilize CO2, shifting the equilibrium towards the product side and promoting dehydrogenation through the coupling of propane dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Despite these advantages, achieving high product yields and selectivity for propylene remains a challenge due to the tendency of formed alkenes to undergo further oxidation.

回答：当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、催化剂再生的需求以及热力学限制。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供低能耗过程和无需催化剂再生，解决了这些问题。然而，氧气的应用带来了与可燃性增加和过氧化导致的选择性差有关的问题。通过采用二氧化碳作为较温和的氧化剂，可以缓解这些问题。环境对二氧化碳排放的关注强调了设计能够高效利用二氧化碳的催化系统的重要性，通过耦合丙烷脱氢和逆水煤气变换反应来促进脱氢。尽管存在这些优势，但由于生成的烯烃倾向于进一步氧化，实现高产品收率和丙烯选择性仍然是一个挑战。
