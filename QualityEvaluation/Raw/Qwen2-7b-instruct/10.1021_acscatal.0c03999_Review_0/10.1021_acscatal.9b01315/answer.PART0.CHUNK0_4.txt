[1] "Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers,chemicals, and pharmaceuticals."
[2] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane.6,7 Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry.8 Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."
[3] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."
[4] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
[5] "However, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus generating great potential for new discoveries."
[6] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus generating great potential for new discoveries."
[7] "A possible strategy to suppress over-oxidation pathways is to apply the concept of redox-site isolation in a quasi-inert matrix in order to better control the surface-active oxygen species, thus tuning the oxidizing potential of the catalyst."
[8] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides (Figure 1)."
[9] "Detailed characterization of the samples elucidates on the structural and morphological stability of the catalysts upon exposure to the reaction environment."
[10] "Finally, CrPO is found as the most selective system,reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date."

1. Current propylene production methods, such as steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane, are energy-intensive, leading to the production of ethylene rather than propylene, creating a gap between propylene supply and demand. This necessitates the development of more efficient, selective, and one-step alkane oxidation processes for propylene production.
2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a proposed alternative to traditional methods, aiming to directly convert propane into propylene with reduced energy consumption. However, selecting the appropriate oxidant and addressing the specific challenges related to using oxygen in the process remain critical issues.

1. 当前用于生产丙烯的方法，如裂解石脑油或乙烷，能耗高，主要产生乙烯而非丙烯，这导致了丙烯供应与需求之间的缺口。因此，需要开发更高效、选择性更强且一步法烷烃氧化过程以生产丙烯。
2. 烷烃氧化脱氢（ODHP）是一种替代传统方法的提议，旨在直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少能源消耗。然而，在过程中选择合适的氧化剂并解决使用氧气的具体挑战仍然是关键问题。
