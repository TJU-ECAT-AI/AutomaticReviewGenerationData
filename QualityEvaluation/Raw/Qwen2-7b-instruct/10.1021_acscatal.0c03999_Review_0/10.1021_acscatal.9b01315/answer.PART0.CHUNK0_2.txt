[1] "Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers,chemicals, and pharmaceuticals."
[2] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane. Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."
[3] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."
[4] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."
[5] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
[6] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus generating great potential for new discoveries."
[7] "This is most likely to be attributed to the much higher reactivity of propane and/or propane derivatives compared to ethane-derived compounds,which renders selectivity control a formidable challenge."
[8] "Selective catalysts for ethylene production via EOC, including titanium oxide (TiO2) and bulk CeO2, have been shown to generate significant amounts of carbon oxides (COx; selectivity 40% and 70%, respectively) when assessed in POC."
[9] "A possible strategy to suppress over-oxidation pathways is to apply the concept of redox-site isolation in a quasi-inert matrix in order to better control the surface-active oxygen species, thus tuning the oxidizing potential of the catalyst."
[10] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides (Figure 1)."
[11] "In fact, these systems have been demonstrated as effective in several direct alkane oxidation routes, including oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, oxidative coupling of methane, partial alkane oxidation to oxygenates, and methane oxybromination."
[12] "This was corroborated by in-depth characterization by means of X-ray diffraction, Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies as well as scanning and high-resolution transmission electron microscopies, which showed no alternations in the structure and morphology after the long-term run."
[13] "Finally, selected systems representing each of the identified catalyst categories were assessed in the oxidation of propane and of HCl as well as in propyl chloride dehydrochlorination."
[14] "This analysis revealed that the phosphates reactivity is a function of the materials ability to evolve chlorine from its surface, while a high selectivity towards propylene is a consequence of fast dehydrochlorination kinetics in combination with a hindered ability to generate molecular chlorine in the gas phase and a low propensity towards propane cracking and combustion."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane, include high energy consumption and the production of ethylene instead of propylene, leading to a gap between propylene supply and demand. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient, one-step, and selective process for propylene production. However, ODHP faces challenges in selecting appropriate oxidants, particularly when using oxygen. Metal phosphates offer a viable solution for ODHP due to their ability to alter the electronic properties of metal oxide clusters within a phosphate matrix, which can enhance propylene selectivity. Redox-site isolation in a quasi-inert matrix can further control the oxidizing potential of the catalyst, suppressing over-oxidation pathways. The use of metal phosphates in ODHP has been demonstrated to be effective in various alkane oxidation routes, and their stability and selectivity were confirmed through extensive characterization techniques.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和乙烷裂解产生乙烯而非丙烯，导致丙烯供应与需求之间的差距。通过提供更节能、一步到位且选择性更强的过程，氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）解决了这些问题。然而，在使用氧气时，ODHP在选择合适的氧化剂方面面临挑战。金属磷酸盐为ODHP提供了一种可行的解决方案，因为它们能够改变金属氧化物簇在磷酸盐矩阵中的电子性质，从而增强丙烯的选择性。在惰性矩阵中实施还原-氧化位点隔离可以进一步控制催化剂的氧化潜能，抑制过氧化路径。已证明使用金属磷酸盐在各种烷烃氧化过程中是有效的，并通过广泛的表征技术证实了其稳定性和选择性。
