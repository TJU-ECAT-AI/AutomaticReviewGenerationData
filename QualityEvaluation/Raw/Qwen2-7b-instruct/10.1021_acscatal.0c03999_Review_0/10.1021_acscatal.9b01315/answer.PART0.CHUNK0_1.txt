[1] "Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers,chemicals, and pharmaceuticals."
[2] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."
[3] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."
[4] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."
[5] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."
[6] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
[7] "Intensive research efforts led to the discovery of efficient catalysts including iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), reaching propylene yields of  15%, 40%, and 55% at high (80-98%) selectivity, respectively."
[8] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demand and the production of ethylene rather than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a one-step, selective process for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of oxidants and the specific difficulties encountered when using oxygen. The challenges associated with using oxygen include the potential for unwanted side reactions and the need for optimized conditions to achieve high selectivity and efficiency.
