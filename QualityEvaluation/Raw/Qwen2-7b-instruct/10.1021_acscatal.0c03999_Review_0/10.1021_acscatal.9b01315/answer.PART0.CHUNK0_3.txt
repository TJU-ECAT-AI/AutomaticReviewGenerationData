[1] "Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers,chemicals, and pharmaceuticals."
[2] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."
[3] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."
[4] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."
[5] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."
[6] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
[7] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, thus generating great potential for new discoveries."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and the generation of ethylene rather than propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient and propylene-specific production method. However, ODHP faces challenges in selecting appropriate oxidants and dealing with the specific difficulties related to using oxygen. This includes the need for careful control of reaction conditions to ensure selectivity and efficiency, especially in managing the trade-offs between propylene yield and the risk of side reactions leading to the formation of other products like ethylene.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于高能耗以及主要生成乙烯而非丙烯。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种更节能且专为丙烯生产的生产方式，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在选择合适的氧化剂和处理使用氧气带来的特定困难方面面临挑战。这包括需要精心控制反应条件以确保选择性和效率，特别是在管理可能导致形成其他产品（如乙烯）的副反应之间的权衡时。
