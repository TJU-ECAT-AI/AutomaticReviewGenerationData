[1] "Vast natural gas reserves contains up to 10 mol.% of propane, offering the potential feedstock to manufacture propylene, a pivotal platform molecule for the production of polymers,chemicals, and pharmaceuticals."
[2] "Today, this olefin is mainly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane."
[3] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry."
[4] "Moreover, these processes largely yield ethylene, resulting in a gap between propylene production and demand."
[5] "It was predicted that the replacement of these technologies with on-purpose, one-step, and selective alkane oxidation processes would result in substantial economic benefits."
[6] "Among various strategies proposed, including the catalytic dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane,3,10-13 catalytic oxychlorination,which comprises the reaction of an alkane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and O2, has been demonstrated as an attractive route for the transformation of propane into propylene."
[7] "Intensive research efforts led to the discovery of efficient catalysts including iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), reaching propylene yields of  15%, 40%, and 55% at high (80-98%) selectivity, respectively."
[8] "Despite these promising results, few systems have been disclosed to date as catalysts for propane oxychlorination, POC, thus"
[9] "generating great potential for new discoveries."
[10] "This is most likely to be attributed to the much higher reactivity of propane and/or propane derivatives compared to ethane-derived compounds,which renders selectivity control a formidable challenge."
[11] "A possible strategy to suppress over-oxidation pathways is to apply the concept of redox-site isolation in a quasi-inert matrix in order to better control the surface-active oxygen species, thus tuning the oxidizing potential of the catalyst."
[12] "Metal phosphates represent a viable solution, since their crystal unit cells encapsulate metal oxide clusters (MOx) within a phosphate matrix, thereby altering the length, and thus the electronic properties, of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides (Figure 1)."
[13] "In fact, these systems have been demonstrated as effective in several direct alkane oxidation routes, including oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes,10,21 oxidative coupling of methane,22,23 partial alkane oxidation to oxygenates,24,25 and methane oxybromination,26 and could thus open new opportunities for the development of selective catalysts for propylene production via oxychlorination chemistry."
[14] "CrPO is found as the most selective system,reaching propylene yields that rivals the best catalysts reported to date."
[15] "Detailed characterization of the samples elucidates on the structural and morphological stability of the catalysts upon exposure to the reaction environment."
[16] "Finally, this catalyst was assessed in a long-term test at moderate propane conversion, evidencing its stable catalytic behavior for over 60 h in POC."

1. Current propylene production methods, such as steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane, are highly energy-intensive and yield ethylene instead of propylene, creating a production-demand gap. The proposed ODHP method aims to address these issues by providing a more efficient and selective process for propylene production.
2. Propane oxychlorination (POC) presents itself as an attractive route for transforming propane into propylene due to its potential to replace energy-intensive cracking processes and offer economic benefits. It involves the reaction of propane with hydrogen chloride (HCl) and oxygen (O2).
3. Existing catalysts, such as iron phosphate (FePO4), europium oxychloride (EuOCl), and nickel oxide modified ceria (NiO-CeO2), have demonstrated high propylene yields (15%, 40%, and 55%, respectively) with high selectivity (80-98%) in POC. However, these catalysts' selectivity control remains a challenge due to the higher reactivity of propane and its derivatives compared to ethane-derived compounds.
4. A key strategy to suppress over-oxidation pathways in POC is to isolate redox sites in a quasi-inert matrix, allowing for better control of surface-active oxygen species and tuning the oxidizing potential of the catalyst. Metal phosphates are a promising solution because their crystal structures encapsulate metal oxide clusters within a phosphate matrix, altering the electronic properties of MO bonds compared to bulk metal oxides.
5. In the study, chromium phosphate (CrPO) emerged as the most selective catalyst, achieving propylene yields that rival those of the best catalysts reported to date. This catalyst demonstrated remarkable stability in POC, maintaining its catalytic behavior for over 60 hours at moderate propane conversion levels.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法，如裂解石脑油或乙烷，能耗高且主要生成乙烯而不是丙烯，造成生产和需求之间的差距。拟议的氧化脱氢法（ODHP）旨在通过提供更高效和选择性的过程来解决这些问题，以实现丙烯生产。
2. 烷基氧氯化（POC）作为一种将丙烷转化为丙烯的有吸引力的途径，由于其潜在能力可以替代高能效的裂解过程并提供经济利益而被提出。该过程涉及丙烷与氢氯酸（HCl）和氧气（O2）反应。
3. 目前已知的催化剂，例如铁磷酸盐（FePO4）、铕氧氯化物（EuOCl）和镍氧化铈（NiO-CeO2），在丙烷氧氯化中显示出高达15%、40%和55%的高丙烯产率，同时具有高选择性（80-98%）。然而，这些催化剂的选择性控制仍然是一个挑战，原因在于丙烷及其衍生物的活性高于乙烷衍生化合物。
4. 在丙烷氧氯化中抑制过氧化路径的关键策略是在惰性矩阵中隔离还原性位点，允许更好地控制表面活性氧物种并调节催化剂的氧化潜力。金属磷酸盐是一种有前景的解决方案，因为它们的晶体结构将金属氧化物簇封装在磷酸盐矩阵中，从而改变MO键的长度和电子性质，与块状金属氧化物相比。
5. 在研究中，铬磷酸盐（CrPO）脱颖而出，成为最选择性的催化剂，实现了与当前最佳催化剂相当的高丙烯产率。该催化剂在丙烷氧氯化中表现出卓越的稳定性，维持其催化行为长达60小时以上，在适度的丙烷转化水平上。
