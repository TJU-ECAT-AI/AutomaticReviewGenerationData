Abstract Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions has been applied to elucidate the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of a reduced VOx(2.7 wt.%)/MCM-41 catalyst by gas-phase O2 or N2O.

It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance. Mesoporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites. As a result, propene selectivity increases while the opposite effect was observed when VxOy surface clusters are present at high vanadium loadings and/or supports with lower surface area [6,10,13].

When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,21-23]. A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24].

In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species.

In early electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies, the formation of O2, O, and O3 anion radicals was postulated upon reaction of gas-phase O2 with partially reduced V2O5/SiO2 catalysts [27-29]. The corresponding EPR spectra are characterized by superhyperfine structure multiplets. This superhyperfine features were interpreted as arising from the interaction of the unpaired electron located on the oxygen anion radicals with the nuclear spin of the 51V5+ cation, to which they were attached [27-29].

These oxygen species showed both high thermal stability up to 473 K and reactivity for oxidation of H2, CH4, and CO already at room temperature [29]. Based on this early work, similar EPR signals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite [30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were assigned to V O2 species. It was found that these species disappeared upon reaction with allyl alcohol or n-hexane. In a recent DFT study, the reoxidation of reduced V3+ and V4+ sites with O2 and N2O was evaluated [32]. These calculations suggest that a peroxovanadate species is formed when O2 is adsorbed on a V3+ site.

The formed peroxovanadate can decompose to yield a VO3+ vanadyl species and gas-phase O2 or react with another reduced V3+ site to produce two vanadyl species. In contrast, when N2O reacts with V3+, a vanadyl species is restored and N2 is formed. For analyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydrogen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates [32]. In this DFT study, the formation of vanadium sites coordinated by more than four oxygen ligands as well as vanadyl species with tetravalent vanadium, which in fact have been experimentally detected in VOx/MCM catalysts [10,33,34], were not taken into account.

Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O.

Propylene production faces challenges such as low olefin yields and poor olefin selectivity, often due to fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane to propene, a valuable petrochemical building block. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant instead of molecular oxygen (O2) leads to higher propene selectivity, as observed in studies involving steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. This improvement in selectivity is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O, leading to fewer active lattice oxygen sites and suppression of consecutive oxidation of propene.

In EPR studies, active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species were characterized. These species showed high thermal stability and reactivity with hydrocarbons like hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide at room temperature. The presence of such reactive oxygen species explains the higher propene selectivity observed with N2O in ODHP processes. The detailed nature of these species, including their stability and reactivity, is crucial for optimizing the ODHP process and enhancing propene selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法面临的主要挑战包括低烯烃产率和选择性差，通常由于目标烯烃快速连续氧化为碳氧化物。通过将丙烷氧化为丙烯，氧化脱氢过程（ODHP）解决了这些问题，将丙烷转化为有价值的石油化工基础原料。使用硝酸盐（N2O）作为氧化剂代替分子氧（O2），可以提高丙烯的选择性，如在蒸汽活化的铁基沸石、纯钒氧化物和含钒支持材料中观察到的那样。这种选择性的提高归因于N2O与还原VOx物种的缓慢再氧化，导致较少的活性晶格氧位点，并抑制了丙烯的连续氧化。

在EPR研究中，从O2和N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化过程中形成了活跃的氧物种。这些物种显示出在室温下的高热稳定性和与氢气、甲烷和一氧化碳等烃类的反应活性。这些活性氧物种的存在解释了使用N2O时在ODHP过程中观察到的更高丙烯选择性。了解这些物种的具体性质，包括其稳定性和反应性，对于优化ODHP过程并增强丙烯选择性至关重要。
