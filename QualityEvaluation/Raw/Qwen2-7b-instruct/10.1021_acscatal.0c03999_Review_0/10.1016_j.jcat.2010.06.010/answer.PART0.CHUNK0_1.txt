[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry."
[2] "However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications."
[3] "The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast con- secutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."
[4] "Extensive research has been done in the past to improve the catalyst selectiv- ity, and the relevant results have been reviewed during last 10 years [14]."
[5] "Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene,high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]."
[6] "Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."
[7] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
[8] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a con- sequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."
[9] "The higher activity but lower propene selectivity with O2 might be due to the formation of OxV5+  O2 , OxV5    O2 2 , and Vn+  O."
[10] "Such highly reactive species are not formed with N2O. In this case, the reaction probably proceeds by participation of nucleophilic oxide ions."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the low yields and selectivity of olefin production, particularly from propane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a method to convert abundant raw materials into valuable petrochemical building blocks. However, the process faces limitations such as low olefin selectivity, which arises from the rapid consecutive oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides. Extensive research has aimed to improve catalyst selectivity through the use of advanced materials, notably high surface area mesoporous silica materials with dispersed vanadium oxide species. These materials have achieved maximum propene yields up to 25%. Using nitrous oxide as an oxidizing agent has also shown promise in improving propene selectivity, as it reduces the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, thereby suppressing consecutive oxidation of olefins. The enhanced activity with oxygen might be attributed to the formation of reactive oxygen species, while nitrous oxide facilitates a more selective reaction pathway through nucleophilic oxide ion participation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于低产率和选择性，尤其是从丙烷生产。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种将廉价且丰富的原材料转化为现代石油化工行业有价值的构建块的方法来解决这些问题。然而，该过程面临着低烯烃选择性的限制，这源于目标烯烃的快速连续氧化到碳氧化物。已经进行了大量的研究，旨在通过使用先进材料提高催化剂选择性，特别是高表面积介孔硅材料与分散的钒氧化物物种。这些材料已实现最高丙烯产量高达25%。使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂也有助于提高丙烯选择性，因为它减少了活性晶格氧原子的稳态浓度，从而抑制了烯烃的连续氧化。氧增强活动可能归因于形成反应性氧物种，而氮氧化物则通过参与核碱氧离子促进了更选择性的反应途径。
