1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods is achieving high olefin yields and maintaining high olefin selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a promising alternative, providing an environmentally friendly way to convert abundant feedstocks into valuable building blocks for the petrochemical industry. 

2. Over the past decade, significant efforts have been made to enhance catalyst selectivity for ODHP. The best-performing catalysts can achieve up to 25% propene yields.

3. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent instead of molecular oxygen (O2) has led to a substantial improvement in propene selectivity in ODHP reactions compared to other catalyst systems.

4. Despite these advancements, ODHP reactions are yet to reach industrial application stages due to the inherent low olefin yields and selectivity issues.

5. The low olefin selectivity is mainly attributed to the rapid consecutive oxidation of target olefins to carbon oxides.

6. Researchers have observed that the activity of VOx sites for the consecutive oxidation of propene increases with the agglomerization degree of the catalyst particles.

7. In certain conditions, the use of N2O as an oxidant leads to a less pronounced negative impact on propene selectivity compared to O2.

8. The detrimental effect on propene selectivity is exacerbated when the catalyst contains dominant V2O5 nanocrystallites, which can lead to the total oxidation of propane.

9. A recent SSITKA study indicates that non-lattice oxygen species formed from gas-phase O2 play a role in the formation of COx compounds, suggesting that N2O may influence the selectivity of ODHP differently than O2.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the low yields and selectivity of olefin production, particularly from propane. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a method to convert abundant raw materials into valuable petrochemical building blocks. However, the process faces limitations such as low olefin selectivity, which arises from the rapid consecutive oxidation of olefins to carbon oxides. Extensive research has aimed to improve catalyst selectivity through the use of advanced materials, notably high surface area mesoporous silica materials with dispersed vanadium oxide species. These materials have achieved maximum propene yields up to 25%. Using nitrous oxide as an oxidizing agent has also shown promise in improving propene selectivity, as it reduces the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites, thereby suppressing consecutive oxidation of olefins. The enhanced activity with oxygen might be attributed to the formation of reactive oxygen species, while nitrous oxide facilitates a more selective reaction pathway through nucleophilic oxide ion participation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于低产率和选择性，尤其是从丙烷生产。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种将廉价且丰富的原材料转化为现代石油化工行业有价值的构建块的方法来解决这些问题。然而，该过程面临着低烯烃选择性的限制，这源于目标烯烃的快速连续氧化到碳氧化物。已经进行了大量的研究，旨在通过使用先进材料提高催化剂选择性，特别是高表面积介孔硅材料与分散的钒氧化物物种。这些材料已实现最高丙烯产量高达25%。使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂也有助于提高丙烯选择性，因为它减少了活性晶格氧原子的稳态浓度，从而抑制了烯烃的连续氧化。氧增强活动可能归因于形成反应性氧物种，而氮氧化物则通过参与核碱氧离子促进了更选择性的反应途径。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the low olefin yields and the difficulties in achieving high selectivity. Extensive research has been conducted to improve catalyst selectivity, with a focus on materials like mesoporous silica with high surface areas and dispersed vanadium oxide species (VOx). These materials can achieve up to 25% propene yields. The structure of VOx species and the surface properties of the catalyst, such as acidity and basicity, play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to enhance propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) due to its slower reoxidation rate of reduced VOx species, leading to lower concentrations of active lattice oxygen sites and suppression of consecutive propene oxidation. The activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with the agglomerization degree, but selectivity remains relatively stable until the vanadium surface concentration reaches monolayer coverage, where isolated VOx sites and small clusters dominate. The use of N2O in the ODP process has led to improved propene selectivity, especially when compared to O2, due to the slower reoxidation rate of reduced VOx species, which reduces the formation of detrimental products.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是低烯烃产率和高选择性的困难。已经进行了大量研究以提高催化剂的选择性，重点是具有高比表面积和分散的二氧化钒（VOx）物种的多孔硅材料。这些材料可以实现高达25％的丙烯产率。VOx物种的结构和催化剂的表面性质，如酸性和碱性，在确定催化性能中起着关键作用。已证明在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODP）过程中，与分子氧相比，使用氮氧化物（N2O）可以提高丙烯选择性，这是由于其还原态VOx物种的较慢氧化速率导致活性晶格氧位点浓度较低，从而抑制了连续的丙烯氧化。随着VOx位点的聚集程度增加，VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性也增加，但在范德华表面浓度达到单层覆盖时，选择性仍然相对稳定，此时主要存在孤立的VOx位点和小簇。在使用N2O进行ODP过程时，已经观察到丙烯选择性得到改善，尤其是与氧气相比，这是由于其还原态VOx物种的较慢氧化速率减少了有害产物的形成。

On the nature and reactivity of active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O on VOx/MCM-41 used for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
E.V. Kondratenko, A. Brckner *
Leibniz-Institut für Katalyse an der Universität Rostock e. V., Albert-Einstein-Straße 29a, D-18059 Rostock, Germany

Abstract Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy under controlled atmosphere conditions has been applied to elucidate the nature and reactivity of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of a reduced VOx(2.7 wt.%)/MCM-41 catalyst by gas-phase O2 or N2O.

It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance. Mesoporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites. As a result, propene selectivity increases while the opposite effect was observed when VxOy surface clusters are present at high vanadium loadings and/or supports with lower surface area [6,10,13].

When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,21-23]. A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24].

In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation. However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species.

In early electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies, the formation of O2, O, and O3 anion radicals was postulated upon reaction of gas-phase O2 with partially reduced V2O5/SiO2 catalysts [27-29]. The corresponding EPR spectra are characterized by superhyperfine structure multiplets. This superhyperfine features were interpreted as arising from the interaction of the unpaired electron located on the oxygen anion radicals with the nuclear spin of the 51V5+ cation, to which they were attached [27-29].

These oxygen species showed both high thermal stability up to 473 K and reactivity for oxidation of H2, CH4, and CO already at room temperature [29]. Based on this early work, similar EPR signals observed after oxygen adsorption on prereduced V silicalite [30] and after treatment of VS-1 with aqueous H2O2 [31] were assigned to V O2 species. It was found that these species disappeared upon reaction with allyl alcohol or n-hexane. In a recent DFT study, the reoxidation of reduced V3+ and V4+ sites with O2 and N2O was evaluated [32]. These calculations suggest that a peroxovanadate species is formed when O2 is adsorbed on a V3+ site.

The formed peroxovanadate can decompose to yield a VO3+ vanadyl species and gas-phase O2 or react with another reduced V3+ site to produce two vanadyl species. In contrast, when N2O reacts with V3+, a vanadyl species is restored and N2 is formed. For analyzing the reaction of N2O and O2 with tetravalent vanadium, a VAOH species was assumed as initial state, from which hydrogen abstraction by N2O or O2 should lead to a VO3+ vanadyl site and HO or HOO radicals, respectively, as primary intermediates [32]. In this DFT study, the formation of vanadium sites coordinated by more than four oxygen ligands as well as vanadyl species with tetravalent vanadium, which in fact have been experimentally detected in VOx/MCM catalysts [10,33,34], were not taken into account.

Based on the above background, it is the aim of this study to obtain experimental evidence on the nature and structure of oxygen species formed upon reoxidation of reduced highly dispersed VOx species supported over MCM-41 with O2 and N2O.

Propylene production faces challenges such as low olefin yields and poor olefin selectivity, often due to fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane to propene, a valuable petrochemical building block. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant instead of molecular oxygen (O2) leads to higher propene selectivity, as observed in studies involving steam-activated iron-containing zeolites, bulk vanadium oxides, and supported vanadium-containing materials. This improvement in selectivity is attributed to slower reoxidation of reduced VOx species by N2O, leading to fewer active lattice oxygen sites and suppression of consecutive oxidation of propene.

In EPR studies, active oxygen species formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species were characterized. These species showed high thermal stability and reactivity with hydrocarbons like hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide at room temperature. The presence of such reactive oxygen species explains the higher propene selectivity observed with N2O in ODHP processes. The detailed nature of these species, including their stability and reactivity, is crucial for optimizing the ODHP process and enhancing propene selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法面临的主要挑战包括低烯烃产率和选择性差，通常由于目标烯烃快速连续氧化为碳氧化物。通过将丙烷氧化为丙烯，氧化脱氢过程（ODHP）解决了这些问题，将丙烷转化为有价值的石油化工基础原料。使用硝酸盐（N2O）作为氧化剂代替分子氧（O2），可以提高丙烯的选择性，如在蒸汽活化的铁基沸石、纯钒氧化物和含钒支持材料中观察到的那样。这种选择性的提高归因于N2O与还原VOx物种的缓慢再氧化，导致较少的活性晶格氧位点，并抑制了丙烯的连续氧化。

在EPR研究中，从O2和N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化过程中形成了活跃的氧物种。这些物种显示出在室温下的高热稳定性和与氢气、甲烷和一氧化碳等烃类的反应活性。这些活性氧物种的存在解释了使用N2O时在ODHP过程中观察到的更高丙烯选择性。了解这些物种的具体性质，包括其稳定性和反应性，对于优化ODHP过程并增强丙烯选择性至关重要。
