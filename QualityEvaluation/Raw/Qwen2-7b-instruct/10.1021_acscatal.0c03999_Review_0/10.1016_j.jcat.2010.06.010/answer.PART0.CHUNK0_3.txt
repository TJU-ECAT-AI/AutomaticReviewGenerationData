[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry."
[2] "However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications."
[3] "Extensive research has been done in the past to improve the catalyst selectiv- ity, and the relevant results have been reviewed during last 10 years [14]."
[4] "Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene,high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]."
[5] "Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."
[6] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
[7] "Mes- oporous silica materials provide high surface areas and, hence, the potential for high dispersion of the catalytically active surface VOx sites."
[8] "As a result, propene selectivity increases while the opposite effect was observed when VxOy surface clusters are present at high vanadium loadings and/or supports with lower surface area [6,10,13]."
[9] "Furthermore, vanadium sites in tetrahedral oxygen coordination, being the major species on VOx/MCM catalysts with low vanadium loadings, appeared to be less active but more selective than those in octahedral oxygen coordination [10]."
[10] "Another advantage of mesoporous MCM-41 is the rather large pores and low intrinsic activity of highly dispersed VOx species for the ODP reaction."
[11] "As a result, mass transport within the pores does not limit the target reaction ensuring rapid diffusion of propene out of the pore system and, thus, reducing consecutive propene combustion."
[12] "Besides the structure of VOx species, surface acidbase properties determine the catalytic performance insofar as strongly acidic supports lower propene selectivities [16], while basic ones can im- prove it [17,18]."
[13] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also signifi- cantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-contain- ing materials [13,2123]."
[14] "A similar effect of N2O was also reported for the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane over vanadium magnesium oxide catalysts [24]."
[15] "Based on a kinetic analysis of the ODP reaction [13,14,25], the positive effect of N2O on the ODP reaction was explained as follows. In contrast to O2, reoxida- tion of reduced VOx species is slower with N2O, resulting in a lower steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen sites. As a con- sequence, consecutive oxidation of propene to carbon oxides is suppressed."
[16] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
[17] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration re- mained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
[18] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
[19] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."
[20] "However, only limited experimental information is available on the nature of active oxygen species, which are formed from O2 and N2O upon reoxidation of reduced VOx species."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the low olefin yields and the difficulties in achieving high selectivity. Extensive research has been conducted to improve catalyst selectivity, with a focus on materials like mesoporous silica with high surface areas and dispersed vanadium oxide species (VOx). These materials can achieve up to 25% propene yields. The structure of VOx species and the surface properties of the catalyst, such as acidity and basicity, play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance. Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been shown to enhance propene selectivity compared to molecular oxygen (O2) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) due to its slower reoxidation rate of reduced VOx species, leading to lower concentrations of active lattice oxygen sites and suppression of consecutive propene oxidation. The activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with the agglomerization degree, but selectivity remains relatively stable until the vanadium surface concentration reaches monolayer coverage, where isolated VOx sites and small clusters dominate. The use of N2O in the ODP process has led to improved propene selectivity, especially when compared to O2, due to the slower reoxidation rate of reduced VOx species, which reduces the formation of detrimental products.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是低烯烃产率和高选择性的困难。已经进行了大量研究以提高催化剂的选择性，重点是具有高比表面积和分散的二氧化钒（VOx）物种的多孔硅材料。这些材料可以实现高达25％的丙烯产率。VOx物种的结构和催化剂的表面性质，如酸性和碱性，在确定催化性能中起着关键作用。已证明在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODP）过程中，与分子氧相比，使用氮氧化物（N2O）可以提高丙烯选择性，这是由于其还原态VOx物种的较慢氧化速率导致活性晶格氧位点浓度较低，从而抑制了连续的丙烯氧化。随着VOx位点的聚集程度增加，VOx位点对连续丙烯氧化的活性也增加，但在范德华表面浓度达到单层覆盖时，选择性仍然相对稳定，此时主要存在孤立的VOx位点和小簇。在使用N2O进行ODP过程时，已经观察到丙烯选择性得到改善，尤其是与氧气相比，这是由于其还原态VOx物种的较慢氧化速率减少了有害产物的形成。
