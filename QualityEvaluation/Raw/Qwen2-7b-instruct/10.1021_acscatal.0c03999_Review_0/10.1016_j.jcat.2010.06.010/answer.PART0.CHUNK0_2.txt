[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry."
[2] "However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications. The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."
[3] "Extensive research has been done in the past to improve the catalyst selectiv- ity, and the relevant results have been reviewed during last 10 years [14]."
[4] "Among the multitude of catalytic materials tested for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene,high surface area (up to 1000 m2/g) mesoporous silica materials possessing highly dispersed surface VOx species belong to the best performing ones [515]."
[5] "It has been repeatedly reported that the interaction between the oxide support and the deposited vanadium oxide determines the structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance."
[6] "Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."
[7] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
[8] "However, propene selectivities did not differ much as long as the vanadium surface concentration remained below monolayer coverage, i. e., only isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters but no V2O5 nanocrystallites were present."
[9] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxida- tion of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."

1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods lies in the difficulty of achieving high olefin yields while maintaining high olefin selectivity. The issue stems from the rapid consecutive oxidation of target olefins to carbon oxides, leading to low efficiency and low propene yields.

2. Research has focused extensively on improving catalyst selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene over the past decade. High surface area mesoporous silica materials with dispersed VOx species have shown exceptional performance in this regard.

3. The structure of VOx species and their catalytic performance are significantly influenced by the interaction between the oxide support and deposited vanadium oxide.

4. With optimized conditions, these materials have achieved maximum propene yields of up to 25%.

5. The activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation tends to increase with the agglomerization degree of the material.

6. However, the propene selectivity does not vary significantly as long as the vanadium surface concentration remains below monolayer coverage, indicating the presence of isolated VOx sites and small two-dimensional VxOy clusters.

7. The presence of V2O5 nanocrystallites leads to a significant decrease in propene selectivity and direct propane oxidation, albeit less pronounced when using N2O as an oxidant.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于实现高烯烃产率的同时保持高烯烃选择性。问题源于目标烯烃的快速连续氧化为碳氧化物，导致效率低和丙烯产率低。

2. 过去十年，研究人员在提高氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）到丙烯的催化剂选择性方面进行了大量研究。具有分散VOx物种的高比表面积介孔二氧化硅材料在这方面表现出了优异性能。

3. VOx物种的结构及其催化性能受到氧化支持与沉积的钒氧化物之间相互作用的影响。

4. 在优化条件下，这些材料已实现高达25%的最大丙烯产率。

5. VOx位点的连续丙烯氧化活性随着材料团聚度的增加而增加。

6. 然而，在钒表面浓度保持在单层覆盖以下的情况下，丙烯选择性不会显著变化，表明存在孤立的VOx位点和二维VxOy簇。

7. 当存在V2O5纳米晶粒时，丙烯选择性会显著下降，并且发生直接的丙烷氧化，尽管使用N2O作为氧化剂时这种不利影响较小。
