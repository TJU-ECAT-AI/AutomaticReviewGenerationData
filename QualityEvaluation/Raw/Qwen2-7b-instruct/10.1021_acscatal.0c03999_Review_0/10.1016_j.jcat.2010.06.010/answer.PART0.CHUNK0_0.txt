[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (e.g. propane) to the corresponding olefins (e.g. propene) is a true challenge for catalysis research since it opens attractive ways for converting cheap and abundant raw materials to valuable building blocks for the modern petrochemical industry."
[2] "Extensive research has been done in the past to improve the catalyst selectivity, and the relevant results have been reviewed during last 10 years [14]."
[3] "Maximum propene yields up to 25% have been obtained with these materials."
[4] "When using nitrous oxide instead of molecular oxygen as oxidizing agent, propene selectivity was also significantly improved over steam-activated iron-containing zeolites [19], bulk vanadium oxides [20] and supported vanadium-containing materials [13,21-23]."
[5] "However, due to low olefin yields, such reactions are still far from their industrial applications."
[6] "The major drawback is low olefin selectivity, which originates from fast consecutive oxidation of the target olefins to carbon oxides."
[7] "In these studies, it has also been found that the activity of VOx sites for consecutive propene oxidation increases with rising agglomerization degree [14]."
[8] "When the latter species were dominating, not only a dramatic drop of propene selectivity but also direct total oxidation of propane occurred with both oxidants, O2 and N2O, although this detrimental effect was less pronounced in presence of N2O [14]."
[9] "In addition to the above kinetic reasons, a recent steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) study [26] suggested that compared to N2O, other oxygen species (non-lattice oxygen of VOx species) are formed from gas-phase O2 and participate in COx formation."

1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods is achieving high olefin yields and maintaining high olefin selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a promising alternative, providing an environmentally friendly way to convert abundant feedstocks into valuable building blocks for the petrochemical industry. 

2. Over the past decade, significant efforts have been made to enhance catalyst selectivity for ODHP. The best-performing catalysts can achieve up to 25% propene yields.

3. Using nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidizing agent instead of molecular oxygen (O2) has led to a substantial improvement in propene selectivity in ODHP reactions compared to other catalyst systems.

4. Despite these advancements, ODHP reactions are yet to reach industrial application stages due to the inherent low olefin yields and selectivity issues.

5. The low olefin selectivity is mainly attributed to the rapid consecutive oxidation of target olefins to carbon oxides.

6. Researchers have observed that the activity of VOx sites for the consecutive oxidation of propene increases with the agglomerization degree of the catalyst particles.

7. In certain conditions, the use of N2O as an oxidant leads to a less pronounced negative impact on propene selectivity compared to O2.

8. The detrimental effect on propene selectivity is exacerbated when the catalyst contains dominant V2O5 nanocrystallites, which can lead to the total oxidation of propane.

9. A recent SSITKA study indicates that non-lattice oxygen species formed from gas-phase O2 play a role in the formation of COx compounds, suggesting that N2O may influence the selectivity of ODHP differently than O2.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是如何实现高烯烃产率和保持高烯烃选择性。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）提供了一种有吸引力的替代方案，为将廉价且丰富的原料转化为现代石油化工行业的宝贵构建块提供了可能。

2. 过去十年中，对ODHP催化剂选择性的改进取得了显著成果。最佳催化剂可实现高达25%的丙烯产率。

3. 与分子氧相比，使用氮氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的丙烯选择性显著提高，与其他催化剂系统相比具有优势。

4. 尽管取得了这些进展，但ODHP反应仍然难以达到工业应用阶段，原因在于其固有的低烯烃产率和选择性问题。

5. 烯烃选择性低主要归因于目标烯烃快速连续氧化至碳氧化物。

6. 研究表明，随着催化剂颗粒团聚度的增加，VOx位点对丙烯连续氧化的活性也会增加。

7. 在某些情况下，使用N2O作为氧化剂对丙烯选择性的影响比使用O2更小。

8. 当催化剂包含主导的V2O5纳米晶粒时，对丙烯选择性的负面影响会加剧，导致丙烷的完全氧化。

9. 最近的稳定状态同位素瞬态动力学分析（SSITKA）研究表明，来自气相O2的非晶格氧物种参与COx化合物的形成，这表明N2O可能以不同于O2的方式影响ODHP的选择性。
