[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
[4] "Moreover, in that review the set-up of catalytic materials and/or reactor configurations capable of maintaining high selectivity to propylene under conditions leading to high propane conversion was addressed as main direction for future development."
[5] "On such a basis, the attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
[6] "Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the reliance on non-oxidative processes which consume substantial amounts of energy and require complex infrastructure. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency, as it is an exothermic process unlike the endothermic nature of traditional dehydrogenation and cracking methods. Additionally, ODHP simplifies the production process. However, the selection of oxidants presents its own set of challenges. Oxygen, despite enabling the process to become exothermic, leads to over-oxidation of paraffins and olefins into carbon oxides. Using carbon dioxide as an oxidant avoids this issue, but poses its own limitations. For instance, ODHP with carbon dioxide as an oxidant is endothermic, requiring external heat input. Adding oxygen to the carbon dioxide mixture turns the process exothermic, which has potential benefits for catalyst coking. Nonetheless, the choice of oxidant significantly influences the selectivity in propylene production, affecting the yield of olefins such as propene and ethene.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括对非氧化过程的依赖，这些过程消耗大量能量并需要复杂的基础设施。通过提供更高的能效，氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）解决了这些问题，因为它是一个放热过程，而传统脱氢和裂化方法则为吸热过程。此外，ODHP简化了生产过程。然而，在选择氧化剂时会遇到一些挑战。尽管氧气使过程成为放热的，导致饱和烃和烯烃过氧化成碳氧化物，但这对于选择氧化剂具有重要意义。使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂避免了这个问题，但提出了自己的限制。例如，使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂进行ODHP是吸热的，需要外部热量输入。将氧气添加到二氧化碳混合物中将过程变为放热过程，这在催化剂结焦方面有潜在的好处。然而，选择的氧化剂显著影响丙烯的选择性，从而影响丙烯和其他烯烃如乙烯的产量。
