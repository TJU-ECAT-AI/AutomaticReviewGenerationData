[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process)."
[4] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
[5] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[6] "However, in preliminary tests they exhibited a slightly lower catalytic activity than the catalyst with 2.00 wt% Cr content (see Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI), Fig. S1), and then they were not longer considered."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, including steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation, are their reliance on petroleum-based materials and the energy inefficiency of endothermic processes like dehydrogenation and cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency (since ODH is exothermic) and a simpler process flow. It presents advantages such as lower costs and sustainability. However, challenges remain, including the optimization of catalysts to achieve high propene yields and stability under industrially relevant conditions. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP are related to the over-oxidation of both propane and produced olefins, which limits selectivity to olefins. Different oxidants, such as carbon dioxide, are explored to mitigate these issues and improve selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括依赖石油基材料和脱氢裂解等耗能过程的能量效率低。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更高的能量效率（因为ODH是放热的）和更简单的流程流，解决了这些问题，并提供了成本较低和可持续性的优势。然而，仍然存在优化催化剂以实现高丙烯产率和工业相关条件下稳定性的问题。使用氧气作为氧化剂在ODHP中的特定挑战与对丙烷和生成的烯烃的过氧化有关，这限制了烯烃的选择性。不同的氧化剂，如二氧化碳，正在探索以改善选择性和减少这些问题。
