[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
[3] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[4] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[5] "The attainment of high selectivity to olefins via ODH of alkanes is basically limited, from a chemical point of view, by the use of O2 as oxidant, because of the occurrence of the over- oxidation to carbon oxides of both fed paraffins and produced olefins."
[6] "Although ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic process (H298K= + 166.6 kJ/mol), the addition of a small amount of oxygen can turn the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected."
[7] "However, it must be considered that parallel reactions also contributed to C3H8 conversion. Actually,some H2 (< 0.5 mol%) was found among the products when CO2 alone was used as oxidant, likely resulting for the occurrence to some extent of both propane direct dehydrogenation and water gas shift reaction."

1. Current propylene production relies on non-oxidative methods such as steam cracking, fluid-catalytic cracking, and catalytic dehydrogenation. These methods face challenges including high energy consumption and complexity of processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers higher energy efficiency and simplicity, addressing these issues.

2. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP presents challenges due to the risk of over-oxidation, converting paraffins and olefins into carbon oxides. However, adding a small amount of oxygen can make the process exothermic and potentially benefit catalyst coking.

3. The extent of mesopores decreases with increased chromium content, yet this does not hinder the catalyst's performance. The presence of Brnsted acid sites increases with higher chromium loading, contributing to the catalytic activity.

4. The investigated Cr/SiO2 catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation, even after extensive testing. They achieved high propene yields of up to 40% under challenging conditions.

5. The selectivity and yield of olefins in ODHP are fundamentally limited by the use of oxygen as an oxidant. This leads to the formation of carbon oxides, affecting the efficiency of olefin production.

6. Using carbon dioxide as an oxidant in ODHP allows the process to become exothermic, offering additional benefits such as reduced energy input and potential improvements in catalyst longevity.

7. When using carbon dioxide alone as an oxidant, some hydrogen is produced, suggesting that both direct dehydrogenation and water gas shift reactions contribute to the conversion of propane.

1. 目前丙烯生产依赖于蒸汽裂解、流化床催化裂解和催化脱氢等非氧化方法。这些方法面临高能消耗和过程复杂性的挑战。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）提供了更高的能效和更简单的工艺，解决了这些问题。

2. 氧气在ODHP中的使用带来了过氧化的风险，这会将烷烃和烯烃转化为碳氧化物。然而，添加少量氧气可以使过程变为放热的，并可能对催化剂结焦产生积极影响。

3. 随着铬含量的增加，介孔的量减少，但这并没有阻碍催化剂的性能。随着铬负载的增加，表面酸性位点的数量增加，有助于催化活性的提升。

4. 研究的Cr/SiO2催化剂在长时间测试后仍表现出稳定性，甚至在极端条件下实现了高达40%的丙烯产率。

5. 在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂从根本上限制了烯烃的选择性和产量。这会导致碳氧化物的形成，影响烯烃生产的效率。

6. 使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂在ODHP中使过程变为放热的，提供额外的好处，如减少能量输入和催化剂寿命的潜在改善。

7. 当仅使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂时，会生成一些氢气，表明直接脱氢和水煤气转换反应都参与了丙烷的转化。
