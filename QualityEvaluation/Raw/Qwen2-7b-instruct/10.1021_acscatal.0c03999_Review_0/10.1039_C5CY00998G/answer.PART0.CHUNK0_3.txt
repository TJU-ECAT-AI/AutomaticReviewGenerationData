[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future.1 At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.2 As far as the catalytic dehydrogenation is concerned,commercial processes use Cr2O3/Al2O3 (18-20 Cr wt%; Catofin press) or Pt(<1 wt%),Sn (1-2 wt%)/Al2O3 (Oleflex process).3"

[2] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."

[3] "However, the coincidence between the behaviour exhibited by each catalyst in the first (open symbols) and subsequent (full symbols) 5-8 runs, is a clear evidence that no irreversible deactivation occurred. In fact,  DR UV-Vis-NIR spectra of catalysts after the first run and then treated in flowing O2 at 873 K appeared almost coincident (and then not shown) to those recorded for the fresh form (Fig. S3 in the ESI)"

[4] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred,independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."

[5] "Moreover, such initial YC3H6 corresponded to those obtained by Chen et al. for GaOx based materials,4 and by Ovsitser et al. for VOx supported catalysts.6 In addition, we confirmed the repeatability of these performances over several reaction runs."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, reliance on non-renewable resources, and the complexity of processes like steam cracking and fluid-catalytic cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency due to its exothermic nature, and process simplicity. However, the choice of oxidant, especially oxygen, presents challenges. Oxygen can lead to over-oxidation of both the feed paraffins and the produced olefins, which can reduce selectivity. The use of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a milder oxidant can mitigate this issue, allowing for high propene yields. Despite this, the stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions is crucial to maintain high propene yields over time.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、对不可再生资源的依赖以及蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解等过程的复杂性。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更高的能量效率（由于其放热性质）和简化的过程来解决这些问题。然而，选择氧化剂，尤其是氧气，带来了挑战。氧气可能导致原料烷烃和生成的烯烃过度氧化，从而降低选择性。使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为较温和的氧化剂可以缓解这一问题，允许实现较高的丙烯产率。尽管如此，催化剂在反应条件下的稳定性对于保持长时间的高丙烯产率至关重要。
