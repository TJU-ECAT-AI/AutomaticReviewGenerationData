[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "At present, its industrial production is based on non-oxidative processing of petroleum-based materials, via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic- cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation."
[3] "Possible replacements with lower costs and sustainable alternatives is attracting a rising interest since many years, and the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane appeared among the most promising, because of the higher energy efficiency (ODH is exothermic, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermic processes), and process simplicity."
[4] "Catalytic testing of a series of Cr/SiO2 materials prepared by DHS (Cr loadings in the 0.25 - 2.00 wt% range) targeting ODH conditions (using both CO2 and a CO2+O2 mixture as oxidants) as closest as possible to industrial applications."
[5] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[6] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[7] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."
[8] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred,independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."
[9] "Of course, the switch from direct to oxidative propane dehydrogenation was expected to affect also the formation of coke."
[10] "Yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment), and remained as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy consumption and complexity of processes like steam cracking and fluid-catalytic cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher energy efficiency, as the process is exothermic rather than endothermic, and by simplifying the process. ODHP presents advantages in producing propylene from propane with less energy input and potentially lower costs.

2. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP poses challenges related to the over-oxidation of both the fed paraffins and produced olefins, which limits the selectivity to olefins. However, using carbon dioxide as the oxidant turns the process towards an exothermic character, and additional positive effects towards the catalyst coking might be expected. This makes carbon dioxide a promising mild oxidant for ODHP.

3. The chromium content and the type of oxidant used in the catalysts significantly influence the selectivity and yield in propene. Chromium species in the +2 oxidation state appear to lead to better selectivity for propene production compared to those in the +3 oxidation state, especially when oxygen is used as the oxidant. The difference in oxidation state of chromium sites contributes to the differences in selectivity and yield in propene and ethene in ODHP processes.

4. The chromium/silica catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis exhibit stable catalytic performance under demanding reaction conditions, allowing for the attainment of high propene yields (up to 40%) in the presence of carbon dioxide as the oxidant. The catalysts remain active for over 1000 minutes at a low space velocity, which is suitable for industrial applications. The catalysts also show a linear relationship between the amount of surface sites (Lewis and Brnsted acid) and chromium loading, indicating the role of chromium in promoting the catalytic activity.

5. The DHS method enables the preparation of chromium/silica catalysts with high specific surface area and a texture characterized by the co-presence of ordered mesoporous, disordered mesoporous, and non-porous particles. The relative amount of these particle types depends on the chromium content. However, the presence of mesoporous structure is not a requirement for highly active catalysts.

6. The chromium content affects the stability of the catalysts towards irreversible deactivation during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Higher chromium content leads to a higher amount of Brnsted acid sites, which can promote the transformation of produced olefins into carbonaceous species, leading to reversible deactivation. However, the catalysts prepared in this study remain stable over multiple reaction runs, even under conditions with high propane conversion.

7. The chromium species found in the catalysts are primarily surface chromates, accompanied by Brnsted acid centres. The formation of these species is influenced by the type of oxidant used in the reaction. Oxygen usage results in chromium species in the +3 oxidation state, while carbon dioxide usage leads to chromium species in the +2 oxidation state. This difference in oxidation state may explain the observed differences in selectivity and yield in propene and ethene.

1. 目前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解、流化床催化裂解等过程的能量消耗高和复杂性。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更高的能效（过程为放热而非吸热），以及简化生产流程，解决了这些挑战。ODHP以较低的能量输入和潜在更低的成本从丙烷中生产丙烯。

2. 在使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP过程中，存在的主要挑战是过氧化，这会限制烯烃的选择性。然而，使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂将过程转变为放热性质，并可能对催化剂结焦产生额外的积极影响。因此，二氧化碳成为ODHP中一种有前景的温和氧化剂。

3. 铬含量和所使用的氧化剂类型在催化剂中显著影响选择性和丙烯产率。在+2氧化状态的铬物种似乎导致更好的丙烯选择性，尤其是当使用氧气作为氧化剂时。铬物种的氧化状态差异解释了在ODHP过程中丙烯和乙烯产率之间的差异。

4. 通过直接水热合成方法制备的铬/二氧化硅催化剂显示出在苛刻反应条件下的稳定催化性能，允许在二氧化碳作为氧化剂的情况下达到高达40%的高丙烯产率。即使在低空间速度下，催化剂也能保持活性长达1000分钟，适合工业应用。催化剂还显示出表面酸中心（Lewis和Brnsted）的数量与铬负载之间存在线性关系，表明铬在促进催化活性中的作用。

5. 水热合成方法使制备具有高比表面积和包含有序介孔、无序介孔和非孔颗粒的纹理的铬/二氧化硅催化剂成为可能。这些颗粒类型的相对数量取决于铬含量。然而，介孔结构并非活性催化剂的必要条件。

6. 铬含量影响催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的不可逆失活稳定性。较高铬含量导致更多Brnsted酸位点，这可以促进生成的烯烃转化为碳质物种，导致可逆失活。然而，本研究中制备的催化剂在多个反应循环后仍保持稳定，即使在高丙烷转化率条件下也是如此。

7. 催化剂中发现的铬物种主要是表面铬酸盐，伴有Brnsted酸中心。这些物种的形成受到所用氧化剂类型的影响。使用氧气会导致铬物种处于+3氧化状态，而使用二氧化碳则导致铬物种处于+2氧化状态。这种氧化状态的差异可能解释了丙烯和乙烯产率之间的观察到的选择性差异。
