1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods involve substantial energy use, significant upfront costs, and environmental impact. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more efficient way to produce propylene with reduced energy consumption and capital investment. However, selecting the right oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it impacts the reaction's effectiveness and product selectivity. Using pure oxygen as an oxidant poses challenges due to its high cost and safety concerns. Nitrous oxide, being a less expensive and safer option, has been studied as an alternative in ODHP. In this research, a Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized through grafting and employed for the ODHP process using nitrous oxide.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高初始投资和环境问题。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）提供了一种更高效的方法来生产丙烯，具有较低的能量消耗和投资成本。然而，在ODHP中选择合适的氧化剂至关重要，因为它影响反应的效率和产物的选择性。纯氧气作为氧化剂存在挑战，主要是由于其高昂的成本和安全问题。相比之下，由于成本较低且安全性更好，已将一氧化二氮作为一种替代选项在ODHP中进行研究。在本研究中，通过接枝法制备了Fe-ZSM-5催化剂，并用于使用一氧化二氮的ODHP过程。
