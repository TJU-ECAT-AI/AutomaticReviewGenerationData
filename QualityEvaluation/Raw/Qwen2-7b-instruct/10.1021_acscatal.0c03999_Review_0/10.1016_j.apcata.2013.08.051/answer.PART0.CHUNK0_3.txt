1. Current propylene production methods face challenges such as high energy consumption and costly catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by employing a more energy-efficient process and possibly less expensive catalysts. However, ODHP has its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning oxidant selection. Nitrous oxide was selected as the oxidant in this study because of its availability, low cost, and environmental benefits. Oxygen's usage as an oxidant poses challenges including higher energy consumption and potential environmental concerns.

2. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared through grafting, was utilized as the catalyst in the ODHP process. Catalyst characterization demonstrated its effective performance in converting propane to propylene. The performance assessment revealed that using nitrous oxide as an oxidant in the ODHP process with Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst resulted in enhanced propylene yields.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临的挑战包括高能耗和催化剂成本高。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过采用更节能的过程和可能成本更低的催化剂来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP有自己的优势和限制，尤其是在选择氧化剂的背景下。在本研究中，选择了氮氧化物作为氧化剂，因为它具有可用性、低成本和环境效益。氧气作为氧化剂的使用带来了更高的能耗和潜在的环境问题等挑战。

2. 通过接枝制备的Fe-ZSM-5被用作ODHP过程中的催化剂。催化剂表征显示其在将丙烷转化为丙烯方面的有效性能。性能评估表明，在使用Fe-ZSM-5催化剂的ODHP过程中使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂导致了丙烯产量的提高。
