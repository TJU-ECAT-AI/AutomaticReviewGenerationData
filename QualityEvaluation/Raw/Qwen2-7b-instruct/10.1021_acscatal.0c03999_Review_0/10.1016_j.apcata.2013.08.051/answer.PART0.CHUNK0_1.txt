1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, low selectivity, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher propylene yield, lower energy consumption, and the potential for using renewable oxidants. However, the selection of oxidant is crucial, with oxygen commonly used but having limitations due to high energy consumption and environmental impact. Alternative oxidants, such as nitrous oxide, are explored to overcome these limitations.
2. Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, prepared through grafting, demonstrate promise in enhancing the performance of ODHP processes.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、低选择性和环境问题。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更高的丙烯产率、更低的能耗以及潜在的使用可再生氧化剂，解决了这些问题。然而，氧化剂的选择至关重要，氧气通常被使用，但存在由于高能耗和环境影响的限制。正在探索替代氧化剂，如硝酸氧化物，以克服这些限制。
2. 通过接枝制备的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂，在增强ODHP过程性能方面显示出潜力。
