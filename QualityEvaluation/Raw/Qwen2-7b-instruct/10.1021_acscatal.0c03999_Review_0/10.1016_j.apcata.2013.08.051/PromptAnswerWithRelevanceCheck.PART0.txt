1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods involve substantial energy use, significant upfront costs, and environmental impact. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more efficient way to produce propylene with reduced energy consumption and capital investment. However, selecting the right oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as it impacts the reaction's effectiveness and product selectivity. Using pure oxygen as an oxidant poses challenges due to its high cost and safety concerns. Nitrous oxide, being a less expensive and safer option, has been studied as an alternative in ODHP. In this research, a Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst was synthesized through grafting and employed for the ODHP process using nitrous oxide.
