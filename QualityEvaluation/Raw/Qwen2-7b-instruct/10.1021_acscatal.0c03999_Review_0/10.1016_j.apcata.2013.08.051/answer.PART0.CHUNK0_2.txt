The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include energy-intensive processes, specifically steam cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient approach. However, selecting nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant introduces its own set of challenges. While N2O can lead to lower energy consumption and reduced emissions compared to pure oxygen, its decomposition during the reaction and potential formation of nitrogen oxides can affect the catalyst's stability and product quality.
