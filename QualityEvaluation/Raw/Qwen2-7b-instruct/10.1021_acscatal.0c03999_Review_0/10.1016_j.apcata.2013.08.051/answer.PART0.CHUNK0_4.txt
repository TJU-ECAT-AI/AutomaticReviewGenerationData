1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and environmental pollution. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more energy-efficient process. Using nitrous oxide as an oxidant in ODHP can enhance the selectivity and yield of propylene. Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts prepared through grafting have been studied for their effectiveness in ODHP reactions. Yet, employing oxygen as an oxidant presents specific challenges, such as its high cost and safety concerns.
