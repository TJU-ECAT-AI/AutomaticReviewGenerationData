The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the high temperatures and low pressures required for dehydrogenation, which favor thermal cracking reactions leading to coke and light alkanes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by performing the process at relatively low temperatures, with high selectivity to propene, utilizing carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The use of carbon dioxide in ODHP allows for a more efficient and environmentally friendly production of propene compared to traditional methods. The main limitation lies in selecting a catalyst with desirable selectivity, as seen with chromium oxide catalysts and gallium oxide. Gallium oxide has proven effective in dehydrogenating propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢过程需要的高温和低压，这有利于热裂解反应导致焦炭和轻烷烃。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过在较低温度下进行并保持高丙烯选择性来解决这些问题，利用二氧化碳作为氧化剂。使用二氧化碳在ODHP中允许更高效、更环保地生产丙烯，与传统方法相比。主要限制在于选择具有高选择性的催化剂，如铬氧化物催化剂和镓氧化物。镓氧化物已被证明在二氧化碳存在的条件下有效脱氢丙烷生成丙烯，提供了一个有前景的替代传统方法的替代方案。
