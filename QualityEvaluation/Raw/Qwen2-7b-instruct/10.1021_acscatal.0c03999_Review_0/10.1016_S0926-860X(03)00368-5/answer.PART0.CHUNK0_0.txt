1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the requirement for high temperatures and low pressures to achieve good yields of alkenes, which often favor thermal cracking reactions leading to the formation of coke and lighter alkanes. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially allowing the dehydrogenation process to occur at relatively lower temperatures compared to thermal cracking, thus reducing the risk of overoxidation and the formation of unwanted byproducts.

2. The advantages of ODHP include the potential for performing the dehydrogenation process at lower temperatures, which reduces energy consumption, and the possibility of using CO2 as a mild oxidant instead of oxygen, thereby lowering the risk of overoxidation. However, the process presents its own set of challenges, such as the need to develop selective catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propene without excessive byproduct formation. Additionally, the choice of oxidant, whether oxygen or CO2, impacts the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

Answer: 
1. 现有丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括为了获得良好的烯烃产率，需要高温和低压，这往往有利于热裂解反应产生焦炭和轻烷烃。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过可能允许在比热裂解更低的温度下进行脱氢过程，从而降低过氧化和副产品形成的潜在风险来解决这些问题。

2. ODHP的优势包括可能在较低温度下进行脱氢过程，从而减少能耗，并有可能使用二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂而不是氧气，从而降低过氧化的风险。然而，该过程存在自己的挑战，如需要开发高效选择性催化剂，以有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而不会形成过多的副产品。此外，选择氧化剂（无论是氧气还是二氧化碳），都会影响过程的效率和选择性。
