1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods include the need for high temperatures and low pressures, which can lead to non-selective reactions favoring the formation of coke and lighter alkanes. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing the dehydrogenation to occur at relatively lower temperatures with high selectivity towards propene, thanks to the use of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, such as the selection of an appropriate oxidant and managing the risk of over-oxidation leading to the formation of carbon oxides and oxygenates, which reduces the selectivity towards propene.

2. In the context of oxidant selection, carbon dioxide (CO2) is chosen as a mild oxidant in ODHP because it enables the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity. This is advantageous compared to using pure oxygen, which is exothermic and requires heat removal to prevent over-oxidation and the formation of undesired products. The potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts, however, show a decrease in activity, suggesting that the reaction might proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, which are blocked by excess potassium.

3. The use of potassium in the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity. This is likely due to the blocking of active sites for dehydrogenation by excess potassium, which may be the acidic sites of the catalyst involved in the dehydrogenation process. The potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity, possibly indicating that they do not efficiently utilize the acidic sites for the desired reaction.

4. The results lead to conclusions about the effectiveness of bulk gallium oxide for dehydrogenating propane to propene, the limited role of carbon dioxide in enhancing the initial activity of the catalyst, and the detrimental effects of potassium on the catalyst's activity. The reaction is believed to occur on acidic sites of the catalyst, which are negatively impacted by the presence of excess potassium.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括需要高温和低压，这可能导致非选择性反应，促进焦炭和轻烷烃的形成。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过利用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂，在较低温度下实现高选择性丙烯生成，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，例如选择合适的氧化剂和管理过氧化的风险，这可能导致二氧化碳氧化物和氧化物的形成，从而降低丙烯的选择性。

2. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，二氧化碳（CO2）被选作ODHP中的温和氧化剂，因为它允许在较低温度下进行丙烷脱氢，同时保持高丙烯选择性。这与使用纯氧相比具有优势，后者是放热的，并且需要去除热量以防止过氧化和形成不需要的产品。钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂的活性下降，表明反应可能在催化剂上的酸性位点上进行，这些位点可能被过多的钾阻塞，从而导致催化剂活性下降。

3. 钾在镓氧化物催化剂中的使用导致催化活性的损失。这可能是由于过多的钾阻塞了用于脱氢的活性位点，这些位点可能是催化剂中的酸性位点，参与所需反应过程。钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂没有显示出高活性，这可能表明它们没有有效地利用酸性位点进行所需反应。

4. 结论指出了纯镓氧化物对丙烷脱氢到丙烯的有效性，二氧化碳在初始阶段增强催化剂活性的作用有限，以及钾对催化剂活性的不利影响。反应被认为在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这些位点在存在过多钾的情况下受到负面影响。
