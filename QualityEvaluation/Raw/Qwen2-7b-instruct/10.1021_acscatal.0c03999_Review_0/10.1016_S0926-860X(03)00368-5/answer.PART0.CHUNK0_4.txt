<p>It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas.</p>
<p>The key problem is the development of a new catalyst with desirable selectivity. Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They reported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective.

<p>The dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Ga2O3 in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide were investigated under similar conditions. Fig. 1 presents the catalytic performance in both processes as a function of the reaction time.</p>
<p>In the absence of O2, the selectivity is the highest. Increase of O2 concentration up to 9.1% weakly decrease propane conversion and propene yield.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve obtaining high yields of propene at low temperatures while minimizing the formation of byproducts such as methane and ethylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by performing the reaction at relatively low temperatures, which reduces the formation of byproducts. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, including the need for an effective oxidant that avoids overoxidation and the requirement for selective catalysts that can prevent the formation of unwanted compounds. The choice of oxidant, such as oxygen or carbon dioxide, affects the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

2. The promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane is observed only in the initial stages of the reaction. Despite enhancing the initial activity of the gallium oxide catalyst, carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction might occur on acidic sites of the catalyst.

3. The effectiveness of different catalysts, such as supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3/SiO2) and gallium oxide (Ga2O3), in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide varies. Chromium oxide catalysts show excellent performance, while gallium oxide catalysts exhibit a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of propane when used in the presence of carbon dioxide. Ethylene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide is approximately twice that in its absence, indicating the potential benefits of using this approach.

4. Thermodynamic considerations predict that the dehydrogenation of propane can be improved by coupling it with the water-gas shift reaction, which consumes hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation process and shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of propene. This can potentially lower the temperature required for the dehydrogenation process.

5. The introduction of hydrogen or propane pulses prior to the reaction with the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a reduction in the amount of carbon monoxide on the catalyst surface. This suggests that carbon dioxide can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the gallium oxide surface, possibly through a redox cycle involving the formation and reoxidation of carbon monoxide. Alternatively, it may act as a mild oxidant, facilitating the removal of carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction.

6. XRD analyses of the gallium oxide catalysts reveal that the major phase is the stable form of gallium oxide (-Ga2O3). The presence of potassium in the catalyst leads to the detection of potassium carbonate (K2CO3). No significant changes in the diffraction patterns are observed between the catalyst before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under a carbon dioxide flow. However, the fresh gallium oxide catalyst is more amorphous than that after the reaction.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在较低温度下获得高丙烯产率的同时，尽量减少甲烷和乙烯等副产品的生成。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过在相对较低的温度下进行反应来解决这些问题，从而减少了副产品的形成。然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列优势和限制，包括需要有效避免过氧化的氧化剂选择以及需要具有选择性的催化剂来防止形成不需要的化合物。所选氧化剂，如氧气或二氧化碳，对过程的效率和选择性有影响。

2. 二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢中的促进作用仅在反应初期观察到。尽管增强了镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性，但二氧化碳并不能抑制催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致催化活性降低，这表明反应可能发生在催化剂上的酸性位点上。

3. 不同催化剂，如支持铬氧化物（Cr2O3/SiO2）和镓氧化物（Ga2O3），在使用二氧化碳进行乙烷氧化脱氢时表现出不同的效果。铬氧化物催化剂显示出出色的性能，而镓氧化物催化剂在使用二氧化碳时对丙烷脱氢表现出促进作用。在存在二氧化碳的情况下，乙烷的乙烯产率大约是其不存在时的两倍，这表明采用这种方法的潜在益处。

4. 热力学考虑预测，通过将丙烷脱氢与水气转移反应耦合，可以提高丙烷的脱氢效率。该过程消耗在脱氢过程中产生的氢，并使平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。这可能有助于降低脱氢过程所需的温度。

5. 在向镓氧化物催化剂引入氢或丙烷脉冲之前，进行的反应导致催化剂表面碳一氧化物的含量减少。这表明二氧化碳可以与吸附在镓氧化物表面的氢发生反应，可能涉及碳一氧化物的形成和再氧化的红ox循环。或者，它可能作为温和的氧化剂，通过布杜瓦德反应促进碳沉积的去除。

6. 催化剂的X射线衍射分析显示，主要相是已知稳定的镓氧化物形式。在含有钾的催化剂中检测到了碳酸钾（K2CO3）。在二氧化碳流动下进行的丙烷脱氢前后，衍射图案没有显著变化。然而，新鲜的镓氧化物催化剂比反应后更无定形。
