[2] "Propene is used in chemical industry for the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile and high purity polypropylene."

[7] "However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 over gallium oxide."
[8] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include nonselectivity due to the equal chance of CH bonds reacting, high temperatures favoring thermal cracking, and the requirement for strong oxidants like oxygen that can lead to overoxidation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially performing the reaction at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity, especially when using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Carbon dioxide acts as a mild oxidant, enabling selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The use of potassium in gallium oxide catalysts reduces the catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. The promoting role of carbon dioxide is limited to the initial stage of the reaction and does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括非选择性，因为所有等效的CH键都有相同的反应机会，高温有利于热裂解反应产生焦油和轻烷烃，以及对强氧化剂（如氧气）的需求可能导致过氧化。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过有可能在相对较低温度下以高选择性进行反应来解决这些问题，特别是当使用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂时。然而，ODHP也存在自己的优势和限制。二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂的作用，使选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯成为可能。在镓氧化物催化剂中加入钾会降低催化活性，这表明反应很可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。二氧化碳促进作用仅限于反应的初始阶段，并不能防止催化剂的快速失活。
