1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the requirement for high temperatures and low pressures to achieve good yields of alkenes, which often favor thermal cracking reactions leading to the formation of coke and lighter alkanes. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially allowing the dehydrogenation process to occur at relatively lower temperatures compared to thermal cracking, thus reducing the risk of overoxidation and the formation of unwanted byproducts.

2. The advantages of ODHP include the potential for performing the dehydrogenation process at lower temperatures, which reduces energy consumption, and the possibility of using CO2 as a mild oxidant instead of oxygen, thereby lowering the risk of overoxidation. However, the process presents its own set of challenges, such as the need to develop selective catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propene without excessive byproduct formation. Additionally, the choice of oxidant, whether oxygen or CO2, impacts the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

Answer: 
1. 现有丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括为了获得良好的烯烃产率，需要高温和低压，这往往有利于热裂解反应产生焦炭和轻烷烃。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过可能允许在比热裂解更低的温度下进行脱氢过程，从而降低过氧化和副产品形成的潜在风险来解决这些问题。

2. ODHP的优势包括可能在较低温度下进行脱氢过程，从而减少能耗，并有可能使用二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂而不是氧气，从而降低过氧化的风险。然而，该过程存在自己的挑战，如需要开发高效选择性催化剂，以有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，而不会形成过多的副产品。此外，选择氧化剂（无论是氧气还是二氧化碳），都会影响过程的效率和选择性。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the high temperatures and low pressures required for dehydrogenation, which favor thermal cracking reactions leading to coke and light alkanes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by performing the process at relatively low temperatures, with high selectivity to propene, utilizing carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The use of carbon dioxide in ODHP allows for a more efficient and environmentally friendly production of propene compared to traditional methods. The main limitation lies in selecting a catalyst with desirable selectivity, as seen with chromium oxide catalysts and gallium oxide. Gallium oxide has proven effective in dehydrogenating propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是脱氢过程需要的高温和低压，这有利于热裂解反应导致焦炭和轻烷烃。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过在较低温度下进行并保持高丙烯选择性来解决这些问题，利用二氧化碳作为氧化剂。使用二氧化碳在ODHP中允许更高效、更环保地生产丙烯，与传统方法相比。主要限制在于选择具有高选择性的催化剂，如铬氧化物催化剂和镓氧化物。镓氧化物已被证明在二氧化碳存在的条件下有效脱氢丙烷生成丙烯，提供了一个有前景的替代传统方法的替代方案。

1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods include the need for high temperatures and low pressures, which can lead to non-selective reactions favoring the formation of coke and lighter alkanes. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing the dehydrogenation to occur at relatively lower temperatures with high selectivity towards propene, thanks to the use of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, such as the selection of an appropriate oxidant and managing the risk of over-oxidation leading to the formation of carbon oxides and oxygenates, which reduces the selectivity towards propene.

2. In the context of oxidant selection, carbon dioxide (CO2) is chosen as a mild oxidant in ODHP because it enables the dehydrogenation of propane to propene at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity. This is advantageous compared to using pure oxygen, which is exothermic and requires heat removal to prevent over-oxidation and the formation of undesired products. The potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts, however, show a decrease in activity, suggesting that the reaction might proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, which are blocked by excess potassium.

3. The use of potassium in the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity. This is likely due to the blocking of active sites for dehydrogenation by excess potassium, which may be the acidic sites of the catalyst involved in the dehydrogenation process. The potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity, possibly indicating that they do not efficiently utilize the acidic sites for the desired reaction.

4. The results lead to conclusions about the effectiveness of bulk gallium oxide for dehydrogenating propane to propene, the limited role of carbon dioxide in enhancing the initial activity of the catalyst, and the detrimental effects of potassium on the catalyst's activity. The reaction is believed to occur on acidic sites of the catalyst, which are negatively impacted by the presence of excess potassium.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括需要高温和低压，这可能导致非选择性反应，促进焦炭和轻烷烃的形成。丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过利用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂，在较低温度下实现高选择性丙烯生成，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列挑战，例如选择合适的氧化剂和管理过氧化的风险，这可能导致二氧化碳氧化物和氧化物的形成，从而降低丙烯的选择性。

2. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，二氧化碳（CO2）被选作ODHP中的温和氧化剂，因为它允许在较低温度下进行丙烷脱氢，同时保持高丙烯选择性。这与使用纯氧相比具有优势，后者是放热的，并且需要去除热量以防止过氧化和形成不需要的产品。钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂的活性下降，表明反应可能在催化剂上的酸性位点上进行，这些位点可能被过多的钾阻塞，从而导致催化剂活性下降。

3. 钾在镓氧化物催化剂中的使用导致催化活性的损失。这可能是由于过多的钾阻塞了用于脱氢的活性位点，这些位点可能是催化剂中的酸性位点，参与所需反应过程。钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂没有显示出高活性，这可能表明它们没有有效地利用酸性位点进行所需反应。

4. 结论指出了纯镓氧化物对丙烷脱氢到丙烯的有效性，二氧化碳在初始阶段增强催化剂活性的作用有限，以及钾对催化剂活性的不利影响。反应被认为在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这些位点在存在过多钾的情况下受到负面影响。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include nonselectivity due to the equal chance of CH bonds reacting, high temperatures favoring thermal cracking, and the requirement for strong oxidants like oxygen that can lead to overoxidation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially performing the reaction at relatively low temperatures with high selectivity, especially when using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Carbon dioxide acts as a mild oxidant, enabling selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The use of potassium in gallium oxide catalysts reduces the catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. The promoting role of carbon dioxide is limited to the initial stage of the reaction and does not prevent the fast deactivation of the catalyst.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括非选择性，因为所有等效的CH键都有相同的反应机会，高温有利于热裂解反应产生焦油和轻烷烃，以及对强氧化剂（如氧气）的需求可能导致过氧化。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过有可能在相对较低温度下以高选择性进行反应来解决这些问题，特别是当使用二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂时。然而，ODHP也存在自己的优势和限制。二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂的作用，使选择性脱氢丙烷为丙烯成为可能。在镓氧化物催化剂中加入钾会降低催化活性，这表明反应很可能在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。二氧化碳促进作用仅限于反应的初始阶段，并不能防止催化剂的快速失活。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve obtaining high yields of propene at low temperatures while minimizing the formation of byproducts such as methane and ethylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by performing the reaction at relatively low temperatures, which reduces the formation of byproducts. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, including the need for an effective oxidant that avoids overoxidation and the requirement for selective catalysts that can prevent the formation of unwanted compounds. The choice of oxidant, such as oxygen or carbon dioxide, affects the efficiency and selectivity of the process.

2. The promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane is observed only in the initial stages of the reaction. Despite enhancing the initial activity of the gallium oxide catalyst, carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction might occur on acidic sites of the catalyst.

3. The effectiveness of different catalysts, such as supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3/SiO2) and gallium oxide (Ga2O3), in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide varies. Chromium oxide catalysts show excellent performance, while gallium oxide catalysts exhibit a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of propane when used in the presence of carbon dioxide. Ethylene yield in the presence of carbon dioxide is approximately twice that in its absence, indicating the potential benefits of using this approach.

4. Thermodynamic considerations predict that the dehydrogenation of propane can be improved by coupling it with the water-gas shift reaction, which consumes hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation process and shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of propene. This can potentially lower the temperature required for the dehydrogenation process.

5. The introduction of hydrogen or propane pulses prior to the reaction with the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a reduction in the amount of carbon monoxide on the catalyst surface. This suggests that carbon dioxide can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the gallium oxide surface, possibly through a redox cycle involving the formation and reoxidation of carbon monoxide. Alternatively, it may act as a mild oxidant, facilitating the removal of carbon deposits through the Boudouard reaction.

6. XRD analyses of the gallium oxide catalysts reveal that the major phase is the stable form of gallium oxide (-Ga2O3). The presence of potassium in the catalyst leads to the detection of potassium carbonate (K2CO3). No significant changes in the diffraction patterns are observed between the catalyst before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under a carbon dioxide flow. However, the fresh gallium oxide catalyst is more amorphous than that after the reaction.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在较低温度下获得高丙烯产率的同时，尽量减少甲烷和乙烯等副产品的生成。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过在相对较低的温度下进行反应来解决这些问题，从而减少了副产品的形成。然而，ODHP也存在自身的一系列优势和限制，包括需要有效避免过氧化的氧化剂选择以及需要具有选择性的催化剂来防止形成不需要的化合物。所选氧化剂，如氧气或二氧化碳，对过程的效率和选择性有影响。

2. 二氧化碳在丙烷脱氢中的促进作用仅在反应初期观察到。尽管增强了镓氧化物催化剂的初始活性，但二氧化碳并不能抑制催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致催化活性降低，这表明反应可能发生在催化剂上的酸性位点上。

3. 不同催化剂，如支持铬氧化物（Cr2O3/SiO2）和镓氧化物（Ga2O3），在使用二氧化碳进行乙烷氧化脱氢时表现出不同的效果。铬氧化物催化剂显示出出色的性能，而镓氧化物催化剂在使用二氧化碳时对丙烷脱氢表现出促进作用。在存在二氧化碳的情况下，乙烷的乙烯产率大约是其不存在时的两倍，这表明采用这种方法的潜在益处。

4. 热力学考虑预测，通过将丙烷脱氢与水气转移反应耦合，可以提高丙烷的脱氢效率。该过程消耗在脱氢过程中产生的氢，并使平衡向丙烯形成的方向移动。这可能有助于降低脱氢过程所需的温度。

5. 在向镓氧化物催化剂引入氢或丙烷脉冲之前，进行的反应导致催化剂表面碳一氧化物的含量减少。这表明二氧化碳可以与吸附在镓氧化物表面的氢发生反应，可能涉及碳一氧化物的形成和再氧化的红ox循环。或者，它可能作为温和的氧化剂，通过布杜瓦德反应促进碳沉积的去除。

6. 催化剂的X射线衍射分析显示，主要相是已知稳定的镓氧化物形式。在含有钾的催化剂中检测到了碳酸钾（K2CO3）。在二氧化碳流动下进行的丙烷脱氢前后，衍射图案没有显著变化。然而，新鲜的镓氧化物催化剂比反应后更无定形。
