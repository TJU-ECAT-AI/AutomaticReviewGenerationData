The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, potential environmental impacts, and the need for specialized catalysts that may limit the process's versatility. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method. By using hydrogen sulphide as a promoter, ODHP can achieve high yields of C4 olefins, including propylene, under milder conditions compared to traditional methods. This approach is advantageous because it can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, reducing the risk of feed degradation through cracking or burning. However, the choice of oxidant, particularly in selecting between oxygen and air, introduces complexities related to product analysis and potential product separation challenges. The use of molten salts as a reaction medium helps manage the heat generated during the reaction, preventing localized overheating and degradation of the feedstock. The LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 system specifically demonstrates broad applicability across various dehydrogenation reactions, showcasing the potential for a universal catalyst solution. This system's effectiveness in multiple reactions suggests a significant advantage over solid heterogeneous catalysts, which often require specific catalysts tailored to each reactant.
