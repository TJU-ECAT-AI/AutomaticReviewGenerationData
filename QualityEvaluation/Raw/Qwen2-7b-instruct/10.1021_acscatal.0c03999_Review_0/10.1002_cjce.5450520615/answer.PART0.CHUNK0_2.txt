[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."
[2] "Optimization of reaction conditions by varying temperature, space velocity and quantity of promoter results in a 53% olefin yield (5% butenes, 48% butadiene) at 80% butane conversion."
[3] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."
[4] "Experiments were carried out to utilize molten salts as media for the sulphur promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane."
[5] "The system is also shown to be efficient for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."
[6] "The best melts from the screening program - LiCl/KCl alone and promoted with MnCl2 and BaCl2 - were therefore tested at this higher H2S level with the results shown in Table 5."
[7] "It was shown that this system was effective in each of these reactions and product yields were as good or better than results obtained on using solid catalysts."
[8] "The reasons for the promotional and catalytic activity of added manganese chloride and other soluble salts are not understood but it is interesting to note that a recent publication by workers at Monsanto found that for pure oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, a mixture of LiCl/KCl + MnCl2 supported on a low surface area alumina was the best catalyst."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, environmental concerns due to potential emissions, and the complexity of achieving high yields from saturated feedstocks. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. This process utilizes hydrogen sulphide as a promoter, enabling the conversion of propane to propylene with high yields. The use of molten salts as a reaction medium helps in dissipating heat effectively, preventing the formation of hot spots that could degrade the feed and products. The promotion by hydrogen sulphide allows for the utilization of mild conditions, which are more sustainable compared to traditional methods. However, the selection of the oxidant, particularly between oxygen and air, presents a challenge. Oxygen provides a more direct and efficient oxidation pathway, whereas air introduces additional complications due to the presence of nitrogen, which can mask the results in the analysis. Despite these challenges, ODHP offers significant advantages over conventional methods, including higher yields, lower energy consumption, and reduced environmental impact. The specific benefits and limitations of ODHP are influenced by factors such as the choice of reactants, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the selection of appropriate catalysts or promoters.
