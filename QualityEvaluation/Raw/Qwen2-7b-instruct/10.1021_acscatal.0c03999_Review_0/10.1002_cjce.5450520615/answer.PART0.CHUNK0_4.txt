[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons promoted by hydrogen sulphide has been shown to be an efficient process for the manufacture of olefins and diolefins from the corresponding more saturated feedstocks."
[2] "Optimization of reaction conditions by varying temperature, space velocity and quantity of promoter results in a 53% olefin yield (5% butenes, 48% butadiene) at 80% butane conversion."
[3] "The system is also shown to be efficient for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."
[4] "In the case of butene or ethylbenzene, dehydrogenation is achieved at relatively mild conditions of temperature, i.e. 1000-1200F (640-650C)."
[5] "For higher paraffins such as butane, high temperatures cause cracking and burning of the feed and no catalysts have been found to permit the sulphur promoted reaction to proceed efficiently."
[6] "Experiments were carried out to utilize molten salts as media for the sulphur promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane."
[7] "It was thought that the excellent heat transfer properties of molten salts would result in rapid dissipation of reaction heat and prevent the formation of hot spots which cause feed and product degradation."
[8] "Furthermore, judicious selection of the salts could result in the development of a molten catalyst system for the hydrogen sulphide promoted dehydrogenation reaction."
[9] "This paper describes the experimental program to develop suitable molten systems for the dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene, the optimization of these systems and their application to other feedstocks such as ethane, propane, butene and ethylbenzene."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high temperatures leading to cracking and burning of feed, especially with higher paraffins like butane. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing mild temperature conditions for dehydrogenation of butene or ethylbenzene (around 1000-1200F or 640-650C) and using molten salts to efficiently dissipate reaction heat, preventing degradation of feed and products. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges related to oxidant selection and potential side reactions. The use of molten salts as a medium for the sulfur-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane has been explored to overcome these challenges, aiming to develop a catalyst system that allows for efficient and selective dehydrogenation processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于高温导致燃料裂解和燃烧，尤其是对于像丁烷这样的高碳烷烃。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过允许较低的温度条件（大约1000-1200华氏度或640-650摄氏度）进行丁烯或乙基苯的脱氢作用，并利用熔融盐高效散发反应热，防止燃料和产品降解，从而解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和潜在副反应方面存在自身的挑战。已经探索使用熔融盐作为介质来促进硫促进的氧化脱氢化丁烷，以克服这些挑战，旨在开发一种催化剂系统，实现高效且选择性的脱氢过程。
