[1] "The system is also shown to be efficient for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, butene to butadiene and ethylbenzene to styrene."
[2] "Additionally, dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene releases twice as much heat as does butene or ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and this aggravates the problems of burning and cracking of the feed."
[3] "In an effort to overcome these problems, experiments were carried out to utilize molten salts as media for the sulphur promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane."
[4] "This paper describes the experimental program to develop suitable molten systems for the dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene, the optimization of these systems and their application to other feedstocks such as ethane, propane, butene and ethylbenzene."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the high energy consumption and potential for feed degradation during the dehydrogenation process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing energy consumption and improving product purity. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, including the selection of an appropriate oxidant and managing the high heat release during the process, which can lead to feed degradation through burning and cracking.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, ethane, propane, butene, and ethylbenzene is efficiently carried out using a molten salt system. This method helps overcome the high heat release issue during butane dehydrogenation, which often causes feed degradation. The use of molten salts as a reaction medium provides rapid heat dissipation, preventing the formation of hot spots that can degrade the feed.

3. To address the challenges posed by high heat release in butane dehydrogenation, experiments were conducted utilizing molten salts as a reaction medium for sulfur-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation. Molten salts offer several advantages over conventional methods, including excellent heat transfer properties, high thermal stability, low viscosity, and the ability to easily remove decomposition products from the surface of the catalyst.

4. The experimental program detailed in this paper aims to develop suitable molten systems for the dehydrogenation of butane to butadiene, optimize these systems, and extend their application to other feedstocks such as ethane, propane, butene, and ethylbenzene. The goal is to achieve high yields of olefinic products while minimizing the risks associated with heat release and feed degradation.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和生产过程中原料可能的降解问题。通过氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，因为它有可能降低能耗并提高产品纯度。然而，ODHP自身也存在一些挑战，包括选择合适的氧化剂以及管理过程中的高热释放，这可能导致原料通过燃烧和裂解而降解。

2. 使用熔融盐体系，丙烷、乙烷、丙烷、丁烯和乙苯的氧化脱氢反应得到高效进行。这种方法有助于克服在丁烷脱氢过程中产生的高热量问题，该过程往往导致原料降解。熔融盐作为反应介质提供了快速的热量散发，防止形成可能导致原料降解的热点。

3. 为了应对丁烷脱氢过程中高热量释放带来的挑战，进行了实验以利用熔融盐作为硫促进氧化脱氢的反应介质。熔融盐具有多种优势，包括出色的传热性能、高热稳定性、低粘度以及能够容易地从催化剂表面去除分解产物。

4. 本文中描述的实验项目旨在开发适用于丁烷到丁二烯脱氢的合适熔融系统，优化这些系统，并将它们应用到其他原料如乙烷、丙烷、丁烯和乙苯上。目标是实现高收率的烯烃产品，同时尽量减少与热量释放和原料降解相关的问题。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, potential environmental impacts, and the need for specialized catalysts that may limit the process's versatility. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method. By using hydrogen sulphide as a promoter, ODHP can achieve high yields of C4 olefins, including propylene, under milder conditions compared to traditional methods. This approach is advantageous because it can operate at lower temperatures and pressures, reducing the risk of feed degradation through cracking or burning. However, the choice of oxidant, particularly in selecting between oxygen and air, introduces complexities related to product analysis and potential product separation challenges. The use of molten salts as a reaction medium helps manage the heat generated during the reaction, preventing localized overheating and degradation of the feedstock. The LiCl/KCl/MnCl2 system specifically demonstrates broad applicability across various dehydrogenation reactions, showcasing the potential for a universal catalyst solution. This system's effectiveness in multiple reactions suggests a significant advantage over solid heterogeneous catalysts, which often require specific catalysts tailored to each reactant.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, environmental concerns due to potential emissions, and the complexity of achieving high yields from saturated feedstocks. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. This process utilizes hydrogen sulphide as a promoter, enabling the conversion of propane to propylene with high yields. The use of molten salts as a reaction medium helps in dissipating heat effectively, preventing the formation of hot spots that could degrade the feed and products. The promotion by hydrogen sulphide allows for the utilization of mild conditions, which are more sustainable compared to traditional methods. However, the selection of the oxidant, particularly between oxygen and air, presents a challenge. Oxygen provides a more direct and efficient oxidation pathway, whereas air introduces additional complications due to the presence of nitrogen, which can mask the results in the analysis. Despite these challenges, ODHP offers significant advantages over conventional methods, including higher yields, lower energy consumption, and reduced environmental impact. The specific benefits and limitations of ODHP are influenced by factors such as the choice of reactants, the optimization of reaction conditions, and the selection of appropriate catalysts or promoters.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Ethane dehydrogenation requires more severe conditions, reaching up to 1300F (705C), because it lacks activated hydrogen atoms that are present in butene or the benzene nucleus in ethylbenzene. This high temperature is feasible only due to the high stability of the small ethane molecule. The absence of these activated hydrogen atoms necessitates higher temperatures to achieve dehydrogenation.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high temperatures leading to cracking and burning of feed, especially with higher paraffins like butane. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by allowing mild temperature conditions for dehydrogenation of butene or ethylbenzene (around 1000-1200F or 640-650C) and using molten salts to efficiently dissipate reaction heat, preventing degradation of feed and products. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges related to oxidant selection and potential side reactions. The use of molten salts as a medium for the sulfur-promoted oxidative dehydrogenation of butane has been explored to overcome these challenges, aiming to develop a catalyst system that allows for efficient and selective dehydrogenation processes.
