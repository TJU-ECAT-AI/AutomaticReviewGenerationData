[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "Propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, potential safety hazards, and environmental concerns related to emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, which minimizes energy usage and environmental impact. However, the selection of the oxidant, particularly oxygen, presents challenges due to the potential for over-oxidation leading to significant carbon oxides (COx) formation. Using oxygen requires careful control to prevent unwanted reactions and maintain propene yield. The use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst offers a selective pathway for propene production, with the potential to form C1 and C2 products through both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、潜在的安全隐患和与排放相关的环境问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供较低的反应温度和减少焦炭形成，解决了这些挑战，从而降低了能源消耗并减少了对环境的影响。然而，选择氧化剂，尤其是氧气，存在挑战，因为这可能导致过氧化，导致大量二氧化碳（COx）生成。使用氧气需要仔细控制，以防止不必要的反应并保持丙烯产率。将六方氮化硼（h-BN）用作催化剂提供了选择性途径来生产丙烯，同时能够通过表面介导和气体相自由基路径形成C1和C2产品。
