[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[3] "Our SVUV-PIMS results provided direct and unambiguous detection of gas-phase methyl radicals in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts."
[4] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, potential environmental impacts due to the use of oxidants, and the complexity of the redox processes involved. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly approach by utilizing propane as a feedstock and producing propylene directly. The choice of oxidant is critical, as it affects the selectivity and purity of the propylene product. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP presents challenges related to the formation of unwanted byproducts, such as carbon oxides. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include its reactivity, which can lead to over-oxidation and the formation of carbon oxides, and the need for precise control over reaction conditions to ensure optimal propylene yield and selectivity. Despite these challenges, ODHP provides an advantageous pathway for propylene production, offering potential for higher efficiency and lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods.
