[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
[4] "Propene is mainly formed from the surface reaction, while C1 and C2 products are formed via both channels."
[5] "By coupling the results from kinetic and SVUV-PIMS studies with DFT calculations, detailed reaction pathways are proposed for the various products from ODHP over boron-based catalysts."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, potential environmental concerns due to the use of strong oxidants, and the risk of coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with lower emissions and reduced coke formation. The use of oxygen as an oxidant is advantageous because it is abundant and less expensive compared to alternatives. However, the challenge lies in selecting an appropriate oxidant that balances efficiency and environmental impact. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include managing the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensuring optimal temperature control to maximize yield and selectivity.
