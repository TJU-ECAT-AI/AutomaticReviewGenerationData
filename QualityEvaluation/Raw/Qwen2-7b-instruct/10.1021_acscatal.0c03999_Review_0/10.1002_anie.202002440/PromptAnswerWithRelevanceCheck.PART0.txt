[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."
[2] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."
[3] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[4] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."
[5] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[6] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx, which impedes the commercialization of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process. The use of oxygen as an oxidant presents specific challenges in ODHP, particularly concerning the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts offers advantages with low COx formation and high selectivity to ethylene, differing from traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts. However, the reaction mechanisms, especially the radical chemistry involved in the ODHP process over h-BN, remain unclear. The research demonstrates that propene is primarily produced through surface-mediated reactions on the h-BN catalyst, while C1 and C2 products can form via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, potential environmental impacts due to the use of oxidants, and the complexity of the redox processes involved. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly approach by utilizing propane as a feedstock and producing propylene directly. The choice of oxidant is critical, as it affects the selectivity and purity of the propylene product. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP presents challenges related to the formation of unwanted byproducts, such as carbon oxides. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include its reactivity, which can lead to over-oxidation and the formation of carbon oxides, and the need for precise control over reaction conditions to ensure optimal propylene yield and selectivity. Despite these challenges, ODHP provides an advantageous pathway for propylene production, offering potential for higher efficiency and lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, potential environmental concerns due to the use of strong oxidants, and the risk of coke formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process with lower emissions and reduced coke formation. The use of oxygen as an oxidant is advantageous because it is abundant and less expensive compared to alternatives. However, the challenge lies in selecting an appropriate oxidant that balances efficiency and environmental impact. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include managing the exothermic nature of the reaction to prevent overheating and ensuring optimal temperature control to maximize yield and selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, potential safety hazards, and environmental concerns related to emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering lower reaction temperatures and reduced coke formation, which minimizes energy usage and environmental impact. However, the selection of the oxidant, particularly oxygen, presents challenges due to the potential for over-oxidation leading to significant carbon oxides (COx) formation. Using oxygen requires careful control to prevent unwanted reactions and maintain propene yield. The use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst offers a selective pathway for propene production, with the potential to form C1 and C2 products through both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy consumption and environmental impact due to the formation of COx during the process. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more thermodynamically favorable approach with lower reaction temperatures, reducing the energy requirements. However, a major challenge is the risk of over-oxidation of olefins, leading to significant COx formation. Using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst addresses this issue by significantly reducing COx formation while maintaining high selectivity for propene production. The redox mechanism typically follows in the ODHP process, with the surface lattice oxygen of transition metal oxides playing a critical role. Recent research has suggested that the gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalysts might influence the ODHP reaction, particularly affecting the catalytic activity and the relationship between activity and contact time. Wang et al. proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the cleavage of CC bonds, leading to secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP. SVUV-PIMS is a powerful tool for detecting reactive, unstable, and short-lived gas-phase radicals and intermediates in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Notably, the presence of nitric oxide (NO) was detected on the BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures and propane conversion, consistent with GC-TCD results. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to construct the reaction mechanism, including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和环境影响，由于过程中形成COx。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种更热力学有利的方法，具有较低的反应温度，减少了能量需求。然而，主要的挑战是烯烃过氧化的风险，导致大量COx的形成。使用六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂解决了这个问题，通过显著减少COx的形成并保持高丙烯选择性。通常，还原机制在ODHP过程中起作用，表面过渡金属氧化物的氧是关键因素。最近的研究表明，h-BN催化剂的气相自由基化学可能会影响ODHP反应，特别是影响活性与接触时间的关系。王等人提出，从CC键断裂生成甲基自由基在h-BN表面上产生，导致涉及甲基自由基的二次反应途径在ODHP期间发生。SVUV-PIMS是一种强大的工具，用于检测异质催化反应中的反应性、不稳定性和寿命短的气体自由基和中间体。值得注意的是，在BN-T-high催化剂上检测到硝酸盐（NO）在高温和丙烷转化率高的情况下，与GC-TCD结果一致。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算被用来构建ODHP在硼氮化合物催化剂上的反应机制，包括路径和自由基化学。
