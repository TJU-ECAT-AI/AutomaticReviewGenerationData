The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high energy consumption and environmental impact due to the formation of COx during the process. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more thermodynamically favorable approach with lower reaction temperatures, reducing the energy requirements. However, a major challenge is the risk of over-oxidation of olefins, leading to significant COx formation. Using hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst addresses this issue by significantly reducing COx formation while maintaining high selectivity for propene production. The redox mechanism typically follows in the ODHP process, with the surface lattice oxygen of transition metal oxides playing a critical role. Recent research has suggested that the gas-phase radical chemistry of h-BN catalysts might influence the ODHP reaction, particularly affecting the catalytic activity and the relationship between activity and contact time. Wang et al. proposed that methyl radicals are generated on the h-BN surface from the cleavage of CC bonds, leading to secondary reaction pathways involving methyl radicals during ODHP. SVUV-PIMS is a powerful tool for detecting reactive, unstable, and short-lived gas-phase radicals and intermediates in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. Notably, the presence of nitric oxide (NO) was detected on the BN-T-high catalyst at high temperatures and propane conversion, consistent with GC-TCD results. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to construct the reaction mechanism, including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和环境影响，由于过程中形成COx。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种更热力学有利的方法，具有较低的反应温度，减少了能量需求。然而，主要的挑战是烯烃过氧化的风险，导致大量COx的形成。使用六方氮化硼（h-BN）作为催化剂解决了这个问题，通过显著减少COx的形成并保持高丙烯选择性。通常，还原机制在ODHP过程中起作用，表面过渡金属氧化物的氧是关键因素。最近的研究表明，h-BN催化剂的气相自由基化学可能会影响ODHP反应，特别是影响活性与接触时间的关系。王等人提出，从CC键断裂生成甲基自由基在h-BN表面上产生，导致涉及甲基自由基的二次反应途径在ODHP期间发生。SVUV-PIMS是一种强大的工具，用于检测异质催化反应中的反应性、不稳定性和寿命短的气体自由基和中间体。值得注意的是，在BN-T-high催化剂上检测到硝酸盐（NO）在高温和丙烷转化率高的情况下，与GC-TCD结果一致。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算被用来构建ODHP在硼氮化合物催化剂上的反应机制，包括路径和自由基化学。
