[1] "Propene (C3H6) is mainly produced by the steam cracking of oil-derived naphtha or the direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH)."
[2] "However, the commercialization of the ODHP process has not been achieved because of the runaway over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx."
[3] "Recently, several research groups have reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an outstanding and selective catalyst for the ODH of alkanes to corresponding olefins with only negligible COx formation."
[4] "Different from the traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts in ODHP reaction, h-BN shows very low selectivity to carbon oxides and relatively high selectivity to ethylene, compared to V-based catalysts where the main by-products are COx."
[5] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[6] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the over-oxidation of olefins leading to significant amounts of COx, which impedes the commercialization of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process. The use of oxygen as an oxidant presents specific challenges in ODHP, particularly concerning the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts offers advantages with low COx formation and high selectivity to ethylene, differing from traditional vanadium and molybdenum-based redox metal oxide catalysts. However, the reaction mechanisms, especially the radical chemistry involved in the ODHP process over h-BN, remain unclear. The research demonstrates that propene is primarily produced through surface-mediated reactions on the h-BN catalyst, while C1 and C2 products can form via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括烯烃的过度氧化导致大量COx的生成，这阻碍了氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程的商业化。氧气作为氧化剂在ODHP过程中存在特定的挑战，特别是在选择性和效率方面。以六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂为载体的丙烷氧化脱氢提供了优势，具有低COx形成和高乙烯选择性，与传统的钒和钼基可逆金属氧化物催化剂不同。然而，h-BN催化剂上涉及的反应机制，尤其是其中的自由基化学，仍然不清楚。研究显示，丙烯主要通过h-BN催化剂表面的反应产生，而C1和C2产物可以通过表面介导和气相途径形成。
