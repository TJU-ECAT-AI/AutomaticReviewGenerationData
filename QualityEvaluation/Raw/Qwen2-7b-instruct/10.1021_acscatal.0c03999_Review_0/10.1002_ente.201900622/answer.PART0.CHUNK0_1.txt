[1] "Vast conventional and unconventional natural-gas reserves are rich in ethane, propane, and butane, offering a great potential as feedstock to produce ethylene, propylene, and butylene, the platform molecules for the manufacture of virtually all chemicals, polymers, and fuels."
[2] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[3] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."
[4] "Consequently, these processes are economical only at large scales in centralized plants, which prevent the use of a significant share (30%) of the world's natural-gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas due to their prohibitive shipping costs."
[5] "In this direction, various routes, including partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been proposed and extensively investigated in the last decades, disclosing several catalytic systems, mainly based on metal oxides."
[6] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."
[7] "This is most likely due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and especially butane (Figure 1), which renders selectivity control a great challenge."
[8] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."
[9] "Among different halogen-based dehydrogenating agents and/or strategies that can be applied, including molecular halogens, dibromomethane, and/or molten metal halides or oxyhalides, alkane oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with O2 and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and proceeds via alkyl chloride generation and its consecutive dehydrochlorination, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to selectively (95%) generate olefins from ethane and propane."
[10] "Despite these results, almost no studies have tackled butane oxychlorination."
[11] "In this study, we elucidate the role of the alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution attained in the oxychlorination of ethane (EOC), propane (POC), and butane (BOC) over metal phosphates (Fe, Mn, V), EuOCl, titanium oxide (TiO2), and cerium oxide (CeO2)."
[12] "The systematic evaluation of the oxychlorination and oxidation of the alkanes, HCl oxidation, as well as the dehydrochlorination of the alkyl chlorides enabled to extract kinetic footprints, rationalizing the observed activity and selectivity patterns as a function of the carbon number."
[13] "Interestingly, while the ranking hardly changed in EOC, strong differences were observed in POC and BOC. This could be attributed to possible non-catalytic reaction pathways that can occur with in situ generated molecular chlorine, particularly over CeO2 and (VO)2P2O7 that are active HCl oxidation catalysts (vide infra) and especially with more reactive propane and butane substrates."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy intensity, economic viability at large scales in centralized plants, and prohibitive shipping costs for natural gas reserves located in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing energy consumption and enabling decentralized production, especially in remote locations. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and dealing with the specific challenges associated with using oxygen.

2. The study investigates the role of the alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution in the oxychlorination of ethane, propane, and butane over various catalysts. The systematic evaluation of oxychlorination and related reactions helps extract kinetic footprints and rationalize the observed activity and selectivity patterns based on the carbon number. This includes differences in the activity and selectivity patterns observed in ethane, propane, and butane oxychlorination, attributing them to factors such as the structure of the alkane and the nature of the catalysts used.
