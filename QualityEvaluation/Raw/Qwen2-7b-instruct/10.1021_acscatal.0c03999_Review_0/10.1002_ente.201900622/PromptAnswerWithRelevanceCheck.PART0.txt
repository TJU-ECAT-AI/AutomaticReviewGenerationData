[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3 × 1018 J per year."
[3] "Consequently, these processes are economical only at large scales in centralized plants, which prevent the use of a significant share (30%) of the world's natural-gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas due to their prohibitive shipping costs."
[4] "In this direction, various routes, including partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been proposed and extensively investigated in the last decades, disclosing several catalytic systems, mainly based on metal oxides."
[5] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."
[6] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."
[7] "Among different halogen-based dehydrogenating agents and/or strategies that can be applied, including molecular halogens, dibromomethane, and/or molten metal halides or oxyhalides, alkane oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with O2 and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and proceeds via alkyl chloride generation and its consecutive dehydrochlorination, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to selectively (95%) generate olefins from ethane and propane."
[8] "Despite these results, almost no studies have tackled butane oxychlorination."
[9] "In this study, we elucidate the role of the alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution attained in the oxychlorination of ethane (EOC), propane (POC), and butane (BOC) over metal phosphates (Fe, Mn, V), EuOCl, titanium oxide (TiO2), and cerium oxide (CeO2)."

Answer: The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, as discussed in the literature, revolve around the high energy demand of processes like steam and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, as well as catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These methods are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking alone accounting for substantial energy consumption globally. This makes the processes economically viable only at large scales in centralized plants, limiting their application to natural gas reserves in remote areas due to prohibitive shipping costs. Alternative methods, such as partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, have been explored but face limitations in producing olefins from propane and butane, yielding only 30% due to side reactions like cracking and combustion. Halogen-based routes offer an attractive alternative by enabling the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under milder conditions. Among halogen-based strategies, alkane oxychlorination, which involves the reaction of an alkane with oxygen and HCl leading to alkyl chloride generation and subsequent dehydrochlorination, has proven effective in selectively generating olefins from ethane and propane, achieving yields of up to 95%. However, the literature notes that butane oxychlorination has received minimal attention, highlighting it as an area for further exploration. The study presented aims to elucidate the role of alkane substrate in the oxychlorination of ethane, propane, and butane over various metal phosphates, europium oxychloride, titanium oxide, and cerium oxide catalysts, thereby addressing the limitations in propylene production from butane.

答案：文献中提到的当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战集中在过程的高度能源需求，包括蒸汽和流体催化裂解石脑油或乙烷原料以及轻质烷烃的催化脱氢。这些方法能耗巨大，仅蒸汽裂解在全球每年消耗的能量就高达约3×10^18焦耳。这使得这些过程在大型集中化工厂中经济可行，限制了它们对远程和分散地区的大量天然气储备的应用，因为这些地区的运输成本高昂。替代方法，如部分氧化和轻质烷烃的氧化脱氢，过去几十年里已被提出并广泛研究，揭示了几种催化剂系统，主要基于金属氧化物。尽管在乙烷到乙烯过程中可以实现高达75%的产率，但从丙烷和特别是丁烷进行这些反应时的产率显著受限，导致仅能实现30%的产率，原因是典型的催化系统（如碱土金属钒酸盐和多金属氧化物）会引发副反应，如裂解和燃烧路径。为了遏制这些烷烃及其衍生物的过度反应性，卤素基途径构成有吸引力的方法，因为它能够在相对温和的温度和压力条件下选择性地激活轻质碳氢化合物。不同的卤素基脱氢剂和/或策略，包括分子卤素、二溴甲烷或熔融金属卤化物或卤化物，烷烃氧氯化已经证明是选择性地从乙烷和丙烷生成烯烃的有前景的方法，实现了高达95%的选择性产率。然而，文献指出，对于丁烷氧氯化几乎没有进行过研究。在这项研究中，我们探讨了作为金属磷酸盐（铁、锰、钒）、铕氧氯化物、二氧化钛和氧化铈催化剂底物的烷烃在氧氯化中的活性和产物分布，旨在解决从丁烷生产丙烯的局限性。

[12] "The systematic evaluation of the oxychlorination and oxidation of the alkanes, HCl oxidation, as well as the dehydrochlorination of the alkyl chlorides enabled to extract kinetic footprints, rationalizing the observed activity and selectivity patterns as a function of the carbon number."
[13] "Interestingly, while the ranking hardly changed in EOC, strong differences were observed in POC and BOC. This could be attributed to possible non-catalytic reaction pathways that can occur with in situ generated molecular chlorine, particularly over CeO2 and (VO)2P2O7 that are active HCl oxidation catalysts (vide infra) and especially with more reactive propane and butane substrates."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy intensity, economic viability at large scales in centralized plants, and prohibitive shipping costs for natural gas reserves located in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing energy consumption and enabling decentralized production, especially in remote locations. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and dealing with the specific challenges associated with using oxygen.

2. The study investigates the role of the alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution in the oxychlorination of ethane, propane, and butane over various catalysts. The systematic evaluation of oxychlorination and related reactions helps extract kinetic footprints and rationalize the observed activity and selectivity patterns based on the carbon number. This includes differences in the activity and selectivity patterns observed in ethane, propane, and butane oxychlorination, attributing them to factors such as the structure of the alkane and the nature of the catalysts used.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, economic viability only at large scales in centralized plants, and prohibitive shipping costs for natural gas reserves located in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially exothermic, one-step, decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. In terms of oxidant selection, oxygen is commonly used due to its availability and efficiency. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen involve maintaining optimal reaction conditions to prevent side reactions, such as cracking and combustion, which can limit olefin yield.

2. The study investigates the role of alkane substrate in the oxychlorination of ethane, propane, and butane over various catalysts. It aims to understand the impact of alkane structure on the complex oxychlorination reaction network and to rationalize the observed activity and selectivity patterns as a function of the carbon number.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demand, cost inefficiency for decentralized processes, and the difficulty in controlling selectivity, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). ODHP presents advantages such as producing propylene from propane directly, reducing the need for additional processing steps. However, it faces limitations like the need for efficient oxidants, the complexity in oxidant selection, and the challenges associated with using oxygen. Specifically, the use of oxygen requires careful management to avoid unwanted side reactions like cracking and combustion, which limit the yield of propylene. Additionally, the selectivity of propylene production from propane is significantly influenced by the catalyst's performance and the efficiency of the reaction pathway.

1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, are their high energy intensity. Steam cracking alone consumes approximately 3 × 10^18 J annually worldwide. These processes are economically viable only at large scales in centralized plants, limiting the utilization of a significant portion (30%) of the world's natural-gas reserves located in remote areas due to their high shipping costs.

2. Although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane remains significantly less efficient. Typical yields are around 30%, due to side reactions involving cracking and combustion pathways over conventional catalytic systems, like alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides.

3. The weaker C-H and C-C bonds in propane and especially butane make it challenging to control selectivity in these reactions. Halogen-based routes, such as alkane oxychlorination, offer an attractive alternative because they allow for the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure.

4. Alkane oxychlorination involves reacting an alkane with O2 and HCl, leading to the generation of alkyl chlorides followed by their dehydrochlorination. This process has been proven effective in selectively generating olefins from ethane and propane, achieving yields of up to 95%.

5. The document highlights the difficulties in controlling selectivity when dealing with propane and butane due to their weaker bonds. Halogen-based methods, like alkane oxychlorination, offer a way to selectively activate light hydrocarbons under moderate conditions, potentially overcoming these challenges.
