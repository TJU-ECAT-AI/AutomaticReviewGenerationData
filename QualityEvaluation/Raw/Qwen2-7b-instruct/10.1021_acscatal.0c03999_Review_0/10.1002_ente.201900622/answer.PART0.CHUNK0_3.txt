[1] "Consequently, these processes are economical only at large scales in centralized plants, which prevent the use of a significant share (30%) of the world's natural-gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas due to their prohibitive shipping costs."
[2] "Despite these results, almost no studies have tackled butane oxychlorination. In essence, only one patent describes a process for the production of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, an useful solvent and intermediate for dyes production, by oxychlorination of straight-chain C4 hydrocarbons over a Cu-based catalyst, and no formation of olefins was reported."
[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demand, cost inefficiency for decentralized processes, and the difficulty in controlling selectivity, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). ODHP presents advantages such as producing propylene from propane directly, reducing the need for additional processing steps. However, it faces limitations like the need for efficient oxidants, the complexity in oxidant selection, and the challenges associated with using oxygen. Specifically, the use of oxygen requires careful management to avoid unwanted side reactions like cracking and combustion, which limit the yield of propylene. Additionally, the selectivity of propylene production from propane is significantly influenced by the catalyst's performance and the efficiency of the reaction pathway.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能效需求、集中化过程的成本效率问题以及在控制选择性方面存在困难，特别是在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）过程中。ODHP的优势在于可以直接从丙烷中生产丙烯，减少了额外处理步骤的需求。然而，它面临着选择高效氧化剂、氧的选择性复杂性和使用氧气带来的挑战。具体来说，使用氧气需要精细管理以避免不希望的副反应如裂解和燃烧，这限制了丙烯的产率。此外，丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性受到催化剂性能和反应途径效率的影响。
