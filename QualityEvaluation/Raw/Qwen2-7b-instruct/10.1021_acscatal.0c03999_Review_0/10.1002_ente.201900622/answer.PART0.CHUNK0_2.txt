[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry,globally consuming around 3  1018 J per year."
[3] "Consequently, these processes are economical only at large scales in centralized plants, which prevent the use of a significant share (30%) of the worlds natural-gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas due to their prohibitive shipping costs."
[4] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."
[5] "Among different halogen-based dehydrogenating agents and/or strategies that can be applied, including molecular halogens,[22,23] dibromomethane,[24] and/or molten metal halides or oxyhalides,[25,26] alkane oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with O2 and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and proceeds via alkyl chloride generation and its consecutive dehydrochlorination, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to selectively (95%) generate olefins from ethane and propane."
[6] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion path-ways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."
[7] "In essence,only one patent describes a process for the production of 1,4-dichlorobutadiene, an useful solvent and intermediate for dyes production, by oxychlorination of straight-chain C4 hydrocarbons over a Cu-based catalyst, and no formation of olefins was reported."
[8] "In this study, we elucidate the role of the alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution attained in the oxychlorination of ethane (EOC), propane (POC), and butane (BOC) over metal phosphates (Fe, Mn, V), EuOCl, titanium oxide (TiO2),and cerium oxide (CeO2)."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, economic viability only at large scales in centralized plants, and prohibitive shipping costs for natural gas reserves located in remote areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially exothermic, one-step, decentralized process. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. In terms of oxidant selection, oxygen is commonly used due to its availability and efficiency. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen involve maintaining optimal reaction conditions to prevent side reactions, such as cracking and combustion, which can limit olefin yield.

2. The study investigates the role of alkane substrate in the oxychlorination of ethane, propane, and butane over various catalysts. It aims to understand the impact of alkane structure on the complex oxychlorination reaction network and to rationalize the observed activity and selectivity patterns as a function of the carbon number.
