[1] "Currently, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3 × 10^18 J per year."
[2] "Consequently, these processes are economical only at large scales in centralized plants, which prevent the use of a significant share (30%) of the world's natural-gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas due to their prohibitive shipping costs."
[3] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."
[4] "This is most likely due to the weaker CH and CC bonds in propane and especially butane (Figure 1),[20,21] which renders selectivity control a great challenge."
[5] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."
[6] "Among different halogen-based dehydrogenating agents and/or strategies that can be applied, including molecular halogens,[22,23] dibromomethane,[24] and/or molten metal halides or oxyhalides,[25,26] alkane oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with O2 and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and proceeds via alkyl chloride generation and its consecutive dehydrochlorination, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to selectively (95%) generate olefins from ethane and propane.[27–29]"

1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods, such as steam and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes, are their high energy intensity. Steam cracking alone consumes approximately 3 × 10^18 J annually worldwide. These processes are economically viable only at large scales in centralized plants, limiting the utilization of a significant portion (30%) of the world's natural-gas reserves located in remote areas due to their high shipping costs.

2. Although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane remains significantly less efficient. Typical yields are around 30%, due to side reactions involving cracking and combustion pathways over conventional catalytic systems, like alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides.

3. The weaker C-H and C-C bonds in propane and especially butane make it challenging to control selectivity in these reactions. Halogen-based routes, such as alkane oxychlorination, offer an attractive alternative because they allow for the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure.

4. Alkane oxychlorination involves reacting an alkane with O2 and HCl, leading to the generation of alkyl chlorides followed by their dehydrochlorination. This process has been proven effective in selectively generating olefins from ethane and propane, achieving yields of up to 95%.

5. The document highlights the difficulties in controlling selectivity when dealing with propane and butane due to their weaker bonds. Halogen-based methods, like alkane oxychlorination, offer a way to selectively activate light hydrocarbons under moderate conditions, potentially overcoming these challenges.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是蒸汽和流体催化裂解石脑油或乙烷原料以及轻烃的脱氢反应，其能效非常高。仅蒸汽裂解每年消耗约3×10^18焦耳的能量。这些过程仅在大型集中工厂经济可行，限制了位于偏远地区的大约30%的世界天然气储备的利用，由于高昂的运输成本而无法使用。

2. 尽管可以达到高达75%的乙烷到乙烯转化率，从丙烷和尤其是丁烷中生产烯烃仍然效率较低。常规催化剂系统（如碱土金属钒酸盐和多金属氧化物）中，侧向裂解和燃烧路径导致丙烷和丁烷的产量约为30%。

3. 丙烷和尤其是丁烷较弱的C-H和C-C键使得控制选择性成为巨大挑战。卤素基路线，例如烷烃氧氯化，提供了吸引人的替代方案，因为它们允许在温和的温度和压力条件下选择性激活轻质碳氢化合物。

4. 烷烃氧氯化涉及烷烃与氧气和氢氯化物的反应，生成烷基氯化物，然后是其脱氯化。这种方法已被证明能够从乙烷和丙烷选择性地生成烯烃，达到高达95%的产率。

5. 文档强调了处理丙烷和丁烷时控制选择性的困难，由于它们较弱的键。卤素基方法，如烷烃氧氯化，提供了一种在温和条件下选择性激活轻质碳氢化合物的方式，可能克服这些挑战。
