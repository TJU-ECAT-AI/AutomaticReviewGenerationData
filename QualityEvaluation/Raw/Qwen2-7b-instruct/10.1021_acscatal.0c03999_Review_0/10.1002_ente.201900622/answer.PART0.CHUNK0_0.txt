[1] "Currently, these olefins are predominantly manufactured via steam- and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, and by catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "Nevertheless, these technologies are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking being estimated as the most energy-demanding process in the chemical industry, globally consuming around 3 × 1018 J per year."
[3] "Consequently, these processes are economical only at large scales in centralized plants, which prevent the use of a significant share (30%) of the world's natural-gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas due to their prohibitive shipping costs."
[4] "In this direction, various routes, including partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been proposed and extensively investigated in the last decades, disclosing several catalytic systems, mainly based on metal oxides."
[5] "Still, although yields of up to 75% can be achieved in ethane-to-ethylene processes, olefin production from propane and particularly butane in these reactions remains significantly more limited, resulting in yields of 30% due to side cracking and combustion pathways over typical catalytic systems, such as alkali or alkali earth-metal vanadates and multi-metal oxides."
[6] "To curtail the over-reactivity of these alkanes and/or their derivatives, halogen-based routes constitute attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure."
[7] "Among different halogen-based dehydrogenating agents and/or strategies that can be applied, including molecular halogens, dibromomethane, and/or molten metal halides or oxyhalides, alkane oxychlorination, which comprises the reaction of an alkane with O2 and hydrogen chloride (HCl) and proceeds via alkyl chloride generation and its consecutive dehydrochlorination, has been demonstrated as a promising approach to selectively (95%) generate olefins from ethane and propane."
[8] "Despite these results, almost no studies have tackled butane oxychlorination."
[9] "In this study, we elucidate the role of the alkane substrate on the activity and product distribution attained in the oxychlorination of ethane (EOC), propane (POC), and butane (BOC) over metal phosphates (Fe, Mn, V), EuOCl, titanium oxide (TiO2), and cerium oxide (CeO2)."

Answer: The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, as discussed in the literature, revolve around the high energy demand of processes like steam and fluid-catalytic cracking of naphtha or ethane feedstock, as well as catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These methods are highly energy-intensive, with steam cracking alone accounting for substantial energy consumption globally. This makes the processes economically viable only at large scales in centralized plants, limiting their application to natural gas reserves in remote areas due to prohibitive shipping costs. Alternative methods, such as partial oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, have been explored but face limitations in producing olefins from propane and butane, yielding only 30% due to side reactions like cracking and combustion. Halogen-based routes offer an attractive alternative by enabling the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under milder conditions. Among halogen-based strategies, alkane oxychlorination, which involves the reaction of an alkane with oxygen and HCl leading to alkyl chloride generation and subsequent dehydrochlorination, has proven effective in selectively generating olefins from ethane and propane, achieving yields of up to 95%. However, the literature notes that butane oxychlorination has received minimal attention, highlighting it as an area for further exploration. The study presented aims to elucidate the role of alkane substrate in the oxychlorination of ethane, propane, and butane over various metal phosphates, europium oxychloride, titanium oxide, and cerium oxide catalysts, thereby addressing the limitations in propylene production from butane.

答案：文献中提到的当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战集中在过程的高度能源需求，包括蒸汽和流体催化裂解石脑油或乙烷原料以及轻质烷烃的催化脱氢。这些方法能耗巨大，仅蒸汽裂解在全球每年消耗的能量就高达约3×10^18焦耳。这使得这些过程在大型集中化工厂中经济可行，限制了它们对远程和分散地区的大量天然气储备的应用，因为这些地区的运输成本高昂。替代方法，如部分氧化和轻质烷烃的氧化脱氢，过去几十年里已被提出并广泛研究，揭示了几种催化剂系统，主要基于金属氧化物。尽管在乙烷到乙烯过程中可以实现高达75%的产率，但从丙烷和特别是丁烷进行这些反应时的产率显著受限，导致仅能实现30%的产率，原因是典型的催化系统（如碱土金属钒酸盐和多金属氧化物）会引发副反应，如裂解和燃烧路径。为了遏制这些烷烃及其衍生物的过度反应性，卤素基途径构成有吸引力的方法，因为它能够在相对温和的温度和压力条件下选择性地激活轻质碳氢化合物。不同的卤素基脱氢剂和/或策略，包括分子卤素、二溴甲烷或熔融金属卤化物或卤化物，烷烃氧氯化已经证明是选择性地从乙烷和丙烷生成烯烃的有前景的方法，实现了高达95%的选择性产率。然而，文献指出，对于丁烷氧氯化几乎没有进行过研究。在这项研究中，我们探讨了作为金属磷酸盐（铁、锰、钒）、铕氧氯化物、二氧化钛和氧化铈催化剂底物的烷烃在氧氯化中的活性和产物分布，旨在解决从丁烷生产丙烯的局限性。
