[1] "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[3] "However, because of its high cost attempts have been made to reduce or eliminate it from the reaction system while still achieving high product yields."
[4] "Thermodynamically, the use of molecular sulphur for dehydrogenation seems quite feasible."
[5] "Examination of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F and above)."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the low yields obtained through thermal dehydrogenation, which is equilibrium-limited. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher yields since the reaction is not equilibrium-limited, and a thermodynamically stable product (water) is formed alongside the olefinic product. However, selecting the right oxidant is crucial, as using oxygen leads to uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in low product yields. To overcome this, researchers have explored the use of sulfur and halogen mixtures, which can potentially replace iodine or bromine at lower costs, while still achieving high product yields.

2. In the context of using oxygen as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, the main challenge is the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions leading to low product yields. To address this, sulfur and halogen mixtures have been suggested as alternatives. These alternatives aim to maintain high product yields while reducing costs, as sulfur is much cheaper than iodine or bromine. The sulfur vapor's molecular structure at the temperatures required for dehydrogenation reactions presents another challenge, as it necessitates high temperatures for obtaining reactive diradical species, which might lead to thermal cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于热脱氢化过程中低产量的问题，这受到平衡限制。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更高的产量来解决这些问题，因为反应不受平衡限制，并且与烯烃产品一起形成热力学稳定的产物（水）。然而，在选择合适的氧化剂时至关重要，使用氧气会导致失控的燃烧反应，从而导致低产品产量。为了克服这个问题，研究人员探索了硫和卤素混合物的应用，这些混合物有可能在较低的成本下替换碘或溴，同时仍然实现高产品产量。

2. 在使用氧气作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢化背景下，主要的挑战是发生失控的燃烧反应导致低产品产量。为了解决这个问题，建议使用硫和卤素混合物。这些替代品旨在保持高产品产量的同时降低成本，因为硫的价格远低于碘或溴。硫蒸气在进行脱氢化反应所需的温度下的分子结构也提出了另一个挑战，需要高温以获得反应性二原子物种，这可能导致裂解反应而不是脱氢化。

1. Challenges in current propylene production methods primarily involve the low yields and equilibrium limitations encountered in thermal dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by not being equilibrium-limited, as a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is formed alongside the olefinic product. This allows for potentially higher yields. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, including difficulties in reaction control and the requirement for halogen promoters.

2. The primary advantages of ODHP are its ability to achieve high yields without being constrained by equilibrium limitations. This is due to the formation of a stable product (H2O) alongside the desired olefinic products. The disadvantages include the need for halogen promoters, which can be costly and challenging to recycle, and difficulties in controlling the reaction under practical conditions.

3. In the context of oxidant selection, oxygen is preferred in ODHP because it facilitates the reaction at all temperatures and results in a highly exothermic process. Halogen promoters are used to enhance the reaction rates, especially iodine, which is found to be the most effective when used in sub-stoichiometric quantities. However, sulfur can be used as an alternative to halogens, offering potential economic benefits due to its lower cost compared to iodine and bromine.

4. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP are related to its practical application in the presence of halogen promoters. While oxygen promotes the reaction effectively, achieving high yields requires careful management of the reaction conditions, including the precise control of oxygen and halogen concentrations. The use of sulfur as a promoter offers a more economical solution, but its application requires suitable catalysts to efficiently convert sulfur vapor into reactive species.

5. The use of sulfur as a promoter in ODHP can significantly impact future processing schemes by providing an inexpensive substitute for halogen promoters. This could lead to substantial cost reductions, especially considering the high cost of halogen promoters like iodine. The feasibility of using sulfur vapor for dehydrogenation is hindered by its molecular structure and the need for high temperatures to obtain reactive species. However, the use of sulfur in conjunction with oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could potentially supply the reactive sulfur species required for the ODHP process, offering a promising avenue for reducing promoter costs and improving economic significance.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括热解氢化过程中遇到的低产率和平衡限制。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过避免平衡限制来解决这些问题，因为形成的稳定产物（H2O）与所需烯烃产品一起形成，这可能允许更高的产率。然而，ODHP也带来了自己的挑战，包括反应控制困难以及对卤素促进剂的需求。

2. ODHP的主要优势在于它能够实现高产率而无需受到平衡限制。这是由于形成了稳定的产物（H2O）与所需的烯烃产品一起。缺点包括需要卤素促进剂，这可能成本高昂且难以回收，以及在实际条件下控制反应的困难。

3. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，氧气在ODHP中被首选，因为它在所有温度下促进反应，并导致高度放热过程。卤素促进剂用于增强反应速率，尤其是碘，当以亚摩尔量使用时，发现是最有效的。然而，硫可以作为卤素的替代品使用，提供经济上的好处，因为其成本远低于碘和溴。

4. 使用氧气在ODHP中的具体挑战与其在卤素促进剂存在的条件下的实际应用有关。虽然氧气有效地促进了反应，但要获得高产率，需要精确管理反应条件，包括氧气和卤素浓度的精确控制。硫作为促进剂的应用提供了经济解决方案，尤其是考虑到卤素促进剂如碘的成本高昂。然而，硫的使用需要合适的催化剂将硫蒸汽转化为活性物种。

5. 硫在ODHP中的使用可以显著影响未来的加工方案，提供一种廉价替代卤素促进剂的选择。这可能导致成本大幅降低，特别是考虑到卤素促进剂如碘的成本高昂。硫蒸汽用于脱氢的可行性受其分子结构和需要高温才能获得活性物种的限制。然而，通过氢化硫（H2S）的氧化使用硫，有可能为ODHP过程提供所需的活性硫物种，提供减少促进剂成本和提高经济意义的有希望途径。

[II] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[III] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
[IV] "Although thermodynamic equilibria shown above are for the use of halogens in stoichiometric proportions, in practice the halogen promoted reactions are carried out in the presence of oxygen and with far less than stoichiometric proportions of halogens."
[V] "The most important kinetic and thermodynamic criterion in deciding the superiority of a given halogen in the oxydehydrogenation reaction must depend upon the ease with which its hydrogen halide is oxidized back to the halogen."
[VI] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F and above)."
[VII] "At such high temperatures most hydrocarbons will undergo thermal cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation to olefins."
[VIII] "Thus it would seem logical to take advantage of the H2S oxidation reaction to supply, insitu, the reactive sulphur species needed to replace the halogens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[IX] "Here it should be noted that the previous data indicating the high promoter efficiency of mixed halogens in an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction should in theory be directly applicable to a mixed halogen/sulphur promoted system."
[X] "Assuming iodine (M.W. = 253.8) is valued at $1.00/lb, bromine (M.W. = 159.8) at 30 cents/lb, chlorine (M.W. = 70.9) at 3 cents/lb and sulphur (A.W. = 32.1) at 2 cents/lb, then it can be shown that I mole of sulphur costs 64.2 cents and is equivalent in cost to 0.30 mole CI2 or 0.013 mole Br2 or 0.0025 mole I2."

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges due to low pass yields in equilibrium-limited reactions, especially when oxygen is used as the hydrogen abstractor. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a non-equilibrium-limited process that allows for the formation of olefinic products alongside water, avoiding the formation of harmful by-products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection and managing the reaction under controlled conditions to maximize product yields.

2. In the context of oxidant selection, the use of halogens like iodine, bromine, and chlorine as promoters in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions allows for high yields of olefins compared to using oxygen alone. The effectiveness of these halogens increases when used in combination, leading to even higher yields. However, these halogens come with high costs and difficulties in recovery for recycling, making them economically risky for commercial processes. 

3. The use of oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is problematic due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions, leading to low product yields and the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This contrasts with the use of halogens, which facilitate reactions without the risk of combustion, resulting in high yields of olefinic products.

4. The use of sulfur as a promoter in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions offers a potential cost-effective alternative to halogens. Sulfur is significantly cheaper than iodine, bromine, and chlorine, making it an attractive option for replacing or partially replacing halogen promoters. However, sulfur's molecular structure requires high temperatures to achieve the reactive, diradical species necessary for efficient dehydrogenation, which can lead to thermal cracking reactions instead of desired dehydrogenation.

5. To address the challenges of using sulfur as a promoter, it is suggested to utilize the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to regenerate sulfur in-situ. This approach aims to supply the reactive sulfur species needed for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, potentially replacing halogen promoters while maintaining high product yields. The feasibility of this replacement scheme depends on the development of suitable catalysts that can rapidly react sulfur with the hydrocarbon feed while minimizing the formation of inactive sulfur species.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临挑战，尤其是在使用氧气作为氢抽象剂时，平衡限制反应导致低转化率。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一个非平衡限制过程来解决这些问题，该过程允许形成烯烃产物和水，避免形成有害副产品如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和管理反应以最大化产品产率方面存在其自身的挑战。

2. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，碘、溴和氯等卤素作为氧化脱氢化反应促进剂的使用，与氧相比，在高产率的烯烃生成中提供了优势。这些卤素组合使用的有效性进一步提高，导致更高的产率。然而，这些卤素因其高昂的成本和回收困难而使商业过程经济上风险较大。

3. 相对于使用氧作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢化反应，容易发生不受控制的燃烧反应，导致低产率和二氧化碳和一氧化碳的形成。这与卤素的使用形成对比，卤素的使用能促进反应而不涉及燃烧风险，从而产生高产率的烯烃产物。

4. 硫作为氧化脱氢化反应促进剂的使用提供了成本效益高的替代方案。硫的价格远低于碘、溴和氯，使其成为替换或部分替换卤素促进剂的有吸引力的选择。然而，硫的分子结构要求高温才能达到高效脱氢所需的活性双原子硫物种，这可能导致热裂解反应而不是预期的脱氢反应。

5. 要解决使用硫作为促进剂的挑战，建议利用氢硫化物（H2S）的氧化再生硫的方法。这种方法旨在提供用于氧化脱氢化反应所需的有效硫物种，可能替代卤素促进剂的同时保持高产率的产品。实现这一替代方案的可行性取决于开发出能够快速将硫与烃基馈送物反应的催化剂，同时最小化形成无活性硫物种的形成。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which often rely on thermal dehydrogenation, include the equilibrium limitation of the reaction, leading to low product yields, and the formation of undesired by-products such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide when oxygen is used as the hydrogen abstractor. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a non-equilibrium process that allows for higher yields of olefinic products and reduces the formation of by-products. The process benefits from the use of halogen promoters like iodine, bromine, and chlorine, which facilitate the reaction under controlled conditions. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is limited by the formation of by-products and the requirement for additional catalysts. The introduction of sulfur as a promoter offers a potentially cost-effective alternative, especially when considering its relative abundance and lower cost compared to iodine and bromine. The challenges associated with sulfur vapor, including its molecular structure and the difficulty in obtaining high concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation, are addressed through its conversion into reactive forms like sulfur species (S2) through oxidation reactions. This conversion can enable sulfur to replace halogen promoters in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, potentially reducing promoter costs and enhancing the economic viability of the process.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括反应的平衡限制，导致低产品收率，以及当使用氧气作为氢抽象剂时形成的不希望有的副产品，如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供非平衡过程来解决这些问题，该过程允许更高比例的烯烃产品，并减少了形成副产品的可能性。该过程得益于卤素促进剂（如碘、溴和氯）的使用，这些促进剂在受控条件下促进了反应。然而，氧气作为氧化剂的应用受到形成副产品和需要额外催化剂的要求限制。引入硫作为促进剂提供了成本效益较高的替代方案，特别是考虑到其相对丰富性和与碘和溴相比较低的成本。硫蒸汽面临的挑战，包括其分子结构及其在高效脱氢化所需的高浓度下难以获得的问题，通过氧化反应将其转化为活性形式（如硫物种（S2））得以解决。这使得硫能够替代卤素促进剂在氧化脱氢化过程中使用，可能有助于降低促进剂成本并增强过程的经济可行性。
