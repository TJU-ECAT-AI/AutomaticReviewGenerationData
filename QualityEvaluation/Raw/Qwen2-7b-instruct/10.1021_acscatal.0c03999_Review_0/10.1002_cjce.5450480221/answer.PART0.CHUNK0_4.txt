[1] "Much attention has also hcen given to the selective, oxidative de- hydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[2] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the prcscnce of different catalysts, low product yiclds are ohrained due to the occrrence of uncontrolled corn- bustion rcactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[4] "A significant advance was made in the oxidative dehydrogenation technology when the Shell group of companies achieved success in the iodine promoted dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene."
[5] "Since bromine and chlorine are less expensive than iodine and can be used to wholly or partially replace the latter, the basis for an economically attractive,mixed halogen promoted, dehydrogenation process t)cconics apparent."
[6] "Although the thermodynamic equilibria shown above arc for the usc of halogens in stoichiometric proportions, in practice the halogcn promoted reactions are carried out in the presence of oxygen and with far less than stoichionietric proportions of halogens."
[7] "Thus it can be concluded that iodine is the most effective oxydehydrogenation promoter when present in sub-stoichiometric proportions,principally because it is almost always available in its most active (atomic) form in the reaction mixture due to the ease with which HI is oxidized."
[8] "When a butene-oxygen-steam feed mixture was passed over a catalyst,consisting of 5% CeOz and 1% CaO on Vycor chips, at I 1 S2"F,the top line of the table shows that in the absence of a halogen promoter a 6% butadiene yield was obtained at 30% butenc conversion and 20% butadiene selectivity."
[9] "Moreover it is known that the alkyl (or alkenyl) iodides dehydrohalogenate at much faster rate than the corresponding chlorocompounds."
[10] "Exami- nation of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-140O0F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (*), S,, in the high enough concentra- tions necessary for efficient dehydrogenation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, which often rely on thermal dehydrogenation, include the equilibrium limitation of the reaction, leading to low product yields, and the formation of undesired by-products such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide when oxygen is used as the hydrogen abstractor. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a non-equilibrium process that allows for higher yields of olefinic products and reduces the formation of by-products. The process benefits from the use of halogen promoters like iodine, bromine, and chlorine, which facilitate the reaction under controlled conditions. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant is limited by the formation of by-products and the requirement for additional catalysts. The introduction of sulfur as a promoter offers a potentially cost-effective alternative, especially when considering its relative abundance and lower cost compared to iodine and bromine. The challenges associated with sulfur vapor, including its molecular structure and the difficulty in obtaining high concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation, are addressed through its conversion into reactive forms like sulfur species (S2) through oxidation reactions. This conversion can enable sulfur to replace halogen promoters in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, potentially reducing promoter costs and enhancing the economic viability of the process.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括反应的平衡限制，导致低产品收率，以及当使用氧气作为氢抽象剂时形成的不希望有的副产品，如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供非平衡过程来解决这些问题，该过程允许更高比例的烯烃产品，并减少了形成副产品的可能性。该过程得益于卤素促进剂（如碘、溴和氯）的使用，这些促进剂在受控条件下促进了反应。然而，氧气作为氧化剂的应用受到形成副产品和需要额外催化剂的要求限制。引入硫作为促进剂提供了成本效益较高的替代方案，特别是考虑到其相对丰富性和与碘和溴相比较低的成本。硫蒸汽面临的挑战，包括其分子结构及其在高效脱氢化所需的高浓度下难以获得的问题，通过氧化反应将其转化为活性形式（如硫物种（S2））得以解决。这使得硫能够替代卤素促进剂在氧化脱氢化过程中使用，可能有助于降低促进剂成本并增强过程的经济可行性。
