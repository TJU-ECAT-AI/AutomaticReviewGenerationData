[1] "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[3] "However, because of its high cost attempts have been made to reduce or eliminate it from the reaction system while still achieving high product yields."
[4] "Thermodynamically, the use of molecular sulphur for dehydrogenation seems quite feasible."
[5] "Examination of Figure 4 shows that sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F and above)."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the low yields obtained through thermal dehydrogenation, which is equilibrium-limited. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher yields since the reaction is not equilibrium-limited, and a thermodynamically stable product (water) is formed alongside the olefinic product. However, selecting the right oxidant is crucial, as using oxygen leads to uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in low product yields. To overcome this, researchers have explored the use of sulfur and halogen mixtures, which can potentially replace iodine or bromine at lower costs, while still achieving high product yields.

2. In the context of using oxygen as an oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, the main challenge is the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions leading to low product yields. To address this, sulfur and halogen mixtures have been suggested as alternatives. These alternatives aim to maintain high product yields while reducing costs, as sulfur is much cheaper than iodine or bromine. The sulfur vapor's molecular structure at the temperatures required for dehydrogenation reactions presents another challenge, as it necessitates high temperatures for obtaining reactive diradical species, which might lead to thermal cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于热脱氢化过程中低产量的问题，这受到平衡限制。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更高的产量来解决这些问题，因为反应不受平衡限制，并且与烯烃产品一起形成热力学稳定的产物（水）。然而，在选择合适的氧化剂时至关重要，使用氧气会导致失控的燃烧反应，从而导致低产品产量。为了克服这个问题，研究人员探索了硫和卤素混合物的应用，这些混合物有可能在较低的成本下替换碘或溴，同时仍然实现高产品产量。

2. 在使用氧气作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢化背景下，主要的挑战是发生失控的燃烧反应导致低产品产量。为了解决这个问题，建议使用硫和卤素混合物。这些替代品旨在保持高产品产量的同时降低成本，因为硫的价格远低于碘或溴。硫蒸气在进行脱氢化反应所需的温度下的分子结构也提出了另一个挑战，需要高温以获得反应性二原子物种，这可能导致裂解反应而不是脱氢化。
