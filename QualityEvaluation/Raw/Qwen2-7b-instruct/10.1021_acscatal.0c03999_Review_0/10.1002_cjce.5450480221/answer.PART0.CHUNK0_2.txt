[I] "Much attention has also been given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[II] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yields are obtained due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[III] "An even more attractive process can be visualized if sulphur is also used in admixture with the above halogens, particularly bromine and chlorine."
[IV] "Although thermodynamic equilibria shown above are for the use of halogens in stoichiometric proportions, in practice the halogen promoted reactions are carried out in the presence of oxygen and with far less than stoichiometric proportions of halogens."
[V] "The most important kinetic and thermodynamic criterion in deciding the superiority of a given halogen in the oxydehydrogenation reaction must depend upon the ease with which its hydrogen halide is oxidized back to the halogen."
[VI] "Sulphur vapor has to be heated to high temperatures (e.g. 1200-1400°F) in order to obtain the reactive, diradical species (S2), in the high enough concentrations necessary for efficient dehydrogenation (monoatomic sulphur is known to exist only at even higher temperatures, i.e. 3000°F and above)."
[VII] "At such high temperatures most hydrocarbons will undergo thermal cracking reactions rather than dehydrogenation to olefins."
[VIII] "Thus it would seem logical to take advantage of the H2S oxidation reaction to supply, insitu, the reactive sulphur species needed to replace the halogens in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction."
[IX] "Here it should be noted that the previous data indicating the high promoter efficiency of mixed halogens in an oxidative dehydrogenation reaction should in theory be directly applicable to a mixed halogen/sulphur promoted system."
[X] "Assuming iodine (M.W. = 253.8) is valued at $1.00/lb, bromine (M.W. = 159.8) at 30 cents/lb, chlorine (M.W. = 70.9) at 3 cents/lb and sulphur (A.W. = 32.1) at 2 cents/lb, then it can be shown that I mole of sulphur costs 64.2 cents and is equivalent in cost to 0.30 mole CI2 or 0.013 mole Br2 or 0.0025 mole I2."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve low product yields due to equilibrium limitations in thermal dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by not being equilibrium-limited, allowing for higher yields of olefins. The specific challenge with using oxygen lies in the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions, resulting in the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. However, by incorporating sulfur with other halogens like bromine and chlorine, an even more attractive process can be envisioned, potentially replacing some of the expensive halogens with inexpensive sulfur.

2. In the context of oxidant selection for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, oxygen presents a challenge due to its tendency to cause uncontrolled combustion reactions, leading to the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. By using sulfur in conjunction with halogens, the process becomes more controlled, offering a potential solution to the issues associated with using oxygen alone. The sulfur-halogen system allows for the replacement of expensive halogens with sulfur, which is significantly cheaper, thus reducing costs and improving economic viability.
