[1] "Much attention has also hcen given to the selective, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and alkenes to produce olefinic and diolefinic monomers."
[2] "In the latter process the main reaction is equilibrium limited and low pass yields are obtained."
[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, on the other hand, are not equilibrium limited since a thermodynamically stable product (H20) is usually formed along with the olefinic product."
[4] "However when oxygen alone is used as the hydrogen abstractor, in the presence of different catalysts, low product yiclds are ohrained due to the occrrence of uncontrolled corn- bustion rcactions with the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide."
[5] "A significant advance was made in the oxidative dehydrogenation technology when the Shell group of companies achieved success in the iodine promoted dehydrogenation of butene to butadiene."
[6] "Both the Shell and Pctro-Tex proccsscs allowed up to 709;) butadiene yields from butane and higher than 8 0 y o once-through butadiene yields from tnitenc."
[7] "Thc bottom curve in the figurc shows that the cqilibririin for the thermal dchydrogenatioii reaction lies greatly to the left of Equation ( I ) for all the tem- peratures indicated."
[8] "Reaction control is difficult in practice:"
[9] "Although the thermodynamic equilibria shown above arc for the usc of halogens in stoichiometric proportions, in practice the halogcn promoted reactions are carried out in the presence of oxygen and with far less than stoichionietric proportions of halogens."
[10] "This is because the halogen promoters are used in much less than stoichiometric quantities (0.0014.2 mole) and must therefore take part in the desired reaction over and over again to produce high yields of olefins."

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges due to low pass yields in equilibrium-limited reactions, especially when oxygen is used as the hydrogen abstractor. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a non-equilibrium-limited process that allows for the formation of olefinic products alongside water, avoiding the formation of harmful by-products like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection and managing the reaction under controlled conditions to maximize product yields.

2. In the context of oxidant selection, the use of halogens like iodine, bromine, and chlorine as promoters in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions allows for high yields of olefins compared to using oxygen alone. The effectiveness of these halogens increases when used in combination, leading to even higher yields. However, these halogens come with high costs and difficulties in recovery for recycling, making them economically risky for commercial processes. 

3. The use of oxygen in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions is problematic due to the occurrence of uncontrolled combustion reactions, leading to low product yields and the formation of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. This contrasts with the use of halogens, which facilitate reactions without the risk of combustion, resulting in high yields of olefinic products.

4. The use of sulfur as a promoter in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions offers a potential cost-effective alternative to halogens. Sulfur is significantly cheaper than iodine, bromine, and chlorine, making it an attractive option for replacing or partially replacing halogen promoters. However, sulfur's molecular structure requires high temperatures to achieve the reactive, diradical species necessary for efficient dehydrogenation, which can lead to thermal cracking reactions instead of desired dehydrogenation.

5. To address the challenges of using sulfur as a promoter, it is suggested to utilize the oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to regenerate sulfur in-situ. This approach aims to supply the reactive sulfur species needed for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, potentially replacing halogen promoters while maintaining high product yields. The feasibility of this replacement scheme depends on the development of suitable catalysts that can rapidly react sulfur with the hydrocarbon feed while minimizing the formation of inactive sulfur species.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临挑战，尤其是在使用氧气作为氢抽象剂时，平衡限制反应导致低转化率。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一个非平衡限制过程来解决这些问题，该过程允许形成烯烃产物和水，避免形成有害副产品如一氧化碳和二氧化碳。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和管理反应以最大化产品产率方面存在其自身的挑战。

2. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，碘、溴和氯等卤素作为氧化脱氢化反应促进剂的使用，与氧相比，在高产率的烯烃生成中提供了优势。这些卤素组合使用的有效性进一步提高，导致更高的产率。然而，这些卤素因其高昂的成本和回收困难而使商业过程经济上风险较大。

3. 相对于使用氧作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢化反应，容易发生不受控制的燃烧反应，导致低产率和二氧化碳和一氧化碳的形成。这与卤素的使用形成对比，卤素的使用能促进反应而不涉及燃烧风险，从而产生高产率的烯烃产物。

4. 硫作为氧化脱氢化反应促进剂的使用提供了成本效益高的替代方案。硫的价格远低于碘、溴和氯，使其成为替换或部分替换卤素促进剂的有吸引力的选择。然而，硫的分子结构要求高温才能达到高效脱氢所需的活性双原子硫物种，这可能导致热裂解反应而不是预期的脱氢反应。

5. 要解决使用硫作为促进剂的挑战，建议利用氢硫化物（H2S）的氧化再生硫的方法。这种方法旨在提供用于氧化脱氢化反应所需的有效硫物种，可能替代卤素促进剂的同时保持高产率的产品。实现这一替代方案的可行性取决于开发出能够快速将硫与烃基馈送物反应的催化剂，同时最小化形成无活性硫物种的形成。
