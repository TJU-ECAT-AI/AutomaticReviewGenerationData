1. Challenges in current propylene production methods primarily involve the low yields and equilibrium limitations encountered in thermal dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by not being equilibrium-limited, as a thermodynamically stable product (H2O) is formed alongside the olefinic product. This allows for potentially higher yields. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, including difficulties in reaction control and the requirement for halogen promoters.

2. The primary advantages of ODHP are its ability to achieve high yields without being constrained by equilibrium limitations. This is due to the formation of a stable product (H2O) alongside the desired olefinic products. The disadvantages include the need for halogen promoters, which can be costly and challenging to recycle, and difficulties in controlling the reaction under practical conditions.

3. In the context of oxidant selection, oxygen is preferred in ODHP because it facilitates the reaction at all temperatures and results in a highly exothermic process. Halogen promoters are used to enhance the reaction rates, especially iodine, which is found to be the most effective when used in sub-stoichiometric quantities. However, sulfur can be used as an alternative to halogens, offering potential economic benefits due to its lower cost compared to iodine and bromine.

4. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP are related to its practical application in the presence of halogen promoters. While oxygen promotes the reaction effectively, achieving high yields requires careful management of the reaction conditions, including the precise control of oxygen and halogen concentrations. The use of sulfur as a promoter offers a more economical solution, but its application requires suitable catalysts to efficiently convert sulfur vapor into reactive species.

5. The use of sulfur as a promoter in ODHP can significantly impact future processing schemes by providing an inexpensive substitute for halogen promoters. This could lead to substantial cost reductions, especially considering the high cost of halogen promoters like iodine. The feasibility of using sulfur vapor for dehydrogenation is hindered by its molecular structure and the need for high temperatures to obtain reactive species. However, the use of sulfur in conjunction with oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) could potentially supply the reactive sulfur species required for the ODHP process, offering a promising avenue for reducing promoter costs and improving economic significance.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括热解氢化过程中遇到的低产率和平衡限制。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过避免平衡限制来解决这些问题，因为形成的稳定产物（H2O）与所需烯烃产品一起形成，这可能允许更高的产率。然而，ODHP也带来了自己的挑战，包括反应控制困难以及对卤素促进剂的需求。

2. ODHP的主要优势在于它能够实现高产率而无需受到平衡限制。这是由于形成了稳定的产物（H2O）与所需的烯烃产品一起。缺点包括需要卤素促进剂，这可能成本高昂且难以回收，以及在实际条件下控制反应的困难。

3. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，氧气在ODHP中被首选，因为它在所有温度下促进反应，并导致高度放热过程。卤素促进剂用于增强反应速率，尤其是碘，当以亚摩尔量使用时，发现是最有效的。然而，硫可以作为卤素的替代品使用，提供经济上的好处，因为其成本远低于碘和溴。

4. 使用氧气在ODHP中的具体挑战与其在卤素促进剂存在的条件下的实际应用有关。虽然氧气有效地促进了反应，但要获得高产率，需要精确管理反应条件，包括氧气和卤素浓度的精确控制。硫作为促进剂的应用提供了经济解决方案，尤其是考虑到卤素促进剂如碘的成本高昂。然而，硫的使用需要合适的催化剂将硫蒸汽转化为活性物种。

5. 硫在ODHP中的使用可以显著影响未来的加工方案，提供一种廉价替代卤素促进剂的选择。这可能导致成本大幅降低，特别是考虑到卤素促进剂如碘的成本高昂。硫蒸汽用于脱氢的可行性受其分子结构和需要高温才能获得活性物种的限制。然而，通过氢化硫（H2S）的氧化使用硫，有可能为ODHP过程提供所需的活性硫物种，提供减少促进剂成本和提高经济意义的有希望途径。
