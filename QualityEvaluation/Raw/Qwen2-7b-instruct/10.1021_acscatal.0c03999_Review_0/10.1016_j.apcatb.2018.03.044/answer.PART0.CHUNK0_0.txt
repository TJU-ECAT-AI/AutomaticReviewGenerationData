[1] "The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production."
[3] "However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection."
[4] "The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous because it is abundant and inexpensive."
[5] "Nonetheless, oxygen-based systems face challenges such as the formation of coke deposits on catalyst surfaces, which can lead to decreased activity and selectivity."
[6] "Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in improving the performance of ODHP processes."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production.
2. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. However, non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高资本成本和丙烯选择性低。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更节能、更经济高效的丙烯生产方法来解决这些问题。
2. 在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂具有优势，因为氧气丰富且价格低廉。然而，非氧气基系统可能在避免催化剂表面沉积焦炭以及保持催化剂活性和选择性方面表现出更好的性能。
