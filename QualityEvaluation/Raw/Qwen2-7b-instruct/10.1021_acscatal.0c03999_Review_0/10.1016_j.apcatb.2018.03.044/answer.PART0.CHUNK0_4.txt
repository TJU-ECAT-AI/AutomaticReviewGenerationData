The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, low efficiency, and the use of toxic catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method. However, ODHP has its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning oxidant selection. Oxygen, when used as an oxidant, presents reactivity challenges leading to complex surface chemistry and catalytic behavior. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are being studied to enhance the performance of ODHP processes.
