The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, significant capital investment, and the utilization of hazardous catalysts. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides an alternative approach with reduced energy usage and lower capital costs. However, the ODHP process encounters difficulties in choosing suitable oxidants and creating efficient catalysts. When oxygen is selected as an oxidant, its reactivity poses a challenge, potentially leading to side reactions and product contamination. Researchers have explored supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts to mitigate these issues.
