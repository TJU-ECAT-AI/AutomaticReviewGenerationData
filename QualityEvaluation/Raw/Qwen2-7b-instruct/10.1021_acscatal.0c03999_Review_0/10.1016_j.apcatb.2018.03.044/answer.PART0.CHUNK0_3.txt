[1] "The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption required for the processes involved."
[2] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative route to propylene production with lower energy requirements compared to traditional methods."
[3] "However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection."
[4] "Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP can lead to higher selectivity and yield of propylene, but also introduces additional challenges."
[5] "One of the main challenges associated with using oxygen is the formation of water vapor, which can cause corrosion issues in catalysts."
[6] "Another issue is the potential for coke formation on the catalyst surface, which can reduce its activity over time."
[7] "Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts have been investigated for their use in ODHP due to their ability to mitigate these issues."

Propylene production methods often face the challenge of high energy consumption. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides a more energy-efficient alternative. However, ODHP has its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning oxidant selection. Using oxygen in ODHP can enhance propylene yield and selectivity but introduces challenges such as corrosion due to water vapor formation and catalyst deactivation through coke formation. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are being explored to overcome these issues.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是所需过程的高能消耗。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了与传统方法相比能耗更低的丙烯生产替代途径。然而，ODHP也具有自己的优势和限制，特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。使用氧气作为氧化剂在ODHP中可以提高丙烯的产率和选择性，但也带来了新的挑战，如由于水蒸气形成导致的催化剂腐蚀问题以及催化剂活性随着时间的推移而降低的问题。正在研究的K2O/WO3/Al2O3支持型催化剂旨在克服这些问题。
