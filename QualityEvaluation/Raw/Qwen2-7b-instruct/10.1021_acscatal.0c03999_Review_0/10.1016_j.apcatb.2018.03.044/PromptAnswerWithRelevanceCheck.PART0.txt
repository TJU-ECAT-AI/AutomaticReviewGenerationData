1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production.
2. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. However, non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, significant capital investment, and the utilization of hazardous catalysts. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides an alternative approach with reduced energy usage and lower capital costs. However, the ODHP process encounters difficulties in choosing suitable oxidants and creating efficient catalysts. When oxygen is selected as an oxidant, its reactivity poses a challenge, potentially leading to side reactions and product contamination. Researchers have explored supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts to mitigate these issues.

Propylene production methods often face the challenge of high energy consumption. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides a more energy-efficient alternative. However, ODHP has its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning oxidant selection. Using oxygen in ODHP can enhance propylene yield and selectivity but introduces challenges such as corrosion due to water vapor formation and catalyst deactivation through coke formation. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are being explored to overcome these issues.
