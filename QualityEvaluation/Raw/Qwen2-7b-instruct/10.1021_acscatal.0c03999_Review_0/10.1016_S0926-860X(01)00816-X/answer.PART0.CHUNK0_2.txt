[1] "However, there are a number of issues related to safety and process upsets that need to be addressed. Important objectives in oxydehydrogenation are attaining high selectivity to olefins with high conversion of paraffin and minimizing potentially dangerous mixtures of paraffin and oxidant."
[2] "Oxydehydrogenation employs catalysts containing vanadium and, more recently, platinum. Oxydehydrogenation at 1000 C and very short residence time over Pt and Pt-Sn catalysts can produce ethylene in higher yields than in steam cracking."
[3] "More recently, the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant for ethane conversion to ethylene has been investigated as a potential way to reduce the negative impact of dangerous oxidant-paraffin mixtures and to achieve higher selectivity."
[4] "Oxydehydrogenation offers substantial thermodynamic advantages and is an area of active research in many fronts."

Propylene production methods face challenges including low selectivity and potential safety issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially providing a more efficient method of producing propylene. By using carbon dioxide as an oxidant instead of hydrogen, ODHP can mitigate the dangers associated with oxidant-paraffin mixtures and improve selectivity. This process also holds thermodynamic advantages and is an area of ongoing research. However, the selection of the oxidant remains crucial, as using oxygen can lead to undesirable partial or total oxidation to CO and CO2, challenging the selective conversion of alkanes to alkenes.

丙烯生产方法面临挑战，包括选择性低和潜在的安全问题。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更高效的丙烯生产方式来解决这些问题。通过使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂代替氢气，ODHP可以减轻氧化剂-烷烃混合物的危险，并提高选择性。该过程还具有热力学优势，并且是正在进行研究的领域。然而，氧化剂的选择仍然至关重要，使用氧气可能导致烷烃部分或完全氧化为CO和CO2，这挑战了将烷烃选择性地转化为烯烃的能力。
