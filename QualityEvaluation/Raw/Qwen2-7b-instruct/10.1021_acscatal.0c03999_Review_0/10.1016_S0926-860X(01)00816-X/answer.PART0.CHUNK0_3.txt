[1] "The challenges in current propylene production methods include reaching high conversion levels while maintaining high olefin selectivity, dealing with the equilibrium limitations of dehydrogenation, and managing the formation of byproducts and coke deposits. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by removing the equilibrium constraint on conversion, as the formation of water instead of hydrogen effectively shifts the reaction towards higher conversions."
[2] "However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The advantages include higher conversion rates, the ability to produce propylene without the need for additional separation of hydrogen, and potentially lower capital costs due to the elimination of hydrogen processing. The limitations are mainly related to safety issues, such as handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions. Additionally, suitable conversion of paraffins and maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition are challenging."
[3] "Another limitation is achieving high selectivity to olefins, especially ethylene, from ethane and propane, respectively. To compete with steam cracking, the selectivity to olefins must be quite high, and catalysts must be found that can stop the reaction at the olefin rather than allowing it to proceed on to the oxides. Also, to avoid byproducts, the reaction must be carefully controlled to prevent cracking reactions and other unwanted byproducts."

Propylene production faces challenges such as achieving high conversion while maintaining olefin selectivity, dealing with equilibrium limitations, and managing byproduct formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by eliminating the equilibrium constraint on conversion. However, ODHP presents challenges such as safety concerns related to handling paraffin-oxygen mixtures, difficulty in converting paraffins without forming dangerous mixtures, and achieving high olefin selectivity to compete with steam cracking. To overcome these limitations, careful catalyst selection and reaction control are crucial to avoid unwanted byproducts and cracking reactions.

丙烯生产面临挑战，如实现高转化率同时保持烯烃选择性、应对热力学平衡限制以及管理副产品的形成。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过消除转化率的热力学限制解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP也存在挑战，如处理丁烷-氧气混合物的安全问题、在不形成危险混合物的情况下难以高效转化丁烷、以及与蒸汽裂解竞争时需要实现高烯烃选择性。为了克服这些局限性，关键在于精心选择催化剂和反应控制，以避免产生不需要的副产品和裂解反应。
