The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving high conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity to propylene, avoiding the formation of unwanted byproducts, and managing the thermodynamic equilibrium constraints inherent to dehydrogenation processes. Oxydehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by removing the thermodynamic equilibrium constraint on conversion through the use of oxygen, allowing for higher conversion rates and selectivity to propylene. 

One key advantage of ODHP is that it enables the direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking which can lead to the formation of hydrogen as a byproduct. This can potentially reduce costs associated with hydrogen separation and purification. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, notably the need to handle the mixture of propane and oxygen safely, especially at the specific compositions that can become explosive. Ensuring high selectivity to propylene, avoiding the formation of methane and other byproducts, and managing the oxidative reactions to prevent the formation of carbon oxides are critical issues.

In the context of oxidant selection, oxygen is chosen for ODHP due to its ability to displace the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards higher conversions. This allows for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. However, using oxygen introduces additional safety considerations and process complexities, such as the need for effective oxygen management and separation systems.

Regarding the specific challenges associated with using oxygen, the presence of oxygen can lead to oxidative reactions that are not desired in the production of propylene. These include the potential for oxidative degradation of the catalyst and the formation of undesired products such as carbon oxides. To mitigate these issues, researchers focus on developing catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene while suppressing unwanted oxidative reactions. This often involves optimizing the catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions to achieve high propylene selectivity.

In summary, ODHP offers a promising avenue for propylene production by addressing the limitations of traditional dehydrogenation processes. However, it also introduces new challenges in terms of safety, catalyst optimization, and process engineering that need to be carefully managed to realize its full potential in industrial applications.

主要的挑战在于当前丙烯生产方法如何在实现高转化率的同时保持高丙烯选择性，避免形成不必要的副产品，并管理脱氢过程固有的热力学平衡限制。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过利用氧气来移除转换约束，允许更高的转换率和丙烯选择性，以此解决了这些问题。

ODHP的一个关键优势是它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需通过蒸汽裂解，这可以潜在地降低与氢分离和净化相关的成本。然而，ODHP也带来了一些自己的挑战，特别是需要安全处理丙烷和氧气的混合物，尤其是在可能成为爆炸性的特定组成时。

在氧化剂选择的背景下，选择氧气用于ODHP，因为它能够将脱氢平衡向更高转换率的方向推动，从而更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。然而，使用氧气引入了额外的安全考虑和过程复杂性，例如有效管理氧气和分离系统的需要。

对于使用氧气的具体挑战，氧气的存在可能导致不希望的氧化反应发生。这些包括催化剂的氧化降解的可能性以及形成不期望的产品如碳氧化物。为了解决这些问题，研究人员关注于开发既能选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯又能抑制不希望的氧化反应的催化剂。这通常涉及优化催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件以实现高丙烯选择性。

综上所述，ODHP提供了一种有前景的方法来生产丙烯，通过解决传统脱氢过程的局限性。然而，它也带来了新的挑战，包括安全、催化剂优化和过程工程方面的挑战，需要仔细管理才能充分利用其工业应用潜力。
