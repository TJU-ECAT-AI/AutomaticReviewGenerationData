The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the equilibrium conversion limitation in dehydrogenation. This restricts the amount of propylene that can be produced at economically attractive conversion levels.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction. It allows for higher conversions without the need for high-pressure conditions, which can lead to higher efficiency and lower costs. 

ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. An advantage is the ability to handle mixtures of propane and oxygen safely, as the reaction conditions are designed to avoid explosive compositions. 

However, ODHP faces challenges in selecting the proper oxidant. Oxygen is the preferred oxidant due to its availability and low cost, but it also leads to the total or partial loss of hydrogen, which can have a significant economic impact. 

To compete with steam cracking, the selectivity to olefins must be quite high. This requires catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. 

Temperature control is crucial in ODHP. High temperatures promote the desired reaction pathways but can also lead to higher levels of coking and by-product formation. Finding the optimal balance is a challenge.

The use of oxygen in ODHP is advantageous over halogen-assisted dehydrogenation because it avoids the corrosion problems associated with halogens. However, managing the oxygen-propane ratio to ensure safe operation remains a critical issue.

Advancements in catalyst development, such as the use of monolithic structures and modified catalysts, have improved the selectivity and efficiency of ODHP. However, ongoing research aims to find catalysts that can operate closer to thermodynamic equilibrium while maintaining high selectivity and stability.

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods involves the equilibrium conversion limitation in dehydrogenation, which restricts economically attractive conversion levels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction, enabling higher conversions without high-pressure conditions. This leads to increased efficiency and reduced costs. 

ODHP offers advantages such as safe handling of propane-oxygen mixtures, avoiding explosive compositions. However, selecting the proper oxidant presents challenges. Oxygen, despite its availability and low cost, leads to hydrogen loss, impacting economics. 

Competing with steam cracking requires high olefin selectivity, necessitating catalysts that efficiently convert propane to propylene while minimizing byproducts. Temperature control is critical, balancing desired reaction pathways and coking formation. 

Oxygen usage in ODHP is preferable over halogen-assisted dehydrogenation, mitigating corrosion issues. Yet, managing the oxygen-propane ratio for safe operation remains a critical concern.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于脱氢化过程中的平衡转化率限制，这限制了在经济吸引人的转化水平下丙烯的产量。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过消除平衡转化率限制来解决这些问题，允许更高的转化率而不必使用高压条件，从而提高效率并降低成本。

ODHP的优势在于能够安全地处理丙烷-氧气混合物，避免爆炸性组成。然而，在选择合适的氧化剂方面存在挑战。尽管氧气因其可用性和低成本而被首选，但其导致氢气损失，对经济产生重大影响。

与蒸汽裂解竞争需要高烯烃选择性，需要催化剂高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少副产品的形成。温度控制是关键，需要平衡期望的反应途径和焦化形成。 

氧气在ODHP中的使用比卤素辅助脱氢更优，可以避免卤素相关的腐蚀问题。然而，安全操作时管理氧气-丙烷比例仍然是一个关键问题。 

催化剂开发的进步，包括多孔结构和修改，已经提高了ODHP的选择性和效率。然而，持续的研究集中在找到在高选择性和稳定性的条件下接近热力学平衡的催化剂上。
