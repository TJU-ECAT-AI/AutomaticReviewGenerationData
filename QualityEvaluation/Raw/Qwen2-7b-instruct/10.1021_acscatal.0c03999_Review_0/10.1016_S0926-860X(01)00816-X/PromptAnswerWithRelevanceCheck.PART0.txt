[1] "Oxydehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation can be considered in at least two different ways."
[2] "Use of oxygen to oxidize the hydrogen coproduct from dehydrogenation, and thus to displace the dehydrogenation equilibrium to higher conversions."
[3] "This approach has been used commercially in the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene as in the UOP Styro-PlusTM process or in the ABB Lum- mus/UOP SMARTTM process, but to date has not succeeded in the dehydrogenation of light or heavy paraffins."
[4] "Direct use of oxygen as a means of dehydrogenating, for example, ethane to ethylene."
[5] "Oxydehydrogenation has successful commercial applications in the conversion of n-butenes to butadiene (e.g. as in the Oxo-D process referred to earlier), but not yet for the production of ethylene or propylene."
[6] "Although less apparent, oxydehydrogenation also plays a role in the work done by BP Amoco, Asahi, and others to extend ammoxidation to the direct conversion of propane to acrylonitrile."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving high conversion rates while maintaining high selectivity to propylene, avoiding the formation of unwanted byproducts, and managing the thermodynamic equilibrium constraints inherent to dehydrogenation processes. Oxydehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by removing the thermodynamic equilibrium constraint on conversion through the use of oxygen, allowing for higher conversion rates and selectivity to propylene. 

One key advantage of ODHP is that it enables the direct conversion of propane to propylene, bypassing the need for steam cracking which can lead to the formation of hydrogen as a byproduct. This can potentially reduce costs associated with hydrogen separation and purification. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, notably the need to handle the mixture of propane and oxygen safely, especially at the specific compositions that can become explosive. Ensuring high selectivity to propylene, avoiding the formation of methane and other byproducts, and managing the oxidative reactions to prevent the formation of carbon oxides are critical issues.

In the context of oxidant selection, oxygen is chosen for ODHP due to its ability to displace the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards higher conversions. This allows for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. However, using oxygen introduces additional safety considerations and process complexities, such as the need for effective oxygen management and separation systems.

Regarding the specific challenges associated with using oxygen, the presence of oxygen can lead to oxidative reactions that are not desired in the production of propylene. These include the potential for oxidative degradation of the catalyst and the formation of undesired products such as carbon oxides. To mitigate these issues, researchers focus on developing catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene while suppressing unwanted oxidative reactions. This often involves optimizing the catalyst composition, structure, and reaction conditions to achieve high propylene selectivity.

In summary, ODHP offers a promising avenue for propylene production by addressing the limitations of traditional dehydrogenation processes. However, it also introduces new challenges in terms of safety, catalyst optimization, and process engineering that need to be carefully managed to realize its full potential in industrial applications.

主要的挑战在于当前丙烯生产方法如何在实现高转化率的同时保持高丙烯选择性，避免形成不必要的副产品，并管理脱氢过程固有的热力学平衡限制。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过利用氧气来移除转换约束，允许更高的转换率和丙烯选择性，以此解决了这些问题。

ODHP的一个关键优势是它能够直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，而无需通过蒸汽裂解，这可以潜在地降低与氢分离和净化相关的成本。然而，ODHP也带来了一些自己的挑战，特别是需要安全处理丙烷和氧气的混合物，尤其是在可能成为爆炸性的特定组成时。

在氧化剂选择的背景下，选择氧气用于ODHP，因为它能够将脱氢平衡向更高转换率的方向推动，从而更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。然而，使用氧气引入了额外的安全考虑和过程复杂性，例如有效管理氧气和分离系统的需要。

对于使用氧气的具体挑战，氧气的存在可能导致不希望的氧化反应发生。这些包括催化剂的氧化降解的可能性以及形成不期望的产品如碳氧化物。为了解决这些问题，研究人员关注于开发既能选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯又能抑制不希望的氧化反应的催化剂。这通常涉及优化催化剂的组成、结构和反应条件以实现高丙烯选择性。

综上所述，ODHP提供了一种有前景的方法来生产丙烯，通过解决传统脱氢过程的局限性。然而，它也带来了新的挑战，包括安全、催化剂优化和过程工程方面的挑战，需要仔细管理才能充分利用其工业应用潜力。

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the equilibrium conversion limitation in dehydrogenation. This restricts the amount of propylene that can be produced at economically attractive conversion levels.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by removing the equilibrium conversion restriction. It allows for higher conversions without the need for high-pressure conditions, which can lead to higher efficiency and lower costs. 

ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. An advantage is the ability to handle mixtures of propane and oxygen safely, as the reaction conditions are designed to avoid explosive compositions. 

However, ODHP faces challenges in selecting the proper oxidant. Oxygen is the preferred oxidant due to its availability and low cost, but it also leads to the total or partial loss of hydrogen, which can have a significant economic impact. 

To compete with steam cracking, the selectivity to olefins must be quite high. This requires catalysts that can efficiently convert propane to propylene while minimizing the formation of unwanted byproducts. 

Temperature control is crucial in ODHP. High temperatures promote the desired reaction pathways but can also lead to higher levels of coking and by-product formation. Finding the optimal balance is a challenge.

The use of oxygen in ODHP is advantageous over halogen-assisted dehydrogenation because it avoids the corrosion problems associated with halogens. However, managing the oxygen-propane ratio to ensure safe operation remains a critical issue.

Advancements in catalyst development, such as the use of monolithic structures and modified catalysts, have improved the selectivity and efficiency of ODHP. However, ongoing research aims to find catalysts that can operate closer to thermodynamic equilibrium while maintaining high selectivity and stability.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于脱氢化过程中的平衡转化率限制，这限制了在经济吸引人的转化水平下丙烯的产量。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过消除平衡转化率限制来解决这些问题，允许更高的转化率而不必使用高压条件，从而提高效率并降低成本。

ODHP的优势在于能够安全地处理丙烷-氧气混合物，避免爆炸性组成。然而，在选择合适的氧化剂方面存在挑战。尽管氧气因其可用性和低成本而被首选，但其导致氢气损失，对经济产生重大影响。

与蒸汽裂解竞争需要高烯烃选择性，需要催化剂高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，同时减少副产品的形成。温度控制是关键，需要平衡期望的反应途径和焦化形成。 

氧气在ODHP中的使用比卤素辅助脱氢更优，可以避免卤素相关的腐蚀问题。然而，安全操作时管理氧气-丙烷比例仍然是一个关键问题。 

催化剂开发的进步，包括多孔结构和修改，已经提高了ODHP的选择性和效率。然而，持续的研究集中在找到在高选择性和稳定性的条件下接近热力学平衡的催化剂上。

Propylene production methods face challenges including low selectivity and potential safety issues. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially providing a more efficient method of producing propylene. By using carbon dioxide as an oxidant instead of hydrogen, ODHP can mitigate the dangers associated with oxidant-paraffin mixtures and improve selectivity. This process also holds thermodynamic advantages and is an area of ongoing research. However, the selection of the oxidant remains crucial, as using oxygen can lead to undesirable partial or total oxidation to CO and CO2, challenging the selective conversion of alkanes to alkenes.

[1] "The challenges in current propylene production methods include reaching high conversion levels while maintaining high olefin selectivity, dealing with the equilibrium limitations of dehydrogenation, and managing the formation of byproducts and coke deposits. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by removing the equilibrium constraint on conversion, as the formation of water instead of hydrogen effectively shifts the reaction towards higher conversions."
[2] "However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The advantages include higher conversion rates, the ability to produce propylene without the need for additional separation of hydrogen, and potentially lower capital costs due to the elimination of hydrogen processing. The limitations are mainly related to safety issues, such as handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions. Additionally, suitable conversion of paraffins and maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition are challenging."
[3] "Another limitation is achieving high selectivity to olefins, especially ethylene, from ethane and propane, respectively. To compete with steam cracking, the selectivity to olefins must be quite high, and catalysts must be found that can stop the reaction at the olefin rather than allowing it to proceed on to the oxides. Also, to avoid byproducts, the reaction must be carefully controlled to prevent cracking reactions and other unwanted byproducts."
