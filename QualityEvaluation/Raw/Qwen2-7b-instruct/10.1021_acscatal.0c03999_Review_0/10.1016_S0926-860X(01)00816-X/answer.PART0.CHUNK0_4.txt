[1] "Oxydehydrogenation of ethane and propane as a route to ethylene and propylene, respectively, has the attractive feature of removing the equilibrium conversion restriction of dehydrogenation."
[2] "Challenges in oxydehydrogenation include handling mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, which can be explosive at certain compositions, suitable conversion of paraffins, which often is limited by maintaining a safe paraffinoxygen composition, and suitable selectivity to olefins."
[3] "Use of oxygen to oxidize the hydrogen coproduct from dehydrogenation, and thus to displace the dehy- drogenation equilibrium to higher conversions."
[4] "Efforts to increase propylene selectivity have centered in the areas of more selective catalysts at temperatures below 700 C, more selective cata- lysts and conditions at high temperatures, membrane reactors, and cyclic-operation reactors."
[5] "Selectivities to olefins,comprising primarily ethylene and propylene, can be obtained in selectivities of 5080%."
[6] "At a 1:1 propane:oxygen ratio, selectivity to propylene was 78% at 4.3% conversion of propane with cyclic op- eration compared to 55% selectivity to propylene at"

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane allows for higher conversion rates compared to traditional dehydrogenation processes, addressing the issue of equilibrium conversion limitations.

2. Challenges in oxidative dehydrogenation include managing explosive mixtures of paraffins and oxygen, ensuring suitable conversion of paraffins without compromising safety, and achieving high selectivity towards olefins.

3. Oxygen is used to oxidize hydrogen byproducts, shifting the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards higher conversion rates.

4. To improve propylene selectivity, researchers focus on developing more selective catalysts at lower temperatures, optimizing conditions at higher temperatures, utilizing membrane reactors, and implementing cyclic operation methods.

5. Selectivities of 50-80% for olefins, mainly ethylene and propylene, can be achieved under certain conditions.

6. Using a 1:1 propane:oxygen ratio, a selectivity of 78% for propylene can be obtained at 4.3% conversion of propane with cyclic operation, compared to 55% selectivity with mixed feeds.
