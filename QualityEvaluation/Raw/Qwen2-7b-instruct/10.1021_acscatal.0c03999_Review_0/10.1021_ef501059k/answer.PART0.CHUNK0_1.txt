[1] "The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption required for the cracking process."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses this issue by offering a more energy-efficient alternative."
[3] "However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations."
[4] "One significant advantage is the potential for higher propylene yields compared to traditional methods."
[5] "The specific challenges associated with using oxygen as an oxidant include its high cost and the risk of forming unwanted byproducts such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides."
[6] "These byproducts can lead to increased environmental impact and potentially reduced efficiency in the production process."

Hydraulic fracturing additives and the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide in shale gas refer to the use of substances during hydraulic fracturing processes to prevent or delay the release of hydrogen sulfide gas from shale formations. This is crucial for safety and environmental protection, as hydrogen sulfide is highly toxic and can pose significant health risks if not managed properly. The delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide indicates that the additives effectively suppress the generation or release of hydrogen sulfide until the well is safely drilled and operated.

液压裂缝化添加剂和硫化氢在页岩气中延迟出现涉及在水力压裂过程中使用物质以防止或延迟从页岩层释放硫化氢气体。这对安全和环境保护至关重要，因为硫化氢高度有毒，如果不妥善管理，可能会对健康造成重大风险。硫化氢的延迟出现表明，这些添加剂有效地抑制了硫化氢的生成或释放，直到井安全钻探和运行。
