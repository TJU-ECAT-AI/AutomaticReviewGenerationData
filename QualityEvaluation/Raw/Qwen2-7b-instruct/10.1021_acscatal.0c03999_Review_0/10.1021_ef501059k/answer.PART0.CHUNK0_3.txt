Hydraulic fracturing additives and the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide in shale gas are discussed. The main challenge in current propylene production methods involves high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions due to steam cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by providing a more energy-efficient option with reduced emissions. However, ODHP has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, especially concerning the choice of oxidant. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP could lead to increased energy consumption and raise safety issues.
