1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods involves high energy consumption and carbon emissions due to conventional processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by providing a more energy-efficient alternative. Yet, ODHP has its own benefits and drawbacks, especially concerning the choice of oxidant. One particular issue with using oxygen as an oxidant is the risk of hydrogen sulfide formation during the process.
