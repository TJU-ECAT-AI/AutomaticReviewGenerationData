<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydraulic fracturing additives and the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide in shale gas refer to the use of substances during hydraulic fracturing processes to prevent or delay the release of hydrogen sulfide gas from shale formations. This is crucial for safety and environmental protection, as hydrogen sulfide is highly toxic and can pose significant health risks if not managed properly. The delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide indicates that the additives effectively suppress the generation or release of hydrogen sulfide until the well is safely drilled and operated.

Hydraulic fracturing additives and the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide in shale gas pay are discussed in the literature. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is high energy consumption. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by reducing energy consumption compared to traditional methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant for ODHP has specific challenges due to its reactivity and potential for causing delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide production.

Hydraulic fracturing additives and the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide in shale gas are discussed. The main challenge in current propylene production methods involves high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions due to steam cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by providing a more energy-efficient option with reduced emissions. However, ODHP has its own set of benefits and drawbacks, especially concerning the choice of oxidant. Using oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP could lead to increased energy consumption and raise safety issues.

1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods involves high energy consumption and carbon emissions due to conventional processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by providing a more energy-efficient alternative. Yet, ODHP has its own benefits and drawbacks, especially concerning the choice of oxidant. One particular issue with using oxygen as an oxidant is the risk of hydrogen sulfide formation during the process.
