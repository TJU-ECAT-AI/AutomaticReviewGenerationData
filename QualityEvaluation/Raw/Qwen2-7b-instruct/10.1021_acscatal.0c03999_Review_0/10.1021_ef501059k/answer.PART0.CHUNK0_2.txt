Hydraulic fracturing additives and the delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide in shale gas pay are discussed in the literature. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is high energy consumption. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by reducing energy consumption compared to traditional methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, especially concerning oxidant selection. Using oxygen as an oxidant for ODHP has specific challenges due to its reactivity and potential for causing delayed onset of hydrogen sulfide production.

在文献中讨论了水平裂缝填料和页岩气支付中氢化物的延迟产生。当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是能耗高。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过降低与传统方法相比的能量消耗来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP具有自己的优势和限制，特别是在氧化剂选择的背景下。使用氧气作为氧化剂的ODHP具有特定的挑战，因为其反应性和潜在的氢化物产生延迟。
