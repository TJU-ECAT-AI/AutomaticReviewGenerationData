        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1002/cctc.201200913], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044], and [10.1021/cr5002436]. Challenges in propylene production are highlighted, emphasizing high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is proposed as an alternative, offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method with reduced environmental impact. The primary challenge in ODHP is the selection of an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, which can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is suggested as an alternative oxidant, offering advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties. A prospective outlook suggests exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, focusing on designing better catalytic systems that optimize product yield and propylene selectivity while mitigating the risk of further oxidation.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in propylene production. Future research might focus on optimizing the use of non-oxygen-based systems for enhanced performance in avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Additionally, developing advanced catalysts with tailored properties could significantly improve the efficiency of ODHP processes, especially when using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The integration of microwave synthesis techniques for enhanced incorporation of hetero-atoms, increased hydrophobicity, and improved thermal stability could also contribute to the development of more efficient and sustainable propylene production technologies.
