        The in-depth analysis of current propylene production methods reveals significant challenges, primarily revolving around high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. These issues are exacerbated by the environmental impact associated with conventional production techniques. In contrast, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents a promising alternative by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective route for propylene production. This method, however, introduces its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly concerning the selection of oxidants.

        Among the primary challenges faced by current propylene production methods, high energy consumption stands out as a major hurdle. The conventional methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. These processes often require high energy inputs and result in significant environmental impacts through increased CO2 emissions. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost, but it also poses risks such as process flammability and the production of unwanted byproducts like CO and CO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2), on the other hand, can be utilized as an oxidant in ODHP, offering potential benefits in enhancing propylene selectivity. However, the efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and the properties of the catalyst.

        To mitigate the challenges associated with ODHP, especially concerning the selection of an appropriate oxidant, researchers have explored the use of non-oxygen-based systems. These systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts have been studied for their potential in improving the performance of ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, characterized by its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, facilitates improved catalytic activity by enhancing substrate accessibility and promoting the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques further enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increasing hydrophobicity, and improving thermal stability.

        Looking towards the future, the potential of ODHP as an alternative propylene production method holds promise. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant and the development of better catalytic systems could significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity of the process, reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This would not only make propylene production more sustainable but also more economically viable.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggest that while ODHP presents several challenges, particularly in oxidant selection, it also offers a promising avenue for propylene production. Future research should focus on refining catalyst designs, optimizing operating conditions, and exploring innovative methodologies to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of ODHP processes. The shift towards utilizing more economical feedstocks, such as shale gas, and generating pure olefins without relying on costly FCC or steam cracking processes is expected to drive the adoption of ODHP technologies in the coming years. The integration of advanced materials science, such as the TUD-1 material, and the application of novel synthesis techniques could lead to significant advancements in propylene production, making it more environmentally friendly and economically competitive.

        当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高昂的资本成本以及丙烯选择性低。这些难题伴随着常规生产技术的环境影响而加剧。相比之下，丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）提供了一种有吸引力的替代方案，通过提供更节能且成本效益更高的丙烯生产途径。然而，该方法也引入了自身的一系列优势和局限性，特别是在氧化剂选择方面的挑战。

        当前丙烯生产方法面临的首要挑战是高能耗。传统的工艺，如蒸汽裂解和流化催化裂解，由于选择性和产率低而效率低下，导致了显著的环境影响，如增加的二氧化碳排放。在ODHP中使用氧气作为氧化剂具有优势，因为它既丰富又成本低廉，但也带来了过程可燃性的风险和产生不希望的副产品如CO和CO2的风险。另一方面，二氧化碳可以作为ODHP中的氧化剂使用，有可能提高丙烯的选择性。然而，ODHP过程的效率受到温度、压力和催化剂性质等因素的影响。

        为了解决与ODHP相关的选择合适氧化剂的问题，研究人员已经探索了非氧气基系统。这些系统可能在避免焦炭沉积形成、保持催化剂活性和选择性方面表现更好。支持的K2O/WO3/Al2O3催化剂已被研究用于改善ODHP过程性能的潜力。TUD-1材料以其独特的三维介孔网络结构而闻名，通过增强底物可接近性和促进表面钛富集层的形成，促进了催化活性的提升。微波合成技术进一步增强了异质原子的整合，增加了疏水性，并提高了热稳定性。

        从长远来看，ODHP作为丙烯生产方法的潜在可能性令人鼓舞。使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂和开发更好的催化剂系统可以显著提高过程的效率和选择性，降低能耗和二氧化碳排放。这不仅使丙烯生产更加环保，而且更具经济竞争力。

        整合理解和前瞻展望表明，尽管ODHP面临着选择氧化剂的挑战，但它也为丙烯生产提供了有前景的方向。未来的研究应侧重于改进催化剂设计、优化操作条件并探索创新方法来提高ODHP过程的效率和可持续性。向利用更经济的原料（如页岩气）、生成纯烯烃而不依赖昂贵的FCC或蒸汽裂解过程的转变有望推动ODHP技术在未来几年的采用。通过结合先进的材料科学，如TUD-1材料的应用和新型合成技术的运用，丙烯生产可能会实现重大进展，使其在环境友好性和经济性上更具竞争力。
