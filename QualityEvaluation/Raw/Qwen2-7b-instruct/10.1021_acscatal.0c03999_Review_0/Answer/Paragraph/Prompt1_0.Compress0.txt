Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K.
