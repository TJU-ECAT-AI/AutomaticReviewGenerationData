        The challenges in propylene production, as highlighted by studies, primarily revolve around high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene, as evidenced by references [1], [3], and [5]. These issues are addressed by the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which offers a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production, as stated in references [2] and [4]. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP, as noted in references [5] and [6].

        The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost, as pointed out in references [4] and [6]. Nonetheless, non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity, as suggested in reference [5]. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in improving the performance of ODHP processes, as detailed in reference [6].

        The primary challenges in propylene production include high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures, as described in reference [2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic constraints, as mentioned in reference [4]. However, ODHP faces challenges related to process flammability and poor product selectivity due to over-oxidation, as discussed in reference [3]. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant mitigates these issues by providing a safer and more readily available alternative to oxygen, as elaborated in reference [6].

        Chromium-loaded catalysts, with their activity determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface, are particularly effective in ODHP processes, as indicated in reference [6]. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface, as explained in reference [6]. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability, as described in reference [6].

        The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties, as acknowledged in reference [8]. This review has provided insights into the potential of ODHP as an alternative method for propylene production, emphasizing its advantages, limitations, and the role of oxidants. It has also highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate oxidants and optimizing catalyst properties to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP process.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: The advancements and findings discussed in this review suggest a promising future for ODHP as a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology. Future research could focus on developing novel catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high selectivity and efficiency. Innovations in oxidant selection and process optimization could lead to significant improvements in propylene production, potentially reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. The exploration of emerging fields such as nanomaterials, renewable energy sources, and advanced process control strategies could open new avenues for enhancing the ODHP process. Moreover, the integration of ODHP with other technologies, such as carbon capture and utilization, could provide additional benefits in terms of sustainability and resource management.
