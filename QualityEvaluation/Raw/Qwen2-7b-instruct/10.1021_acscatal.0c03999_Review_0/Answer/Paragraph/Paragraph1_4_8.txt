        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are explored to enhance the performance of ODHP processes. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages, especially in shifting the equilibrium to the product side and promoting dehydrogenation. However, the efficiency of the ODHP process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides a potential solution to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in propylene production, contrasting with the high energy consumption and environmental impact of current methods. Choosing an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

        Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in propylene production, contrasting with the high energy consumption and environmental impact of current methods. However, choosing an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, while carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.
