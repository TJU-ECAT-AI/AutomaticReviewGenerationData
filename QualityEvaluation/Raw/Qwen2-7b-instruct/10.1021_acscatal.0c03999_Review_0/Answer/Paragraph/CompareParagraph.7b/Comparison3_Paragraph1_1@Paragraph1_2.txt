They provide accurate, timely, and relevant information, propose feasible suggestions, and integrate interdisciplinary perspectives. While both articles perform similarly across most categories, they lack in the clarity of research methodology description, rigor of research design, and fluency of language expression. Therefore, neither review stands out as superior."
