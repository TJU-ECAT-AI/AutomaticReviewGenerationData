Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene with Soft Oxidants via Heterogeneous Catalysis

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene (C3H6) is a crucial organic feedstock for a large number of chemicals in the petrochemical industry. (1) However, it is currently faced with a serious supply deficit because of the rapid growth in market demand for C3H6 derivatives. (2) At present, propylene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts, as well as direct dehydrogenation of propane (DHP). (3) Yet, the dehydrogenation process suffers from two inherent drawbacks: (i) the endothermicity-induced thermodynamic limit for C3H8 conversion that demands high-energy input and (ii) the rapid catalyst deactivation because of coke formation. (4) Alternatively, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is attractive because of its exothermicity, which makes it free from the thermodynamic restraint at lower temperatures. (5) Presently, oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP. Though major progress has been made by using redox-active transition metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium (1,6) and molybdenum, (6) the presence of O2 can cause overoxidation of olefins to carbon oxides (COx), resulting in the inefficient use of the reactant and low process selectivity. (1,6) Most recently, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has emerged as an outstanding catalyst for O2&ndash;ODHP with high C3H6 selectivity (e.g., 79% selectivity with 14% C3H8 conversion at 490 °C) and well-suppressed overoxidation. (7) To date studies have mainly focused on low-temperature activity (8) and probing possible active sites and mechanisms, including surface oxy-functionalization, peculiar kinetic features, and radical chemistry in the gas phase. (9,10) Despite potential advantages, concerns of process flammability due to the presence of O2 exist and might impair practical implementation. (5,11) To address this issue, an alternative approach is to introduce soft oxidants to replace O2 for ODHP, such as CO2, NOx, and S-containing compounds, as well as halogen/halides. Furthermore, the combination of these soft oxidants in ODHP offers avenues to directly utilize them for chemical conversion to reduce or mitigate acid-gas emissions, thereby adding environment-sustainability-energy benefits to ODHP reactions. For example, an approach of H2-free CO2 conversion through the ODHP process using renewable energy could potentially help to reduce CO2 emissions. (12)
There have been several excellent reviews regarding ODHP with CO2 as an oxidant. (6,13−16) Most of them have concentrated on the feasibility of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant for multiple reactions but fewer focused on the details of the ODHP reaction. Also, there has been little covered regarding the development of catalysts for other soft oxidant-assisted ODHP. In addition, the growing “propylene gap” between market demand and productivity and the continuously increasing concerns of environmental burden motivate the need for developing alternative approaches using soft oxidants for sustainable chemical production. All of these factors necessitate a timely analysis and summary of the literature to highlight current progress in catalyst development for alkane conversion utilizing soft oxidants. (17) Therefore, the present Review describes state-of-the-art catalysts that have been developed for the ODHP reaction with soft oxidants and provides an overview of the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance by extrapolating the reported kinetic and characterization results. Major soft oxidants including CO2, N2O, and S-containing compounds, and halogen/halides are reviewed. Among these, CO2-/NOx-assisted ODHP reactions have been mostly studied, with significant efforts aimed at developing supported metal oxide catalysts including redox-type transition metal oxides (e.g., chromium, vanadium, and iron) (5,18−20) and main group metal oxides with nonredox property (e.g., gallium). (5) Catalytic performance has been found to strongly depend on the dispersion of active species and the nature of the support. (1) Based on the variation of these aspects, the roles of CO2 and N2O also differ among catalysts. (21−24)
In sharp contrast to CO2 and N2O, sulfur-assisted DHP and ODHP have not been well studied in the context of active sites, structure, composition, or reaction mechanism, despite these soft oxidants being potential promoters for the reaction. Additionally, sulfur compounds, such as H2S, are a common cocontaminant in natural gas. (25−27) Therefore, significant effort is needed to realize the feasibility of this chemistry. Recently, catalytic oxychlorination over metal phosphate (e.g., CrPO4 and FePO4) and rare earth metal oxides/oxychlorides (e.g., CeO2 and EuOCl) has garnered more interest, as propylene yields up to 55% have been achieved at 500 °C. Oxychlorination chemistry is found to be largely correlated with the ability of catalyst to oxidize HCl to molecular Cl2.
In the present Review, we start with a thermodynamic analysis of ODHP with various soft oxidants, then endeavor to cover the progress in ODHP with each soft oxidant, with emphasis on the following aspects: (i) the relationship between composition, structure, and catalytic performance, presenting the composition-induced molecular structure and active sites of catalysts in correlation with observed kinetic behavior; (ii) the influence of the nature of the support and its acidity on the activity and selectivity; and (iii) mechanistic insights, using the relationship between catalyst composition, structure, and catalytic performance in conjunction with theoretical calculations to provide an overview of the working principles of ODHP reactions for different soft oxidants. In addition, this Review underlines various roles of different soft oxidants in these reactions, such as shifting reaction equilibria, reoxidizing catalysts, removing coke, serving as cocatalyst, and possessing competitive adsorption against C3H8. A perspective on future research opportunities is also provided at the very end.
2. Thermodynamic Analysis of Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Soft Oxidants
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
2.1. Thermodynamic Analysis
2.1.1. CO2&ndash;ODHP
For the reaction between CO2 and propane, as listed in Table 1, isotope-labeling experiments reveal the presence of parallel-consecutive reaction networks consisting of direct dehydrogenation (eq 2-1), reverse water&ndash;gas shift (eq 2-2), and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (eq 2-3). (28) As is well-known, one major advantage of O2&ndash;ODHP is its thermodynamic favorability due to its exothermicity (eq 2-11). (29) However, this advantage is no longer relevant in the case of CO2&ndash;ODHP because all major reactions are endothermic. One of the roles of CO2 is to shift the equilibrium of the ODHP reaction (eq 2-3) to the product side by consuming produced H2 via the RWGS (eq 2-2), thereby resulting in enhanced C3H8 conversion. (22) Meanwhile, dry reforming of propane (DRP, eq 2-4) can also occur and dominate in the same temperature range (Figure 1A). DRP is thermodynamically less restrained than dry reforming of ethane and methane. (12) Of note, since the CO2&ndash;ODHP reaction is a volume-increasing process, adding inert gas such as He and N2 allows a further enhancement of the equilibrium C3H8 conversion. (30) In relation to the effect of C3H8/CO2 ratios, a high CO2 partial pressure leads to higher C3H8 conversion, yet presents a detrimental impact on C3H6 production. (30) This stems from the existing competition between DRP and CO2&ndash;ODHP. Therefore, it would be desirable to kinetically inhibit DRP and improve ODHP, which becomes a major challenge in designing efficient catalysts for CO2&ndash;ODHP. (30)

Other side reactions, such as propane decomposition and cracking, as well as propylene decomposition (eqs 2-6&ndash;2-9), show less thermodynamic restraint and can readily occur, especially at higher temperatures. Among them, propylene decomposition (eq 2-9) is thermodynamically more favorable than propane decomposition (eq 2-6). (31) Undoubtedly, these reactions have negative impacts on activity and selectivity to the target product propylene at high temperatures in both ODHP and DHP. In addition, the decomposition reactions are one of the major causes of severe catalyst deactivation through coking, with the extent varying depending on the catalysts used. For example, the decomposition reaction (eq 2-7) dominates and causes severe deactivation in the case of Fe&ndash;Ce solid solution catalysts, (29) while the cracking reaction (eq 2-8) may occur on precious Pt catalysts. (32,33) Coke formation (eq 2-10) is one of the major causes of deactivation of the catalysts for CO2&ndash;ODHP. (34) This reaction is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature because of its highly positive Gibbs free energy. However, it becomes spontaneous starting from ∼400 °C (i.e., ΔG400°C = −6.5 kJ mol&ndash;1), resulting in catalyst deactivation in turn. In addition, propane hydrogenolysis (32,33) and CO2 methanation (29) are also reported side reactions during CO2&ndash;ODHP reaction on different catalysts, yet they are scarcely studied. These thermodynamic analyses highlight the critical role of catalysts in kinetically controlling these side reactions.
The reverse Boudouard reaction (eq 2-5) is a side reaction that has been extensively studied for CO2&ndash;ODHP. Its occurrence can aid coke removal, therefore inhibiting coking and improving stability. (23) This is considered one of the positive roles of utilizing CO2 as an oxidant and is discussed in detail in section 3.5.3.
2.1.2. N2O&ndash;ODHP
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is also a soft oxidant that has been used widely in ODHP. Two parallel reactions are involved, including N2O decomposition to O2 and N2 (eq 2-12) and the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction (eq 2-13). (19,35,36) As listed in Table 1, these reactions are exothermic and spontaneous at room temperature. Similar to O2&ndash;ODHP, this reaction route is free of thermodynamic restraint.
2.1.3. ODHP in the Presence of Sulfur-Containing Compounds
Sulfur-containing compounds can serve as either soft oxidants or promoters for ODHP reactions. SO2 is a potential oxidant for the ODHP reaction (eq 2-14), but the reaction is endothermic and not spontaneous at room temperature (Table 1). (37,38) In comparison to CO2&ndash;ODHP, SO2&ndash;ODHP requires less energy and becomes spontaneous at ∼300 °C (i.e., ΔG300°C = −2.1 kJ mol&ndash;1), lower than that for CO2&ndash;ODHP (i.e., ΔG700°C = −1.9 kJ mol&ndash;1). An alternative is to use S2 as an oxidant, and it can be generated/regenerated in situ with the introduction of H2S in the feed gas. (39,40) In this reaction, H2S partial oxidation to form S2 is the initial step (eq 2-15), followed by C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 with S2 being reduced to H2S (eq 2-16). Notably, the thermodynamic restraint of S2&ndash;ODHP is lower than that of N2O&ndash;ODHP (i.e., ΔG175°C = −0.4 kJ mol&ndash;1). Considering the exothermicity and spontaneity of H2S partial oxidation (Table 1), the S2(H2S)&ndash;ODHP reaction can readily occur in the temperature range that has been examined in the literature (400&ndash;950 °C). S2 can be regenerated through partial H2S oxidation to complete the reaction cycle. Inspired by the Claus Process in the industry, (41) the use of SO2 has been proposed to oxidize H2S for S recovery (eq 2-17), which does not pose a thermodynamic limit (Table 1). (42) Despite the thermodynamic feasibility of using molecular sulfur for ODHP, it presents problems because of the temperature sensitivity of sulfur polymorphs. To obtain reactive, diradical species S2, high temperatures (i.e., 648&ndash;800 °C) are required. (43,44) However, thermal cracking of C3H8 may occur at such high temperatures, making this reaction more challenging.
2.1.4. Halogen(X2)-Promoted ODHP and Oxyhalogenation
Halogens have been known as effective promoters for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. (45,46) As listed in Table 1, a halogen can react with C3H8 by abstracting hydrogen to form hydrogen halide (eqs 2-18, 2-20, and 2-22), followed by regeneration of the halogen via oxidation with O2 (eqs 2-19, 2-21, and 2-23). (43) Cl2-promoted ODHP (eq 2-18) is exothermic and spontaneous at room temperature; therefore, it is free from thermodynamic restraint. Br2-promoted ODHP is slightly endothermic but still spontaneous at room temperature (eq 2-20). Despite such difference, the thermodynamic restraint is negligible, as 100% C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield can be achieved starting from 25 °C (not shown here). Differently, I2-promoted ODHP is endothermic and not a spontaneous reaction at room temperature (eq 2-22). As presented in Figure 2A, the conversion and yield start to increase at ∼200 °C, gradually rise with temperature, and ultimately reach ∼100% at 1000 °C. Although Cl2-promoted ODHP is more thermodynamically favorable, the reaction is always fast and nonselective toward the formation of propylene, and there is a risk of explosion under some conditions. (47) On the other hand, I2-promoted ODHP suffers from limited recycling efficiency of expensive I2, hampering its industrial implementation. (47) By contrast, Br2-promoted ODHP is more feasible from a practical point of view, yet a high C3H8/Br ratio is necessary to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2. (47) As reported, the activity of the ODHP reaction in the presence of a halogen relies heavily on the ease with which the hydrogen halide is oxidized back to the halogen. (43) As presented in Figure 2B and 2C, clearly, HI oxidation is thermodynamically more favorable than the rest, rendering it an outstanding candidate among the halogens in the case of the halo-dehydrogenation reaction.
An alternative is to integrate the functionalization of C3H8 and the regeneration of halogen-based compounds in one step via propane oxyhalogenation, followed by the formation of propylene through dehydrohalogenation (eqs 2-24&ndash;2-29). (48,49) Dehydrohalogenation requires energy input, but these reactions possess no thermodynamic restraint as a whole, as the total reaction is analogous to O2&ndash;ODHP in eq 2-11. Besides, dehydrohalogenation becomes spontaneous at mild reaction temperatures, such as with HCl at ∼175 °C (i.e., ΔG175°C = −2.0 kJ mol&ndash;1), with HBr at ∼275 °C (i.e., ΔG275°C = −2.1 kJ mol&ndash;1), and with HI at ca. 300 °C (i.e., ΔG300°C = −1.1 kJ mol&ndash;1). Different to halogen-promoted ODHP, the evolution of a halogen via halide oxidation should be suppressed during oxyhalogenation, especially in the gas phase reaction, as it triggers undesired reaction paths including polyhalogenation, coking, cracking, and combustion. (50) In this context, HI is less favorable among halides in oxyhalogenation of propane, whereas HCl is a better candidate. This can also be reflected from the lower values in the changes of enthalpy and Gibbs free energy (Table 1).
2.2. Comparison between ODHP Reaction with Various Soft Oxidants
For ODHP reactions with various soft oxidants discussed above, O2-/N2O-assisted ODHP, as well as Cl2-promoted ODHP and oxyhalogenation, reactions are exothermic and spontaneous, leading to no thermodynamic limit. The remaining reactions including CO2-/SO2-assisted and Br2-/I2-promoted ODHP reactions are endothermic, whereas the later reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the former ones if the halogen regeneration reactions are taken into consideration. Between CO2- and SO2-assisted ODHP reactions, the former reaction is the least favorable, as CO2 is both thermodynamically and chemically stable.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052], synthesizing comprehension from [10.1002/cctc.201200913] and [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044]. Challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene, as highlighted in [10.1021/cr5002436]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution by reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, contrasting with the inefficiencies of conventional methods, as mentioned in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052].

        The main challenge in selecting an appropriate oxidant in ODHP, as per [10.1002/cctc.201200913], is balancing process safety and efficiency. Oxygen, abundant and inexpensive, is a common choice, yet it can lead to unwanted byproducts under certain conditions. Carbon dioxide (CO2), as a safer and more readily available oxidant, can potentially enhance propylene selectivity, as noted in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044]. However, the efficiency of the ODHP process, influenced by factors like temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties, remains a critical consideration, as detailed in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052].

        The use of bromine and iodine mixtures, with low iodine content, shows promise in improving propylene yield and selectivity, as demonstrated in [10.1002/cctc.201200913]. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in enhancing ODHP processes, as indicated in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044].

        In the context of the challenges and opportunities presented by ODHP, future research might focus on optimizing catalyst properties, improving the efficiency of CO2 usage, and developing novel catalysts that can operate at lower temperatures while maintaining high propylene selectivity and yield.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggest that the field is poised for significant advancements. With ongoing developments in catalyst science, novel materials, and process engineering, ODHP could become a viable and efficient alternative for propylene production, addressing environmental concerns while maintaining economic feasibility. The future direction might involve the integration of advanced computational tools for predictive modeling, the exploration of sustainable oxidants, and the optimization of operating conditions to achieve high propylene yields with minimal environmental impact.
