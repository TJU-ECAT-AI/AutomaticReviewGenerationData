    "Summary": "Both reviews excel in presenting comprehensive, accurate, and insightful analyses of the challenges and potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) in propylene production. They share strengths in topic relevance, information comprehensiveness, accuracy, innovation, and contribution to the field. While both reviews demonstrate strong structure and organization, the introduction and conclusion sections receive slightly lower scores. Both reviews effectively incorporate recent research, highlight current research hotspots, and maintain concise and fluent language. The practical application value and feasibility of proposed suggestions are well-addressed in both reviews. The critical thinking aspect, including logic of argumentation, multi-angle analysis, and identification of research limitations, is also handled competently in both reviews. Therefore, both reviews are equally superior in this context."
