    "Summary": "Both reviews excel in their content quality, structure and organization, academic standards, innovation and contribution, methodology assessment, timeliness and cutting-edge nature, writing quality, practicality and application value, and critical thinking. They provide comprehensive, accurate, and insightful analyses of propylene production challenges and the potential of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). While both articles are equally strong, they differ slightly in their approach to integrating interdisciplinary perspectives and proposing new research directions. Review A focuses more on the role of oxidants and the use of supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts, whereas Review B emphasizes the challenges and limitations of current propylene production methods and the potential of alternative oxidants. Both reviews are highly recommended for their contributions to the field."
