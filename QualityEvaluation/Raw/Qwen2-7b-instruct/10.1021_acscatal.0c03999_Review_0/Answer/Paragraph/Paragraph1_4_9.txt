        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are explored to enhance the performance of ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability. Carbon dioxide (CO2) as a soft oxidant can mitigate the issues related to process flammability and poor product selectivity due to over-oxidation in ODHP, providing a safer and more readily available alternative to oxygen. Chromium-loaded catalysts, with their activity determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface, are particularly effective in ODHP processes.

        Challenges in ODHP include the selection of an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, which can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, and the use of carbon dioxide as an oxidant, which can enhance propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties. Despite these challenges, ODHP presents an attractive alternative to conventional propylene production methods.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook suggests an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies in propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Future research might focus on optimizing catalyst properties, improving the efficiency of the ODHP process, and finding ways to effectively utilize CO2 as an oxidant. The potential for developing low-temperature, high-yield propylene technologies, as demonstrated by the use of bromine and iodine mixtures, holds promise for the future of propylene production. Additionally, the integration of advanced synthesis techniques, such as microwave synthesis, could enhance the performance of catalysts and contribute to the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production processes.

        当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高资本成本以及低丙烯选择性。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种更节能且成本效益更高的丙烯生产方法来解决这些问题。使用氧气作为ODHP的氧化剂具有优势，因为氧气丰富且成本低廉。非氧气基系统可能在避免焦炭沉积形成、维持催化剂活性和选择性方面表现更好。通过研究支持K2O/WO3/Al2O3催化剂来提高ODHP过程的性能。TUD-1材料因其独特的三维介孔网络结构而提供改善的催化活性，通过提供高底物可接近性和促进表面钛富集相的形成，从而增加钛的含量。微波合成技术可以增强杂原子的掺入、增加疏水性并提高热稳定性。

        ODHP面临的挑战包括选择合适的氧化剂，特别是纯氧，这可能导致形成不需要的副产品；以及使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂，这可以增强丙烯的选择性。ODHP过程的效率受温度、压力和催化剂性质等多因素影响。尽管存在这些挑战，ODHP仍然为传统的丙烯生产方法提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

        整合理解和前瞻视角表明，在丙烷脱氢催化剂领域探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究可能关注优化催化剂特性、提高ODHP过程效率以及找到有效利用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的方法。开发低温、高产率的丙烯技术的潜力，如通过溴和碘混合物的使用所显示的那样，对丙烯生产前景充满希望。此外，集成先进的合成技术，如微波合成，可以增强催化剂性能，并有助于发展更高效和环境友好的丙烯生产过程。
