        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052], synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1002/cctc.201200913], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044], [10.1021/cr5002436], and [10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3]. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is recognized as an attractive alternative to conventional methods for propylene production, offering a pathway that reduces energy consumption and CO2 emissions, in contrast to the high energy demands and environmental impacts associated with current production methods. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP. The use of pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2, whereas carbon dioxide (CO2) can be utilized as an oxidant with certain advantages. The use of CO2 as an oxidant has the potential to enhance the selectivity towards propylene, yet the efficiency of the ODHP process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        Challenges in current propylene production methods encompass high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly concerning oxidant selection. Oxygen, being abundant and inexpensive, is advantageous as an oxidant in ODHP. Non-oxygen-based systems might offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in enhancing the performance of ODHP processes.

        The challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. These issues are addressed by the shift towards more economical feedstocks, such as shale gas, through the utilization of ODHP. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has facilitated a shift from naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, leading to the establishment of ethane crackers and the dismantling or repurposing of naphtha crackers.

        The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant mitigates challenges related to process flammability and poor product selectivity due to over-oxidation in ODHP. This provides a safer and more readily available alternative to oxygen. Chromium-loaded catalysts, with their activity determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface, are particularly effective in ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability.

        An integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing new catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity, optimizing operating conditions for higher efficiency, and exploring novel oxidants that could further reduce energy consumption and environmental impact. The integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power, into the ODHP process could also significantly contribute to the sustainability of propylene production.

        从参考文献[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]进行了深入分析，并结合了[10.1002/cctc.201200913]、[10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044]、[10.1021/cr5002436]和[10.1007/s10562-017-2282-3]的综合理解。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）被看作是传统方法生产丙烯的有吸引力的替代方案，它能够减少能源消耗和二氧化碳排放，与当前生产方法的高能需求和环境影响形成鲜明对比。然而，在ODHP中选择合适的氧化剂仍然是一个重要的挑战。使用纯氧作为氧化剂可能导致形成如CO和CO2等不必要的副产品，而二氧化碳（CO2）作为一种氧化剂具有某些优势。使用CO2作为氧化剂有可能增强丙烯的选择性，但过程效率受到温度、压力和催化剂性质等因素的影响。

        当前丙烯生产方法面临的挑战包括高能消耗、高资本成本以及丙烯选择性的低。相比之下，ODHP通过提供更节能且成本效益高的丙烯生产方法来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP有自己的优势和限制，特别是在氧化剂选择方面。氧气因其丰富且价格低廉而在ODHP中作为氧化剂具有优势。非氧气系统可能在避免焦炭沉积形成、维持催化剂活性和选择性方面表现更好。研究支持K2O/WO3/Al2O3催化剂以提高ODHP过程性能的潜力。

        当前丙烯生产方法的挑战包括高能消耗、有限的平衡转化率以及高温下常见的副反应。这些问题通过转向经济型原料，如页岩气，通过利用ODHP得到解决。乙烷，一种相对便宜的天然气液体，促进了美国从基于石脑油的蒸汽裂解向乙烷裂解的转变，导致乙烷裂解器的建立和石脑油裂解器的拆除或再利用。

        在ODHP过程中使用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂可以缓解由过氧化引起的工艺可燃性和产品选择性差的问题。这为氧气提供了一个更安全、更易于获取的替代品。含铬催化剂，其活性取决于支持表面上铬物种的性质，特别适用于ODHP过程。TUD-1材料由于其独特的三维介孔网络结构提供了改善催化活性的能力，通过提供高底物可接近性和促进钛富集相在其表面的形成来实现。微波合成技术增强了异质原子的掺入、增加了疏水性并提高了热稳定性。

        总结与前瞻展望：考虑到文件中讨论的进展和发现，存在探索新兴领域和创新方法的机会。未来研究努力可能集中在开发具有增强活性和选择性的新催化剂、优化操作条件以提高效率以及探索能够进一步降低能源消耗和环境影响的新氧化剂。将可再生能源，如太阳能或风能，整合到ODHP过程中也将显著推动丙烯生产的可持续性。
