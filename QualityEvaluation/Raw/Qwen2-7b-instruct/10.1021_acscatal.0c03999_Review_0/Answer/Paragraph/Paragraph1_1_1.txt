        Challenges in propylene production primarily revolve around high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Current methods, such as steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking, are inefficient due to these factors. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution to these issues by providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. However, choosing an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP. Pure oxygen, for instance, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts like CO and CO2, whereas carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. However, non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in improving the performance of ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in propylene production, contrasting with the high energy consumption and environmental impact of current methods. However, choosing an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, while carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. Achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an attractive alternative to conventional methods for propylene production. The main challenge with current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and associated environmental impact. In contrast, ODHP has the potential to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP. Using pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages. The use of CO2 as an oxidant can potentially enhance the selectivity towards propylene. However, the efficiency of the process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.
        
        The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, along with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (shale gas) and producing pure olefins without the need for costly FCC or steam cracking processes. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has led to a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers either dismantled or repurposed.
        
        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an attractive alternative to conventional methods for propylene production. The main challenge with current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and associated environmental impact. In contrast, ODHP has the potential to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP. Using pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages. The use of CO2 as an oxidant can potentially enhance the selectivity towards propylene. However, the efficiency of the process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.
        
        The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, along with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (shale gas) and producing pure olefins without the need for costly FCC or steam cracking processes. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has led to a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers either dismantled or repurposed.
        
        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.

Using pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages. The use of CO2 as an oxidant can potentially enhance the selectivity towards propylene. However, the efficiency of the process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.
        
        The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, along with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (shale gas) and producing pure olefins without the need for costly FCC or steam cracking processes. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has led to a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers either dismantled or repurposed.
        
        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. The high availability of relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.

        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are explored to enhance the performance of ODHP processes.
