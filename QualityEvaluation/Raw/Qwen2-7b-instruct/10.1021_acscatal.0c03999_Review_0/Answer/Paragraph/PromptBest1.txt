Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1002/cctc.201200913], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044], and [10.1021/cr5002436]. Challenges in propylene production are primarily high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. However, selecting an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP, particularly with the use of pure oxygen leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages, especially in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in improving the performance of ODHP processes.

        Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. Achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in propylene production, contrasting with the high energy consumption and environmental impact of current methods. However, choosing an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, while carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene.

The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are explored to enhance the performance of ODHP processes.

        Propylene production faces challenges including high energy demands, low selectivity for specific olefins, and declining petroleum reserves, coupled with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by utilizing a more economical feedstock, shale gas, and generating pure olefins without the need for expensive FCC or steam cracking processes. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has led to a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers either dismantled or repurposed.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations. However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity. This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. The issue of CO2 emission has become one of the main subjects nowadays in the environmental chemistry. Interestingly, the CO2 as soft oxidant has also been reported to shift the equilibrium to the product side, and promote the dehydrogenation through the reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction. However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing new catalysts with higher propylene selectivity, optimizing the reaction conditions for ODHP to achieve higher yields, and exploring alternative oxidants that could improve the process efficiency and environmental compatibility. Additionally, the integration of ODHP with other green technologies, such as carbon capture and utilization, could provide a sustainable solution for propylene production.

Challenges in propylene production are primarily associated with high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene, as noted in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052] and [10.1002/cctc.201200913]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production, as highlighted in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044] and [10.1021/cr5002436]. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP, though advantageous due to its abundance and low cost, can lead to unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2, as observed in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. Carbon dioxide (CO2), on the other hand, can be used as an oxidant in ODHP with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity, as discussed in [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

        However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of pure oxygen can result in process flammability and poor product selectivity due to over-oxidation, as mentioned in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. The use of CO2 as an oxidant can potentially enhance propylene selectivity, but the efficiency of the process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties, as explained in [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

        Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity, as stated in [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044]. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in improving the performance of ODHP processes, as noted in [10.1021/cr5002436]. The challenges in current propylene production methods, such as high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures, are addressed by the shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, as reported in [10.1021/cr5002436].

        The integration of bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K), demonstrating a significant improvement over previous yields, as detailed in [10.1002/cctc.201200913].

        The potential of ODHP as an alternative method for propylene production, along with its advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection, highlights the importance of ongoing research in this field. The use of CO2 as an oxidant, despite its challenges, shows promise in enhancing propylene selectivity, and the development of better catalytic systems with high product yield and good propylene selectivity remains a critical area of focus.

        Future research endeavors might focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies to further optimize ODHP processes, taking into account the advancements and findings discussed in the file. This could include refining catalyst designs, optimizing reaction conditions, and investigating new oxidant systems to achieve higher propylene yields with reduced energy consumption and environmental impact.
