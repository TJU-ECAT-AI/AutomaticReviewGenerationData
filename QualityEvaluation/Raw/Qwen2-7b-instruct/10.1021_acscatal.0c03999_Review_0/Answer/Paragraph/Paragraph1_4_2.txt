        The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.
        
        Challenges in propylene production are high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, coupled with rising oil prices. ODHP tackles these issues by utilizing a more economical feedstock, shale gas, and generating pure olefins without the need for expensive FCC or steam cracking processes. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has led to a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers either dismantled or repurposed.
        
        Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields.
        
        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in propylene production, contrasting with the high energy consumption and environmental impact of current methods. However, choosing an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, while carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity.
        
        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an attractive alternative to conventional methods for propylene production. The main challenge with current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and associated environmental impact. In contrast, ODHP has the potential to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP. Using pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2.
