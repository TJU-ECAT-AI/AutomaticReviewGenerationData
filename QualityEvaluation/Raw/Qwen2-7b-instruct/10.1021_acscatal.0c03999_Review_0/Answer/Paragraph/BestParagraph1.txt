Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1002/cctc.201200913], [10.1016/j.apcatb.2018.03.044], and [10.1021/cr5002436]. Challenges in current propylene production methods are highlighted, including high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production, contrasting with conventional methods that rely on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, especially in the selection of an appropriate oxidant. Using pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, while carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an alternative with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant mitigates issues related to process flammability and poor product selectivity. Chromium-loaded catalysts, with their activity determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface, are particularly effective in ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability.

The potential of ODHP in reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions makes it an attractive alternative to conventional propylene production methods. However, designing a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity remains a challenge, particularly due to the tendency of formed alkenes towards further oxidation. This highlights the need for ongoing research to optimize ODHP processes and overcome existing limitations.

Looking ahead, the field is poised for advancements in catalyst development, oxidant selection, and process optimization, paving the way for more efficient and environmentally friendly propylene production. Future research might focus on exploring novel catalyst materials, refining process conditions, and developing innovative methodologies to enhance propylene yield and selectivity.

In conclusion, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a promising avenue for propylene production, addressing key challenges in current methods while presenting its own set of opportunities and hurdles. With continued innovation and research, the potential for ODHP to revolutionize the propylene industry is significant.
