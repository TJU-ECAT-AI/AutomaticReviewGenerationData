Light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are critical components in the chemical industry due to their widespread use as building blocks. The proposed or ongoing installations will utilize either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts, which have been developed to the stage where they can operate continuously for several years. Although current dehydrogenation technologies have made progress, there is still room for improvement, necessitating further developments aimed at reducing noble metal usage, enhancing catalyst stability, and/or optimizing energy efficiency in the dehydrogenation process.
