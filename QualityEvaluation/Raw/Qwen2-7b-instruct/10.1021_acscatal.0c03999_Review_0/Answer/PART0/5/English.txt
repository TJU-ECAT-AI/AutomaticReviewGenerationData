Light olefins, including propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are crucial compounds in the chemical industry due to their extensive use as building blocks. Over the past years, the demand for these components has shown steady growth, with all major markets experiencing positive trends in demand and production, except for the Eurozone, owing to the consequences of recent economic downturns. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely dictated by the price gap between propane and propylene, resulting in highly favorable market conditions.
