The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and significant greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative compared to traditional methods. Oxygen, due to its low cost and abundance, is commonly used as an oxidant; however, its application presents challenges such as the formation of carbon monoxide and the need for high temperatures. Specific challenges with using oxygen include the requirement for a stable catalyst system capable of enduring harsh conditions and the risk of catalyst deactivation.

The profitability of propane dehydrogenation largely hinges on the price disparity between propane and propylene, creating favorable market conditions. The demand for these foundational components has steadily grown over the past years, with all major markets experiencing positive growth in demand and production, except for the Eurozone, due to the aftermath of recent economic downturns. In the past few years, numerous new PDH projects have been announced, with proposed or ongoing installations utilizing either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts.

Various transition metals, including vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and others supported on carriers like metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites, have been studied for more effective catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, such as propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, lack of catalyst regeneration need, and avoidance of thermodynamic limitations. However, the presence of oxygen in the ODH process can lead to process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation, resulting in poor selectivity. This issue can be addressed by using a safer, milder, and more readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant. It is known that the catalytic activity of chromium-loaded catalysts depends on the nature of chromium species on the support surface. The TUD-1 material, featuring a unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure synthesized using a non-template method with a cheap structure directing agent, triethanolamine (TEA), has garnered attention as an interesting porous material. The enhanced catalytic activity of Ti-TUD-1 is attributed to the high accessibility of the substrate to catalytic active sites provided by the three-dimensional mesopore system and the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on the surface of the mesopore walls. Microwave synthesis techniques facilitate the relatively easy incorporation of hetero-atoms into zeolitic frameworks, increasing hydrophobicity, and improving thermal stability compared to hydrothermally synthesized materials. The UVvis DRS measurements of the synthesized samples were conducted under ambient conditions, and the spectra are depicted in Figure 3. The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts, along with the amount of coke formed, are shown in Table 2. The decrease in surface area and pore volume is more pronounced in samples with higher chromium loading (7 and 9%), suggesting that the pores may have coke deposits on the metal surfaces trapped within the pores.
