          The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in propylene production, contrasting with the high energy consumption and environmental impact of current methods. However, choosing an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, while carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

          The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and significant greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative compared to traditional methods. Oxygen, due to its low cost and abundance, is commonly used as an oxidant; however, its application presents challenges such as the formation of carbon monoxide and the need for high temperatures. Specific challenges with using oxygen include the requirement for a stable catalyst system capable of enduring harsh conditions and the risk of catalyst deactivation.
