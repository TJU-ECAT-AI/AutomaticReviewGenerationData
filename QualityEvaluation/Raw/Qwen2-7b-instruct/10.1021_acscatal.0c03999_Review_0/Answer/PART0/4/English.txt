The rise in demand, particularly from the automotive sector, coupled with a reduction in supply due to high naphtha cracking costs, has led to significant increases in butadiene prices. This has consequently spurred investments in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) facilities in the US, China, and Japan. As of 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced using deliberate techniques, whereas fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking dominated propylene production.
