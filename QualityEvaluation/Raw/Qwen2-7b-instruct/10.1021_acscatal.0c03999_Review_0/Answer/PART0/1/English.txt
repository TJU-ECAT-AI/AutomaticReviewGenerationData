The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potential solution to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions in propylene production, contrasting with the high energy consumption and environmental impact of current methods. However, choosing an appropriate oxidant, particularly pure oxygen, can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, while carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used with potential advantages in enhancing propylene selectivity. The efficiency of the ODHP process is influenced by various factors including temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties.

Propylene production traditionally relies on steam cracking and fluidic catalytic cracking processes, which are inefficient due to low selectivity and yields. Propane dehydrogenation is considered an attractive alternative due to its potential for high propylene selectivity and low capital costs, independent of naphtha prices. However, achieving high conversion rates necessitates extremely high temperatures, typically around 1000K. Commercial processes like the Catofin and Oleflex methods have been developed, but they still face limitations, including low propylene yields. Iodine-based oxidative dehydrogenation is highly selective but requires high temperatures and is costly. Bromine, while more reactive, lacks selectivity. By combining bromine and iodine in a mixture with low iodine content, the study achieves up to 80% single-pass yield of C3H6+C3H7X at moderate temperatures, below 800K. This represents a significant improvement over previous yields and holds promise for developing a low-temperature, high-yield propylene technology.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous due to its abundance and low cost. Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity. Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are explored to enhance the performance of ODHP processes.

Propylene production faces challenges including high energy demands, low selectivity for specific olefins, and declining petroleum reserves, coupled with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by utilizing a more economical feedstock, shale gas, and generating pure olefins without the need for expensive FCC or steam cracking processes. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has led to a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers either dismantled or repurposed.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy requirements, catalyst regeneration needs, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process, eliminating the need for catalyst regeneration, and overcoming thermodynamic constraints. However, ODHP faces challenges related to process flammability and poor product selectivity due to over-oxidation. The use of carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant mitigates these issues by providing a safer and more readily available alternative to oxygen. Chromium-loaded catalysts, with their activity determined by the nature of chromium species on the support surface, are particularly effective in ODHP processes. The TUD-1 material, due to its unique three-dimensional mesoporous network structure, offers improved catalytic activity by providing high substrate accessibility and facilitating the formation of a titanium-enriched phase on its surface. Microwave synthesis techniques enhance the incorporation of hetero-atoms, increase hydrophobicity, and improve thermal stability.
