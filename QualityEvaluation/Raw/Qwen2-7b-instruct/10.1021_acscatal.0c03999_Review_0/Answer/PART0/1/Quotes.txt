          [7] "Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (900K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment."
          [8] "Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br."
          [9] "We show that the use of bromineiodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20%) results in up to 80% of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800K)."

[1] "The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and low selectivity to propylene."
          [2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and cost-effective method for propylene production."
          [3] "However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection."
          [4] "The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP is advantageous because it is abundant and inexpensive."
          [5] "Non-oxygen-based systems may offer better performance in terms of avoiding coke deposit formation and maintaining catalyst activity and selectivity."
          [6] "Supported K2O/WO3/Al2O3 catalysts are studied for their potential in improving the performance of ODHP processes."

[1] "The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, along with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (shale gas) and producing pure olefins without the need for costly FCC or steam cracking processes."
          [2] "The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [3] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."

"[1] Propylene is one of the most important feed stocks in the chemical and petrochemical industries. It is a versatile starting material for synthesis of numerous commodity chemicals ranging from small molecules (isopropanol, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, butyraldehyde, and cumene) to very complex molecules (polypropylene, plastics, and paints)."
          "[2] Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides a favorable alternative due to its low energy requirement, no catalyst regeneration obligation, and the elimination of thermodynamic limitations."
          "[3] However, the presence of O2 in the ODH process may lead to the process flammability and the production of carbon oxides due to over-oxidation resulting in poor process selectivity."
          "[4] This problem can be solved by employing a much safer, milder, and readily available carbon dioxide as a soft oxidant."
          "[5] As known, the issue of CO2 emission has become one of the main subjects nowadays in the environmental chemistry."
          "[6] Interestingly, the CO2 as soft oxidant has also been reported to shift the equilibrium to the product side, and promote the dehydrogenation through the reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
          "[7] However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation."

[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an attractive alternative to conventional methods for propylene production."
          [2] "The main challenge with current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and associated environmental impact."
          [3] "In contrast, ODHP has the potential to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions."
          [4] "However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP."
          [5] "Using pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2."
          [6] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages."
          [7] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant can potentially enhance the selectivity towards propylene."
          [8] "However, the efficiency of the process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties."

[1] "Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC)."
          [2] "However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low."
          [3] "Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price."
          [4] "However, very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion."
          [5] "Despite these disadvantages, several propane dehydrogenation processes have been commercialized, including the Catofin process developed by Lummus and the Oleflex process developed by UOP."
          [6] "The highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30%, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products."
