[1] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."

[4] "The reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciably increase in selectivity per pass is noticed."
[5] "The addition of SO2 to the feed increases the conversion of propane ; however,the selectivities to propylene are far below those obtained with pure propane feed (see Table 1)."
[6] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions, however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."
[7] "On the other hand,the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods often involve achieving high yields and selectivities while maintaining efficiency under various operating conditions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient method for propylene production. This technique can potentially bypass the equilibrium limitations of traditional methods, leading to increased propylene yields. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. The selection of the oxidant, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2), plays a crucial role in determining the performance of the process. While SO2 can enhance the conversion of propane, it does not necessarily improve the selectivity or activity of the catalyst over the reduced state.

Advantages of using Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in ODHP include their ability to offer higher selectivity to propylene, especially at high temperatures where appreciable increases in selectivity per pass can be observed. This makes Pd/Al2O3 a promising alternative to conventional Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O dehydrogenation catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations. However, the oxidative dehydrogenation using SO2 also presents challenges, such as the potential for propylene to be oxidized by SO2, leading to the formation of water and carbon dioxide. This could lower the selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 to propylene.

The use of sulfur dioxide as an oxidant in ODHP might seem counterintuitive, as it can abstract hydrogen from the alkane, resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulfide and water. This behavior is consistent with the observed low selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 to propylene, which could be attributed to propylene being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide. The presence of CO2 in the reaction products supports this view, indicating that sulfur dioxide might play a dual role in the reaction mechanism, enhancing conversion while also affecting selectivity negatively.

In summary, while oxidative dehydrogenation of propane offers a viable alternative to traditional methods for propylene production, the selection of oxidants and understanding the reaction mechanisms remain critical factors in optimizing the process for maximum efficiency and selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战通常涉及在各种操作条件下实现高产量和选择性。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种可能更有效的丙烯生产方法来解决这些问题，该技术有可能绕过传统方法的平衡限制，从而提高丙烯产量。然而，ODHP具有自身的一系列优势和限制。氧化剂的选择，特别是二氧化硫（SO2），在确定过程性能中起着关键作用。

使用Pd/Al2O3催化剂在ODHP中的优点包括其在高温下提供更高丙烯选择性的能力，其中每通过一次反应可以获得显著增加的选择性。这使得Pd/Al2O3成为与常规Cr2O3-Al2O3-K2O脱氢催化剂相比的有希望的替代品，特别是在高温操作中。然而，使用SO2作为氧化剂的ODHP也带来了挑战，例如丙烯可能被SO2氧化，导致水和二氧化碳的形成。这可能会降低Pd/Al2O3对丙烯的选择性。

在ODHP中使用二氧化硫作为一种氧化剂可能看似不合逻辑，因为它可以从烷烃中提取氢，导致生成氢硫酸和水。这种行为与观察到的Pd/Al2O3对丙烯低选择性一致，可以归因于丙烯被SO2氧化为水和二氧化碳。反应产物中出现的CO2支持这一观点，表明SO2可能在反应机制中扮演双重角色，在增强转化率的同时也影响选择性。

总之，尽管氧化脱氢丙烷提供了丙烯生产的一种可行替代方法，但选择氧化剂和理解反应机制仍然是优化过程以实现最大效率和选择性的关键因素。
