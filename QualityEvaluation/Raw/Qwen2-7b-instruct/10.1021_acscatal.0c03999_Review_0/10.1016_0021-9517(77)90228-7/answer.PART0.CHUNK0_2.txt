[1] "The present work is an investigation of the system propane-sulfur dioxide over Id/A1203 catalyst in the reduced and sulfided states."
[2] "Pd/ALOs was chosen because of the remarkable high yield and selectivity to propylene formation resulting from the dehydrogenation of propane (1)."
[3] "The overall reaction for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with SO2 can be written as 3CJZ3 + so2 * 3GHs + H&J + 2HzO."
[4] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[5] "After the weighed quantity of catalyst has been introduced into the reactor, the latter was flushed with Nz at a flow rate of 100 ml/min to eliminate oxygen."
[6] "The products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Tables 1 and 2)."
[7] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was first investigated on the reduced and sulfided 0.5% Pd/ALOs catalysts."
[8] "Sulfiding palladium catalyst did not improve activity or selectivity."
[9] "The reduced Pd/A1203 catalyst offers some advantages over the conventional Crz03-A120rK30 dehydrogenation catalyst, especially in high temperature operations in which appreciable increase in selectivity per pass is noticed."
[10] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions, however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."
[11] "On the other hand, the relatively low selectivity of Pd/Al,Os to propylene could result from the latter being oxidized by SO2 to water and carbon dioxide."
[12] "The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include achieving high yields and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially increasing the yield and selectivity of propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One advantage is that it allows for overcoming the equilibrium limitations of the reaction. Palladium catalysts, such as Pd/Al2O3, offer some hope in this context. The limitations include the fact that sulfiding the catalyst does not improve its activity or selectivity. Furthermore, the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as an oxidant in the process may lead to the oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, reducing its selectivity. Despite these limitations, the potential benefits of ODHP suggest it could be a viable alternative in propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括在丙烷脱氢过程中实现高产率和选择性。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过可能提高丙烯产量和选择性来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP具有自己的优势和限制。一个优势是它能够克服反应的平衡限制。钯催化剂，如Pd/Al2O3，在这方面显示出希望。限制包括硫化催化剂并不能改善其活性或选择性。此外，在过程中使用二氧化硫（SO2）作为氧化剂可能导致丙烯被氧化为水和二氧化碳，从而降低其选择性。尽管存在这些限制，ODHP的潜在益处表明它可能是丙烯生产的一个可行替代方案。
