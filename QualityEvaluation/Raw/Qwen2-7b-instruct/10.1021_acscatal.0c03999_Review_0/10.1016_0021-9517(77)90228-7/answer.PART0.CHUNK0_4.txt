1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is achieving higher yields and selectivity, especially overcoming equilibrium limitations in the reaction. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially increasing the yield and selectivity of propylene production. It presents its own set of advantages, such as improved selectivity at high temperatures, and limitations, including the potential for lower propylene selectivity due to oxidation reactions. The choice of oxidant, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2), plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of the process. The use of palladium on aluminum oxide (Pd/AL2O3) catalysts offers hope in terms of selectivity and activity, although the sulfiding process did not improve these properties compared to the reduced catalyst.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) method specifically uses sulfur dioxide (SO2) as the oxidant. This choice of oxidant helps to overcome equilibrium limitations by increasing the conversion of propane to propylene. However, the use of SO2 also introduces the challenge of managing the side reactions, such as the oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, which can reduce propylene selectivity. The Pd/AL2O3 catalyst, when used in the reduced state, shows advantages over conventional chromium oxide-aluminum oxide-kalium oxide catalysts, particularly in high-temperature operations where a significant increase in selectivity per pass can be observed.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于提高产率和选择性，尤其是克服反应的平衡限制。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过可能增加丙烯产率和选择性来解决这些问题。它具有在高温下提高选择性的优势，并且存在一些局限性，特别是由于氧化反应可能导致丙烯选择性降低。选择氧化剂，特别是二氧化硫（SO2），对确定过程效率至关重要。使用钯在氧化铝（Pd/AL2O3）催化剂可以带来希望，特别是在选择性和活性方面，尽管硫化过程并未改善与还原催化剂相比的这些性质。

2. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）方法特别使用二氧化硫（SO2）作为氧化剂。这种氧化剂的选择有助于克服平衡限制，通过增加丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率。然而，使用SO2也引入了管理副反应的挑战，例如丙烯氧化为水和二氧化碳，这会降低丙烯的选择性。当使用Pd/AL2O3催化剂时，在还原状态下显示了比常规铬氧化铝-氧化铝-钾氧化物催化剂的优势，尤其是在高温操作中，每次通过可以获得显著的选择性提高。
