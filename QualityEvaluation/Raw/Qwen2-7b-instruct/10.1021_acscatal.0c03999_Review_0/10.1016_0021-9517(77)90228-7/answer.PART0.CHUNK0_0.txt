[1] "Previous studies (2) have shown that the above reaction is endothermic and that Kp increases with temperature."
[2] "The reduced Pd/ALOs is clearly superior to the sulfided catalyst. It shows a moderate activity as can be seen from conversion data, and high selectivity to propylene at temperatures as high as 611C."
[3] "Sulfiding Pd/AlzOs did not,therefore,improve activity or selectivity over the reduced catalyst."
[4] "On the other hand,sulfided Pd/A1203 catalyst shows poor activity although its selectivity was fairly high (71%)."
[5] "Although it is premature at this stage to give some insight into the mechanisms of these reactions,however, SOZ seems to abstract hydrogen from the alkane with the result that hydrogen sulfide and water are formed."
[6] "These were detected by glc analysis."
[7] "The presence of COZ among the reaction products seems to support this view."

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods involves the equilibrium limitation of the reaction, leading to low yields and selectivities. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially increasing the selectivity and yield through a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One key advantage is the ability to operate at higher temperatures, which can lead to increased selectivity per pass. A limitation is the need for careful oxidant selection, as using oxygen can lead to additional side reactions, such as the oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide.

2. In the context of oxidant selection, using sulfur dioxide (SO2) in ODHP offers an alternative to overcome the equilibrium limitation of the reaction. This approach can improve propylene yield and selectivity compared to conventional methods. The specific mechanism involves SO2 abstracting hydrogen from the alkane, resulting in the formation of hydrogen sulfide and water. The presence of CO2 in the reaction products supports this view, indicating that propylene might be oxidized under certain conditions.

3. The use of palladium on aluminum oxide (Pd/Al2O3) catalysts in ODHP presents some advantages over conventional chromium-based catalysts, especially in high-temperature operations. At higher temperatures, the reduced Pd/Al2O3 catalyst shows higher activity and selectivity for propylene formation, compared to the sulfided catalyst. This suggests that maintaining the catalyst in the reduced state might offer better performance for propylene production.

4. The oxidative dehydrogenation using sulfur dioxide (SO2) offers an alternative to conventional methods by addressing the equilibrium limitation of the reaction. Palladium on aluminum oxide (Pd/Al2O3) catalysts demonstrate potential in this process, especially when operated at high temperatures. However, the use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to additional side reactions, such as the oxidation of propylene to water and carbon dioxide, which negatively impacts the selectivity and efficiency of the process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于反应的平衡限制，导致产量和选择性较低。通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，并可能提高选择性和产率，通过更有效的丙烷转化为丙烯。然而，ODHP也存在自己的优势和局限性。一个关键的优势是在更高的温度下操作，这可能导致每次通过增加选择性。局限性在于需要仔细选择氧化剂，因为使用氧气可能导致额外的副反应，如丙烯被氧化为水和二氧化碳。

2. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，使用二氧化硫（SO2）在ODHP中提供了一种克服反应平衡限制的方法。这种方法可以通过改善丙烯产率和选择性来改进与传统方法相比。具体机制涉及SO2从烷烃中提取氢，结果产生氢化物和水。反应产物中存在CO2支持这一观点，表明丙烯可能在某些条件下被氧化。

3. 使用钯在氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）催化剂在ODHP中表现出一些优势相对于传统的铬基催化剂，尤其是在高温操作中。在较高温度下，还原的Pd/Al2O3催化剂显示更高的活性和丙烯形成的选择性，与硫化的催化剂相比。这表明保持催化剂在还原状态可能为丙烯生产提供更好的性能。

4. 二氧化硫（SO2）的氧化脱氢提供了传统方法的一种替代方案，通过解决反应的平衡限制。钯在氧化铝（Pd/Al2O3）催化剂在这一过程中显示出潜力，尤其是在高温下操作。然而，使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致额外的副反应，如丙烯被氧化为水和二氧化碳，这对过程的选择性和效率产生负面影响。
