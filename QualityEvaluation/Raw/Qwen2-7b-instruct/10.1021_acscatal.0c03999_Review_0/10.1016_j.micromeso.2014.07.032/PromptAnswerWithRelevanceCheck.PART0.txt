1.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an alternative oxidant, which potentially reduces the formation of carbon oxides. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Nitrous oxide offers a more selective route to produce light olefins, but the reaction mechanism with propane is less clear compared to reactions with dioxygen. The specific challenges include understanding the activation and conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, designing effective catalysts, and addressing the deactivation mechanism caused by coke formation on the catalyst surface.

2. Fe-ZSM-5 exhibits superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination process. It achieves a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1. The material is characterized by simple FeOAl species as the active sites, which contribute to its effectiveness in the ODHP process. Additionally, the absence of Brnsted acid sites in Fe-ZSM-5 makes it an ideal model catalyst for studying the ODHP with N2O, as it simplifies the reaction mechanism and facilitates the investigation of the reaction and deactivation mechanisms.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于过氧化导致大量二氧化碳（CO和CO2）的形成，这导致了低烯烃选择性和烯烃产率。通过将硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为替代氧化剂提出丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP），解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP具有其自身的优点和限制。N2O提供了更选择性的轻烯烃生产途径，但与使用氧气的反应机制相比，N2O与丙烷的反应机制尚不清楚。特定的挑战包括理解铁沸石上N2O的激活和转化、设计有效的催化剂以及解决由催化剂表面形成的焦炭导致的催化剂失活机制。

2. 在严重煅烧过程中，Fe-ZSM-5显示出在ODHP中使用N2O的优越性能。它在高转速下达到最大初始丙烯产率为30%，转速为0.037 s−1。该材料以简单FeOAl物种作为活性位点，这有助于其在ODHP过程中的有效性。此外，Fe-ZSM-5中几乎没有Brnsted酸性位点，使它成为研究ODHP与N2O的理想模型催化剂。这简化了反应机制并促进了反应和失活机制的研究。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve extensive over-oxidation of light alkanes, leading to low olefin selectivity and yield. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents an advantageous route for producing propylene by selectively converting propane with nitrous oxide (N2O) as an oxidant, avoiding the over-oxidation issues encountered with dioxygen. However, this process faces challenges such as unclear reaction mechanisms, complex interactions between propane and nitrous oxide on iron-zeolite surfaces, and the deactivation mechanisms related to catalyst surface contamination.

2. In the context of using N2O as an oxidant for ODHP, the primary advantage lies in its ability to reduce over-oxidation issues typically associated with dioxygen. This leads to higher olefin selectivity and yield. The limitation is the complexity introduced by the interaction between propane and N2O, which complicates the conversion process on iron-zeolite surfaces. Additionally, the deactivation mechanisms of the catalyst, including coke formation and deposition, remain poorly understood, posing a challenge to the development of more efficient catalysts.

3. The deactivation mechanism of catalysts in the ODHP with N2O involves the formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface, which is a common issue across oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, regardless of the oxidant used. However, the specifics of coke formation and its origin are not fully understood, hindering the development of effective strategies to prevent coke deposition and enhance catalyst lifetime.

4. Fe-ZSM-5 prepared using ferrocene as the iron precursor demonstrates superior performance for ODHP with N2O after severe calcination. This catalyst features isolated FeOAl species as active sites, contributing to a high initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s⁻¹.

5. Despite advancements in catalyst development for ODHP with N2O, several challenges persist. These include the need for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism, the complex interactions between propane and nitrous oxide, and the deactivation mechanisms associated with catalyst performance, particularly concerning coke formation and deposition.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于，轻烷烃的过度氧化导致烯烃选择性和产率较低。通过使用硝酸氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）来选择性地将丙烷与硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为氧化剂进行转换，为丙烯生产提供了一种有利的途径，避免了使用氧气时遇到的过度氧化问题。然而，在使用N2O作为氧化剂进行ODHP的过程中，存在反应机制不明确、丙烷和N2O在铁沸石表面的复杂相互作用以及催化剂表面污染导致的催化剂失活机制等挑战。

2. 在使用N2O作为氧化剂进行ODHP的背景下，主要优势在于能够减少使用氧气时通常遇到的过度氧化问题，从而提高烯烃选择性和产率。局限性在于丙烷和N2O之间复杂相互作用在铁沸石表面上的转化过程，这增加了催化剂活性位点的复杂性。此外，催化剂失活机制，包括焦炭形成和沉积，尚未完全理解，对催化剂性能的发展构成了挑战。

3. 催化剂在使用N2O进行ODHP过程中的失活机制涉及催化剂表面焦炭的形成和沉积，这是氧化脱氢化反应中普遍存在的问题，无论使用的氧化剂是什么。然而，焦炭形成的具体细节及其来源尚不清楚，这阻碍了有效策略的发展，以防止焦炭沉积并延长催化剂寿命。

4. 经过严重煅烧后，使用二茂铁作为铁前体制备的Fe-ZSM-5显示出在使用N2O进行ODHP时的优越性能。这种催化剂具有孤立的FeOAl物种作为活性位点，可实现高达30%的初始丙烯产率和高转动频率0.037 s⁻¹。

5. 尽管在使用N2O进行ODHP的催化剂开发方面取得了进展，但仍存在一些挑战。这些挑战包括需要更深入理解反应机制、丙烷和N2O之间的复杂相互作用以及与催化剂性能相关的失活机制，特别是焦炭形成和沉积的问题。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include over-oxidation leading to low olefin selectivity and yield when using dioxygen. These issues are addressed by oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which uses nitrous oxide as an oxidant, potentially offering higher olefin selectivity and yield. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One limitation is the complexity in understanding the reaction mechanism when propane reductant is involved. Another challenge is the lack of clarity regarding the specific nature and origin of coke deposits on the catalyst surface, which can lead to catalyst deactivation.
