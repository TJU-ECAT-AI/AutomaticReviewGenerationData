[1] "Light olefins are very important components for the petrochemical industry with increasing market demands in recent years."
[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield."
[3] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention."
[4] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
[5] "Formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the extensive formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) even at moderate alkane conversions when using dioxygen as an oxidant, leading to low olefin selectivity and yield.
2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide as an oxidant, which has gained significant attention in the field. This method utilizes iron-zeolites as catalysts, particularly for the conversion of propane to propylene.
3. One of the challenges in ODHP with N2O is the deactivation mechanism of the catalyst due to the formation and deposition of coke on the surface.

1. 当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括即使在较低的烷烃转化率下也会形成大量二氧化碳（CO和CO2），导致低烯烃选择性和产率。
2. 通过提出使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）解决了这些问题，引起了广泛的关注。这种方法利用铁沸石作为催化剂，特别是用于将丙烷转化为丙烯。
3. ODHP与N2O中催化剂的失活机制之一是表面沉积焦炭。
