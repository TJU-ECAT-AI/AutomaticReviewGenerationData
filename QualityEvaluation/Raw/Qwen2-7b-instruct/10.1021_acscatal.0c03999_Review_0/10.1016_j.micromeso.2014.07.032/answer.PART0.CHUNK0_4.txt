[1] "Despite considerable research effort with respect to ODHP with N2O over iron-zeolites, some problems are still to be solved before the further development of this reaction."
[2] "First of all, the reaction mechanism of the ODHP with N2O is not quite clear yet."
[3] "Formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[4] "However, the specification of coke and its origin are not fully understood."
[5] "Remark- ably, a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s1 could be obtained."
[6] "FeOAl species were identified as the active sites."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include over-oxidation leading to low olefin selectivity and yield when using dioxygen. These issues are addressed by oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which uses nitrous oxide as an oxidant, potentially offering higher olefin selectivity and yield. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One limitation is the complexity in understanding the reaction mechanism when propane reductant is involved. Another challenge is the lack of clarity regarding the specific nature and origin of coke deposits on the catalyst surface, which can lead to catalyst deactivation.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括使用氧气时的过氧化导致低烯烃选择性和产率。通过使用硝酸氧化物作为氧化剂的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）可能解决这些问题，提供更高的烯烃选择性和产率。然而，ODHP也存在优势和限制。一个限制是理解涉及丙烷还原剂时反应机制的复杂性。另一个挑战是不清楚催化剂表面焦炭沉积的具体性质及其来源，这可能导致催化剂失活。

2. 在进行ODHP反应时，铁氧化铝物种被识别为活性位点，这有助于提高丙烯的初始产率至30%，在高转动频率0.037秒1的情况下。
