1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the extensive formation of carbon oxides (CO and CO2) due to over-oxidation, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield when using dioxygen as the oxidant. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by proposing the use of nitrous oxide (N2O) as an alternative oxidant, which potentially reduces the formation of carbon oxides. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Nitrous oxide offers a more selective route to produce light olefins, but the reaction mechanism with propane is less clear compared to reactions with dioxygen. The specific challenges include understanding the activation and conversion of nitrous oxide on iron-zeolites, designing effective catalysts, and addressing the deactivation mechanism caused by coke formation on the catalyst surface.

2. Fe-ZSM-5 exhibits superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination process. It achieves a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1. The material is characterized by simple FeOAl species as the active sites, which contribute to its effectiveness in the ODHP process. Additionally, the absence of Brnsted acid sites in Fe-ZSM-5 makes it an ideal model catalyst for studying the ODHP with N2O, as it simplifies the reaction mechanism and facilitates the investigation of the reaction and deactivation mechanisms.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于过氧化导致大量二氧化碳（CO和CO2）的形成，这导致了低烯烃选择性和烯烃产率。通过将硝酸氧化物（N2O）作为替代氧化剂提出丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODHP），解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP具有其自身的优点和限制。N2O提供了更选择性的轻烯烃生产途径，但与使用氧气的反应机制相比，N2O与丙烷的反应机制尚不清楚。特定的挑战包括理解铁沸石上N2O的激活和转化、设计有效的催化剂以及解决由催化剂表面形成的焦炭导致的催化剂失活机制。

2. 在严重煅烧过程中，Fe-ZSM-5显示出在ODHP中使用N2O的优越性能。它在高转速下达到最大初始丙烯产率为30%，转速为0.037 s−1。该材料以简单FeOAl物种作为活性位点，这有助于其在ODHP过程中的有效性。此外，Fe-ZSM-5中几乎没有Brnsted酸性位点，使它成为研究ODHP与N2O的理想模型催化剂。这简化了反应机制并促进了反应和失活机制的研究。
