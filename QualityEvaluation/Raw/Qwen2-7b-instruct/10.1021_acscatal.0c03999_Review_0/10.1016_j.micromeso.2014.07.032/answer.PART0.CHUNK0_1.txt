[1] "Light olefins are very important components for the petrochemical industry with increasing market demands in recent years."
[2] "During the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with dioxygen, carbon oxides (CO and CO2) are extensively formed by over-oxidation even at moderate alkane conversions, resulting in low olefin selectivity and olefin yield."
[3] "Recently, it has been proposed to use nitrous oxide instead of dioxygen as oxidant, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes with N2O has attracted considerable attention."
[4] "Iron-zeolites have been developed as unique catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes with N2O, especially the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP)."
[5] "Formation and deposition of coke on the catalyst surface are responsible for catalyst deactivation."
[6] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low olefin selectivity and olefin yield due to over-oxidation of light alkanes with dioxygen. Nitrous oxide has been proposed as an alternative oxidant, attracting significant attention due to its potential to improve propylene production efficiency.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) specifically addresses these issues by utilizing nitrous oxide as an oxidant, which has shown promise in producing propylene with higher selectivity compared to traditional dioxygen-based methods. This approach leverages the unique properties of iron-zeolites as catalysts for propylene production.

3. Despite the progress, challenges remain, such as understanding the reaction mechanism of ODHP with nitrous oxide and the deactivation mechanisms of catalysts in this process. The use of Fe-ZSM-5 as a catalyst after severe calcination has demonstrated superior performance, indicating potential for further optimization and commercial application.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括使用氧气氧化轻烷烃时，由于过氧化导致低烯烃选择性和产量。已经提出了使用硝酸盐作为替代氧化剂，并且使用硝酸盐进行轻烷烃氧化引起了广泛关注，这表明了提高丙烯生产效率的潜力。

2. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过利用硝酸盐作为氧化剂特别地解决了这些挑战，这表明了与传统基于氧气的方法相比，使用硝酸盐可以提高丙烯的选择性。这种方法利用铁沸石的独特性质作为丙烯生产的催化剂。

3. 尽管取得了进展，但仍存在一些挑战，如理解使用硝酸盐进行ODHP的反应机制和催化剂的失活机制。在严重煅烧后使用Fe-ZSM-5作为催化剂已经显示出优越的性能，这表明有潜力进一步优化并实现商业化应用。
