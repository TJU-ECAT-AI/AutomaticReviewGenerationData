[1] "Many efforts have been made to gain high yields of propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Recently, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes at high temperatures has been shown to be a promising route for the selective production of short-chain olefins."
[2] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems, with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[3] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."
[4] "The obtained results show the importance of both of these parameters in the reaction conditions used for the present study. Thus, an appropriate combination of both H2S in the feed and a short contact time can afford high yields of propene."
[5] "Further work is currently in progress to identify more active and selective catalysts, and also to elucidate the active role of H2S in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:
1. High energy consumption due to high temperatures required in processes like cracking and dehydrogenation.
2. Formation of coke, which clogs equipment and reduces efficiency.
3. Limited selectivity for propene production, often resulting in lower propene yields compared to other pathways.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:
1. Operating at lower temperatures compared to traditional methods, making it more energy-efficient.
2. Minimizing coke formation by utilizing oxygen selectively, thus preserving catalyst life and enhancing operational efficiency.
3. Offering improved selectivity for propene production, leading to higher yields.

In the context of oxidant selection, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:
Advantages:
1. Oxygen's role in ODHP allows for selective propene production, avoiding the formation of coke.
2. Higher propene yields compared to conventional methods due to optimized reaction conditions.

Limitations:
1. Challenges in achieving high propene yields remain, especially at high conversion rates, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation.
2. Selectivity losses increase with increasing conversion, making it difficult to maintain high propene yields over broad conversion ranges.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include:
1. Propene re-adsorption and oxidation, leading to decreased propene yields.
2. Extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion rates, necessitating careful control of reaction conditions.

In addressing these challenges, the study highlights the potential of incorporating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the feed gas. The introduction of H2S enhances propene selectivity and yield in ODHP at short contact times, offering a promising avenue for improving propene production efficiency. This enhancement is attributed to H2S's ability to suppress side reactions, thereby facilitating the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

The study emphasizes the importance of optimizing both H2S concentration and contact time to achieve high propene yields. By fine-tuning these parameters, the researchers have demonstrated the ability to obtain a net propene yield of 30.4% over a V2O5/A12O3 catalyst at 700°C and a contact time of 0.005 seconds. Future work aims to identify more active and selective catalysts and to elucidate the active role of H2S in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, potentially leading to even greater improvements in propene yield and selectivity.

主要的挑战包括：
1. 现有丙烯生产方法的能量消耗高，需要在高温下进行。
2. 在非氧化性途径中形成的焦炭会堵塞设备，降低效率。
3. 丙烯选择性较低，导致产量低于其他途径。

氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过以下方式解决这些问题：
1. 相对于传统方法，操作温度更低，因此更节能。
2. 通过选择性使用氧气避免焦炭形成，从而保护催化剂寿命并提高运行效率。
3. 提供更高的丙烯选择性，导致更高的产率。

在氧化剂选择的背景下，ODHP具有优势和局限性：
优势：
1. 氧气在ODHP中的作用允许选择性丙烯生产，避免焦炭形成。
2. 与传统方法相比，由于优化了反应条件，具有更高的丙烯产率。

局限性：
1. 高转化率下丙烯再吸附和氧化导致丙烯产率降低。
2. 随着转化率增加，选择性损失加剧，需要仔细控制反应条件以维持高丙烯产率。

ODHP面临的特定挑战包括：
1. 丙烯再吸附和氧化，导致丙烯产率降低。
2. 随着转化率的增加，选择性损失显著，需要精确控制反应条件。

研究强调了向反应气体中加入硫化氢（H2S）的潜力。H2S的引入在短停留时间内显著提高了丙烯选择性和产率，为提高丙烯生产效率提供了一条有前景的途径。这种增强归因于H2S抑制副反应的能力，从而促进选择性氧化脱氢化丙烷生成丙烯。

研究强调了优化H2S浓度和停留时间的重要性，以实现高丙烯产率。通过调整这些参数，研究人员已经证明能够在700°C和接触时间为0.005秒时，通过V2O5/A12O3催化剂获得30.4%的丙烯产率。未来的工作旨在识别更具活性和选择性的催化剂，并阐明H2S在丙烷氧化脱氢化中的积极作用，可能进一步提高丙烯产率和选择性。
