[1] "This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."
[2] "For the propane ODH, up to 60% selectivity to total olefins (propene selectivity below 30%) at nearly 100% conversion of propane has been achieved with a catalyst contact time of 5 ms at 800–1000 C."
[3] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems, with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[4] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times."
[5] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly."
[6] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."
[7] "It should be noted that the propene yield was only 19.7% in the homogeneous reaction under the same conditions, so that the excellent performance of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S must be attributed to some feature of the catalyst in the current investigation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, the formation of coke which can clog equipment, and the potential for high emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more thermodynamically favorable process at lower temperatures, reducing the formation of coke, and potentially lowering emissions. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges related to selectivity, as the yield of propene tends to decrease with increasing conversion rates. The choice of oxidant, particularly oxygen, can significantly impact the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of noble metals like platinum in previous studies has shown promise, but the investigation of less expensive vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts is still in its infancy. The introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the feed mixture has been found to enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, particularly at short contact times. This approach has led to improved propene yields and selectivities, especially when using a V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, which offers high olefin selectivity, including propene, at temperatures around 700°C. The presence of H2S in the feed mixture plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, leading to higher propene yields compared to homogeneous reactions without H2S.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、焦炭的生成导致设备堵塞以及潜在的高排放。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供在较低温度下更有利的热力学过程，减少焦炭的生成，并可能降低排放来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在提高丙烯收率的同时面临选择性的问题，随着转化率的增加，丙烯的选择性和产率会降低。选择氧化剂，尤其是氧气，对过程的效率和选择性有重大影响。使用铂等贵金属在以往的研究中已显示出潜力，但关于以钒或钼为基的氧化物催化剂的研究还处于起步阶段。向进料混合气中加入硫化氢（H2S）已被发现能增强丙烷的氧化脱氢化至丙烯，尤其是在短停留时间的情况下。这种方法导致了改进的丙烯产率和选择性，特别是当使用V2O5/A12O3催化剂时，该催化剂在约700°C的温度下提供了高度的烯烃选择性，包括丙烯。进料混合气中硫化氢的存在对催化剂的活性和选择性起着关键作用，导致与不含H2S的均相反应相比更高的丙烯产率。

1. Current propylene production methods often involve issues related to high energy consumption, formation of coke, and limited selectivity, particularly during the cracking process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, reducing coke formation, and offering improved selectivity for propene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, primarily related to the optimization of oxidant selection and managing the selectivity of propene production, especially concerning the balance between propene yield and potential oxidation side reactions.

2. In the context of propylene production, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures is a promising method for selective production of olefins. It allows for the production of propene at high yields with reduced coke formation compared to traditional methods. However, these studies are predominantly focused on noble metal catalysts like platinum, with less exploration into vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts.

3. The introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the feed gas for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane can significantly enhance propene yield. This enhancement is attributed to the promotion effect of H2S on the activity and selectivity for propene production, leading to higher yields compared to traditional methods. This approach offers a viable alternative for improving propene yields in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:
1. High energy consumption due to high temperatures required in processes like cracking and dehydrogenation.
2. Formation of coke, which clogs equipment and reduces efficiency.
3. Limited selectivity for propene production, often resulting in lower propene yields compared to other pathways.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by:
1. Operating at lower temperatures compared to traditional methods, making it more energy-efficient.
2. Minimizing coke formation by utilizing oxygen selectively, thus preserving catalyst life and enhancing operational efficiency.
3. Offering improved selectivity for propene production, leading to higher yields.

In the context of oxidant selection, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations:
Advantages:
1. Oxygen's role in ODHP allows for selective propene production, avoiding the formation of coke.
2. Higher propene yields compared to conventional methods due to optimized reaction conditions.

Limitations:
1. Challenges in achieving high propene yields remain, especially at high conversion rates, due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation.
2. Selectivity losses increase with increasing conversion, making it difficult to maintain high propene yields over broad conversion ranges.

The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include:
1. Propene re-adsorption and oxidation, leading to decreased propene yields.
2. Extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion rates, necessitating careful control of reaction conditions.

In addressing these challenges, the study highlights the potential of incorporating hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the feed gas. The introduction of H2S enhances propene selectivity and yield in ODHP at short contact times, offering a promising avenue for improving propene production efficiency. This enhancement is attributed to H2S's ability to suppress side reactions, thereby facilitating the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

The study emphasizes the importance of optimizing both H2S concentration and contact time to achieve high propene yields. By fine-tuning these parameters, the researchers have demonstrated the ability to obtain a net propene yield of 30.4% over a V2O5/A12O3 catalyst at 700°C and a contact time of 0.005 seconds. Future work aims to identify more active and selective catalysts and to elucidate the active role of H2S in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, potentially leading to even greater improvements in propene yield and selectivity.

3. 提供更高的丙烯选择性，导致更高的产率。

在氧化剂选择的背景下，ODHP具有优势和局限性：
优势：
1. 氧气在ODHP中的作用允许选择性丙烯生产，避免焦炭形成。
2. 与传统方法相比，由于优化了反应条件，具有更高的丙烯产率。

局限性：
1. 高转化率下丙烯再吸附和氧化导致丙烯产率降低。
2. 随着转化率增加，选择性损失加剧，需要仔细控制反应条件以维持高丙烯产率。

ODHP面临的特定挑战包括：
1. 丙烯再吸附和氧化，导致丙烯产率降低。
2. 随着转化率的增加，选择性损失显著，需要精确控制反应条件。

研究强调了向反应气体中加入硫化氢（H2S）的潜力。H2S的引入在短停留时间内显著提高了丙烯选择性和产率，为提高丙烯生产效率提供了一条有前景的途径。这种增强归因于H2S抑制副反应的能力，从而促进选择性氧化脱氢化丙烷生成丙烯。

研究强调了优化H2S浓度和停留时间的重要性，以实现高丙烯产率。通过调整这些参数，研究人员已经证明能够在700°C和接触时间为0.005秒时，通过V2O5/A12O3催化剂获得30.4%的丙烯产率。未来的工作旨在识别更具活性和选择性的催化剂，并阐明H2S在丙烷氧化脱氢化中的积极作用，可能进一步提高丙烯产率和选择性。

Prior research on adding H2S to a Pt/A12O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation without oxygen did not show significant improvements in propene formation. Patents suggest potential selectivity benefits from incorporating H2S in uncatalyzed thermal dehydrogenation of propane to propene.

丙烯生产通常面临能量消耗和在常规裂解和脱氢过程中形成的焦炭的问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种替代方法，该方法在较低温度下是热力学有利的，并且通过使用氧气抑制了焦炭形成，从而降低了常规方法中的能耗。然而，在转化率增加时，ODHP通常会遇到高选择性损失的问题，主要是由于丙烯再吸附和随后氧化为碳氧化物导致丙烯产量低于30%。铂等贵金属催化剂已被广泛使用，但对钒或钼基氧化物催化剂的研究较少。一些轻微的氧化剂如二氧化碳和一氧化二氮可以提高丙烯选择性。将硫化氢添加到进气流中作为促进剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中尚未进行过充分探索。先前研究在没有氧气的情况下，将硫化氢添加到铂/氧化铝催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢，没有显示出显著的丙烯形成改善。专利表明，在无催化条件下将硫化氢加入丙烷热脱氢成丙烯可能具有潜在的选择性优势。当前的研究表明，在添加硫化氢到进气流中并优化反应条件的情况下，可以显著提高ODHP的丙烯产率。
