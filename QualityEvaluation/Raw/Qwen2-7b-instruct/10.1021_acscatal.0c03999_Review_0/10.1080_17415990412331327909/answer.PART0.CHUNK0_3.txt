[1] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
[2] "In comparison, the yield of propene at the same residence time without H2S being present was only one-half of this value."
[3] "It should be noted that the propene yield was only 19.7% in the homogeneous reaction under the same conditions, so that the excellent performance of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S must be attributed to some feature of the catalyst in the current investigation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include extensive selectivity losses with increasing conversion, often leading to propene yields lower than 30%. This is due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2). Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a route that is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, with the presence of oxygen inhibiting the formation of coke, a common issue in non-oxidative routes. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in selecting the right oxidant. The use of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) as a gas-phase promoter has been shown to significantly enhance the yield of propene. The V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, when used in the presence of H2S, demonstrated high propene selectivity and yield, surpassing previous results. This improvement can be attributed to some unique feature of the catalyst in the current investigation.

在当前丙烯生产方法中，主要挑战包括随着转化率增加，选择性损失严重，导致丙烯产率低于30%。这是由于丙烯再吸附及其随后氧化为二氧化碳（CO和CO2）所致。氧化脱氢法通过提供一个在较低温度下更有利于的途径来解决这些问题，并且氧气的存在可以抑制形成焦炭，这是非氧化法中常见的问题。然而，氧化脱氢法也存在自身的一系列挑战，尤其是在选择合适的氧化剂方面。将氢硫酸（H2S）作为气相促进剂的应用已被证明可以显著提高丙烯产率。当使用V2O5/A12O3催化剂与H2S共存时，展示了高丙烯选择性和产率，超过了以往的结果。这种改进归因于当前研究中催化剂的一些独特特性。
