[1] "Many efforts have been made to gain high yields of propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "This process provides an attractive alternate route for the production of alkenes from alkanes compared with the conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes."
[3] "This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."
[4] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems,with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[5] "In addition, it has been shown that the addition of some mild oxidants, such as CO2 and N2O,can effectively promote the selectivity for propene."
[6] "While the use of gas-phase promoters has been considered in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, addition of H2S to the feed gas has not been investigated to our knowledge."
[7] "Gaseous doping with hydrogen sulfide was, however, investigated in the presence of a Pt/A12O3 catalyst as to its effect on catalyst activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation without O2, but no apparent enhancement of propene formation was found."
[8] "Claims of selectivity benefits can, however, be found within the patent literature from incorporation of H2S in the thermal dehydrogenation of propane to propene for uncatalyzed systems."
[9] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."

Propylene production typically faces challenges related to energy consumption and the formation of coke during conventional cracking and dehydrogenation processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative method that is thermodynamically favorable at lower temperatures and inhibits coke formation by utilizing oxygen. However, this process usually involves high selectivity losses with increasing conversion, primarily due to propene re-adsorption and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides, leading to lower propene yields than 30%. Noble metal catalysts, such as platinum, have been widely used, but less research has focused on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts. Some mild oxidants like CO2 and N2O can enhance propene selectivity. Adding H2S to the feed gas has not been thoroughly explored as a potential promoter in ODHP. Prior research on adding H2S to a Pt/A12O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation without oxygen did not show significant improvements in propene formation. Patents suggest potential selectivity benefits from incorporating H2S in uncatalyzed thermal dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The current study demonstrates that introducing H2S into the feed gas and optimizing reaction conditions can significantly boost propene yield in ODHP.

丙烯生产通常面临能量消耗和在常规裂解和脱氢过程中形成的焦炭的问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种替代方法，该方法在较低温度下是热力学有利的，并且通过使用氧气抑制了焦炭形成，从而降低了常规方法中的能耗。然而，在转化率增加时，ODHP通常会遇到高选择性损失的问题，主要是由于丙烯再吸附和随后氧化为碳氧化物导致丙烯产量低于30%。铂等贵金属催化剂已被广泛使用，但对钒或钼基氧化物催化剂的研究较少。一些轻微的氧化剂如二氧化碳和一氧化二氮可以提高丙烯选择性。将硫化氢添加到进气流中作为促进剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中尚未进行过充分探索。先前研究在没有氧气的情况下，将硫化氢添加到铂/氧化铝催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢，没有显示出显著的丙烯形成改善。专利表明，在无催化条件下将硫化氢加入丙烷热脱氢成丙烯可能具有潜在的选择性优势。当前的研究表明，在添加硫化氢到进气流中并优化反应条件的情况下，可以显著提高ODHP的丙烯产率。
