[1] "This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."
[2] "For the propane ODH, up to 60% selectivity to total olefins (propene selectivity below 30%) at nearly 100% conversion of propane has been achieved with a catalyst contact time of 5 ms at 800–1000 C."
[3] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems, with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[4] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times."
[5] "The introduction of H2S to the feed gas was found to have a noticeable effect (bottom five rows of data in table 1) in that the amounts of COx, C2H4, and CH4 were reduced significantly."
[6] "With H2S in the feed mixture, up to 70% selectivity to propene could be achieved with a conversion of 28.1% propane at 700 C."
[7] "It should be noted that the propene yield was only 19.7% in the homogeneous reaction under the same conditions, so that the excellent performance of V2O5/A12O3 catalyst in the presence of H2S must be attributed to some feature of the catalyst in the current investigation."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, the formation of coke which can clog equipment, and the potential for high emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more thermodynamically favorable process at lower temperatures, reducing the formation of coke, and potentially lowering emissions. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges related to selectivity, as the yield of propene tends to decrease with increasing conversion rates. The choice of oxidant, particularly oxygen, can significantly impact the efficiency and selectivity of the process. The use of noble metals like platinum in previous studies has shown promise, but the investigation of less expensive vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts is still in its infancy. The introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the feed mixture has been found to enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, particularly at short contact times. This approach has led to improved propene yields and selectivities, especially when using a V2O5/A12O3 catalyst, which offers high olefin selectivity, including propene, at temperatures around 700°C. The presence of H2S in the feed mixture plays a crucial role in enhancing the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, leading to higher propene yields compared to homogeneous reactions without H2S.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、焦炭的生成导致设备堵塞以及潜在的高排放。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供在较低温度下更有利的热力学过程，减少焦炭的生成，并可能降低排放来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP在提高丙烯收率的同时面临选择性的问题，随着转化率的增加，丙烯的选择性和产率会降低。选择氧化剂，尤其是氧气，对过程的效率和选择性有重大影响。使用铂等贵金属在以往的研究中已显示出潜力，但关于以钒或钼为基的氧化物催化剂的研究还处于起步阶段。向进料混合气中加入硫化氢（H2S）已被发现能增强丙烷的氧化脱氢化至丙烯，尤其是在短停留时间的情况下。这种方法导致了改进的丙烯产率和选择性，特别是当使用V2O5/A12O3催化剂时，该催化剂在约700°C的温度下提供了高度的烯烃选择性，包括丙烯。进料混合气中硫化氢的存在对催化剂的活性和选择性起着关键作用，导致与不含H2S的均相反应相比更高的丙烯产率。
