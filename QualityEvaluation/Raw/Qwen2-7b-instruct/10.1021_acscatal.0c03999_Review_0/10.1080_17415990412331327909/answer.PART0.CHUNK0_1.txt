[1] "This is because ODH is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, and the presence of O2 inhibits the formation of coke prevalent in non-oxidative routes."
[2] "Especially for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene, the selectivity losses with increasing conversion are extensive and reported to be due to propene re-adsorption, and subsequent oxidation to carbon oxides (CO and CO2), which leads to propene yields lower than 30%."
[3] "Many efforts have been made to gain high yields of propene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Recently, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes at high temperatures has been shown to be a promising route for the selective production of short-chain olefins."
[4] "However, most of these studies are based on noble metal Pt catalyst systems,with little work having been done on vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts."
[5] "In this paper we report on the study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S at short contact times. This study shows that the yield of propene can be significantly enhanced by the introduction of H2S in the feed gas and suitable optimization of the reaction conditions."

1. Current propylene production methods often involve issues related to high energy consumption, formation of coke, and limited selectivity, particularly during the cracking process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by operating at lower temperatures, reducing coke formation, and offering improved selectivity for propene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, primarily related to the optimization of oxidant selection and managing the selectivity of propene production, especially concerning the balance between propene yield and potential oxidation side reactions.

2. In the context of propylene production, short-contact-time oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at high temperatures is a promising method for selective production of olefins. It allows for the production of propene at high yields with reduced coke formation compared to traditional methods. However, these studies are predominantly focused on noble metal catalysts like platinum, with less exploration into vanadium- or molybdate-based oxide catalysts.

3. The introduction of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) into the feed gas for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane can significantly enhance propene yield. This enhancement is attributed to the promotion effect of H2S on the activity and selectivity for propene production, leading to higher yields compared to traditional methods. This approach offers a viable alternative for improving propene yields in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法常面临能耗高、焦炭生成以及选择性差等问题，特别是裂解过程。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过在较低温度下运行、减少焦炭生成以及提高丙烯产率来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也存在挑战，主要集中在氧化剂选择优化和管理丙烯生产的选择性上，特别是在平衡丙烯产率与潜在氧化副反应之间的关系上。

2. 在丙烯生产背景下，短接触时间下的高温氧化脱氢丙烷是选择性生产短链烯烃的有前景方法。它允许在较低的焦炭形成情况下，以高产率生产丙烯，与传统方法相比。然而，这些研究主要集中在铂等贵金属催化剂上，对钒或钼基氧化物催化剂的研究较少。

3. 在氧化脱氢丙烷过程中向气体中引入硫化氢（H2S）可以显著提高丙烯产率。这种增强归因于H2S对丙烯生成的活性和选择性的促进作用，导致与传统方法相比更高的产率。这种方法为提高氧化脱氢过程中的丙烯产率提供了可行的替代方案。
