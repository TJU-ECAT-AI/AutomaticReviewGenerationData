1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and substantial greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process. Oxygen is typically selected as the oxidant due to its low cost and availability, although it poses challenges like the potential formation of carbon monoxide and the necessity for high temperatures. Challenges related to using oxygen include the requirement for a stable catalyst system capable of enduring severe conditions and the risk of catalyst deactivation.
