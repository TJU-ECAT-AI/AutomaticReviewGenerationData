[1] "The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with the steam reforming process."
[2] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more energy-efficient alternative, reducing the need for high-temperature reactions."
[3] "However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of an appropriate oxidant."
[4] "The use of oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP is advantageous because it is abundant, non-toxic, and cost-effective."
[5] "Despite these benefits, the use of oxygen in ODHP also poses specific challenges, including the potential for exothermic reactions and the risk of catalyst poisoning."

Propylene production methods face significant challenges due to high energy consumption and carbon emissions from the steam reforming process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) provides a more energy-efficient alternative, but it has its own set of challenges, especially concerning the choice of an oxidant. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP is advantageous because it is abundant, non-toxic, and cost-effective. However, it also brings specific challenges such as the potential for exothermic reactions and the risk of catalyst poisoning.
