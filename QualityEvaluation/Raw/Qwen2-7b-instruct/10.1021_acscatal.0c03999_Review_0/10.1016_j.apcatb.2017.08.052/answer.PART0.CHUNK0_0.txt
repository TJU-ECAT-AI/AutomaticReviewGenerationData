[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an attractive alternative to conventional methods for propylene production."
[2] "The main challenge with current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and associated environmental impact."
[3] "In contrast, ODHP has the potential to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions."
[4] "However, the selection of an appropriate oxidant remains a significant challenge in ODHP."
[5] "Using pure oxygen as an oxidant can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts such as CO and CO2."
[6] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an oxidant in ODHP, which may offer certain advantages."
[7] "The use of CO2 as an oxidant can potentially enhance the selectivity towards propylene."
[8] "However, the efficiency of the process is affected by factors such as temperature, pressure, and catalyst properties."
