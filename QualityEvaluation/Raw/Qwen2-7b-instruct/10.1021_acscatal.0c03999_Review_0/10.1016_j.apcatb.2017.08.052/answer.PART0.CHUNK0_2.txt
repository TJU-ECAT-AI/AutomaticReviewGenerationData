The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption and carbon emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method to produce propylene. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly concerning the selection of the oxidant and the specific difficulties encountered when using oxygen.
