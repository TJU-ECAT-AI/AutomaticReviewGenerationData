[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an efficient method for producing propylene with CO2 as the oxidant."
[2] "In contrast to conventional methods, ODHP has several advantages such as high propylene selectivity, energy efficiency, and reduced environmental impact."
[3] "However, the reaction mechanism of ODHP is complex, and the selection of the optimal operating conditions is challenging."
[4] "The use of oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP presents several challenges, including the potential for product degradation and the risk of carbon formation."
[5] "The presence of CO2 in the feedstock can also lead to operational difficulties due to its low reactivity and solubility."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are mainly related to energy consumption, environmental impact, and product purity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering high propylene selectivity, improved energy efficiency, and lower environmental footprint. However, the complex reaction mechanism and the difficulty in setting optimal operating conditions pose significant challenges. When using oxygen as the oxidant, there is a risk of product degradation and carbon formation. Additionally, the low reactivity and solubility of CO2 in the feedstock can create operational difficulties.
