The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are mainly related to energy consumption, environmental impact, and product purity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering high propylene selectivity, improved energy efficiency, and lower environmental footprint. However, the complex reaction mechanism and the difficulty in setting optimal operating conditions pose significant challenges. When using oxygen as the oxidant, there is a risk of product degradation and carbon formation. Additionally, the low reactivity and solubility of CO2 in the feedstock can create operational difficulties.
