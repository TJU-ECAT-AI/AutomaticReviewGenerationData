Despite the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market [79], chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen [5].

In this sense, the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks [13].

In recent years, Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes [5,1721].

Compared with the γ-Ga2O3 catalyst, the Ga5Al5O15 sample exhibited significantly enhanced stability despite being slightly inferior to γ-Ga2O3 at the initial stage of the reaction.

For all of the catalysts, propane conversion decreased with increasing reaction time.

With high selectivity to propylene, such outstanding stability for the gallia-containing catalysts has never before been reported.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, specifically steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their limited capabilities to meet the increasing demand for propylene. Chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane without hydrogen. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing an alternative route to produce alkenes from less reactive and cheaper saturated feedstocks. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen. Oxygen is often selected as the oxidant due to its availability and low cost, but its usage poses challenges in terms of controlling the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions. The study highlights the importance of surface acidity in the catalytic activity of gallia-based catalysts and suggests that the formation of a galliaalumina solid solution enhances stability and activity in the ODHP process. Despite the advantages, the stability of gallium oxide-based catalysts remains a challenge, especially regarding their deactivation over time.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解的能力有限，无法满足丙烯市场需求的增加。无铬催化剂对于在没有氢的情况下进行丙烷脱氢是高度可取的。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种从反应性较低、成本较低的饱和原料中制备烯烃的替代途径，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和使用氧气的具体挑战方面也存在一系列优势和限制。由于氧气的可用性和低成本，通常选择氧气作为氧化剂，但其使用带来了控制反应条件以防止意外副反应的挑战。研究表明，表面酸性在镓基催化剂的催化活性中至关重要，并且形成镓铝固溶体可以增强稳定性与活性，在ODHP过程中。尽管存在优势，镓氧化物基催化剂的稳定性仍然是一个挑战，特别是在长时间运行后的失活问题上。

[1] "Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3-based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours [21,23,24], because a high density of medium-strong acid sites on the surface of the Ga2O3-based materials favors considerable coke formation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions [21,23,25]."
[2] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."
[3] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples. Such a negative effect was previously reported by Xu et al. over Al2O3- and ZrO2-supported gallium oxide catalysts [23]."
[4] "It is noteworthy that even after 50 h on stream, high conversion of propane (up to 22.5%) was still maintained for Ga5Al5O15."

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods includes the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing an alternative route for obtaining propylene from propane, potentially offering more efficient and sustainable methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in selecting appropriate oxidants and managing the specific difficulties associated with using oxygen.

2. In the context of the specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP, the document discusses the issue of coke formation on the surface of the Ga2O3-based catalysts, which can lead to deactivation. High-density medium-strong acid sites on the surface of these materials facilitate coke formation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide was found to have a negative effect on the catalyst performance in some cases. This phenomenon was previously reported by Xu et al. when using Al2O3- and ZrO2-supported gallium oxide catalysts.

4. The Ga5Al5O15 catalyst maintained high conversion of propane even after 50 hours of continuous operation, indicating remarkable stability over prolonged periods.

5. Gallia-containing catalysts that offer high selectivity to propylene have not been reported before, marking a significant advancement in the field of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is meeting the increasing demands of the propylene market, especially due to the limitations of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing an alternative route for obtaining propylene from low-cost and poorly reactive alkanes. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One key advantage is the flexibility in oxidant selection, which allows for the use of various gases like oxygen, air, or carbon dioxide. Oxygen is commonly chosen for its high reactivity, but its use can lead to safety concerns and high capital costs. Carbon dioxide, while less reactive, can be more cost-effective and safer to handle. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for high purity, which can be expensive, and the risk of combustion if not properly controlled. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, can reduce the risk of combustion but may require additional steps to ensure complete conversion and may not be as efficient in certain processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是如何满足丙烯市场日益增长的需求，尤其是由于蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解的局限性。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供从低成本且反应性较差的烷烃获取丙烯的替代途径，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP具有自身的一系列优势和限制。一个关键的优势是选择氧化剂的灵活性，这允许使用各种气体，如氧气、空气或二氧化碳。通常选择氧气是因为其高活性，但这样做可能带来成本高昂的安全问题和高昂的资本成本。二氧化碳虽然活性较低，但可能更经济且安全。使用氧气的具体挑战包括需要高纯度氧气，这可能成本高昂，并且存在燃烧的风险，如果控制不当。而二氧化碳可以降低燃烧风险，但可能需要额外步骤确保完全转化，而且在某些过程中可能效率不高。
