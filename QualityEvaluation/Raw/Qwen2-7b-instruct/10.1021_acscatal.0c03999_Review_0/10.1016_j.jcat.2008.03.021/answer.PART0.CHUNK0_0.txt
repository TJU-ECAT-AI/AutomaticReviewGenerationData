What are the primary challenges in current propylene production methods, and how does oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) address these issues while presenting its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen?

Despite the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market [79], chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen [5].

In this sense, the catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes is a process of considerable importance, because it represents a route for obtaining alkenes from poorly reactive and low-cost saturated feedstocks [13].

In recent years, Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes [5,1721].

Compared with the γ-Ga2O3 catalyst, the Ga5Al5O15 sample exhibited significantly enhanced stability despite being slightly inferior to γ-Ga2O3 at the initial stage of the reaction.

For all of the catalysts, propane conversion decreased with increasing reaction time.

With high selectivity to propylene, such outstanding stability for the gallia-containing catalysts has never before been reported.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, specifically steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, are their limited capabilities to meet the increasing demand for propylene. Chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane without hydrogen. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing an alternative route to produce alkenes from less reactive and cheaper saturated feedstocks. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen. Oxygen is often selected as the oxidant due to its availability and low cost, but its usage poses challenges in terms of controlling the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions. The study highlights the importance of surface acidity in the catalytic activity of gallia-based catalysts and suggests that the formation of a galliaalumina solid solution enhances stability and activity in the ODHP process. Despite the advantages, the stability of gallium oxide-based catalysts remains a challenge, especially regarding their deactivation over time.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解的能力有限，无法满足丙烯市场需求的增加。无铬催化剂对于在没有氢的情况下进行丙烷脱氢是高度可取的。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供一种从反应性较低、成本较低的饱和原料中制备烯烃的替代途径，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和使用氧气的具体挑战方面也存在一系列优势和限制。由于氧气的可用性和低成本，通常选择氧气作为氧化剂，但其使用带来了控制反应条件以防止意外副反应的挑战。研究表明，表面酸性在镓基催化剂的催化活性中至关重要，并且形成镓铝固溶体可以增强稳定性与活性，在ODHP过程中。尽管存在优势，镓氧化物基催化剂的稳定性仍然是一个挑战，特别是在长时间运行后的失活问题上。
