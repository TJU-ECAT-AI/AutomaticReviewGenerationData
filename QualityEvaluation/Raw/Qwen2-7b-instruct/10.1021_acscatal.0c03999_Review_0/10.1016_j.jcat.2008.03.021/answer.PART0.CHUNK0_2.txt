[1] "Despite extensive efforts dedicated to the reaction mechanism and the factors that control activity, the aforementioned Ga2O3-based catalysts all deactivate drastically within a few hours [21,23,24], because a high density of medium-strong acid sites on the surface of the Ga2O3-based materials favors considerable coke formation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions [21,23,25]."
[2] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."
[3] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples. Such a negative effect was previously reported by Xu et al. over Al2O3- and ZrO2-supported gallium oxide catalysts [23]."
[4] "It is noteworthy that even after 50 h on stream, high conversion of propane (up to 22.5%) was still maintained for Ga5Al5O15."
[5] "With high selectivity to propylene, such outstanding stability for the gallia-containing catalysts has never before been reported."

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods includes the limited capabilities of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking to meet the increasing demands of the propylene market. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing an alternative route for obtaining propylene from propane, potentially offering more efficient and sustainable methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in selecting appropriate oxidants and managing the specific difficulties associated with using oxygen.

2. In the context of the specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP, the document discusses the issue of coke formation on the surface of the Ga2O3-based catalysts, which can lead to deactivation. High-density medium-strong acid sites on the surface of these materials facilitate coke formation under alkane dehydrogenation conditions.

3. The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide was found to have a negative effect on the catalyst performance in some cases. This phenomenon was previously reported by Xu et al. when using Al2O3- and ZrO2-supported gallium oxide catalysts.

4. The Ga5Al5O15 catalyst maintained high conversion of propane even after 50 hours of continuous operation, indicating remarkable stability over prolonged periods.

5. Gallia-containing catalysts that offer high selectivity to propylene have not been reported before, marking a significant advancement in the field of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解能力有限，无法满足丙烯市场需求的增加。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供从丙烷获取丙烯的替代途径来解决这些问题，可能提供更高效、更可持续的方法。然而，ODHP也面临着一系列挑战，特别是在选择合适的氧化剂以及管理使用氧气的具体困难方面。

2. 在使用氧气进行ODHP的具体挑战中，文献讨论了在基于Ga2O3的催化剂表面上形成焦炭的问题，这会导致催化剂失活。这些材料表面高密度的中强酸性位点在烷烃脱氢条件下有利于焦炭形成。

3. 研究发现，在某些情况下，丙烷在二氧化碳的存在下进行脱氢对催化剂性能产生负面影响。这一现象之前由Xu等人在使用Al2O3-和ZrO2支持的镓氧化物催化剂时报告过。

4. Ga5Al5O15催化剂即使在连续运行50小时后仍能保持高丙烷转化率，显示出极高的稳定性。

5. 提供高丙烯选择性的镓催化剂以前未被报道，这标志着丙烷脱氢催化剂领域的一个重大进步。
