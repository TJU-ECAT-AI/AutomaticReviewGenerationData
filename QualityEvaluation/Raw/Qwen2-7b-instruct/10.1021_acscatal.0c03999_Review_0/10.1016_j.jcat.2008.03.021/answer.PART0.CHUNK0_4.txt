[1] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8."
[2] "Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."
[3] "The results demonstrate that the formation of galliaalumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the favorable creation of a higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity,which makes the Ga2O3-based catalysts highly active and stable for the reaction."
[4] "This result, in conjunction with much higher population of weak acid sites relative to medium sites, suggests the essential role of tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites in creating the surface acidity of the mixed oxides."
[5] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples."
[6] "Compared with the γ -Ga2O3 catalyst, the Ga5Al5O15 sample exhibited significantly enhanced stability despite being slightly inferior to γ -Ga2O3 at the initial stage of the reaction."
[7] "The desorption of propylene from the catalyst surface appeared to be favored on the surface of the galliaalumina mixed oxide catalysts."
[8] "Clearly, the original activity of the Ga5Al5O15 catalyst could be fully restored,with no noticeable deactivation detected even after the second regeneration."

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is meeting the increasing demands of the propylene market, especially due to the limitations of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing an alternative route for obtaining propylene from low-cost and poorly reactive alkanes. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. One key advantage is the flexibility in oxidant selection, which allows for the use of various gases like oxygen, air, or carbon dioxide. Oxygen is commonly chosen for its high reactivity, but its use can lead to safety concerns and high capital costs. Carbon dioxide, while less reactive, can be more cost-effective and safer to handle. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for high purity, which can be expensive, and the risk of combustion if not properly controlled. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, can reduce the risk of combustion but may require additional steps to ensure complete conversion and may not be as efficient in certain processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是如何满足丙烯市场日益增长的需求，尤其是由于蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂解的局限性。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供从低成本且反应性较差的烷烃获取丙烯的替代途径，解决了这些问题。然而，ODHP具有自身的一系列优势和限制。一个关键的优势是选择氧化剂的灵活性，这允许使用各种气体，如氧气、空气或二氧化碳。通常选择氧气是因为其高活性，但这样做可能带来成本高昂的安全问题和高昂的资本成本。二氧化碳虽然活性较低，但可能更经济且安全。使用氧气的具体挑战包括需要高纯度氧气，这可能成本高昂，并且存在燃烧的风险，如果控制不当。而二氧化碳可以降低燃烧风险，但可能需要额外步骤确保完全转化，而且在某些过程中可能效率不高。
