[1] "In recent years, Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes [5,1721]. This was prompted by Nakagawas reports of exceptionally high activity of the commercial Ga2O3 for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 [20]."
[2] "However, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen [5]."
[3] "In the present study,we investigated the development of a new, efficient Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution system exhibiting significantly enhanced activity and stability for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane."
[4] "This result, taken together with the absence of any diffraction line not assignable to a single cubic phase in the corresponding XRD patterns, gives strong evidence of the formation of a series of spinel-type solid solutions with the chemical composition GaxAl10xO15 (0 < x < 10)."
[5] "The results, reported in Table 3, point to a marked composition effect on the catalytic performance of the GaxAl10xO15 samples."
[6] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples."
[7] "For all of the catalysts, propane conversion decreased with increasing reaction time."
[8] "This unusual alkane activation behavior was linked to a very strong polarizability of the CH bonds resulting from perturbation of ethane by the low-coordinated Ga3+ cations [44]."
[9] "Remarkable stability for propane dehydrogenation was recently reported for an HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3 catalyst at 873 K, but at the expense of marked side reactions,such as propane aromatization [25]."
[10] "Clearly, the original activity of the Ga5Al5O15 catalyst could be fully restored,with no noticeable deactivation detected even after the second regeneration."
