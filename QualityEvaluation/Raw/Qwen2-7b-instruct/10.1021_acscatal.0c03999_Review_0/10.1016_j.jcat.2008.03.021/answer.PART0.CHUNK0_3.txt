[1] "In this respect, an important reaction is the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene."
[2] "From environmental and practical standpoints, however, chromium-free catalysts are highly desirable for the dehydrogenation of propane in the absence of hydrogen."
[3] "In recent years, Ga2O3-based catalysts have attracted interest as potential candidates for alkane dehydrogenation processes."
[4] "Our results demonstrate that the formation of galliaalumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 can allow the favorable creation of a higher population of surface gallium sites with weak Lewis acidity,which makes the Ga2O3-based catalysts highly active and stable for the reaction."
[5] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples."
[6] "This unexpected phenomenon has been attributed to the greatly reduced propane adsorption capacity when CO2 is introduced into these systems."

1. The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is a significant process due to its role in obtaining alkenes from less reactive and cost-effective saturated feedstocks. Chromium-free catalysts are preferred for the dehydrogenation of propane without hydrogen.

2. Ga2O3-based catalysts have gained interest as alternatives for alkane dehydrogenation processes, particularly for the dehydrogenation of propane.

3. The formation of galliaalumina solid solution between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 enhances the activity and stability of Ga2O3-based catalysts for the reaction.

4. Carbon dioxide's promotion role in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples, potentially due to a significant decrease in propane adsorption capacity when CO2 is introduced.

1. 丙烷脱氢为丙烯是重要过程，因为它能够从反应性较低、成本更低的饱和原料中获取烯烃。无铬催化剂在没有氢的情况下进行丙烷脱氢具有很高的吸引力。

2. Ga2O3基催化剂已引起关注作为轻烷基脱氢过程的潜在候选物，特别是对于丙烷的脱氢。

3. 在Ga2O3和Al2O3之间形成高铝含量的镓铝氧化物固溶体能够提高表面镓原子的密度，并产生弱Lewis酸性表面，这使得Ga2O3基催化剂在反应中表现出高度的活性和稳定性。

4. 碳二氧在所有样品中对丙烷脱氢的促进作用并未被观察到，这可能归因于引入二氧化碳后丙烷吸附能力的显著降低。
