[1] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."
[2] "The addition of K significantly improved the selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 22-31% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

1. In the context of propylene production, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses several challenges such as increasing efficiency, reducing energy consumption, and minimizing environmental impact. The use of CO2 as an oxidant presents advantages in terms of sustainability and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional methods that rely on oxygen. However, ODHP also faces challenges, including the selectivity towards propylene, the potential for coke formation, and the optimization of reaction conditions.

2. The addition of potassium (K) to chromium/silica catalysts significantly improves the selectivity for propylene production from propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. An optimal K loading of around 0.2% to 0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts maximizes the yield and selectivity to propylene, achieving a propane conversion of approximately 22-31% and a propylene selectivity of about 91-100% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6.

1. 在丙烯生产背景下，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）解决了提高效率、降低能耗和减少环境影响等挑战。将二氧化碳作为氧化剂的优势在于可持续性和成本效益，与传统依赖氧气的方法相比。然而，ODHP也面临挑战，包括丙烯选择性、焦炭形成的可能性以及反应条件优化的问题。

2. 将钾（K）添加到铬/二氧化硅催化剂中显著提高了丙烷在二氧化碳存在下的丙烯生产选择性。在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中，钾的最佳负载约为0.2%至0.4%，可最大化产率和丙烯选择性，实现大约22-31%的丙烷转化率和约91-100%的丙烯选择性，在923 K时的CO2/C3H8摩尔比为3.6。
