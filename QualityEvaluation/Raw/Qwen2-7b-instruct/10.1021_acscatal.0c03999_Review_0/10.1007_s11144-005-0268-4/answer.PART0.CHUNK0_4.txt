[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "It was found that the surface acidity decreased with the increase of K in the Cr/SiO2 and led to the increase of selectivity toward propylene."
[4] "The addition of K significantly improved the selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and environmental concerns such as emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method to produce propylene. Using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODHP has several advantages, including promoting catalytic activity, maintaining activity by reducing hydrogen concentration, and inhibiting coke formation. However, selecting the appropriate oxidant, such as CO2, presents its own set of challenges, especially in terms of optimizing catalyst performance and selectivity. The use of alkali and alkaline-earth oxides in the Cr/SiO2 catalyst modifies the surface properties, decreases the redox potential, and reduces surface acidity, leading to a decrease in propane conversion and an increase in propylene selectivity. The optimized loading of potassium (K) in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst is approximately 0.2% to 0.4%, achieving a propane conversion of about 22% to 31% and a propylene selectivity of about 91% to 100% at 923 K with a CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高资本成本和环境问题，如排放。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种更节能、更环保的方法来生产丙烯，从而解决了这些挑战。使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂在ODHP中具有多项优势，包括促进催化剂活性、通过降低氢浓度维持活性以及抑制焦炭形成。然而，在选择合适的氧化剂时，如CO2，会带来一系列挑战，尤其是在优化催化剂性能和选择性方面。在Cr/SiO2催化剂中加入碱土金属氧化物改变了表面性质，降低了还原电势，减少了酸性位点，导致丙烷转化率降低和丙烯选择性增加。5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中钾（K）的最佳加载量约为0.2%至0.4%，在923 K时获得约22%至31%的丙烷转化率和约91%至100%的丙烯选择性，CO2/C3H8摩尔比为3.6。
