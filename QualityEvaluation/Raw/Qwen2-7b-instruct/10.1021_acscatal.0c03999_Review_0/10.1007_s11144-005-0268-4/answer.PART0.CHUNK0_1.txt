[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "It was found that the presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."
[4] "The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.20.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 2231% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

1. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses the primary challenges in current propylene production methods by offering an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks. It also presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly concerning the selection of oxidants and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen. 

2. CO2 plays multiple roles in the ODHP process. It increases the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, maintains the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting coke formation, and enhances propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction. 

3. The presence of CO2 promotes the catalytic activity and maintains the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation, thereby contributing positively to the efficiency of the ODHP process.

4. The optimal loading of potassium (K) in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts is found to be around 0.2-0.4%. Under these conditions, the catalysts exhibit a propane conversion of approximately 22%-31% and a selectivity towards propylene of about 91%-100% at a temperature of 923 K, with a CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of 3.6.

1. 氧化脱氢法丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种从低成本饱和碳氢化合物原料中获取烯烃和其他有机产品的替代途径，解决了当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战。它也带来了自己的优势和限制，特别是在氧化剂选择以及使用氧气时遇到的具体挑战方面。

2. 二氧化碳在ODHP过程中发挥了多重作用。它通过稀释丙烷增加了平衡转化率，通过抑制焦炭形成维持催化剂活性，并通过逆向水煤气变换反应降低氢气浓度来增强丙烷转化率。

3. 二氧化碳的存在促进了催化活性并保持了活性，通过减少氢气浓度和抑制焦炭形成，从而对ODHP过程的效率产生积极影响。

4. 在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中，钾的最佳加载量约为0.2-0.4%。在这种条件下，在923 K的温度下，当CO2/C3H8摩尔比为3.6时，催化剂的丙烷转化率约为22%-31%，丙烯选择性约为91%-100%。
