[1] "The presence of CO2 promoted the catalytic activity and maintained the activity by reducing the concentration of H2 and inhibiting the coke formation."

[3] "The addition of K significantly improved the selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 22-31% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods often involve high energy consumption, environmental concerns due to emissions, and the complexity of processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. By utilizing propane as a feedstock, ODHP reduces the dependency on fossil fuels and decreases greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional steam cracking methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, including the selection of an appropriate oxidant and managing the specific conditions required for the reaction to proceed efficiently.

In the context of oxidant selection, oxygen has traditionally been used in ODHP, but this can lead to the formation of byproducts such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is proposed as an alternative oxidant because it can increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, maintain the activity of catalysts by inhibiting coke formation, and enhance propane conversion through the reversed water-gas shift reaction. This makes CO2 a promising oxidant for ODHP, especially when considering the environmental benefits of using a less reactive and more abundant gas.

Regarding the specific challenges associated with using oxygen versus CO2, CO2 offers several advantages. It can reduce the concentration of hydrogen, thereby suppressing the water-gas shift reaction and favoring the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Additionally, CO2 helps maintain the activity of the catalysts by preventing coke formation, which is a common issue in ODHP using oxygen. The use of CO2 also leads to a higher selectivity towards propylene, which is crucial for the economic viability of the process.

The optimization of catalysts plays a critical role in improving the efficiency of ODHP, particularly when using CO2 as the oxidant. The addition of alkali and alkaline-earth metal oxides into Cr/SiO2 catalysts modifies their surface properties, decreasing the redox potential and surface acidity. This results in a decreased conversion of propane and an increased selectivity to propylene, depending on the nature and loading of the added metals. For instance, the optimized loading of potassium (K) was found to be around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, leading to a conversion of propane of about 22-31% and a selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with a CO2 /C3H8 ratio of 3.6.

In summary, while ODHP offers significant advantages over traditional propylene production methods, the selection of the oxidant (oxygen vs. CO2) and the optimization of catalyst properties are critical factors in achieving efficient and selective propylene synthesis. CO2, with its ability to enhance the reaction kinetics, reduce hydrogen concentration, and improve selectivity, represents a promising direction for future development in ODHP technology.

在当前丙烯生产方法中，主要挑战包括高能耗、环境问题以及复杂的过程。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一个可能更高效和环保的替代方案来解决这些问题。通过使用丙烷作为原料，ODHP减少了对化石燃料的依赖，并降低了与传统蒸汽裂解方法相比的温室气体排放。然而，ODHP也存在自己的挑战，包括选择合适的氧化剂以及管理反应进行时所需的特定条件。

在氧化剂选择的背景下，氧气是传统ODHP中使用的，但这可能导致形成副产品，如一氧化碳和过氧化氢。二氧化碳（CO2）被提议作为一种替代氧化剂，因为它可以增加平衡转化率，通过稀释丙烷来提高丙烷的转化率，同时维持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭形成。考虑到环境效益，使用更不活泼且更丰富的气体作为氧化剂，CO2对于ODHP特别有前景。

关于使用氧气与CO2相关联的具体挑战，CO2提供了几个优势。它可以降低氢气的浓度，从而抑制水-煤气转换反应，有利于丙烷脱氢为丙烯。此外，CO2有助于保持催化剂的活性，防止焦炭形成，这是使用氧气进行ODHP时常见的问题。使用CO2还可以导致更高的丙烯选择性，这对于过程的经济可行性至关重要。

催化剂的优化对于提高ODHP的效率起着关键作用，特别是当使用CO2作为氧化剂时。将碱土金属氧化物添加到Cr/SiO2催化剂中，修改了它们的表面性质，降低了还原电位和酸性表面，从而导致丙烷转化率降低和丙烯选择性的提高，这取决于所添加金属的性质和负载量。例如，在5%Cr/SiO2催化剂中，钾（K）的优化负载量约为0.2-0.4%，导致丙烷转化率为约22-31%，丙烯选择性为约91-100%，温度为923 K，CO2 /C3H8比例为3.6。

总之，尽管ODHP提供了显著的优势，但选择氧化剂（氧气vs. CO2）和催化剂性能的优化是实现高效和选择性丙烯合成的关键因素。CO2因其能够增强反应动力学、降低氢浓度并提高选择性而代表了ODHP技术未来发展的有希望的方向。
