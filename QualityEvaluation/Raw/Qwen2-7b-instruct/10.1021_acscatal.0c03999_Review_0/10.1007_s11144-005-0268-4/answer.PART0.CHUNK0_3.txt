[1] "The catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkanes is important for industrial applications since it represents an alternative route for obtaining alkenes and other organic products from low-cost saturated hydrocarbon feedstocks."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 is expected (1) to increase the equilibrium conversion by diluting propane, (2) to maintain the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting the coke formation, and (3) to enhance the propane conversion by reducing the concentration of H2 through the reversed water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "One of the roles of CO2 was to oxidize Cr3+ to Cr5+ or Cr6+ in the reaction."
[4] "The addition of K significantly improved the selectivity to propylene for the reaction. The optimized loading of K was found to be around 0.2-0.4% in the 5%Cr/SiO2 catalysts, and the corresponding catalysts exhibited the conversion of propane of about 22-31% and the selectivity to propylene of about 91-100% at 923 K with the CO2/C3H8 ratio of 3.6."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the high cost of hydrocarbon feedstocks, energy consumption, and environmental concerns such as greenhouse gas emissions. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more efficient use of low-cost hydrocarbon feedstocks and potentially reducing energy requirements and emissions. The use of oxygen as an oxidant is advantageous because it is abundant and relatively inexpensive, but it presents challenges due to the formation of water vapor and the need for high-temperature conditions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant offers benefits in terms of increased conversion, maintenance of catalyst activity, and inhibition of coke formation, but it also has its own set of challenges, including its higher cost compared to oxygen and the requirement for specific catalyst modifications to effectively utilize CO2 in the reaction.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) process involves converting propane into propylene through a series of chemical reactions in the presence of an appropriate catalyst. The presence of CO2 in the feed promotes the catalytic activity and maintains the activity of the catalysts by inhibiting coke formation and enhancing propane conversion through the reversed water-gas shift reaction. Oxygen, on the other hand, is commonly used as an oxidant due to its abundance and relatively low cost, but it leads to the formation of water vapor, which may require additional processes for removal. CO2 can be utilized as an oxidant in ODHP, offering potential benefits such as increased conversion efficiency and catalyst longevity, but it necessitates specific catalyst modifications to optimize its effectiveness in the reaction.
