[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[3] "In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown. These (predicted) numbers originate from ref. 7."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[6] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[7] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[9] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[10] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[11] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[12] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[13] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, along with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (shale gas) and producing pure olefins without the need for costly FCC or steam cracking processes. The use of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane as feedstocks is advantageous due to their ready availability and the drop in gas costs. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is high because of the significant price difference between propane and propylene, making it a lucrative market. The dehydrogenation process is an on-purpose technique that yields exclusively olefins, unlike the mixture of products obtained from traditional cracking methods. The use of shale gas as a feedstock is particularly advantageous due to its abundant supply and lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for producing transportation fuels or chemicals. This trend is expected to continue, with dozens of new PDH installations planned or under construction worldwide. The investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations in countries like the US, China, and Japan is a testament to the favorable market conditions for dehydrogenation technologies.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高昂的能量需求、生产特定烯烃的低选择性以及石油储量的减少，再加上油价上涨。氧化脱氢法（ODHP）通过提供更经济的原料（页岩气）并产生纯净的烯烃，从而解决了这些问题。使用乙烷和丙烷等天然气液体作为原料具有优势，因为它们易于分离且成本低廉。丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很高，因为丙烷与丙烯之间的价格差异巨大，使其成为有利可图的市场。脱氢过程是一种专一性技术，仅能产生烯烃，而传统裂解方法产生的则是混合物。使用页岩气作为原料特别有优势，因为它供应充足且成本低廉，因此它是生产交通燃料或化学品的吸引人的替代方案。预计这一趋势将持续下去，因为全球计划或正在建设的新的PDH装置数量众多。中国、美国和日本等国家对新的丁烷脱氢装置的投资是脱氢技术市场条件有利的证明。
