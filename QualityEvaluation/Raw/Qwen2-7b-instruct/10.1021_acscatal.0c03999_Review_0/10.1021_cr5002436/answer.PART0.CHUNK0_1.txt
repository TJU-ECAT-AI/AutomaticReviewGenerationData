[1] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[2] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[3] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[5] "As was shown in the previous section, two strategies have been adopted in industry to lower paraffin partial pressure, reducing the pressure below atmospheric (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process)."
[6] "Indeed, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of paraffins is related to SHC by the fact that an oxidant is also added to the feed, although in ODH the latter is done to directly oxidize the paraffin to the respective olefin."
[7] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."

Propylene production primarily faces challenges related to high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and limited petroleum reserves. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient conversion process. The use of oxygen presents a challenge in selecting the appropriate oxidant, as it must effectively oxidize paraffins without excessively combusting the hydrocarbon reactants or products. Oxygen's reactivity necessitates careful management to ensure selective oxidation. The specific challenges associated with ODHP involve optimizing the reaction conditions to achieve high selectivity and yield, while minimizing side reactions like cracking and hydrogenolysis. 

The dehydrogenation process is thermodynamically limited, requiring higher temperatures and lower partial pressures of paraffins for high conversions. Industries have adopted strategies such as reducing pressure below atmospheric (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process) to mitigate these limitations. 

In comparison, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers an exothermic reaction that is not equilibrium limited. However, controlling side reactions like cracking and excessive oxidation of products remains a significant challenge. The addition of an oxidant, such as oxygen, directly oxidizes paraffins to olefins, differing from the non-oxidative process which primarily focuses on dehydrogenation. 

Due to the complexity of the dehydrogenation mechanism, calculating turnover frequency (TOF) for catalysts is challenging. The dispersion values of the active phase (platinum) are often not available in the literature, making it difficult to precisely quantify the catalyst's performance in terms of reaction rate.

目前丙烯生产主要面临高能需求、低选择性以及有限的石油储备等挑战。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，提供更高效的转化过程。在选择合适的氧化剂时，需要考虑氧气的有效氧化作用，同时避免过度燃烧反应物或产物。氧气的活性要求精心管理以确保选择性氧化。ODHP面临的特定挑战是优化反应条件以实现高选择性和产率，同时尽量减少副反应如裂解和氢化。

脱氢过程从热力学角度来看是有限制的，需要更高的温度和更低的烷烃分压来实现高转化率。工业界已采用策略，如将压力降至大气以下（Catofin）或用蒸汽稀释烷烃进料（STAR过程），以缓解这些限制。

相比之下，氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了一个放热反应，不是平衡限制的。然而，控制副反应如裂解和产品过氧化仍然是一个重大挑战。直接向进料中添加氧化剂，如氧气，可以氧化烷烃为烯烃，这与主要关注脱氢的非氧化过程不同。

由于脱氢机制的复杂性，计算催化剂的周转频率（TOF）具有挑战性。活性相（铂）的分散值在文献中往往不可用，这使得精确量化催化剂性能，特别是在反应速率方面的计算变得困难。
