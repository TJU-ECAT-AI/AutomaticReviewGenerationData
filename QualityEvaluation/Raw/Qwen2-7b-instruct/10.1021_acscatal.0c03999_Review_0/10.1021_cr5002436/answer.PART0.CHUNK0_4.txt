[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[3] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."

1. The demand for light olefins, particularly propylene, has grown steadily over the past years, except in the Eurozone due to the economic downturn. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is heavily influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene, indicating favorable market conditions.

2. The rise in demand, especially from the automotive sector, coupled with a decrease in supply caused by high naphtha cracking costs, has led to significant increases in butadiene prices.

3. The abundance of shale gas has led to a 75% decrease in gas costs compared to 2005, making shale gas an attractive energy source and feedstock for producing transportation fuels and chemicals.

4. The necessity to regenerate catalysts frequently through coke combustion arises due to the inability to prevent coke deposition during the dehydrogenation process.

5. Pt/Al2O3 catalysts tend to sinter more readily in an oxygen-containing atmosphere than in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at temperatures above 600 C.

6. SnO2 species on the catalyst are reduced by the hydrocarbon feed during the dehydrogenation reaction, forming a PtSn alloy.

7. Lowering the space velocity (GHSV) from 3600 to 600 h−1 resulted in an increase in ethane conversion from 27.6% to 31.4%, while ethylene selectivity decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%.

8. In the presence of hydrogen during anoxic dehydrogenation, Cr3+ species on the catalyst were found to be reduced to Cr2+.

9. Catalysts based on porous chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate materials achieved ethane conversions of 18.1% with a propylene selectivity of 87.1% at 550 C.

10. Some catalysts based on layered double hydroxide precursors achieved ethane conversions of 27–30% and ethylene selectivity of 71–75% at 550 C.

1. 近年来，除欧元区外，轻质烯烃特别是丙烯的需求持续增长，这是由于经济衰退的影响。丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异，这表明当前市场条件非常有利。

2. 需求的增长，尤其是汽车行业的推动，以及由于高石蜡裂解成本导致的供应减少，已经导致丁二烯价格急剧上涨。

3. 石油页岩气的丰富使得天然气成本降低了约75%，与2005年的价格相比，这让页岩气作为能源来源和生产交通燃料或化学品的原料变得极具吸引力。

4. 由于无法完全防止沉积焦炭，催化剂需要通过燃烧焦炭进行频繁再生。

5. 在600°C以上的氧气气氛中，Pt/Al2O3催化剂比在氢气气氛中更容易发生聚集。

6. 催化剂上的SnO2物种在脱氢反应过程中或预还原步骤中被所含的碳氢化合物还原，形成PtSn合金。

7. 将空间速度（GHSV）从3600降低到600 h−1，乙烷转化率从27.6%增加到31.4%，而乙烯选择性则从91.7%下降到64.9%。

8. 在无氧脱氢过程中，通过氢气产生的氢气将催化剂上的Cr3+物种还原为Cr2+。

9. 基于孔隙氧化锆-磷灰石材料的催化剂实现了在550°C时18.1%的乙烷转化率和87.1%的丙烯选择性。

10. 一些基于层状双羟基前体的催化剂在550°C时实现了27%-30%的乙烷转化率和71%-75%的乙烯选择性。
