[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[3] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[6] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[7] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[8] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[9] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[10] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
[11] "Literally dozens of new installations have been planned or are already under construction, amounting to an additional 14 million tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018."

1. The chemical industry heavily relies on light olefins like propylene and ethylene as fundamental building blocks. The petrochemical sector faces challenges due to high energy demands, low selectivity in olefin production, depletion of petroleum resources, and escalating oil prices, prompting a quest for more cost-effective feedstocks and efficient conversion methods.

2. The demand for these building blocks has consistently grown over the past years, except in the Eurozone, which experienced negative growth due to economic downturns. The cost of natural gas has dropped by about 75% compared to 2005 prices, making shale gas an attractive source for both energy and chemical production.

3. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including ethane and propane, which can be easily separated from the natural gas. This has transformed the US into the world's leading low-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East.

4. The abundance of relatively inexpensive ethane has prompted a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with new ethane crackers being built and existing naphtha crackers being repurposed or decommissioned.

5. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, which has benefited from favorable market conditions.

6. The rising demand for butadiene, driven by the automotive sector, coupled with a decrease in supply due to high naphtha cracking costs, has led to significant price hikes.

7. The global demand for propylene reached 103 million tons, with forecasts predicting a 45% annual increase.

8. Plans for dozens of new propylene production installations are underway, with a total capacity of 14 million additional tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018.

1. 化学工业广泛依赖轻烯烃，如丙烯和乙烯，作为基本构建块。石油化学部门面临高能源需求、特定烯烃生产选择性低、石油资源枯竭和油价上涨等挑战，促使寻找更经济的原料和更高效的转化技术。

2. 这些构建块的需求在过去几年中稳步增长，除了欧元区，该地区由于经济衰退而出现负增长。与2005年价格相比，天然气成本下降了约75%，使得页岩气成为能源和化学品生产的有吸引力来源。

3. 页岩气蕴藏了大量的天然气液体（NGL），包括乙烷和丙烷，这些液体可以从天然气中轻易分离出来。这使美国成为除中东以外的世界最大低成本化学生产商。

4. 大量的相对便宜的乙烷导致美国从传统的基于石脑油的蒸汽裂解转向乙烷裂解，新建的乙烷裂解器正在建设中，而现有的石脑油裂解器则被重新配置或拆除。

5. 环境因素导致的丙烷脱氢盈利能力在很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差距，这得益于有利的市场条件。

6. 由于汽车行业的增长需求以及石脑油裂解成本高昂导致的供应减少，丁二烯的价格出现了大幅上涨。

7. 全球丙烯需求达到1.03亿吨，预计每年增长45%。

8. 计划中的几十个新的丙烯生产安装项目正在进行中，到2018年每年将新增1400万吨丙烯产能。
