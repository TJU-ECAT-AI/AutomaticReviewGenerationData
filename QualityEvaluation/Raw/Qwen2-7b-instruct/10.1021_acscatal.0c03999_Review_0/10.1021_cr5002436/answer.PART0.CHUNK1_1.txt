[1] "The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative method that does not suffer from thermodynamic limitations faced by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "In ODHP, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. Oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Oxygen does not lead to coke deposition, reduces the reaction temperature to about 400°C, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, it requires avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[3] "On the other hand, CO2 is a milder oxidant, can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, keeps the dehydrogenation reaction endothermic, and may result in additional coke deposition due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction. CO2 competes with hydrogen for adsorption on the catalyst surface, potentially negatively affecting the catalyst's performance."
[4] "Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for developing an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[5] "One alternative solution is the use of solid oxygen carriers, which selectively oxidize the hydrogen evolved by the steam hydrocarbon conversion (SHC) reaction. These carriers can help remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shift the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product, and provide a pathway for hydrogen combustion."
[6] "However, these oxygen carriers face challenges such as low reaction rates, toxicity, and the need for frequent regeneration with oxygen. These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."
[7] "Another method involves the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. Membranes allow hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach can increase olefin yields, but faces challenges such as the inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes, and the issue of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition."
[8] "Operando spectroscopy techniques, such as UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy, can be used to monitor non-invasively the amount and type of coke as it forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface. This can help dynamically adjust the duration of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases to keep the catalyst in its most active state."

Propylene production methods face challenges of high energy consumption, limited conversion, and side reactions at high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative method that avoids thermodynamic limitations. Oxygen and CO2 are key oxidizing agents, each with pros and cons. Oxygen reduces temperature and makes the reaction exothermic, but requires careful management to avoid overoxidation. CO2 keeps the reaction endothermic but can lead to additional coke deposition and hydrogen competition. Solid oxygen carriers and membranes can remove hydrogen and shift equilibrium, but have challenges like low rates, toxicity, and permeability-selectivity trade-offs. Operando spectroscopy helps monitor coke formation and optimize process control.
