          [1] "The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, along with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (shale gas) and producing pure olefins without the need for costly FCC or steam cracking processes."
          [2] "The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures."
          [3] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."

          Propylene production faces challenges including high energy demands, low selectivity for specific olefins, and declining petroleum reserves, coupled with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by utilizing a more economical feedstock, shale gas, and generating pure olefins without the need for expensive FCC or steam cracking processes. Ethane, a relatively inexpensive natural gas liquid, has led to a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with ethane crackers being established and naphtha crackers either dismantled or repurposed.

          当前丙烯生产方法面临的挑战包括高能耗、特定烯烃选择性低以及石油储量减少，加上油价上涨。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更经济的原料——页岩气，并生成纯烯烃，无需昂贵的FCC或蒸汽裂化过程，解决了这些问题。乙烷，一种相对廉价的天然气液体，导致美国从传统的基于石脑油的蒸汽裂解转向乙烷裂解，建立了乙烷裂解器，而石脑油裂解器则被拆卸或重新配置。

          [4] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
          [5] "The demand for these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [6] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."

          The profitability of propane dehydrogenation largely hinges on the price disparity between propane and propylene, creating favorable market conditions. The demand for these foundational components has steadily grown over the past years, with all major markets experiencing positive growth in demand and production, except for the Eurozone, due to the aftermath of recent economic downturns. In the past few years, numerous new PDH projects have been announced, with proposed or ongoing installations utilizing either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts.

          [7] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
          [8] "The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
          [9] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

          Light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are critical components in the chemical industry due to their widespread use as building blocks. The proposed or ongoing installations will utilize either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts, which have been developed to the stage where they can operate continuously for several years. Although current dehydrogenation technologies have made progress, there is still room for improvement, necessitating further developments aimed at reducing noble metal usage, enhancing catalyst stability, and/or optimizing energy efficiency in the dehydrogenation process.

          [10] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
          [11] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
          [12] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."

          The rise in demand, particularly from the automotive sector, coupled with a reduction in supply due to high naphtha cracking costs, has led to significant increases in butadiene prices. This has consequently spurred investments in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) facilities in the US, China, and Japan. As of 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced using deliberate techniques, whereas fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking dominated propylene production.
