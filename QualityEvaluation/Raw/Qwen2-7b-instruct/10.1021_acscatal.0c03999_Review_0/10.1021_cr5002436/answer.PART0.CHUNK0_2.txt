[1] "Increased demand, especially from the automotive industry, combined with a decrease in supply due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, has resulted in sharp increases in butadiene prices."
[2] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[3] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."

Propylene production faces challenges due to high energy demands, low selectivity, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more economical feedstock and efficient conversion technology. Sharp increases in butadiene prices, driven by demand from the automotive industry and a decrease in naphtha cracking supply, have prompted investments in new butane dehydrogenation installations in the US, China, and Japan. Currently, about 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually through PDH processes, but this is anticipated to grow significantly in the future with numerous new installations announced worldwide.

由于高能源需求、低选择性、石油储量减少和油价上涨，丙烯生产面临挑战。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更经济的原料和更高效的转化技术来解决这些问题。汽车工业需求的增加以及裂解汽油供应的减少导致丁二烯价格大幅上涨，从而推动了美国、中国和日本对新丁烷脱氢装置的投资。目前，每年通过PDH工艺生产约500万吨丙烯，但预计随着全球数十个新安装项目在未来几年的宣布和建设，这一数字将显著增长。
