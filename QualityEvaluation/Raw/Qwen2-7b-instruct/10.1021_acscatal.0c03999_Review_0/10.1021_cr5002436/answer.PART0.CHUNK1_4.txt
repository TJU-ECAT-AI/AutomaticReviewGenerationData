[1] "Due to the recent surge in shale gas production, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[3] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[6] "Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[7] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."
[8] "The reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2 → H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol−1))."
[9] "Nevertheless, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2 → H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol−1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[10] "Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital investment costs, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process that utilizes lower temperatures and pressures. This method also presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP allows for full conversion of propane to propylene without the need for hydrogen, which is a major advantage. However, the use of oxygen also introduces challenges related to coke formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as oxygen is the most commonly used but can lead to coke formation, while other milder oxidants like carbon dioxide may require additional measures to mitigate the risk of coke formation.

Alternative catalysts such as metal oxides like gallium oxide (GaOx), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (VOx) have been explored as potential replacements for the noble metals used in conventional dehydrogenation catalysts. These alternatives have not yet been fully developed due to their rapid deactivation, mainly caused by coke deposition and the inability to fully recover catalyst activity through regeneration. However, advancements are expected in areas like oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not suffer from the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, and the use of solid oxygen carriers, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved by the shift hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction. These methods aim to overcome the drawbacks of ODHP by addressing issues like coke formation and the need for a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent.

Despite the progress made in developing more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes, there is still room for improvement in terms of reducing the noble metal loading, increasing catalyst stability, and enhancing energy efficiency. This requires further research and development to optimize catalyst performance, selectivity, and durability.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高昂的资本投资成本和环境问题。氧化脱氢法通过提供更节能的过程，利用较低的温度和压力来解决这些问题。这种方法还存在一系列优势和限制，尤其是在氧化剂选择方面的考虑。使用氧气作为氧化剂在氧化脱氢法中允许完全将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需氢气，这是其主要优势。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如焦炭形成可能导致催化剂失活。选择合适的氧化剂是氧化脱氢的关键，氧气是最常用的，但可能导致焦炭形成，而其他较温和的氧化剂如二氧化碳可能需要额外措施来减少焦炭形成的风险。

诸如镓氧化物（GaOx）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（VOx）等替代催化剂已被探索用作常规脱氢催化剂的潜在替代品。这些替代品尚未完全开发，主要是由于它们快速失活，主要原因是焦炭沉积以及无法通过再生完全恢复催化剂活性。然而，在领域内预期有进展，例如氧化脱氢，它没有非氧化脱氢的热力学限制，并且使用固体氧载体的方法，可以选择性地氧化由移位氢燃烧（SHC）反应产生的氢。这些方法旨在通过解决焦炭形成和选择合适的催化剂材料与氧化剂组合的问题来克服氧化脱氢的缺点。

尽管在开发更高效和可持续的脱氢过程方面取得了进步，但仍存在改进空间，以减少贵金属负载、提高催化剂稳定性并增强能效。这需要进一步的研究和发展来优化催化剂性能、选择性和耐用性。
