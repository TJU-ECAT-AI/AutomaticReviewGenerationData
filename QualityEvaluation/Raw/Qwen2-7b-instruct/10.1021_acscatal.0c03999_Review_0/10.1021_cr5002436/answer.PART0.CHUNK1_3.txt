[1] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[2] "However, it is important to note that catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used. Notably, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations, despite the fact that the latter are commonly used at higher space velocities, which highlights the remarkable stability of Pt catalysts."
[3] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[4] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."

1. 近几十年来，镓氧化物、钼氧化物和钒氧化物等金属氧化物得到了大量关注，但还没有找到可以替代铂锡和铬氧化物系统的方法。
2. 金属氧化物基催化剂比铂催化剂更快失活，尽管在铂催化剂使用较高空速时这一点尤为明显，这突显了铂催化剂的卓越稳定性。
3. 近年来，许多新的PDH项目被宣布或正在建设中，采用的催化剂包括铬氧化物/氧化铝（Catofin）或铂锡/氧化铝（Oleflex），这些催化剂技术已经发展到可以在数年内连续运行的地步。
4. 当前的脱氢化技术仍有改进空间，需要进一步努力降低贵金属负载、提高催化剂稳定性并优化脱氢化过程的能量效率。
