The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, include high capital costs, environmental concerns, and the need for large energy inputs. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative by converting propane directly into propylene with oxygen as the oxidizing agent. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, especially in selecting the appropriate oxidant and addressing the specific challenges related to oxygen usage. 

Oxygen can be selected as the oxidant in ODHP because it is abundant and affordable. Yet, the use of oxygen introduces several challenges. Oxygen can lead to overoxidation of hydrocarbons, affecting olefin selectivity. Additionally, oxygen can compete with hydrogen, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the dehydrogenation reaction. Moreover, oxygen combustion produces heat, which can balance the highly endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. However, oxygen combustion can also lead to the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), contributing to environmental concerns.

One specific challenge associated with using oxygen is the risk of forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) during the reaction, which can impact environmental sustainability. Another challenge is the potential for oxygen to compete with hydrogen, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the dehydrogenation reaction. Despite these challenges, the benefits of using oxygen in ODHP, such as its abundance and affordability, make it an attractive option for propylene production.

To mitigate the risks of oxygen combustion and competition with hydrogen, researchers might explore alternative oxidants with milder oxidizing power, such as carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is less reactive than oxygen, which could minimize the formation of nitrogen oxides and reduce competition with hydrogen. However, CO2 is a much milder oxidant, and its use requires careful consideration to ensure that it can effectively consume hydrogen without compromising the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. This requires finding a suitable balance between oxygen and CO2 to achieve optimal propylene production while minimizing environmental impact.

In summary, the choice of oxidant in ODHP involves balancing the need for oxygen's abundance and affordability against the risks of overoxidation, competition with hydrogen, and environmental concerns. Researchers are actively exploring alternative oxidants and strategies to optimize the ODHP process, aiming to enhance propylene production efficiency while maintaining environmental sustainability.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高昂的资本成本、环境问题以及对大量能量输入的需求。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）提供了一种可能更高效和环境友好的替代方案，通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，使用氧气作为氧化剂。然而，ODHP也面临一系列挑战，尤其是在选择合适的氧化剂和解决与氧气使用相关的问题时。

氧气可以作为ODHP的选择氧化剂，因为它丰富且经济实惠。然而，氧气的使用引入了一系列挑战。氧气可能导致烃类过氧化，影响烯烃选择性。此外，氧气可能会与氢竞争，可能降低脱氢反应的有效性。另一方面，氧气燃烧产生的热量可以平衡脱氢反应的高度吸热特性。然而，氧气燃烧也可能导致氮氧化物（NOx）的形成，增加环境问题。

与氧气使用相关的具体挑战是氧气燃烧的风险，可能导致氮氧化物（NOx）的形成，这影响环境可持续性。另一个挑战是氧气可能与氢竞争，可能降低脱氢反应的有效性。尽管存在这些挑战，氧气在ODHP中的优势，如其丰富性和经济性，使其成为丙烯生产的一个有吸引力的选择。

为减少氧气燃烧风险和氢的竞争，研究人员可能探索使用更温和氧化性的替代氧化剂，例如二氧化碳（CO2）。CO2比氧气不那么活泼，这可以减少氮氧化物的形成和氢的竞争。然而，CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂，其使用需要仔细考虑，以确保它能够有效消耗氢而不损害脱氢过程的效率。这需要找到氧气和CO2之间的平衡，以实现最优的丙烯生产，同时保持环境影响的最小化。

综上所述，ODHP中氧化剂的选择涉及平衡氧气的丰富性和经济性与其过氧化的风险、氢的竞争以及环境问题的关系。研究人员正在积极探索替代氧化剂和优化ODHP过程的战略，旨在提高丙烯生产效率的同时维持环境可持续性。

[1] "Because of their extensive use as chemical building blocks, light olefins, such as propylene (propene) and ethylene (ethene), are among the most important types of compounds in the chemical industry."
[2] "Light olefins are the feedstock employed in the production of a vast array of chemicals, including polymers (e.g., polyethylene and polypropylene), oxygenates (e.g., ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and propylene oxide), and important chemical intermediates (e.g., ethylbenzene and propionaldehyde)."
[3] "In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown. These (predicted) numbers originate from ref. 7."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."
[5] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[6] "An additional advantage of dehydrogenation technologies is that dehydrogenation is an on-purpose technique, which yields exclusively a particular olefin instead of a mixture of products."
[7] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[8] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[9] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[10] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[11] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
[12] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[13] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and diminishing petroleum reserves, along with rising oil prices. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more economical feedstock (shale gas) and producing pure olefins without the need for costly FCC or steam cracking processes. The use of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane as feedstocks is advantageous due to their ready availability and the drop in gas costs. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is high because of the significant price difference between propane and propylene, making it a lucrative market. The dehydrogenation process is an on-purpose technique that yields exclusively olefins, unlike the mixture of products obtained from traditional cracking methods. The use of shale gas as a feedstock is particularly advantageous due to its abundant supply and lower costs, making it an attractive alternative for producing transportation fuels or chemicals. This trend is expected to continue, with dozens of new PDH installations planned or under construction worldwide. The investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations in countries like the US, China, and Japan is a testament to the favorable market conditions for dehydrogenation technologies.

[1] "The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, limited equilibrium conversion, and the prevalence of side reactions at high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative method that does not suffer from thermodynamic limitations faced by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "In ODHP, an oxidant combusts the hydrogen formed during reaction, allowing for full conversion of the paraffin. Oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO2) have been the most investigated oxidizing agents, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Oxygen does not lead to coke deposition, reduces the reaction temperature to about 400°C, and makes the dehydrogenation reaction exothermic. However, it requires avoiding overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[3] "On the other hand, CO2 is a milder oxidant, can effectively consume hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, keeps the dehydrogenation reaction endothermic, and may result in additional coke deposition due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction. CO2 competes with hydrogen for adsorption on the catalyst surface, potentially negatively affecting the catalyst's performance."
[4] "Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent is crucial for developing an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[5] "One alternative solution is the use of solid oxygen carriers, which selectively oxidize the hydrogen evolved by the steam hydrocarbon conversion (SHC) reaction. These carriers can help remove hydrogen from the reaction mixture, shift the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product, and provide a pathway for hydrogen combustion."
[6] "However, these oxygen carriers face challenges such as low reaction rates, toxicity, and the need for frequent regeneration with oxygen. These issues need to be resolved for this approach to become viable for industrial application."
[7] "Another method involves the introduction of membranes to the reactor system. Membranes allow hydrogen to diffuse out of the reactor, shifting the equilibrium towards the desired olefin product. This approach can increase olefin yields, but faces challenges such as the inverse relationship between permeability and selectivity of the membranes, and the issue of catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition."
[8] "Operando spectroscopy techniques, such as UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy, can be used to monitor non-invasively the amount and type of coke as it forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface. This can help dynamically adjust the duration of dehydrogenation and regeneration phases to keep the catalyst in its most active state."

Propylene production methods face challenges of high energy consumption, limited conversion, and side reactions at high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers an alternative method that avoids thermodynamic limitations. Oxygen and CO2 are key oxidizing agents, each with pros and cons. Oxygen reduces temperature and makes the reaction exothermic, but requires careful management to avoid overoxidation. CO2 keeps the reaction endothermic but can lead to additional coke deposition and hydrogen competition. Solid oxygen carriers and membranes can remove hydrogen and shift equilibrium, but have challenges like low rates, toxicity, and permeability-selectivity trade-offs. Operando spectroscopy helps monitor coke formation and optimize process control.

[1] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[2] "As of this writing, ca. 5 million tons of propylene is produced annually by propane dehydrogenation (PDH)."
[3] "The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[5] "As was shown in the previous section, two strategies have been adopted in industry to lower paraffin partial pressure, reducing the pressure below atmospheric (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process)."
[6] "Indeed, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of paraffins is related to SHC by the fact that an oxidant is also added to the feed, although in ODH the latter is done to directly oxidize the paraffin to the respective olefin."
[7] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."

Propylene production primarily faces challenges related to high energy demands, low selectivity towards specific olefins, and limited petroleum reserves. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient conversion process. The use of oxygen presents a challenge in selecting the appropriate oxidant, as it must effectively oxidize paraffins without excessively combusting the hydrocarbon reactants or products. Oxygen's reactivity necessitates careful management to ensure selective oxidation. The specific challenges associated with ODHP involve optimizing the reaction conditions to achieve high selectivity and yield, while minimizing side reactions like cracking and hydrogenolysis. 

The dehydrogenation process is thermodynamically limited, requiring higher temperatures and lower partial pressures of paraffins for high conversions. Industries have adopted strategies such as reducing pressure below atmospheric (Catofin) or diluting the paraffin feed with steam (STAR process) to mitigate these limitations. 

In comparison, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) offers an exothermic reaction that is not equilibrium limited. However, controlling side reactions like cracking and excessive oxidation of products remains a significant challenge. The addition of an oxidant, such as oxygen, directly oxidizes paraffins to olefins, differing from the non-oxidative process which primarily focuses on dehydrogenation. 

Due to the complexity of the dehydrogenation mechanism, calculating turnover frequency (TOF) for catalysts is challenging. The dispersion values of the active phase (platinum) are often not available in the literature, making it difficult to precisely quantify the catalyst's performance in terms of reaction rate.

目前丙烯生产主要面临高能需求、低选择性以及有限的石油储备等挑战。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，提供更高效的转化过程。在选择合适的氧化剂时，需要考虑氧气的有效氧化作用，同时避免过度燃烧反应物或产物。氧气的活性要求精心管理以确保选择性氧化。ODHP面临的特定挑战是优化反应条件以实现高选择性和产率，同时尽量减少副反应如裂解和氢化。

脱氢过程从热力学角度来看是有限制的，需要更高的温度和更低的烷烃分压来实现高转化率。工业界已采用策略，如将压力降至大气以下（Catofin）或用蒸汽稀释烷烃进料（STAR过程），以缓解这些限制。

相比之下，氧化脱氢（ODH）提供了一个放热反应，不是平衡限制的。然而，控制副反应如裂解和产品过氧化仍然是一个重大挑战。直接向进料中添加氧化剂，如氧气，可以氧化烷烃为烯烃，这与主要关注脱氢的非氧化过程不同。

由于脱氢机制的复杂性，计算催化剂的周转频率（TOF）具有挑战性。活性相（铂）的分散值在文献中往往不可用，这使得精确量化催化剂性能，特别是在反应速率方面的计算变得困难。

1. The chemical industry heavily relies on light olefins like propylene and ethylene as fundamental building blocks. The petrochemical sector faces challenges due to high energy demands, low selectivity in olefin production, depletion of petroleum resources, and escalating oil prices, prompting a quest for more cost-effective feedstocks and efficient conversion methods.

2. The demand for these building blocks has consistently grown over the past years, except in the Eurozone, which experienced negative growth due to economic downturns. The cost of natural gas has dropped by about 75% compared to 2005 prices, making shale gas an attractive source for both energy and chemical production.

3. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGLs), including ethane and propane, which can be easily separated from the natural gas. This has transformed the US into the world's leading low-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East.

4. The abundance of relatively inexpensive ethane has prompted a shift from traditional naphtha-based steam cracking to ethane cracking in the US, with new ethane crackers being built and existing naphtha crackers being repurposed or decommissioned.

5. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, which has benefited from favorable market conditions.

6. The rising demand for butadiene, driven by the automotive sector, coupled with a decrease in supply due to high naphtha cracking costs, has led to significant price hikes.

7. The global demand for propylene reached 103 million tons, with forecasts predicting a 45% annual increase.

8. Plans for dozens of new propylene production installations are underway, with a total capacity of 14 million additional tons of propylene to be produced annually by 2018.

[1] "Due to the recent surge in shale gas production, alternative methods for obtaining olefins, dehydrogenation and MTO, have become very competitive relative to more traditional methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking."
[2] "The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts. These catalysts and technologies have been advanced to a point where the reaction can be run continuously for several years."
[3] "Nevertheless, current dehydrogenation technologies still offer room for improvement, and thus further advances are needed to lower noble metal loading, increase catalyst stability, and/or improve the energy efficiency of the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "These alternative formulations deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[6] "Nevertheless, advancements can also be expected in other areas. Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[7] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."
[8] "The reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2 → H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol−1))."
[9] "Nevertheless, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2 → H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol−1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."
[10] "Indeed, for both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital investment costs, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process that utilizes lower temperatures and pressures. This method also presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP allows for full conversion of propane to propylene without the need for hydrogen, which is a major advantage. However, the use of oxygen also introduces challenges related to coke formation, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. The selection of the oxidant is crucial in ODHP, as oxygen is the most commonly used but can lead to coke formation, while other milder oxidants like carbon dioxide may require additional measures to mitigate the risk of coke formation.

Alternative catalysts such as metal oxides like gallium oxide (GaOx), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), and vanadium oxide (VOx) have been explored as potential replacements for the noble metals used in conventional dehydrogenation catalysts. These alternatives have not yet been fully developed due to their rapid deactivation, mainly caused by coke deposition and the inability to fully recover catalyst activity through regeneration. However, advancements are expected in areas like oxidative dehydrogenation, which does not suffer from the thermodynamic limitations of nonoxidative dehydrogenation, and the use of solid oxygen carriers, which can selectively oxidize hydrogen evolved by the shift hydrogen combustion (SHC) reaction. These methods aim to overcome the drawbacks of ODHP by addressing issues like coke formation and the need for a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent.

Despite the progress made in developing more efficient and sustainable dehydrogenation processes, there is still room for improvement in terms of reducing the noble metal loading, increasing catalyst stability, and enhancing energy efficiency. This requires further research and development to optimize catalyst performance, selectivity, and durability.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、高昂的资本投资成本和环境问题。氧化脱氢法通过提供更节能的过程，利用较低的温度和压力来解决这些问题。这种方法还存在一系列优势和限制，尤其是在氧化剂选择方面的考虑。使用氧气作为氧化剂在氧化脱氢法中允许完全将丙烷转化为丙烯，无需氢气，这是其主要优势。然而，使用氧气也带来了挑战，如焦炭形成可能导致催化剂失活。选择合适的氧化剂是氧化脱氢的关键，氧气是最常用的，但可能导致焦炭形成，而其他较温和的氧化剂如二氧化碳可能需要额外措施来减少焦炭形成的风险。

诸如镓氧化物（GaOx）、钼氧化物（MoOx）和钒氧化物（VOx）等替代催化剂已被探索用作常规脱氢催化剂的潜在替代品。这些替代品尚未完全开发，主要是由于它们快速失活，主要原因是焦炭沉积以及无法通过再生完全恢复催化剂活性。然而，在领域内预期有进展，例如氧化脱氢，它没有非氧化脱氢的热力学限制，并且使用固体氧载体的方法，可以选择性地氧化由移位氢燃烧（SHC）反应产生的氢。这些方法旨在通过解决焦炭形成和选择合适的催化剂材料与氧化剂组合的问题来克服氧化脱氢的缺点。

尽管在开发更高效和可持续的脱氢过程方面取得了进步，但仍存在改进空间，以减少贵金属负载、提高催化剂稳定性并增强能效。这需要进一步的研究和发展来优化催化剂性能、选择性和耐用性。
