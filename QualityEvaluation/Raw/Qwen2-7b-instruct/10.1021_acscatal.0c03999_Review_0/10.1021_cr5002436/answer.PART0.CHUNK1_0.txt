[1] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Brnsted acid and others active sites of the catalysts serve as seeding points to which olefins and paraffins are added until large graphitic structures are formed."
[2] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[3] "Several strategies have been applied to control coke formation. For example, coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, such as fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking, include high capital costs, environmental concerns, and the need for large energy inputs. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative by converting propane directly into propylene with oxygen as the oxidizing agent. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, especially in selecting the appropriate oxidant and addressing the specific challenges related to oxygen usage. 

Oxygen can be selected as the oxidant in ODHP because it is abundant and affordable. Yet, the use of oxygen introduces several challenges. Oxygen can lead to overoxidation of hydrocarbons, affecting olefin selectivity. Additionally, oxygen can compete with hydrogen, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the dehydrogenation reaction. Moreover, oxygen combustion produces heat, which can balance the highly endothermic nature of the dehydrogenation reaction. However, oxygen combustion can also lead to the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), contributing to environmental concerns.

One specific challenge associated with using oxygen is the risk of forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) during the reaction, which can impact environmental sustainability. Another challenge is the potential for oxygen to compete with hydrogen, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the dehydrogenation reaction. Despite these challenges, the benefits of using oxygen in ODHP, such as its abundance and affordability, make it an attractive option for propylene production.

To mitigate the risks of oxygen combustion and competition with hydrogen, researchers might explore alternative oxidants with milder oxidizing power, such as carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is less reactive than oxygen, which could minimize the formation of nitrogen oxides and reduce competition with hydrogen. However, CO2 is a much milder oxidant, and its use requires careful consideration to ensure that it can effectively consume hydrogen without compromising the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process. This requires finding a suitable balance between oxygen and CO2 to achieve optimal propylene production while minimizing environmental impact.

In summary, the choice of oxidant in ODHP involves balancing the need for oxygen's abundance and affordability against the risks of overoxidation, competition with hydrogen, and environmental concerns. Researchers are actively exploring alternative oxidants and strategies to optimize the ODHP process, aiming to enhance propylene production efficiency while maintaining environmental sustainability.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高昂的资本成本、环境问题以及对大量能量输入的需求。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）提供了一种可能更高效和环境友好的替代方案，通过直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，使用氧气作为氧化剂。然而，ODHP也面临一系列挑战，尤其是在选择合适的氧化剂和解决与氧气使用相关的问题时。

氧气可以作为ODHP的选择氧化剂，因为它丰富且经济实惠。然而，氧气的使用引入了一系列挑战。氧气可能导致烃类过氧化，影响烯烃选择性。此外，氧气可能会与氢竞争，可能降低脱氢反应的有效性。另一方面，氧气燃烧产生的热量可以平衡脱氢反应的高度吸热特性。然而，氧气燃烧也可能导致氮氧化物（NOx）的形成，增加环境问题。

与氧气使用相关的具体挑战是氧气燃烧的风险，可能导致氮氧化物（NOx）的形成，这影响环境可持续性。另一个挑战是氧气可能与氢竞争，可能降低脱氢反应的有效性。尽管存在这些挑战，氧气在ODHP中的优势，如其丰富性和经济性，使其成为丙烯生产的一个有吸引力的选择。

为减少氧气燃烧风险和氢的竞争，研究人员可能探索使用更温和氧化性的替代氧化剂，例如二氧化碳（CO2）。CO2比氧气不那么活泼，这可以减少氮氧化物的形成和氢的竞争。然而，CO2是一种较弱的氧化剂，其使用需要仔细考虑，以确保它能够有效消耗氢而不损害脱氢过程的效率。这需要找到氧气和CO2之间的平衡，以实现最优的丙烯生产，同时保持环境影响的最小化。

综上所述，ODHP中氧化剂的选择涉及平衡氧气的丰富性和经济性与其过氧化的风险、氢的竞争以及环境问题的关系。研究人员正在积极探索替代氧化剂和优化ODHP过程的战略，旨在提高丙烯生产效率的同时维持环境可持续性。
