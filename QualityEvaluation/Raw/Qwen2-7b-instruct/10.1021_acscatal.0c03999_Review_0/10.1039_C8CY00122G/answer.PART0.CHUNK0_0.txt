What are the primary challenges in current propylene production methods, and how does oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) address these issues while presenting its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen?

The emerging conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves, which contain copious amounts of ethane and propane,offer a huge potential for the manufacture of value-added chemicals and fuels.1-3 However, less than 10% of the global natural gas production is used for the production of commodities, while 3.5%, a fraction that is worth ca. 13 billion USD, is flared at oil and gas fields or refineries.4-6 The significant share ( 30%) of the world’s natural gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas and their prohibitive shipping costs to centralised cracking and/or reforming megaplants are among the main reasons for its limited use as chemical feedstock.4,7-9 This situation necessitates the development of alternative upgrading processes that can be implemented in compact plants amenable to decentralisation.4,8 Among various proposed routes as partial oxidation,10,11 catalytic dehydrogenation,1 and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes,12,13 halogen-mediated pathways are attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure.2

Despite these results, only few studies have tackled ethane and, especially, propane oxybromination. In essence, FeCl3-based and (VO)2P2O7 catalysts have been discovered, showing preferential formation of bromoalkanes ( 90% and 85% selectivity to C2H5Br, respectively) instead of the corresponding olefins ( 20% and 65% selectivity to ethylene, respectively),24,25 contrasting the observations gathered in alkane oxychlorination.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low efficiency in converting natural gas to commodities, high cost of centralized processing, and waste of a significant portion of natural gas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by enabling the selective activation of light hydrocarbons, such as propane, under mild conditions, making it suitable for decentralized processing. However, ODHP faces challenges in oxidant selection and managing the production of unwanted byproducts. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP presents advantages such as high reactivity and availability, but also challenges like safety concerns and potential formation of carbon oxides as byproducts.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括天然气转化成商品的效率低、集中处理成本高以及大量天然气的浪费。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过在温和条件下选择性激活轻烃，如丙烷，解决了这些问题，并使其适合分散式处理。然而，ODHP在氧化剂选择和管理副产品的产生方面面临着挑战。将氧气用作ODHP的氧化剂具有优势，如高反应性和可用性，但也存在安全问题和可能形成碳氧化物副产品的挑战。
