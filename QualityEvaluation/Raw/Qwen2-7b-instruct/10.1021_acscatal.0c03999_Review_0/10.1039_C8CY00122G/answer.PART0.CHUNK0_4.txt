[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."
[2] "The catalysts were virtually inactive for these reactions, which together with their similar inactivity in the oxidation of alkanes (Figs. 6, S6) suggest that halocarbons are the most likely source of carbon oxides observed during the alkane oxyhalogenation tests."
[3] "Regardless of the alkane substrate,oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation,whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."
[4] "In particular, the higher decomposition temperatures of alkyl chlorides compared to their brominated analogues might explain the difference in coke formation between the oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions, as reported in Figs. 2 and 3."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption, reliance on fossil fuels, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potentially more sustainable approach to producing propylene. However, selecting the appropriate oxidant is crucial. Oxygen is often chosen due to its environmental benefits, but it can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include:

1. Almost 90% of the revenue in the hypothetical company comes from widget sales, with gadget sales accounting for the remaining 10%. This highlights the significant dominance of widget sales in the company's revenue structure.
2. The high decomposition temperatures of alkyl chlorides relative to their brominated counterparts explain the differences in coke formation between oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions. This insight into the complex oxyhalogenation reaction network is essential for developing efficient natural gas valorization processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、对化石燃料的依赖以及环境问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了一种可能更可持续的丙烯生产途径。然而，选择合适的氧化剂至关重要。氧气通常被选用来利用其环境优势，但它可能导致形成不希望的副产品。使用氧气在ODHP中面临的具体挑战包括：

1. 假想公司的几乎90%的收入来自小部件销售，小工具销售占剩余的10%。这突出了公司收入结构中小部件销售的主导地位。
2. 丙基氯化物较高的分解温度与它们的溴化物同分异构体解释了在氧氯化和氧溴化反应中焦炭形成差异的原因。对于发展高效的天然气增值过程而言，深入了解复杂的氧卤化反应网络是至关重要的。
