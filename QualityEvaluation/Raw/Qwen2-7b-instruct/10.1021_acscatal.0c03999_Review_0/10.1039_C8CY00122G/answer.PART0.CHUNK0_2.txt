[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."

[2] "The oxyhalogenation of alkanes might proceed through the formation of the alkyl halide followed by its dehydrohalogenation to yield the corresponding olefin, although the halogenating agent (i.e., molecular halogen, halide and/or catalyst) seems to differ depending on the halide type."

[3] "On the other hand, in the case of alkyl bromide dehydrobromination, the operating temperature window is much closer to that of oxybromination. Therefore, higher selectivity to alkyl bromides was attained, particularly in the low temperature window of this reaction."

[4] "Regardless of the alkane substrate, oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation, whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."

[5] "The catalysts were virtually inactive for these reactions, which together with their similar inactivity in the oxidation of alkanes (Figs. 6, S6) suggest that halocarbons are the most likely source of carbon oxides observed during the alkane oxyhalogenation tests."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns due to emissions, and the need for expensive catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process, reducing emissions, and potentially utilizing less costly catalysts. In the context of oxidant selection, the use of oxygen presents both advantages and challenges. The advantages include the abundance and relatively low cost of oxygen, while challenges include the need for careful control to prevent unwanted reactions and the potential for increased safety risks. 

The document highlights that the oxyhalogenation process, specifically through the use of europium oxychloride and europium oxybromide catalysts, can lead to different product distributions depending on the halide type used. The oxychlorination process tends to produce olefins, while oxybromination favors the formation of bromocarbons. This difference in product distribution is attributed to the distinct mechanisms of alkane activation and the subsequent reactions leading to the formation of olefins versus bromocarbons. The dehydrohalogenation step plays a crucial role in this process, with the preference for olefin formation being influenced by factors such as the stability of alkyl halides and the kinetics of the dehydrohalogenation versus further halogenation pathways.

In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the catalysts are found to be inactive for the oxidation of propylene or alkanes, suggesting that halocarbons are the predominant source of carbon oxides observed during the oxyhalogenation tests. This implies that the formation of carbon oxides is a natural byproduct of the oxyhalogenation process, which might require further optimization to reduce these emissions or capture and utilize them efficiently.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境问题以及昂贵催化剂的需求。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能的过程、减少排放以及可能使用成本更低的催化剂，解决了这些挑战。在氧化剂选择的背景下，氧气的应用既有利也有弊。其优势在于氧气的丰富性和相对较低的成本，而挑战则包括需要仔细控制以防止意外反应并可能增加安全风险。

文档表明，在不同卤化剂类型的作用下，烷烃的卤代异构化过程会导致不同的产物分布。氯化过程倾向于产生烯烃，而溴化过程有利于形成溴化碳。这种产品分布的不同归因于烷基卤化物生成机制的差异以及随后形成的烯烃与溴化碳之间的反应路径。脱卤化步骤在此过程中起着关键作用，烯烃形成倾向受到诸如烷基卤化物的稳定性以及脱卤化与进一步卤化路径之间动力学的影响。

在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，催化剂对丙烯或烷烃的氧化表现出低活性，暗示卤化碳是观察到的碳氧化物的主要来源。这表明在氧化异构化过程中形成碳氧化物是一个自然副产品，可能需要进一步优化以减少这些排放或有效捕获和利用它们。
