1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and the need for efficient catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially lower energy pathway for propylene production, reducing the dependency on fossil fuels, and potentially minimizing emissions. However, the selection of oxidant is crucial as it affects the energy efficiency and the production cost. Oxygen presents specific challenges due to its reactivity and the need for high pressures to ensure adequate reaction rates. The use of oxygen in ODHP can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, which complicates the separation process and adds to the operational complexity.

2. The main reasons for the difference in product distribution between ethane oxychlorination and propane oxybromination lie in the distinct pathways of alkane activation and subsequent transformation. In ethane oxychlorination, alkane activation primarily occurs on the catalyst surface, leading to olefin formation through dehydrochlorination. In contrast, propane oxybromination involves alkyl bromide formation, which can undergo dehydrobromination or further bromination in the gas phase. The role of the hydrogen halide influences the selectivity as HCl favors olefin formation, while HBr promotes the formation of bromocarbons, particularly at low conversion levels.

3. The catalyst design criteria for methane oxybromination can be applied to ethane and propane oxybromination, emphasizing the importance of catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity under oxyhalogenation conditions. The choice of catalyst, such as europium oxychloride and europium oxybromide, influences the product distribution, with europium oxychloride showing superior stability and activity in ethane oxychlorination, while europium oxybromide excels in methane oxybromination.

4. The higher decomposition temperatures of alkyl chlorides compared to their brominated analogues are due to the stronger C-Cl bonds. This difference influences the differences in coke formation between oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions. In oxychlorination, the formation of coke is less prevalent because alkyl chlorides decompose at higher temperatures, leaving more opportunity for olefin formation. In oxybromination, the decomposition of alkyl bromides occurs at lower temperatures, leading to more coke formation, which can affect the catalyst's lifetime and performance.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境问题以及高效催化剂的需求。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供潜在的较低能效途径来解决这些挑战，降低对化石燃料的依赖，并可能减少排放。然而，氧化剂的选择至关重要，因为它影响能源效率和生产成本。氧气提出了特定的挑战，由于其反应性和需要高压以确保足够反应速率，导致操作复杂性增加。使用氧气在ODHP中可能导致形成副产品的复杂性，这增加了分离过程的难度和运营复杂性。

2. 乙烷氧氯化与丙烷氧溴化之间产品分布差异的主要原因在于烷烃激活和后续转换的不同时路径。在乙烷氧氯化中，烷烃激活主要发生在催化剂表面，导致通过脱氯化形成烯烃。相比之下，在丙烷氧溴化中，首先形成烷基溴化物，随后在气相中可以进行脱溴化或进一步溴化。氢卤酸的作用决定了选择性，HCl倾向于促进烯烃形成，而HBr倾向于促进溴化碳的形成，尤其是在低转化率水平下。

3. 甲烷氧溴化催化剂设计准则可应用于乙烷和丙烷氧溴化，强调在氧卤化条件下催化剂稳定性的关键作用、活性和选择性。例如，选择催化剂如氧化铕和氧化铕，它们影响产物分布，氧化铕在乙烷氧氯化中表现出优越的稳定性和活性，而氧化铕在甲烷氧溴化中表现出优异性能。

4. 烷基氯化物比其溴化同系物更高的分解温度归因于更强的C-Cl键。这种差异影响了氧氯化和氧溴化反应中焦炭形成之间的差异。在氧氯化中，由于烷基氯化物在较高温度下分解，因此有更多机会形成烯烃，从而形成较少的焦炭。在氧溴化中，烷基溴化物在较低温度下分解，导致更多的焦炭形成，这可能影响催化剂的寿命和性能。
