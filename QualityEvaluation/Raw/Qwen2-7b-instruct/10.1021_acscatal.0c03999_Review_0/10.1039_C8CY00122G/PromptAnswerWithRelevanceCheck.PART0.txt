The emerging conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves, which contain copious amounts of ethane and propane,offer a huge potential for the manufacture of value-added chemicals and fuels.1-3 However, less than 10% of the global natural gas production is used for the production of commodities, while 3.5%, a fraction that is worth ca. 13 billion USD, is flared at oil and gas fields or refineries.4-6 The significant share ( 30%) of the world’s natural gas reserves that are located in remote and scattered areas and their prohibitive shipping costs to centralised cracking and/or reforming megaplants are among the main reasons for its limited use as chemical feedstock.4,7-9 This situation necessitates the development of alternative upgrading processes that can be implemented in compact plants amenable to decentralisation.4,8 Among various proposed routes as partial oxidation,10,11 catalytic dehydrogenation,1 and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes,12,13 halogen-mediated pathways are attractive approaches as they enable the selective activation of light hydrocarbons under relatively mild conditions of temperature and pressure.2

Despite these results, only few studies have tackled ethane and, especially, propane oxybromination. In essence, FeCl3-based and (VO)2P2O7 catalysts have been discovered, showing preferential formation of bromoalkanes ( 90% and 85% selectivity to C2H5Br, respectively) instead of the corresponding olefins ( 20% and 65% selectivity to ethylene, respectively),24,25 contrasting the observations gathered in alkane oxychlorination.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include low efficiency in converting natural gas to commodities, high cost of centralized processing, and waste of a significant portion of natural gas. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by enabling the selective activation of light hydrocarbons, such as propane, under mild conditions, making it suitable for decentralized processing. However, ODHP faces challenges in oxidant selection and managing the production of unwanted byproducts. Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP presents advantages such as high reactivity and availability, but also challenges like safety concerns and potential formation of carbon oxides as byproducts.

[1] "Ethane and propane oxyhalogenation were investigated over EuOCl and EuOBr, revealing significant differences in activity and especially in the product distribution as a function of the halide type."

[2] "The oxyhalogenation of alkanes might proceed through the formation of the alkyl halide followed by its dehydrohalogenation to yield the corresponding olefin, although the halogenating agent (i.e., molecular halogen, halide and/or catalyst) seems to differ depending on the halide type."

[3] "On the other hand, in the case of alkyl bromide dehydrobromination, the operating temperature window is much closer to that of oxybromination. Therefore, higher selectivity to alkyl bromides was attained, particularly in the low temperature window of this reaction."

[4] "Regardless of the alkane substrate, oxychlorination preferably leads to olefins generation, whereas oxybromination favours the formation of bromocarbons."

[5] "The catalysts were virtually inactive for these reactions, which together with their similar inactivity in the oxidation of alkanes (Figs. 6, S6) suggest that halocarbons are the most likely source of carbon oxides observed during the alkane oxyhalogenation tests."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns due to emissions, and the need for expensive catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient process, reducing emissions, and potentially utilizing less costly catalysts. In the context of oxidant selection, the use of oxygen presents both advantages and challenges. The advantages include the abundance and relatively low cost of oxygen, while challenges include the need for careful control to prevent unwanted reactions and the potential for increased safety risks. 

The document highlights that the oxyhalogenation process, specifically through the use of europium oxychloride and europium oxybromide catalysts, can lead to different product distributions depending on the halide type used. The oxychlorination process tends to produce olefins, while oxybromination favors the formation of bromocarbons. This difference in product distribution is attributed to the distinct mechanisms of alkane activation and the subsequent reactions leading to the formation of olefins versus bromocarbons. The dehydrohalogenation step plays a crucial role in this process, with the preference for olefin formation being influenced by factors such as the stability of alkyl halides and the kinetics of the dehydrohalogenation versus further halogenation pathways.

In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the catalysts are found to be inactive for the oxidation of propylene or alkanes, suggesting that halocarbons are the predominant source of carbon oxides observed during the oxyhalogenation tests. This implies that the formation of carbon oxides is a natural byproduct of the oxyhalogenation process, which might require further optimization to reduce these emissions or capture and utilize them efficiently.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境问题以及昂贵催化剂的需求。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能的过程、减少排放以及可能使用成本更低的催化剂，解决了这些挑战。在氧化剂选择的背景下，氧气的应用既有利也有弊。其优势在于氧气的丰富性和相对较低的成本，而挑战则包括需要仔细控制以防止意外反应并可能增加安全风险。

文档表明，在不同卤化剂类型的作用下，烷烃的卤代异构化过程会导致不同的产物分布。氯化过程倾向于产生烯烃，而溴化过程有利于形成溴化碳。这种产品分布的不同归因于烷基卤化物生成机制的差异以及随后形成的烯烃与溴化碳之间的反应路径。脱卤化步骤在此过程中起着关键作用，烯烃形成倾向受到诸如烷基卤化物的稳定性以及脱卤化与进一步卤化路径之间动力学的影响。

在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，催化剂对丙烯或烷烃的氧化表现出低活性，暗示卤化碳是观察到的碳氧化物的主要来源。这表明在氧化异构化过程中形成碳氧化物是一个自然副产品，可能需要进一步优化以减少这些排放或有效捕获和利用它们。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and the need for efficient catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially lower energy pathway for propylene production, reducing the dependency on fossil fuels, and potentially minimizing emissions. However, the selection of oxidant is crucial as it affects the energy efficiency and the production cost. Oxygen presents specific challenges due to its reactivity and the need for high pressures to ensure adequate reaction rates. The use of oxygen in ODHP can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts, which complicates the separation process and adds to the operational complexity.

2. The main reasons for the difference in product distribution between ethane oxychlorination and propane oxybromination lie in the distinct pathways of alkane activation and subsequent transformation. In ethane oxychlorination, alkane activation primarily occurs on the catalyst surface, leading to olefin formation through dehydrochlorination. In contrast, propane oxybromination involves alkyl bromide formation, which can undergo dehydrobromination or further bromination in the gas phase. The role of the hydrogen halide influences the selectivity as HCl favors olefin formation, while HBr promotes the formation of bromocarbons, particularly at low conversion levels.

3. The catalyst design criteria for methane oxybromination can be applied to ethane and propane oxybromination, emphasizing the importance of catalyst stability, activity, and selectivity under oxyhalogenation conditions. The choice of catalyst, such as europium oxychloride and europium oxybromide, influences the product distribution, with europium oxychloride showing superior stability and activity in ethane oxychlorination, while europium oxybromide excels in methane oxybromination.

4. The higher decomposition temperatures of alkyl chlorides compared to their brominated analogues are due to the stronger C-Cl bonds. This difference influences the differences in coke formation between oxychlorination and oxybromination reactions. In oxychlorination, the formation of coke is less prevalent because alkyl chlorides decompose at higher temperatures, leaving more opportunity for olefin formation. In oxybromination, the decomposition of alkyl bromides occurs at lower temperatures, leading to more coke formation, which can affect the catalyst's lifetime and performance.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境问题以及高效催化剂的需求。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供潜在的较低能效途径来解决这些挑战，降低对化石燃料的依赖，并可能减少排放。然而，氧化剂的选择至关重要，因为它影响能源效率和生产成本。氧气提出了特定的挑战，由于其反应性和需要高压以确保足够反应速率，导致操作复杂性增加。使用氧气在ODHP中可能导致形成副产品的复杂性，这增加了分离过程的难度和运营复杂性。

2. 乙烷氧氯化与丙烷氧溴化之间产品分布差异的主要原因在于烷烃激活和后续转换的不同时路径。在乙烷氧氯化中，烷烃激活主要发生在催化剂表面，导致通过脱氯化形成烯烃。相比之下，在丙烷氧溴化中，首先形成烷基溴化物，随后在气相中可以进行脱溴化或进一步溴化。氢卤酸的作用决定了选择性，HCl倾向于促进烯烃形成，而HBr倾向于促进溴化碳的形成，尤其是在低转化率水平下。

3. 甲烷氧溴化催化剂设计准则可应用于乙烷和丙烷氧溴化，强调在氧卤化条件下催化剂稳定性的关键作用、活性和选择性。例如，选择催化剂如氧化铕和氧化铕，它们影响产物分布，氧化铕在乙烷氧氯化中表现出优越的稳定性和活性，而氧化铕在甲烷氧溴化中表现出优异性能。

4. 烷基氯化物比其溴化同系物更高的分解温度归因于更强的C-Cl键。这种差异影响了氧氯化和氧溴化反应中焦炭形成之间的差异。在氧氯化中，由于烷基氯化物在较高温度下分解，因此有更多机会形成烯烃，从而形成较少的焦炭。在氧溴化中，烷基溴化物在较低温度下分解，导致更多的焦炭形成，这可能影响催化剂的寿命和性能。
