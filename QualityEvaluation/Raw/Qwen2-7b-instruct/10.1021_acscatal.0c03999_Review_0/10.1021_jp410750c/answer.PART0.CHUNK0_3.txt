[1] "The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand; hence, producers are always interested in developing on-demand technologies that produce propylene specifically."
[2] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications."
[3] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[4] "To suppress the complete oxidation of alkane to COx to ensure a reasonable selectivity while maintaining good conversion of the ODH reactions, application of catalysts has been investigated, and many catalytic systems were found to be active for the process."
[5] "Another approach of reducing the overoxdiation of alkane and olefins in the ODH reactions is the use of an additive or a milder oxidant. Species such as halogens, (11) sulfur-containing compounds, (12-14) N2O, (15) and CO2 (16) have been tested respectively."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the inability of cracking processes to meet the growing demand for propylene, leading to the interest in developing on-demand technologies specifically for propylene production. Dehydrogenation reactions also face limitations that restrict their widespread use.

2. Simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from multiple drawbacks that limit their applications, including thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature requiring high energy input, and the formation of coke leading to catalytic deactivation.

3. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) based on oxygen faces challenges such as overoxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, and the risk of reaction runaway. To mitigate these issues, catalysts are often applied, finding many catalytic systems effective for the process.

4. To reduce overoxidation of alkane and olefins in ODH reactions, additives or milder oxidants like halogens, sulfur-containing compounds, N2O, and CO2 are tested. These alternatives aim to suppress complete oxidation while maintaining reasonable selectivity and conversion.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：裂解过程无法跟上丙烯需求的增长，因此生产商总是对开发专门用于丙烯生产的按需技术感兴趣。简单的脱氢反应也面临着限制其广泛应用的多个问题，包括热力学约束下的选择性和转化率、需要高能量输入的吸热性质，以及导致催化剂失活的焦炭形成。

2. 简单的脱氢反应面临多个限制，限制了它们的广泛使用，包括选择性和转化率的热力学约束、需要高能量输入的吸热性质，以及导致催化剂失活的焦炭形成。

3. 基于氧气的氧化脱氢（ODH）面临过氧化问题，导致丙烯和CO、CO2的氧化，以及反应失控的风险。为了抑制烷烃和烯烃的完全氧化，同时保持合理的选择性和转化率，通常会应用催化剂，并发现许多催化系统对此过程有效。

4. 为减少烷烃和烯烃在ODH反应中的过氧化，卤素、含硫化合物、N2O和CO2等添加剂或较温和的氧化剂被测试。这些替代方案旨在抑制完全氧化，同时维持合理的选择性和转化率。
