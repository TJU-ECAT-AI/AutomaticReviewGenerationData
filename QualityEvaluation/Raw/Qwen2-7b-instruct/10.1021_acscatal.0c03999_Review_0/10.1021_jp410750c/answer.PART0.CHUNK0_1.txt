[1] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[2] "Another approach of reducing the overoxdiation of alkane and olefins in the ODH reactions is the use of an additive or a milder oxidant. Species such as halogens, (11) sulfur-containing compounds, (12-14) N2O, (15) and CO2 (16) have been tested respectively."
[3] "The presence of H2S in the feed mixture also exerts a promoting effect on the conversion of C3H8 after the initial stage of oxidation."
[4] "Doubling the O2 content in the feed further increased the propane conversion up to 72% at 1023 K at the expense of lower olefin selectivity, possibly because of the overoxidation of the olefin products."
[5] "When H2S was added to the feed, remarkable enhancement on propane conversion and product selectivity favoring olefins was observed."
[6] "In the meantime, the overall conversion of propane was boosted from 19% to 50%."
[7] "With the feed composed of 4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S, the maximum propylene selectivity achieved was 51% with the propane conversion of 50% at 923 K."
[8] "Increasing the temperature to 1023 K slightly reduced the propylene selectivity to 49% but the propane conversion was enhanced to 68%."
[9] "It was revealed according to the CBS-QB3 calculations that S2 was indeed the oxidant responsible for the propane oxidation when H2S was present in the feed, and it was formed from the rapid partial oxidation of H2S by O2 at around 1000 K."
[10] "It therefore could serve as an attractive alternative to industrial ODH reaction plants as much less effort was required in terms of reactor designs and operation costs."

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges including over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, and the risk of reaction runaway when using oxygen-based oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). This can be mitigated by using additives or milder oxidants like sulfur-containing compounds, N2O, and CO2.
2. When H2S is added to the feed gas in ODH reactions, it enhances propane conversion and selectively favors olefin production over other products.
3. The introduction of H2S leads to improved conversion of propane and increased selectivity towards olefin products, making the process more efficient.
4. Increasing the oxygen content in the feed gas leads to higher propane conversion but may reduce olefin selectivity due to potential overoxidation.
5. The addition of H2S to the feed mixture significantly boosts propane conversion while enhancing the selectivity towards olefin products.
6. The conversion of propane is notably increased from 19% to 50% when H2S is included in the feed.
7. With a feed ratio of 4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S, the maximum propylene selectivity reaches 51% with a 50% propane conversion at 923 K.
8. Raising the temperature to 1023 K slightly decreases the propylene selectivity to 49% but improves the propane conversion to 68%.
9. The calculations indicate that sulfur dioxide (S2) formed from the rapid partial oxidation of H2S by oxygen plays a key role in propane oxidation, enhancing the efficiency of the process.
10. The use of this ODH design without the need for catalysts can serve as an attractive alternative to existing industrial ODH plants, offering benefits in reactor design and operational costs.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临的问题包括基于氧气的氧化脱氢（ODH）过程中烯烃过度氧化为CO和CO2，以及反应失控的风险。这可以通过使用卤素、硫化合物、N2O和CO2等添加剂或较温和的氧化剂来缓解。
2. 在ODH反应中加入H2S到原料气中，可以显著提高丙烷转化率并选择性地促进烯烃的生成。
3. 添加H2S到原料混合物中不仅提高了丙烷转化率，而且增强了烯烃产品的选择性，使过程更有效。
4. 增加氧气含量在原料气体中导致更高的丙烷转化率，但可能因潜在的过氧化而降低烯烃选择性。
5. 将H2S添加到原料混合物中显著提升了丙烷转化率，并增强了烯烃产品选择性。
6. 丙烷转化率从19%提升到50%，这是在引入H2S时观察到的。
7. 使用4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S的原料配比，在923 K时，最大丙烯选择性达到51%，同时有50%的丙烷转化率。
8. 将温度提高到1023 K稍微降低了丙烯选择性至49%，但提高了68%的丙烷转化率。
9. 计算表明，硫化氢（H2S）快速部分氧化后形成的二氧化硫（S2）在丙烷氧化中起关键作用，提高了过程效率。
