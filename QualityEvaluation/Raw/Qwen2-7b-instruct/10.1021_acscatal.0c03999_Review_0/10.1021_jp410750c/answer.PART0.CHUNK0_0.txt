[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications."
[2] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[3] "When H2S was added to the feed, remarkable enhancement on propane conversion and product selectivity favoring olefins was observed."
[4] "With an oxygen-rich feed (4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S), 70% propane conversion, and 50% propylene selectivity could be achieved at 1023 K, a level of performance comparable to that for the ODH reaction employing reducible solid oxide catalysts."
[5] "Theoretical calculations utilizing CBS-QB3 method were also conducted to explore the causes of the enhanced propylene yield and selectivity of the H2S-assisted ODH reaction."

The main challenges in current propylene production methods include the limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, such as overoxidation to CO and CO2, and the risk of reaction runaway. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more efficient pathway to produce olefins, especially propylene. The introduction of H2S in the feed mixture enhances the propane conversion and selects for propylene production over other products, offering a competitive alternative to industrial ODH reactions without the need for catalysts, thus reducing the complexity and cost of reactor designs and operations.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括简单脱氢反应的局限性，如过氧化生成CO和CO2以及反应失控的风险。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，提供了一条更高效的制备烯烃尤其是丙烯的途径。在混合物中加入H2S显著提高了丙烷转化率，并优先选择生成丙烯，这为工业ODH反应提供了竞争性的替代方案，无需催化剂，从而降低了反应器设计和操作的复杂性和成本。
