[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane was investigated at temperatures between 923 and 1023 K using either O2 or O2/H2S mixture as oxidant. GC analysis of the product mixtures showed that ethylene was the major olefin product in the conventional ODH reaction whereas propylene became dominant when H2S was included in the feed gas."
[2] "With an oxygen-rich feed (4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S), 70% propane conversion, and 50% propylene selectivity could be achieved at 1023 K, a level of performance comparable to that for the ODH reaction employing reducible solid oxide catalysts."
[3] "The presence of H2S in the feed gas reversed the trend, and propylene was formed predominantly. With the feed composed of 4:2:2 C3H8:O2:H2S, the maximum propylene selectivity achieved was 51% with the propane conversion of 50% at 923 K."
[4] "It was revealed according to the CBS-QB3 calculations that S2 was indeed the oxidant responsible for the propane oxidation when H2S was present in the feed, and it was formed from the rapid partial oxidation of H2S by O2 at around 1000 K."
[5] "The data presented in this work showed clearly that the current reaction design (i.e., gas-phase C3H8/O2/H2S) without including any solid oxide ODH catalyst would already be able to afford the propane conversion and propylene selectivity comparative to those when vanadia or alumina was employed, although a higher operation temperature (greater by 150200 K approximately) was required."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include possible side reactions, thermodynamic constraints on selectivity and conversion, the endothermic nature of the process requiring high energy input, and coke formation leading to catalytic deactivation. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane addresses these issues by initiating the reaction via an oxidant rather than high temperature alone. However, the ODH based on oxygen faces challenges such as over-oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2 and the risk of reaction runaway. To overcome these, catalysts and mild oxidants are explored.

2. In the context of oxidant selection, oxygen is commonly used due to its low cost, low environmental impact, and ability to form H2O, which is highly exothermic and compensates for the energy cost of dehydrogenation. The use of sulfur-containing compounds, such as H2S, enhances the selectivity for propylene by forming an intermediate (S2) that participates in the hydrogen abstraction of propane, producing olefin products and recycling H2S.

3. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODH reactions are over-oxidation of olefins, potential reaction runaway, and the need for high energy input due to the endothermic nature of the process. H2S addition to the feed gas reverses the preference for ethylene, promoting the formation of propylene. The enhanced selectivity towards propylene is attributed to the formation of unstable sulfur-containing hydrocarbon species, which makes the reaction route to propylene more thermodynamically favored.

4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using a gas-phase mixture of propane, oxygen, and H2S achieves comparable propane conversion and propylene selectivity to industrially used solid oxide catalysts, albeit at a higher operating temperature. This makes the current reaction design an attractive alternative to traditional ODH processes, requiring less effort in terms of reactor design and operation costs.

5. The theoretical model developed based on the CBS-QB3 methodology confirms that the presence of H2S leads to the formation of S2, the oxidant responsible for propane oxidation, through the rapid partial oxidation of H2S by O2. The enhanced selectivity towards propylene in the presence of H2S results from the formation of relatively unstable sulfur-containing hydrocarbon species, which makes the reaction pathway to propylene more accessible and favored over other products.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括可能的副反应、选择性和转化率的热力学限制、过程的吸热性质需要高能量输入，以及焦炭形成导致催化剂失活。氧化脱氢化（ODH）丙烷通过仅通过氧化剂而不是高温来启动反应，解决了这些问题。然而，基于氧气的ODH存在过氧化烯烃为CO和CO2的风险以及反应失控的风险。通过探索催化剂和温和的氧化剂来克服这些挑战。

2. 在氧化剂选择的背景下，由于其低成本、低环境影响和能够形成高放热的水，氧气通常被使用。硫化物化合物，如H2S，通过形成中间体（S2），参与丙烷的氢提取并产生烯烃产物，循环回收H2S，增强丙烯的选择性。H2S的添加逆转了对乙烯的偏好，促进了丙烯的形成。丙烯选择性的增强归因于形成相对不稳定的硫含氢碳物种，这使得向丙烯的反应路径更加热力学有利。

3. 使用氧气在ODH反应中面临的主要挑战是烯烃的过氧化、潜在的反应失控以及由于过程的吸热性质而需要高能量输入。当添加H2S到燃料气体时，偏好从乙烷转变为丙烯，促进丙烯的形成。增强的丙烯选择性归因于形成相对不稳定的硫含氢碳物种，这使得向丙烯的反应路径更加可访问和有利，而不是其他产品。

4. 使用丙烷、氧气和H2S的气相混合物进行氧化脱氢化达到与工业上使用的固体氧化物催化剂相当的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性，尽管需要更高的操作温度。这使得当前的反应设计成为传统ODH过程的有吸引力的替代方案，需要更少的努力在反应器设计和运行成本方面。

5. 根据基于CBS-QB3方法开发的理论模型证实，H2S的存在导致形成S2，它是通过快速部分氧化H2S和O2形成的，这是丙烷氧化的氧化剂。在H2S存在的条件下，通过形成相对不稳定的硫含氢碳物种，增强了丙烯的选择性，这使得向丙烯的反应路径更加可访问和有利。
