[1] "Olefins can also be produced from dehydrogenation reactions of alkane feedstocks; however, simple dehydrogenation reactions suffer from numerous limitations that restrict their extensive applications."
[2] "Despite the desirable exothermic nature and the limited coke formation, ODH based on oxygen is confronted with the challenge of over oxidation of olefins to CO and CO2, as well as the possibility of reaction runaway."
[3] "The growth in supply of propylene from cracking processes is, however, unable to keep up with its continually growing demand; hence, producers are always interested in developing on-demand technologies that produce propylene specifically."
[4] "One modification that may overcome many of these problems is oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), in which an oxidant is added to the reaction feed of a thermal dehydrogenation unit, thereby initiating the reaction via the oxidant rather than high temperature alone."
[5] "Another approach of reducing the overoxdiation of alkane and olefins in the ODH reactions is the use of an additive or a milder oxidant."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the limitations of simple dehydrogenation reactions, such as the inability to produce propylene efficiently and the risk of overoxidation leading to CO and CO2 formation. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by initiating the reaction with an oxidant, which helps reduce overoxidation and enables the production of propylene specifically. However, ODHP faces its own set of challenges, including the need for a suitable oxidant that can balance efficiency and selectivity. Alternatives like sulfur-containing compounds or other mild oxidants are explored to mitigate these challenges and improve the performance of ODHP.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括简单脱氢反应的局限性，如无法高效地生产丙烯以及过氧化导致CO和CO2形成的风险。通过使用氧化剂启动氧化脱氢反应（ODHP），可以解决这些问题并实现丙烯的特定生产。然而，ODHP面临自己的挑战，包括需要平衡效率和选择性的适当氧化剂。探索硫化合物或其他温和氧化剂作为替代品，以改善ODHP的性能。
