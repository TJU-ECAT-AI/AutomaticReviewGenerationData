[1] "The natural gas industry has relied on gas absorption for purification of raw natural gas for nearly 100 years, and this separation technique dominates most sour gas separations around the globe even today."
[2] "Alkanolamines, all other solvents usually absorb the gas physically, and their very high capacities make them of interest if a feed with high acid gas partial pressure is available."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), include the high cost and energy requirement for oxidant selection. Oxygen is commonly used due to its availability and low cost, but it presents challenges such as the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, researchers are exploring alternative oxidants with lower reactivity and fewer side reactions. This can potentially reduce the energy duty for the process, making propylene production more efficient and cost-effective.

Propylene production using ODHP offers several advantages over traditional methods, including lower capital and operating costs, improved selectivity, and the potential for higher yields. However, the process is highly sensitive to the choice of oxidant. The use of alternative oxidants, such as nitrogen oxides or halogenated compounds, can mitigate the formation of byproducts and improve the overall efficiency of the process. These alternatives, while presenting their own set of challenges in terms of availability, toxicity, and cost, offer promising avenues for optimizing propylene production through oxidative dehydrogenation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战，特别是氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP），包括选择氧化剂的高成本和能量需求。由于氧气的可用性和低成本，通常使用氧气，但它提出了挑战，如形成副产品如一氧化碳和二氧化碳，可能导致催化剂失活。通过探索具有较低反应性和更少副反应的替代氧化剂来解决这些问题，可以潜在地降低过程的能量需求，使丙烯生产更加高效和经济。

通过氧化脱氢生产丙烯提供了几个优势，与传统方法相比，包括更低的资本和运营成本、更高的选择性和可能的更高产率。然而，该过程对所选氧化剂的选择极为敏感。使用替代氧化剂，如氮氧化物或卤化物，可以减少副产品的形成并提高过程的整体效率。这些替代品在可用性、毒性及成本方面提出了自己的挑战，但为优化氧化脱氢生产丙烯提供了有前景的途径。
