Usually, when metals are employed for H2S removal, they are used as sacrificial sorbents since, during a regeneration process, metals will have a strong tendency to sinter and aggregate, resulting in a complete loss of surface area and active sites. By isolating and stabilizing small metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of the sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering (see Figure 5).

Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidationreduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between. A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorptionregeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the ratio of chemisorbed H2S to Ni being 0.07.

It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide.

3.3 MetalOrganic Frameworks
MOFs are porous structures resulting from coordination of metal ions or clusters to organic ligands. (172) Bare metals exist at most as nanoparticles formed out of clusters of several thousands of atoms and suffer from activity loss by way of sintering during high-temperature regeneration. MOFs provide a scheme for isolating the metal atoms or the metal oxide clusters by being chemically coordinated within a porous framework.

3.4 Zeolites
For several decades, zeolites have been used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry for cracking, isomerization, and alkylation applications. These materials are also widely used for water purification and softening in the detergent industry. Structurally, zeolites are crystalline porous aluminosilicates consisting of a three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra.

3.4.1 All-Silica Zeolites
All-silica zeolites have a very low polarity due to negligible amounts of polar cations and silanol defects, imparting a highly hydrophobic character to this class of zeolites. (206)

3.4.2 Aluminosilicate Zeolites
Aluminosilicate zeolites are crystalline microporous frameworks, based on a three-dimensional network of silica and alumina, that can accommodate a variety of cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc.

3.5 Carbon-Based Adsorbents
3.5.1 Activated Carbons
Activated carbon (AC) with surface areas easily in excess of 1000 m2/g due to a high degree of microporosity is a well-known material for adsorption and catalysis.

3.5.2 Structured Carbons
Structured nanoporous carbon materials may be broadly classified into two main kinds: graphene-based materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs).

3.6 Composite Materials
3.6.1 Metal Oxides/Mesoporous Silica
While metal oxide sorbents show high affinity for H2S, they suffer from limitations such as loss in surface area and porosity, and this subsequently results in degraded performance during cyclic sulfidation and regeneration.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and the complexity of the processes involved. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods such as the dehydrogenation of ethylene or the thermal cracking of naphtha. ODHP utilizes a catalytic process to convert propane into propylene, which can lead to lower energy requirements compared to other routes.

One of the key advantages of ODHP is its potential to reduce energy consumption. Traditional methods often require high temperatures and pressures, which can lead to significant energy costs. ODHP, however, operates at lower temperatures and pressures, making it more energy-efficient. This efficiency can be further enhanced by the use of advanced catalysts that optimize the reaction conditions.

Another advantage of ODHP is its environmental benefits. Traditional methods can generate substantial amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. By contrast, ODHP produces propylene with fewer emissions, contributing to a cleaner manufacturing process. This aligns with global efforts to reduce environmental impact and meet sustainability targets.

Despite these advantages, ODHP faces challenges related to oxidant selection. Oxygen is commonly used as the oxidant in ODHP, but its supply can be costly and challenging to handle, especially in industrial settings. Alternative oxidants, such as air or certain chemical compounds, might offer a more economical solution but require careful consideration of safety and efficiency.

Specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include the need for robust catalysts capable of operating under the harsh conditions of the reaction, managing the risk of explosive mixtures due to the flammability of oxygen, and optimizing the process parameters to ensure high conversion rates and selectivity to propylene. These challenges necessitate ongoing research and development to improve the technology and make it more viable for widespread industrial application.

In summary, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane presents a promising route for propylene production, offering potential energy savings, reduced environmental impact, and more efficient catalyst usage. However, the technology still faces challenges related to oxidant selection, process optimization, and catalyst development that require further investigation and innovation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、环境问题以及过程的复杂性。氧化脱氢法（ODHP）通过提供一个可能更节能、环境友好的替代途径来解决这些问题，与传统方法如乙烷脱氢或石脑油热裂解相比，ODHP利用催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯，这可能需要较低的能耗。

ODHP的一个关键优势是其节能潜力。传统方法通常需要高温和高压，这会导致显著的能源成本。相比之下，ODHP在较低温度和压力下运行，使其更加节能。通过优化反应条件，先进的催化剂可以进一步提高效率。

另一个ODHP的优势是其环境益处。传统方法会产生大量温室气体和其他污染物。相比之下，ODHP以较少的排放生产丙烯，符合减少环境影响和满足可持续发展目标的努力。

尽管这些优势，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面面临挑战。氧气通常用作ODHP的氧化剂，但其供应可能成本高昂且难以处理，尤其是在工业环境中。替代氧化剂，如空气或某些化学化合物，可能提供更经济的解决方案，但需要仔细考虑安全性和效率。

使用氧气在ODHP中遇到的具体挑战包括需要能够适应反应苛刻条件的耐用催化剂、管理由于氧气可燃性导致的爆炸混合物的风险，以及优化工艺参数以确保高转化率和丙烯选择性。这些挑战需要持续的研究和发展，以改进技术并使其更适合广泛工业应用。

总之，氧化脱氢法为丙烯生产提供了一个有前景的途径，提供了潜在的能源节省、减少环境影响和更高效的催化剂使用的可能性。然而，该技术仍然面临与氧化剂选择、过程优化和催化剂开发相关的挑战，需要进一步的研究和创新。
