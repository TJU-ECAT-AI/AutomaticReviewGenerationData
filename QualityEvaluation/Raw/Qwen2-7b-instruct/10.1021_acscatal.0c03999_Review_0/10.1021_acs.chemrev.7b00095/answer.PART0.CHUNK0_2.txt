[1] "The natural gas industry has relied on gas absorption for purification of raw natural gas for nearly 100 years, and this separation technique dominates most sour gas separations around the globe even today."
[2] "For chemisorption, solubility of the gas in the liquid increases sharply at very low pressures and starts to plateau at higher pressures; the plateau is indicative of the stoichiometric capacity for the chemical reaction."
[3] "Clearly, the extent of H2S and CO2 removal required can be very different too. For example, nearly complete removal of H2S without any major removal of CO2 is desired for a feed gas containing high H2S concentration but CO2 concentration being already at 2%."
[4] "Bottoms for the first time, in 1930, developed an absorption process for acid gases using alkanolamine solutions."

1. The natural gas industry has been using gas absorption for purification purposes for almost 100 years, and it remains the primary technique for separating sour gases worldwide.
2. Chemisorption exhibits a rapid increase in gas solubility within a liquid at low pressures, followed by a plateau at higher pressures, which signifies the stoichiometric capacity for the chemical reaction.
3. The amount of H2S and CO2 removal needed can vary significantly depending on the specific gas feedstock. For instance, complete H2S removal with minimal CO2 removal is often desired for high H2S concentration feeds with a CO2 concentration already at 2%.
4. Bottoms pioneered the use of alkanolamine solutions for acid gas absorption in 1930.

1. 天然气行业在近一个世纪以来一直依赖气体吸收技术进行天然气净化，这一分离技术至今在全球的酸性气体分离中占据主导地位。
2. 化学吸附在低压时气体在液体中的溶解度会迅速增加，并在较高压力时达到平台期，这一平台期表示化学反应的定比容量。
3. H2S和CO2的去除量需求可能因不同的进料气体而有很大差异。例如，在高H2S浓度且CO2浓度已达到2%的进料气中，通常需要实现完全的H2S去除而尽量减少CO2的去除。
4. 底部公司首次在1930年开发了使用醇胺溶液进行酸性气体吸收的过程。
