[1] "The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and the environmental impact of traditional methods, which often involve the use of fossil fuels. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a more sustainable alternative that can potentially reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions."
[2] "ODHP addresses these issues by providing a cleaner and more efficient route for propylene production, eliminating the need for large-scale energy-intensive processes."
[3] "However, the use of oxygen as the oxidant presents its own set of challenges. Oxygen can be highly reactive, which requires careful control to avoid unwanted reactions that could lead to the formation of harmful byproducts."
[4] "Specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include managing the oxygen concentration, controlling the reaction rate, and ensuring the safety of the process. These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that oxygen can react rapidly with other components in the reaction mixture, leading to potential risks and inefficiencies."
[5] "To overcome these challenges, researchers are exploring various strategies, such as developing novel catalysts, optimizing process conditions, and implementing advanced control systems to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the ODHP process. Additionally, the use of alternative oxidants, such as air or other oxygen-rich gases, is being investigated to reduce the risk and complexity associated with pure oxygen usage."
