[1] "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a colorless gas with a characteristic odor of rotten eggs."
[2] "It is highly toxic, corrosive, and flammable in nature."
[3] "Since H2S is heavier than air, it has a tendency to settle in low-lying and poorly ventilated areas."
[4] "Handling of H2S requires stringent safety regulations such as trained personnel, complete set of personal protective equipment including a gas mask, strategically located sensors, and emergency evacuation plans."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include handling highly toxic, corrosive, and flammable hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. H2S is heavier than air, which makes it prone to settling in low areas and poorly ventilated places. Safety measures such as trained personnel, proper personal protective equipment, sensors, and evacuation plans are necessary.
