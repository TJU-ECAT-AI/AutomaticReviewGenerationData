Usually, when metals are employed for H2S removal, they are used as sacrificial sorbents since, during a regeneration process, metals will have a strong tendency to sinter and aggregate, resulting in a complete loss of surface area and active sites. By isolating and stabilizing small metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of the sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering (see Figure 5).

Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidationreduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between. A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorptionregeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16, with the ratio of chemisorbed H2S to Ni being 0.07.

It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide.

3.3 MetalOrganic Frameworks
MOFs are porous structures resulting from coordination of metal ions or clusters to organic ligands. (172) Bare metals exist at most as nanoparticles formed out of clusters of several thousands of atoms and suffer from activity loss by way of sintering during high-temperature regeneration. MOFs provide a scheme for isolating the metal atoms or the metal oxide clusters by being chemically coordinated within a porous framework.

3.4 Zeolites
For several decades, zeolites have been used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry for cracking, isomerization, and alkylation applications. These materials are also widely used for water purification and softening in the detergent industry. Structurally, zeolites are crystalline porous aluminosilicates consisting of a three-dimensional framework of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra.

3.4.1 All-Silica Zeolites
All-silica zeolites have a very low polarity due to negligible amounts of polar cations and silanol defects, imparting a highly hydrophobic character to this class of zeolites. (206)

3.4.2 Aluminosilicate Zeolites
Aluminosilicate zeolites are crystalline microporous frameworks, based on a three-dimensional network of silica and alumina, that can accommodate a variety of cations such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc.

3.5 Carbon-Based Adsorbents
3.5.1 Activated Carbons
Activated carbon (AC) with surface areas easily in excess of 1000 m2/g due to a high degree of microporosity is a well-known material for adsorption and catalysis.

3.5.2 Structured Carbons
Structured nanoporous carbon materials may be broadly classified into two main kinds: graphene-based materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs).

3.6 Composite Materials
3.6.1 Metal Oxides/Mesoporous Silica
While metal oxide sorbents show high affinity for H2S, they suffer from limitations such as loss in surface area and porosity, and this subsequently results in degraded performance during cyclic sulfidation and regeneration.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and the complexity of the processes involved. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods such as the dehydrogenation of ethylene or the thermal cracking of naphtha. ODHP utilizes a catalytic process to convert propane into propylene, which can lead to lower energy requirements compared to other routes.

One of the key advantages of ODHP is its potential to reduce energy consumption. Traditional methods often require high temperatures and pressures, which can lead to significant energy costs. ODHP, however, operates at lower temperatures and pressures, making it more energy-efficient. This efficiency can be further enhanced by the use of advanced catalysts that optimize the reaction conditions.

Another advantage of ODHP is its environmental benefits. Traditional methods can generate substantial amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. By contrast, ODHP produces propylene with fewer emissions, contributing to a cleaner manufacturing process. This aligns with global efforts to reduce environmental impact and meet sustainability targets.

Despite these advantages, ODHP faces challenges related to oxidant selection. Oxygen is commonly used as the oxidant in ODHP, but its supply can be costly and challenging to handle, especially in industrial settings. Alternative oxidants, such as air or certain chemical compounds, might offer a more economical solution but require careful consideration of safety and efficiency.

Specific challenges associated with using oxygen in ODHP include the need for robust catalysts capable of operating under the harsh conditions of the reaction, managing the risk of explosive mixtures due to the flammability of oxygen, and optimizing the process parameters to ensure high conversion rates and selectivity to propylene. These challenges necessitate ongoing research and development to improve the technology and make it more viable for widespread industrial application.

In summary, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane presents a promising route for propylene production, offering potential energy savings, reduced environmental impact, and more efficient catalyst usage. However, the technology still faces challenges related to oxidant selection, process optimization, and catalyst development that require further investigation and innovation.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能消耗、环境问题以及过程的复杂性。氧化脱氢法（ODHP）通过提供一个可能更节能、环境友好的替代途径来解决这些问题，与传统方法如乙烷脱氢或石脑油热裂解相比，ODHP利用催化剂将丙烷转化为丙烯，这可能需要较低的能耗。

ODHP的一个关键优势是其节能潜力。传统方法通常需要高温和高压，这会导致显著的能源成本。相比之下，ODHP在较低温度和压力下运行，使其更加节能。通过优化反应条件，先进的催化剂可以进一步提高效率。

另一个ODHP的优势是其环境益处。传统方法会产生大量温室气体和其他污染物。相比之下，ODHP以较少的排放生产丙烯，符合减少环境影响和满足可持续发展目标的努力。

尽管这些优势，ODHP在氧化剂选择方面面临挑战。氧气通常用作ODHP的氧化剂，但其供应可能成本高昂且难以处理，尤其是在工业环境中。替代氧化剂，如空气或某些化学化合物，可能提供更经济的解决方案，但需要仔细考虑安全性和效率。

使用氧气在ODHP中遇到的具体挑战包括需要能够适应反应苛刻条件的耐用催化剂、管理由于氧气可燃性导致的爆炸混合物的风险，以及优化工艺参数以确保高转化率和丙烯选择性。这些挑战需要持续的研究和发展，以改进技术并使其更适合广泛工业应用。

总之，氧化脱氢法为丙烯生产提供了一个有前景的途径，提供了潜在的能源节省、减少环境影响和更高效的催化剂使用的可能性。然而，该技术仍然面临与氧化剂选择、过程优化和催化剂开发相关的挑战，需要进一步的研究和创新。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve energy consumption, environmental impact, and the need for efficient catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient process with lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. One significant limitation is the choice of oxidant, with oxygen being the most common but presenting challenges related to safety and potential for explosive mixtures. Alternative oxidants, such as air or other inert gases, may offer safer options but could compromise the selectivity and efficiency of the process.

2. In the context of using oxygen as the oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the main challenges are safety considerations and potential for explosive mixtures. Oxygen is highly reactive and requires careful handling to prevent accidents. Alternative oxidants, such as air or other inert gases, may offer safer options but could compromise the selectivity and efficiency of the process. Additionally, the selection of the oxidant affects the energy requirements and the overall economics of the process. Air, for instance, contains nitrogen which may dilute the effectiveness of the oxidation reaction, necessitating adjustments in the process design and operation.

3. In the context of using oxygen as the oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for stringent safety protocols to manage its high reactivity and the risk of explosive mixtures. Oxygen's reactivity also impacts the energy requirements of the process, as it necessitates a high-energy input to initiate and sustain the oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the use of oxygen may limit the process's scalability and economic viability due to the increased costs associated with oxygen supply and handling. Alternative oxidants, such as air or inert gases, may offer a balance between safety, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness but may also introduce trade-offs in terms of selectivity and reaction kinetics.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, particularly in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), include the high cost and energy requirement for oxidant selection. Oxygen is commonly used due to its availability and low cost, but it presents challenges such as the formation of byproducts like carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which can lead to catalyst deactivation. To address these issues, researchers are exploring alternative oxidants with lower reactivity and fewer side reactions. This can potentially reduce the energy duty for the process, making propylene production more efficient and cost-effective.

Propylene production using ODHP offers several advantages over traditional methods, including lower capital and operating costs, improved selectivity, and the potential for higher yields. However, the process is highly sensitive to the choice of oxidant. The use of alternative oxidants, such as nitrogen oxides or halogenated compounds, can mitigate the formation of byproducts and improve the overall efficiency of the process. These alternatives, while presenting their own set of challenges in terms of availability, toxicity, and cost, offer promising avenues for optimizing propylene production through oxidative dehydrogenation.

[1] "In the past, when metals were utilized for H2S removal, they were employed as sacrificial sorbents since, during a regeneration process, metals will have a strong tendency to sinter and aggregate, resulting in a complete loss of surface area and active sites."
[2] "By isolating and stabilizing small metal particles in cubic structured mesoporous silica, Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of the sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering (see Figure 5)."
[3] "It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide."
[4] "Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between."
[5] "Due to the highly porous nature of most MOFs, their lower conductivity (0.3 W/m·K for MOF-5 at 300 K (175)) compared to that of crystalline materials in general can be a potential concern for strong hostguest interactions."
[6] "In the hydrated state, each metal is coordinated by one H2O molecule, but upon activation at 150 C under vacuum, H2O is removed, leaving the metal in square pyramidal geometry with an open metal site, resulting in SBET = 1193 and 379 m2/g, respectively."
[7] "However, the material cannot be fully regenerated at outgassing temperature of 150 C and a vacuum of 0.1 Pa, (194) but it could be nearly completely regenerated at 200 C. (195)"
[8] "The authors comment that, beyond this loading, the drop in interaction strength can be justified with typical weak physisorption with no specific interaction between the host/guest species."
[9] "The authors also carried out breakthrough measurements for a ternary mixture containing 5% H2S, 5% CO2, and 90% CH4 for six adsorption-desorption cycles with a combination of temperature and vacuum swing regeneration."
[10] "Future studies should account for factors such as moisture, regeneration for several cycles, and XRD measurements before and after each (or at least, after every few) regeneration."

In another study, physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration. (297) The adsorbent could maintain an outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv. The utility of these sorbents for natural gas sweetening at higher H2S concentrations needs to be investigated. In yet another study, linear PEI was dispersed inside the meso-channels of a SBA-15 framework, allowing interaction of amine groups in PEI with silanol groups on SBA-15. (298) The breakthrough and saturation capacities increased with inlet H2S concentrations of 2000, 4000, and 6000 ppmv in the ranges 0.68, 1.18, 1.48 and 1.50, 2.06, 2.38 mmol/g, respectively. The saturation value for amine-grafted sorbents at 1000 ppmv is 0.56 mmol/g. (292) So unlike TEA, PEI-modified supports show higher affinity for H2S, probably due to higher basicity of PEI, but possibly due to higher swelling of PEI compared to TEA. This is an open question that can be addressed perhaps by molecular simulations. The presence of moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence. However, moisture also resulted in a decrease in H2S desorption rates. The same authors also studied the effects of the operating temperature (2275 C), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV; 3371011 h1), amount of PEI loading, and different molecular sieve supports (MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-15). (299) The structure of the mesoporous molecular sieves influences the kinetic capacity of the supported PEI sorbents; large pore size and three-dimensional channel structure favor higher breakthrough capacity. A decrease in temperature favors both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while a decrease in GHSV enhances the breakthrough capacity. The amount of PEI loading has a strong synergetic influence on the sorption performance: 50 wt% PEI on SBA-15 gives the best breakthrough capacity, while 65 wt% PEI on SBA-15 shows the highest saturation capacity. The developed sorbents exhibit a breakthrough capacity as high as 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2. In addition, the developed sorbents can be regenerated easily at mild conditions (75100 C), with sorption capacity maintained over eight cycles.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental impacts, and the complexity of the processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and streamlined production pathway. Specifically, ODHP utilizes oxygen as the oxidant, which can significantly reduce the energy required for the dehydrogenation process compared to traditional methods that often rely on steam or other more energy-intensive oxidants. 

ODHP presents several advantages over traditional propylene production methods, including:
1. **Energy Efficiency**: Oxygen as an oxidant enables a more direct and efficient conversion of propane to propylene, minimizing the energy input required for the process.
2. **Environmental Impact**: By reducing the energy consumption and eliminating the need for steam, ODHP contributes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint compared to conventional methods.
3. **Process Simplicity**: ODHP typically involves fewer steps and simpler equipment compared to traditional processes, leading to reduced capital costs and easier maintenance.

However, ODHP also faces certain limitations and challenges:
1. **Oxidant Selection**: The choice of oxidant, particularly oxygen, introduces specific safety considerations and requires careful management of the combustion process to prevent accidents and optimize efficiency.
2. **Specific Challenges with Oxygen**: Using oxygen as an oxidant necessitates strict control over the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions and ensure a safe and efficient conversion. Oxygen's reactivity also means that the process must be carefully managed to avoid overheating or other adverse effects.
3. **Thermal Management**: Ensuring proper thermal management is crucial to maintain the reaction at optimal temperatures for propylene production while avoiding overheating or other thermal issues that could compromise product quality or process efficiency.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research and development in the field aim to refine ODHP processes, optimize catalysts, and improve process conditions to maximize efficiency and reliability, making it a promising avenue for future propylene production.
