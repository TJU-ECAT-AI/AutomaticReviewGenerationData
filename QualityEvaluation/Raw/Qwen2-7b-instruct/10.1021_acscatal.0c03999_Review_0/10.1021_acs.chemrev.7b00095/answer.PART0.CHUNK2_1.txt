The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental impacts from emissions, and the complexity of the processes involved. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient, cleaner process with lower environmental impact. It presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. The use of oxygen in ODHP introduces challenges due to its high reactivity, which can lead to unwanted side reactions and product degradation. To mitigate these issues, researchers focus on optimizing the reaction conditions and catalysts to ensure a high yield of propylene with minimal byproducts. Additionally, the development of mixed-matrix membranes composed of MOFs dispersed in polymeric materials is an area of future investigation aimed at improving the efficiency and selectivity of gas separation processes, which can contribute to the overall optimization of propylene production.
