In another study, physically loaded polyethylenimine (PEI) particles on mesoporous molecular sieves MCM-41 at 50 wt% loading were explored for low-temperature H2S adsorption at 90 C and 10 ppmv inlet concentration. (297) The adsorbent could maintain an outlet concentration of 0.04 ppmv. The utility of these sorbents for natural gas sweetening at higher H2S concentrations needs to be investigated. In yet another study, linear PEI was dispersed inside the meso-channels of a SBA-15 framework, allowing interaction of amine groups in PEI with silanol groups on SBA-15. (298) The breakthrough and saturation capacities increased with inlet H2S concentrations of 2000, 4000, and 6000 ppmv in the ranges 0.68, 1.18, 1.48 and 1.50, 2.06, 2.38 mmol/g, respectively. The saturation value for amine-grafted sorbents at 1000 ppmv is 0.56 mmol/g. (292) So unlike TEA, PEI-modified supports show higher affinity for H2S, probably due to higher basicity of PEI, but possibly due to higher swelling of PEI compared to TEA. This is an open question that can be addressed perhaps by molecular simulations. The presence of moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence. However, moisture also resulted in a decrease in H2S desorption rates. The same authors also studied the effects of the operating temperature (2275 C), gas hourly space velocity (GHSV; 3371011 h1), amount of PEI loading, and different molecular sieve supports (MCM-41, MCM-48, and SBA-15). (299) The structure of the mesoporous molecular sieves influences the kinetic capacity of the supported PEI sorbents; large pore size and three-dimensional channel structure favor higher breakthrough capacity. A decrease in temperature favors both breakthrough and saturation capacities, while a decrease in GHSV enhances the breakthrough capacity. The amount of PEI loading has a strong synergetic influence on the sorption performance: 50 wt% PEI on SBA-15 gives the best breakthrough capacity, while 65 wt% PEI on SBA-15 shows the highest saturation capacity. The developed sorbents exhibit a breakthrough capacity as high as 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22 C using 4000 ppm H2S, 20% H2 in bulk N2. In addition, the developed sorbents can be regenerated easily at mild conditions (75100 C), with sorption capacity maintained over eight cycles.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental impacts, and the complexity of the processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and streamlined production pathway. Specifically, ODHP utilizes oxygen as the oxidant, which can significantly reduce the energy required for the dehydrogenation process compared to traditional methods that often rely on steam or other more energy-intensive oxidants. 

ODHP presents several advantages over traditional propylene production methods, including:
1. **Energy Efficiency**: Oxygen as an oxidant enables a more direct and efficient conversion of propane to propylene, minimizing the energy input required for the process.
2. **Environmental Impact**: By reducing the energy consumption and eliminating the need for steam, ODHP contributes to lower greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint compared to conventional methods.
3. **Process Simplicity**: ODHP typically involves fewer steps and simpler equipment compared to traditional processes, leading to reduced capital costs and easier maintenance.

However, ODHP also faces certain limitations and challenges:
1. **Oxidant Selection**: The choice of oxidant, particularly oxygen, introduces specific safety considerations and requires careful management of the combustion process to prevent accidents and optimize efficiency.
2. **Specific Challenges with Oxygen**: Using oxygen as an oxidant necessitates strict control over the reaction conditions to prevent unwanted side reactions and ensure a safe and efficient conversion. Oxygen's reactivity also means that the process must be carefully managed to avoid overheating or other adverse effects.
3. **Thermal Management**: Ensuring proper thermal management is crucial to maintain the reaction at optimal temperatures for propylene production while avoiding overheating or other thermal issues that could compromise product quality or process efficiency.

Despite these challenges, ongoing research and development in the field aim to refine ODHP processes, optimize catalysts, and improve process conditions to maximize efficiency and reliability, making it a promising avenue for future propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境影响和过程复杂性。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更节能、环境友好且流程简化的生产途径来解决这些问题。特别是，ODHP使用氧气作为氧化剂，与传统方法通常依赖蒸汽或其他更耗能的氧化剂相比，可以显著降低脱氢过程所需的能量。

ODHP相对于传统丙烯生产方法的优势包括：
1. **能源效率**：使用氧气作为氧化剂能够更直接且高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，从而减少所需的能量输入。
2. **环境影响**：通过降低能耗并消除蒸汽等其他更高碳足迹的方法的需要，ODHP有助于减少温室气体排放和较小的碳足迹。
3. **流程简化**：ODHP通常涉及的步骤较少且设备较简单，导致资本成本降低和维护更容易。

然而，ODHP也面临着一些限制和挑战：
1. **氧化剂选择**：选择氧化剂，尤其是氧气，引入了特定的安全考虑，并要求对燃烧过程进行精细管理以防止事故并优化效率。
2. **氧气的具体挑战**：使用氧气作为氧化剂需要严格控制反应条件，以防止意外副反应并确保高效的丙烯转化。氧气的活性也意味着过程必须仔细管理，以避免过热或其他不利影响。
3. **热管理**：确保适当的热管理对于保持反应在最优温度下进行，同时避免过热或其他可能损害产品质量或过程效率的问题至关重要。

尽管存在这些挑战，持续的研究和发展旨在细化ODHP过程、优化催化剂并改进工艺条件，以最大化效率和可靠性，使其成为未来丙烯生产有前景的途径。
