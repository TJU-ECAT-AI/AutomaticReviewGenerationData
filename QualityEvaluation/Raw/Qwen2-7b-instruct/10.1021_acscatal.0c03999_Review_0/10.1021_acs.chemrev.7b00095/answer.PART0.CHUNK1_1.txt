<p>While metals are often used for H2S removal, they tend to sinter and aggregate during regeneration, losing surface area and active sites. To address this, Li et al. (2009) stabilized small metal particles in mesoporous silica, achieving a fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five cycles for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16.</p>
<p>The presence of polar impurities such as H2O can affect the adsorption performance and stability of adsorbents in desulfurization applications. This is an important consideration for the successful application of MOFs.</p>
<p>Hamon et al. (2011) conducted the first experimental study of H2S adsorption in MOFs, demonstrating that the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)) is capable of predicting the structural transformation during adsorption isotherm simulation.</p>
<p>Vaesen et al. (2012) explored the functionalization of MOFs for desulfurization applications by comparing amino-functionalized titanium terephthalate MIL-125(Ti)-NH2 versus its parent MIL-125(Ti) analogue, finding that the functionalized material had higher H2S adsorption selectivity.</p>
<p>Yang et al. (2012) studied H2S adsorption in MIL-68(Al) at room temperature using molecular simulations and experiments, finding that the material was fully regenerable for five consecutive cycles with a pure-component H2S capacity of 12 mmol/g at 30°C and 12 bar.</p>
<p>Cu-BTC (HKUST-1 or MOF-199) is a material that comprises of an intersecting three-dimensional system of large square-shaped pores and small tetrahedral pockets, with a reasonable degree of thermal stability up to 240°C. However, exposure to H2S results in a collapse of the MOF structure.</p>
<p>Eddaoudi et al. (2013) synthesized a series of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOF-n, n = 116) based on a skeleton of Zn-based MOF-5, varying the pore functionality and size without changing the original cubic topology. These MOFs were found to have lower heat of adsorption for H2S compared to Cu-BTC.</p>
<p>Allan et al. (2013) studied desulfurization using Ni-CPO-27 and Zn-CPO-27, where Ni/Zn cations are linked by 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid organic linkers. The material showed a high loading capacity at low pressures, but could not be fully regenerated at outgassing temperature.</p>
<p>SAPO-43 is a microporous sorbent with appropriate dimensions for sour gas sieving, but its low thermal stability up to about 300°C prevents its utilization for adsorptive separations.</p>
<p>Basel ZnO was found to have a high adsorption capacity for H2S, with utilization percentages of up to 93% upon doping with Cu.</p>
<p>Structured carbons, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have been investigated for their role in adsorbing H2S, with graphene showing strong adsorption energies due to defect sites.</p>
<p>Composite materials, such as metal oxides supported on mesoporous silica, have been developed to improve the performance of H2S adsorbents by providing narrow pore sizes and high surface areas, which tailor the adsorption properties.</p>

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve energy consumption, environmental impact, and the need for efficient catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more energy-efficient process with lower environmental impact compared to traditional methods. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly in the context of oxidant selection. One significant limitation is the choice of oxidant, with oxygen being the most common but presenting challenges related to safety and potential for explosive mixtures. Alternative oxidants, such as air or other inert gases, may offer safer options but could compromise the selectivity and efficiency of the process.

2. In the context of using oxygen as the oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the main challenges are safety considerations and potential for explosive mixtures. Oxygen is highly reactive and requires careful handling to prevent accidents. Alternative oxidants, such as air or other inert gases, may offer safer options but could compromise the selectivity and efficiency of the process. Additionally, the selection of the oxidant affects the energy requirements and the overall economics of the process. Air, for instance, contains nitrogen which may dilute the effectiveness of the oxidation reaction, necessitating adjustments in the process design and operation.

3. In the context of using oxygen as the oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for stringent safety protocols to manage its high reactivity and the risk of explosive mixtures. Oxygen's reactivity also impacts the energy requirements of the process, as it necessitates a high-energy input to initiate and sustain the oxidation reaction. Furthermore, the use of oxygen may limit the process's scalability and economic viability due to the increased costs associated with oxygen supply and handling. Alternative oxidants, such as air or inert gases, may offer a balance between safety, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness but may also introduce trade-offs in terms of selectivity and reaction kinetics.
