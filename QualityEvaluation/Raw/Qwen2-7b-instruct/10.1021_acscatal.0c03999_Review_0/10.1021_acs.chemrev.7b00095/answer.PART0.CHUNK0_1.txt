[1] "The natural gas industry has relied on gas absorption for purification of raw natural gas for nearly 100 years, and this separation technique dominates most sour gas separations around the globe even today."
[2] "A variety of different liquid solvents have been employed in a tray or a packed-bed configuration to selectively absorb H2S and CO2 from CH4 and light alkanes."
[3] "All other solvents usually absorb the gas physically, and their very high capacities make them of interest if a feed with high acid gas partial pressure is available."

1. The natural gas industry has been using gas absorption for nearly a century to purify raw natural gas, and this technique is widely used for separating sour gas worldwide.
2. A range of liquid solvents are used in trays or packed beds to selectively absorb H2S and CO2 from methane and lighter hydrocarbons.
3. Other solvents typically absorb gases physically, and their high capacities are advantageous when dealing with high-pressure feeds of acidic gases.
