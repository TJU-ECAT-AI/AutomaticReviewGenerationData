[1] "For several decades, zeolites have been used as catalysts in the petrochemical industry for cracking, isomerization, and alkylation applications."
[2] "This material demonstrated a high H2S capacity of 4 mmol/g at 25 C and 2 bar, suggesting that all-silica zeolites maybe promising materials for bulk H2S removal."
[3] "There is a considerable degree of overlap between the zeolites identified from the two screening studies in the literature for high H2S/CH4 selectivities."
[4] "The authors observed poor thermal desorption at 350 C, indicating no physisorption and the formation of stable sulfur polymers which further compromised thermal regeneration."
[5] "H2S adsorption on cluster models of metal-exchanged ZSM-12 (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn atoms) was investigated using DFT calculations, and the reported enthalpies of adsorption were 77, 77, 90, 58, and 76 kJ/mol, respectively."
[6] "The best-performing zeolites will likely always be from this pool of structures identified with high selectivity over methane; however, the optimal adsorbent will depend on the feed conditions (wet/dry, lean/rich in light hydrocarbons, CO2/H2S proportions)."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental impacts from emissions, and the complexity of the processes involved. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. ODHP consumes less energy compared to traditional processes, emits fewer pollutants, and potentially requires simpler equipment. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly concerning the selection of oxidants and handling the specific difficulties associated with using oxygen.

Answer: The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption, environmental impacts from emissions, and process complexity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by being more energy-efficient, emitting fewer pollutants, and potentially requiring simpler equipment. However, ODHP faces challenges in oxidant selection and managing the complexities associated with using oxygen as the oxidant.
