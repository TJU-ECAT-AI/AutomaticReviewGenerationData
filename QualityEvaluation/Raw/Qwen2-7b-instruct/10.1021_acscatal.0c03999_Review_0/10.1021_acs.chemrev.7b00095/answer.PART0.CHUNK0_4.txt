[1] "Metal adsorbents may be useful as a final polishing step to limit the energy duty for H2S adsorption/regeneration."
[2] "The reaction between H2S and a metal oxide in the absence of O2 belongs to the class of non-catalytic gassolid reactions."
[3] "These studies suggest the possible implications of synthesis recipes on the size, shape, and surface area of the metal oxide particles that can, in turn affect the H2S breakthrough capacity."
[4] "In fact, there are several reports exploring desulfurization using different ZnO morphologies."
[5] "It was also found that conventional regeneration at 300 C using 5% O2 in N2 resulted in a drastic loss of capacity for the regenerated material."
