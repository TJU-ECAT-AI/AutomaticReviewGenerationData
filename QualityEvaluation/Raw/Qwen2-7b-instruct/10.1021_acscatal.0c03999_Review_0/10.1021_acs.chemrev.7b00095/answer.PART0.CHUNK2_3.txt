[1] "The challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high capital costs, and environmental impacts due to the use of fossil fuels and catalysts. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a cleaner and potentially more sustainable alternative."
[2] "One key challenge in ODHP is the selection of the oxidant, which can significantly impact the reaction kinetics, product yields, and selectivity. Traditionally, oxygen has been used as the oxidant, but it presents its own set of challenges."
[3] "Using oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP can lead to the formation of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and other unwanted byproducts, which can affect the environmental impact and product purity."
[4] "Another challenge is the specific challenges associated with using oxygen, such as the potential for combustion reactions, which can compromise the safety and efficiency of the process."
