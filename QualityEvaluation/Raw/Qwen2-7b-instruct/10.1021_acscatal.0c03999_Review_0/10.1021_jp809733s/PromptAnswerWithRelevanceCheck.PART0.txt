Propylene production typically relies on steam cracking or naphtha reforming, which involve high energy consumption and emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative for propylene production. By using air or nitrogen oxide as oxidants, ODHP can produce propylene from propane with less energy input compared to conventional methods. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in determining the yield and selectivity of propylene. Oxygen is commonly used due to its high reactivity, but nitrogen oxide can also be effective, offering a way to reduce the oxygen consumption and potentially decrease emissions. The use of nitrogen oxide as an oxidant introduces specific challenges related to the reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen, which can affect the selectivity towards propylene. The research focuses on the influence of chromium content and its environment on the catalytic properties of CrxSiBEA zeolites, particularly in the context of ODHP with air or nitrogen oxide.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve developing active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes. Vanadium oligomers have been proposed, but their nature and environment are still a topic of discussion. Transition metal ions, like chromium, are considered active in selective oxidation reactions, especially when their amount is low in direct hydrothermal synthesis.

2. A two-step postsynthesis method was developed for incorporating isolated tetrahedral transition metal ions, including vanadium (V), cobalt (Co), and iron (Fe), into BEA zeolite with a low metal content of up to 2 wt %. This method enhances the catalytic activity of the zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

3. Chromium (Cr)-modified zeolites (CrxSiBEA) were characterized using various techniques like XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR. The study aimed to investigate how the content and environment of chromium affect the catalysts' performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with air or nitrogen oxide (N2O).

4. The selectivity towards propene is crucial in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In the presence of air, the selectivity towards propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr. The presence of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites may lead to a slight decrease in the selectivity to propene when the Cr content increases to 3.4 wt %. 

5. In the presence of N2O, the propane conversion is significantly lower than in the presence of air. However, the selectivity towards propene is higher with N2O compared to air. This difference might be attributed to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of the surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于开发用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）生成相应烯烃的活性和选择性催化剂。范德华复合物也已被提出，但它们的性质和环境仍然是讨论的话题。在直接水热合成中，过渡金属离子如铬被认为是选择性氧化反应的活性中心，尤其是当其含量较低时。

2. 开发了一种两步后合成方法，用于将孤立的四面体过渡金属离子（如钒、钴和铁）以低金属含量（至2 wt%）引入BEA沸石中。这种方法增强了改性沸石在丙烷氧化脱氢中的催化活性。

3. 研究了含不同铬含量（CrxSiBEA）的沸石的特性，包括X射线衍射（XRD）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）、紫外可见光散射（DR UVvis）、温度程序还原（TPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和电子顺磁共振（EPR）。研究旨在探讨铬含量及其环境如何影响这些催化剂在空气或氮氧化物（N2O）存在的条件下对丙烷的氧化脱氢性能。

4. 在空气存在下，丙烷转化率随铬含量增加而提高，而丙烯的选择性最高为1.0 wt%的Cr。当Cr含量增加到3.4 wt%时，可能由于额外框架的八面体Cr位点的存在，丙烯的选择性略有下降。

5. 在N2O存在下，丙烷转化率显著低于空气。然而，在N2O中，丙烯的选择性高于空气。这种差异可能归因于Cr在反应条件下的还原程度以及N2O或空气表面氧的性质。

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods includes the inefficiency and high cost. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative for propylene production. ODHP reduces the dependency on fossil fuels, which can lead to cost savings and environmental benefits.

2. Using air as an oxidant in ODHP presents advantages due to its availability and cost-effectiveness. However, it also introduces challenges, including the formation of byproducts like COx and the requirement for higher temperatures to achieve desired conversions.

3. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers higher selectivity towards propene compared to air, which is advantageous for propylene production. Yet, it comes with the limitation of lower propane conversion rates, especially at lower temperatures.

4. The selectivity towards propene in ODHP is highly dependent on the coordination of chromium present in the activated catalyst. Isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with an oxidation state lower than VI are crucial for maintaining high selectivity in both air and N2O environments.

5. The increase in propane conversion with chromium content in the presence of air suggests that the amount of active chromium sites increases, enhancing the catalytic activity.

6. The decrease in selectivity towards propene for a higher chromium content in the presence of air might be attributed to the presence of extra-framework octahedral chromium sites, which can affect the selectivity mechanism.

7. The lower propane conversion in the presence of N2O could be due to the low concentration of isolated octahedral chromium(III) present in the activated catalyst. The essential role of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with an oxidation state lower than VI for maintaining high selectivity is consistent across both air and N2O environments.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括效率低下和成本高。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种可能更高效且环境友好的丙烯生产替代方案来解决这些问题。ODHP减少了对化石燃料的依赖，这可能导致成本节省和环境益处。

2. 使用空气作为氧化剂在ODHP中具有优势，因为它易于获得且成本效益高。然而，它也带来了挑战，包括副产品的形成以及需要更高的温度以实现所需的转化率。

3. 在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP中，丙烯选择性高于空气，这对丙烯生产有利。然而，它带来了在较低温度下较低丙烷转化率的局限性。

4. ODHP中的丙烯选择性高度依赖于激活催化剂中铬的存在形式。低于VI价态的孤立四面体铬位点对于在两种气体环境下保持高选择性至关重要。

5. 铬含量增加时，在空气存在下的丙烷转化率增加表明活性铬位点的数量增加，增强了催化活性。

6. 对于更高铬含量的样品，在空气存在的情况下，丙烯选择性的下降可能归因于额外框架的八面体铬位点的存在，这些位点可能会影响选择性机制。

7. 在N2O存在的条件下，丙烷转化率的降低可能是由于激活催化剂中存在低浓度的孤立八面体铬（III）。维持高选择性所需的孤立四面体铬位点在空气和N2O环境中是一致的。

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges including high energy consumption, environmental impact, and potentially lower efficiency. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially cleaner process, lower energy consumption, and the ability to selectively produce propene. It presents advantages in terms of product purity and energy efficiency compared to traditional processes.

2. Vanadium-based catalysts have shown activity in ODHP, but the nature and environment of the vanadium sites involved remain a topic of discussion. Chromium (Cr) is also explored due to its potential role in the catalytic process, particularly in influencing alkane conversion rates and selectivity.

3. Oxygen (O2) is commonly used as an oxidant in ODHP, but nitrogen dioxide (N2O) has also been utilized. The choice of oxidant affects the process dynamics and product distribution, with N2O often leading to higher propene selectivity.

4. Zeolites, especially those with a BEA structure, are effective in ODHP, with modifications that incorporate transition metals like iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co). The performance varies among zeolite types, with BEA zeolites showing comparable activity to ZSM-5 in ODHP of propane.

5. A two-step postsynthesis method enhances the incorporation of transition metals into zeolite structures, facilitating the development of active and selective catalysts. This method allows for the introduction of metals with low content, optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity.

6. The content of chromium (Cr) significantly influences the catalytic properties of CrxSiBEA zeolites in ODHP. Higher Cr content typically leads to increased propane conversion, but selectivity towards propene may decrease, possibly due to the presence of extra-framework chromium sites.

7. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers advantages such as higher propene selectivity compared to O2, likely due to the different reactivity of N2O and the nature of surface oxygen formed during the reaction.

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and environmental impact due to the use of steam reforming processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages including lower energy consumption, reduced CO2 emissions, and potential for higher propylene yields compared to traditional methods. However, ODHP presents challenges such as the selection of suitable oxidants and managing the reaction conditions to optimize propene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions. In the context of oxidant selection, N2O has been explored as an alternative to air, potentially offering better control over the reaction process. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include achieving efficient conversion rates, maintaining selectivity towards propene, and managing the formation of coke, which can hinder catalyst performance. The literature discusses how the use of chromium (Cr) in zeolites can affect the activity and selectivity in ODHP, particularly when using air or N2O as oxidants, highlighting the importance of chromium content and coordination state.
