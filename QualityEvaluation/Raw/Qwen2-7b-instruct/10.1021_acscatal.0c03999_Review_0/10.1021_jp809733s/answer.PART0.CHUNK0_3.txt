[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."
[2] "Microporous materials with isolated tetrahedral V(V) have been found to be active and selective catalysts."
[3] "However, vanadium oligomers have also been proposed, and the nature and environment of the V sites involved are still a matter of discussion."
[4] "Catalysis data on ODH of light alkanes suggest that the presence of isolated mononuclear V and Cr ions is a key factor."
[5] "The reducibility and acid-base properties of the active sites are also important factors which can influence the rate of alkane conversion and desorption of the reaction intermediate."
[6] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."
[7] "Other zeolites, such as BEA, mordenite, and faujasite, modified with Fe18 and Co20 have been also used."
[8] "BEA and ZSM-5 zeolites show comparable activity for ODH of propane, while mordenite and faujasite are much less active and mainly lead to COx."
[9] "Since framework transition metal ions are considered to be active in selective oxidation reactions and the amount introduced by direct hydrothermal synthesis is usually low, a two-step postsynthesis method was developed."
[10] "It consists first in the removal of Al from BEA zeolite by treatment with nitric acid, followed by the introduction of V by impregnating the resulting SiBEA with NH4VO3 aqueous solution."
[11] "This method allows incorporation of isolated tetrahedral V(V), Co(II), or Fe(III) into BEA zeolite with low metal content (to 2 wt %)."
[12] "In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated."
[13] "The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % shows a very low propane conversion (Figure 8) with COx as main product (Figure 10)."
[14] "Similar results were found for VSiBEA zeolite, which for very low content of V (0.1 wt %) mainly catalyzes total oxidation toward CO2."
[15] "When the Cr content increases to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity toward propene increases to about 50%, while further increase to 3.4 wt % results in a small decrease."
[16] "The low propane conversion may originate from a very low concentration of isolated octahedral Cr(III) present in activated CrxSiBEA."
[17] "The amount of coke formation in the presence of N2O (0.59 wt % of coke, after 5 h on stream) is about 15% lower than that observed in the presence of air."
[18] "In contrast, the selectivity to propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air."
[19] "It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges including high energy consumption, environmental impact, and potentially lower efficiency. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially cleaner process, lower energy consumption, and the ability to selectively produce propene. It presents advantages in terms of product purity and energy efficiency compared to traditional processes.

2. Vanadium-based catalysts have shown activity in ODHP, but the nature and environment of the vanadium sites involved remain a topic of discussion. Chromium (Cr) is also explored due to its potential role in the catalytic process, particularly in influencing alkane conversion rates and selectivity.

3. Oxygen (O2) is commonly used as an oxidant in ODHP, but nitrogen dioxide (N2O) has also been utilized. The choice of oxidant affects the process dynamics and product distribution, with N2O often leading to higher propene selectivity.

4. Zeolites, especially those with a BEA structure, are effective in ODHP, with modifications that incorporate transition metals like iron (Fe) and cobalt (Co). The performance varies among zeolite types, with BEA zeolites showing comparable activity to ZSM-5 in ODHP of propane.

5. A two-step postsynthesis method enhances the incorporation of transition metals into zeolite structures, facilitating the development of active and selective catalysts. This method allows for the introduction of metals with low content, optimizing the balance between activity and selectivity.

6. The content of chromium (Cr) significantly influences the catalytic properties of CrxSiBEA zeolites in ODHP. Higher Cr content typically leads to increased propane conversion, but selectivity towards propene may decrease, possibly due to the presence of extra-framework chromium sites.

7. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers advantages such as higher propene selectivity compared to O2, likely due to the different reactivity of N2O and the nature of surface oxygen formed during the reaction.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法面临挑战包括高能耗、环境影响和可能的效率较低。氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一个更清洁的过程、更低的能耗以及选择性生产丙烯的优势，来解决这些问题。与传统过程相比，它在产品纯度和能效方面具有优势。

2. 钒基催化剂在ODHP中表现出活性，但涉及的钒位点的性质和环境仍然是讨论的话题。铬（Cr）也被探索，因为它在影响烷烃转化率和选择性方面的作用。

3. 氧（O2）通常作为ODHP中的氧化剂使用，但氮氧化物（N2O）也已被利用。选择的氧化剂影响过程动力学和产物分布，N2O往往导致更高的丙烯选择性。

4. 特别是具有BEA结构的沸石，在ODHP中表现良好，特别是经过修改以引入铁（Fe）和钴（Co）等过渡金属的沸石。不同种类的沸石性能差异，BEA沸石在丙烷ODHP中的活性与ZSM-5相似。

5. 两步后合成方法增强了将过渡金属引入沸石结构的能力，促进了活性和选择性催化剂的发展。这种方法允许以低含量引入金属，优化活动性和选择性的平衡。

6. 铬（Cr）含量显著影响CrxSiBEA沸石在ODHP中的催化性质。较高的Cr含量通常导致丙烷转化率增加，但丙烯选择性可能会下降，这可能与额外框架的Cr位点的存在有关。

7. 使用N2O作为ODHP中的氧化剂提供了优势，如与O2相比更高的丙烯选择性，这可能归因于N2O的反应性和表面氧的性质形成的差异。
