[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."
[2] "Microporous materials with isolated tetrahedral V(V) have been found to be active and selective catalysts."
[3] "However, vanadium oligomers have also been proposed, and the nature and environment of the V sites involved are still a matter of discussion."
[4] "The presence of isolated tetrahedral V(V) sites is a key factor."
[5] "The reducibility and acid-base properties of the active sites are also important factors which can influence the rate of alkane conversion and desorption of the reaction intermediate."
[6] "Since framework transition metal ions are considered to be active in selective oxidation reactions and the amount introduced by direct hydrothermal synthesis is usually low, a two-step postsynthesis method was developed."
[7] "It consists first in the removal of Al from BEA zeolite by treatment with nitric acid, followed by the introduction of V by impregnating the resulting SiBEA with NH4VO3 aqueous solution."
[8] "This method allows incorporation of isolated tetrahedral V(V), Co(II), or Fe(III) into BEA zeolite with low metal content (to 2 wt %)."
[9] "In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated."

Propylene production typically relies on steam cracking or naphtha reforming, which involve high energy consumption and emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative for propylene production. By using air or nitrogen oxide as oxidants, ODHP can produce propylene from propane with less energy input compared to conventional methods. The choice of oxidant plays a crucial role in determining the yield and selectivity of propylene. Oxygen is commonly used due to its high reactivity, but nitrogen oxide can also be effective, offering a way to reduce the oxygen consumption and potentially decrease emissions. The use of nitrogen oxide as an oxidant introduces specific challenges related to the reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen, which can affect the selectivity towards propylene. The research focuses on the influence of chromium content and its environment on the catalytic properties of CrxSiBEA zeolites, particularly in the context of ODHP with air or nitrogen oxide.

丙烯生产通常依赖于蒸汽裂解或轻质烃重整，这涉及高能消耗并产生大量温室气体。氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）提供了一种可能更高效且环境友好的丙烯生产替代方法。通过使用空气或氮氧化物作为氧化剂，ODHP可以从丙烷中生产丙烯，与传统方法相比，能效更高。选择氧化剂对确定丙烯的产率和选择性至关重要。氧气通常被使用，因其反应活性高，但氮氧化物也可以有效使用，提供减少氧气消耗和可能降低排放的方法。使用氮氧化物作为氧化剂引入了一些特定挑战，这些挑战与反应条件和表面氧的性质有关，这可以影响丙烯的选择性。研究集中在铬含量及其环境对CrxSiBEA沸石催化剂催化性能的影响，尤其是在使用空气或氮氧化物进行ODHP的背景下。
