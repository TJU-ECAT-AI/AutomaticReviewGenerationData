[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."

[3] "The presence of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with oxidation state lower than (VI) on activated CrxSiBEA is essential for maintaining a high selectivity."
[4] "In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr."
[5] "The lower selectivity to propene on sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr is probably related to the presence of some amount of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites."
[6] "The propane conversion is lower in the presence of N2O and reaches only 3% at 673 K for Cr3.4SiBEA."
[7] "In contrast, the selectivity to propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air."

1. The primary challenge in current propylene production methods includes the inefficiency and high cost. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative for propylene production. ODHP reduces the dependency on fossil fuels, which can lead to cost savings and environmental benefits.

2. Using air as an oxidant in ODHP presents advantages due to its availability and cost-effectiveness. However, it also introduces challenges, including the formation of byproducts like COx and the requirement for higher temperatures to achieve desired conversions.

3. The use of N2O as an oxidant in ODHP offers higher selectivity towards propene compared to air, which is advantageous for propylene production. Yet, it comes with the limitation of lower propane conversion rates, especially at lower temperatures.

4. The selectivity towards propene in ODHP is highly dependent on the coordination of chromium present in the activated catalyst. Isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with an oxidation state lower than VI are crucial for maintaining high selectivity in both air and N2O environments.

5. The increase in propane conversion with chromium content in the presence of air suggests that the amount of active chromium sites increases, enhancing the catalytic activity.

6. The decrease in selectivity towards propene for a higher chromium content in the presence of air might be attributed to the presence of extra-framework octahedral chromium sites, which can affect the selectivity mechanism.

7. The lower propane conversion in the presence of N2O could be due to the low concentration of isolated octahedral chromium(III) present in the activated catalyst. The essential role of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with an oxidation state lower than VI for maintaining high selectivity is consistent across both air and N2O environments.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括效率低下和成本高。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供一种可能更高效且环境友好的丙烯生产替代方案来解决这些问题。ODHP减少了对化石燃料的依赖，这可能导致成本节省和环境益处。

2. 使用空气作为氧化剂在ODHP中具有优势，因为它易于获得且成本效益高。然而，它也带来了挑战，包括副产品的形成以及需要更高的温度以实现所需的转化率。

3. 在使用N2O作为氧化剂的ODHP中，丙烯选择性高于空气，这对丙烯生产有利。然而，它带来了在较低温度下较低丙烷转化率的局限性。

4. ODHP中的丙烯选择性高度依赖于激活催化剂中铬的存在形式。低于VI价态的孤立四面体铬位点对于在两种气体环境下保持高选择性至关重要。

5. 铬含量增加时，在空气存在下的丙烷转化率增加表明活性铬位点的数量增加，增强了催化活性。

6. 对于更高铬含量的样品，在空气存在的情况下，丙烯选择性的下降可能归因于额外框架的八面体铬位点的存在，这些位点可能会影响选择性机制。

7. 在N2O存在的条件下，丙烷转化率的降低可能是由于激活催化剂中存在低浓度的孤立八面体铬（III）。维持高选择性所需的孤立四面体铬位点在空气和N2O环境中是一致的。
