1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve developing active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes. Vanadium oligomers have been proposed, but their nature and environment are still a topic of discussion. Transition metal ions, like chromium, are considered active in selective oxidation reactions, especially when their amount is low in direct hydrothermal synthesis.

2. A two-step postsynthesis method was developed for incorporating isolated tetrahedral transition metal ions, including vanadium (V), cobalt (Co), and iron (Fe), into BEA zeolite with a low metal content of up to 2 wt %. This method enhances the catalytic activity of the zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

3. Chromium (Cr)-modified zeolites (CrxSiBEA) were characterized using various techniques like XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR. The study aimed to investigate how the content and environment of chromium affect the catalysts' performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with air or nitrogen oxide (N2O).

4. The selectivity towards propene is crucial in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In the presence of air, the selectivity towards propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr. The presence of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites may lead to a slight decrease in the selectivity to propene when the Cr content increases to 3.4 wt %. 

5. In the presence of N2O, the propane conversion is significantly lower than in the presence of air. However, the selectivity towards propene is higher with N2O compared to air. This difference might be attributed to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of the surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于开发用于轻烷烃氧化脱氢（ODH）生成相应烯烃的活性和选择性催化剂。范德华复合物也已被提出，但它们的性质和环境仍然是讨论的话题。在直接水热合成中，过渡金属离子如铬被认为是选择性氧化反应的活性中心，尤其是当其含量较低时。

2. 开发了一种两步后合成方法，用于将孤立的四面体过渡金属离子（如钒、钴和铁）以低金属含量（至2 wt%）引入BEA沸石中。这种方法增强了改性沸石在丙烷氧化脱氢中的催化活性。

3. 研究了含不同铬含量（CrxSiBEA）的沸石的特性，包括X射线衍射（XRD）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）、紫外可见光散射（DR UVvis）、温度程序还原（TPR）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和电子顺磁共振（EPR）。研究旨在探讨铬含量及其环境如何影响这些催化剂在空气或氮氧化物（N2O）存在的条件下对丙烷的氧化脱氢性能。

4. 在空气存在下，丙烷转化率随铬含量增加而提高，而丙烯的选择性最高为1.0 wt%的Cr。当Cr含量增加到3.4 wt%时，可能由于额外框架的八面体Cr位点的存在，丙烯的选择性略有下降。

5. 在N2O存在下，丙烷转化率显著低于空气。然而，在N2O中，丙烯的选择性高于空气。这种差异可能归因于Cr在反应条件下的还原程度以及N2O或空气表面氧的性质。
