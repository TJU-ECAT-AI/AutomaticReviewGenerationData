[1] "Important efforts have been made to develop active and selective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes."
[2] "However, vanadium oligomers have also been proposed, (13) and the nature and environment of the V sites involved are still a matter of discussion."
[3] "Catalysis data on ODH of light alkanes (11, 12, 14-16) suggest that the presence of isolated mononuclear V and Cr ions is a key factor."
[4] "The reducibility and acid-base properties of the active sites are also important factors which can influence the rate of alkane conversion and desorption of the reaction intermediate."
[5] "N2O has recently been used as oxidant for ODH, particularly on Fe and Co-containing ZSM-5."
[6] "Other zeolites, such as BEA, mordenite, and faujasite, modified with Fe18 and Co20 have been also used."
[7] "Since framework transition metal ions are considered to be active in selective oxidation reactions (21-24) and the amount introduced by direct hydrothermal synthesis is usually low, (25, 26) a two-step postsynthesis method was developed."
[8] "It consists first in the removal of Al from BEA zeolite by treatment with nitric acid, followed by the introduction of V by impregnating the resulting SiBEA with NH4VO3 aqueous solution."
[9] "This method allows incorporation of isolated tetrahedral V(V), (27-29) Co(II), (30-32) or Fe(III) (32, 33)into BEA zeolite with low metal content (to 2 wt %)."
[10] "In this work, CrxSiBEA zeolites obtained by this method are characterized by XRD, FTIR, DR UVvis, TPR, XPS, and EPR, and the influence of the content and environment of chromium on their catalytic activity in ODH of propane with air or N2O is investigated."
[11] "The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % shows a very low propane conversion (Figure 8) with COx as main product (Figure 10)."
[12] "Similar results were found for VSiBEA zeolite, which for very low content of V (0.1 wt %) mainly catalyzes total oxidation toward CO2."
[13] "When the Cr content increases to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity toward propene increases to about 50%, while further increase to 3.4 wt % results in a small decrease."
[14] "The presence of coke does not influence the catalysts oxidative activity, suggesting that the sites promoting the ODH are not involved in the formation of coke."
[15] "The low propane conversion may originate from a very low concentration of isolated octahedral Cr(III) present in activated CrxSiBEA."
[16] "The amount of coke formation in the presence of N2O (0.59 wt % of coke, after 5 h on stream) is about 15% lower than that observed in the presence of air."

The primary challenge in current propylene production methods is the high energy consumption and environmental impact due to the use of steam reforming processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers several advantages including lower energy consumption, reduced CO2 emissions, and potential for higher propylene yields compared to traditional methods. However, ODHP presents challenges such as the selection of suitable oxidants and managing the reaction conditions to optimize propene yield while minimizing unwanted side reactions. In the context of oxidant selection, N2O has been explored as an alternative to air, potentially offering better control over the reaction process. The specific challenges associated with using oxygen include achieving efficient conversion rates, maintaining selectivity towards propene, and managing the formation of coke, which can hinder catalyst performance. The literature discusses how the use of chromium (Cr) in zeolites can affect the activity and selectivity in ODHP, particularly when using air or N2O as oxidants, highlighting the importance of chromium content and coordination state.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是高能耗和环境影响，因为使用蒸汽重整过程。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）提供了几个优势，包括较低的能量消耗、减少二氧化碳排放以及与传统方法相比可能更高的丙烯产量。然而，ODHP面临挑战，如合适的氧化剂选择和管理反应条件以优化丙烯产率的同时减少副反应。在氧化剂选择方面，已经探索了使用氮气氧化物（N2O），这可能提供更好的反应过程控制。使用氧气的具体挑战包括实现高效的转化速率、保持向丙烯的选择性以及管理焦炭的形成，这可能会阻碍催化剂性能。文献讨论了在空气或N2O作为氧化剂的情况下，铬（Cr）在沸石中的使用如何影响活性和选择性，特别是在使用空气或N2O进行ODHP时，强调了铬含量和配合状态的重要性。
