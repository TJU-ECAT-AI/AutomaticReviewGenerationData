6. "A Livingston plot of He et al.'s kinetic data.32 The theoretical slope for the reaction for monovalent ions (zA=zB) has been shown for saturated water at T = 350C and is consistent with the slopes of both the H2S and CO2 yield observed by these authors."
</quotes>

6. A graph illustrating the Livingston plot of He et al.'s kinetic data. The theoretical slope for reactions involving monovalent ions (zA=zB) is depicted for saturated water at T = 350C and aligns with the slopes observed for both the H2S and CO2 yields reported by these authors.
