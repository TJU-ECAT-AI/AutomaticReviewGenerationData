1. Steam reformation is too slow under in situ steam stimulation conditions, hence it is not considered as the main pathway for H2S production. Instead, the steam reformation of hydrogen and subsequent hydrogenation of organosulfur compounds is rarely viewed as a significant contributor to H2S production. 

2. The majority of CO2 produced during in situ stimulation is released from carbonate minerals.

3. Chemical rate models are typically tailored for specific applications rather than being universally applicable across various hydrocarbon types.

4. Most models are created to be fit-for-purpose, meaning they are designed for specific scenarios rather than being generalized for a wide array of hydrocarbon types.

5. Due to the slowness of steam reformation under in situ steam stimulation conditions, hydrogenation of organosulfur compounds is not considered as a major pathway for H2S production.

1. 在现场蒸汽刺激条件下，蒸汽重整速度过慢，因此它不被视为主要的H2S产生途径。相反，氢蒸汽重整和随后的有机硫化合物氢化很少被视为H2S生成的主要贡献者。

2. 在原位刺激过程中产生的大部分二氧化碳是从碳酸盐矿物释放的。

3. 化学速率模型通常是为了特定应用而开发的，而不是普遍适用于各种烃类型。

4. 大多数模型是为特定情况设计的，这意味着它们是为了特定场景而定制的，而不是为了广泛的各种烃类型进行泛化的。

5. 由于在原位蒸汽刺激条件下蒸汽重整速度过慢，因此有机硫化合物的氢化不被认为是主要的H2S生成途径。
