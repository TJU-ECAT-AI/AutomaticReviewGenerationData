The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and the emission of greenhouse gases. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. ODHP can reduce the need for fossil fuels and decrease carbon dioxide emissions. However, selecting the right oxidant, such as oxygen, presents its own set of challenges. Oxygen is highly reactive and can cause rapid decomposition of the reactants, affecting the yield and selectivity of propylene. Moreover, the process of using oxygen as an oxidant requires careful control of the reaction conditions to prevent the formation of unwanted byproducts and ensure a stable operation. Despite these challenges, ODHP offers significant advantages, including higher propylene yields and lower energy consumption compared to traditional methods.

The document discusses various challenges and solutions in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production and management in oil and gas production. The main sources of H2S include aquathermolysis, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), and thermal sulfate reduction (TSR). Aquathermolysis is temperature-dependent and highly dependent on the composition of the bitumen. MSR is typically responsible for souring in shallow reservoirs or during water flooding. TSR, especially in conventional carbonate reservoirs, contributes to the production of H2S through the conversion of sulfur content into H2S or by producing excess amounts during production. The document emphasizes that while H2S can originate from various sources, it is essential to anticipate its presence in various stages of oil and gas production to manage it efficiently.

Regarding the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), the document does not provide specific details on the advantages and limitations of using oxygen as an oxidant. However, it suggests that the process faces challenges in terms of reaction kinetics and the need for precise control of reaction conditions to achieve efficient propylene production. The document highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of various H2S production pathways and the role of different reagents and conditions in these processes. It also mentions the delayed appearance of H2S in unconventional shale gas production, possibly due to the oxidation of native H2S or the action of chemical additives in hydraulic fracturing fluids.

The document indicates that the rate of thermal sulfate reduction (TSR) can vary significantly with pH. Faster rates are observed at lower pH values, which shifts the equilibrium reaction towards the formation of elemental sulfur. This finding has implications for understanding the kinetics of TSR in reservoir conditions, as it suggests that the presence of acid conditions can enhance the rate of H2S production. The absence of a significant change in reaction rate with increased ionic strength in recent studies suggests that the rate-limiting step involves the reaction between two neutral species, such as elemental sulfur and an organic compound.

The document discusses the challenges and advancements in managing H2S in oil and gas production, emphasizing the importance of understanding the various sources and mechanisms of H2S generation. It highlights the potential for using different reagents and conditions to manage H2S production and proposes ongoing research efforts to develop kinetic models for predicting H2S production profiles in unconventional reservoirs.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗和温室气体排放。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能且环境友好的替代方案，解决了这些问题。ODHP可以减少对化石燃料的需求并降低二氧化碳排放量。然而，选择合适的氧化剂，如氧气，也带来了自己的挑战。氧气具有高度反应性，可能导致反应物快速分解，影响丙烯的产率和选择性。此外，使用氧气作为氧化剂的过程需要精确控制反应条件，以防止形成副产品并确保稳定运行。尽管存在这些挑战，ODHP仍然提供了显著优势，包括与传统方法相比更高的丙烯产率和更低的能量消耗。

文献讨论了油和气生产中氢硫化物（H2S）产生和管理的各种挑战和解决方案。H2S的主要来源包括水热解、微生物硫酸还原（MSR）和热硫酸还原（TSR）。水热解受温度和石蜡成分的影响很大。MSR通常负责浅层储层或水驱油过程中的酸化。TSR，在常规碳酸盐储层中，通过将硫含量转化为H2S或在生产过程中产生过量的H2S，贡献了H2S的产生。文献强调，尽管H2S可以从各种来源产生，但在整个油和气生产过程中管理其存在是至关重要的。

关于氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP），文献没有提供具体细节，说明使用氧气作为氧化剂的优点和局限性。然而，它暗示该过程面临着反应动力学的挑战和需要精确控制反应条件来实现高效的丙烯生产。文献强调了理解各种H2S产生途径背后机制的重要性以及不同试剂和条件在这类过程中的作用。它还提到了非常规页岩气生产中H2S出现延迟的可能性，这可能是由于原生H2S的氧化或在压裂流体添加剂的作用下。

文献指出，热硫酸还原（TSR）的速率随pH值变化而变化。在较低pH值下观察到更快的速率，这使平衡反应向形成元素硫的方向偏移。这一发现对理解在储层条件下TSR的动态有重要影响，因为它表明酸性条件的存在可以增强H2S的生成速率。最近的研究结果表明，在增加离子强度的情况下，反应速率没有显著变化，这表明速率限制步骤涉及两个中性物种之间的反应，例如元素硫和有机化合物。

文献讨论了油和气生产中管理H2S的挑战和进展，强调了理解各种H2S产生源和机制的重要性。它突出了使用不同试剂和条件管理H2S产生的潜力，并提出了在非常规储层中开发预测H2S产生模式的动态模型的持续研究努力。
