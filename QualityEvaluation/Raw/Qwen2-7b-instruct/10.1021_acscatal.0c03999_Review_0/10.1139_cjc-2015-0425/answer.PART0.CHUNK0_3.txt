The document discusses various sources of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in oil and gas production, including aquathermolysis, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), and thermal sulfate reduction (TSR). It highlights that steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and hydraulic fracturing can contribute to H2S production, especially in unconventional resources. The document also mentions that at higher temperatures, the kinetic regime shifts from sulfur oxidation to thermolysis, complicating the extrapolation of laboratory results to field conditions. Recent studies indicate that hydraulic fracturing additives can undergo TSR reactions under hydrothermal conditions, contributing to H2S production in shale gas reservoirs. The document suggests that elemental sulfur (S) plays a crucial role in the TSR reaction rate, especially at lower temperatures, and that the reaction mechanism differs between temperature regimes. It concludes by emphasizing the importance of considering different kinetic regimes when modeling H2S production in oil and gas reservoirs.

文档讨论了油气生产中氢化硫（H2S）的各种来源，包括水热反应、微生物硫酸还原（MSR）和热硫酸还原（TSR）。它强调了蒸汽辅助重力排水（SAGD）和水力压裂在非常规资源中可以导致H2S产生。文档还提到，在较高温度下，反应动力学从硫氧化转变为热裂解，这使得将实验室结果外推到现场条件变得复杂。最近的研究表明，水力压裂添加剂在高温条件下可以进行TSR反应，导致页岩气藏中H2S的产生。文档指出，元素硫（S）在低温下对TSR反应速率起着关键作用，并且不同温度范围下的反应机制不同。它总结说，在考虑油气藏中H2S生成的动力学时，需要考虑不同的动力学制度。
