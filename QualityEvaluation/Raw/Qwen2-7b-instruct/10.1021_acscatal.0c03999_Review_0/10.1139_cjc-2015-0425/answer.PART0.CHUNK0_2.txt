[1] "Over the 50 year history of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Calgary, both industry and academic researchers have enjoyed a strong collaborative interface through Alberta Sulphur Research Ltd. (ASRL)."
[2] "The first portion of this study contains a brief review of three reservoir souring mechanisms: (i) aquathermolysis, (ii) microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) and (iii) thermal sulfate reduction (TSR)."
[3] "With the non-biological cases of H2S production, there have been several laboratory and field studies aimed at understanding and modelling H2S production kinetics."
[4] "Results reported in this study show no significant change in reaction rate with increased ionic strength, suggesting that the rate limiting step involves a reaction between two neutral reactants."
[5] "Our studies on TSR in shale type fluids are continuing, with the eventual goal of developing a kinetic model to aid producers in estimating H2S production profiles."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental concerns, and operational complexity. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient, environmentally friendly, and simpler process. It converts propane directly into propylene, bypassing the need for costly and energy-intensive intermediate steps like steam cracking. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in the selection of oxidant and the specific difficulties encountered when using oxygen as the oxidant.

ODHP's advantages include lower energy consumption, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and the ability to operate at lower temperatures compared to conventional methods. Oxygen, chosen as the oxidant in ODHP, presents challenges due to its high cost, safety issues, and potential for oxygen leaks, which can lead to explosive atmospheres. These challenges necessitate careful handling and management of the oxygen supply and process conditions to ensure safety and efficiency. Despite these challenges, the use of oxygen in ODHP offers a promising route towards more sustainable propylene production.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、环境问题和操作复杂性。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供更节能、环境友好且更简单的过程解决了这些问题。它直接将丙烷转化为丙烯，避免了昂贵且耗能的中间步骤，如蒸汽裂解。然而，ODHP存在自身的一系列挑战，尤其是在选择氧化剂以及在使用氧气作为氧化剂时遇到的具体困难。

ODHP的优势包括更低的能耗、减少的温室气体排放和在较低温度下运行的能力，与传统方法相比。氧气被选作ODHP的氧化剂，带来了成本高、安全问题和潜在的氧气泄漏等挑战，这可能导致爆炸性气氛。这些挑战需要仔细处理氧气供应和过程条件以确保安全性和效率。尽管如此，使用氧气进行ODHP为可持续的丙烯生产提供了有前景的途径。
