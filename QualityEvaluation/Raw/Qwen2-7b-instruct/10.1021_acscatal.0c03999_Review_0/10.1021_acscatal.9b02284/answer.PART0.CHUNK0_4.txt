The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve high energy consumption and environmental impact due to thermal cracking processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) tackles these issues by providing a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. However, ODHP has its own set of challenges, especially in selecting oxidants and dealing with the specific difficulties of using oxygen. Oxygen's reactivity and potential for combustion necessitate careful consideration when employing it in ODHP.
