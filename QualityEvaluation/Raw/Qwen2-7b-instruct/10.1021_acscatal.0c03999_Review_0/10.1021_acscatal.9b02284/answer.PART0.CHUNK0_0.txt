The primary challenges in current propylene production methods, including thermal cracking of naphtha, are high energy consumption and substantial CO2 emissions, which are significant environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing energy usage and CO2 output. Oxygen is commonly used as an oxidant in ODHP processes due to its abundance and cost-effectiveness, but its high reactivity can cause undesired side reactions and affect product selectivity. To overcome these challenges, researchers have created supported boron oxide catalysts that can selectively convert propane to propylene under milder conditions, offering benefits like enhanced selectivity and lower operational temperatures compared to conventional techniques.

当前丙烯生产方法，如石脑油热裂解，面临的首要挑战是高能耗和大量二氧化碳排放，这是重大的环境问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过可能降低能源消耗和CO2排放量来解决这些问题。由于氧气的可用性和成本效益，它在ODHP过程中广泛被用作氧化剂。然而，氧气的高反应性可能导致不希望的副反应并影响产品选择性。为克服这些挑战，研究人员开发了支持型硼氧化物催化剂，可在温和条件下选择性地将丙烷转化为丙烯，提供改进的选择性和更低的操作温度等优势，与传统方法相比。
