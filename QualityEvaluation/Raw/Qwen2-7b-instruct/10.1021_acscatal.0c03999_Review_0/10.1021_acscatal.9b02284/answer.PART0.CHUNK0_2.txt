1. Current propylene production methods face challenges such as high energy consumption, low yield, and environmental concerns. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering the potential for higher yields and lower energy consumption. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, especially concerning the selection of oxidant and the requirement for high operating temperatures. Using oxygen as the oxidant poses the challenge of its high reactivity leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts. Additionally, the process necessitates elevated temperatures to ensure complete conversion, which increases energy consumption.
