The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are high energy consumption and a large carbon footprint. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a more energy-efficient method for propylene production. However, ODHP has its own set of advantages and limitations, particularly concerning oxidant selection. The use of oxygen as an oxidant in ODHP offers advantages due to its low cost and environmental friendliness. Yet, the use of oxygen also brings specific challenges, such as the risk of forming byproducts like peroxides and the possibility of thermal instability.
