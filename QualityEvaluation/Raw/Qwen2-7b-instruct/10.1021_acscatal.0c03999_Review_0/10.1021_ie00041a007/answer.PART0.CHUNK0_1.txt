[1] "The main obstacle to the wide use of C02 is its low concentration in the atmosphere, comprising only 0.03%."
[2] "Unlike metal catalysts manganese oxide based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction."
[3] "In the case of propane conversion with carbon dioxide, the oxidative cracking (reactions 20-22) prevails over the oxidative dehydrogenation C4HIo + C02 = C4H8 + CO + H,O and thermal dehydrogenation."
[4] "The general trends of propane conversion with carbon dioxide are similar to those observed for ethane transformation; see scheme 13."
[5] "The reason for this is the absence of metallic inclusions in the catalyst (CrO or MnO) and the quick removal of the metal nuclei of the carbon phase by the Boudouard reaction CO, + c *  - 2 c o ."

1. The main barrier to the extensive application of CO2 is its minimal atmospheric concentration, accounting for just 0.03%.
2. Manganese oxide-based catalysts do not generate a carbon layer during reactions, unlike metal catalysts.
3. During propane conversion with CO2, oxidative cracking (reactions 20-22) is predominant over oxidative dehydrogenation and thermal dehydrogenation.
4. The patterns observed in propane conversion with CO2 are analogous to those seen in ethane transformation.
5. Filament-shaped carbon is not formed due to the lack of metallic components (CrO or MnO) in the catalyst and the swift elimination of carbon phase metal nuclei through the Boudouard reaction.

1. CO2广泛应用的主要障碍是其在大气中的浓度极低，仅占0.03%。
2. 与金属催化剂不同，锰氧化物基催化剂在反应过程中不会形成碳层。
3. 在丙烷与CO2的转化中，氧化裂解（反应20-22）占主导地位，超过氧化脱氢化和热脱氢化。
4. 丙烷与CO2的转化模式与乙烷转化观察到的模式类似。
5. 由于催化剂中不存在金属成分（CrO或MnO），并且碳相中的金属核通过布杜瓦德反应迅速被快速去除，因此不会形成纤维状碳。
