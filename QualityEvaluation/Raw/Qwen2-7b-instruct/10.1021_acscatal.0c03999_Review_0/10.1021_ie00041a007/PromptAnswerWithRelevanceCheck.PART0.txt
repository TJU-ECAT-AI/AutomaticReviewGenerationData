1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods is the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which comprises only 0.03%. Manganese oxide-based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction, unlike metal catalysts. Redox reactions with CO2 as an oxidant are more suitable for large-scale CO2 use. Manganese oxide catalysts provide high conversions of both CH4 and CO2 in these reactions. The rate of ethane dehydrogenation by CO2 is governed by the catalyst's oxidation and reduction rates. In the absence of a catalyst, ethylene does not react with CO2. The kinetic equation for butadiene accumulation in the reaction includes the rate constant of ethylene's homogeneous pyrolysis.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是大气中二氧化碳的浓度极低，仅为0.03%。锰氧化物基催化剂在反应过程中不会形成碳层，与金属催化剂不同。作为氧化剂参与的CO2的红氧化还原反应更适合大规模CO2的使用。这些反应中，锰氧化物催化剂可以提供高转化率的甲烷和二氧化碳。乙烷通过CO2进行脱氢的速率由催化剂的氧化和还原速率决定。没有催化剂的情况下，乙炔不会与CO2发生反应。但丁酸酐积累反应的动力学方程包括了乙炔均相裂解的速率常数。

1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods is the low atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, which comprises only 0.03% of the atmosphere. This limits the widespread use of carbon dioxide as a feedstock.

2. Manganese oxide-based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction, unlike metal catalysts. This property is beneficial for processes involving carbon dioxide.

3. Redox reactions, where carbon dioxide acts as an oxidant, are more suitable for large-scale utilization of carbon dioxide.

4. In the reaction of carbon dioxide with propane, there is no inhibiting effect from propane itself. This suggests that propane can interact with carbon dioxide without hindrance.

5. The patterns observed in propane conversion with carbon dioxide are analogous to those seen in ethane conversion. Scheme 13 illustrates this similarity.
