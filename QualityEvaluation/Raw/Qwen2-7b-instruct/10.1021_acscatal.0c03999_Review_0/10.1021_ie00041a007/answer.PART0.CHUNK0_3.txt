1. The main challenge in current propylene production methods is the low atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, which comprises only 0.03% of the atmosphere. This limits the widespread use of carbon dioxide as a feedstock.

2. Manganese oxide-based catalysts do not form a carbon layer during the reaction, unlike metal catalysts. This property is beneficial for processes involving carbon dioxide.

3. Redox reactions, where carbon dioxide acts as an oxidant, are more suitable for large-scale utilization of carbon dioxide.

4. In the reaction of carbon dioxide with propane, there is no inhibiting effect from propane itself. This suggests that propane can interact with carbon dioxide without hindrance.

5. The patterns observed in propane conversion with carbon dioxide are analogous to those seen in ethane conversion. Scheme 13 illustrates this similarity.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是二氧化碳在大气中的浓度极低，仅占0.03%，这限制了二氧化碳作为原料的广泛应用。

2. 与金属催化剂相比，锰氧化物基催化剂在反应过程中不会形成碳层。这一特性对涉及二氧化碳的过程有益。

3. 氧化还原反应，其中二氧化碳充当氧化剂，在大规模二氧化碳利用方面更具代表性。

4. 在二氧化碳与丙烷的反应中，没有从丙烷本身产生抑制作用。这意味着丙烷可以与二氧化碳进行交互而不受阻碍。

5. 观察到的丙烷与二氧化碳转化的模式与乙烷转化的模式相似。方案13展示了这种相似性。
