[1] "In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy."
[2] "Moreover, capital and operational efficiencies are gained by eliminating the need for a furnace,decoking shutdowns,lower operating temperatures,fewer material demands, fewer maintenance operations and the use of a greater proportion of the alkanes in the olefin conversion process."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non- oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct (eqn (19))."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs, high greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, capital investment, operational costs, frequent furnace usage, decoking shutdowns, high operating temperatures, high material demands, and high maintenance requirements. Catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 address these issues by reducing costs, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy, eliminating the need for furnaces and decoking, allowing for lower operating temperatures, reducing material demands, minimizing maintenance operations, and enabling a higher proportion of alkanes to be used in the olefin conversion process.

2. The oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes presents an attractive route to alkenes because it is exothermic and circumvents the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct. This makes it a potentially viable alternative for propylene production.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高成本、高温室气体排放、能源消耗、资本投资、运营成本、频繁使用炉子、脱焦停工、高操作温度、高材料需求和高维护要求。以二氧化碳为催化剂的脱氢过程解决了这些问题，通过降低成本、降低温室气体排放、节省能源、消除炉子和脱焦的需要、允许使用较低的操作温度、减少材料需求、减少维护操作、使更多比例的烷烃用于烯烃转化过程。

2. 对于轻烷烃的氧化脱氢提供了一种吸引人的制备烯烃的途径，因为它是一个放热反应，并且通过形成水作为副产品绕过了非氧化路线的热力学限制。这使得它成为丙烯生产的潜在可行替代方案。

[1] "In the case of 1pu and 1pg, the splitting is not very large."
[2] "The 2pu orbital degeneracy splits into two components, 2bl and 6al."
[3] "The 2pu-6a1 molecular orbital is important in determining the bond angle, since this is the only valence orbital for which the bent molecule is strongly favored."

3. For the orbitals 1pu and 1pg, the splitting is relatively small. The 2pu orbital's degeneracy splits into two components, 2bl and 6al. This 2pu-6a1 molecular orbital plays a crucial role in defining the bond angle because it is the only valence orbital where the bent molecule is significantly preferred.

3. 对于轨道1pu和1pg，分裂相对较小。2pu轨道的退激分裂成两个成分，2bl和6al。这个2pu-6a1分子轨道在确定键角方面起着关键作用，因为它是在弯曲分子显著优选的唯一价轨道。
