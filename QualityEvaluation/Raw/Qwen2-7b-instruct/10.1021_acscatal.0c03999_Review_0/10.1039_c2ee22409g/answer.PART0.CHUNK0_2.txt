<p>Propene is produced from fossil fuelspetroleum, natural gas and, to a much lesser extent, coal. The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene.</p>
<p>There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking.</p>
<p>In addition to these, the most widely practised technology in the Middle East is propane dehydrogenation due to the abundance of oil/gas resources. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene.</p>
<p>Michorczyk and Ogonowski have studied the effect of temperature on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8 with and without CO2 over metal oxides (Ga2O3, Cr2O3 and Fe2O3) supported and unsupported on g-Al2O3 and SiO2. Furthermore, they have also studied the effect of the ratio of CO2 to C3H8 on the equilibrium conversion of C3H8.</p>
<p>The equilibrium conversion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 was much higher than in the absence of CO2 and these studies have led to the further utilization of CO2 as an oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.</p>

1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, environmental issues, and thermodynamic limitations. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly process. It reduces the need for high temperatures and minimizes the formation of unwanted byproducts.

2. Alternative methods for propene production include olefin metathesis, methanol-to-propene conversion, and olefin cracking. These methods also face challenges such as complex reaction pathways and energy requirements.

3. Propane dehydrogenation is commonly practiced in the Middle East due to the abundance of oil and gas resources. It involves converting propane to propene, with oxidative dehydrogenation being one of the studied techniques.

4. Michorczyk and Ogonowski's research focused on the effect of temperature and CO2 concentration on propane dehydrogenation. They found that the presence of CO2 significantly increased the equilibrium conversion of propane, suggesting its potential use as an oxidant in propane dehydrogenation.

5. The incorporation of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation processes not only enhances conversion rates but also enables the utilization of CO2 as an additional reagent, contributing to the mitigation of environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions.
