[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields."
[2] "The CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes offers a potentially attractive route to alkenes, since the reaction is exothermic and avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes by forming water as a byproduct."
[3] "In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, high costs, and high greenhouse gas emissions. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic, leading to the formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, which decrease alkene yields. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering an exothermic reaction that avoids the thermodynamic constraints of non-oxidative routes and produces water as a byproduct. This reduces costs, lowers greenhouse gas emissions, and saves energy compared to traditional methods. ODHP presents advantages such as potential energy savings and reduced environmental impact. However, it faces challenges in oxidant selection and the specific difficulties associated with using oxygen. Alternative technologies like olefin metathesis, methanol-to-propene conversion, and olefin cracking have been developed to produce propene. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one of the technologies that has been studied for the production of propene, meeting the high global demands for propene as a key petrochemical product.
