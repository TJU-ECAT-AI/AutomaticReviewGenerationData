[1] "Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic58 and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields."

[2] "In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy."

[3] "Moreover, capital and operational efficiencies are gained by eliminating the need for a furnace,decoking shutdowns,lower operating temperatures,fewer material demands, fewer maintenance operations and the use of a greater proportion of the alkanes in the olefin conversion process."

[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one technologies that has been studied for the production of propene."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high energy consumption, thermodynamic limitations, the recycling of unreacted reactants, high endothermic energy requirements, and catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. Conventional steam cracking processes are endothermic and lead to the formation of lower molecular weight alkanes and carbon, reducing alkene yields. 

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially reducing costs, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and saving energy. It eliminates the need for furnaces, decoking shutdowns, reduces operating temperatures, decreases material demands, minimizes maintenance operations, and allows for a higher proportion of alkanes to be used in olefin conversion. 

However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection and the specific challenges associated with using oxygen. Oxygen can overcome thermodynamic limitations but leads to significant loss of propene selectivity due to the production of carbon oxides and oxygenates. This makes the selection of an appropriate oxidant crucial for achieving optimal product yields and selectivities.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高能耗、热力学限制、反应物的循环使用、高吸热能量需求以及催化剂由于焦炭形成而失效。传统的蒸汽裂解过程是吸热的，导致低分子烷烃和碳的形成，减少了烯烃的产量。

氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过可能降低成本、减少温室气体排放并节省能源来解决这些问题。它消除了对炉子、除焦停工的需求，降低了操作温度，减少了材料需求，减少了维护操作，并允许更多比例的烷烃用于烯烃转化。

然而，ODHP也带来了自己的一系列挑战，特别是在选择氧化剂和与氧气相关的特定挑战方面。氧气可以克服热力学限制，但会导致丙烯选择性的显著损失，因为会产生碳氧化物和氧化物。因此，选择合适的氧化剂对于实现最佳产品产率和选择性至关重要。
