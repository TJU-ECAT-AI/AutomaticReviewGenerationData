The global demands for propene are very high as it is the second most important starting product in the petrochemical industry after ethylene. There have been several alternative technologies that have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, which involves disproportionation between ethylene and butene, methanol-to-propene conversion and olefin cracking.

In comparison with the conventional steam-cracking method of dehydrogenating alkanes to olefins, catalytic dehydrogenation processes with CO2 could reduce costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and save energy. Moreover, capital and operational efficiencies are gained by eliminating the need for a furnace, decoking shutdowns, lower operating temperatures, fewer material demands, fewer maintenance operations and the use of a greater proportion of the alkanes in the olefin conversion process.

Non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are endothermic and lead to the concurrent formation of carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, both of which decrease alkene yields.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs, significant greenhouse gas emissions, and inefficiencies related to energy consumption, maintenance, and material demands. Steam cracking, a common method, involves high temperatures, consumes a large amount of energy, and requires furnaces and decoking operations, which are costly and energy-intensive. Additionally, this process leads to the formation of byproducts like carbon and lower molecular weight alkanes, reducing the efficiency of propylene production.

Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a more cost-effective, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly alternative. It reduces costs by eliminating the need for furnaces, decoking shutdowns, and the use of high energy inputs. It also decreases greenhouse gas emissions and improves operational efficiencies through lower temperatures, reduced material demands, and minimized maintenance operations. ODHP allows for a higher proportion of propane to be used effectively in propylene production, enhancing overall efficiency.

ODHP presents its own set of challenges, particularly in oxidant selection and the specific difficulties associated with using oxygen. The endothermic nature of non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions means they produce lower alkene yields. In contrast, ODHP utilizes CO2 as a soft oxidant, which can help overcome thermodynamic limitations and increase propylene yields. However, the selectivity for propene production can be compromised when using oxygen as the oxidant, as it may lead to the over-oxidation of propane to carbon dioxide and other oxygenates. Proper oxidant selection and optimization of reaction conditions are crucial to achieving optimal propylene yields while minimizing unwanted byproducts.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括高昂的成本、大量温室气体排放以及与能源消耗、维护和材料需求相关的效率低下。蒸汽裂解是一种常见的方法，涉及高温、大量能量消耗，并需要炉子和焦化操作，这些既昂贵又耗能。此外，这种过程还会形成碳和较低分子量烷烃等副产品，降低丙烯生产的效率。

氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供更经济、更节能、环境友好的替代方案来解决这些问题。它通过消除炉子、焦化停工、高能输入等需求，降低成本。它还能减少温室气体排放，并通过降低温度、减少材料需求和最小化维护操作提高运营效率。ODHP允许使用更多的丙烷有效地进行丙烯生产，从而提高整体效率。

ODHP也存在自己的挑战，特别是在选择氧化剂和使用氧气时的具体困难。非氧化性脱氢反应的吸热性质意味着它们会产生较低的烯烃产率。相比之下，ODHP利用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂，可以帮助克服热力学限制并增加丙烯产量。然而，当使用氧气作为氧化剂时，可能会导致丙烷过度氧化为二氧化碳和其他氧化物，从而影响丙烯的选择性。适当的氧化剂选择和优化反应条件对于实现最佳丙烯产量同时减少不期望的副产品的产生至关重要。
