[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory."
[3] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."
[5] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[6] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[7] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high cost and capital investment associated with naphtha steam cracking, the seasonal nature of propane dehydrogenation, the relatively low yield from fluid catalytic cracking units, and the consumption of high-value ethylene in the metathesis process. These methods either produce too much ethylene compared to propylene, have limited profitability due to fluctuating feedstock costs, or consume valuable ethylene resources.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane into propylene more efficiently and cost-effectively. Unlike traditional methods, ODHP offers a direct conversion pathway, potentially reducing the need for additional refining steps and minimizing the consumption of high-value ethylene. However, ODHP faces challenges related to oxidant selection, specifically the choice of an effective and safe oxidant, and the specific technical difficulties associated with maintaining stable and efficient oxidation conditions.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：naphtha蒸汽裂解过程的高昂成本和资本投入、丙烷脱氢过程的季节性、流化床催化裂化单位较低的产率以及在乙烷异构化过程中消耗高价值的乙烯资源。这些方法要么产生过多的乙烯与丙烯，要么由于原料成本波动导致盈利能力有限，或者消耗宝贵的乙烯资源。

2. 烷烃氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过更高效和经济地将丙烷转化为丙烯解决了这些问题。与传统方法相比，ODHP提供了一条直接转换途径，可能减少了额外精炼步骤的需求，并最大限度地减少了对高价值乙烯资源的消耗。然而，ODHP面临着氧化剂选择的具体挑战，特别是有效且安全的氧化剂的选择，以及维持稳定和高效氧化条件的具体技术难题。
