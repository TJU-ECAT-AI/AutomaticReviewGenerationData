<quotes>
[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost-effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."
[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[5] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[6] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."
[7] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to the naphtha steam cracking process and the expense of propane dehydrogenation, which is only cost-effective during specific times of the year. Propylene generation in fluid catalytic cracking units has a relatively low yield, and the metathesis of ethylene and butylenes consumes high-value ethylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by utilizing less valuable feedstock, specifically mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins. Zeolites are advantageous in this process due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, which makes them suitable for industrial applications.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于重质裂解过程的成本高昂以及丙烷脱氢的成本仅在一年中的特定时期有效，导致成本过高。在催化裂化单元中生成丙烯的产量相对较低，而将乙烯和丁二烯进行裂合消耗的是主要原料的高价值部分。通过使用更廉价的原料，即混合的C4-或更高碳数的烯烃，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）解决了这些问题。在这一过程中，使用沸石是合适的，因为它们具有出色的热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，这使得它们适用于工业应用。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to significant investments and high feedstock prices in the naphtha steam cracking process, low propylene yield in FCC units, and the consumption of valuable ethylene in the metathesis process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more cost-effective and efficient method to produce propylene from less valuable feedstock, specifically C4-olefins. The use of zeolites, particularly H-ZSM-5, has shown promise in catalytic cracking for propylene production due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to significant investments and feedstock expenses in naphtha steam cracking, seasonal cost-effectiveness issues with propane dehydrogenation, low propylene yields from FCC units, and consumption of high-value ethylene in metathesis processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a potentially cheaper, year-round, and efficient method for propylene production from less valuable feedstock, such as mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins. However, ODHP presents challenges related to the selection of the oxidant and specific difficulties encountered when using oxygen as the oxidant.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：由于大量投资和原料成本，在焦化气裂解中成本高昂；仅在有限时间内，丙烷氧化脱氢过程的原料成本有效，使得过程昂贵，限制了丙烯的生产；催化裂化装置中产生的丙烯产量相对较低；以及在乙烷和丁烯的裂合过程中消耗了作为主要原料的高价值乙烯。通过从较不值钱的原料（如混合C4或更高碳数的烯烃）中生产丙烯，氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）解决了这些问题，提供了一种可能更便宜、全年有效且高效的方法来利用低价值原料生产丙烯。然而，ODHP在选择氧化剂时以及使用氧气时遇到了特定的挑战。

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to significant capital investment and feedstock expenses in naphtha steam cracking, seasonal fluctuations in propane dehydrogenation, low yields in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and the consumption of high-value ethylene in propylene production through ethylene and butene metathesis. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more cost-effective and consistent source of propylene from less expensive feedstocks. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, primarily related to the selection of an appropriate oxidant. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to complex reaction mechanisms and may require careful control to optimize propylene yield. Specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for efficient heat management to prevent thermal degradation of the feedstock and the potential for formation of byproducts that could reduce overall efficiency.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the high cost and capital investment associated with naphtha steam cracking, the seasonal nature of propane dehydrogenation, the relatively low yield from fluid catalytic cracking units, and the consumption of high-value ethylene in the metathesis process. These methods either produce too much ethylene compared to propylene, have limited profitability due to fluctuating feedstock costs, or consume valuable ethylene resources.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by converting propane into propylene more efficiently and cost-effectively. Unlike traditional methods, ODHP offers a direct conversion pathway, potentially reducing the need for additional refining steps and minimizing the consumption of high-value ethylene. However, ODHP faces challenges related to oxidant selection, specifically the choice of an effective and safe oxidant, and the specific technical difficulties associated with maintaining stable and efficient oxidation conditions.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：naphtha蒸汽裂解过程的高昂成本和资本投入、丙烷脱氢过程的季节性、流化床催化裂化单位较低的产率以及在乙烷异构化过程中消耗高价值的乙烯资源。这些方法要么产生过多的乙烯与丙烯，要么由于原料成本波动导致盈利能力有限，或者消耗宝贵的乙烯资源。

2. 烷烃氧化脱氢（ODHP）通过更高效和经济地将丙烷转化为丙烯解决了这些问题。与传统方法相比，ODHP提供了一条直接转换途径，可能减少了额外精炼步骤的需求，并最大限度地减少了对高价值乙烯资源的消耗。然而，ODHP面临着氧化剂选择的具体挑战，特别是有效且安全的氧化剂的选择，以及维持稳定和高效氧化条件的具体技术难题。
