[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory."
[3] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[4] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost-effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."
[5] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[6] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[7] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[8] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to significant investments and feedstock expenses in naphtha steam cracking, seasonal cost-effectiveness issues with propane dehydrogenation, low propylene yields from FCC units, and consumption of high-value ethylene in metathesis processes. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a potentially cheaper, year-round, and efficient method for propylene production from less valuable feedstock, such as mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins. However, ODHP presents challenges related to the selection of the oxidant and specific difficulties encountered when using oxygen as the oxidant.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：由于大量投资和原料成本，在焦化气裂解中成本高昂；仅在有限时间内，丙烷氧化脱氢过程的原料成本有效，使得过程昂贵，限制了丙烯的生产；催化裂化装置中产生的丙烯产量相对较低；以及在乙烷和丁烯的裂合过程中消耗了作为主要原料的高价值乙烯。通过从较不值钱的原料（如混合C4或更高碳数的烯烃）中生产丙烯，氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）解决了这些问题，提供了一种可能更便宜、全年有效且高效的方法来利用低价值原料生产丙烯。然而，ODHP在选择氧化剂时以及使用氧气时遇到了特定的挑战。
