[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[4] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[6] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."
[7] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[8] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34."
[9] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to significant investments and high feedstock prices in the naphtha steam cracking process, low propylene yield in FCC units, and the consumption of valuable ethylene in the metathesis process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more cost-effective and efficient method to produce propylene from less valuable feedstock, specifically C4-olefins. The use of zeolites, particularly H-ZSM-5, has shown promise in catalytic cracking for propylene production due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：在蒸汽裂解过程中，由于巨大的资本投入和高昂的原料成本，导致成本高企；在催化裂化单位中丙烯的产率相对较低；以及在乙烯的代谢过程中消耗高价值的乙烯。通过丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）来生产丙烯，可以以更经济有效的方式利用价值较低的原料，特别是C4-烯烃。使用沸石，尤其是H-ZSM-5，已经显示出在催化裂解过程中用于丙烯生产的潜力，由于其出色的热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性。
