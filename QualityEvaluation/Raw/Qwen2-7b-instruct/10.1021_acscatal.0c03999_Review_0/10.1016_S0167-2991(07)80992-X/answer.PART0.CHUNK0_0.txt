[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost-effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."
[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[5] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[6] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."
[7] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to the naphtha steam cracking process and the expense of propane dehydrogenation, which is only cost-effective during specific times of the year. Propylene generation in fluid catalytic cracking units has a relatively low yield, and the metathesis of ethylene and butylenes consumes high-value ethylene. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by utilizing less valuable feedstock, specifically mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins. Zeolites are advantageous in this process due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, which makes them suitable for industrial applications.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括由于重质裂解过程的成本高昂以及丙烷脱氢的成本仅在一年中的特定时期有效，导致成本过高。在催化裂化单元中生成丙烯的产量相对较低，而将乙烯和丁二烯进行裂合消耗的是主要原料的高价值部分。通过使用更廉价的原料，即混合的C4-或更高碳数的烯烃，氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）解决了这些问题。在这一过程中，使用沸石是合适的，因为它们具有出色的热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，这使得它们适用于工业应用。
