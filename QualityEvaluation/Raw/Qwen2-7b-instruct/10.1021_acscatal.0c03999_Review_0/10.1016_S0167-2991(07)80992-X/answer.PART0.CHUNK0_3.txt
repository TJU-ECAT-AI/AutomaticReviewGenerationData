[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene."
[4] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[5] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[6] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[7] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include high costs due to significant capital investment and feedstock expenses in naphtha steam cracking, seasonal fluctuations in propane dehydrogenation, low yields in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and the consumption of high-value ethylene in propylene production through ethylene and butene metathesis. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering a potentially more cost-effective and consistent source of propylene from less expensive feedstocks. However, ODHP presents its own set of challenges, primarily related to the selection of an appropriate oxidant. The use of oxygen as an oxidant can lead to complex reaction mechanisms and may require careful control to optimize propylene yield. Specific challenges associated with using oxygen include the need for efficient heat management to prevent thermal degradation of the feedstock and the potential for formation of byproducts that could reduce overall efficiency.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：由于重大资本投资和原料成本高昂，导致焦化裂解过程的成本高；丙烷氧化脱氢的生产具有季节性，导致成本高昂；在催化裂化（FCC）过程中丙烯产量相对较低；以及在通过乙烯和丁烯的裂合生产丙烯时消耗高价值的乙烯。氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过使用更便宜的原料来源，可能提供一种更经济且稳定地生产丙烯的方法，从而解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也面临着一系列挑战，特别是有关选择合适的氧化剂的问题。使用氧气作为氧化剂可能导致复杂的反应机制，并可能需要仔细控制以优化丙烯产率。使用氧气的具体挑战包括有效热管理的需求，以防止原料的热降解，以及可能形成降低总体效率的副产物的风险。
