[1] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:
1. In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the
demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced.
Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[2] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane
conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[3] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes  has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades. As pointed out by Brazdil [2]: The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry. The effectiveness of the catalyst, that is the activity for alkane conversion and the selectivity to desired products, will ultimately determine the economic attractiveness of an alkane-based chemical process."
[4] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks. In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[5] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[6] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[7] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that
may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acidbase characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[8] "In contrast with the above-mentioned findings, the results obtained by Lemonidou and co-workers [27] showed that in titania and zirconia-supported vanadium oxide, the ability of vanadium to activate the CH bond in propane weakens when increasing VOx density."
[9] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in
alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors [27,37,46,47,5175]."
[10] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains
can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[11] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41 [49,100,106111], MCM-48 [112] or SBA-15 [112115]."
[12] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[13] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well- defined active sites."
[14] "In the case of molybdena-based systems:"
[15] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems,including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181,187,189,263269]."
[16] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."

1. The main challenges in current propylene production methods include the slower growth of propylene demand compared to ethylene, especially in Western Europe, and the issue of catalyst deactivation due to coking. The development of catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes addresses these issues by offering the potential for improved energy efficiency and process simplicity, as well as the direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates, which could transform the chemical industry. However, the lower cost of feedstock for current olefin production technologies is not a significant incentive, except for the advantage of improved energy efficiency and process simplicity in ODH.

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes offers the potential for improved energy efficiency (exothermic reactions) and process simplicity compared to dehydrogenation and cracking processes, which are endothermic. This makes ODH a more attractive option for producing olefins from alkanes.

3. The production of olefins through oxidative processes has been a subject of extensive research in recent decades. This could potentially lead to a radical transformation of the chemical industry, as highlighted by Brazdil. The effectiveness of the catalysts, including their activity and selectivity towards desired products, is crucial in determining the economic attractiveness of alkane-based chemical processes.

4. The improved energy efficiency and process simplicity of ODH compared to dehydrogenation and cracking are the key incentives for developing ODH technologies. The exothermic nature of ODH reactions makes it more energy-efficient, and the simpler process structure reduces operational costs.

5. The use of more exothermal reactions in ODH leads to higher energy losses, which in turn result in higher fixed costs, especially considering the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH. This factor needs to be taken into account when evaluating the overall economic viability of ODH technologies.

6. A large number of reviews have been published on the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes since the early 1990s, indicating a significant interest in this area of research.
