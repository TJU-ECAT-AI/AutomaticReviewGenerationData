[1] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"

[2] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."

[3] "At the present time, the main sources of olefins are: steam cracking,fluid-catalytic-cracking,and catalytic dehydrogenation."

[4] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."

[5] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."

[6] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes  has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry."

[7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."

[8] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

[9] "In the case of propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."

[10] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."

[11] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re- oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."

[12] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."

[13] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges in aligning production capacity with market demand, dealing with thermodynamic limitations in alkane conversion, and avoiding catalyst deactivation due to coking. These issues prompt research into oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) as a potentially transformative alternative.

2. ODHP offers the potential to significantly increase olefin production, especially ethylene and propylene, by utilizing lighter alkanes as feedstock. However, the lower cost of feedstock alone is not a compelling incentive, as current technologies already employ high-quality feedstocks.

3. The use of oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP leads to higher energy losses and fixed costs, particularly considering the production of CO2, a significant by-product. Alternative oxidants like N2O or CO2 could offer breakthroughs in addressing these challenges.

4. Catalysts based on supported vanadium oxide demonstrate high activity and selectivity in ODHP, especially when optimized for intermediate-sized VOx domains. These catalysts balance the activity of surface VOx species with their accessibility to reactants.

5. Kinetic studies on ODHP reveal that the dissociation of CH bonds and a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen are crucial steps in activating alkyl species to produce olefins. This mechanism is consistent across both propane and ethane conversions.

6. The extent of vanadium reduction during ODHP is lower than in stoichiometric reduction, with only a fraction of reduced centers actively participating in catalytic turnovers. The rest of the centers are re-oxidized over much longer timescales than turnover times.

7. The use of combinatorial and parallel systems, along with advanced catalyst selection approaches, has significantly expanded the range of catalytic systems that can be explored and developed. This has facilitated the discovery of novel catalysts for ODHP and other chemical transformations.

1. 目前丙烯生产方法面临与市场需求不符、烷烃转化热力学限制以及催化剂因焦化而快速失活等挑战。这些问题推动了丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）作为潜在革命性替代方案的研究。

2. ODHP有可能大幅增加乙烯和丙烯等不饱和烃的产量，利用较轻的烷烃作为原料。然而，仅基于成本较低的原料本身并不是一个有力的激励因素，因为当前技术已经使用高质量的原料。

3. 使用氧气作为氧化剂在ODHP中导致更高的能量损失和固定成本，特别是考虑到CO2的生产，这是烷基氧化的主要副产品。替代氧化剂如N2O或CO2可能解决这些挑战。

4. 基于支持的五氧化二钒催化剂在ODHP中表现出高活性和选择性，尤其是在中间大小的VOx域时。这些催化剂平衡了表面VOx物种的活性与它们对反应物的可接近性。

5. ODHP的动态研究表明，CH键的分解和Mars-van Krevelen还原机制涉及晶格氧激活烷基物种以生成不饱和烃是至关重要的步骤。这一机制在丙烷和乙烷转换中都是一致的。

6. 五价钒的还原程度在ODHP中低于等量还原，只有部分还原中心参与催化周转。其余的中心在远长于周转时间的尺度上重新氧化。

7. 组合和并行系统以及先进的催化剂选择方法的使用显著扩大了可以探索和开发的催化系统的范围。这促进了新型ODHP和其他化学转变催化剂的发现。
