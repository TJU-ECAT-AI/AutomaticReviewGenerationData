[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]."
[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[5] "The production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[6] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[7] "In other words, the potential advantages offered by ODH are not enough to convince companies to abandon well-established technologies, carried out in completely depreciated, highly reliable, and efficient plants, unless a better yield than that currently achieved can be obtained."
[8] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]."
[9] "Indeed, it is quite difficult to obtain a uniform picture concerning those significant catalyst characteristics that determine the performance in alkane ODH, due to the following reasons:"
[10] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[11] "This problem may be overcome in part by studying catalyst characteristics under working conditions (in situ reactivity) and, even more so, by coupling this with a concomitant analysis of the reaction products."
[12] "Nevertheless, sometimes the thorough characterization of the catalyst downloaded post-catalytic tests (the spent catalyst) and the comparison of ante-reaction features may be sufficient to understand whether significant changes in catalyst characteristics occurred during catalytic tests."
[13] "A great number of papers deal with the study of the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in propane and ethane ODH."
[14] "In propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[15] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[16] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+. Furthermore, only a fraction of the reduced centers are active in catalytic turnovers, while the rest are re-oxidized in time scales much longer than turnover times."
[17] "ODH turnover rates increase as the energy of the absorption edge in the UV-visible DR spectrum decreases; the electronic transitions responsible for the absorption edge have been found to be mechanistically related to the redox cycles involving lattice oxygens responsible for ODH turnovers of alkanes."
[18] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[19] "The isomorphous substitution of active metal species,e.g.,vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials is an attractive strategy for designing new catalysts for this reaction."
[20] "For each catalyst,the best olefin yield value is given, obtained in correspondence to a set value of conversion and selectivity."
[21] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."

1. Current propylene production methods face challenges in keeping up with the rapidly increasing demand for propylene, especially in Western Europe, due to the limited production capacity of steam cracking processes. This leads to a growing disparity between propylene demand and supply, necessitating the development of alternative methods like oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents itself as an attractive alternative to traditional propylene production methods because it offers potential energy efficiency improvements and process simplicity. The exothermic nature of ODHP contrasts with the endothermic nature of dehydrogenation and cracking processes, which can lead to higher energy losses and fixed costs. 

3. However, the potential advantages of ODHP are not sufficient to convince companies to abandon established and efficient production technologies unless the yield of propylene surpasses that achievable with current methods. Companies are hesitant to adopt new technologies unless they guarantee a better yield or economic return.

4. The use of oxygen as the oxidant in ODHP processes presents challenges in achieving optimal selectivity and yield. Oxygen lean conditions enhance selectivity towards olefins but may also facilitate reactions leading to hydrogen production, which could affect the redox properties of the gas phase and the nature of the catalyst characteristics.

5. Contrary to the common belief that the choice of catalyst is solely determined by a few specific aspects, such as morphology or electronic properties, the literature suggests that multiple factors can influence the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts in ODHP. A collective interpretation of these factors is lacking, leading to discrepancies in experimental results and a complex understanding of catalyst characteristics.

6. Catalyst performance in ODHP is influenced by a variety of factors, including the degree of agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, valence state of metal cations, and collective electronic properties. The redox properties of the gas phase can dynamically modify the active surface and affect the reaction mechanism, thereby impacting the concentration of by-products and co-products like CO2 and H2O.

7. To address the challenges in ODHP, researchers have turned to advanced experimental techniques that enable in situ characterization of catalysts and the analysis of reaction products. These techniques help in understanding the dynamic changes in catalyst characteristics under working conditions, which can be crucial for optimizing the ODHP process.

8. Catalysts that produce outstanding olefin yields in ODHP are scarce. Most catalysts reported in the literature yield ethylene below 20%, highlighting the need for further advancements in catalyst development and process design.

9. The use of combinatorial and parallel systems, such as genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection, has expanded the scope of catalyst discovery and preparation, contributing to the identification of novel catalysts with improved performance in ODHP.

10. The performance of catalysts for ethane ODH is influenced by the specific elements they contain, such as Ni, Mo, and Nb. These elements interact with the support to modify structural and catalytic properties, enhancing the reactivity of ethane and selectivity towards ethylene production.

11. The addition of alkali metals like Cs, K, and Li to molybdenum oxide catalysts can alter the structure and electronic properties of MoOx domains. This can slow down the initial reduction of MoOx species, affecting the rate-determining CH bond activation step and influencing the selectivity towards propylene.

12. The inclusion of potassium in zirconia-supported molybdenum oxide can prevent the formation of crystalline Zr(MoO4)2 and foster the formation of three-dimensional molybdenum oxide and two-dimensional polymolybdates. This enhances propylene selectivity and yield in ODHP, showcasing the importance of support interactions in catalyst design.

13. Catalyst performance in ODHP is highly dependent on the support used. Different supports can influence the primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of ethane to COx and coke, respectively. The choice of support can affect the catalytic activity and selectivity of the catalyst towards desired products.

14. Catalyst performance in ODHP is not only influenced by the composition of the catalyst but also by the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and feed ratio. These conditions can affect the nature of the catalyst characteristics and the formation of by-products, co-products, and the redox properties of the gas phase.

15. The use of binary dispersed structures, such as VOx-CrOx and VOx-MoOx mixed structures, can significantly increase the propane ODH rate and selectivity compared to pure Al2O3 supports. These structures enable higher propane activation to propylene and prevent consecutive total combustion of propylene, enhancing the overall performance of the catalyst.

16. The addition of additives like phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), niobium (Nb), magnesium (Mg), gold (Au), zinc (Zn), and molybdenum (Mo) can modify the acid-basic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide catalysts. These modifications can affect the total activity and selectivity of the catalyst towards desired products in ODHP.

17. The use of isomorphous substitution of active metal species, such as vanadium, into microporous and mesoporous materials, can lead to the design of new catalysts for ODHP. This approach allows for the isolation of active sites, which is crucial for achieving high selectivities and yields in the reaction.

18. Conversion versus selectivity charts for ethane and propane ODH illustrate the performance of various catalysts. These charts compare the best olefin yield values obtained at specific conversion and selectivity levels, providing insights into the relative performance of different catalysts.

19. Recent advancements in combinatorial and parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection, have enabled the discovery of new catalytic systems with improved performance in ODHP. These systems have contributed significantly to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation.

20. Catalyst performance in ethane ODH varies depending on the type of catalyst used. High-performing catalysts typically involve the interaction of nickel (Ni) with the support, leading to improved dispersion of the nickel phase and enhanced CH bond activation. Promoters like niobium (Nb) have been found to be particularly beneficial for ethane ODH, significantly increasing reactivity while maintaining high ethylene selectivity.
