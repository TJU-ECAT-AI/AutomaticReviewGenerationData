[1] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:
1. In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]."
[2] "Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced."
[3] "Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins."
[4] "Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation."
[5] "In fact, the production of chemicals starting from alkanes by means of oxidative processes has been one of the most studied topics in recent decades."
[6] "As pointed out by Brazdil [2]: The direct conversion of ethane and propane to commodity chemical intermediates has the potential to radically transform the chemical industry."
[7] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[8] "This implies that while in the production of, say,acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH,better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the slower growth rate of propylene demand compared to ethylene, the limited yield from steam cracking and fluid-catalytic-cracking processes, and the issue of rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by potentially offering a more efficient route to propylene production. However, ODHP presents its own set of advantages and limitations. Advantages include the potential for improved energy efficiency due to the exothermic nature of the reaction, the process simplicity, and the possibility of producing specific olefins with unique characteristics. Limitations include the need for catalysts with high activity and selectivity, the requirement for specific reactor configurations or unconventional reaction conduction methods, and the challenge of achieving olefin yields comparable to those obtained with current technologies for alkenes production. Additionally, the choice of oxidant, particularly the use of oxygen, is critical for optimizing the performance of ODHP processes.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括丙烯需求增长速度较慢与乙烯相比，裂解过程产出丙烯量较小以及催化剂快速失活的问题。氧化脱氢法（ODHP）通过可能提供更高效的丙烯生产途径来解决这些问题。然而，ODHP也存在自身的优势和限制。优势包括由于反应为放热性质，因此可能提高能效；过程简单性以及有可能生产具有独特特性的特定烯烃。限制包括需要高效活性和选择性的催化剂，特定反应器配置或非传统反应传导方法的要求，以及实现与当前技术生产烯烃相似的烯烃产率的挑战。此外，选择氧化剂，特别是使用氧气，对于优化ODHP过程性能至关重要。
