[1] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:
1. In steam cracking, ethylene is the preferred product, but the demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, especially in Western Europe [1]. Also, in the case of FCC, smaller amounts of propylene are produced.
Therefore, the current production of olefins is not in line with the forecast market demand for olefins.
2. Dehydrogenations thermodynamic constraints limit alkane conversion; furthermore, a major problem is coking, which causes rapid catalyst deactivation.
Therefore, the need exists for new technologies devoted to the production of specific olefins, which have none of the disadvantages characterizing dehydrogenation."

[2] "In the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks. In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."

[3] "This implies that while in the production of, say,acrylonitrile from propane a yield of 60% is sufficient to obtain a cost equivalency with the current technology from propylene (due to the difference in cost between propane and propylene), in the case of propylene synthesis by propane ODH,better olefin yields are needed than those obtained with current technologies."

[4] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."

[5] "A large number of reviews dealing with the ODH of light alkanes have been published since the early 1990s [421]. In the present review, we attempt to offer an answer to the following questions on the scientific and technological aspects of ethane and propane ODH: Which key factors are the chief determinants of the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts?"

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the mismatch between the demand for propylene and the supply from steam cracking and fluid-catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, where propylene production is insufficient. Additionally, dehydrogenation processes are thermodynamically constrained, leading to limited alkane conversion and the issue of catalyst deactivation due to coking. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering improved energy efficiency (exothermic reactions compared to endothermic dehydrogenation and cracking) and process simplicity. It requires higher olefin yields than current technologies, especially for the production of specific olefins like propylene from propane. However, more exothermal reactions, like those in ODHP, lead to higher energy losses and fixed costs, particularly considering the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH. The review aims to identify the key factors determining the performance of metal oxide-based catalysts in ethane and propane ODH, considering the advancements and challenges in this area since the early 1990s.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和流化床催化裂化（FCC）过程之间需求与供应之间的不匹配，以及在脱氢过程中有限的烷烃转化率和催化剂由于结焦而快速失效的问题。氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）通过提供比脱氢和裂解更高效的能量效率（放热反应与吸热脱氢和裂解相比）和简化的过程来解决这些问题。它需要比现有技术更高的烯烃产率，特别是从丙烷生产丙烯时。然而，更多放热反应，如在ODHP中，导致更高的能量损失和固定成本，特别是考虑到生产CO2，烷基ODHP的主要副产品。本文旨在确定自20世纪90年代初以来在乙烷和丙烷ODH方面确定性能的关键因素，考虑这一领域的进展和挑战。
