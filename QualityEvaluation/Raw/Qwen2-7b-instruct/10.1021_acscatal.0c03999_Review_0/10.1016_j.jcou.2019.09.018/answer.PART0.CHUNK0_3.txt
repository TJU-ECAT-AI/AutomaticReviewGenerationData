[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."
[2] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."
[3] "One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs."
[4] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed."
[5] "From above reasons chromium is typically dispersed on a support. Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."
[6] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."

Propene demand is expected to grow significantly, reaching approximately 130 million tonnes by 2023. Increasing propene production through optimizing existing processes negatively impacts the production of other valuable co-products. Developing a new selective process for propene synthesis from propane aims to replace conventional PDH for industrial needs. The CO2-PDH mechanism involves complex pathways including non-oxidative dehydrogenation and redox reactions facilitated by chromium species. Silica, particularly with ordered mesoporous structures, is a suitable support for chromium dispersion. Beta zeolite, with its unique three-dimensional structure and high surface area, is chosen for its suitability in propene synthesis processes.

丙烯需求预计将以每年约5%的增长率增长，到2023年将达到大约13亿吨。通过优化现有过程增加丙烯产量会负面影响其他重要副产品的生产。开发一种新的选择性过程，从丙烷中合成丙烯，以替代目前工业使用的PDH过程。CO2-PDH机制涉及复杂的路径，包括非氧化脱氢和由铬物种促进的氧化脱氢途径。具有有序介孔结构的硅酸盐是铬分散的理想载体。由于其独特的三维结构和高表面积，β沸石被选为适合丙烯合成过程的原因。β沸石具有其特有的三维结构和高表面面积，适合在丙烯合成过程中使用。
