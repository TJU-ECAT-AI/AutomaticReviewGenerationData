[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."
[2] "Attempts at increasing pro- pene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these pro- cesses, will negatively influence the production of other important co- products."
[3] "One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehy- drogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs."
[4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the limitations in steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes, which produce propene as a co-product. Increasing propene production through optimization negatively impacts the production of other valuable products. There is a significant demand for propylene, estimated to reach 130 million tonnes by 2023, which surpasses the capacity of current methods. 

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, including higher conversion rates of propane and propene yield compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation. It also offers potential for chemical CO2 utilization, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as main products. However, ODHP faces challenges related to reversibility and endothermic nature of the process. The use of oxygen as an oxidant is critical, but its selection requires careful consideration to balance propene production efficiency and process feasibility.

3. In the context of ODHP, using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an additional reactant shows promise in enhancing propene formation rates. When operating in a switch mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, propene formation rate increases notably over chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, indicating the effectiveness of CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation. Conversely, over chromium-containing alumina (AlBeta) catalysts, CO2 addition exhibits a negative effect on propene formation rate, highlighting the importance of support type in the catalytic performance.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程的局限性，这些过程将丙烯作为副产品产生。通过优化这些过程的条件来增加丙烯产量会负面影响其他重要产品的生产。预计到2023年，全球对丙烯的需求将达到1.3亿吨，这超过了当前方法的能力。

2. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）具有多个优势，包括与商业非氧化脱氢相比更高的丙烷和丙烯转化率。它还提供了化学CO2利用的可能性，生产氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）作为主要产品。然而，ODHP面临可逆性和吸热性质的过程挑战。选择氧气作为氧化剂需要仔细考虑，以平衡丙烯生产效率和工艺可行性。

3. 在使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为辅助反应物的丙烷脱氢过程中，显示出增强丙烯形成速率的潜力。在切换模式下操作，即在有和无CO2之间进行丙烷脱氢时，丙烯形成速率在含铬Beta沸石催化剂上显著提高，表明了CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的有效性。相反，在含铬氧化铝（AlBeta）催化剂上，CO2的添加对丙烯形成速率产生了负面效果，强调了支持类型在催化性能中的重要性。
