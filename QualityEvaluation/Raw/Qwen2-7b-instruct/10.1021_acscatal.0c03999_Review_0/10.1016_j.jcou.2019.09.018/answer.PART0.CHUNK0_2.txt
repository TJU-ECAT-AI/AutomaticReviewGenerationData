[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry."
[2] "The demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses."
[3] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."
[4] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."
[5] "One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs."
[6] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[7] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."
[8] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[9] "High dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[10] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."
[11] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect while in the case of active carbon an application in CO2-PDH is limited by period regeneration with air."
[12] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[13] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the decrease in production of other valuable products when attempting to increase propene output. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a selective process for propene synthesis, potentially replacing traditional propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. This method often results in higher per-pass conversion rates of propane and propene yields compared to conventional non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Moreover, ODHP offers a favorable route for chemical CO2 utilization, producing additional hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as main products alongside propene.

2. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, especially those supported on silica with an ordered mesoporous structure, are considered highly promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. High dispersion of chromium species and the presence of redox chromium sites are essential factors for achieving optimal catalytic performance in this process. Additionally, the use of γ-Al2O3 as a support for chromium oxide catalysts leads to a poisoning effect upon CO2 addition, whereas active carbon is limited for CO2-PDH applications due to periodic regeneration requirements with air.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于，试图增加丙烯产量时，会对其他重要副产品的生产产生负面影响。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，提供一种选择性合成丙烯的过程，可能替代当前用于工业需求的丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程。这种方法往往能够提供比常规非氧化脱氢化更高的每道次转化率和丙烯产率。此外，ODHP为化学CO2利用提供了有利途径，除丙烯外，还产生氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）作为主要产品。

2. 铬氧化物基催化剂，特别是那些在有序介孔结构的硅上负载的催化剂，被认为是CO2-PDH中非常有前景的选择，因其高活性和选择性。实现最佳催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的高分散性和红氧化铬位点的存在。γ-Al2O3作为铬氧化物催化剂的载体会导致CO2添加的中毒效应，而活性碳在CO2-PDH应用中的限制在于需要周期性的空气再生。
