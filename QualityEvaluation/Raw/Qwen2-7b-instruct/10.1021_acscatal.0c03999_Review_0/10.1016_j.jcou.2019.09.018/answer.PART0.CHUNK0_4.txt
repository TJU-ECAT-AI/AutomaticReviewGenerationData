[1] "Nowadays unsaturated hydrocarbons are basic and most important intermediates for chemical industry."
[2] "The demand for propene has been growing since it has found an assured position on the chemical raw material and monomers market due to its numerous uses."
[3] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."
[4] "Attempts at increasing propene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these processes, will negatively influence the production of other important co-products."
[5] "One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehydrogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs."
[6] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[7] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."
[8] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[9] "In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:
1. Increasing demand for propene with a projected growth rate of about 5% annually, reaching approximately 130 million tonnes by 2023.
2. Negative effects on the production of other valuable co-products when attempting to increase propene production through process optimization.
3. The need for a more selective process that can produce propene from propane specifically, replacing the current PDH process used industrially.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher per-pass conversion rates of propane and propene yields compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Additionally, it presents potential for chemical CO2 utilization, producing not only propene but also hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as main products. Chromium oxide-based materials, particularly those incorporated into Beta zeolites, are considered promising catalysts for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：
1. 随着每年约5%的增长率，对丙烯的需求持续增长，预计到2023年将达到大约1.3亿吨。
2. 尝试通过优化过程条件增加丙烯产量时，会对其他重要共产品的生产产生负面影响。
3. 需要一种更选择性的过程，专门从丙烷中生产丙烯，以替代目前用于工业需求的PDH过程。

氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供与非氧化性脱氢相比更高的每道次丙烷和丙烯产率来解决这些问题。此外，它还为化学CO2利用提供了可能，除了产生丙烯外，还能产生氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）作为主要产品。由于其高活性和选择性，特别是将铬氧化物融入Beta沸石中的材料被认为是CO2-PDH有前景的催化剂。
