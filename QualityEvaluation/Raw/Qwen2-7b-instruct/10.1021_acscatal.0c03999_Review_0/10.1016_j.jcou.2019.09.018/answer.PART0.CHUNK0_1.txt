<p>Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023.</p>
<p>Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity.</p>
<p>Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation.</p>
<p>The well correlation between the number of redox Cr sites and propene yield up to 2 wt % of Cr has been determined.</p>
<p>Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties.</p>
<p>Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>In this work Cr-containing Beta zeolites were investigated as a catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.</p>

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the limitations in increasing propylene production without reducing the production of valuable co-products. This issue is addressed by oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) which aims to produce propylene selectively, bypassing the need for co-products. ODHP presents advantages in high propane conversion and propene yield compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, it faces limitations related to the selection of oxidants, specifically the use of oxygen, which requires careful consideration to avoid negative impacts on the process efficiency and product purity. The specific challenge associated with using oxygen involves balancing the oxidative pathway to achieve high propene yield without compromising the integrity of the process or product quality.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战是如何在不减少其他有价值副产品产量的情况下增加丙烯产量。这通过选择性氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）过程解决，该过程旨在仅生产丙烯，而无需副产品。与非氧化脱氢相比，ODHP具有高丙烷转化率和丙烯产率的优势。然而，在选择氧化剂时面临局限，特别是使用氧气，需要仔细考虑以避免对过程效率和产品质量产生负面影响。使用氧气的具体挑战是平衡氧化途径以实现高丙烯产率，同时不损害过程或产品质量。
