[1] "Worldwide demand for propene currently reaches 90 million tonnes per year and at an estimated growth rate of about 5 % annually, will reach a value of around 130 million tonnes by 2023."
[2] "Attempts at increasing pro- pene production, e.g. through optimisation of conditions of these pro- cesses, will negatively influence the production of other important co- products."
[3] "One of the crucial research directions is the development of a new selective process of obtaining propene from propane that could replace propane dehy- drogenation process (PDH) currently used for industrial needs."
[4] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[5] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta zeolite catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include the limitations in steam cracking and catalytic cracking processes, which produce propene as a co-product. Increasing propene production through optimization negatively impacts the production of other valuable products. There is a significant demand for propylene, estimated to reach 130 million tonnes by 2023, which surpasses the capacity of current methods. 

2. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) presents several advantages, including higher conversion rates of propane and propene yield compared to commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation. It also offers potential for chemical CO2 utilization, producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as main products. However, ODHP faces challenges related to reversibility and endothermic nature of the process. The use of oxygen as an oxidant is critical, but its selection requires careful consideration to balance propene production efficiency and process feasibility.

3. In the context of ODHP, using carbon dioxide (CO2) as an additional reactant shows promise in enhancing propene formation rates. When operating in a switch mode between propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2, propene formation rate increases notably over chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, indicating the effectiveness of CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation. Conversely, over chromium-containing alumina (AlBeta) catalysts, CO2 addition exhibits a negative effect on propene formation rate, highlighting the importance of support type in the catalytic performance.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括蒸汽裂解和催化裂解过程的局限性，这些过程将丙烯作为副产品产生。通过优化这些过程的条件来增加丙烯产量会负面影响其他重要产品的生产。预计到2023年，全球对丙烯的需求将达到1.3亿吨，这超过了当前方法的能力。

2. 丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）具有多个优势，包括与商业非氧化脱氢相比更高的丙烷和丙烯转化率。它还提供了化学CO2利用的可能性，生产氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）作为主要产品。然而，ODHP面临可逆性和吸热性质的过程挑战。选择氧气作为氧化剂需要仔细考虑，以平衡丙烯生产效率和工艺可行性。

3. 在使用二氧化碳（CO2）作为辅助反应物的丙烷脱氢过程中，显示出增强丙烯形成速率的潜力。在切换模式下操作，即在有和无CO2之间进行丙烷脱氢时，丙烯形成速率在含铬Beta沸石催化剂上显著提高，表明了CO2辅助丙烷脱氢的有效性。相反，在含铬氧化铝（AlBeta）催化剂上，CO2的添加对丙烯形成速率产生了负面效果，强调了支持类型在催化性能中的重要性。

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods are the limitations in increasing propylene production without reducing the production of valuable co-products. This issue is addressed by oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) which aims to produce propylene selectively, bypassing the need for co-products. ODHP presents advantages in high propane conversion and propene yield compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. However, it faces limitations related to the selection of oxidants, specifically the use of oxygen, which requires careful consideration to avoid negative impacts on the process efficiency and product purity. The specific challenge associated with using oxygen involves balancing the oxidative pathway to achieve high propene yield without compromising the integrity of the process or product quality.

1. The primary challenges in current propylene production methods involve the decrease in production of other valuable products when attempting to increase propene output. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by providing a selective process for propene synthesis, potentially replacing traditional propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes. This method often results in higher per-pass conversion rates of propane and propene yields compared to conventional non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Moreover, ODHP offers a favorable route for chemical CO2 utilization, producing additional hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as main products alongside propene.

2. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, especially those supported on silica with an ordered mesoporous structure, are considered highly promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. High dispersion of chromium species and the presence of redox chromium sites are essential factors for achieving optimal catalytic performance in this process. Additionally, the use of γ-Al2O3 as a support for chromium oxide catalysts leads to a poisoning effect upon CO2 addition, whereas active carbon is limited for CO2-PDH applications due to periodic regeneration requirements with air.

1. 当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战在于，试图增加丙烯产量时，会对其他重要副产品的生产产生负面影响。通过氧化丙烷脱氢（ODHP）可以解决这些问题，提供一种选择性合成丙烯的过程，可能替代当前用于工业需求的丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程。这种方法往往能够提供比常规非氧化脱氢化更高的每道次转化率和丙烯产率。此外，ODHP为化学CO2利用提供了有利途径，除丙烯外，还产生氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）作为主要产品。

2. 铬氧化物基催化剂，特别是那些在有序介孔结构的硅上负载的催化剂，被认为是CO2-PDH中非常有前景的选择，因其高活性和选择性。实现最佳催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的高分散性和红氧化铬位点的存在。γ-Al2O3作为铬氧化物催化剂的载体会导致CO2添加的中毒效应，而活性碳在CO2-PDH应用中的限制在于需要周期性的空气再生。

[5] "From above reasons chromium is typically dispersed on a support. Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."
[6] "Beta zeolite was applied due to a three-dimensional structure, the pores larger than those of ZSM-5 with 12-membered ring openings (0.75 by 0.57 nm for linear and 0.65 by 0.56 nm for tortuous channels), a high thermal and acid stability and a large specific surface area needed for high chromium species dispersion."

Propene demand is expected to grow significantly, reaching approximately 130 million tonnes by 2023. Increasing propene production through optimizing existing processes negatively impacts the production of other valuable co-products. Developing a new selective process for propene synthesis from propane aims to replace conventional PDH for industrial needs. The CO2-PDH mechanism involves complex pathways including non-oxidative dehydrogenation and redox reactions facilitated by chromium species. Silica, particularly with ordered mesoporous structures, is a suitable support for chromium dispersion. Beta zeolite, with its unique three-dimensional structure and high surface area, is chosen for its suitability in propene synthesis processes.

The primary challenges in current propylene production methods include:
1. Increasing demand for propene with a projected growth rate of about 5% annually, reaching approximately 130 million tonnes by 2023.
2. Negative effects on the production of other valuable co-products when attempting to increase propene production through process optimization.
3. The need for a more selective process that can produce propene from propane specifically, replacing the current PDH process used industrially.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) addresses these issues by offering higher per-pass conversion rates of propane and propene yields compared to non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Additionally, it presents potential for chemical CO2 utilization, producing not only propene but also hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) as main products. Chromium oxide-based materials, particularly those incorporated into Beta zeolites, are considered promising catalysts for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity.

当前丙烯生产方法的主要挑战包括：
1. 随着每年约5%的增长率，对丙烯的需求持续增长，预计到2023年将达到大约1.3亿吨。
2. 尝试通过优化过程条件增加丙烯产量时，会对其他重要共产品的生产产生负面影响。
3. 需要一种更选择性的过程，专门从丙烷中生产丙烯，以替代目前用于工业需求的PDH过程。

氧化性丙烷脱氢（ODHP）通过提供与非氧化性脱氢相比更高的每道次丙烷和丙烯产率来解决这些问题。此外，它还为化学CO2利用提供了可能，除了产生丙烯外，还能产生氢气和一氧化碳（合成气）作为主要产品。由于其高活性和选择性，特别是将铬氧化物融入Beta沸石中的材料被认为是CO2-PDH有前景的催化剂。
