[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated."
[3] "In the case of propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V-atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[4] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[5] "The reduction and catalytic properties of active VOx domains can be significantly affected by the formation of binary dispersed structures."
[6] "Additives (e.g., P, K, Ca, Ni, Cr, Nb, Mg, Au, Zn and Mo), sometimes added in relevant amount with respect to V, modify acidbasic and redox properties of supported vanadium oxide."
[7] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane."
[8] "In alumina-supported samples, alumina contributes to the primary deep oxidation and dehydrogenation routes of ethane to COx and coke respectively, which proceed effectively over the acidic centers."
[9] "The presence of alkali (Cs, K, Li) affects the structure of MoOx domains and influences their electronic and catalytic properties."
[10] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[11] "Catalytic systems reported in the literature for the period 2000-2006 and giving alkane conversion higher than 10% have been included."
[12] "Systems operating in millisecond-contact-time reactors have not been reported."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Agglomeration of metal cations (from isolated units to bulk metal oxide).
2. Acid-base characteristics of the catalyst.
3. Valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions.
4. Collective electronic properties of the solid.
5. Structural defects, degree of crystallinity, and interactions with the support.

Various regeneration methods for metal oxide catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Reoxidation with O2 is generally the most effective in restoring catalyst activity, though it requires higher temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially preserving more of the catalyst's active surface area.

Answer: The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the agglomeration of metal cations, acid-base characteristics, valence state of the metal cation, collective electronic properties of the solid, and interactions with the support. Regeneration methods include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, with O2 being the most effective but requiring higher temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation, preserving more of the catalyst's active surface area.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括：

1. 铁离子团簇的聚集（从孤立单位到整体金属氧化物）。
2. 催化剂的酸碱特性。
3. 反应条件下金属离子的价态。
4. 固体的集体电子性质。
5. 结构缺陷、结晶度和与支持物的相互作用。

金属氧化物催化剂的再生方法包括氧气、CO2或O2的再氧化。其中，使用氧气进行再氧化通常最有效，但需要更高的温度。CO2添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化，从而保存更多催化剂的活性表面区域。
