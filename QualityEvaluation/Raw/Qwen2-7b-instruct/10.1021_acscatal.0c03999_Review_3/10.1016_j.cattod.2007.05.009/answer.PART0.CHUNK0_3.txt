[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[4] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[5] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[6] "In the case of propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[7] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[8] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[9] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[10] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41 [49,100,106111], MCM-48 [112] or SBA-15 [112115]."
[11] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[12] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve the formation of crystallites and the loss of accessibility caused by the formation of MoO3 crystallites. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the catalyst's activity. Reoxidation with air is effective but requires higher temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially improving catalytic performance without the need for high temperatures.

Answer: The main causes of deactivation in Cr-based and VOx catalysts are the formation of crystallites and loss of accessibility. Air reoxidation is a common method but requires higher temperatures. CO2 addition can help reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially enhancing performance.
