[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acid-base characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[2] "The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."
[3] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181,187,189,263-269]."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve the loss of active sites due to agglomeration and the change in the valence state of metal cations under reaction conditions. The degree of agglomeration, acid-base characteristics, and the valence state of metal cations are crucial factors affecting catalyst performance. 

Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have varying effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation generally requires higher temperatures and may not efficiently remove all forms of deactivation, whereas CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by acting as a reducing agent, potentially restoring active sites. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst and the type of deactivation.

Combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, have improved the exploration of new catalytic systems. These methods enable the preparation and study of a larger number of systems, facilitating the discovery of catalysts with enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The use of less conventional oxidants like N2O and CO2 offers opportunities for significant advancements in this field by generating reactive oxygen species with specific reactivity towards hydrocarbons and enabling in situ control over active phase properties.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是活性位点的丢失，尤其是由于簇集和反应条件下金属离子价态的变化。簇集程度、酸碱特性以及金属离子的价态是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。

再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，其有效性、所需温度及对催化性能的影响各不相同。空气再氧化通常需要较高的温度，并且可能不能有效去除所有形式的失活，而CO2的添加可以减少VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过作为还原剂的作用，可能恢复活性位点。这些方法的有效性取决于特定催化剂和失活类型。

组合/并行系统，包括遗传算法和进化催化剂选择方法，极大地改善了新催化系统的制备和研究，为发现具有增强性能的氧化脱氢过程催化剂做出了重要贡献。这些方法使更多系统得到准备和研究，有助于发现新的催化剂。使用诸如N2O和CO2等不太常规的氧化剂提供了显著的进展机会，通过生成具有特定烃反应性的活性氧物种，并实现活性相属性的原位控制。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are often attributed to the formation of by-products and the development of surface passivation layers. In the context of Cr-based catalysts, deactivation can occur due to the formation of chromium oxides or salts, which can lead to a loss of active sites. For VOx catalysts, deactivation might involve the formation of polymers or aggregates, which reduce the accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

Various regeneration methods aim to restore the catalytic activity by removing by-products or reactivating the surface. Reoxidation with air or O2 is a common approach that can efficiently regenerate catalysts, but it requires higher temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively removing oxygen species without excessively reducing the active sites, offering a more selective regeneration route.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因通常归因于副产物的形成和表面钝化层的发展。对于Cr基催化剂，失效可能由于铬氧化物或盐的形成导致活性位点损失。对于VOx催化剂，失活可能涉及聚合物或聚集物的形成，这会降低反应物到达活性位点的可及性。

各种再生方法旨在通过去除副产物或重新激活表面来恢复催化活性。空气或O2的再氧化是一种常见的再生方法，但需要更高的温度。CO2添加可以避免在VOx催化反应中过度氧化，通过选择性地去除氧物种而不过度减少活性位点，提供更选择性的再生途径。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include:

1. Agglomeration of metal cations (from isolated units to bulk metal oxide).
2. Acid-base characteristics of the catalyst.
3. Valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions.
4. Collective electronic properties of the solid.
5. Structural defects, degree of crystallinity, and interactions with the support.

Various regeneration methods for metal oxide catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Reoxidation with O2 is generally the most effective in restoring catalyst activity, though it requires higher temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially preserving more of the catalyst's active surface area.

[1] "The demand for olefins, especially ethylene and propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these processes are widely used, an intense research activity is taking place to develop catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation(ODH)ofalkanes,duetothefollowingreasons:"
[3] "However, in the case of alkenes produced from alkanes, the lower cost of the feedstock is not a real incentive, since current commercial technologies for olefin production already use fuel-grade feedstocks."
[4] "In this case, conversely, the improved energy efficiency (ODH is exothermal, while dehydrogenation and cracking are endothermal), and process simplicity are effective incentives."
[5] "Furthermore, Lange [3] underlined that more exothermal reactions imply higher energy losses (i.e., the difference between the combustion heat of feed and that of the product) and, hence, higher fixed costs, especially if the production of CO2, the main by-product in alkane ODH, is taken into account."
[6] "In the case of propane ODH, the catalytic activity of vanadium oxide catalysts increases with the V2O5 loading, while rates per V- atom reach a maximum on VOx domains of intermediate size, providing a balance between the activity of surface VOx species and their accessibility to reactants."
[7] "For both propane and ethane, reactivity data for catalysts made of supported vanadium oxide are consistent both with kinetically relevant steps involving the dissociation of CH bonds (methylenic C atom in propane) and with a Mars-van Krevelen redox mechanism involving lattice oxygen in CH bond activation."
[8] "The extent of V reduction during steady-state ODH is much lower than for stoichiometric reduction of V5+ to V4+ or V3+."
[9] "The role of the support on the reactivity of vanadium oxide in alkane ODH has been investigated by many authors."
[10] "Examples include V-containing high-surface siliceous materials, such as MCM-41 [49,100,106111], MCM-48 [112] or SBA-15 [112115]."
[11] "In the case of VCoAPO-18, the presence of both acid sites (related to the presence of Co2+ cations) and redox sites (related to the presence of V5+/4+ and Co3+/2+) seems to be an important factor in achieving high selectivities to ethylene during the ODH of ethane [116]."
[12] "One of the best performing catalysts in propane ODH is the VOx-SBA-15 system [113,115], prepared by an alcoholic impregnation method, in which the introduction of V species onto the inner walls of SBA-15 provides a system with a large concentration of accessible, isolated and structurally well-defined active sites."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve the formation of crystallites and the loss of accessibility caused by the formation of MoO3 crystallites. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the catalyst's activity. Reoxidation with air is effective but requires higher temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially improving catalytic performance without the need for high temperatures.

Answer: The main causes of deactivation in Cr-based and VOx catalysts are the formation of crystallites and loss of accessibility. Air reoxidation is a common method but requires higher temperatures.
