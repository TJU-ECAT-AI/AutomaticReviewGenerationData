[1] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."
[2] "In the case of ethane ODH, most catalysts reported in literature give ethylene yields lower than 20%."
[3] "Catalytic systems reported in the literature for the period 2000-2006 and giving alkane conversion higher than 10% have been included."

There are no specific quotes addressing the causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the effectiveness of different regeneration methods, or the impact of CO2 addition on VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, the document discusses the catalytic properties of vanadium oxide (VOx) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane.

文献中没有直接针对氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的原因、不同再生方法的有效性，以及CO2添加对VOx催化反应的影响的具体引用。然而，文档讨论了在乙烯和丙烯氧化脱氢中的钒氧化物（VOx）和钼氧化物（MoOx）催化剂的催化性质。
