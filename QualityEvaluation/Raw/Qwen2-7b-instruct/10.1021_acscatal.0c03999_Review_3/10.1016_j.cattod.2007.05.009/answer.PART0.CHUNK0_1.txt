[1] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are often attributed to the formation of by-products and the development of surface passivation layers. In the context of Cr-based catalysts, deactivation can occur due to the formation of chromium oxides or salts, which can lead to a loss of active sites. For VOx catalysts, deactivation might involve the formation of polymers or aggregates, which reduce the accessibility of reactants to the active sites.

Various regeneration methods aim to restore the catalytic activity by removing by-products or reactivating the surface. Reoxidation with air or O2 is a common approach that can efficiently regenerate catalysts, but it requires higher temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively removing oxygen species without excessively reducing the active sites, offering a more selective regeneration route.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因通常归因于副产物的形成和表面钝化层的发展。对于Cr基催化剂，失效可能由于铬氧化物或盐的形成导致活性位点损失。对于VOx催化剂，失活可能涉及聚合物或聚集物的形成，这会降低反应物到达活性位点的可及性。

各种再生方法旨在通过去除副产物或重新激活表面来恢复催化活性。空气或O2的再氧化是一种常见的再生方法，但需要更高的温度。CO2添加可以避免在VOx催化反应中过度氧化，通过选择性地去除氧物种而不过度减少活性位点，提供更选择性的再生途径。
