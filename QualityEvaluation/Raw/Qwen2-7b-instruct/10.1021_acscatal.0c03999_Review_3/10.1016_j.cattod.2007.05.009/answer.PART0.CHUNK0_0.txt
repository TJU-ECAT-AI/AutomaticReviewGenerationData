[1] "The majority of papers focus on some specific aspects that may affect the reactivity of the catalysts investigated. For instance, in the case of supported metal oxide catalysts, in addition to the usual morphological aspects, some of the important features affecting the performance are: the degree of agglomeration of Me cations (from isolated units to bulk Me oxide); acid-base characteristics; the valence state of the metal cation under reaction conditions; the collective electronic properties of the solid."
[2] "The use of less conventional oxidants, i.e., N2O [34] and CO2, may lead to significant breakthroughs in this field, due to the possibility of either generating peculiar O species with specific reactivity to the hydrocarbon, or carrying out an in situ control on the active phase properties."
[3] "In recent years, the use of combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithm and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, has considerably improved the number of catalytic systems that can be prepared and studied, thus making an important contribution to the discovery of new catalytic systems [181,187,189,263-269]."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve the loss of active sites due to agglomeration and the change in the valence state of metal cations under reaction conditions. The degree of agglomeration, acid-base characteristics, and the valence state of metal cations are crucial factors affecting catalyst performance. 

Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have varying effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation generally requires higher temperatures and may not efficiently remove all forms of deactivation, whereas CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by acting as a reducing agent, potentially restoring active sites. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst and the type of deactivation.

Combinatorial/parallel systems, including genetic algorithms and evolutionary catalyst selection approaches, have improved the exploration of new catalytic systems. These methods enable the preparation and study of a larger number of systems, facilitating the discovery of catalysts with enhanced performance in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The use of less conventional oxidants like N2O and CO2 offers opportunities for significant advancements in this field by generating reactive oxygen species with specific reactivity towards hydrocarbons and enabling in situ control over active phase properties.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是活性位点的丢失，尤其是由于簇集和反应条件下金属离子价态的变化。簇集程度、酸碱特性以及金属离子的价态是影响催化剂性能的关键因素。

再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，其有效性、所需温度及对催化性能的影响各不相同。空气再氧化通常需要较高的温度，并且可能不能有效去除所有形式的失活，而CO2的添加可以减少VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过作为还原剂的作用，可能恢复活性位点。这些方法的有效性取决于特定催化剂和失活类型。

组合/并行系统，包括遗传算法和进化催化剂选择方法，极大地改善了新催化系统的制备和研究，为发现具有增强性能的氧化脱氢过程催化剂做出了重要贡献。这些方法使更多系统得到准备和研究，有助于发现新的催化剂。使用诸如N2O和CO2等不太常规的氧化剂提供了显著的进展机会，通过生成具有特定烃反应性的活性氧物种，并实现活性相属性的原位控制。
