<p>Propane is physisorbed parallel to the surface with the difference in the preference between propane positioned along or across the [100] direction being only marginal.</p>
<p>The preferred location for propane physisorption is over the valley, where the propane molecule is allowed to come closer to the surface.

<p>As seen from Fig. 2, representative physisorbed states of propane over the unsupported and supported vanadia surface are depicted, while their respective physisorption energies are reported in the first and third rows of Table 1.</p>
<p>In the first step of propane chemisorption via CAC bond activation (1 ? 4 in Fig. 3), a lattice oxygen attacks the CAC bond of propane, forming an adsorbed methoxide and a physisorbed ethyl radical. Based on the activation energies of Table 3, most favourable sites for this step on either catalyst are O(1) and O(2), while O(3) is the least reactive one.</p>
<p>Starting from physisorbed propane, two different pathways have been envisaged for propanal/acetone formation. The first path (i.e. path I) can be described as a sequence of the following steps (see Fig. 7): hydrogen abstraction from propane (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b), chemisorption of the propyl radical on a free lattice oxygen (3a ? 7a, 3b ? 7b), alpha hydrogen abstraction from the propoxide intermediate (7a ? 10a, 7b ? 10b) and desorption of propanal/acetone (10a ? 11a, 10b ? 11b).</p>
<p>Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the unsupported and supported vanadia surface.</p>

1. Propane prefers physisorption parallel to the surface, with little difference between orientations along or across the [100] direction. Over the valley, the propane molecule can come closer to the surface, though this preference is less pronounced on the supported vanadia surface due to the tilted vanadyl groups, making the surface more flat with less distinct valley regions.

2. Propane's physisorption energies are reported in the first row of Table 1 for the unsupported vanadia surface and the third row for the supported vanadia surface. Propane's physisorption states and energies are depicted in Fig. 2.

3. In the CAC bond activation step, a lattice oxygen attacks the CAC bond of propane, forming an adsorbed methoxide and a physisorbed ethyl radical. The most favorable sites for this step are O(1) and O(2) on both catalysts, while O(3) is the least reactive.

4. The first pathway for propanal/acetone formation starts with hydrogen abstraction from propane, followed by chemisorption of the propyl radical on a free lattice oxygen, alpha hydrogen abstraction from the propoxide intermediate, and finally desorption of propanal/acetone.

5. The O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on both the unsupported and supported vanadia surfaces.

1. 丙烷倾向于平行吸附于表面，沿或跨[100]方向的方向之间的偏好差异很小。在山谷处，丙烷分子可以更接近表面，尽管在支持的钒氧化物表面上，由于倾斜的钒氧基团的存在，这种偏好更加不明显，使表面更加平坦，谷区域也更不明显。

2. 表1的第一行报告了未支持的钒氧化物表面的丙烷物理吸附能，第三行为支持的钒氧化物表面的丙烷物理吸附能。丙烷的物理吸附状态和能量在图2中表示。

3. 在CAC键激活步骤中，一个晶格氧攻击丙烷的CAC键，形成一个吸附的甲醇和一个乙烯基自由基。这个步骤在两种催化剂上最有利的位点是O(1)和O(2)，而O(3)是最不活跃的。

4. 丙烷脱氢生成丙酮/丙醇的第一步路径始于从丙烷的氢原子提取，然后是丙基自由基在自由晶格氧上的化学吸附，接着是从丙醇中间体的α氢原子提取，最后是丙酮/丙醇的脱附。

5. O(1)钒氧基是未支持和支撑的钒氧化物表面上最活跃的位点。
