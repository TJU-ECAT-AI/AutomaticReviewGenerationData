[1] "Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the unsupported and supported vanadia surface."
[2] "Propane oxidation to i-propanol or acetone and propane dehydrogenation are equally favourable on the unsupported catalyst, since they share the same potentially rate-limiting step, that is, the initial H abstraction (1 ? 3b), with an energy barrier of 120 kJ/mol."
[3] "On the other hand,over the supported catalyst, propane dehydrogenation can be expected to be the dominant reaction path."
[4] "Therefore, propene can be expected to be the only product of propane selective oxidation over the supported catalyst, while both propene and oxygenates (i.e. i-propanol and acetone) can be expected as products of propane selective oxidation over the unsupported catalyst, which is in agreement with the experimental observations on these catalysts [69,70]."
[5] "Nevertheless, the two catalysts share some common features. In both cases, the potentially rate-limiting step of propane oxidation is the secondary CAH bond activation of propane via a direct H abstraction (1 ? 3b), which is in agreement with experiment [2,7173]."

1. The most active site on both the unsupported and supported vanadia surface is the vanadyl oxygen (O(1)) site.
2. On the unsupported catalyst, the pathways of propane oxidation leading to i-propanol or acetone and propane dehydrogenation are equally favorable due to sharing the same rate-limiting step of initial H abstraction with an energy barrier of 120 kJ/mol.
3. Over the supported catalyst, propane dehydrogenation is predicted to be the dominant reaction pathway.
4. The supported catalyst is anticipated to produce only propene, whereas the unsupported catalyst can yield both propene and oxygenates (i-propanol and acetone), aligning with experimental findings.
5. Both catalysts exhibit common features in that the rate-limiting step for propane oxidation involves direct H abstraction from the secondary CAH bond, in accordance with experimental evidence.

1. 支撑在V2O5表面的最活跃位点是V(1)氧位。
2. 对于未支撑催化剂，从异丙醇或乙酸酯形成和丙烷脱氢化两条路径的竞争性反应中，由于共享相同的限速步骤（初始氢抽象），即1?3b，能量壁垒为120 kJ/mol，这两条路径具有同等的可能性。
3. 在支持催化剂上，预期丙烷脱氢化将是主导的反应路径。
4. 预计支持催化剂仅产生丙烯，而未支撑催化剂可以同时生成丙烯和氧产物（异丙醇和乙酸酯），这与实验结果一致。
5. 两种催化剂都表现出共同特征：丙烷氧化的速率限制步骤涉及从二级CAH键直接氢抽象，这与实验结果相符。
