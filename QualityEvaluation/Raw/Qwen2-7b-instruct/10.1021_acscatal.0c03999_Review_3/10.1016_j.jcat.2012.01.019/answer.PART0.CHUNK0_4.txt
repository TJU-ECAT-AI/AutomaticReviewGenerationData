[1] "Heterogeneous catalysts composed of transition metal oxides are commonly used for the oxidation of hydrocarbons."
[2] "The interest in this reaction stems from the fact that the currently applied non-oxida- tive dehydrogenation is an endothermic and therefore energy intensive process, suffering from low propene yields due to cata- lyst coking and methane formation."
[3] "Moreover, as vanadia is commonly used supported on another metal oxide, for example, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, the effect of a strong interac- tion of a TiO2 anatase support with the active vanadia phase on propane activation and oxidation is investigated."
[4] "As seen from Fig. 1, this model is a (1  2) super- cell of (001) V2O5, which corresponds to a surface area of 0.83 nm2 (i.e. 1165.8 pm  715.1 pm) and a propane coverage of 1/8 ML (i.e. one propane molecule per eight surface vanadium atoms)."
[5] "Moreover, it is worth mentioning that no decomposition pathways such as a- or b-elimination are available after the formation of a CAV bond [16], the chemisorption of the propyl radical on a vanadium atom (3a ? 5a, 3b ? 5b) can be excluded from the reaction network of propane selective oxidation over vanadia."
[6] "Based on a comparison between the highest energy barriers found for the reaction paths considered (see Tables S6 and 3), the most reactive site of the unsupported catalyst is the O(1) vanadyl site, with i-propanol formation being more favourable than n-propanol formation on this site."
[7] "On the other hand, in the case of the supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanol is hindered mostly by the second H abstraction step (7a ? 10a,7b ? 10b)."
[8] "Therefore, based on a comparison between the highest energy barriers found for the reaction paths considered (see Tables S8 and 3), propene formation via an adsorbed propoxide intermediate (path II or III) is less favourable than propene formation directly from the propyl radical (path I), that is,without chemisorption of the propyl radical (3a ? 6a, 3a ? 7a,3b ? 6b, 3b ? 7b)."

1. Transition metal oxides serve as common catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation.
2. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation is endothermic and energy-intensive, resulting in low propene yields due to catalyst deactivation and methane formation.
3. The effect of a strong interaction between TiO2 anatase support and the active vanadia phase on propane activation and oxidation is explored.
4. The model is a (1  2) supercell of (001) V2O5 with a surface area of 0.83 nm2 and a propane coverage of 1/8 ML.
5. Decomposition pathways are unavailable after a CAV bond is formed, thus excluding chemisorption of the propyl radical on a vanadium atom from the reaction network.
6. The O(1) vanadyl site is the most reactive for unsupported catalysts, favoring i-propanol formation over n-propanol.
7. Propane oxidation to propanol over the supported catalyst is primarily hindered by the second H abstraction step.
8. Propene formation via an adsorbed propoxide intermediate is less favorable than direct formation from the propyl radical for the supported catalyst.

1. 过渡金属氧化物通常用作烃氧化的催化剂。
2. 非氧化脱氢反应是吸热的且能耗高，导致丙烯产量低，催化剂结焦和甲烷形成。
3. 探究了TiO2锐钛矿支持下活性二氧化钒相之间的强相互作用对丙烷活化和氧化的影响。
4. 模型为(1  2)超晶胞的(001) V2O5，具有0.83 nm2的表面积和1/8 ML的丙烷覆盖度。
5. 形成CAV键后不存在分解途径，因此排除了丙基自由基在钒原子上的化学吸附。
6. 对于未支持的催化剂，O(1)钒氧位是最活跃的，有利于异丙醇的生成而非正丙醇。
7. 支持的催化剂上丙烷氧化至丙醇主要被第二次氢解离步骤阻碍。
8. 对于支持的催化剂，通过吸附的丙醇中间体形成丙烯不如直接从丙基自由基形成丙烯有利。
