<EnglishVersionAnswer>
There are no specific quotes provided regarding the causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, regeneration methods, or their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The document focuses on the selective oxidation of propane over V2O5 and V2O5/TiO2 catalysts using DFT calculations. It discusses the reaction mechanisms, activation energies, and selectivities, but does not delve into the regeneration of metal oxide catalysts.

<quotes>
<p>Propane is physisorbed parallel to the surface with the difference in the preference between propane positioned along or across the [100] direction being only marginal.</p>
<p>The preferred location for propane physisorption is over the valley, where the propane molecule is allowed to come closer to the surface. However, this preference in the location for propane physisorption is less pronounced in the supported vanadia surface because of the tilted vanadyl groups (see Fig. 1), which make the surface more flat with less distinct valley regions.</p>
<p>As seen from Fig. 2, representative physisorbed states of propane over the unsupported and supported vanadia surface are depicted, while their respective physisorption energies are reported in the first and third rows of Table 1.</p>
<p>In the first step of propane chemisorption via CAC bond activation (1 ? 4 in Fig. 3), a lattice oxygen attacks the CAC bond of propane, forming an adsorbed methoxide and a physisorbed ethyl radical. Based on the activation energies of Table 3, most favourable sites for this step on either catalyst are O(1) and O(2), while O(3) is the least reactive one.</p>
<p>Starting from physisorbed propane, two different pathways have been envisaged for propanal/acetone formation. The first path (i.e. path I) can be described as a sequence of the following steps (see Fig. 7): hydrogen abstraction from propane (1 ? 3a, 1 ? 3b), chemisorption of the propyl radical on a free lattice oxygen (3a ? 7a, 3b ? 7b), alpha hydrogen abstraction from the propoxide intermediate (7a ? 10a, 7b ? 10b) and desorption of propanal/acetone (10a ? 11a, 10b ? 11b).</p>
<p>Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the unsupported and supported vanadia surface.</p>

1. Propane prefers physisorption parallel to the surface, with little difference between orientations along or across the [100] direction. Over the valley, the propane molecule can come closer to the surface, though this preference is less pronounced on the supported vanadia surface due to the tilted vanadyl groups, making the surface more flat with less distinct valley regions.

2. Propane's physisorption energies are reported in the first row of Table 1 for the unsupported vanadia surface and the third row for the supported vanadia surface. Propane's physisorption states and energies are depicted in Fig. 2.

3. In the CAC bond activation step, a lattice oxygen attacks the CAC bond of propane, forming an adsorbed methoxide and a physisorbed ethyl radical. The most favorable sites for this step are O(1) and O(2) on both catalysts, while O(3) is the least reactive.

4. The first pathway for propanal/acetone formation starts with hydrogen abstraction from propane, followed by chemisorption of the propyl radical on a free lattice oxygen, alpha hydrogen abstraction from the propoxide intermediate, and finally desorption of propanal/acetone.

5. The O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on both the unsupported and supported vanadia surfaces.

1. 丙烷倾向于平行吸附于表面，沿或跨[100]方向的方向之间的偏好差异很小。在山谷处，丙烷分子可以更接近表面，尽管在支持的钒氧化物表面上，由于倾斜的钒氧基团的存在，这种偏好更加不明显，使表面更加平坦，谷区域也更不明显。

2. 表1的第一行报告了未支持的钒氧化物表面的丙烷物理吸附能，第三行为支持的钒氧化物表面的丙烷物理吸附能。丙烷的物理吸附状态和能量在图2中表示。

3. 在CAC键激活步骤中，一个晶格氧攻击丙烷的CAC键，形成一个吸附的甲醇和一个乙烯基自由基。这个步骤在两种催化剂上最有利的位点是O(1)和O(2)，而O(3)是最不活跃的。

4. 丙烷脱氢生成丙酮/丙醇的第一步路径始于从丙烷的氢原子提取，然后是丙基自由基在自由晶格氧上的化学吸附，接着是从丙醇中间体的α氢原子提取，最后是丙酮/丙醇的脱附。

5. O(1)钒氧基是未支持和支撑的钒氧化物表面上最活跃的位点。

[1] "Overall, the O(1) vanadyl site is the most active site on the unsupported and supported vanadia surface."
[2] "Propane oxidation to i-propanol or acetone and propane dehydrogenation are equally favourable on the unsupported catalyst, since they share the same potentially rate-limiting step, that is, the initial H abstraction (1 ? 3b), with an energy barrier of 120 kJ/mol."
[3] "On the other hand,over the supported catalyst, propane dehydrogenation can be expected to be the dominant reaction path."
[4] "Therefore, propene can be expected to be the only product of propane selective oxidation over the supported catalyst, while both propene and oxygenates (i.e. i-propanol and acetone) can be expected as products of propane selective oxidation over the unsupported catalyst, which is in agreement with the experimental observations on these catalysts [69,70]."
[5] "Nevertheless, the two catalysts share some common features. In both cases, the potentially rate-limiting step of propane oxidation is the secondary CAH bond activation of propane via a direct H abstraction (1 ? 3b), which is in agreement with experiment [2,7173]."

1. The most active site on both the unsupported and supported vanadia surface is the vanadyl oxygen (O(1)) site.
2. On the unsupported catalyst, the pathways of propane oxidation leading to i-propanol or acetone and propane dehydrogenation are equally favorable due to sharing the same rate-limiting step of initial H abstraction with an energy barrier of 120 kJ/mol.
3. Over the supported catalyst, propane dehydrogenation is predicted to be the dominant reaction pathway.
4. The supported catalyst is anticipated to produce only propene, whereas the unsupported catalyst can yield both propene and oxygenates (i-propanol and acetone), aligning with experimental findings.
5. Both catalysts exhibit common features in that the rate-limiting step for propane oxidation involves direct H abstraction from the secondary CAH bond, in accordance with experimental evidence.

1. 支撑在V2O5表面的最活跃位点是V(1)氧位。
2. 对于未支撑催化剂，从异丙醇或乙酸酯形成和丙烷脱氢化两条路径的竞争性反应中，由于共享相同的限速步骤（初始氢抽象），即1?3b，能量壁垒为120 kJ/mol，这两条路径具有同等的可能性。
3. 在支持催化剂上，预期丙烷脱氢化将是主导的反应路径。
4. 预计支持催化剂仅产生丙烯，而未支撑催化剂可以同时生成丙烯和氧产物（异丙醇和乙酸酯），这与实验结果一致。
5. 两种催化剂都表现出共同特征：丙烷氧化的速率限制步骤涉及从二级CAH键直接氢抽象，这与实验结果相符。

[1] "Heterogeneous catalysts composed of transition metal oxides are commonly used for the oxidation of hydrocarbons."
[2] "The interest in this reaction stems from the fact that the currently applied non-oxida- tive dehydrogenation is an endothermic and therefore energy intensive process, suffering from low propene yields due to cata- lyst coking and methane formation."
[3] "Moreover, as vanadia is commonly used supported on another metal oxide, for example, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, the effect of a strong interac- tion of a TiO2 anatase support with the active vanadia phase on propane activation and oxidation is investigated."
[4] "As seen from Fig. 1, this model is a (1  2) super- cell of (001) V2O5, which corresponds to a surface area of 0.83 nm2 (i.e. 1165.8 pm  715.1 pm) and a propane coverage of 1/8 ML (i.e. one propane molecule per eight surface vanadium atoms)."
[5] "Moreover, it is worth mentioning that no decomposition pathways such as a- or b-elimination are available after the formation of a CAV bond [16], the chemisorption of the propyl radical on a vanadium atom (3a ? 5a, 3b ? 5b) can be excluded from the reaction network of propane selective oxidation over vanadia."
[6] "Based on a comparison between the highest energy barriers found for the reaction paths considered (see Tables S6 and 3), the most reactive site of the unsupported catalyst is the O(1) vanadyl site, with i-propanol formation being more favourable than n-propanol formation on this site."
[7] "On the other hand, in the case of the supported catalyst, propane oxidation to propanol is hindered mostly by the second H abstraction step (7a ? 10a,7b ? 10b)."
[8] "Therefore, based on a comparison between the highest energy barriers found for the reaction paths considered (see Tables S8 and 3), propene formation via an adsorbed propoxide intermediate (path II or III) is less favourable than propene formation directly from the propyl radical (path I), that is,without chemisorption of the propyl radical (3a ? 6a, 3a ? 7a,3b ? 6b, 3b ? 7b)."

1. Transition metal oxides serve as common catalysts for hydrocarbon oxidation.
2. Non-oxidative dehydrogenation is endothermic and energy-intensive, resulting in low propene yields due to catalyst deactivation and methane formation.
3. The effect of a strong interaction between TiO2 anatase support and the active vanadia phase on propane activation and oxidation is explored.
4. The model is a (1  2) supercell of (001) V2O5 with a surface area of 0.83 nm2 and a propane coverage of 1/8 ML.
5. Decomposition pathways are unavailable after a CAV bond is formed, thus excluding chemisorption of the propyl radical on a vanadium atom from the reaction network.
6. The O(1) vanadyl site is the most reactive for unsupported catalysts, favoring i-propanol formation over n-propanol.
7. Propane oxidation to propanol over the supported catalyst is primarily hindered by the second H abstraction step.
8. Propene formation via an adsorbed propoxide intermediate is less favorable than direct formation from the propyl radical for the supported catalyst.
