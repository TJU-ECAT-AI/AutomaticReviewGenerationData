[1] "Dehydrogenation of propane over different polymorphs of gallium oxide in the presence or absence of CO2 was studied."
[2] "β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest activity among the polymorphs, and it is even more active than chromium oxide catalyst in the presence of CO2."
[3] "TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C."
[4] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway."
[5] "Increasing the reaction temperature facilitates the activation of CO2 over β-Ga2O3."
[6] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."
[7] "The low surface area of β-Ga2O3 probably accounts for the lower amount of coke deposited."
[8] "The initial propane conversion is decreased from 23.3 to 13.6% after H2 pretreatment, but the catalyst becomes more stable."
[9] "After the second and third regeneration, the activity of the catalyst is almost fully recovered."
[10] "About 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C."
[11] "The amount of reducible gallium oxide species in the catalyst is not restored after regeneration."
[12] "The promoting effect of CO2 is relatively less significant, particularly at the initial stage of reaction."
[13] "β-Ga2O3 is probably the most practical polymorphic form for this type of reaction above 550 C."

1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by overoxidation, especially when CO2 is involved. Overoxidation leads to the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, reducing its activity. Various regeneration methods include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Among these, reoxidation with air is generally more effective in restoring catalyst activity, though it may require higher temperatures. CO2 can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction, enhancing catalytic activity and stability.

2. The effectiveness of regeneration methods varies based on their ability to remove carbon deposits and restore active sites. Air reoxidation is typically more successful, but it might necessitate higher temperatures. CO2 regeneration can be less effective, especially at the initial stage of reaction, as it might not fully restore the catalyst's activity. However, CO2 addition can still enhance the reaction by promoting the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions, improving catalytic performance indirectly.

Answer: Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is mainly caused by overoxidation, leading to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness and temperature requirements. Air reoxidation generally restores catalyst activity better, though it may require higher temperatures. CO2 regeneration can mitigate overoxidation but is less effective at the initial stage of reaction. CO2 addition enhances catalytic activity by facilitating reactions like the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard, improving performance indirectly.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的失效主要由过氧化导致，尤其是二氧化碳参与时。过氧化会导致催化剂表面形成碳沉积物，降低活性。不同的再生方法包括空气、二氧化碳或氧气的再氧化。其中，空气再氧化通常更有效于恢复催化剂活性，但可能需要更高的温度。二氧化碳可以间接增强VOx催化反应，通过促进反向水煤气变换反应和布杜瓦德反应，增强活性和稳定性。

2. 各种再生方法的有效性根据它们去除碳沉积物和恢复活性位点的能力而有所不同。空气再氧化通常更成功，但可能需要更高的温度。二氧化碳再生在初始反应阶段的效果可能较小，因为它可能无法完全恢复催化剂的活性。然而，二氧化碳添加仍可通过促进如反向水煤气变换和布杜瓦德反应来增强催化性能，间接提高性能。
