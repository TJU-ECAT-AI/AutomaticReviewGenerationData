[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."
[3] "The regeneration treatment of the β-Ga2O3 catalyst after 6 h of reaction at 500 C in the presence of CO2 was attempted. As shown in Fig. 7, the propane conversion on β-Ga2O3 catalyst decreases from 23.3 to 10.8% after 6 h on stream. The reaction was interrupted under a N2 stream, and then O2 was introduced at 500 C for 1 h to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst. The propane conversion on the regenerated catalyst is 17.0%, which is much lower than the initial conversion, showing that the original activity of the catalyst could not be fully restored."

1. The dehydrogenation reaction is proposed to occur via a heterolytic dissociation pathway. The presence of CO2 enhances this reaction due to the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions.
2. The catalytic activity of CO2 towards β-Ga2O3 is more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.
3. After a 6-hour reaction at 500°C with CO2, the propane conversion on the β-Ga2O3 catalyst drops from 23.3% to 10.8%. Upon regeneration with O2 at 500°C, the propane conversion increases to 17.0%, indicating that the original activity of the catalyst was not fully restored.

1. 脱氢反应通过异裂解反应途径进行，CO2的存在由于逆向水煤气变换反应和布杜瓦反应而增强此反应。
2. CO2对β-Ga2O3催化剂的促进作用在550°C以上更为明显。
3. 在500°C下与CO2反应6小时后，β-Ga2O3催化剂的丙烷转化率从23.3%降至10.8%。在500°C下使用O2进行再生后，丙烷转化率增加到17.0%，表明催化剂的原始活性并未完全恢复。
