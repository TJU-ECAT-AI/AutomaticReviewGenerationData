[1] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C."
[2] "It is more interesting to note that the O2-regenerated β-Ga2O3 catalyst, after 6 h of reaction in the presence of CO2, is not reduced by H2 in TPR measurements, as shown in Fig. 9, indicating that the part of the reducible gallium oxide species in the catalyst is not restored after regeneration."
[3] "TPR and XPS results show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, especially in Cr-based and VOx catalysts. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these methods varies, with reoxidation by O2 typically being the most straightforward and efficient approach. However, the extent to which the catalyst can be restored to its initial activity depends on the specific regeneration method used. For instance, β-Ga2O3 catalysts show a notable reduction in reducible oxide species upon reaction and regeneration, which affects their catalytic performance.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化，尤其是在Cr基和VOx催化剂中。不同的再生方法（如使用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化）在有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。这些方法的有效性各不相同，其中使用O2进行氧化通常是最直接和有效的方法。然而，催化剂恢复到初始活性的程度取决于所使用的具体再生方法。例如，β-Ga2O3催化剂在反应和再生后显示出明显的可还原氧化物物种减少，这影响了它们的催化性能。
