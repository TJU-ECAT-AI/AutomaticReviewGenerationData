[1] "Experimental results at such a low temperature show that the promoting effect of CO2 is relatively less significant, particularly at the initial stage of reaction."
[2] "The propane conversion increases significantly above 550 C, in particular, in the presence of CO2, demonstrating that β-Ga2O3 is probably the most practical polymorphic form for this type of reaction."
[3] "TPR and XPS studies show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. At lower temperatures, the enhancing effect of CO2 on the oxidative dehydrogenation process is less pronounced, especially during the early stages of the reaction. 
2. Increasing the reaction temperature to above 550°C leads to a significant increase in propane conversion, particularly when CO2 is present, suggesting that β-Ga2O3 is likely the most suitable polymorphic form for this type of reaction.
3. About 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C, but this portion of reducible oxide does not recover after reaction and oxygen regeneration.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

[1] "The dehydrogenation reaction is suggested to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway, and it is enhanced by CO2 because of the existence of the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on β-Ga2O3 catalyst is more evident above 550 C."
[3] "The regeneration treatment of the β-Ga2O3 catalyst after 6 h of reaction at 500 C in the presence of CO2 was attempted. As shown in Fig. 7, the propane conversion on β-Ga2O3 catalyst decreases from 23.3 to 10.8% after 6 h on stream. The reaction was interrupted under a N2 stream, and then O2 was introduced at 500 C for 1 h to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst. The propane conversion on the regenerated catalyst is 17.0%, which is much lower than the initial conversion, showing that the original activity of the catalyst could not be fully restored."

1. The dehydrogenation reaction is proposed to occur via a heterolytic dissociation pathway. The presence of CO2 enhances this reaction due to the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions.
2. The catalytic activity of CO2 towards β-Ga2O3 is more pronounced at temperatures above 550°C.
3. After a 6-hour reaction at 500°C with CO2, the propane conversion on the β-Ga2O3 catalyst drops from 23.3% to 10.8%. Upon regeneration with O2 at 500°C, the propane conversion increases to 17.0%, indicating that the original activity of the catalyst was not fully restored.

1. 脱氢反应通过异裂解反应途径进行，CO2的存在由于逆向水煤气变换反应和布杜瓦反应而增强此反应。
2. CO2对β-Ga2O3催化剂的促进作用在550°C以上更为明显。
3. 在500°C下与CO2反应6小时后，β-Ga2O3催化剂的丙烷转化率从23.3%降至10.8%。在500°C下使用O2进行再生后，丙烷转化率增加到17.0%，表明催化剂的原始活性并未完全恢复。

[1] "H2-TPR and XPS studies show that gallium oxide is hardly reduced below 600 C."
[2] "It is more interesting to note that the O2-regenerated β-Ga2O3 catalyst, after 6 h of reaction in the presence of CO2, is not reduced by H2 in TPR measurements, as shown in Fig. 9, indicating that the part of the reducible gallium oxide species in the catalyst is not restored after regeneration."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, especially in Cr-based and VOx catalysts. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these methods varies, with reoxidation by O2 typically being the most straightforward and efficient approach. However, the extent to which the catalyst can be restored to its initial activity depends on the specific regeneration method used. For instance, β-Ga2O3 catalysts show a notable reduction in reducible oxide species upon reaction and regeneration, which affects their catalytic performance.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化，尤其是在Cr基和VOx催化剂中。不同的再生方法（如使用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化）在有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。这些方法的有效性各不相同，其中使用O2进行氧化通常是最直接和有效的方法。然而，催化剂恢复到初始活性的程度取决于所使用的具体再生方法。例如，β-Ga2O3催化剂在反应和再生后显示出明显的可还原氧化物物种减少，这影响了它们的催化性能。

1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by overoxidation, especially when CO2 is involved. Overoxidation leads to the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, reducing its activity. Various regeneration methods include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Among these, reoxidation with air is generally more effective in restoring catalyst activity, though it may require higher temperatures. CO2 can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction, enhancing catalytic activity and stability.

2. The effectiveness of regeneration methods varies based on their ability to remove carbon deposits and restore active sites. Air reoxidation is typically more successful, but it might necessitate higher temperatures. CO2 regeneration can be less effective, especially at the initial stage of reaction, as it might not fully restore the catalyst's activity. However, CO2 addition can still enhance the reaction by promoting the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard reactions, improving catalytic performance indirectly.

Answer: Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is mainly caused by overoxidation, leading to carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness and temperature requirements. Air reoxidation generally restores catalyst activity better, though it may require higher temperatures. CO2 regeneration can mitigate overoxidation but is less effective at the initial stage of reaction. CO2 addition enhances catalytic activity by facilitating reactions like the reverse water gas shift and Boudouard, improving performance indirectly.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的失效主要由过氧化导致，尤其是二氧化碳参与时。过氧化会导致催化剂表面形成碳沉积物，降低活性。不同的再生方法包括空气、二氧化碳或氧气的再氧化。其中，空气再氧化通常更有效于恢复催化剂活性，但可能需要更高的温度。二氧化碳可以间接增强VOx催化反应，通过促进反向水煤气变换反应和布杜瓦德反应，增强活性和稳定性。

2. 各种再生方法的有效性根据它们去除碳沉积物和恢复活性位点的能力而有所不同。空气再氧化通常更成功，但可能需要更高的温度。二氧化碳再生在初始反应阶段的效果可能较小，因为它可能无法完全恢复催化剂的活性。然而，二氧化碳添加仍可通过促进如反向水煤气变换和布杜瓦德反应来增强催化性能，间接提高性能。
