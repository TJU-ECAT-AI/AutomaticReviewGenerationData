[1] "Experimental results at such a low temperature show that the promoting effect of CO2 is relatively less significant, particularly at the initial stage of reaction."
[2] "The propane conversion increases significantly above 550 C, in particular, in the presence of CO2, demonstrating that β-Ga2O3 is probably the most practical polymorphic form for this type of reaction."
[3] "TPR and XPS studies show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."

1. At lower temperatures, the enhancing effect of CO2 on the oxidative dehydrogenation process is less pronounced, especially during the early stages of the reaction. 
2. Increasing the reaction temperature to above 550°C leads to a significant increase in propane conversion, particularly when CO2 is present, suggesting that β-Ga2O3 is likely the most suitable polymorphic form for this type of reaction.
3. About 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C, but this portion of reducible oxide does not recover after reaction and oxygen regeneration.

1. 在较低温度下，二氧化碳对氧化脱氢过程的增强效果较为有限，特别是在反应早期阶段。
2. 将反应温度提高到550°C以上，丙烷转化率显著增加，尤其是在二氧化碳存在的情况下，这表明β-Ga2O3可能是这种反应类型中最合适的多晶型形式。
3. 大约有15%的原始镓氧化物催化剂可以在500°C以下被还原，但这部分可还原氧化物在反应和氧气再生后无法恢复。
