[1] "Among the polymorphs, β-Ga2O3 exhibits the highest dehydrogenation activity, in both the presence and absence of CO2. It is even more active than chromium oxide in the presence of CO2."
[2] "TPR and XPS results show that about 15 mol% of the fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500 C, but this part of the reducible oxide cannot be restored after reaction and O2 regeneration."
[3] "As regards the promoting effect of CO2, the reverse water gas shift reaction (6) and the Boudouard reaction (7) may play positive roles in the dehydrogenation reaction:"
[4] "Experimental results at such a low temperature show that the promoting effect of CO2 is relatively less significant, particularly at the initial stage of reaction."

1. β-Ga2O3 catalyst demonstrates the highest dehydrogenation activity in both the presence and absence of CO2, surpassing chromium oxide when CO2 is present.

2. About 15 mol% of fresh gallium oxide catalysts can be reduced below 500°C, but this portion of reducible oxide is not restored after reaction and O2 regeneration.

3. The reverse water gas shift reaction and the Boudouard reaction of CO2 contribute positively to enhancing the catalytic activity and stability in the presence of CO2.

4. At low temperatures, the promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction is less pronounced, especially during the initial phase of the reaction.

1. β-Ga2O3催化剂在CO2存在与否下均表现出最高的脱氢活性，且在CO2存在时超过铬基氧化物。

2. 大约15摩尔%的新鲜镓氧化物催化剂可以在500°C以下被还原，但这部分可还原氧化物在反应和氧气再生后无法恢复。

3. 反向水煤气变换反应和二氧化碳的布杜瓦德反应对CO2的存在起着积极的作用，有助于增强催化活性和稳定性。

4. 在低温下，CO2对脱氢反应的促进效果相对较弱，尤其是在反应初期。
