[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking."
[2] "However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."
[3] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[4] "Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products."
[5] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was observed only in the initial state of the reaction."
[6] "However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[7] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[8] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation leading to the formation of carbon oxides and oxygenates, and excessive heat generation requiring heat removal. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have different effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

2. In the context of the literature, the deactivation of gallium oxide catalysts is mainly due to coke deposition and the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction, which is not suppressed by the presence of CO2. Potassium addition to the catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst.

3. The literature does not provide direct comparisons of the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance of different regeneration methods. However, it suggests that CO2 can be beneficial in reducing overoxidation, particularly in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially making it a useful mild oxidant.

4. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts leads to a decrease in catalytic activity, indicating that the reaction occurs primarily on acidic sites of the catalyst, as supported by the fact that potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

1. 在氧化脱氢化过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括过氧化导致碳氧化物和氧的生成，以及过高的热量产生需要去除热量。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化，其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响各不相同。CO2的添加可以在VOx催化的反应中减少过氧化，从而降低氧化程度。

2. 根据文献，镓氧化物催化剂的失效主要由焦炭沉积和反应期间催化剂的快速失效引起，CO2的存在并未抑制催化剂的快速失效过程。向催化剂中添加钾会导致催化剂活性下降，这表明反应主要在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。

3. 文献没有直接比较不同再生方法的有效性、温度需求和对催化性能的影响。然而，它暗示CO2可以作为有用的温和氧化剂，在VOx催化反应中减少过氧化，从而可能使其成为有益的氧化剂。

4. 向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾会导致催化剂活性下降，这表明反应主要在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这与钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂不表现出高活性的事实相符。
