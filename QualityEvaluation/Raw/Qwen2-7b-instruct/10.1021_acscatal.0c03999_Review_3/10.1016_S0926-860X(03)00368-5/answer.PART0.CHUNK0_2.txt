[1] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[2] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[3] "Carbon dioxide consume hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products."
[4] "However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[5] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[6] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of coke deposits, which block active sites, and the overoxidation of the catalyst. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective in restoring the catalyst's activity. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Potassium promotion to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity due to the blocking of active sites. The dehydrogenation equilibrium shifts towards products due to the consumption of hydrogen by carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积堵塞活性位点，以及催化剂过氧化。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化，可以有效地恢复催化剂的活性。CO2添加可以在VOx催化反应中缓解过氧化。向镓氧化物添加钾会导致催化剂活性的丧失，因为这会阻塞活性位点。由于氢被二氧化碳消耗，脱氢反应的平衡向产物方向移动。二氧化碳不能抑制催化剂在反应期间的快速失活。
