<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking.</p>
<p>Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>The key problem is the development of a new catalyst with desirable selectivity.</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations, propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products.</p>
<p>However, the introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow.</p>

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include high temperatures and overoxidation leading to coke formation and loss of active sites. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore catalyst activity by removing deposited coke or reactivating the catalyst surface. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by consuming hydrogen and shifting the equilibrium towards products.

2. The effectiveness of regeneration methods varies depending on factors such as catalyst type, the extent of deactivation, and the specific conditions of the process. Air reoxidation is generally straightforward and applicable across a wide range of catalysts but may require higher temperatures and could lead to additional side reactions. CO2 reoxidation, on the other hand, operates under milder conditions, potentially preserving more of the catalyst's original activity while removing deposited coke. Oxygen reoxidation is effective for catalysts that remain active at elevated temperatures but can lead to further oxidation and loss of selectivity if overdone.

3. XRD analyses of the catalysts show that for all Ga2O3 samples, the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, K2CO3 was detected. No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow. However, the fresh Ga2O3 catalyst was more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失效原因，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括高温和过氧化导致的焦炭形成和活性位点损失。各种再生方法，如通过空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，旨在通过去除沉积的焦炭或重新激活催化剂表面来恢复催化剂活性。通过CO2添加可以减轻在VOx催化反应中发生的过氧化作用，通过消耗氢气并使平衡向丙烯产品方向移动。

2. 各种再生方法的有效性取决于因素如催化剂类型、失活程度以及过程的具体条件。空气重新氧化通常适用于广泛范围内的催化剂，但可能需要更高的温度，并可能导致额外的副反应。CO2重新氧化在更温和的条件下进行，可能保留更多原始活性，同时去除沉积的焦炭。氧气重新氧化对于在较高温度下仍保持活性的催化剂非常有效，但如果处理不当可能导致进一步氧化和选择性的损失。

3. XRD分析显示，所有Ga2O3样品的主要相确认为-Ga2O3，这是已知的唯一稳定的Ga2O3形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，检测到了K2CO3。在碳二酸流下进行的脱氢反应前后，没有观察到衍射图案的显著变化。然而，新鲜的Ga2O3催化剂在873 K反应后比新鲜催化剂更加非晶态。
