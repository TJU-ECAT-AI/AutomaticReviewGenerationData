1. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/SiO2, showed excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. Takahara et al. similarly found a promoting effect of carbon dioxide on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Metal-oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3, were found effective in the presence of CO2 for ethane dehydrogenation by Nakagawa et al. The acidity/basicity properties of gallium oxide catalysts significantly affect their catalytic activity, with supported gallium oxides being preferred over zeolites in NOx reduction reactions due to their weaker acidity.

2. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction process likely occurs on acidic sites of the catalyst, explaining why potassium-promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

1. 支持的铬氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr2O3/SiO2，在以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。Takahara等人在丙烷脱氢反应中也发现二氧化碳对SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂具有促进作用。Nakagawa等人研究了一系列金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下对乙烷进行脱氢，发现镓氧化铝（Ga2O3）是有效的。金属氧化物催化剂的活性受其酸碱性性质的影响，支持的镓氧化铝催化剂由于其较弱的酸性，在NOx还原反应中更倾向于使用于沸石催化剂。

2. 向镓氧化铝催化剂中引入钾会导致催化剂活性的丧失。反应过程可能发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，这就是为什么钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂不表现出高活性的原因。
