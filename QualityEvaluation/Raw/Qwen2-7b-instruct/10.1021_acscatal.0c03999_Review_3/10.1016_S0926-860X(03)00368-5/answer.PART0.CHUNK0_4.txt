[1] "Catalytic dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons has a considerable industrial impact, because it represents a method to obtain unsaturated hydrocarbons from feedstocks of the corresponding paraffins."
[2] "Nowadays, the dehydrogenation of propane has become very important. Propene is used in chemical industry for the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile and high purity polypropylene."
[3] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[4] "Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."
[5] "Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance."
[6] "Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane."
[7] "It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties."
[8] "On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8]."
[9] "In this work the catalytic performance of gallium oxide catalysts in conversion of propane to propene with CO2 have been examined."
[10] "The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be considered as follows:"
[11] "Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products."
[12] "Pulse reaction studies were performed for better understanding of the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane."
[13] "For example, at 873 K at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92%, while in the presence of an inert gas only 75% conversion can be achieved under the same condition."
[14] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[15] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of coke and light alkanes due to thermal cracking reactions at high temperatures. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective in restoring catalyst performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors like temperature requirements and the impact on catalytic performance. Potassium addition to gallium oxide catalysts leads to a loss of catalytic activity, indicating that the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括高温下形成的焦炭和轻烷烃，导致裂解反应。各种再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化，可以有效地恢复催化剂性能。在VOx催化反应中，通过添加CO2可以减轻过氧化。这些方法的有效性取决于温度需求和对催化性能的影响因素。向镓氧化物催化剂中添加钾会导致活性丧失，这表明反应在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。
