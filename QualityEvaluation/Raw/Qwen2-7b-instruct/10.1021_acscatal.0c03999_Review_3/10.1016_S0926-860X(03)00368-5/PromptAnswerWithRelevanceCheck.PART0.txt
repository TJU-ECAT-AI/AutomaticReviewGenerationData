[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking."
[2] "However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."
[3] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[4] "Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products."
[5] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was observed only in the initial state of the reaction."
[6] "However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[7] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[8] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation leading to the formation of carbon oxides and oxygenates, and excessive heat generation requiring heat removal. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have different effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

2. In the context of the literature, the deactivation of gallium oxide catalysts is mainly due to coke deposition and the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction, which is not suppressed by the presence of CO2. Potassium addition to the catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst.

3. The literature does not provide direct comparisons of the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance of different regeneration methods. However, it suggests that CO2 can be beneficial in reducing overoxidation, particularly in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially making it a useful mild oxidant.

4. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts leads to a decrease in catalytic activity, indicating that the reaction occurs primarily on acidic sites of the catalyst, as supported by the fact that potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

1. 在氧化脱氢化过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括过氧化导致碳氧化物和氧的生成，以及过高的热量产生需要去除热量。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化，其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响各不相同。CO2的添加可以在VOx催化的反应中减少过氧化，从而降低氧化程度。

2. 根据文献，镓氧化物催化剂的失效主要由焦炭沉积和反应期间催化剂的快速失效引起，CO2的存在并未抑制催化剂的快速失效过程。向催化剂中添加钾会导致催化剂活性下降，这表明反应主要在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。

3. 文献没有直接比较不同再生方法的有效性、温度需求和对催化性能的影响。然而，它暗示CO2可以作为有用的温和氧化剂，在VOx催化反应中减少过氧化，从而可能使其成为有益的氧化剂。

4. 向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾会导致催化剂活性下降，这表明反应主要在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这与钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂不表现出高活性的事实相符。

1. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly Cr2O3/SiO2, showed excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. Takahara et al. similarly found a promoting effect of carbon dioxide on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Metal-oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3, were found effective in the presence of CO2 for ethane dehydrogenation by Nakagawa et al. The acidity/basicity properties of gallium oxide catalysts significantly affect their catalytic activity, with supported gallium oxides being preferred over zeolites in NOx reduction reactions due to their weaker acidity.

2. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide catalysts leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction process likely occurs on acidic sites of the catalyst, explaining why potassium-promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

1. 支持的铬氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr2O3/SiO2，在以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。Takahara等人在丙烷脱氢反应中也发现二氧化碳对SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂具有促进作用。Nakagawa等人研究了一系列金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下对乙烷进行脱氢，发现镓氧化铝（Ga2O3）是有效的。金属氧化物催化剂的活性受其酸碱性性质的影响，支持的镓氧化铝催化剂由于其较弱的酸性，在NOx还原反应中更倾向于使用于沸石催化剂。

2. 向镓氧化铝催化剂中引入钾会导致催化剂活性的丧失。反应过程可能发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，这就是为什么钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂不表现出高活性的原因。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of coke deposits, which block active sites, and the overoxidation of the catalyst. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective in restoring the catalyst's activity. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Potassium promotion to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity due to the blocking of active sites. The dehydrogenation equilibrium shifts towards products due to the consumption of hydrogen by carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积堵塞活性位点，以及催化剂过氧化。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化，可以有效地恢复催化剂的活性。CO2添加可以在VOx催化反应中缓解过氧化。向镓氧化物添加钾会导致催化剂活性的丧失，因为这会阻塞活性位点。由于氢被二氧化碳消耗，脱氢反应的平衡向产物方向移动。二氧化碳不能抑制催化剂在反应期间的快速失活。

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include high temperatures and overoxidation leading to coke formation and loss of active sites. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore catalyst activity by removing deposited coke or reactivating the catalyst surface. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by consuming hydrogen and shifting the equilibrium towards products.

2. The effectiveness of regeneration methods varies depending on factors such as catalyst type, the extent of deactivation, and the specific conditions of the process. Air reoxidation is generally straightforward and applicable across a wide range of catalysts but may require higher temperatures and could lead to additional side reactions. CO2 reoxidation, on the other hand, operates under milder conditions, potentially preserving more of the catalyst's original activity while removing deposited coke. Oxygen reoxidation is effective for catalysts that remain active at elevated temperatures but can lead to further oxidation and loss of selectivity if overdone.

3. XRD analyses of the catalysts show that for all Ga2O3 samples, the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, K2CO3 was detected. No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow. However, the fresh Ga2O3 catalyst was more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失效原因，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括高温和过氧化导致的焦炭形成和活性位点损失。各种再生方法，如通过空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，旨在通过去除沉积的焦炭或重新激活催化剂表面来恢复催化剂活性。通过CO2添加可以减轻在VOx催化反应中发生的过氧化作用，通过消耗氢气并使平衡向丙烯产品方向移动。

2. 各种再生方法的有效性取决于因素如催化剂类型、失活程度以及过程的具体条件。空气重新氧化通常适用于广泛范围内的催化剂，但可能需要更高的温度，并可能导致额外的副反应。CO2重新氧化在更温和的条件下进行，可能保留更多原始活性，同时去除沉积的焦炭。氧气重新氧化对于在较高温度下仍保持活性的催化剂非常有效，但如果处理不当可能导致进一步氧化和选择性的损失。

3. XRD分析显示，所有Ga2O3样品的主要相确认为-Ga2O3，这是已知的唯一稳定的Ga2O3形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，检测到了K2CO3。在碳二酸流下进行的脱氢反应前后，没有观察到衍射图案的显著变化。然而，新鲜的Ga2O3催化剂在873 K反应后比新鲜催化剂更加非晶态。
