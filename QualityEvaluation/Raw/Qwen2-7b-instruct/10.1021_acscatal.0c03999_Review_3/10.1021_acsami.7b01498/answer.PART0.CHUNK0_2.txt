The literature does not provide direct quotes or information regarding the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, particularly focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, or a comparison of various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Additionally, it does not discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Therefore, no specific quotes or answers can be provided for these questions based on the given literature.
