1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly detailed in the provided literature. However, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, the literature suggests that the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance vary significantly based on the regeneration method employed. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 has been discussed in the context of these catalysts, with implications for overoxidation mitigation in VOx-catalyzed reactions through the use of CO2 addition.

1. 在提供的文献中，金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因没有明确说明。然而，对于Cr基和VOx催化剂，文献提到了再生方法的有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响差异显著。空气、CO2或O2的再氧化方法在这些催化剂的背景下被讨论，通过在VOx催化反应中添加CO2来缓解过氧化的可能性。
