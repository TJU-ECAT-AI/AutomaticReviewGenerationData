What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are not explicitly detailed in the provided literature. However, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, the literature suggests that the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance vary significantly based on the regeneration method employed. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 has been discussed in the context of these catalysts, with implications for overoxidation mitigation in VOx-catalyzed reactions through the use of CO2 addition.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been utilized to restore their activity. Reoxidation with air generally demands higher temperatures compared to reoxidation with CO2 or O2. CO2 addition has been proposed as a possible approach to alleviate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
