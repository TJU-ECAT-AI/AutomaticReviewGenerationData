The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been utilized to restore their activity. Reoxidation with air generally demands higher temperatures compared to reoxidation with CO2 or O2. CO2 addition has been proposed as a possible approach to alleviate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因包括过氧化和中毒，尤其是Cr基和VOx催化剂。已采用多种再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，以恢复其活性。与使用CO2或O2重新氧化相比，空气重新氧化通常需要更高的温度。有人提议通过向VOx催化反应中添加CO2来缓解过氧化问题。
