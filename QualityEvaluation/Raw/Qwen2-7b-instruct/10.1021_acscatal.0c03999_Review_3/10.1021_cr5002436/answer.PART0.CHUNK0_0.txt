[1] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[2] "The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."
[3] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "This phenomenon has been measured by UVvis spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 18."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. This deposition leads to a drop in activity and requires frequent regeneration through combustion. During this process, heat is released which aids in the regeneration of the catalyst by redispersing chromia crystallites. However, the heat also leads to the incorporation of Cr3+ species into the alumina framework. The similarity in ionic radii and charge between Al3+ and Cr3+ allows Cr3+ to diffuse and get incorporated into the alumina, resulting in an inactive form of chromiaalumina spinel. The decrease in the amount of catalytically active Cr species with each regeneration step is confirmed by UVvis spectroscopy measurements.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是表面积炭沉积。这导致活性下降，并需要通过燃烧积炭进行频繁再生。此过程释放的热量有助于通过重新分散铬晶粒来再生催化剂。然而，这种热量也会导致Cr3+离子扩散并进入氧化铝结构，形成一种无法用于脱氢反应的氧化铝-铬氧盐。每次再生步骤后，催化活性Cr物种的数量减少证实了UV可见光谱测量的结果。
