[1] "Catalyst systems displaying high yields combined with low deactivation rates are preferred."
[2] "Within each type of catalyst high yields often coincide with relatively low deactivation rates, which is counterintuitive."
[3] "However, metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[6] "Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[7] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."
[8] "Recent reports suggest that in the near future, operando spectroscopy will provide the means for more sophisticated process control."
[9] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state."
