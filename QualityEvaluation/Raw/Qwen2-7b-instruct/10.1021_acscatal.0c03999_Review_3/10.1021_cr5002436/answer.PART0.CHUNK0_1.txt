[1] "During the initial stages of the reaction, highly oxidized, and thus catalytically inactive, chromium species are being reduced to active chromium species with lower oxidation states."
[2] "The heat released through the combustion of coke during regeneration leads to the incorporation of chromia into the alumina framework, which causes the amount of catalytically active Cr species to decrease with each regeneration step."
[3] "Some studies correlating dehydrogenation activity with Cr-speciation suggested that a vast majority of catalytic activity can be ascribed to the dispersed Cr3+ phase, the role of the other phases being the replenishment of the depleted Cr3+ surface phase during long runs."
[4] "The choice of zirconia over alumina as the catalyst support offers the additional advantage of preventing the formation of CrAl mixed oxides."
[5] "The fact that activity and Cr loading hold an almost linear relationship below monolayer coverage suggests that both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers are catalytically active."

1. During the initial stages of the reaction, chromium species are reduced to active ones with lower oxidation states.
2. The heat from coke combustion during regeneration causes chromia to be incorporated into the alumina, reducing the active Cr species.
3. Studies suggest that the majority of activity is due to the dispersed Cr3+ phase, with other phases replenishing the surface phase during long runs.
4. Using zirconia as the catalyst support prevents the formation of CrAl mixed oxides.
5. Below monolayer coverage, both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers show catalytic activity.

1. 反应初期，氧化程度高的、活性较低的铬物种被还原为氧化状态更低的活性物种。
2. 焚烧焦炭时释放的热量导致铬氧化物被整合到氧化铝中，每次再生步骤都导致活性铬物种数量减少。
3. 研究表明，大部分活性归因于分散的Cr3+相，其他相在长时间运行期间补充表面相。
4. 使用锆作为催化剂支持可以防止形成CrAl混合氧化物。
5. 在单层覆盖率以下，孤立的和簇状的Cr3+中心显示出催化活性。
