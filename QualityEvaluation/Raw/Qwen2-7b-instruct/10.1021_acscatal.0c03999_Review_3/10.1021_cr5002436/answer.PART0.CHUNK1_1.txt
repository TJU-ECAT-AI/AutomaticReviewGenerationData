[1] "Catalyst systems displaying high yields combined with low deactivation rates are preferred."
[2] "Metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, albeit they deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations."
[3] "Oxidative dehydrogenation does not have the thermodynamic limitations shown by nonoxidative dehydrogenation."
[4] "Finding a suitable combination of catalyst material and oxidizing agent will be pivotal in the development of an effective reaction system for the oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins."
[5] "UVvis spectroscopy can be used to monitor noninvasively the amount and type of coke as the latter forms and accumulates on the catalyst surface."
[6] "Coke deposition was observed to occur faster at the top of the catalyst bed, which was attributed to the temperature gradient measured in the reactor."
[7] "These measurements show that the duration of the dehydrogenation and regeneration phases could be dynamically adjusted to keep the catalyst in its most active state."

1. Catalysts that combine high yield with low deactivation rate are favored.
2. Metal oxide catalysts match Pt catalyst yields but deactivate quicker.
3. Oxidative dehydrogenation lacks thermodynamic constraints of nonoxidative dehydrogenation.
4. Selecting the right catalyst material and oxidizer pair is key for effective oxidative dehydrogenation.
5. UVvis spectroscopy enables non-invasive monitoring of coke formation on catalysts.
6. Coke deposition happens more quickly at the top of the catalyst bed due to temperature variations.
