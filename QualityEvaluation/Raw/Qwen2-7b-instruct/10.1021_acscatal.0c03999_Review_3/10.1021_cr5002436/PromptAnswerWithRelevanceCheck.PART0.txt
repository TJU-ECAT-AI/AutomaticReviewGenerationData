[1] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[2] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[3] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[4] "Catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition. Coke blocks pores and active sites, hindering reactant diffusion and causing a decline in catalytic activity. Coke can grow by DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones, forming graphitic sheets that cover active sites.

2. Regeneration methods for deactivating metal oxide catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Air reoxidation is effective but requires higher temperatures, potentially affecting catalytic performance. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions but may also introduce additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction. O2 reoxidation is efficient but can be toxic to some catalyst materials.

3. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods depends on factors such as temperature requirements, the potential for side reactions, and the impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation is broad but may not suit all catalysts due to its high temperature requirement. CO2 reoxidation offers a compromise in avoiding overoxidation but introduces coke formation challenges. O2 reoxidation is highly effective but requires careful consideration of catalyst toxicity.

4. In comparing the performance of metal oxide catalysts, the space velocity (WHSV), deactivation rate, and initial yield were key metrics. Catalysts with high yields and low deactivation rates at high space velocities were preferred. Pt-based catalysts were noted for their ability to operate at higher space velocities with lower deactivation rates, indicating superior performance. Specific activity calculations confirmed the high activity of Pt catalysts compared to metal oxides, with differences in the order of magnitude. The differences in specific activity could be partly explained by the lower energy barrier for the rate-limiting step in Pt-based catalysts, although discrepancies in activation energy calculations and model surfaces limit the direct applicability of these findings.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中，特别是Cr和VOx催化剂中，主要失效原因是由焦炭沉积引起。焦炭堵塞孔隙和活性位点，阻碍反应物扩散，导致催化活性下降。焦炭可以通过迪尔斯-阿尔德型加成、丙烯向自由基的加成或更小域融合成更大结构的方式生长，形成覆盖活性位点的石墨状层片。

2. 催化剂的再生方法包括空气、二氧化碳或氧气的再氧化。空气再氧化有效但可能需要较高温度，可能影响催化性能。二氧化碳再氧化可以避免VOx催化反应中的过氧化，但可能会因水煤气逆向反应引入额外的焦炭沉积。氧气再氧化效率高，但需要考虑催化剂的毒性。

3. 不同再生方法的有效性取决于温度要求、潜在副反应以及对催化性能的影响等因素。空气再氧化具有普适性，但可能不适合所有催化剂，因其可能需要较高的温度。二氧化碳再氧化提供了一种平衡，避免了过氧化，但也引入了由于水煤气逆向反应而产生的焦炭沉积挑战。氧气再氧化非常有效，但需要仔细考虑催化剂的毒性。

4. 在比较金属氧化物催化剂的性能时，空间速度（WHSV）、失活速率和初始产率是关键指标。高产率和低失活率在高空间速度下的催化剂被优先考虑。铂基催化剂因其能够在更高空间速度下运行且失活速率较低，显示出了优越的性能。特定活动计算确认了铂催化剂与金属氧化物相比的高活性，差异范围可达数量级。特定活动值的差异部分可解释为铂基催化剂中率决定步骤的能量壁垒较低，尽管模型表面和激活能量计算方法的差异限制了这些发现的直接应用。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface. This deposition leads to a drop in activity and requires frequent regeneration through combustion. During this process, heat is released which aids in the regeneration of the catalyst by redispersing chromia crystallites. However, the heat also leads to the incorporation of Cr3+ species into the alumina framework. The similarity in ionic radii and charge between Al3+ and Cr3+ allows Cr3+ to diffuse and get incorporated into the alumina, resulting in an inactive form of chromiaalumina spinel. The decrease in the amount of catalytically active Cr species with each regeneration step is confirmed by UVvis spectroscopy measurements.

[1] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."
[2] "Secondly, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, the concomitant loss in active sites also resulting in catalyst deactivation."

Deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts primarily occurs due to two processes. Firstly, the formation of carbon deposits leading to the coverage of active sites with coke reduces catalyst activity. Secondly, the high temperatures involved in both the regeneration and dehydrogenation processes cause the agglomeration or sintering of platinum nanoparticles, leading to a loss in active sites and further deactivation.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition, which blocks pores and active sites on the catalyst surface, hindering reactant diffusion and causing a drop in catalytic activity. Coke grows from aromatic rings through DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones. Smaller polyaromatic species can migrate from the metal to the support, undergoing further oligomerization and condensation. A low amount of coke deposition can increase catalytic activity by facilitating alkane adsorption near active sites, but large graphitic sheets covering active sites make coke detrimental. Regeneration under an oxidative atmosphere helps mitigate coke-induced deactivation. Strategies to control coke formation include using supports with little to no Brnsted acidity, poisoning acid sites, and cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.

The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, in terms of their temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance, is not explicitly detailed in the document. However, reoxidation with air typically requires high temperatures and can help burn off coke deposits. CO2 reoxidation might involve lower temperatures but could potentially lead to coke gasification, depending on the specifics of the catalyst and process conditions. Oxygen reoxidation could offer a balance between efficiency and potential for overoxidation, but the precise comparative effectiveness and temperature requirements for these methods are not provided.

Adding CO2 to the feed can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by consuming hydrogen formed during the reaction. This helps maintain high olefin selectivity. However, CO2 addition can also lead to additional coke deposition due to changes in the hydrogen and CO partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. CO2 can also compete with the surface of the catalyst, potentially affecting performance, but its specific impact on catalytic performance in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not extensively discussed in the document.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积。焦炭在催化剂表面上形成，阻塞孔隙和活性位点，阻碍反应物扩散，导致催化活性下降。焦炭从芳环通过迪尔斯-阿尔德反应、丙烯插入到自由基或较小域融合成更大域来生长。较小的聚芳烃物种可以从金属迁移到支持体，在那里它们可以进一步发生聚合化和凝缩。少量的焦炭沉积可以通过促进烷烃吸附到活性脱氢位置附近，从而增加催化活性。但当大量的石墨状片层覆盖活性位点时，焦炭变得有害。为应对焦炭引起的失活，已将氧化气氛下的再生步骤整合到工业脱氢过程中。控制焦炭形成的一些策略包括使用几乎没有Brnsted酸性的支持体或毒化酸性位点，以及添加蒸汽、氢气或CO2来减少焦炭形成。

各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，其温度要求和对催化性能的影响的有效性没有明确地在文档中阐述。然而，空气重新氧化通常需要高温，并有助于清除焦炭沉积。CO2重新氧化可能涉及较低的温度，但也可能导致焦炭气化，具体取决于催化剂和过程条件的细节。氧气重新氧化可能提供效率和潜在过氧化之间的平衡，但这些方法的具体有效性和温度要求没有详细说明。

向反应流体中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化剂催化的反应中的过氧化作用，通过消耗生成的氢气来维持高烯烃选择性。然而，CO2的添加也可能导致额外的焦炭沉积，因为反向水-煤气变换反应带来的氢和CO分压的变化。CO2也可以与催化剂表面竞争，可能影响性能，但关于CO2在VOx催化剂催化的反应中的具体影响的讨论并不充分。

1. The primary cause of deactivation for metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, such as those involving chromium (Cr) and vanadium (VOx), is the deposition of coke. This deposition covers the active sites of the catalysts, leading to a drop in their activity. Regeneration methods involve combusting the coke deposits to restore the catalyst's functionality. 

2. Various regeneration methods differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used, but their impacts vary. CO2 addition to VOx-catalyzed reactions can mitigate overoxidation, which refers to the excess oxidation of reaction products, potentially enhancing the selectivity towards desired products while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts.
