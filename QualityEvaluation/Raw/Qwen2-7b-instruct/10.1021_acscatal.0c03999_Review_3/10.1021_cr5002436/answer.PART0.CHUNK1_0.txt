[1] "Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[2] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[3] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[4] "Catalysts were only included in this comparison if the space velocity, deactivation rate, and initial yield could be determined from the information provided in the original source."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke deposition. Coke blocks pores and active sites, hindering reactant diffusion and causing a decline in catalytic activity. Coke can grow by DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones, forming graphitic sheets that cover active sites.

2. Regeneration methods for deactivating metal oxide catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Air reoxidation is effective but requires higher temperatures, potentially affecting catalytic performance. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions but may also introduce additional coke deposition due to the reverse watergas shift reaction. O2 reoxidation is efficient but can be toxic to some catalyst materials.

3. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods depends on factors such as temperature requirements, the potential for side reactions, and the impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation is broad but may not suit all catalysts due to its high temperature requirement. CO2 reoxidation offers a compromise in avoiding overoxidation but introduces coke formation challenges. O2 reoxidation is highly effective but requires careful consideration of catalyst toxicity.

4. In comparing the performance of metal oxide catalysts, the space velocity (WHSV), deactivation rate, and initial yield were key metrics. Catalysts with high yields and low deactivation rates at high space velocities were preferred. Pt-based catalysts were noted for their ability to operate at higher space velocities with lower deactivation rates, indicating superior performance. Specific activity calculations confirmed the high activity of Pt catalysts compared to metal oxides, with differences in the order of magnitude. The differences in specific activity could be partly explained by the lower energy barrier for the rate-limiting step in Pt-based catalysts, although discrepancies in activation energy calculations and model surfaces limit the direct applicability of these findings.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中，特别是Cr和VOx催化剂中，主要失效原因是由焦炭沉积引起。焦炭堵塞孔隙和活性位点，阻碍反应物扩散，导致催化活性下降。焦炭可以通过迪尔斯-阿尔德型加成、丙烯向自由基的加成或更小域融合成更大结构的方式生长，形成覆盖活性位点的石墨状层片。

2. 催化剂的再生方法包括空气、二氧化碳或氧气的再氧化。空气再氧化有效但可能需要较高温度，可能影响催化性能。二氧化碳再氧化可以避免VOx催化反应中的过氧化，但可能会因水煤气逆向反应引入额外的焦炭沉积。氧气再氧化效率高，但需要考虑催化剂的毒性。

3. 不同再生方法的有效性取决于温度要求、潜在副反应以及对催化性能的影响等因素。空气再氧化具有普适性，但可能不适合所有催化剂，因其可能需要较高的温度。二氧化碳再氧化提供了一种平衡，避免了过氧化，但也引入了由于水煤气逆向反应而产生的焦炭沉积挑战。氧气再氧化非常有效，但需要仔细考虑催化剂的毒性。

4. 在比较金属氧化物催化剂的性能时，空间速度（WHSV）、失活速率和初始产率是关键指标。高产率和低失活率在高空间速度下的催化剂被优先考虑。铂基催化剂因其能够在更高空间速度下运行且失活速率较低，显示出了优越的性能。特定活动计算确认了铂催化剂与金属氧化物相比的高活性，差异范围可达数量级。特定活动值的差异部分可解释为铂基催化剂中率决定步骤的能量壁垒较低，尽管模型表面和激活能量计算方法的差异限制了这些发现的直接应用。
