[1] "Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."
[2] "Secondly, the high temperature of both the regeneration process and the dehydrogenation reaction triggers the agglomeration or sintering of the platinum nanoparticles, the concomitant loss in active sites also resulting in catalyst deactivation."

Deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts primarily occurs due to two processes. Firstly, the formation of carbon deposits leading to the coverage of active sites with coke reduces catalyst activity. Secondly, the high temperatures involved in both the regeneration and dehydrogenation processes cause the agglomeration or sintering of platinum nanoparticles, leading to a loss in active sites and further deactivation.

铂基脱氢催化剂失活主要归因于两个过程。首先，碳沉积物的形成导致活性位点被焦炭覆盖，从而降低催化剂活性。其次，再生和脱氢过程中涉及的高温导致铂纳米颗粒的聚集或烧结，导致活性位点损失并进一步导致催化剂失活。

[1] "As is shown in Figure 14 with XANES and in Figure 15 with UVvis spectroscopy, it was observed that surface Cr3+ species are produced at the expense of Cr6+ species during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction and that polychromate is more easily reduced than monochromate."
[2] "Indeed, it has been observed that Cr5+ species that are not reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere can be reduced by alkanes."

As demonstrated by the XANES and UVvis spectroscopy in Figures 14 and 15, it was noted that chromium(III) surface species form at the expense of chromium(VI) species during the early stages of the dehydrogenation process. Moreover, it was found that polychromates are more readily reduced than monochromates. Importantly, chromium(V) species that do not reduce in a hydrogen atmosphere can be reduced by alkanes.

正如在图14和图15中通过XANES和UVvis光谱分析所显示的那样，在脱氢反应的初期阶段，表面铬(III)物种以牺牲铬(VI)物种的形式形成。此外，观察到多价铬比单价铬更容易还原。值得注意的是，那些在氢气气氛下不还原的铬(V)物种可以通过烷烃进行还原。

[1] "Experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (1040 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."
[2] "However, conversion continues to drop beyond this point, which indicates that the carbon originally deposited becomes more detrimental for the catalytic activity over time."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Tests using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), depicted in Figure 17, showed that the catalyst's weight grows during the first stages (10 to 40 minutes) of the reaction, with no extra carbon being laid down thereafter. Yet, the conversion rate keeps declining after this juncture, signifying that the initially deposited carbon increasingly hinders the catalyst's functionality over time.

使用尖端元件振荡微天平（TEOM）进行的实验，如图17所示，揭示了反应初期（10至40分钟）催化剂重量增加的情况，并且之后不再有额外的碳沉积。然而，在这个时间点之后，转化率持续下降，表明最初沉积的碳随着时间的推移逐渐对催化活性产生更不利的影响。

[1] "To summarize, it is possible to achieve high activity and selectivity over Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts by adjusting the composition of the catalysts and/or the operating conditions."
[2] "It is important to note that the advantages offered by the combustion of coke during the regeneration step far outweigh these unwanted side effects."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To sum up, optimizing the catalyst composition and/or operating conditions allows for achieving high activity and selectivity in Cr-based hydrogenation catalysts. It's crucial to recognize that the benefits derived from the coke combustion during the regeneration process significantly surpass the negative impacts of these side effects.

总结来说，通过调整催化剂组成和/或操作条件，可以实现Cr基加氢催化剂的高活性和选择性。重要的是要注意，再生过程中焦炭燃烧带来的优势远远超过了这些副作用的负面影响。
