[1] "As it is not possible to completely prevent coke deposition, the catalyst needs to be regenerated frequently by combusting the coke deposits."
[2] "This phenomenon has been measured by UVvis spectroscopy, as shown in Figure 18. In the figure, a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is treated at 1100 C for 12 h, which results in the bands corresponding to Cr3+ species to shift, signaling the incorporation of Cr3+ species into the alumina support."
[3] "Indeed, when the space velocity (GHSV) decreased from 3600 to 600 h−1, ethane conversion increased from 27.6% to 31.4%, while selectivity to ethylene decreased from 91.7% to 64.9%."

1. The primary cause of deactivation for metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, such as those involving chromium (Cr) and vanadium (VOx), is the deposition of coke. This deposition covers the active sites of the catalysts, leading to a drop in their activity. Regeneration methods involve combusting the coke deposits to restore the catalyst's functionality. 

2. Various regeneration methods differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used, but their impacts vary. CO2 addition to VOx-catalyzed reactions can mitigate overoxidation, which refers to the excess oxidation of reaction products, potentially enhancing the selectivity towards desired products while minimizing the formation of undesired byproducts.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积。这种沉积会覆盖催化剂的活性位点，导致活性下降。再生方法通过燃烧沉积的焦炭来恢复催化剂的功能。

2. 不同的再生方法在有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。空气、CO2或O2的再氧化可以使用，但它们的影响各不相同。向VOx催化的反应中添加CO2可以缓解过氧化，即对产物的过度氧化，可能增强对所需产品的选择性，同时减少副产品的形成。
