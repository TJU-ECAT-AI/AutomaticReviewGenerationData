[1] "Catalyst Deactivation: Two main processes cause the deactivation of Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. First and foremost, the side reactions that form carbon deposits on the catalyst surface lead to the coverage of the active sites with coke, which results in a drop in activity."
[2] "A third important factor determining catalyst sintering is the interaction between Pt and the catalyst support. Nagai et al. reported that Pt on Al2O3 readily sinter after treatment in air at 800 C, while Pt on CeO2 remains stable due to the strong interaction between ceria and Pt."
[3] "A secondary effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum. Alloyed metallic Sn or Sn2+ species in close contact with platinum are able to transfer electrons to the 5d band of platinum atoms, which alters the adsorptive and catalytic properties of the metal."
[4] "It is important to note that the advantages offered by the combustion of coke during the regeneration step far outweigh these unwanted side effects. First and foremost, the heat released in this step is harnessed to fuel the dehydrogenation reaction, making coke deposition not completely undesirable."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of carbon deposits leading to coke coverage of active sites, and the sintering of metal particles due to interactions with the catalyst support. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by facilitating the removal of evolved hydrogen, thus shifting the equilibrium towards product formation without causing overoxidation of catalytically active Cr3+ species.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括碳沉积导致活性位点被焦炭覆盖，以及由于与催化剂载体之间的相互作用导致金属粒子聚集。不同的再生方法，在其有效性和温度要求、对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。二氧化碳添加可以缓解VOx催化反应中的过氧化问题，通过促进生成氢的去除，从而推动产物形成，同时避免催化活性Cr3+物种的过度氧化。
