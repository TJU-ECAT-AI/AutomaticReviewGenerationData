[1] "Catalyst systems displaying high yields combined with low deactivation rates are preferred."
[2] "Propylene yield during propane dehydrogenation (left) and isobutene yield during isobutane dehydrogenation (right) versus the deactivation rate of catalysts included in Tables 39."
[3] "Catalysts tend to deactivate faster when higher space velocities are used."
[4] "Although alternative catalysts, most notably metal oxides such as GaOx, MoOx, and VOx, have received significant attention over the last decades, a practicable alternative to the PtSn and CrOx systems has not yet been developed."
[5] "For both the Pt and the CrOx formulations used industrially, the elimination of coke from the surface of the spent catalysts may result in irreversible catalyst deactivation if the regeneration conditions are not carefully controlled."

1. Catalysts that offer high yields of olefins while experiencing minimal deactivation over time are favored.

2. The propylene and isobutene yields are plotted against the deactivation rates of catalysts in Tables 39, allowing for a comparison of performance.

3. Catalysts tend to lose efficiency more quickly when subjected to higher space velocities.

4. Despite extensive research, practical alternatives to the PtSn and CrOx catalyst systems have not emerged, with alternative materials like GaOx, MoOx, and VOx still facing challenges.

5. Proper control of regeneration conditions is crucial to prevent irreversible damage to catalysts like Pt and CrOx during the removal of coke, which can lead to deactivation.

1. 高产率同时低失活率的催化剂更受欢迎。

2. 在表格39中，丙烯和异丁烯的产率与催化剂的失活速率的关系图，用于比较性能。

3. 当使用更高的空间速度时，催化剂会更快地失去效率。

4. 尽管进行了大量研究，但至今尚未出现可替代PtSn和CrOx系统的实用催化剂，如GaOx、MoOx和VOx等材料仍然面临挑战。

5. 正确控制再生条件对于防止Pt和CrOx等催化剂在除焦过程中的不可逆损坏至关重要，这可能导致失活。
