The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition, which blocks pores and active sites on the catalyst surface, hindering reactant diffusion and causing a drop in catalytic activity. Coke grows from aromatic rings through DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones. Smaller polyaromatic species can migrate from the metal to the support, undergoing further oligomerization and condensation. A low amount of coke deposition can increase catalytic activity by facilitating alkane adsorption near active sites, but large graphitic sheets covering active sites make coke detrimental. Regeneration under an oxidative atmosphere helps mitigate coke-induced deactivation. Strategies to control coke formation include using supports with little to no Brnsted acidity, poisoning acid sites, and cofeeding steam, hydrogen, or CO2.

The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, in terms of their temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance, is not explicitly detailed in the document. However, reoxidation with air typically requires high temperatures and can help burn off coke deposits. CO2 reoxidation might involve lower temperatures but could potentially lead to coke gasification, depending on the specifics of the catalyst and process conditions. Oxygen reoxidation could offer a balance between efficiency and potential for overoxidation, but the precise comparative effectiveness and temperature requirements for these methods are not provided.

Adding CO2 to the feed can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by consuming hydrogen formed during the reaction. This helps maintain high olefin selectivity. However, CO2 addition can also lead to additional coke deposition due to changes in the hydrogen and CO partial pressures brought about by the reverse water-gas shift reaction. CO2 can also compete with the surface of the catalyst, potentially affecting performance, but its specific impact on catalytic performance in VOx-catalyzed reactions is not extensively discussed in the document.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积。焦炭在催化剂表面上形成，阻塞孔隙和活性位点，阻碍反应物扩散，导致催化活性下降。焦炭从芳环通过迪尔斯-阿尔德反应、丙烯插入到自由基或较小域融合成更大域来生长。较小的聚芳烃物种可以从金属迁移到支持体，在那里它们可以进一步发生聚合化和凝缩。少量的焦炭沉积可以通过促进烷烃吸附到活性脱氢位置附近，从而增加催化活性。但当大量的石墨状片层覆盖活性位点时，焦炭变得有害。为应对焦炭引起的失活，已将氧化气氛下的再生步骤整合到工业脱氢过程中。控制焦炭形成的一些策略包括使用几乎没有Brnsted酸性的支持体或毒化酸性位点，以及添加蒸汽、氢气或CO2来减少焦炭形成。

各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，其温度要求和对催化性能的影响的有效性没有明确地在文档中阐述。然而，空气重新氧化通常需要高温，并有助于清除焦炭沉积。CO2重新氧化可能涉及较低的温度，但也可能导致焦炭气化，具体取决于催化剂和过程条件的细节。氧气重新氧化可能提供效率和潜在过氧化之间的平衡，但这些方法的具体有效性和温度要求没有详细说明。

向反应流体中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化剂催化的反应中的过氧化作用，通过消耗生成的氢气来维持高烯烃选择性。然而，CO2的添加也可能导致额外的焦炭沉积，因为反向水-煤气变换反应带来的氢和CO分压的变化。CO2也可以与催化剂表面竞争，可能影响性能，但关于CO2在VOx催化剂催化的反应中的具体影响的讨论并不充分。
