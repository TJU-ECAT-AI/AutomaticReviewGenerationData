[1] "Moreover, no reactions were observed over the silica support at relevant temperatures (600 C and below) employed in this study to investigate propane ODH reactions."
[2] "The main difference in reaction products observed for CO2 and O2 ODH reactions was the significant amount of CO produced in the former case and methane in the latter."
[3] "The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."
[4] "These results suggested that the acidic silica support may also play a role in initiating carbon deposition by adsorbing hydrocarbon intermediates during the ODH reaction in the presence of CO2."
[5] "However, the exposure of the silica surface to hydrocarbon intermediates is minimized above monolayer coverage of the VOx species, for example, for S4 (6.6 V/nm2), and this explains the diminished carbon deposition observed for this catalyst (ca. 2% weight loss)."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include carbon deposition and overoxidation. Carbon deposition occurs when hydrocarbon intermediates are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, especially when the acidic silica support plays a role in initiating this process, especially at lower vanadium surface coverages. Overoxidation, which leads to the formation of inactive phases, is observed when the vanadium content exceeds the theoretical monolayer coverage, as seen in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or other reduced V3+/V4+ phases. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can mitigate deactivation. Reoxidation with O2 is generally effective for regenerating Cr-based catalysts, while CO2 can be used to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by reducing the extent of carbon deposition and regenerating active vanadia species. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on the temperature requirements and the impact on catalytic performance, which varies depending on the specific catalyst and the reaction conditions.

在氧化脱氢化过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括碳沉积和过氧化。碳沉积发生在酸性硅支持作用下，特别是当吸附中间体的催化剂表面时，尤其是在较低的钒表面覆盖度下。过氧化导致形成无活性相，观察到当钒含量超过理论单层覆盖率时，表面形成表面Na五氧化二钒或其它还原的V3+/V4+相。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，可以缓解失活。对于Cr基催化剂，使用O2进行再氧化通常效果较好。而对于VOx催化反应，通过减少碳沉积的范围和重新生成活性钒相，使用CO2可以缓解过氧化。然而，这些方法的有效性取决于温度要求和对催化性能的影响，这取决于具体的催化剂和反应条件。
