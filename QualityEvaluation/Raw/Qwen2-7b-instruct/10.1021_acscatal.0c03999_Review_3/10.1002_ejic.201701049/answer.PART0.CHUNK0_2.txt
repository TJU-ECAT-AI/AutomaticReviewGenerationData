[1] "promotion with Na+ significantly improved the dispersion of VOx species but resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate, which lacked catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[2] "The addition of Na resulted in the appearance of Raman peaks at 506, 637, 914, and 950 cm1 associated with the presence of Na metavanadate instead of 2D or 3D vanadia."
[3] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of surface phases that lack catalytic activity. In the case of VOx catalysts, promotion with Na+ significantly improved dispersion of VOx species but led to the formation of surface Na metavanadate, which lacks catalytic activity. Similarly, the addition of Na resulted in the formation of Na metavanadate, which is inactive in propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective depending on the specific catalyst type and deactivation mechanism. CO2 addition might mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing an alternative oxidant, potentially improving catalytic performance.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的失活主要原因是表面形成缺乏催化活性的相。对于VOx催化剂，Na+的促进显著提高了VOx物种的分散性，但导致了表面Na metavanadate的形成，这在丙烷氧化脱氢中缺乏活性。同样，Na的添加导致了Na metavanadate的形成，这在CO2存在的丙烷氧化脱氢中缺乏活性。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，根据具体的催化剂类型和失活机制，可以有效。CO2的添加可能通过提供替代氧化剂来减轻VOx催化的过氧化，从而改善催化性能。
