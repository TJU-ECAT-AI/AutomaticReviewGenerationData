[1] "Moreover, no reactions were observed over the silica support at relevant temperatures (600 C and below) employed in this study to investigate propane ODH reactions."
[2] "The main difference in reaction products observed for CO2 and O2 ODH reactions was the significant amount of CO produced in the former case and methane in the latter."
[3] "The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."
[4] "These results suggested that the acidic silica support may also play a role in initiating carbon deposition by adsorbing hydrocarbon intermediates during the ODH reaction in the presence of CO2."
[5] "However, the exposure of the silica surface to hydrocarbon intermediates is minimized above monolayer coverage of the VOx species, for example, for S4 (6.6 V/nm2), and this explains the diminished carbon deposition observed for this catalyst (ca. 2% weight loss)."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include carbon deposition and overoxidation. Carbon deposition occurs when hydrocarbon intermediates are adsorbed onto the catalyst surface, especially when the acidic silica support plays a role in initiating this process, especially at lower vanadium surface coverages. Overoxidation, which leads to the formation of inactive phases, is observed when the vanadium content exceeds the theoretical monolayer coverage, as seen in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or other reduced V3+/V4+ phases. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can mitigate deactivation. Reoxidation with O2 is generally effective for regenerating Cr-based catalysts, while CO2 can be used to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by reducing the extent of carbon deposition and regenerating active vanadia species. However, the effectiveness of these methods depends on the temperature requirements and the impact on catalytic performance, which varies depending on the specific catalyst and the reaction conditions.

在氧化脱氢化过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括碳沉积和过氧化。碳沉积发生在酸性硅支持作用下，特别是当吸附中间体的催化剂表面时，尤其是在较低的钒表面覆盖度下。过氧化导致形成无活性相，观察到当钒含量超过理论单层覆盖率时，表面形成表面Na五氧化二钒或其它还原的V3+/V4+相。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，可以缓解失活。对于Cr基催化剂，使用O2进行再氧化通常效果较好。而对于VOx催化反应，通过减少碳沉积的范围和重新生成活性钒相，使用CO2可以缓解过氧化。然而，这些方法的有效性取决于温度要求和对催化性能的影响，这取决于具体的催化剂和反应条件。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of surface Na metavanadate or other reduced V3+/V4+ phases upon promotion with Na+. These formations lead to a loss of catalytic activity. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, aim to restore the catalyst's functionality by reverting the reduced phases back to their active states. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, thereby preserving the catalyst's activity.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of surface phases that lack catalytic activity. In the case of VOx catalysts, promotion with Na+ significantly improved dispersion of VOx species but led to the formation of surface Na metavanadate, which lacks catalytic activity. Similarly, the addition of Na resulted in the formation of Na metavanadate, which is inactive in propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective depending on the specific catalyst type and deactivation mechanism. CO2 addition might mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing an alternative oxidant, potentially improving catalytic performance.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的失活主要原因是表面形成缺乏催化活性的相。对于VOx催化剂，Na+的促进显著提高了VOx物种的分散性，但导致了表面Na metavanadate的形成，这在丙烷氧化脱氢中缺乏活性。同样，Na的添加导致了Na metavanadate的形成，这在CO2存在的丙烷氧化脱氢中缺乏活性。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，根据具体的催化剂类型和失活机制，可以有效。CO2的添加可能通过提供替代氧化剂来减轻VOx催化的过氧化，从而改善催化性能。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve the alteration of the redox behavior of surface species, leading to the prevention of key oxidation states required for efficient activation of reactants. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, though its effectiveness and the optimal conditions for its application require further investigation. The formation of Na metavanadate or a reduced V3+/V4+ phase upon promotion with Na+ results in the loss of catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of controlling the redox state and dispersion of active species on the catalyst surface.

1. The primary cause of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is often attributed to overoxidation and the subsequent formation of inactive compounds. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the active sites of the catalysts. In the context of this study, the addition of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions was observed to be effective in reducing the extent of carbon deposition, thereby preserving the catalytic performance. The effectiveness of these methods varies based on the specific conditions, such as temperature and the type of catalyst involved.

2. In terms of effectiveness, reoxidation with O2 is generally more aggressive and can lead to the regeneration of active sites but might also result in higher overoxidation and thus potentially lower performance over time. Reoxidation with CO2, on the other hand, can be gentler and more selective, offering a balance between regenerating active sites and minimizing overoxidation. Air reoxidation is typically the least selective and could lead to the formation of more inactive compounds. The temperature requirements for these methods depend on the specific catalyst and the extent of deactivation. Higher temperatures can enhance the regeneration process but might also increase the risk of overoxidation.

3. The comparison of regeneration methods in terms of temperature requirements indicates that CO2 reoxidation can operate at moderate temperatures, making it a viable option for catalysts that require lower activation temperatures. Air reoxidation might be more suitable for catalysts that can withstand higher temperatures without significant deactivation. O2 reoxidation, while effective, might necessitate careful control of the process to avoid excessive overoxidation, especially at higher temperatures.

4. The impact on catalytic performance depends on the efficiency of the regeneration method in restoring the active sites while avoiding overoxidation. The study found that CO2 addition helped in reducing carbon deposition, which is a common cause of deactivation in VOx catalysts. This suggests that CO2 can be beneficial in maintaining the catalytic performance by preventing the accumulation of inactive compounds on the surface of the catalyst.

5. The confirmation of improved vanadium dispersion in the presence of Na+ was achieved through EDS elemental mapping. This method provides direct evidence of the spatial distribution of elements within the catalyst, which is crucial for understanding the mechanism of Na+ promotion. It demonstrates that Na+ can enhance the dispersion of vanadia species, leading to better catalyst performance. The presence of Na+ also affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, impacting their ability to regenerate to the V5+ oxidation state, which is essential for propane activation.

1. 在氧化脱氢反应过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（尤其是Cr基和VOx催化剂）的主要失效原因是过氧化和随后形成的无活性化合物。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，旨在恢复催化剂的活性位点。研究中观察到，通过向VOx催化反应中添加CO2来减轻过氧化，可以有效减少碳沉积，从而保持催化剂性能。这些方法的有效性取决于特定条件，例如温度和所用催化剂的类型。

2. 从有效性来看，O2再氧化通常更为强烈，能够更有效地恢复活性位点，但同时也可能导致更高的过氧化，并可能降低催化剂性能。与之相比，使用CO2进行再氧化可以更为温和且更具选择性，提供在恢复活性位点的同时避免过氧化的平衡。空气再氧化通常是最不选择性的，可能会形成更多无活性化合物，特别是对于需要较高激活温度的催化剂。温度要求因催化剂的具体特性和失活程度而异。较高的温度可以增强再生过程，但也增加了过氧化的风险。

3. 再生方法在温度需求方面的比较显示，使用CO2进行再氧化可以在较温和的温度下操作，这使其成为活性温度较低的催化剂的一个可行选项。空气再氧化可能更适合那些可以承受更高温度而不显著失活的催化剂。O2再氧化虽然有效，但在操作时需要小心控制，以避免在较高温度下过度过氧化，尤其是在存在更多无活性化合物积累的情况下。

4. 再生方法对催化剂性能的影响取决于其在恢复活性位点的同时避免过氧化的能力。研究发现，CO2的加入有助于减少碳沉积，这是VOx催化剂常见的失活原因。这表明CO2可以通过防止表面催化剂积聚无活性化合物来维持催化剂性能。

5. 通过EDS元素映射证实了Na+的存在提高了vanadia物种的分散度。这种方法直接提供了催化剂内元素分布的证据，这对于理解Na+促进机制至关重要。它表明Na+可以提高vanadia物种的分散度，从而提高催化剂性能。Na+的存在也影响了表面VOx物种的还原行为，影响其重新氧化为V5+氧化状态的能力，这对于丙烷激活至关重要。
