[1] "Promotion with Na+ significantly improved the dispersion of VOx species but resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate, which lacked catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[2] "However, the behavior of Na-promoted vanadia catalysts in propane ODH by CO2 has not been investigated."
[3] "The addition of Na resulted in the appearance of Raman peaks at 506, 637, 914, and 950 cm1 associated with the presence of Na metavanadate instead of 2D or 3D vanadia."
[4] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of surface Na metavanadate or other reduced V3+/V4+ phases upon promotion with Na+. These formations lead to a loss of catalytic activity. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, aim to restore the catalyst's functionality by reverting the reduced phases back to their active states. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, thereby preserving the catalyst's activity.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因是Na+促进下表面形成Na多钒酸盐或其它还原的V3+/V4+相。这些形成导致催化活性丧失。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，旨在通过将还原相恢复为活性状态来恢复催化剂的功能性。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，从而保持催化剂的活性。
