[1] "Promotion with Na+ significantly improved the dispersion of VOx species but resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate, which lacked catalytic activity in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[2] "The presence of Na+ is believed to adversely affect the redox behavior of surface VOx species, which prevents the regeneration of the V5+ oxidation state important for propane activation."
[3] "Na-promoted silica supports were employed to improve surface dispersion of 2D VOx species."
[4] "Promotion with Na cations significantly improved the dispersion of surface VOx species and resulted in the formation of surface Na metavanadate or another reduced V3+/V4+ phase, which displayed no catalytic activity in propane ODH in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve the alteration of the redox behavior of surface species, leading to the prevention of key oxidation states required for efficient activation of reactants. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, though its effectiveness and the optimal conditions for its application require further investigation. The formation of Na metavanadate or a reduced V3+/V4+ phase upon promotion with Na+ results in the loss of catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of controlling the redox state and dispersion of active species on the catalyst surface.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是表面物种的还原行为改变，导致关键氧化状态的生成受阻，无法有效激活反应物。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的重新氧化，其效果、温度要求和对催化性能的影响各不相同。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，但其效果及其应用的最佳条件仍需进一步研究。Na+促进下形成Na单范德华酸盐或减少的V3+/V4+相会导致活性丧失，这强调了控制活性物种在催化剂表面的还原态和分散的重要性。
