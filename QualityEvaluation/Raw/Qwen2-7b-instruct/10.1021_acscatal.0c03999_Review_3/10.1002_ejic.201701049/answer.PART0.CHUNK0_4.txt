[1] "However, no reactions were observed over the silica support at relevant temperatures (600 C and below) employed in this study to investigate propane ODH reactions."
[2] "Moreover, while propane ODH in the presence of O2 and CO2 was investigated over silica-supported vanadia catalysts at 350600 C, significant propane conversion was observed only at 550 and 600 C."
[3] "The extent of carbon deposition varied with varying vanadium content, and two catalysts with near-monolayer coverage, that is, S2 (3.1 V/nm2) and S3 (4.1 V/nm2), showed much higher weight losses of about 45 and 20 wt.-%, respectively, while S1 (1.9 V/nm2, ca. 0.5 monolayers) showed almost no weight loss during TGA."
[4] "According to lrusta et al.,19 vanadate species react with Na+ cations present on the surface of the Na-promoted silica to form surface NaVO3-like compounds that are inactive for methane oxidation to formaldehyde."
[5] "Improved vanadium dispersion in the presence of Na+ was further confirmed by EDS elemental mapping."

1. The primary cause of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts during oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is often attributed to overoxidation and the subsequent formation of inactive compounds. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the active sites of the catalysts. In the context of this study, the addition of CO2 for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions was observed to be effective in reducing the extent of carbon deposition, thereby preserving the catalytic performance. The effectiveness of these methods varies based on the specific conditions, such as temperature and the type of catalyst involved.

2. In terms of effectiveness, reoxidation with O2 is generally more aggressive and can lead to the regeneration of active sites but might also result in higher overoxidation and thus potentially lower performance over time. Reoxidation with CO2, on the other hand, can be gentler and more selective, offering a balance between regenerating active sites and minimizing overoxidation. Air reoxidation is typically the least selective and could lead to the formation of more inactive compounds. The temperature requirements for these methods depend on the specific catalyst and the extent of deactivation. Higher temperatures can enhance the regeneration process but might also increase the risk of overoxidation.

3. The comparison of regeneration methods in terms of temperature requirements indicates that CO2 reoxidation can operate at moderate temperatures, making it a viable option for catalysts that require lower activation temperatures. Air reoxidation might be more suitable for catalysts that can withstand higher temperatures without significant deactivation. O2 reoxidation, while effective, might necessitate careful control of the process to avoid excessive overoxidation, especially at higher temperatures.

4. The impact on catalytic performance depends on the efficiency of the regeneration method in restoring the active sites while avoiding overoxidation. The study found that CO2 addition helped in reducing carbon deposition, which is a common cause of deactivation in VOx catalysts. This suggests that CO2 can be beneficial in maintaining the catalytic performance by preventing the accumulation of inactive compounds on the surface of the catalyst.

5. The confirmation of improved vanadium dispersion in the presence of Na+ was achieved through EDS elemental mapping. This method provides direct evidence of the spatial distribution of elements within the catalyst, which is crucial for understanding the mechanism of Na+ promotion. It demonstrates that Na+ can enhance the dispersion of vanadia species, leading to better catalyst performance. The presence of Na+ also affects the redox behavior of surface VOx species, impacting their ability to regenerate to the V5+ oxidation state, which is essential for propane activation.

1. 在氧化脱氢反应过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（尤其是Cr基和VOx催化剂）的主要失效原因是过氧化和随后形成的无活性化合物。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，旨在恢复催化剂的活性位点。研究中观察到，通过向VOx催化反应中添加CO2来减轻过氧化，可以有效减少碳沉积，从而保持催化剂性能。这些方法的有效性取决于特定条件，例如温度和所用催化剂的类型。

2. 从有效性来看，O2再氧化通常更为强烈，能够更有效地恢复活性位点，但同时也可能导致更高的过氧化，并可能降低催化剂性能。与之相比，使用CO2进行再氧化可以更为温和且更具选择性，提供在恢复活性位点的同时避免过氧化的平衡。空气再氧化通常是最不选择性的，可能会形成更多无活性化合物，特别是对于需要较高激活温度的催化剂。温度要求因催化剂的具体特性和失活程度而异。较高的温度可以增强再生过程，但也增加了过氧化的风险。

3. 再生方法在温度需求方面的比较显示，使用CO2进行再氧化可以在较温和的温度下操作，这使其成为活性温度较低的催化剂的一个可行选项。空气再氧化可能更适合那些可以承受更高温度而不显著失活的催化剂。O2再氧化虽然有效，但在操作时需要小心控制，以避免在较高温度下过度过氧化，尤其是在存在更多无活性化合物积累的情况下。

4. 再生方法对催化剂性能的影响取决于其在恢复活性位点的同时避免过氧化的能力。研究发现，CO2的加入有助于减少碳沉积，这是VOx催化剂常见的失活原因。这表明CO2可以通过防止表面催化剂积聚无活性化合物来维持催化剂性能。

5. 通过EDS元素映射证实了Na+的存在提高了vanadia物种的分散度。这种方法直接提供了催化剂内元素分布的证据，这对于理解Na+促进机制至关重要。它表明Na+可以提高vanadia物种的分散度，从而提高催化剂性能。Na+的存在也影响了表面VOx物种的还原行为，影响其重新氧化为V5+氧化状态的能力，这对于丙烷激活至关重要。
