          Metal oxide catalysts, especially Cr-based and VOx catalysts, often experience deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Various methods like reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are used to regenerate catalysts. Air reoxidation is effective but needs high temperatures, usually above 500°C. CO2 reoxidation is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4, not fully restoring to V2O5. Oxygen reoxidation efficiently restores full activity but also requires high temperatures. CO2 addition helps prevent overoxidation, maintaining VOx dispersion and enhancing propylene selectivity. Isotopic experiments and DFT calculations show that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation goes through direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water gas shift.

          特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂，在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂经常发生失活。各种再生方法，如空气氧化、CO2或O2的氧化，用于恢复催化剂活性。空气氧化有效，但需要高温，通常在500°C以上。CO2氧化效果较差，只能氧化到V2O4，无法完全恢复到V2O5状态。氧氧化效率高，可以完全恢复活性，但同样需要高温。CO2的添加有助于防止过氧化，保持VOx的分散性和提高丙烯的选择性。同位素实验和DFT计算揭示，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢经过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢，随后是逆水煤气变换。

          The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts involves oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4 and participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It is clear that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which is attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4 rather than V2O5. The amount of propylene and carbon monoxide must be equal in this process. CO and H2O are produced from CO2 and C3H8 through a redox mechanism during oxidative dehydrogenation. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reacting with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 for varying reaction times is three times less than when reacting solely with C3H8 for the same duration. Oxygen abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site, is a spontaneous process (DGr 600C = 74 kJ/mol). The first step of non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane is considered equivalent to the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) cycle. Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier across investigated catalytic cycles, propane dehydrogenation with CO2 can proceed equally through direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.

          在WOxVOx/SiO2催化剂上进行丙烷脱氢中，CO2的作用包括氧化V2O3为V2O4，并参与丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯。显然，CO2再生的交换氧不到一半，这归因于V2O3氧化为V2O4而不是V2O5。在这个过程中，丙烯和一氧化碳的数量必须相等。CO和H2O从CO2和C3H8通过氧化还原机制产生，期间发生氧化脱氢。在不同的反应时间内使用CO2和C3H8反应后，催化剂上的碳沉积量是仅用C3H8反应相同时间的三倍少。从CO2中提取氧，以再生活性位点的钒氧，是一个自发过程（DGr 600C = 74 kJ/mol）。非氧化脱氢（DH）的丙烷的第一步被认为与氧化脱氢（ODH）周期相同。基于调查的催化循环中最大的吉布斯自由能障碍，可以得出结论，在CO2存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和平行非氧化脱氢（DH）后接逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应进行。

          提高这个过程的产率可以通过添加WOx实现。不同于氧气，由于CO2的弱氧化能力，它不能将催化剂完全氧化回其原始状态。二氧化碳可以通过RWGS过程消除由非氧化脱氢反应产生的氢气。普遍认为遵循的途径与马斯-范克雷文伦机制一致。使用铬或二氧化钒基催化剂时，CO2可以重新氧化部分还原的金属氧化物。二氧化碳在某些部分氧化反应中的应用，如CO2重整甲烷和甲烷氧化耦合，已有记录。对丙烷在二氧化碳下的脱氢进行了热力学分析，采用的是约束吉布斯自由能最小化方法。然而，使用二氧化钒基催化剂的CO2辅助丙烷脱氢仍然不甚明了。基于调查的催化循环中最大吉布斯自由能障碍的分析，可以得出结论，在CO2存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和平行非氧化脱氢（DH）后接逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应进行。

          The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to grow significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are the main methods for olefin production, but they have drawbacks, including being endothermic and leading to coke formation. An attractive alternative is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen, which allows for lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation. Improving the yield of this process is possible with the addition of WOx. CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide-based catalysts. The high heat capacity of CO2 as a co-feed helps mitigate the exothermic effects of the ODP reaction, preventing hot spots that could cause alkane cracking. The catalyst with a W/V molar ratio of 0.1 has the highest average C3H6 turnover frequency, but higher selectivities were achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6. The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were determined using Arrhenius plots based on experiments conducted within a temperature range of 500°C to 600°C. The measured activation energies align with previously reported values in the literature.

          在不久的将来，对烯烃特别是丙烯的需求预计会显著增加。蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）是主要的烯烃生产方法，但它们存在一些缺点，包括吸热和产生焦炭。一种有吸引力的替代方法是使用分子氧进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODP），这使得反应温度更低并更有效地抑制表面焦炭形成。提高这个过程的产率可以通过添加WOx实现。CO2被发现在铬和二氧化钒基催化剂上促进了较低烷烃和乙苯的脱氢作用。CO2的高比热容作为共供体有助于缓解ODP反应的放热效应，避免可能导致烷烃裂解的热点。W/V摩尔比为0.1的催化剂具有最高的C3H6平均周转频率，而W/V比为0.6时获得了更高的选择性。催化剂的显性活化能通过Arrhenius图法基于在500°C至600°C的温度范围内进行的实验获得。本工作中测量的活化能与文献中报道的值相符。

          Vanadium oxide is recognized as one of the key compounds in metal oxide catalysis [69]. Improving the yield of this process is achievable with the addition of WOx. Unlike oxygen, CO2 cannot fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capability. Moreover, CO2's high heat capacity can help alleviate the effects of the exothermic ODP reaction, preventing hot spots that could cause alkane cracking. It is generally accepted that the process follows a pathway consistent with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [39], although dehydrogenation (DH) can occur concurrently with oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). For catalysts based on gallium and indium, the positive impact of CO2 is linked to its ability to enhance coke removal, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Nevertheless, the role of CO2 in assisting propane dehydrogenation with vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains poorly understood. Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600°C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is constrained by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, whereas CO2 re-oxidation of the catalyst occurs on a shorter timescale.
