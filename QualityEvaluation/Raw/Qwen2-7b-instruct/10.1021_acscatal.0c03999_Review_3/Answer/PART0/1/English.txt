The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, exhibit differing effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition is noted as a method to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, particularly affecting Cr-based and VOx catalysts. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been studied to restore catalyst activity. CO2 addition has demonstrated potential in reducing overoxidation during VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are effective for restoring most of the activity and selectivity. Oxygen at 600°C for 5 minutes can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke but decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be achieved with well-dispersed Cr species. The formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and stability. To overcome this, CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area can be prepared through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Controlling the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Proper synthetic methods provide solutions to this issue. For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation impedes achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites. Four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species.

Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is mainly caused by sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation.

Metal oxide catalysts, especially Cr-based and VOx catalysts, often experience deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Various methods like reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are used to regenerate catalysts. Air reoxidation is effective but needs high temperatures, usually above 500°C. CO2 reoxidation is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4, not fully restoring to V2O5. Oxygen reoxidation efficiently restores full activity but also requires high temperatures. CO2 addition helps prevent overoxidation, maintaining VOx dispersion and enhancing propylene selectivity. Isotopic experiments and DFT calculations show that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation goes through direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water gas shift.
