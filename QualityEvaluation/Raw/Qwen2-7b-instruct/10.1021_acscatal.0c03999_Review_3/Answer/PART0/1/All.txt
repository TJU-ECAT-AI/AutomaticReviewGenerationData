Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are effective for restoring most of the activity and selectivity. Oxygen at 600°C for 5 minutes can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke but decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be achieved with well-dispersed Cr species. The formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and stability. To overcome this, CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area can be prepared through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Controlling the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Proper synthetic methods provide solutions to this issue. For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation impedes achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites. Four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species.", "Chinese": "Cr基催化剂失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。在550-650°C的高温下使用空气或CO2进行再生可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。在600°C下用5分钟的O2进行再生可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，并且这种恢复在4个周期后可以重复。仅在第二周期使用CO2作为氧化剂可以实现完全恢复，之后无法阻止催化剂进一步失效。在CO2ODHP过程中添加O2有助于去除焦炭，但会伴随C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的大幅下降。完全恢复活性位点较为困难，但可以通过制备分散良好的Cr物种来实现。在较高Cr负载下形成不可活性的α-Cr2O3限制了活性并影响稳定性。通过直接一锅水热合成制备具有高比表面积的CrSiO2催化剂可以解决这个问题。控制Cr负载以维持独特的孔结构会牺牲活性。选择合适的合成方法提供了克服这一问题的解决方案。对于VOx基催化剂，过氧化阻碍了实现高C3H6选择性。在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2有助于减少表面分子氧物种，从而消除过氧化位点。反应期间存在四种类型的VOx物种：单钒酸盐、寡聚钒酸盐、多聚钒酸盐和V2O5晶粒。已知存在另一种红ox循环，如氧化金刚石支持的VOx催化剂上的V5+ V4+ 循环。对于以二氧化硅多孔材料为载体的VOx催化剂，短程有序的多孔结构和高度分散的VOx物种是理想的。", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3"},
