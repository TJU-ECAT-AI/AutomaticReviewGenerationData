          [20] "Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+OH) to bridge oxygen desorption of H2."

          [3] "For example, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."
          [4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
