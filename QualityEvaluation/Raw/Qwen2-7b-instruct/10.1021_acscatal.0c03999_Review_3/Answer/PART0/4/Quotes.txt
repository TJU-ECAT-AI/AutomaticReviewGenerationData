          [2] "Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) and dehydrogenation (DH) are the primary methods to obtain olefins."
          [3] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
          [4] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of surface coke formation."
          [5] "Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx."
          [6] "CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide based catalysts."
          [7] "Moreover, because of its high heat capacity,using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the alkane."
          [8] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
          [9] "The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were calculated using Arrhenius plots. These data were obtained from experiments performed at a temperature interval of 500 C to 600 C."
          [10] "The activation energies measured in this work are in agreement with those reported previously in the literature."
