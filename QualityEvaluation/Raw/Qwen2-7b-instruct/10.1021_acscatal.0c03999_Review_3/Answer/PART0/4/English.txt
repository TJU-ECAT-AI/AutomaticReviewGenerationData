The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to grow significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are the main methods for olefin production, but they have drawbacks, including being endothermic and leading to coke formation. An attractive alternative is the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen, which allows for lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation. Improving the yield of this process is possible with the addition of WOx. CO2 was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide-based catalysts. The high heat capacity of CO2 as a co-feed helps mitigate the exothermic effects of the ODP reaction, preventing hot spots that could cause alkane cracking. The catalyst with a W/V molar ratio of 0.1 has the highest average C3H6 turnover frequency, but higher selectivities were achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6. The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were determined using Arrhenius plots based on experiments conducted within a temperature range of 500°C to 600°C. The measured activation energies align with previously reported values in the literature.
