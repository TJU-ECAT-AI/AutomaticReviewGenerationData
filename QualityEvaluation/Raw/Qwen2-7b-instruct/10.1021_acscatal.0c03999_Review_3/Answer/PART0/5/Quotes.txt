          [3] "Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity."
          [4] "Moreover, because of its high heat capacity, using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the alkane."
          [5] "It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [39], but DH can occur simultaneously with the ODH reaction."
          [6] "For gallium and indium based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

          [8] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."
