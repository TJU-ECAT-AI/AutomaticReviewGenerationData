Vanadium oxide is recognized as one of the key compounds in metal oxide catalysis [69]. Improving the yield of this process is achievable with the addition of WOx. Unlike oxygen, CO2 cannot fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capability. Moreover, CO2's high heat capacity can help alleviate the effects of the exothermic ODP reaction, preventing hot spots that could cause alkane cracking. It is generally accepted that the process follows a pathway consistent with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [39], although dehydrogenation (DH) can occur concurrently with oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH). For catalysts based on gallium and indium, the positive impact of CO2 is linked to its ability to enhance coke removal, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Nevertheless, the role of CO2 in assisting propane dehydrogenation with vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains poorly understood. Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600°C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is constrained by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, whereas CO2 re-oxidation of the catalyst occurs on a shorter timescale.
