VOx, another redox-active metal oxide, has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, where overoxidation hinders the achievement of high C3H6 selectivity. Adding CO2 to the feed gas mixture of C3H8/O2 is a promising method, as it reduces the surface molecular oxygen species contributing to overoxidation by adjusting the adsorption-desorption equilibrium at basic oxidizing sites. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. For preparing VOx catalysts, mesoporous silica has been utilized as a support, offering high dispersion. However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, resulting in low catalytic activity. Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores and highly dispersed VOx species are preferred. Xue et al. successfully prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) as a support for VOx catalysts. By employing an oilwater biphase stratification reaction system, they achieved precise control over monolayer coverage, preventing the aggregation of V species into V2O5. After simple reoxidation in air, both conversion and selectivity could be fully restored.

Improving the yield of this process is feasible with the addition of WOx. Unlike oxygen, CO2 cannot fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. Carbon dioxide can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions through the RWGS process. It is generally acknowledged that the pathway followed agrees with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism. When using chromium or vanadium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides. The utilization of carbon dioxide in certain partial oxidation reactions, such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane, has already been documented. A thermodynamic analysis of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide was carried out using the constrained Gibbs free energy minimization method. However, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation with vanadium oxide-based catalysts is still poorly understood. Based on the analysis of the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally through direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.
