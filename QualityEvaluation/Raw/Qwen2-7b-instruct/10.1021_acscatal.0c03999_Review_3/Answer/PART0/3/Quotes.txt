          [VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity.]
          [Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites.]
          [Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst.]
          [Mesoporous silica has been introduced as support to prepare VOx catalysts with high dispersion.]
          [However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, leading to low catalytic activity.]
          [Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores with highly dispersed VOx species are desired.]
          [Xue et al. have prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) and used them as support for VOx catalysts.]
          [The catalysts have been prepared via an oilwater biphase stratification reaction system that allows the delicate control of monolayer coverage and prohibit agglomeration of V species to V2O5.]
          [Both conversion and selectivity can be completely recovered after simple reoxidation in air.]

[1] "Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx."
          [2] "Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity."
          [3] "Carbon dioxide can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by the RWGS."
          [4] "It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism."
          [5] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
          [6] "Utilization of carbon dioxide in some partial oxidation reactions,such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane has already been reported."
          [7] "A thermodynamic analysis of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide was performed using the constrained Gibbs free energy minimization method."
          [8] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."
          [9] "Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
