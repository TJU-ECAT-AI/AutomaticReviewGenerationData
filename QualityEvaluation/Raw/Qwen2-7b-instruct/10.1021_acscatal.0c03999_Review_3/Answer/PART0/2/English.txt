The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, especially for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve poisoning, sintering, and overoxidation. Different regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, were evaluated based on their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and influence on catalytic performance. CO2 addition shows promise in reducing overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include exposure to excessive oxygen leading to overoxidation. For Cr-based and VOx catalysts, regeneration methods involve reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. These methods have different effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition has been considered as a strategy to reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. High-temperature regeneration in air or CO2 is commonly applied, restoring most of the activity and selectivity. CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP aids in coke removal but reduces C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is difficult but possible with well-dispersed Cr species. Increasing Cr loading while maintaining high dispersion is essential for achieving comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial standards. However, the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and stability. To overcome this, CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area can be synthesized through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Controlling Cr loading to maintain unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Selective synthetic methods offer solutions to this issue. For Cr/SBA-1 catalysts prepared by IWI, the pore structure is preserved more effectively, reducing irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse.

Reoxidation with air is typically more effective than with CO2 or O2 due to higher oxygen availability, although it necessitates higher temperatures. CO2 or O2 reoxidation has lower temperature requirements, making these methods more energy-efficient. CO2 addition can help reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by offering an alternative oxidant.

Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is mainly due to sintering, agglomeration, and poisoning. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in effectiveness based on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. These methods generally require moderate to high temperatures, with O2 reoxidation needing the highest temperatures. CO2 addition can help reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by offering an alternative oxidant source.

The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts involves oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4 and participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. It is clear that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which is attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 to V2O4 rather than V2O5. The amount of propylene and carbon monoxide must be equal in this process. CO and H2O are produced from CO2 and C3H8 through a redox mechanism during oxidative dehydrogenation. The amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst after reacting with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 for varying reaction times is three times less than when reacting solely with C3H8 for the same duration. Oxygen abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site, is a spontaneous process (DGr 600C = 74 kJ/mol). The first step of non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane is considered equivalent to the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) cycle. Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier across investigated catalytic cycles, propane dehydrogenation with CO2 can proceed equally through direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.
