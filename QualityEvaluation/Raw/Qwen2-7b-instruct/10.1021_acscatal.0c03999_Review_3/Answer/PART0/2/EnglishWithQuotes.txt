Oxygen abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site, is a spontaneous process (DGr 600C = 74 kJ/mol). The first step of non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane is considered equivalent to the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) cycle. Based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier across investigated catalytic cycles, propane dehydrogenation with CO2 can proceed equally through direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015"},
