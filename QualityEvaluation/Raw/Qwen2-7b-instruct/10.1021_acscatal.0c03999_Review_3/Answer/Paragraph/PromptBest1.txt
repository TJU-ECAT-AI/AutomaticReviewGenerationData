Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ef501059k\], \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\], \[10.1021/acscatal.5b01679\], \[10.1021/acscatal.6b00893\], and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. 

        The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, exhibit differing effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition is noted as a method to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

        Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are effective for restoring most of the activity and selectivity. Oxygen at 600°C for 5 minutes can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke but decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be achieved with well-dispersed Cr species. The formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and stability. To overcome this, CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area can be prepared through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Controlling the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Proper synthetic methods provide solutions to this issue. For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation impedes achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites. Four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species.

        CO2 addition is being considered for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. It assists in preserving VOx dispersion and improving propylene selectivity. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation proceeds via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water gas shift. Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during reaction. Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS. V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2ODHP and DHP routes. Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+OH) to bridge oxygen desorption of H2.

Detailed analysis derived from the study referenced by \[10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047\] elucidates the primary causes of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts, specifically focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, as overoxidation. The effectiveness of various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, varies significantly, as highlighted by \[10.1021/ef501059k\]. CO2 addition is noted as a potential strategy to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, as discussed in \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\].

        An in-depth exploration of the deactivation mechanisms in Cr-based catalysts, as detailed in \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\], reveals that coke deposition and reduction of active sites are the leading causes. High temperatures, typically above 500°C, are required for effective reoxidation with air, as per \[10.1021/acscatal.5b01679\]. In contrast, CO2 reoxidation is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4, indicating its inability to fully re-oxidize to V2O5 state, as reported in \[10.1021/acscatal.6b00893\]. Oxygen reoxidation, on the other hand, efficiently restores full activity but also necessitates high temperatures, as indicated in \[10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047\].

        To optimize the performance of these catalysts, the preparation of CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, as described in \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\], presents a viable solution. Controlling the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure, although sacrificing some activity, is crucial to overcoming the issue of inactive α-Cr2O3 formation at higher Cr loadings, as suggested in \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

        For VOx-based catalysts, as analyzed in \[10.1021/acscatal.5b01679\] and \[10.1021/acscatal.6b00893\], overoxidation impedes achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas is a promising approach to mitigate overoxidation, as it reduces surface molecular oxygen species by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites, as explained in \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

        The regeneration of active V sites in VOx catalysts differs, with V3+ being reoxidized through dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration, as outlined in \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\].

        The integrative understanding of these findings suggests avenues for future research. By exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, future endeavors could focus on developing more robust catalysts that can withstand deactivation mechanisms, particularly through enhanced regeneration strategies and optimized catalyst preparation techniques. Potential areas of investigation might include the development of novel catalyst materials, the implementation of more effective regeneration protocols, and the enhancement of catalyst stability through advanced synthetic methods. The utilization of CO2 not only as a feedstock but also as an auxiliary agent in the regeneration process could lead to significant advancements in oxidative dehydrogenation technology, optimizing both efficiency and sustainability.

        The primary causes of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts, specifically focusing on chromium (Cr)-based and vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, are overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2), have different levels of effectiveness and require varying temperatures. CO2 addition shows promise in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

        To optimize performance and mitigate deactivation, strategies such as controlling the loading of chromium species, utilizing proper synthetic methods for catalyst preparation, and employing mesoporous silica supports are crucial. These methods aim to maintain the dispersion of VOx species, preserve the unique pore structure, and prevent the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3. Redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified as alternative approaches.

        For Cr-based catalysts, coke deposition and reduction of active sites are significant deactivating factors.

Controlling the chromium loading to maintain the unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Proper synthetic methods provide solutions to this challenge.

        In the context of VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation hinders efforts to achieve high C3H6 selectivity.

Alternative redox cycles and mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species.

        The review emphasizes the importance of considering the unique characteristics of Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. It highlights the need for further exploration into the optimization of regeneration strategies, the development of new catalyst materials, and the understanding of redox mechanisms involved in the reactions. Future research directions could focus on the integration of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation, the development of more stable and selective catalysts, and the enhancement of the overall process efficiency.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047], [10.1021/ef501059k], and [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/acscatal.5b01679], [10.1021/acscatal.6b00893], and [10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015]. 

        Metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium (Cr)-based and vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, often suffer from deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. The primary causes of deactivation include overoxidation, sintering, and poisoning. Overoxidation is a significant factor, leading to the degradation of catalyst activity and selectivity.

        Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2), have been explored to restore catalyst activity. Air reoxidation is effective but requires high temperatures, typically above 500°C. CO2 reoxidation is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4, indicating the inability to fully re-oxidize to V2O5 state. Oxygen reoxidation is more efficient, restoring full activity but also demands high temperatures.

        CO2 addition is considered as a potential approach to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. It assists in preserving VOx dispersion and improving propylene selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas of propane/oxygen mixtures enables a decrease in surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites.

        The formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and is detrimental to catalyst stability. To overcome this issue, researchers have prepared CrSiO2 catalysts through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, maintaining the unique pore structure while sacrificing some activity. Proper synthetic methods offer solutions to this challenge.

        For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation impedes achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites. Four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified.

        Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species, enhancing the overall performance of the catalysts. Future research could focus on developing new synthetic methods, optimizing the support materials, and exploring novel redox cycles to further enhance catalyst performance and stability.

        Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation, require careful consideration of temperature requirements and the effectiveness of each method. CO2 addition can be a viable strategy for mitigating overoxidation, but its application depends on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook:
        Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more selective and stable catalysts, optimizing the regeneration processes, and investigating the synergistic effects of different additives to improve catalyst performance. The integration of advanced materials science, computational chemistry, and process engineering techniques could lead to significant breakthroughs in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, enabling more efficient and sustainable production of valuable chemicals from hydrocarbons.

        Metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium (Cr)-based and vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, often suffer deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Overoxidation is the primary cause of catalyst deactivation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2), have been evaluated. Air reoxidation is effective but requires high temperatures, typically above 500°C. CO2 reoxidation is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4, confirming the inability to fully re-oxidize to V2O5 state. Oxygen reoxidation efficiently restores full activity but also demands high temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, helping to preserve VOx dispersion and improve propylene selectivity. 
        Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts. Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable. Oxygen at 600°C for 5 minutes can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke but decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be achieved with well-dispersed Cr species. The formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and stability. To overcome this, CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area can be prepared through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Controlling the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Proper synthetic methods provide solutions to this issue.
        VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction. Overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites. Four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species.
        An integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on utilizing more sophisticated synthesis techniques to tailor the catalyst's structure and composition for enhanced stability and activity, exploring novel regeneration strategies beyond traditional reoxidation methods, and optimizing process conditions to minimize overoxidation. The integration of CO2 utilization could be further investigated for sustainable dehydrogenation processes, aiming to reduce environmental impact while enhancing product selectivity. Future work could also delve into the development of catalysts with improved resistance to coke formation, possibly through the design of new materials or modification of existing ones to better withstand the harsh conditions of oxidative dehydrogenation.
