        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ef501059k\], \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3\], \[10.1021/acscatal.5b01679\], \[10.1021/acscatal.6b00893\], and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. 

        The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, exhibit differing effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition is noted as a method to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

        Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are effective for restoring most of the activity and selectivity. Oxygen at 600°C for 5 minutes can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke but decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be achieved with well-dispersed Cr species. The formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and stability. To overcome this, CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area can be prepared through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Controlling the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Proper synthetic methods provide solutions to this issue. For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation impedes achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites. Four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species.

        CO2 addition is being considered for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. It assists in preserving VOx dispersion and improving propylene selectivity. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation proceeds via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water gas shift. Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during the reaction. Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS. V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2ODHP and DHP routes. Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+OH) to bridge oxygen desorption of H2.

        An integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on utilizing more sophisticated synthetic methods to tailor the structure of metal oxide catalysts, optimizing their performance under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions. There is a need to develop more effective and environmentally friendly regeneration strategies that can prevent overoxidation and enhance the recyclability of these catalysts. Moreover, the integration of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation processes could not only mitigate environmental concerns but also improve the economic feasibility of these reactions. Potential avenues for future exploration include the development of catalysts with enhanced CO2 tolerance, the design of more efficient CO2 addition strategies, and the implementation of integrated systems that combine CO2 capture and utilization with oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
