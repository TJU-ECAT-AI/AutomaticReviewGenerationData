        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/ef501059k], [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3], and [10.1021/acscatal.5b01679]. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been evaluated for their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, with a particular emphasis on the role of CO2 addition in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. 

        coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts, leading to significant challenges in regenerating these catalysts to full activity and selectivity. High-temperature reoxidation methods, such as those using air, are effective but require elevated temperatures typically above 500°C. CO2 reoxidation, while less effective in fully restoring the catalyst to its original state, can mitigate overoxidation and preserve the dispersion of VOx species, thereby improving propylene selectivity.

        The regeneration of active V sites in VOx-based catalysts differs, with V3+ able to be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption pathway, contrasting with the regeneration process in the Diamond-supported VOx catalyst which follows a hydrogen migration path from the bridge oxygen to V3+. The use of CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 has shown promise in decreasing the surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites.

        Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species. This enhances the overall performance and stability of the catalyst. In contrast, the formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits the activity and stability of Cr-based catalysts, necessitating careful control of the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure while preserving activity.

        To overcome the issue of overoxidation and improve catalyst stability, various synthetic methods have been employed to prepare highly dispersed CrSiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis, which exhibit improved stability and activity compared to conventional methods. These catalysts can be synthesized with controlled pore structures, albeit at the cost of activity. The preparation of Cr/SBA-1 catalysts by the IWI method, compared to direct synthesis, has been shown to preserve the pore structure to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse.

        The primary causes of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts, particularly focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are overoxidation, sintering, and poisoning. Overoxidation is a critical factor that can lead to a loss of active sites and decreased activity. The use of CO2 addition as a potential strategy to mitigate overoxidation has been explored, showing promise in preserving the dispersion of VOx species and enhancing propylene selectivity. However, the effectiveness of different regeneration methods varies significantly, with some requiring high temperatures and others being less effective in fully restoring the catalyst to its original state.

        An integrative understanding of these findings suggests a forward-looking perspective on future research directions. Future efforts might focus on developing more efficient regeneration strategies that can effectively mitigate overoxidation without requiring high temperatures. Additionally, exploring the use of novel support materials and catalyst formulations that can enhance stability and activity under oxidative dehydrogenation conditions could lead to significant improvements in catalyst performance. The integration of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation processes not only aids in mitigating overoxidation but also aligns with environmental sustainability goals, making it a promising avenue for future research.

        Future research endeavors might concentrate on:
        - Developing novel synthetic methods that allow for the creation of highly dispersed catalysts with optimized pore structures, enhancing both activity and stability.
        - Investigating the synergistic effects of CO2 addition with other regeneration strategies to achieve enhanced catalyst performance under mild operating conditions.
        - Optimizing the support materials to better withstand overoxidation and maintain catalytic activity over multiple cycles.
        - Enhancing our understanding of the redox mechanisms involved in the activation and deactivation processes of VOx and Cr-based catalysts, paving the way for the development of more targeted and efficient regeneration protocols.

        These directions aim to leverage the insights gained from the current literature to push the boundaries of oxidative dehydrogenation technology, addressing the primary challenges associated with catalyst deactivation and regeneration, while also promoting sustainable practices.

        从参考文献[10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047]的深入研究中，综合理解源自[10.1021/ef501059k]、[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_3]和[10.1021/acscatal.5b01679]。评估了包括空气、CO2或O2在内的各种再生方法的有效性、温度需求及其对催化性能的影响，特别强调了CO2添加在缓解VOx催化剂反应中的过氧化作用的作用。

        焦炭沉积和活性位点的减少是Cr基催化剂失效的主要原因，这导致了显著的挑战，以恢复这些催化剂至全活动性和选择性。高温再氧化方法，如使用空气，是有效的，但需要的温度通常高于500°C。虽然CO2再氧化在完全恢复催化剂到原始状态方面效果较差，但它可以缓解过氧化并保持VOx物种的分散，从而提高丙烯的选择性。

        VOx基催化剂中活性V站点的再生有所不同，V3+可以通过脱附CO2吸附途径进行氧化还原，而Diamond支持的VOx催化剂的再生过程则遵循氢迁移路径，从桥氧到V3+的氢迁移，再到桥氧脱附H2。将CO2添加到C3H8/O2流中显示出缓解表面分子氧物种造成的过氧化的潜力，通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来调节过氧化作用。

        对于VOx催化剂而言，短程有序介孔结构的多孔硅支持物是理想的，它提供了高分散的VOx物种，从而增强了催化剂的整体性能和稳定性。相比之下，更高Cr负载下α-Cr2O3的形成限制了Cr基催化剂的活性和稳定性，需要精确控制Cr负载以维持独特的孔结构同时保持活性。

        为了克服过氧化和提高催化剂稳定性，已经采用了多种合成方法来制备通过直接一锅水热合成的高分散CrSiO2催化剂，这种催化剂与传统方法相比表现出改进的稳定性和活性。这些催化剂可以通过控制孔结构进行合成，尽管可能牺牲活性。通过IWI方法制备的Cr/SBA-1催化剂与直接合成方法相比，其孔结构得到更广泛的保存，显著减轻了由孔塌陷引起的不可逆失活。

        金属氧化物催化剂的主要失效原因，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括过氧化、烧结和中毒。过氧化是导致活性位点丧失和活性降低的关键因素。将CO2添加作为缓解过氧化的潜在策略显示出希望，不仅有助于保持VOx物种的分散，还能增强丙烯的选择性。然而，不同的再生方法的有效性差异显著，一些方法需要高温，而其他方法在完全恢复催化剂至原始状态方面效果较差。

        整合这些发现提供了一个向前展望的视角，指出未来研究方向。未来的努力可能集中在：
        - 开发新的合成方法，允许创建高度分散的催化剂，优化孔结构，增强活性和稳定性。
        - 探索CO2添加与其他再生策略协同作用的效果，以实现温和操作条件下增强催化剂性能。
        - 优化支撑材料，使其能够更好地抵御过氧化并维持催化活性多个周期。
        - 加强对VOx和Cr基催化剂激活和失活过程中涉及的氧化还原机制的理解，为开发更具针对性和高效再生协议铺平道路。

        这些方向旨在利用当前文献中获得的见解，推动氧化脱氢技术的边界，解决催化剂失活和再生的主要挑战，同时促进可持续实践的推广。
