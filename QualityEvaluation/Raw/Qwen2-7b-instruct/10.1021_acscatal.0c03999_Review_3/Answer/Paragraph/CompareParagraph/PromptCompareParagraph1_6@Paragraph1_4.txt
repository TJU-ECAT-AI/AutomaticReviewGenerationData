Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ef501059k\], \[10.1021/acscatal.5b01679\], \[10.1021/acscatal.6b00893\], and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, exhibit differing effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition is noted as a method to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation in Cr-based catalysts. High temperatures, typically above 500Â°C, are required for air reoxidation, whereas CO2 reoxidation is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4. Oxygen reoxidation efficiently restores full activity but demands high temperatures. CO2 addition assists in mitigating overoxidation, preserving VOx dispersion and improving propylene selectivity. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species. Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome issues related to stability and activity.
        
        
        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with improved resistance to overoxidation, optimizing regeneration processes to enhance efficiency at lower temperatures, and exploring novel supports or materials that can further improve catalyst performance. The integration of computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, could aid in understanding complex redox mechanisms and predicting catalyst behavior under various conditions. Moreover, the synergistic effects of combining different catalysts or using multi-functional materials might offer new avenues for achieving high selectivity and activity in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. CO2 utilization in the feed gas as a means to mitigate overoxidation and enhance propylene selectivity presents a promising direction for sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes.

Overoxidation is the primary cause of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts, particularly Cr-based and VOx catalysts, in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have different effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, as noted in reference [10.1021/acscatal.0c03999\_3].

        A comprehensive understanding and prospective outlook reveals that while current efforts focus on overcoming challenges such as coke deposition and overoxidation, future research might explore novel synthetic methods and materials design to enhance catalyst stability and efficiency. The use of CO2 in feed gases could offer a promising avenue for mitigating overoxidation, thereby preserving catalyst performance. Moreover, the development of advanced catalyst supports with tailored mesoporous structures could facilitate better dispersion of metal oxides, potentially leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on:
        - The integration of CO2 utilization in oxidative dehydrogenation processes to reduce overoxidation and improve product selectivity.
        - The development of multifunctional catalyst supports that can simultaneously address issues such as coke deposition and overoxidation.
        - The optimization of synthetic methods to ensure better dispersion of metal oxides and enhanced stability under operational conditions.
        - The investigation of alternative metal oxides and their combinations to broaden the scope of oxidative dehydrogenation processes and expand the range of target products.

        The future of oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts is poised at the intersection of materials science, process engineering, and environmental sustainability, presenting exciting opportunities for innovation and application.
