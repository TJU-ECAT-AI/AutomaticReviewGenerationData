Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.cattod.2019.06.047\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ef501059k\], \[10.1021/acscatal.5b01679\], \[10.1021/acscatal.6b00893\], and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, exhibit differing effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition is noted as a method to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation in Cr-based catalysts. High temperatures, typically above 500°C, are required for air reoxidation, whereas CO2 reoxidation is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4. Oxygen reoxidation efficiently restores full activity but demands high temperatures. CO2 addition assists in mitigating overoxidation, preserving VOx dispersion and improving propylene selectivity. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species. Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome issues related to stability and activity.
        
        
        
        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing catalysts with improved resistance to overoxidation, optimizing regeneration processes to enhance efficiency at lower temperatures, and exploring novel supports or materials that can further improve catalyst performance. The integration of computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, could aid in understanding complex redox mechanisms and predicting catalyst behavior under various conditions. Moreover, the synergistic effects of combining different catalysts or using multi-functional materials might offer new avenues for achieving high selectivity and activity in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. CO2 utilization in the feed gas as a means to mitigate overoxidation and enhance propylene selectivity presents a promising direction for sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical processes.

3.1.1.5. Deactivation and Regeneration
Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts. Coking is relatively easier to reverse by reoxidation; moreover, the presence of CO2 can help to remove coke in situ through a reverse Boudouard reaction or to inhibit the coking process. (73) Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550&ndash;650 °C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable. For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 °C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles. (67) Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation. Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2&ndash;ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2&ndash;C3 olefin selectivity. (55)
By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species. As aforementioned (section 3.1.1.4), Baek et al. have introduced a (N0Mn+)I0 pathway to prepare MSU-x-supported Cr catalysts with highly dispersed Cr species. (69) The activity can be completely recovered under simple oxidation in air at 650 °C, retaining its repeatability after 6 cycles.
From a practical point of view, increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is necessary to attain comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial requirements. However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability. To overcome this issue, Botavina et al. have prepared highly dispersed Cr&ndash;SiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. (21) By following the procedure of MCM-41 synthesis, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit MCM-41-type mesoporous structure with high surface area (600&ndash;1000 m2 g&ndash;1). Long-term tests demonstrate better stability of Cr2.0&ndash;SiO2 in C3H8 conversion after 900 min on stream in the joint presence of CO2 and O2 (Figure 6A), but accompanied by a lower C3H6 yield than the other reaction conditions (Figure 6B). The improved stability originates from the trade-off between the reduced C3H6 yield and increased C2H4 yield (Table 2). Notably, a relatively well-retained yield is obtained under the condition of CO2 alone (Figure 6B). Spectroscopic studies (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) reveal that the average oxidation state of Cr in CO2&ndash;ODHP is 2+, which is lower than that (i.e., Cr3+) in the presence of co-fed O2. This is indicative of a lower probability of forming crystalline α-Cr2O3 if CO2 is the only oxidant. Apparently, the combination of the soft oxidant CO2 and well-dispersed Cr species in the 3D pore structure with high surface area is effective in avoiding fast deactivation and in prolonging the catalyst lifetime.
As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, the unique pore structure and large surface area of mesoporous support materials are effective in confining the growth of Cr species and affecting dispersion and structure of Cr species. However, the preservation of pore structure and porosity under reaction conditions is challenging. Michorczyk et al. find that the irreversible degradation of the pore structure after multiple cycles leads to decreased selectivity on Cr0.04-SBA-1. (66) An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity. Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue. Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI. (59) Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse.
3.1.2. Vanadium(V)-Based Catalysts
3.1.2.1. Identification of Active V Sites and Redox Cycle
VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2&ndash;ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity. Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts. Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption&ndash;desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. (107,108)
Similar to CrOx, catalytic performance of VOx depends on its structure, dispersion, and interaction with the support. (1) Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during reaction, including monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. (77,109)Figure 7 illustrates the evolution of surface VOx configurations as a function of surface V density on VOx/Al2O3. Monovanadate VOx species are proposed as active sites (see Table 3 for monolayer surface density on various metal oxide supports). The oxygen of V═O (vanadyl) groups of the monomeric VOx species are reported to account for propylene formation. (115) As the vanadia surface density increases, oligomeric species appear to emerge and are considered more active for propylene synthesis than the monomeric species. (77) Bulk V2O5 favors overoxidation, thus reducing C3H6 selectivity. (77,110,111) Noteworthily, there is another type of proposed active site at submonolayer V coverages, in which the bridging V&ndash;O-support bond is critical for O2&ndash;ODHP. (1) Its strength appears to associate to the ODHP reaction kinetics, as evidenced from the variations in apparent activation energy among vanadium catalysts supported on NbO5, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2, and TiO2. However, this scenario is scarcely reported in CO2&ndash;ODHP.
Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4. (28) Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+&ndash;O&ndash;V3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2&ndash;ODHP, DHP, and RWGS. (28) As illustrated in Figure 8, V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary C&ndash;H bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2&ndash;ODHP and DHP routes. Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ → hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+&ndash;O&ndash;H) to bridge oxygen → desorption of H2. In RWGS, V4+ sites are involved in H2 dissociation and water formation and desorption. CO2 dissociation also occurs on reduced V3+ sites, reoxidizing V3+ sites through oxygen abstraction. Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+ ↔ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst. (112)

3.1.2.2. Effects of Support
Mesoporous silica has been introduced as support to prepare VOx catalysts with high dispersion. (1) However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, leading to low catalytic activity. (113) Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores with highly dispersed VOx species are desired. Xue et al. have prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) and used them as support for VOx catalysts. (114) The catalysts have been prepared via an oil&ndash;water biphase stratification reaction system that allows the delicate control of monolayer coverage and prohibit agglomeration of V species to V2O5. The as-prepared catalyst displays higher C3H6 selectivity and comparable C3H8 conversion in comparison to other catalysts in Table 4. Both conversion and selectivity can be completely recovered after simple reoxidation in air.

Diamond is another form of carbon that can be a potential support candidate, because its surface can be functionalized with various surface oxygen functional groups (OFGs), such as C&ndash;O&ndash;C ether type structures and C═O carbonyl type structures, through oxidative treatment in acids (HNO3, HClO, H2O2, etc.) and oxidation in O2. (115,116) Nakagawa et al. have introduced oxidized commercial diamond as a support and conducted comparative studies among different metal oxides and support materials for CO2&ndash;ODHP. (112) Cr and V oxides supported on diamond display better catalytic performance than other metal oxides, including Ga, Mn, and Fe oxides (Table 4). Of note, the diamond-supported VOx catalyst outperforms Al2O3-, SiO2-, and activated carbon (AC)-supported VOx catalysts in terms of VOx surface area-based C3H6 formation rates.
3.1.2.3. Effects of Promoter
VOx/SiO2 possesses a lower monolayer coverage of VOx (∼3.3 V nm&ndash;2) compared to more reactive oxide support materials such as Al2O3 (∼7&ndash;8 V nm&ndash;2). (117) To enrich the surface VOx species with monovanadate and improve their retention against compression to form polymerized species or bulk V2O5, incorporating another metal component featuring a noninteracting nature offers avenues to achieve this goal. (30) Tungsten oxide (WOx) is known to influence the dispersion of VOx in this regard. (1,118,119) Ascoop et al. have introduced WOx into VOx/SiO2 catalysts for CO2&ndash;ODHP. (28) The highest C3H6 turnover frequency (TOF) is obtained at W/V = 0.1 molar ratio, while W/V = 0.6 achieves the highest C3H6 selectivity. The apparent activation energy (127&ndash;147 kJ mol&ndash;1) appears to be independent of W/V molar ratios, demonstrating that the WOx addition only preserves VOx dispersion rather than mediating active sites. Sandupatla et al. have carried out comparative studies among Cr2O3-, MoO3-, and WO3-modifed VOx/Al2O3 catalysts under a monolayer VOx coverage. (30) The catalytic performance of monometallic oxide catalysts decreases in the order of V > Cr > Mo > W (Table 4), and both Mo and W display poor activity. By sharp contrast, the mixed oxide catalysts V7Mo5 and V7W7 exert synergistic promoting effects on C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, especially for V7W7, while that synergy is absent for V7Cr4. Characterization results imply that these metal oxides are noninteracting with one another in the mixed oxides, and both VOx and CrOx are more readily reduced than MoOx and WOx. Another reason for the less synergetic effect on V7Cr4 originates from the improved CO2 adsorption on more reduced V and Cr sites, leading to CO2 poisoning. (30) To alleviate CO2 poisoning, a relatively higher but proper CO2 partial pressure is necessary to ensure more oxidized metal species for the ODHP reaction. Na-promoted SiO2 supports have also been employed in an attempt to anchor more monovanadate species with the surface Si&ndash;O&ndash;Na+. (120) Characterization results confirm the improved surface V density, but along with the formation of inactive Na metavanadate species that selectively produce CO instead of C3H6 (Table 4).
