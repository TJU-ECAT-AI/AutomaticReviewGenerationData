        Detailed analysis derived from the study referenced \[1\], which underscores the primary causes of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts, notably Cr-based and VOx catalysts, as being overoxidation. The efficacy and temperature requirements of various regeneration techniques, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, are noted to vary significantly, with CO2 addition being identified as a potential strategy to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. As highlighted in references \[2\] and \[3\], temperature requirements for these regeneration methods differ considerably.

        It is noteworthy that coke deposition and reduction of active sites are pivotal reasons for deactivation in Cr-based catalysts, with effective regeneration methods employing air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) typically enabling the recovery of most of the activity and selectivity. An illustrative case demonstrates that oxygen reoxidation at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. However, using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. The addition of O2 in CO2ODHP facilitates the removal of coke but comes at the cost of decreased C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity.

        For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation continues to pose a challenge in achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas stream is deemed a promising approach, as it reduces surface molecular oxygen species, which contribute to overoxidation, by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified.

        Mesoporous silica supports are considered desirable for VOx catalysts, as they offer short-range, ordered mesopores and facilitate high dispersion of VOx species. Choosing appropriate synthetic methods to prepare catalysts is essential in overcoming issues related to deactivation and maintaining activity.

        In summary, the deactivation of Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is primarily attributed to overoxidation, coke deposition, and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, are employed to restore catalyst activity, with CO2 addition proving particularly effective in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Future research should focus on optimizing synthetic methods and exploring innovative strategies to enhance catalyst stability and performance.

        来自\[1\]的深入分析表明，金属氧化物催化剂（尤其是Cr基和VOx催化剂）的主要失活原因在于过氧化。不同再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2的重新氧化）的有效性和温度要求存在显著差异，其中CO2添加被认为是一种可能的策略来减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。根据\[2\]和\[3\]的参考文献，这些再生方法所需的温度要求各不相同。

        焦点在于，焦炭沉积和活性位点的减少是Cr基催化剂失活的主要原因。使用空气或CO2在较高温度（550-650°C）下的有效再生方法通常可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。例如，在600°C下进行5分钟的氧气重氧化可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，并且这种恢复在4个循环后可以重复。然而，仅使用CO2作为氧化剂只能在第二个循环中实现完全恢复，无法阻止进一步的失活。在CO2ODHP中加入O2有助于去除焦炭，但会伴随着C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的大幅下降。

        对于VOx基催化剂，过氧化仍然是提高C3H6选择性的障碍。在气体流中添加CO2被视为一个有前景的方法，因为它通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来减少表面分子氧物种，从而减轻过氧化作用。根据金属负载和支撑面积的比例，反应期间存在的四种类型VOx物种包括单钒酸盐、寡聚钒酸盐、多聚钒酸盐和V2O5结晶体。已识别出V5+ V4+周期作为氧化金刚石支持的VOx催化剂的替代还原周期。

        硅基介孔支持被认为是VOx催化剂的理想选择，因为它们提供短程有序介孔结构并促进VOx物种的高度分散。选择适当的合成方法以克服失活问题并保持活性至关重要。

        总结而言，Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢化过程中的失活主要归因于过氧化、焦炭沉积和活性位点的减少。各种再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2的重新氧化）被用于恢复催化剂活性，而CO2添加特别有效于减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。未来研究应关注：
        
        - 开发具有增强抗过氧化能力的新催化剂材料。
        - 探索不同再生方法之间的协同效应，以优化失活恢复。
        - 提高催化剂支撑上活性物种的分散性，以改善选择性和效率。
        - 扩大CO2在氧化脱氢化过程中的应用，不仅为了减轻过氧化，还可以将其转化为有价值的化学品或燃料。
        - 探索先进的计算工具和模型，以预测和优化催化剂性能下的各种操作条件。
        - 解决氧化脱氢化过程的环境和经济影响，包括开发可持续的原料和废物管理策略。

        文件的见解强调了氧化脱氢化过程中失活机制和再生策略的复杂性，突出了跨学科方法在推进这一领域发展的重要性。未来研究应致力于将这些见解转化为能够显著提升氧化脱氢化技术效率和可持续性的实际应用。
