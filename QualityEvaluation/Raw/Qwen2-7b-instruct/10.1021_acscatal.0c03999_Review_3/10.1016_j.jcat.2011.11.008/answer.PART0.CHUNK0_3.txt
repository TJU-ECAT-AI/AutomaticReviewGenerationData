[1] "From the EPR spectra and the TPR profiles, it was concluded that the presence of tungsten induces the formation of a surface oxide phase with intimate mixing between vanadium and tungsten oxide species instead of pronounced surface vanadium oxide island formation, which was found in the absence of tungsten."
[2] "It was also observed to increase the reducibility of the V component, which might favor the catalytic reaction."
[3] "The data suggest that vanadium and tungsten oxide species tend to create a mixed surface oxide phase and that the effect of tungsten is rather to prevent than to encourage island formation of the surface V oxide component."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The presence of tungsten in V2O5AWO3/TiO2 catalysts leads to the formation of a surface oxide phase with intimate mixing between vanadium and tungsten oxide species, rather than distinct vanadium oxide islands. This promotes the catalyst's activity by preventing island formation and increasing the reducibility of the vanadium component, which might favor the catalytic reaction. The tungsten tends to create a mixed surface oxide phase with vanadium, rather than encouraging isolated vanadium oxide islands.

钨在V2O5AWO3/TiO2催化剂中的存在导致表面氧化物相的形成，其中钒和钨氧化物种之间混合紧密，而不是明显的表面钒氧化物种岛屿形成。这通过防止岛屿形成并增加钒成分的可还原性来促进催化剂活性，这可能有利于催化反应。钨倾向于形成与钒混合的表面氧化物相，而不是鼓励孤立的钒氧化物种岛屿的形成。
