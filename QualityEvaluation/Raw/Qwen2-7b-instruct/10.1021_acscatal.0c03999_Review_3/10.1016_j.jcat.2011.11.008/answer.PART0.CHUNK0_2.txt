[1] "The promotional effect of tungsten is clearly visible: at all vanadium contents, the conversion curve of the tungsten-containing samples rises at lower temperature."

[3] "The presence of tungsten induces the formation of a surface oxide phase with intimate mixing between vanadium and tungsten oxide species instead of pronounced surface vanadium oxide island formation."
[4] "The EPR spectra of tungsten-free samples and tungsten-containing samples, all measured at 77 K, are compared in Fig. 3 on the same intensity scale."
[5] "In absence of tungsten, the isotropic singlet can be also discerned (Fig. 3a), but it is much less intense than in the tungsten-free catalysts."

1. The promotional effect of tungsten is evident, causing the conversion curve of tungsten-containing samples to rise at lower temperatures compared to samples without tungsten.
2. In the absence of tungsten, the hyperfine structure signal of isolated VO2+ can be fitted with similar parameters across all samples.
3. The presence of tungsten encourages the creation of a mixed surface oxide phase between vanadium and tungsten oxide species, rather than distinct vanadium oxide islands.
4. The EPR spectra of tungsten-free and tungsten-containing samples are compared in Figure 3, measured at 77 K, on the same intensity scale.
5. Without tungsten, the isotropic singlet signal is observable but significantly less intense than in catalysts without tungsten.

1. 钨的促进效应明显，钨含量样品的转换曲线在较低温度下升高。
2. 在没有钨的情况下，孤立的VO2+的超精细结构信号可以使用相似参数拟合所有样本（表2，物种1）。
3. 钨的存在促使形成由钨氧化物物种和钒氧化物物种之间紧密混合的表面氧化相，而不是明显的表面钒氧化物岛形成。
4. 图3显示了钨自由和钨含样品的EPR谱图，在77 K时测量，并在同一强度尺度上进行比较。
5. 在没有钨的情况下，可以观察到无向量信号，但其强度远低于不含钨的催化剂。
