[1] "Vanadium oxide is the active component, but due to its toxicity and its activity for undesired SO2 oxidation, its content is usually 62 wt.%."
[2] "WO3 is a promoter and stabilizer, typically with an amount of 10 wt.%, which is described to increase the activity, widen the temperature range in which the catalysts are selective and to stabilize their physical surface area."
[3] "There is remarkable agreement regarding the nature of the active sites for ammonia-SCR in V2O5/TiO2."
[4] "The promotional effect of the W component in these catalysts relies on various experimental observations. Thus, their acidity was increased in the presence of tungsten, which favors the ammonia supply for the reaction."
[5] "Tungsten oxide was reported to delay the loss of BET surface area and the transformation from monomeric vanadyl to crystalline V2O5 during aging."
[6] "It was also observed to increase the reducibility of the V component, which might favor the catalytic reaction."
[7] "The aspect most closely related to the above-mentioned concept of the active sites was, however, the suggestion that the W component occupying a significant part of the support surface enforces a closer proximity on the surface V oxide species encouraging thus the formation of the most active VAOAV structures."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, poisoning, and sintering. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation is effective for removing surface carbon deposits but may lead to partial oxidation of the catalyst, reducing its activity. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation, preserving the catalyst's structure and activity better than air reoxidation. Oxygen reoxidation is highly effective in restoring catalyst activity but requires high temperatures, which can lead to sintering and structural degradation. CO2 addition can be beneficial in mitigating overoxidation, as it can act as a scavenger for oxygen, preventing further oxidation and potentially enhancing the catalyst's selectivity and stability.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的主要失活原因包括过氧化、中毒和烧结。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，在其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。空气再氧化可以去除表面碳沉积物，但可能会导致催化剂部分氧化，降低其活性。CO2再氧化可以减轻过氧化作用，比空气再氧化更好地保存催化剂结构和活性。氧气再氧化在恢复催化剂活性方面非常有效，但需要高温，可能导致烧结和结构降解。CO2的添加可以在一定程度上缓解过氧化作用，因为它可以作为氧的捕获剂，防止进一步氧化，并可能增强催化剂的选择性和稳定性。
