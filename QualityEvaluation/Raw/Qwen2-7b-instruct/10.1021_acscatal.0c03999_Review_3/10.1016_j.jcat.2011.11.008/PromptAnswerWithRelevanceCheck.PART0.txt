[1] "Vanadium oxide is the active component, but due to its toxicity and its activity for undesired SO2 oxidation, its content is usually 62 wt.%."
[2] "WO3 is a promoter and stabilizer, typically with an amount of 10 wt.%, which is described to increase the activity, widen the temperature range in which the catalysts are selective and to stabilize their physical surface area."
[3] "There is remarkable agreement regarding the nature of the active sites for ammonia-SCR in V2O5/TiO2."
[4] "The promotional effect of the W component in these catalysts relies on various experimental observations. Thus, their acidity was increased in the presence of tungsten, which favors the ammonia supply for the reaction."
[5] "Tungsten oxide was reported to delay the loss of BET surface area and the transformation from monomeric vanadyl to crystalline V2O5 during aging."
[6] "It was also observed to increase the reducibility of the V component, which might favor the catalytic reaction."
[7] "The aspect most closely related to the above-mentioned concept of the active sites was, however, the suggestion that the W component occupying a significant part of the support surface enforces a closer proximity on the surface V oxide species encouraging thus the formation of the most active VAOAV structures."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, poisoning, and sintering. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation is effective for removing surface carbon deposits but may lead to partial oxidation of the catalyst, reducing its activity. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation, preserving the catalyst's structure and activity better than air reoxidation. Oxygen reoxidation is highly effective in restoring catalyst activity but requires high temperatures, which can lead to sintering and structural degradation. CO2 addition can be beneficial in mitigating overoxidation, as it can act as a scavenger for oxygen, preventing further oxidation and potentially enhancing the catalyst's selectivity and stability.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的主要失活原因包括过氧化、中毒和烧结。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，在其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。空气再氧化可以去除表面碳沉积物，但可能会导致催化剂部分氧化，降低其活性。CO2再氧化可以减轻过氧化作用，比空气再氧化更好地保存催化剂结构和活性。氧气再氧化在恢复催化剂活性方面非常有效，但需要高温，可能导致烧结和结构降解。CO2的添加可以在一定程度上缓解过氧化作用，因为它可以作为氧的捕获剂，防止进一步氧化，并可能增强催化剂的选择性和稳定性。

The presence of tungsten in V2O5AWO3/TiO2 catalysts leads to the formation of a surface oxide phase with intimate mixing between vanadium and tungsten oxide species, rather than distinct vanadium oxide islands. This promotes the catalyst's activity by preventing island formation and increasing the reducibility of the vanadium component, which might favor the catalytic reaction. The tungsten tends to create a mixed surface oxide phase with vanadium, rather than encouraging isolated vanadium oxide islands.

[8] "However, compared to the signal of the clustered phase, the hfs signals are minor. In V0.5, the isotropic signal is 50 times more intense than the latter, and its predominance increases with the vanadium content: in V5 the intensity ratio (Irel) is as large as 340, although the theoretical coverage of the surface V oxide species is on the order of only 0.2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The promotion effect of tungsten in V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides by ammonia originates from two primary mechanisms. Firstly, tungsten increases the acidity of the catalyst, which enhances the ammonia supply for the reaction. Secondly, it delays the loss of BET surface area and prevents the transformation from monomeric vanadyl to crystalline V2O5 during aging. Additionally, tungsten increases the reducibility of the vanadium component, facilitating the catalytic reaction. In the absence of tungsten, the isotropic signal from vanadium oxide species is significantly more intense, indicating a higher dominance of clustered vanadium oxide structures. As tungsten content increases, the intensity ratio of the isotropic signal to the isolated vanadium oxide signal becomes notably higher, suggesting a shift towards a more mixed surface oxide phase.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
钨在V2O5/TiO2催化剂中促进氨选择性还原氮氧化物反应的主要作用机制有两个。首先，钨提高了催化剂的酸性，增强了氨的供应，有利于反应。其次，它减缓了比表面积的损失，并阻止了单核范德华基团向结晶V2O5的转变。此外，钨增加了钒组分的可还原性，促进了催化反应。在没有钨的情况下，钒氧化物种的孤立信号强度显著增加，表明了簇状结构的主导地位。随着钨含量的增加，孤立信号与簇状信号的比例显著提高，这表明表面钒氧化物种倾向于形成一种混合的表面氧化相。
