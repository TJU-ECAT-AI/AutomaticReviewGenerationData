The promotion effect of tungsten in V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides by ammonia originates from two primary mechanisms. Firstly, tungsten increases the acidity of the catalyst, which enhances the ammonia supply for the reaction. Secondly, it delays the loss of BET surface area and prevents the transformation from monomeric vanadyl to crystalline V2O5 during aging. Additionally, tungsten increases the reducibility of the vanadium component, facilitating the catalytic reaction. In the absence of tungsten, the isotropic signal from vanadium oxide species is significantly more intense, indicating a higher dominance of clustered vanadium oxide structures. As tungsten content increases, the intensity ratio of the isotropic signal to the isolated vanadium oxide signal becomes notably higher, suggesting a shift towards a more mixed surface oxide phase.

钨在V2O5/TiO2催化剂中促进氨选择性还原氮氧化物反应的主要作用机制有两个。首先，钨提高了催化剂的酸性，增强了氨的供应，有利于反应。其次，它减缓了比表面积的损失，并阻止了单核范德华基团向结晶V2O5的转变。此外，钨增加了钒组分的可还原性，促进了催化反应。在没有钨的情况下，钒氧化物种的孤立信号强度显著增加，表明了簇状结构的主导地位。随着钨含量的增加，孤立信号与簇状信号的比例显著提高，这表明表面钒氧化物种倾向于形成一种混合的表面氧化相。
