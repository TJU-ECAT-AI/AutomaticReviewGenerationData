The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, typically include overoxidation, sintering, and coke formation. Overoxidation leads to the formation of metal oxides that are less active. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can restore catalyst activity, but their effectiveness varies. Air reoxidation is generally straightforward but may lead to significant sintering and loss of surface area. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation by providing a mild oxidant, potentially reducing coke formation. O2 reoxidation can be highly effective but requires careful control to prevent excessive oxidation and sintering. The choice of regeneration method depends on factors such as the specific catalyst, desired activity levels, and the type of deactivation. CO2 addition can be beneficial in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively oxidizing the catalyst without causing severe overoxidation, thus preserving catalyst activity and reducing the risk of coke formation.

在氧化脱氢过程中，以Cr基和VOx为催化剂的主要失活原因通常包括过氧化、烧结和焦炭形成。过氧化会导致金属氧化物活性降低。再生方法如通过空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化可以恢复催化剂活性，但它们的有效性有所不同。空气再氧化通常较为简便，但可能会导致显著的烧结和表面积损失。CO2再氧化可以通过提供温和的氧化剂来缓解过氧化，可能减少焦炭形成。O2再氧化可以非常有效，但需要仔细控制，以防过度氧化和烧结。选择再生方法取决于催化剂的具体类型、期望的活性水平以及失活类型等因素。在VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以有益于选择性氧化催化剂，避免严重过氧化，从而保持催化剂活性并减少焦炭形成的风险。
