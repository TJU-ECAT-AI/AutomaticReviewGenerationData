1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, which leads to the formation of less active compounds. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the catalytic activity. Air reoxidation requires high temperatures, typically around 500°C to 600°C, and can lead to the formation of less active compounds. CO2 reoxidation is more effective in preventing overoxidation, allowing for lower temperatures, typically around 300°C to 400°C, and maintaining better catalytic performance. Oxygen reoxidation also helps in regenerating the catalyst but might require even higher temperatures compared to CO2 reoxidation.

2. In the context of the document, the chromium loading affects the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. Higher chromium loadings increase the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface, enhancing the catalytic activity. However, beyond a certain point, such as 6.0 wt%, the formation of less active species like -Cr2O3 occurs, which decreases the catalytic performance. The presence of Brnsted acid sites, which are more abundant with higher chromium contents, can contribute to coke production, further deactivating the catalyst.

3. The document does not provide detailed comparisons of various regeneration methods' effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance specifically for VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, based on the context, it suggests that CO2 reoxidation might be more effective in mitigating overoxidation compared to reoxidation with air or oxygen due to its ability to maintain better catalytic performance at lower temperatures.

4. The document focuses on the development and characterization of Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by metal vapor synthesis for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It discusses the optimization of the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and obtaining highly dispersed chromium species on the silica surface. The formation of surface chromate species is associated with the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, which can contribute to coke production, especially at higher chromium contents.

1. 在氧化脱氢反应中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr和VOx催化剂）的失活主要原因是过氧化，导致活性较低的化合物形成。再生方法，如通过空气、CO2或氧气重新氧化，旨在恢复催化活性。空气再生通常需要较高温度，约500°C至600°C，并可能导致活性较低的化合物生成。CO2再生比空气或氧气再生更有效于防止过氧化，允许更低温度，约300°C至400°C，并保持更好的催化性能。氧气再生也有助于催化剂再生，但可能需要比CO2再生更高的温度。

2. 在文档的背景下，铬负载影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。较高的铬负载增加在二氧化硅表面分散的铬物种的数量，提高了催化活性。然而，在某个点以上，如6.0 wt%，形成较少活性的物种如-Cr2O3，这降低了催化性能。Brnsted酸中心的存在，随较高的铬含量而增多，可导致焦炭生成，进一步使催化剂失效。

3. 文档没有提供详细比较各种再生方法的有效性、温度需求及其对催化性能影响的具体信息，尤其是针对VOx催化的反应。然而，根据上下文，它暗示CO2再生可能比通过空气或氧气再生更有效地缓解过氧化，由于其在较低温度下保持更好催化性能的能力。

4. 文档专注于通过金属蒸气合成法开发并表征用于丙烷氧化脱氢的Cr/SiO2催化剂。它讨论了在保持单位Cr原子的活性的同时优化系统，并获得在二氧化硅表面上高度分散的铬物种。表面铬酸盐物种的形成与出现Brnsted酸中心相关，这些中心可能在较高铬含量时导致焦炭生成。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, typically include overoxidation, sintering, and coke formation. Overoxidation leads to the formation of metal oxides that are less active. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can restore catalyst activity, but their effectiveness varies. Air reoxidation is generally straightforward but may lead to significant sintering and loss of surface area. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation by providing a mild oxidant, potentially reducing coke formation. O2 reoxidation can be highly effective but requires careful control to prevent excessive oxidation and sintering. The choice of regeneration method depends on factors such as the specific catalyst, desired activity levels, and the type of deactivation. CO2 addition can be beneficial in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively oxidizing the catalyst without causing severe overoxidation, thus preserving catalyst activity and reducing the risk of coke formation.

在氧化脱氢过程中，以Cr基和VOx为催化剂的主要失活原因通常包括过氧化、烧结和焦炭形成。过氧化会导致金属氧化物活性降低。再生方法如通过空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化可以恢复催化剂活性，但它们的有效性有所不同。空气再氧化通常较为简便，但可能会导致显著的烧结和表面积损失。CO2再氧化可以通过提供温和的氧化剂来缓解过氧化，可能减少焦炭形成。O2再氧化可以非常有效，但需要仔细控制，以防过度氧化和烧结。选择再生方法取决于催化剂的具体类型、期望的活性水平以及失活类型等因素。在VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以有益于选择性氧化催化剂，避免严重过氧化，从而保持催化剂活性并减少焦炭形成的风险。

[1] "The presence of the Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of metal oxides such as Cr2O3 and VO2. These metal oxides reduce the surface area and alter the surface chemistry, leading to decreased catalytic activity. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation typically leads to complete restoration of the catalyst, but can also lead to overoxidation and loss of activity. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation by selectively removing oxygen without significant risk of further oxidation, thus preserving catalyst activity better. Oxygen reoxidation offers a balance between restoration and risk of overoxidation, depending on the conditions. The addition of CO2 during regeneration can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by preferentially removing oxygen species without damaging the catalyst structure.

Answer: The main reasons for deactivation of metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of metal oxides such as Cr2O3 and VO2. Different regeneration methods, like air, CO2, or O2 reoxidation, vary in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation fully restores the catalyst but risks overoxidation. CO2 reoxidation helps mitigate overoxidation, preserving catalyst activity. Oxygen reoxidation balances restoration and risk of overoxidation. Adding CO2 during regeneration can protect against overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是形成了如Cr2O3和VO2等金属氧化物。这些金属氧化物会减小表面积并改变表面化学性质，导致催化活性降低。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。空气氧化通常能完全恢复催化剂活性，但存在过度氧化的风险。CO2氧化有助于减轻过度氧化，通过选择性去除氧而不会损害催化剂结构，从而更好地保持催化剂活性。氧气氧化在恢复和过度氧化风险之间提供平衡，取决于条件。在VOx催化反应中再生时添加CO2可以帮助防止过度氧化。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are the formation of surface chromate species and the appearance of Brnsted acid sites. These sites lead to coke production and can initiate the deactivation of catalysts through a process called cocking. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique optimizes the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and enables the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high (6.0 wt%) loadings. Chromium loadings higher than 6.0 wt% do not increase the amount of active chromate species but introduce inactive -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface. This results in a decrease in the selectivity to propylene and ethylene, as these higher Cr contents promote the formation of coke-producing Brnsted acid sites.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因是由表面铬酸盐物种的形成以及出现Brnsted酸性位点引起。这些位点会导致焦炭的产生，并可能通过一种称为“cocking”的过程导致催化剂失活。不同再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化）在效率、温度需求和对催化性能的影响方面有所不同。在VOx催化的反应中，CO2的添加可以减轻过氧化。

金属蒸汽合成（MVS）技术可以优化系统，使其每Cr原子的活性最大化，并允许在高达6.0 wt%的负载下在二氧化硅表面上分散铬物种。高于6.0 wt%的铬负载不会增加活性铬酸盐物种的数量，但在催化剂表面引入无活性的-Cr2O3颗粒。这导致丙烯和乙烯的选择性下降，因为较高的Cr含量会促进产生焦炭的Brnsted酸性位点的形成。
