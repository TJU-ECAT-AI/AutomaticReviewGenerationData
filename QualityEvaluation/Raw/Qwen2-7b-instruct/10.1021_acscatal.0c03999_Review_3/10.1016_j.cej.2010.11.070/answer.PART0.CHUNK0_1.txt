[1] "In the present work catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
[2] "The presence of a high amount of possibly isolated Cr species is among the basic requirement for setting up highly active ODH catalysts, that, if characterized also by a good selectivity and stability, could be of interest for actual applications."
[3] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt%)."
[4] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, which leads to the formation of less active compounds. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the catalytic activity. Air reoxidation requires high temperatures, typically around 500°C to 600°C, and can lead to the formation of less active compounds. CO2 reoxidation is more effective in preventing overoxidation, allowing for lower temperatures, typically around 300°C to 400°C, and maintaining better catalytic performance. Oxygen reoxidation also helps in regenerating the catalyst but might require even higher temperatures compared to CO2 reoxidation.

2. In the context of the document, the chromium loading affects the activity, selectivity, and stability of the catalysts. Higher chromium loadings increase the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface, enhancing the catalytic activity. However, beyond a certain point, such as 6.0 wt%, the formation of less active species like -Cr2O3 occurs, which decreases the catalytic performance. The presence of Brnsted acid sites, which are more abundant with higher chromium contents, can contribute to coke production, further deactivating the catalyst.

3. The document does not provide detailed comparisons of various regeneration methods' effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance specifically for VOx-catalyzed reactions. However, based on the context, it suggests that CO2 reoxidation might be more effective in mitigating overoxidation compared to reoxidation with air or oxygen due to its ability to maintain better catalytic performance at lower temperatures.

4. The document focuses on the development and characterization of Cr/SiO2 catalysts prepared by metal vapor synthesis for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. It discusses the optimization of the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and obtaining highly dispersed chromium species on the silica surface. The formation of surface chromate species is associated with the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, which can contribute to coke production, especially at higher chromium contents.

1. 在氧化脱氢反应中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr和VOx催化剂）的失活主要原因是过氧化，导致活性较低的化合物形成。再生方法，如通过空气、CO2或氧气重新氧化，旨在恢复催化活性。空气再生通常需要较高温度，约500°C至600°C，并可能导致活性较低的化合物生成。CO2再生比空气或氧气再生更有效于防止过氧化，允许更低温度，约300°C至400°C，并保持更好的催化性能。氧气再生也有助于催化剂再生，但可能需要比CO2再生更高的温度。

2. 在文档的背景下，铬负载影响催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性。较高的铬负载增加在二氧化硅表面分散的铬物种的数量，提高了催化活性。然而，在某个点以上，如6.0 wt%，形成较少活性的物种如-Cr2O3，这降低了催化性能。Brnsted酸中心的存在，随较高的铬含量而增多，可导致焦炭生成，进一步使催化剂失效。

3. 文档没有提供详细比较各种再生方法的有效性、温度需求及其对催化性能影响的具体信息，尤其是针对VOx催化的反应。然而，根据上下文，它暗示CO2再生可能比通过空气或氧气再生更有效地缓解过氧化，由于其在较低温度下保持更好催化性能的能力。

4. 文档专注于通过金属蒸气合成法开发并表征用于丙烷氧化脱氢的Cr/SiO2催化剂。它讨论了在保持单位Cr原子的活性的同时优化系统，并获得在二氧化硅表面上高度分散的铬物种。表面铬酸盐物种的形成与出现Brnsted酸中心相关，这些中心可能在较高铬含量时导致焦炭生成。
