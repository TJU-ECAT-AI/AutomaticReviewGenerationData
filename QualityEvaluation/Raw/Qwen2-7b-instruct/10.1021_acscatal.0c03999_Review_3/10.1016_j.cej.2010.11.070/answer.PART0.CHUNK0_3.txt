[1] "The presence of the Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."
[2] "Moving towards lower frequency, the weak band at 1555 cm1,can be attributed to the NH2 mode of SiNH2 species formed by reaction of NH3 with strained SiOSi (and/or SiOCr) bridges."
[3] "The higher possibility of the increase of the amount of exposed Cr centres with the increase of Cr loading together with the observed increase of the formed SiNH2 species up to 2.5 wt% of chromium, monitors that by using the MVS method the higher dispersion of chromium species can be attained."
[4] "The initial propane conversion (x), selectivity towards olefins (S) and yield of olefins (Y) for the catalysts with the different chromium loading prepared by MVS technique in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 are reported in Table 2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of metal oxides such as Cr2O3 and VO2. These metal oxides reduce the surface area and alter the surface chemistry, leading to decreased catalytic activity. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation typically leads to complete restoration of the catalyst, but can also lead to overoxidation and loss of activity. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation by selectively removing oxygen without significant risk of further oxidation, thus preserving catalyst activity better. Oxygen reoxidation offers a balance between restoration and risk of overoxidation, depending on the conditions. The addition of CO2 during regeneration can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by preferentially removing oxygen species without damaging the catalyst structure.

Answer: The main reasons for deactivation of metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of metal oxides such as Cr2O3 and VO2. Different regeneration methods, like air, CO2, or O2 reoxidation, vary in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Air reoxidation fully restores the catalyst but risks overoxidation. CO2 reoxidation helps mitigate overoxidation, preserving catalyst activity. Oxygen reoxidation balances restoration and risk of overoxidation. Adding CO2 during regeneration can protect against overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是形成了如Cr2O3和VO2等金属氧化物。这些金属氧化物会减小表面积并改变表面化学性质，导致催化活性降低。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。空气氧化通常能完全恢复催化剂活性，但存在过度氧化的风险。CO2氧化有助于减轻过度氧化，通过选择性去除氧而不会损害催化剂结构，从而更好地保持催化剂活性。氧气氧化在恢复和过度氧化风险之间提供平衡，取决于条件。在VOx催化反应中再生时添加CO2可以帮助防止过度氧化。
