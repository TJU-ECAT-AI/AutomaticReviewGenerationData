[1] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."
[2] "The presence of the Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."
[3] "The selectivity to main product propylene was higher than 80% and as a main by-product it was produced another olefin ethylene."
[4] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
[5] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono-or poly-chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are the formation of surface chromate species and the appearance of Brnsted acid sites. These sites lead to coke production and can initiate the deactivation of catalysts through a process called cocking. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique optimizes the system in terms of activity per Cr atom and enables the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface up to high (6.0 wt%) loadings. Chromium loadings higher than 6.0 wt% do not increase the amount of active chromate species but introduce inactive -Cr2O3 particles on the catalyst surface. This results in a decrease in the selectivity to propylene and ethylene, as these higher Cr contents promote the formation of coke-producing Brnsted acid sites.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因是由表面铬酸盐物种的形成以及出现Brnsted酸性位点引起。这些位点会导致焦炭的产生，并可能通过一种称为“cocking”的过程导致催化剂失活。不同再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化）在效率、温度需求和对催化性能的影响方面有所不同。在VOx催化的反应中，CO2的添加可以减轻过氧化。

金属蒸汽合成（MVS）技术可以优化系统，使其每Cr原子的活性最大化，并允许在高达6.0 wt%的负载下在二氧化硅表面上分散铬物种。高于6.0 wt%的铬负载不会增加活性铬酸盐物种的数量，但在催化剂表面引入无活性的-Cr2O3颗粒。这导致丙烯和乙烯的选择性下降，因为较高的Cr含量会促进产生焦炭的Brnsted酸性位点的形成。
