1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is mainly due to sintering, agglomeration, and poisoning. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in effectiveness based on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions. These methods generally require moderate to high temperatures, with O2 reoxidation needing the highest temperatures. CO2 addition can help reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by offering an alternative oxidant source.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因是烧结、团聚和中毒。不同的再生方法，包括使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，其有效性会因催化剂和反应条件的不同而变化。这些方法通常需要中等到高温，其中O2再氧化需要的温度最高。通过提供替代氧化剂来源，CO2添加可以减少VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。
