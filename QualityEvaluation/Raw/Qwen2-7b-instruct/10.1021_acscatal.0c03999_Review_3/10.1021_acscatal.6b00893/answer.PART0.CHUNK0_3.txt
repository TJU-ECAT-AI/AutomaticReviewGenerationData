The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of surface oxides and the loss of active sites due to sintering. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The addition of CO2 to the reaction mixture has been explored for its potential to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因，特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括表面氧化物的形成和活性位点因烧结而丧失。各种再生方法，包括空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，已被比较其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响。已研究向反应混合物中添加CO2以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化的可能性。
