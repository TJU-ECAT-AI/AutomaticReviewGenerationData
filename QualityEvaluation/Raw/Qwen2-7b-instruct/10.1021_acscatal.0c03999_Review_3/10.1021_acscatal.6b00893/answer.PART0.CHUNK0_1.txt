1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can restore catalyst activity. Air reoxidation is less effective compared to O2 reoxidation because of its lower oxygen concentration. CO2 reoxidation can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, thereby maintaining the performance of the catalyst.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括烧结、中毒和过氧化。各种再生方法，如空气、二氧化碳或氧气的再氧化，可以恢复催化剂活性。与氧气再氧化相比，空气再氧化效果较差，因为其氧浓度较低。二氧化碳再氧化可以帮助减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，从而保持催化剂的性能。
