1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, sintering, and poisoning.
2. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 compare in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Reoxidation with air typically requires higher temperatures but may restore activity more efficiently. Reoxidation with CO2 can mitigate overoxidation, potentially improving catalytic performance, while reoxidation with O2 can lead to more rapid restoration but might also exacerbate overoxidation issues.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化、聚集和中毒，特别针对Cr基和VOx催化剂。
2. 不同的再生方法如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，在效果、温度需求和催化性能影响方面进行比较。使用空气进行再氧化通常需要更高的温度，但可能更有效地恢复活性。使用CO2进行再氧化可以缓解过氧化，可能提高催化性能，而使用O2进行再氧化则可能更快地恢复活性，但也可能加剧过氧化问题。

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can restore catalyst activity. Air reoxidation is less effective compared to O2 reoxidation because of its lower oxygen concentration. CO2 reoxidation can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, thereby maintaining the performance of the catalyst.
