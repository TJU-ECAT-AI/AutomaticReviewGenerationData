Metal oxide catalysts, especially in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, experience deactivation due to factors such as sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can effectively reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, enhancing catalyst stability and efficiency.
