[1] "This work demonstrates a new modification of the conventional chromium catalyst for the ODP reaction and its effects on catalytic performance."
[2] "The catalyst exhibits a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend as Ru loading increases up to 3 wt%. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst."
[3] "We show that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds."
[4] "When the Ru loading reached 3 wt%, C3H8 conversion was reduced to 4.5% with a selectivity of 39% to C3H6. The production rate ratio of CO to H2 was determined to be 2.76, which suggests that the reforming reaction (eqn (4) and (5)) of C3H8 with CO2 became dominant."
[5] "The regenerative property of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst was also tested in this work. After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered."

1. The main causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke accumulation and aggregation of Cr species. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 differ in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

2. A new modification of the conventional chromium catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was demonstrated, showing enhanced catalytic performance with an optimal Ru loading of 1 wt%. The modified catalyst exhibited a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend with a two-fold enhancement compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Adding a small amount of Ru to the catalyst helps activate CO2 and removes adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface, shifting the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction towards propylene production without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds.

4. Increasing Ru loading beyond 1 wt% leads to a decrease in propylene production rate and selectivity due to a large amount of adsorbed CO2 blocking propane adsorption and the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The reforming reaction becomes dominant.

5. The Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed high stability during the long-time test, with a high propylene production rate and selectivity. However, its activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失效原因包括焦炭积累和Cr物种的聚集。再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的氧化，其有效性和温度要求不同，并对催化性能产生影响。通过CO2添加可以缓解VOx催化反应中的过氧化。

2. 对于常规铬基催化剂进行的氧化脱氢丙烷（ODP）反应的新修改被证明是有效的，最佳Ru负载为1 wt%，展现出火山状的丙烯产率趋势，并且与未改性的铬氧化物催化剂相比，丙烯产率提高了两倍。

3. 添加少量的Ru到催化剂中能够激活CO2并去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，通过逆水煤气变换反应来改变直接脱氢反应的平衡，从而提高活性，同时不破坏碳-碳（CC）键。

4. Ru负载超过1 wt%后，丙烷转化率和选择性降低，原因是大量的吸附CO2阻塞了丙烷吸附，并且Ru的高活性导致丙烯和CO2的重整反应。重整反应成为主导。

5. Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂在长时间测试中表现出良好的稳定性，具有高的丙烷转化率和选择性。然而，在496  3 C下用CO2再生3小时后，其活性未能完全恢复。
