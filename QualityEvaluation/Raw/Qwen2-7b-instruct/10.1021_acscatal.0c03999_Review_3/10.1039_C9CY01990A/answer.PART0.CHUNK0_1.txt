[1] "When the catalyst is modified with a large amount of Ru (3 wt%), CO2 conversion increases, but both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity decreased."
[2] "This suggests that the deactivation of the catalysts was probably caused not only by coke but also by the decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation."
[3] "After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496 °C for 3 hours."
[4] "However, its activity could not be fully recovered."
[5] "Moreover, its activity after the reaction stabilized (after 50 min of reaction) was still lower than the last CO2-regenerated cycle."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke formation and decreased dispersion of Cr species due to aggregation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, compare differently in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition is noted for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. In the specific case described, after a long-time experiment, the catalyst was successfully regenerated in CO2 for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered, and its activity after stabilization was still lower than the last CO2-regenerated cycle.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，是焦炭形成和Cr物种分散度降低导致聚集。不同的再生方法，在有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。CO2添加被指出可以减轻在VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。具体来说，在长时间实验后，催化剂通过CO2在496°C下再生了3小时。然而，其活性无法完全恢复，并且在稳定后的活性仍然低于最后的CO2再生循环。
