[1] "The C3H8 conversion showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, which resulted in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst."
[2] "The H2 products from the direct dehydrogenation reaction could be easily removed by the RWGS reaction, and the main reaction pathway changes from direct non-oxidative dehydrogenation over the Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst to the two-step oxidative dehydrogenation (Fig. 5, middle) over the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst."
[3] "However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of coke and aggregation of Cr species. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
