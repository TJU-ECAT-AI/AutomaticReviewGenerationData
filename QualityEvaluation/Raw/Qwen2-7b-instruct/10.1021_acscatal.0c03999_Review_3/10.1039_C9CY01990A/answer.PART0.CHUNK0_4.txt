1. The addition of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction can promote the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides, whereas in chromium oxide catalysts, CO2 activation is difficult. With increasing Ru loading, the main reaction pathway changes from direct dehydrogenation to oxidative dehydrogenation, and then to the reforming reaction of C3H8 with CO2.

2. The deactivation of catalysts occurs due to the gradual loss of catalytic activity over time, possibly due to coke formation and the aggregation of Cr species. Regeneration in CO2 at 496°C for 3 hours was tested, but the initial activity was not fully recovered, and the activity after stabilization was still lower than in the last CO2-regenerated cycle.

1. 在脱氢反应过程中添加少量CO2可以促进SiO2负载的铬氧化物的活性，而在铬氧化物催化剂中，CO2活化较为困难。随着Ru负载量的增加，主要反应途径从直接脱氢转变为氧化脱氢，然后是C3H8与CO2的重整反应。

2. 催化剂的失活可能是由于活性成分逐渐丧失，可能由于焦炭形成和Cr物种的聚集。在496°C下通过CO2再生3小时进行了测试，但初始活性未能完全恢复，并且稳定后的活性仍低于最后的CO2再生周期。
