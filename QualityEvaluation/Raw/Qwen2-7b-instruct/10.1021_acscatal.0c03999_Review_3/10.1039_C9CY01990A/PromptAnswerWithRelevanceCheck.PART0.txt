[1] "When the catalyst is modified with a large amount of Ru (3 wt%), CO2 conversion increases, but both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity decreased."
[2] "The regenerative property of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst was also tested in this work. After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours."
[3] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."
[4] "Moreover, its activity after the reaction stabilized (after 50 min of reaction) was still lower than the last CO2-regenerated cycle."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke formation and decreased dispersion of metal species due to aggregation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition is particularly effective in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. In the context of Cr-based catalysts, CO2 regeneration can restore activity to some extent, although full recovery might not always be achieved, especially after long-term operation. The temperature requirements for effective regeneration vary, with CO2 regeneration often being preferred for its lower temperature requirement compared to air or O2 regeneration, which can cause overoxidation and deactivate the catalyst.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括焦炭形成和金属物种分散度降低，导致聚集。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。在VOx催化的反应中，CO2添加特别有效地防止了过氧化。对于Cr基催化剂，在CO2再生下可以恢复活性到一定程度，尽管长时间运行后的完全恢复可能不容易实现，特别是在CO2再生后活性仍然低于最后的CO2再生周期。各种再生方法的温度需求不同，CO2再生通常需要较低的温度，与可能导致催化剂失活的空气或O2再生相比具有优势。

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，是焦炭形成和Cr物种分散度降低导致聚集。不同的再生方法，在有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。CO2添加被指出可以减轻在VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。具体来说，在长时间实验后，催化剂通过CO2在496°C下再生了3小时。然而，其活性无法完全恢复，并且在稳定后的活性仍然低于最后的CO2再生循环。

[1] "The C3H8 conversion showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru, which resulted in a two-fold enhancement of C3H6 production rate compared with the unmodified silica supported chromium oxide catalyst."
[2] "The H2 products from the direct dehydrogenation reaction could be easily removed by the RWGS reaction, and the main reaction pathway changes from direct non-oxidative dehydrogenation over the Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst to the two-step oxidative dehydrogenation (Fig. 5, middle) over the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst."
[3] "However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2."

[1] "This work demonstrates a new modification of the conventional chromium catalyst for the ODP reaction and its effects on catalytic performance."
[2] "The catalyst exhibits a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend as Ru loading increases up to 3 wt%. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst."
[3] "We show that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds."
[4] "When the Ru loading reached 3 wt%, C3H8 conversion was reduced to 4.5% with a selectivity of 39% to C3H6. The production rate ratio of CO to H2 was determined to be 2.76, which suggests that the reforming reaction (eqn (4) and (5)) of C3H8 with CO2 became dominant."
[5] "The regenerative property of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst was also tested in this work. After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours. However, its activity could not be fully recovered."

1. The main causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are coke accumulation and aggregation of Cr species. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 differ in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

2. A new modification of the conventional chromium catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was demonstrated, showing enhanced catalytic performance with an optimal Ru loading of 1 wt%. The modified catalyst exhibited a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend with a two-fold enhancement compared to the unmodified catalyst.

3. Adding a small amount of Ru to the catalyst helps activate CO2 and removes adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface, shifting the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction towards propylene production without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds.

4. Increasing Ru loading beyond 1 wt% leads to a decrease in propylene production rate and selectivity due to a large amount of adsorbed CO2 blocking propane adsorption and the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. The reforming reaction becomes dominant.

5. The Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed high stability during the long-time test, with a high propylene production rate and selectivity. However, its activity could not be fully recovered after regeneration in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失效原因包括焦炭积累和Cr物种的聚集。再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的氧化，其有效性和温度要求不同，并对催化性能产生影响。通过CO2添加可以缓解VOx催化反应中的过氧化。

2. 对于常规铬基催化剂进行的氧化脱氢丙烷（ODP）反应的新修改被证明是有效的，最佳Ru负载为1 wt%，展现出火山状的丙烯产率趋势，并且与未改性的铬氧化物催化剂相比，丙烯产率提高了两倍。

3. 添加少量的Ru到催化剂中能够激活CO2并去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，通过逆水煤气变换反应来改变直接脱氢反应的平衡，从而提高活性，同时不破坏碳-碳（CC）键。

4. Ru负载超过1 wt%后，丙烷转化率和选择性降低，原因是大量的吸附CO2阻塞了丙烷吸附，并且Ru的高活性导致丙烯和CO2的重整反应。重整反应成为主导。

5. Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂在长时间测试中表现出良好的稳定性，具有高的丙烷转化率和选择性。然而，在496  3 C下用CO2再生3小时后，其活性未能完全恢复。

[1] "However, the addition of a small amount of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction,whereas the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides could be promoted by CO2."
[2] "The main reaction pathway evolves from one-step direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 to two-step oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8, and to the reforming reaction of C3H8 with CO2 with increasing Ru loading."
[3] "After the long-time experiment,the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours."
[4] "Moreover, its activity after the reaction stabilized (after 50 min of reaction) was still lower than the last CO2-regenerated cycle."

1. The addition of CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction can promote the activity of SiO2-supported chromium oxides, whereas in chromium oxide catalysts, CO2 activation is difficult. With increasing Ru loading, the main reaction pathway changes from direct dehydrogenation to oxidative dehydrogenation, and then to the reforming reaction of C3H8 with CO2.

2. The deactivation of catalysts occurs due to the gradual loss of catalytic activity over time, possibly due to coke formation and the aggregation of Cr species. Regeneration in CO2 at 496°C for 3 hours was tested, but the initial activity was not fully recovered, and the activity after stabilization was still lower than in the last CO2-regenerated cycle.

1. 在脱氢反应过程中添加少量CO2可以促进SiO2负载的铬氧化物的活性，而在铬氧化物催化剂中，CO2活化较为困难。随着Ru负载量的增加，主要反应途径从直接脱氢转变为氧化脱氢，然后是C3H8与CO2的重整反应。

2. 催化剂的失活可能是由于活性成分逐渐丧失，可能由于焦炭形成和Cr物种的聚集。在496°C下通过CO2再生3小时进行了测试，但初始活性未能完全恢复，并且稳定后的活性仍低于最后的CO2再生周期。
