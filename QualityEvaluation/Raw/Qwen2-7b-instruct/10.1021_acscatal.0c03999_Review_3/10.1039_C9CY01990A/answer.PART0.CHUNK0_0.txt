[1] "When the catalyst is modified with a large amount of Ru (3 wt%), CO2 conversion increases, but both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity decreased."
[2] "The regenerative property of the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst was also tested in this work. After the long-time experiment, the catalyst was regenerated in CO2 at 496  3 C for 3 hours."
[3] "ICP-OES analysis showed that there was no significant loss of Cr species during the long-time test."
[4] "Moreover, its activity after the reaction stabilized (after 50 min of reaction) was still lower than the last CO2-regenerated cycle."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke formation and decreased dispersion of metal species due to aggregation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition is particularly effective in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. In the context of Cr-based catalysts, CO2 regeneration can restore activity to some extent, although full recovery might not always be achieved, especially after long-term operation. The temperature requirements for effective regeneration vary, with CO2 regeneration often being preferred for its lower temperature requirement compared to air or O2 regeneration, which can cause overoxidation and deactivate the catalyst.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括焦炭形成和金属物种分散度降低，导致聚集。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。在VOx催化的反应中，CO2添加特别有效地防止了过氧化。对于Cr基催化剂，在CO2再生下可以恢复活性到一定程度，尽管长时间运行后的完全恢复可能不容易实现，特别是在CO2再生后活性仍然低于最后的CO2再生周期。各种再生方法的温度需求不同，CO2再生通常需要较低的温度，与可能导致催化剂失活的空气或O2再生相比具有优势。
