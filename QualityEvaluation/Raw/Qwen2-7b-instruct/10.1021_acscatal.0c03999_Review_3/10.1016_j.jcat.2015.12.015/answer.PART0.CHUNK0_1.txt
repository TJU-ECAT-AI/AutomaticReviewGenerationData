[2] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."

[3] "This clearly indicates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which can be attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 instead of V2O5."

[4] "In this case, the amount of propy- lene and carbon monoxide must be equal."

[5] "Clearly, CO and H2O are produced from CO2 and C3H8 during oxidative dehydrogenation via a redox mechanism."

[6] "The amount of carbon deposited on the cata- lyst after reaction with a mixture of CO2 and C3H8 at the different reaction times depicted in Fig. 9(b) is three times less than that which is deposited after reaction with only C3H8 for the same time on stream."

[7] "Interestingly enough, the oxygen abstraction from CO2, which regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site, is a spontaneous process (DGr 600C = 74 kJ/mol)"

[8] "As depicted in Fig. 13, the first step of the non-oxidative dehy- drogenation (DH) of propane was considered to be the same as in the ODH cycle."

[9] "Overall, based on the largest Gibbs free energy barrier along the investigated catalytic cycles, it can be concluded that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed equally both via direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and by non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."

1. The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over WOxVOx/SiO2 catalysts involves oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4 and participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and plays a part in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
3. CO2 re-oxidizes the catalyst to V2O4 instead of V2O5, regenerating less than half of the exchangeable oxygen.
4. The amount of propylene and carbon monoxide must be equal during oxidative dehydrogenation.
5. CO and H2O are produced from CO2 and C3H8 through a redox mechanism during oxidative dehydrogenation.
6. Using CO2, the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst is three times less than after reacting with only C3H8.
7. The oxygen abstraction from CO2 regenerates the vanadyl oxygen of the active site spontaneously.
8. The first step of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is the same as in the oxidative dehydrogenation cycle.
9. Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by reverse water gas shift, with the activation of the secondary CAH bond being the rate-limiting step.
