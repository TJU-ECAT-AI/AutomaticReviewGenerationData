1. Metal oxide catalysts, especially Cr-based and VOx catalysts, often experience deactivation during oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
2. Various methods for catalyst regeneration, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, are utilized to restore their functionality.
3. Reoxidation with air is effective but requires high temperatures, usually above 500°C.
4. Reoxidation with CO2 is less effective, only oxidizing to V2O4, indicating it fails to fully revert to the V2O5 state.
5. Reoxidation with O2 is efficient and can fully restore activity but also demands high temperatures.
6. CO2 addition helps mitigate overoxidation, preserving the dispersion of VOx and improving the selectivity for propylene production.
7. Isotopic experiments and DFT calculations demonstrate that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water gas shift.

1. 特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂，在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂经常发生失活。
2. 复原方法，包括空气氧化、CO2或O2复原等，被用来恢复催化剂活性。
3. 空气复原有效，但需要高温，通常在500°C以上。
4. CO2复原有一定的效果，只能氧化到V2O4状态，无法完全还原为V2O5状态。
5. O2复原效率高，可以完全恢复活性，但也需要高温。
6. CO2的添加有助于避免过度氧化，保持VOx的分散，并提高丙烯选择性。
7. 同位素实验和DFT计算表明，CO2辅助丙烷脱氢可以通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢，随后进行逆水煤气变换反应进行。
