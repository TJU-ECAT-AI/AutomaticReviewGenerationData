[1] "The demand for olefins, especially propylene, is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Although these methods are commonly used to produce alkenes, they have some disadvantages: they are endothermic and suffer from the production of coke."
[3] "An attractive alternative to this approach is the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane (ODP) by molecular oxygen, which enables lower reaction temperatures and more effective inhibition of sur- face coke formation."
[4] "Vanadium oxide is considered to be one of the most important compounds in metal oxide catalysis [69]."
[5] "Improvement in this yield is possible with the addition of WOx."
[6] "Unlike oxygen, CO2 will not be able to fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity."
[7] "Moreover, because of its high heat capacity, using CO2 as a co-feed can alleviate the effects of the exothermal ODP reaction, avoiding hot spots that can lead to cracking of the alkane."
[8] "It is generally accepted that it follows a proposed pathway which is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism [39], but DH can occur simultaneously with the ODH reaction."
[9] "For gallium and indium based catalysts, the promoting effect of CO2 is related to its enhancing effect on the removal of coke, the Boudouard reaction, and the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction."
[10] "Nevertheless, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation with the use of vanadium oxide based catalysts remains poorly understood."
[11] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

1. The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to significantly rise in the near future.
2. Endothermic reactions and coke production are common drawbacks associated with conventional methods for olefin synthesis.
3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane offers an appealing alternative, enabling lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of coke formation.
4. Vanadium oxide plays a crucial role in metal oxide catalysis.
5. Incorporating tungsten oxide (WOx) enhances catalyst performance.
6. Carbon dioxide, unlike oxygen, cannot fully oxidize the catalyst back to its original state due to its weak oxidation capability.
7. CO2's high heat capacity helps mitigate the exothermic effects of oxidative dehydrogenation, preventing localized hot spots that could lead to alkane cracking.
8. The Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism typically governs the re-oxidation pathway, though dehydrogenation can occur concurrently with oxidative dehydrogenation.
9. For gallium and indium-based catalysts, CO2 promotes reactions by aiding in coke removal, the Boudouard reaction, and reverse water gas shift (RWGS).
10. The influence of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation with vanadium oxide-based catalysts remains largely unexplored.
11. Based on density functional theory calculations, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, whereas re-oxidation with CO2 occurs more rapidly.
