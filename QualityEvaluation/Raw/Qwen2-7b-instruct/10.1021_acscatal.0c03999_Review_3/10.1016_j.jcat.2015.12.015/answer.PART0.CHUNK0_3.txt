1. The demand for olefins, particularly propylene, is anticipated to rise significantly in the near future. Steam cracking, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC), and dehydrogenation (DH) are the main methods for producing olefins, but these processes have drawbacks such as being endothermic and causing coke formation.

2. An appealing alternative to these traditional methods is oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) using molecular oxygen, which offers lower reaction temperatures and more effective prevention of surface coke formation.

3. The addition of WOx can improve the yield of this process.

4. CO2 has been observed to boost the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes and ethylbenzene over chromium and vanadium oxide-based catalysts.

5. CO2 can mitigate the effects of the exothermic nature of the ODP reaction, preventing hot spots that might cause alkane cracking.

6. The catalyst with a W/V molar ratio of 0.1 has the highest average turnover frequency for C3H6, while higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6.

7. The apparent activation energies for the catalysts were determined through Arrhenius plots based on experiments conducted within a temperature range of 500°C to 600°C.

8. The activation energies measured in this study align with previously reported values in the literature.

1. 在不久的将来，对烯烃特别是丙烯的需求预计会显著增加。蒸汽裂解、流化催化裂化（FCC）和脱氢（DH）是主要的烯烃生产方法，但这些方法存在一些缺点：它们是吸热的，并且会产生焦炭。

2. 一种有吸引力的替代方法是使用分子氧进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（ODP），这允许较低的反应温度并更有效地抑制表面焦炭形成。

3. 添加WOx可以提高这一过程的产率。

4. CO2已被发现能增强铬和二氧化钒基催化剂上低烷烃和乙苯的脱氢作用。

5. CO2可以通过缓解ODP反应的放热效应，避免可能导致烷烃裂解的热点，从而减轻这种影响。

6. W/V摩尔比为0.1的催化剂在C3H6的平均转化频率最高，而W/V比为0.6时可以获得更高的选择性。

7. 根据在500°C至600°C的温度范围内进行的实验，确定了催化剂的显性活化能。

8. 本研究中测量的活化能与文献中报道的值相匹配。
