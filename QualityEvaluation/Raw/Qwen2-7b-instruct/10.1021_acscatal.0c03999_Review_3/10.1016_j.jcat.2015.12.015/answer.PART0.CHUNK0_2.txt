1. The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) can improve the catalytic activity of metal oxide catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has the ability to oxidize vanadium oxide (VOx) to V2O4 and participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. However, CO2 cannot fully oxidize the catalyst to its original state due to its weak oxidation capacity. CO2 can eliminate the hydrogen produced by non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. This pathway is in agreement with the Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism. When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides. Utilization of carbon dioxide in partial oxidation reactions such as CO2 reforming of methane and oxidative coupling of methane has been reported. A thermodynamic analysis of propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide was conducted. However, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation with vanadium oxide-based catalysts is still not well understood. Based on the analysis, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed via both direct oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) and non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) followed by RWGS reaction.

1. 添加钨氧化物（WOx）可以提高金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的活性。二氧化碳（CO2）能够氧化钒氧化物（VOx）到V2O4，并参与丙烷的氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程。然而，CO2无法将催化剂完全氧化回其原始状态，因为它具有较弱的氧化能力。CO2可以通过反向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应消除由非氧化脱氢反应产生的氢气。这一途径与马斯-范克雷文伦机制一致。当使用铬或钒氧化物基催化剂时，CO2可以重新氧化部分还原的金属氧化物。利用二氧化碳在甲烷重整和甲烷氧化耦合等部分氧化反应中已被报道。对丙烷在二氧化碳下的脱氢进行了热力学分析。然而，使用钒氧化物基催化剂的CO2辅助丙烷脱氢仍然不甚明了。根据分析，丙烷在CO2的存在下可以同时通过直接氧化脱氢（ODH）和非氧化脱氢（DH）后接RWGS反应进行脱氢。
