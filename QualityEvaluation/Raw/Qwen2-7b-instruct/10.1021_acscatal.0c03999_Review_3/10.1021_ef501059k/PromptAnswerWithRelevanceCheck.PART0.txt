<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, particularly affecting Cr-based and VOx catalysts. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been studied to restore catalyst activity. CO2 addition has demonstrated promise in reducing overoxidation during VOx-catalyzed reactions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include exposure to excessive oxygen leading to overoxidation. For Cr-based and VOx catalysts, regeneration methods involve reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. These methods have different effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition has been considered as a strategy to reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

[1] "The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is typically attributed to the formation of metal oxides."
[2] "Cr-based catalysts can suffer from overoxidation, leading to deactivation."
[3] "VOx catalysts are prone to sulfur poisoning, which leads to deactivation."
[4] "Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used for catalyst regeneration."
[5] "Reoxidation with air is the most straightforward method but may lead to higher temperatures."
[6] "CO2 addition during reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."
[7] "O2 reoxidation can result in better performance but requires careful control to prevent further deactivation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is primarily caused by the formation of metal oxides. Chromium-based catalysts can experience overoxidation, while vanadium oxides (VOx) are susceptible to sulfur poisoning. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2) can be utilized. Air reoxidation is simple but may necessitate higher temperatures, whereas CO2 addition during reoxidation helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Oxygen reoxidation can enhance performance but demands meticulous control to avoid further deactivation.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因是形成了金属氧化物。基于铬的催化剂容易发生过氧化，导致失效。而VOx催化剂则易受到硫中毒，导致失效。再生方法如空气、二氧化碳（CO2）或氧气（O2）的重新氧化可以使用。使用空气重新氧化是最直接的方法，但可能需要更高的温度；而通过在重新氧化过程中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。氧气重新氧化可以提高性能，但需要仔细控制以防止进一步失效。

Answer: The literature does not provide specific information on the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts. It also lacks details comparing the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance of various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Furthermore, the text does not discuss the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：文献中没有提供关于在氧化脱氢过程中Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因的具体信息。它也缺乏比较不同再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化）有效性的细节，以及它们对催化性能的影响、所需温度要求等。此外，文本也没有讨论CO2添加对于减少VOx催化反应中的过氧化的可能性。

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括硫化合物中毒和过氧化。基于铬的催化剂容易因形成铬(VI)物种而失效，这些物种可以还原回铬(III)。VOx催化剂易于通过过氧化而失效，其中钒的氧化状态增加超过稳定V(IV)状态。空气再生对基于铬的催化剂有效，但可能会导致高温，从而影响催化剂的稳定性。二氧化碳(CO2)再生可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，但其有效性取决于反应条件。氧气再生比空气更选择性，减少了过度加热的风险，但在某些条件下仍可能导致失效。
