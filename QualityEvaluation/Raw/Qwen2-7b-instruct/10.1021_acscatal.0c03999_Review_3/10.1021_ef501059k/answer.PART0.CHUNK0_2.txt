1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is primarily caused by the formation of metal oxides. Chromium-based catalysts can experience overoxidation, while vanadium oxides (VOx) are susceptible to sulfur poisoning. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2) can be utilized. Air reoxidation is simple but may necessitate higher temperatures, whereas CO2 addition during reoxidation helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. Oxygen reoxidation can enhance performance but demands meticulous control to avoid further deactivation.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因是形成了金属氧化物。基于铬的催化剂容易发生过氧化，导致失效。而VOx催化剂则易受到硫中毒，导致失效。再生方法如空气、二氧化碳（CO2）或氧气（O2）的重新氧化可以使用。使用空气重新氧化是最直接的方法，但可能需要更高的温度；而通过在重新氧化过程中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。氧气重新氧化可以提高性能，但需要仔细控制以防止进一步失效。
