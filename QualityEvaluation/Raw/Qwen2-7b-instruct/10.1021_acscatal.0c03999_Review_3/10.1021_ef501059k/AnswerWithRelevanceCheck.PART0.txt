          [1] "Metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium (Cr)-based and vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, suffer from deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes."
          [2] "Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2) have been explored to restore catalyst activity."
          [3] "CO2 addition has shown potential in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."

      <English>
          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, particularly affecting Cr-based and VOx catalysts. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been studied to restore catalyst activity. CO2 addition has demonstrated potential in reducing overoxidation during VOx-catalyzed reactions.

          [1] "Metal oxide catalysts, such as Cr-based and VOx catalysts, experience deactivation during oxidative dehydrogenation processes."
          [2] "Regeneration methods for these catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2."
          [3] "The effectiveness of these methods varies based on temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance."
          [4] "CO2 addition has been explored for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."

      <English>
          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include exposure to excessive oxygen leading to overoxidation. For Cr-based and VOx catalysts, regeneration methods involve reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. These methods have different effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition has been considered as a strategy to reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
