[1] "Metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium (Cr)-based and vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts, suffer from deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes."
[2] "Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, carbon dioxide (CO2), or oxygen (O2) have been explored to restore catalyst activity."
[3] "CO2 addition has shown potential in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, particularly affecting Cr-based and VOx catalysts. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been studied to restore catalyst activity. CO2 addition has demonstrated promise in reducing overoxidation during VOx-catalyzed reactions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是铬（Cr）基和二氧化钒（VOx）催化剂，在氧化脱氢过程中会因过氧化而失活。再生方法，如使用空气、二氧化碳（CO2）或氧气（O2）进行氧化还原，已被探索以恢复催化剂活性。二氧化碳添加在减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化方面显示出潜力。
