1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is primarily caused by poisoning by sulfur compounds and overoxidation. Chromium-based catalysts are susceptible to deactivation due to the formation of chromium(VI) species, which can be reduced back to chromium(III). Vanadium oxide (VOx) catalysts are prone to deactivation via overoxidation, where the oxidation state of vanadium increases beyond the stable V(IV) state. Reoxidation with air is effective for regenerating chromium-based catalysts but can lead to high temperatures that may affect the catalyst's stability. Carbon dioxide (CO2) regeneration can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, but its effectiveness depends on the reaction conditions. Oxygen regeneration can be more selective than air, reducing the risk of excessive heating, but it may still cause deactivation under certain conditions.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括硫化合物中毒和过氧化。基于铬的催化剂容易因形成铬(VI)物种而失效，这些物种可以还原回铬(III)。VOx催化剂易于通过过氧化而失效，其中钒的氧化状态增加超过稳定V(IV)状态。空气再生对基于铬的催化剂有效，但可能会导致高温，从而影响催化剂的稳定性。二氧化碳(CO2)再生可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，但其有效性取决于反应条件。氧气再生比空气更选择性，减少了过度加热的风险，但在某些条件下仍可能导致失效。
