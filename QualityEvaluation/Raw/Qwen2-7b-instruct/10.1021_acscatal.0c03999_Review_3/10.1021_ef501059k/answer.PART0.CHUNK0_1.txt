<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include exposure to excessive oxygen leading to overoxidation. For Cr-based and VOx catalysts, regeneration methods involve reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. These methods have different effectiveness and temperature requirements. CO2 addition has been considered as a strategy to reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
