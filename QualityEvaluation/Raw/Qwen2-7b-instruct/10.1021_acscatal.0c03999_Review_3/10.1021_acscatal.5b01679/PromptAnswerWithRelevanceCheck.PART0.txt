<quotes>
[1] "The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation."
[2] "Reoxidation with air is generally more effective than with CO2 or O2 due to higher oxygen availability, but requires higher temperatures."
[3] "Temperature requirements for reoxidation with CO2 or O2 are lower compared to air, making these methods more energy-efficient."
[4] "CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing an alternative oxidant."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is primarily caused by sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Among various regeneration methods, reoxidation with air is generally more effective due to its higher oxygen availability, though it demands higher temperatures. Reoxidation with CO2 or O2 has lower temperature requirements, making these methods more energy-efficient. CO2 addition can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by serving as an alternative oxidant.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括烧结、中毒和过氧化。在各种再生方法中，使用空气进行氧化通常更有效，因为氧气的可用性更高，但需要更高的温度。使用CO2或O2进行氧化的温度要求较低，使这些方法在能源效率方面更具优势。通过提供替代氧化剂，CO2添加可以帮助减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化问题。

<quotes>
[1] "In oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation for Cr-based and VOx catalysts include poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO), sintering due to high-temperature operation, and overoxidation."
[2] "Reoxidation with air is more effective than with CO2 or O2 for regenerating VOx catalysts because it helps prevent CO adsorption and overoxidation."
[3] "Temperature requirements for reoxidation with air range from 300 to 600°C, which allows for a balance between efficient regeneration and avoiding excessive catalyst degradation."
[4] "The addition of CO2 during the reoxidation process can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, but it may not be as effective as using air for regeneration."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The main reasons for metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO), sintering due to high-temperature operation, and overoxidation. 
2. Reoxidation with air is more effective than with CO2 or O2 for regenerating VOx catalysts because it helps prevent CO adsorption and overoxidation.
3. The optimal temperature range for air reoxidation is from 300 to 600°C, balancing efficient regeneration and avoiding excessive catalyst degradation.
4. Adding CO2 during the reoxidation process can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, though it may not be as effective as using air for regeneration.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因包括CO中毒、由于高温操作导致的聚集和过度氧化。
2. 用空气重新氧化比使用CO2或O2更有效，因为这有助于防止CO吸附和过度氧化。
3. 空气重新氧化的最佳温度范围为300至600°C，既能实现高效再生又能避免过量催化剂降解。
4. 在重新氧化过程中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，但可能不如使用空气进行再生那么有效。
