The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based and VOx catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been evaluated based on their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition is being explored as a means to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
