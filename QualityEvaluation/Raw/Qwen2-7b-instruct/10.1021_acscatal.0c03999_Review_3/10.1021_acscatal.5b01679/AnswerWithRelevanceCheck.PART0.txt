      <English>
          Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is mainly caused by sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Different regeneration methods like reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have been assessed. CO2 addition is explored to alleviate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

          [1] "Reoxidation with air is generally more effective than with CO2 or O2 due to higher oxygen availability, but requires higher temperatures."
          [2] "Temperature requirements for reoxidation with CO2 or O2 are lower compared to air, making these methods more energy-efficient."
          [3] "CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing an alternative oxidant."

          Reoxidation with air is typically more effective than with CO2 or O2 due to higher oxygen availability, although it necessitates higher temperatures. CO2 or O2 reoxidation has lower temperature requirements, making these methods more energy-efficient. CO2 addition can help reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by offering an alternative oxidant.

          使用空气进行再氧化通常比使用CO2或O2更有效，因为氧气的可用性更高，尽管需要更高的温度。使用CO2或O2进行再氧化的温度要求较低，使得这些方法在能源效率方面更有优势。通过提供替代氧化剂，CO2添加可以帮助减少VOx催化反应中的过氧化问题。
