[1] "In oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation for Cr-based and VOx catalysts include poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO), sintering due to high-temperature operation, and overoxidation."
[2] "Reoxidation with air is more effective than with CO2 or O2 for regenerating VOx catalysts because it helps prevent CO adsorption and overoxidation."
[3] "Temperature requirements for reoxidation with air range from 300 to 600°C, which allows for a balance between efficient regeneration and avoiding excessive catalyst degradation."
[4] "The addition of CO2 during the reoxidation process can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, but it may not be as effective as using air for regeneration."

1. The main reasons for metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are poisoning by carbon monoxide (CO), sintering due to high-temperature operation, and overoxidation. 
2. Reoxidation with air is more effective than with CO2 or O2 for regenerating VOx catalysts because it helps prevent CO adsorption and overoxidation.
3. The optimal temperature range for air reoxidation is from 300 to 600°C, balancing efficient regeneration and avoiding excessive catalyst degradation.
4. Adding CO2 during the reoxidation process can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, though it may not be as effective as using air for regeneration.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因包括CO中毒、由于高温操作导致的聚集和过度氧化。
2. 用空气重新氧化比使用CO2或O2更有效，因为这有助于防止CO吸附和过度氧化。
3. 空气重新氧化的最佳温度范围为300至600°C，既能实现高效再生又能避免过量催化剂降解。
4. 在重新氧化过程中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，但可能不如使用空气进行再生那么有效。
