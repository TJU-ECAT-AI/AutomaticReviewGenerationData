Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is primarily caused by sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Among various regeneration methods, reoxidation with air is generally more effective due to its higher oxygen availability, though it demands higher temperatures. Reoxidation with CO2 or O2 has lower temperature requirements, making these methods more energy-efficient. CO2 addition can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by serving as an alternative oxidant.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括烧结、中毒和过氧化。在各种再生方法中，使用空气进行氧化通常更有效，因为氧气的可用性更高，但需要更高的温度。使用CO2或O2进行氧化的温度要求较低，使这些方法在能源效率方面更具优势。通过提供替代氧化剂，CO2添加可以帮助减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化问题。
