[C1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks."
[C2] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[C3] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34."
[C4] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The primary focus of the document is on the use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34, for catalytic cracking of C4-olefin to produce propylene. The document explores the potential of these materials for generating propylene from less valuable feedstock in the petrochemical industry. It highlights the advantages of using zeolites due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. Among the three catalysts, H-ZSM-5 is found to be the most suitable for propylene production due to its high resistance to deactivation and superior propylene yield.

本文的主要关注点是使用沸石，特别是H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34，用于C4-烯烃的催化裂解以生产丙烯。该文献探讨了这些材料在将较低价值的原料转化为石化工业中重要有机基础材料丙烯的可能性。它强调了使用沸石的优势，由于它们的热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性。在这三种催化剂中，H-ZSM-5被认为是生产丙烯的最佳选择，因为它具有极高的抗失活能力以及优越的丙烯产率。
