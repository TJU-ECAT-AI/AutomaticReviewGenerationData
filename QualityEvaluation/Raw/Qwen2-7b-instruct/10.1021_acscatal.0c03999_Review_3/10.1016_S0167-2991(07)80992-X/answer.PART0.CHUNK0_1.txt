[1] "Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
[2] "Their catalytic performances in C4-olefin cracking reactions were investigated under a weight hourly space velocity as high 15 h-1."
[3] "It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
[4] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[5] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study investigated the catalytic performance of three types of zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34) in the cracking of C4-olefins. The acid strength of the samples followed the order H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in catalytic tests followed the order H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene, particularly when it had a smaller crystal size, which exhibited higher stability over time compared to larger crystal sizes.

研究考察了三种类型沸石（ZSM-5、莫尔登石和SAPO-34）在C4烯烃裂解中的催化性能。这些样品的酸强度顺序为H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite，而它们在催化测试中的稳定性顺序为H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite。发现H-ZSM-5沸石是生产丙烯的最佳催化剂，特别是当其具有较小晶粒尺寸时，显示出比较大晶粒尺寸更高的长期稳定性。
