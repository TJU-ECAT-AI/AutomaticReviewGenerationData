[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins.
Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield.

The primary cause of deactivation for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is not specified within the provided literature. The document discusses the synthesis and catalytic properties of zeolites for propylene production, particularly focusing on H-ZSM-5 as the most suitable catalyst due to its resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield. Comparisons between different regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, and their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, are not addressed in the literature.

Cr基于和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失活原因未在提供的文献中进行说明。该文献讨论了用于丙烯生产的沸石合成及其催化特性，特别强调了H-ZSM-5作为最合适的沸石催化剂，因为它具有抵抗失活的能力和高丙烯产量。文献中没有比较不同再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2的氧化重活）的有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响，包括CO2添加对减轻VOx催化反应中过氧化的潜在作用。
