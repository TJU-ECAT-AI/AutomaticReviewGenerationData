[C1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks."
[C2] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[C3] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34."
[C4] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The primary focus of the document is on the use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34, for catalytic cracking of C4-olefin to produce propylene. The document explores the potential of these materials for generating propylene from less valuable feedstock in the petrochemical industry. It highlights the advantages of using zeolites due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity. Among the three catalysts, H-ZSM-5 is found to be the most suitable for propylene production due to its high resistance to deactivation and superior propylene yield.

[1] "Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
[2] "Their catalytic performances in C4-olefin cracking reactions were investigated under a weight hourly space velocity as high 15 h-1."
[3] "It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."

The study investigated the catalytic performance of three types of zeolites (ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34) in the cracking of C4-olefins. The acid strength of the samples followed the order H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in catalytic tests followed the order H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene, particularly when it had a smaller crystal size, which exhibited higher stability over time compared to larger crystal sizes.

In the context of catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin, zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 were found to have varying acid strengths and stabilities. H-SAPO-34 had the weakest acid strength, followed by H-ZSM-5, and H-mordenite. Stability-wise, H-SAPO-34 was the most stable, followed by H-ZSM-5, and H-mordenite. H-ZSM-5 zeolite, particularly in its smaller crystal size form, proved to be the most effective catalyst for producing propylene from C4-olefin cracking due to its superior resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield.

[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins.
Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield.

The primary cause of deactivation for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is not specified within the provided literature. The document discusses the synthesis and catalytic properties of zeolites for propylene production, particularly focusing on H-ZSM-5 as the most suitable catalyst due to its resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield. Comparisons between different regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, and their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, are not addressed in the literature.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene was found to be the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. This was due to its higher stability and acid strength compared to other zeolites tested, such as H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with smaller crystal size showed even greater stability over longer periods of use.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于C4-烯烃裂解以产生丙烯，最佳催化剂被发现是H-ZSM-5沸石。这是由于其与H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34等其他沸石相比具有更高的稳定性和酸强度。具有更小晶粒尺寸的H-ZSM-5沸石在更长的连续使用时间中表现出更高的稳定性。
