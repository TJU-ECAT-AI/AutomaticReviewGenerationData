[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[2] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[3] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

In the context of catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin, zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 were found to have varying acid strengths and stabilities. H-SAPO-34 had the weakest acid strength, followed by H-ZSM-5, and H-mordenite. Stability-wise, H-SAPO-34 was the most stable, followed by H-ZSM-5, and H-mordenite. H-ZSM-5 zeolite, particularly in its smaller crystal size form, proved to be the most effective catalyst for producing propylene from C4-olefin cracking due to its superior resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield.

在C4-烯烃催化裂解反应中，H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34沸石的酸性和稳定性表现出不同的特性。H-SAPO-34的酸性最弱，其次是H-ZSM-5，H-mordenite最强。稳定性方面，H-SAPO-34表现最优，其次是H-ZSM-5，最后是H-mordenite。H-ZSM-5沸石，特别是其较小晶粒形式，在生产丙烯方面最为有效，因为它具有较高的丙烯产率和对失活的优良抵抗性。
