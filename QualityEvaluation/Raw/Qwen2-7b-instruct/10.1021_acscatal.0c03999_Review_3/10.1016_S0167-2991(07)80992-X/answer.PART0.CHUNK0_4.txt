[1] "Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
[2] "Their catalytic performances in C4-olefin cracking reactions were investigated under a weight hourly space velocity as high 15 h-1."
[3] "It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
[4] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[5] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene was found to be the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. This was due to its higher stability and acid strength compared to other zeolites tested, such as H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with smaller crystal size showed even greater stability over longer periods of use.

对于C4-烯烃裂解以产生丙烯，最佳催化剂被发现是H-ZSM-5沸石。这是由于其与H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34等其他沸石相比具有更高的稳定性和酸强度。具有更小晶粒尺寸的H-ZSM-5沸石在更长的连续使用时间中表现出更高的稳定性。
