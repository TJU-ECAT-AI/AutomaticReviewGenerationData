cluded. In 
view of the presence of intense IR absorption bands 
of OH groups, it is obvious that the amount of strongly chemi- 
sorbed water cannot be significant. If strong interactions were 
to occur between the OH groups and the water molecules, the 
resolution of the corresponding vibrations would be reduced and 
they would shift toward lower wavenumbers.13 
The )'P MAS NMR spectrum of n-DPA-VPI-5 (not shown) 
contains three signals with chemical shifts of -23.3, -27.2, and 
-33.1 ppm in the intensity ratio 1:l:l. The 27Al MAS NMR 
spectrum (see Figure 6) shows the presence of 4-coordinated A104 
and 6-coordinated A106 environments at 41.6 and ca. -1 5 ppm, 
respectively. The similarity of the 31P and 27AI 
MAS spectra of 
n-DPA-VPI-5 and TBA-VPI-5 suggests that the deficiency of 
phosphorus atoms on 
the three kinds of crystallographically in- 
equivalent P sites in n-DPA-VPI-5 is random and that the dis- 
tortion of AI environments due to this deficiency is not reflected 
in the 27AI 
MAS NMR spectrum. 
After calcination of n-DPA-VPI-5 at 200 "C for 6 h and 
followed by rehydration of the calcined sample, both 31P 
and 27Al 
MAS NMR spectra of it are significantly changed (Figures 6 and 
7) indicating the Occurrence of a structural transformation. A 
deconvolution of the 31P 
spectrum reveals the presence of five peaks 
at -22.6, -25.7, -26.9, -29.1, and -31.1 ppm in the intensity ratio 
l:l:l:l:4.5, 
while the 27AI spectrum of hydrated calcined n- 
DPA-VPI-5 shows the presence of 4- and 6-coordinate AI in the 
intensity ratio 2:l. 
Because VPI-5 contains 6-coordinate 
framework AI, it is difficult to know whether or not the 6-coor- 
dinate AI atoms observed in the 27AI 
spectrum of the rehydrated 
calcined sample belong to the framework. We have therefore 
investigated the effect of water upon 
the chemical environments 
of P and AI atoms in calcined n-DPA-VPI-5: the 31P spectrum 
of a sample carefully dehydrated at 200 O
C
 
under vacuum is poorly 
resolved, and the relative intensities of the signals are altered. The 
spectrum, particularly the relative intensities of the peaks, 
depends upon calcination conditions and the hydration state of 
the calcined sample. The 27AI 
spectrum of an anhydrous calcined 
sample shows a significant decrease in the intensity of the octa- 
hedral aluminum signal and a small amount of AI species at ca. 
5.5 ppm. 
Adsorption of N2 
on 
calcined VPI-5 gives the surface area to 
be ca. 117 m2/g, corresponding to 3 N2 
molecules/unit cell of 
VPI-5. This indicates that the pores are almost completely blocked 
by the extraframework species produced during calcination. 
Several groups of researchers have suggested that the reason 
for the irreversible phase transformation in VPI-5 may be the 
presence of impuritie~.~.'~ 
Derouane et al.' claim that such 
impurities can be removed with hot ethanol. Following their 
procedures precisely, we washed our n-DPA-VPI-5 with hot ab- 
solute ethanol at 60 "C for 1 h and calcined the washed sample 
at 200 O
C
 for 1.5 h. However, XRD showed that the washing 
does not prevent the onset of structural transformation.

(Received: December 3, 1990) 
A series of supported V205/Ti02, 
W03/Ti02 
and V2OS-WO3/TiO2 
samples have been characterized by means of Raman 
spectroscopy 
under ambient as 
well as in situ dehydrated conditions and by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Under ambient 
conditions two different hydrated surface vanadia species and crystalline 
V2O5 have been 
identified in V205/Ti02 
as a function 
of surface coverage. Under dehydrated conditions two types of surface vanadium oxide species are found in V205/Ti02 
samples: a highly distorted vanadium oxide species and a moderately distorted vanadium oxide species, and their relative 
concentration is a function of the vanadia surface coverage. Under ambient conditions tetrahedrally coordinated surface 
tungsten oxide species, octahedrally 
coordinated surface polytungstate species, 
and crystalline W03 
are observed in W03/Ti02 
samples as a function of surface coverage. Dehydration converts all the two-dimensional tungsten oxide species into a highly 
distorted octahedrally 
coordinated structure. The molecular structures 
of the V2OS-WO3/TiO2 
mixed samples are not influenced 
by the sequence of impregnation of the starting materials. Under ambient conditions and low vanadia coverage, the hydrated 
surface vanadium oxide species undergo a structural change due to the acidic nature of tungsten oxide species. Crystalline 
V2OS 
and crystalline W03 
are not influenced by the presence of the other metal oxide. Under dehydrated conditions, both 
the highly distorted surface vanadium oxide species and the octahedrally coordinated surface tungsten oxide species do not 
appear to be influenced by each other at all loadings. The only influence 
observed in this study is that the moderately distorted 
vanadium oxide species becomes more abundant in the presence of tungsten oxide. 
Introduction 
Interest in air quality and emission control has resulted in 
considerable research dealing with the selective reduction of ni- 
trogen oxides.] Commercial D~NO, 
catalysts contain v20,- 
W03/Ti02. These catalysts are less active than the V205/Ti02 
catalyst for catalyzing the NO, + NH3 
+ O2 
reaction but have 
an excellent thermal stability and a lower oxidation activity for 
the conversion of SO2 to so,.2 At this moment, very little

information is available about the molecular structure of this 
supported mixed oxide system. Sutsuma et al. investigated the 
molecular structure of bulk V205-W03 catalysts by means of 
secondary ion mass spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy of adsorbed 
NH,, temperature-programmed desorption, NO-NH3 rectangular 
pulse technique, electron spin resonance, X-ray diffraction, and 
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was concluded that V20s 
and WO, are not well mixed in the bulk of the catalyst, but are 
well-mixed in the surface of the catalyst., 
Mahipal Reddy et 
al. studied the influence of Moo3 
and WO, on the dispersion of 
V205 
in vanadiasilica catalysts by using low-temperature oxygen 
chemisorption, 'H NMR, X-ray diffraction, and ESR. The 
presence of molybdenum was found to increase the dispersion while 
the tungsten oxide was found to decrease the dispersion of the 
vanadium oxide on 
silica! 
No characterization studies have been 
reported for the V,05-W03/Ti02 system to date. 
The supported V2OS/TiO2 
system has received much attention 
in the literature because of its superior catalytic activity in the 
selective oxidation of hydrocarbons.s 
Techniques which have 
provided direct structural information about the V205/Ti02 
system 
under ambient and dehydrated conditions are Raman spectros- 
copy,616 X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS, XANES),l7,l8 
solid-state 51V 
NMR spectros~opy,'~ 
and FTIR 
These studies have revealed that the molecular structure of the 
supported vanadium oxide phase on 
titania is different from bulk 
V205 
and is dependent upon the vanadium oxide loading, surface 
hydration, surface impurities, and calcination temperature. It has 
been concluded that under ambient conditions the vanadium oxide 
forms a two-dimensional overlayer in which more than one va- 
nadium oxide species can be present. At low loading metavanadate 
species are primarily observed and at higher loadings decavanadate 
species are primarily present in the hydrated VZO5/TiO2 
samples. 
Under dehydrated conditions two different surface vanadium oxide 
species are found on 
the titania surface which possess tetrahedral 
coordination. One is highly distorted and is observed at all va- 
nadium oxide loadings and the second species is moderately 
distorted and becomes more pronounced at higher vanadium oxide

No precise 
information, however, is provided in the literature about the 
molecular structure of the surface tungsten oxide phase under 
hydrated and dehydrated conditions. 
The purpose of the present study is to determine the molecular 
structure of supported V205-W03/Ti02 
catalysts and the influ- 
ence of the mixed oxide system on the vanadium and tungsten 
structures. Therefore, we have studied the V205/Ti02, 
W03/ 
Ti02, 
and V205-W03/Ti02 
systems with Raman spectroscopy 
under ambient and in situ dehydrated conditions as a function 
of metal oxide loadings. XPS data were also obtained to examine 
the influence of the mixed oxide system on the dispersion of 
vanadium and tungsten on 
the titania surface. 
Experimental Section 
Sample Preparation. All the samples were prepared by the 
incipient wetness method on 
titania (Degussa p-25, 66% anatase, 
34% rutile; 55 
m2/g). The vanadium oxide catalysts were prepared 
by impregnation with a solution of VO(OC2H5), in ethanol. The 
samples were subsequently dried at room temperature and at 110 
O
C
 overnight and calcined in dry air at 450 O
C
 for 2 h. The 
supported tungsten oxide catalysts were prepared by dissolving 
ammonium metatungstate ((NH4)6HZWIZ040) 
in water and im- 
pregnating the Ti02 
support. The samples were then dried at room 
temperature followed by drying at 110 O
C
 overnight and calci- 
nation at 450 O
C
 for 2 h. The V205-W03/Ti02 mixed oxide 
catalysts were prepared by a two-step impregnation procedure. 
First the titania was impregnated with a solution of VO(OC2Hs)3 
in ethanol and dried and calcined as above. Then the tungsten 
oxide was introduced by impregnation with an aqueous solution 
of ammonium metatungstate. These mixed samples were sub- 
sequently dried at room temperature and at 110 O
C
 
overnight and 
calcined at 450 O
C
 for 2 h in dry air. Another set of V205- 
W03/Ti02 
mixed oxide catalysts was prepared starting with the 
impregnation and calcination of the ammonium metatungstate 
solution as described above. The vanadium oxide was then added 
by impregnation with a VO(OC3H5), solution in methanol. Due 
to the air- and moisturesensitive nature of this alkoxide precursor, 
the second impregnation and subsequent drying at room tem- 
perature and heating at 350 "C were performed under a nitrogen 
atmosphere. These mixed oxide samples were finally calcined in 
dry air at 450 O
C
 
for 2 h. 
Raman Studies. Two Raman spectrometers were used in this 
study. Both consisted of a Triplemate spectrometer (Spex, Model 
1877) coupled to an optical multichannel analyzer (Princeton 
Applied Research model 1463) equipped with an intensified 
photodiode array detector (cooled to -35 "C). 
One of the Raman 
spectrometers was used for obtaining the Raman spectra under 
ambient conditions. The sample was pressed onto KBr and spun 
at 2000 rpm. The other spectrometer was equipped with an in 
situ cell in which the temperature and gaseous conditions were 
controlled. Ultrahigh purity, hydrocarbon-free oxygen (Linde Gas) 
was purged through the cell. In situ Raman spectra were recorded 
from stationary samples pressed into self-supporting wafers (no 
KBr). In 
a typical experiment, the sample was heated to 450 O
C
 
in -20 min and held for 30 min. Then the sample was cooled 
down to 80 O
C
 
in - 
1 h. At this temperature the in situ Raman 
spectrum was recorded. Additional details about the in situ cell

have been described elsewhere.6 The 514.5-nm line of an Argon 
ion laser (Spectra Physics) was used in both the setups as the 
excitation source. The laser power at the sample was 40-60 mW 
for the ambient measurements and 60-100 mW for the in situ 
measurements. 
XPS Surface Analysis. The XPS spectra were obtained on a 
Model DS800 XPS surface analysis system (Kratos Analytical 
PIC, 
Manchester UK). A hemispherical electron energy analyzer 
was used for electron detection. Mg Ka X-rays at a power of 
360 W were employed in this study. Data were collected in 
0.75-eV segments for each of the samples. The electron spec- 
trometer was operated in the fixed analyzer transmission (FAT) 
mode. The samples were prepared by pressing the catalyst powders 
between stainless steel holders and a polished single-crystal silicon 
wafer. The powders adhered to the stainless steel holders without 
requiring additional adhesive materials and possessed relatively 
flat surfaces. Electrons with take-off angles of 90° from the 
sample holder plane were selected by the solid angle of acceptance 
of the focusing lens of the instrument. The XPS 
measurements 
were performed at 5 
X 
Torr. Elements detected using each 
spectrum were identified and concentration estimates within the 
2-1 0-nm analyzed layer were made using typical normalization 
procedures. Sensitivity factors employed in the calculatipns were 
selected based on 
the peak envelope measured for each element 
of interest. The peaks included in this study were the Ti2p 
(entire 
envelope), the W,, (entire envelope), and the V,,,,,(only, 
to avoid 
O,, 
peak interferences). Since the carbon concentrations were 
relatively low and the kinetic energy positions of the peaks of 
interest were similar for the elements of interest, the effect of 
carbon overlayer presence was ignored in this study. This was 
also unnecessary since only the changes of the surface ration W/Ti 
[atomic concentrations] against the total tungsten oxide loading 
and the surface ratio V/Ti [atomic concentrations] against the 
total vanadium oxide loading were considered in this work. 
Raman Spectroscopy. Hydrated: V205/Ti02

Raman spectra for the supported vanadium oxide on Ti02 
samples 
recorded under ambient conditions are presented in Figure 1. All 
the spectra show the weak second-order feature of Ti02 
at -795 
cm-’.25 This Ti02 
band becomes less pronounced as the vanadium

The 
vanadium oxide overlayer. The 1% V205/Ti02 
sample reveals 
a broad Raman band at 943 cm-’ which shifts upward to 988 cm-I 
for the 4.5% V205/Ti02 
sample. These broad bands do not belong 
to crystalline V205 
and are assigned to the symmetrical V=O 
stretching modes of two-dimensional surface vanadate species. 
The Raman spectrum of the 8% V205/Ti02 
sample shows the 
sharp and intense band of crystalline V2O5 at 994 cm-I. The 6% 
V205/Ti02 
sample only possesses a trace of V20, as indicated 
by the small 994-cm-I band. Thus, above 6% V,O5/TiO2 the 
monolayer has been exceeded and crystalline V205 
is present on 
the titania support. The presence of two-dimensional vanadium 
oxide species in addition to crystalline V205 
at loadings of 6% and 
higher cannot be excluded because the strong 994-cm-I band of 
crystalline V205 
may overshadow other bands. 
W03/Ti02 
Hydrated. The Raman spectra of WO,/TiO2 under 
ambient conditions are presented in Figure 2. 
The Raman 
spectrum of the 1% W03/Ti02 
sample shows a weak and broad 
band at -935 cm-l which is characteristic of two-dimensional 
tungsten oxide surface species.23 
In 
addition to this 935-cm-I band, 
the second-order feature of Ti02 
at 783 cm-’ is also present.25 
As the loading is increased, the W=O stretching mode shifts 
upward to 965 cm-I. At 10% W03/Ti02, 
a second intense band 
at 800 cm-’ is observed, showing the presence of crystalline W03% 
in addition to the two-dimensional tungsten oxide species (band 
at 965 cm-I). Thus, a monolayer of tungsten oxide on 
titania is 
formed at -8% W03/Ti02. 
V205-W03/Ti02 
Hydrated. Three series of V205-W03/Ti02 
samples have been 
studied to determine the influence of interaction 
between vanadium oxide and tungsten oxide on the titania surface. 
The Raman spectra of the first series, recorded under ambient 
conditions, are shown in Figure 3. The vanadium oxide loading 
is 1% and the tungsten oxide loading increases from 0 to 10%. 
In the absence of tungsten oxide, the Raman spectrum exhibits 
a weak and broad band at 942 cm-I. This band shifts upwards 
to 984 cm-’ with increasing tungsten oxide loading. The Raman 
spectrum of the 1% V,05-10% W03/Ti02 
sample also reveals 
the presence of crystalline W 0 3  
because of the intense band at 
800 cm-I. 
The Raman spectra of the second set of V205-W03/Ti02 
mixed samples are presented in Figure 4. The vanadium oxide 
loading is 4.5% and the tungsten oxide loading increases from 0 
to 10%. In the absence of tungsten oxide, the Raman spectrum

reveals a broad band at 985 cm-I. Increasing the tungsten oxide 
loading does not change the position of this band, which shows 
that the vanadate structure is not influenced by the presence of 
tungsten oxide species. The 4.5% V2O5-lO% W03/Ti02 
sample 
possesses 
crystalline W03 
as indicated by the 800-cm-' band. The

becomes a little sharper by the presence of tungsten oxide, 
but major changes are not observed in Figure 5. 
The spectra presented in Figures 3-5 were obtained from titania 
samples prepared by impregnation with vanadium oxide followed 
by impregnation with tungsten oxide. The same samples have 
also been prepared using the inverse sequence of impregnation. 
The Raman spectra of these samples are identical to those reported 
above, so the sequence of impregnation does not appear to in- 
fluence the final molecular structures under ambient conditions.

sample to 1030 cm-l for the higher loading samples. In addition 
to this sharp band, a second broad band, indicating the presence 
of a second surface vanadium oxide species, appears at lower 
wavenumber with increasing vanadium oxide loading. This band 
shifts from -920 to -940 cm-l with increasing vanadium oxide 
loading. The spectrum of the 8% V2O5/TiO2 
sample shows the 
band of crystalline V,05 at 994 cm-' in addition to the 1031 and

is not influenced by the tungsten 
oxide species and that above monolayer loading crystalline V20S 
as well as two-dimensional vanadium oxide and tungsten oxide 
species exist on the titania surface. The influence of 1% W 0 3  
is less visible because of the low Raman cross-section of the 
dehydrated tungsten oxide species. 
XPS Surface Studies. Vanadium Oxide. The surface V/Ti 
ratios [atomic concentrations], determined from the XPS 
mea- 
surements, versus the total vanadium oxide loading of the 
V2OS-(O-10)% W03/Ti02 
samples are presented in Figure 11. 
For the V205/Ti02 
samples the V/Ti surface ratio increases 
almost linearly with the total vanadium oxide content until -4.5%. 
For higher loadings the surface ratio V/Ti increases slowly with 
the total V20S 
loading as indicated by the small slope of the curve 
above 4.5%. These results are in agreement with our Raman data 
and previous reported XPS 
 measurement^.^'-^^ The change in 
slope has been explained by the fact that XPS 
can detect most 
of the surface metal oxide atoms up to monolayer coverage (so 
the XPS 
signal is directly proportional with the vanadium oxide 
surface content). Above monolayer loading the XPS 
signal in- 
creases very slowly because only those electrons which are emitted 
through the monolayer or from the top of the crystals are de-

This dependence has been previously used to study the 
dispersion of a metal oxide on 
a high surface area surface. If the 
metal oxide is poorly dispersed, the change in slope occurs at lower 
total metal oxide loading and vice ~ e r s a . ~ ~ - ~ O  
Increasing the tungsten oxide loading from 0% (Figure 1 la) 
to 10% (Figure 1 le) does not significantly change the shape of 
the curve or the position at which the slope of the curve decreases. 
This indicates that the dispersion of the vanadium oxide is not 
influenced by the presence of tungsten oxide species on 
the titania 
surface.

W/Ti does not increase, as demonstrated by the plateau observed 
in Figure 12a. In the presence of vanadium oxide the surface 
W/Ti ratios versus the total W03 
curves do not change (Figure 
12, parts b e ) .  This shows that the presence of vanadium oxide 
does not influence the dispersion of the tungsten oxide phase on 
the Ti02. 
Discussion 
Hydrated: V20S/Ti02 
Hydrated. In aqueous solution the 
molecular structure of vanadium oxide is a function of pH and 
vanadium oxide con~entration.~' 
Decreasing the solution pH or 
increasing the vanadium oxide concentration results in a structural 
change from tetrahedral to more complex octahedrally coordinated 
structures. In a recent publication Deo and WachsI6 showed that 
under ambient conditions the structural dependence with loading 
for supported vanadium oxide is similar to what is observed in 
aqueous solution. Under supported conditions the vanadium oxide 
molecular structures were found to be a function of the net pH 
at the point of zero surface charge (pzc) which depends on 
the 
type of support and the vanadium oxide surface coverage. The 
pzc value of Ti02 
has been determined to be 5-6.32 Increasing 
the vanadium oxide loading decreases the net pH at pzc because 
of the acidic nature of vanadium oxide (pzc of 1.5). 
The shift from 943 cm-' for the 1% V20S/Ti02 
sample to 987 
cm-' for the 4.5% V20S/Ti02 
sample is in agreement with pre- 
viously reported Raman s p e ~ t r a ~ - ~ % ' ~ * ' ~  
and suggests that under 
ambient conditions different two-dimensional vanadium oxide 
species may be present in the V205/Ti02 
samples. Based upon 
these band positions alone, however, it is impossible to determine 
the nature of these species since tetrahedral and octahedral, 
monomeric and polymeric vanadium oxide species give rise to 
bands in the 1200-800-cm-' region.33 Additional vanadia modes, 
which are critical for a complete structural analysis, are obscured 
by titania, which itself exhibits very strong Raman bands below 
700 cm-1.25

-550 and 220 cm-I. These bands corresponded to those found 
in tetrahedrally coordinated polymeric vanadates and were 
therefore assigned to surface metavanadate species. At moderate 
loadings a new band was observed at -990 cm-l which was 
accompanied by several weak bands at lower frequencies. These 
bands matched best the Raman bands of the decavanadate cluster, 
V100286, 
which has a distorted octahedral str~cture.'~ 
Com- 
parison of the Raman spectra of V205/Ti02 
with the Raman 
spectra of V2O5/y-AI20, demonstrates that the 940-cm-I band 
in the 1% V20S/Ti02 
spectrum is associated with tetrahedrally 
coordinated metavanadate and the 988-cm-' band at 4.5% 
V,O5/TiO2 arises from to octahedrally coordinated vanadium 
oxide species, which best match the decavanadate cluster. 
Additional information to support this assignment has recently 
been obtained by solid-state 51V 
NMR and FTIR. Solid-state 
51V 
NMR showed that at low loading vanadium oxide favors a 
tetrahedral coordination on 
titania while at higher loadings almost 
all the vanadium oxide is directed into octahedral sites.I9 A recent 
FTIR study of a hydrated 10% V205/Ti02 
sample showed, in 
addition to the 1R band of crystalline V2O5 at 1015 cm-I, a broad 
band at 990 cm-I and a weak band at 940 cm-'.'l The 990-cm-I 
band matches the 1R stretching mode of the decavanadate cluster 
which is found in the 950-1000-~m-~ 
region.37 Thus, the com- 
bination of 5'V NMR, FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy reveals 
that under hydrated conditions two vanadium oxide species are 
present in the V205/Ti02 
samples: a metavanadate species, which 
possesses distorted tetrahedral symmetry, and a decavanadate 
species which has a distorted octahedral coordination. Their 
relative concentrations vary with the vanadium oxide coverage. 
At 6% V205/Ti02 
monolayer coverage has been exceeded, and 
crystalline V2O5 is also present on 
the titania surface. This is in 
agreement with the XPS 
data which show that the V/Ti surface 
ratio increased only slowly with the total vanadium oxide content 
above 4.5% V,OS/TiO2. 
WO,/TiO2 Hydmted. The molecular structure of the supported 
tungsten oxide species also follows the trend predicted by the net 
pH of zero surface charge which is a function of the surface pH 
of the support and the tungsten oxide loading.16 The Raman 
spectra of the WO,/TiO, samples under ambient conditions 
suggest that below 8% different two-dimensional tungsten oxide 
species are present, indicated by the shift from -935 cm-' for 
the 1% W03/Ti02 sample to 960 cm-I for the 8% W03/Ti02 
sample. Above 8% W0,/Ti02, monolayer coverage has been 
exceeded and WO, crystals are also present on 
the Ti02 
surface. 
This is supported by the XPS 
data which show that above 8% 
W0,/Ti02 the surface W/Ti ratio does not increase with in- 
creasing tungsten oxide loading (indicating the presence of a 
crystalline phase). The identification of the different two-di- 
mensional tungsten oxide species is somewhat hampered by the 
strong Ti02 
Raman features below 700 cm-l, which prevent the 
detection of additional tungsten oxide bands. The 935-cm-' band, 
observed in the Raman spectrum of the 1% W03/Ti02 
samples, 
matches the symmetrical stretching mode of tetrahedrally coor- 
dinated tungsten oxide in aqueous solution, WOd2- 
(symmetrical 
stretching mode at 931 cm-l3,). This assignment is in agreement 
with the WO,/y-AI,O, system where combined Raman and 
XANES data revealed the presence of distorted tetrahedral co- 
ordination at low loading.38 The 960-cm-I band in the Raman 
spectrum of the 8% WO,/TiO2 sample is assigned to the stretching 
mode of solvated polytungstate species such as W,Olo(OH)S-(aq), 
W,20396-(aq), 
or W,204110-(aq), 
which all have a distorted oc- 
tahedral ~oordination.~' 
This assignment is based upon the sim- 
ilarity of the Raman spectrum of WO,/y-AI2O3 system at higher 
loadings, which exhibits a band at -980 cm-I accompanied by 
bands at 330, 215, and 550 cm-l. The latter two band are di- 
agnostic of W-0-W linkages found in solvated polytungstate 
clusters.33 The presence of tetrahedrally coordinated tungsten

Hydrated. The above Raman assignments 
for the single V205/Ti02 
and WO,/TiO, systems are now used 
to interpret the Raman bands of the V,O5-WO,/TiO2 mixed 
samples. The first set of mixed samples contain 1% V205 
and 
(0-lo)% W03/Ti02 
and was chosen to study the influence of 
tungsten oxide on 
the molecular structure of metavanadate species. 
At first sight it is not clear if the broad band in the 942-984-cm-l 
region in Figure 3 belongs to vanadium oxide species, tungsten 
oxide species, or to both. However, the broad band shifts to 988 
cm-I while no 
tungsten oxide species has been 
observed on 
titania 
which exhibits a stretching band over 965 cm-I as shown in Figure 
2. Furthermore, as shown above, the Raman cross-section of the 
dehydrated vanadium oxide species is -4 times bigger than the 
Raman cross-section of the dehydrated tungsten oxide species. 
If one assumes that the cross-sections of the hydrated species are 
similar to those of the dehydrated species, then it is likely that 
the Raman bands of hydrated tungsten oxide species are over- 
shadowed by the stronger vanadium oxide stretching mode. The 
984-cm-' band matches the Raman band of the decavanadate 
cluster, as shown above. Thus, the Raman spectra reveal that 
the hydrated metavanadate species are replaced by hydrated 
decavanadate species 
with increasing tungsten oxide loading. This 
effect occurs b

under ambient conditions the vanadium oxide 
structure is dependent on 
the net surface pH at pzc.I6 Increasing 
the tungsten oxide loading increases the aqueous acidity and the 
net pH at pzc decreases resulting in conversion of the meta- 
vanadate species to decavanadate species. 
The second set contains 4.5% V2O5 and (

WO, and was 
chosen to determine the influence of the presence of tungsten oxide 
on 
the decavanadate structure and because 4.5% V205 
on 
titania 
is slightly below monolayer coverage in the single V205/Ti02 
system. In 
the absence of tungsten oxide, the Raman spectrum 
reveals the presence of decavanadate species by the 985-cm-I band. 
Increasing the tungsten oxide loading does not change the position 
of this band, which shows that the decavanadate structure is not 
affected by the presence of tungsten oxide under ambient con- 
ditions. In the absence of tungsten oxide, the net pH at pzc is 
low since decavanadate species are present. Adding tungsten oxide 
does not influence the decavanadate species because an acidic 
aqueous solution is being added to an acidic system, and only the 
decavanadate structure is stable in acidic aqueous  solution^.^' 
The third set of samples contain 7% V2O5 and (0-7)% 
W03. 
Crystalline V2OS 
is observed for all the samples. The 994-cm-' 
band becomes slightly more intense by the presence of tungsten 
oxide which may indicate that the dispersion of the vanadium oxide 
is decreased by the tungsten oxide species. This, however, is not 
supported by the XPS 
data which suggest that the spreading of 
vanadium oxide on the titania surface is not affected by the 
presence of tungsten oxide. 
The Raman spectra, presented for the hydrated V&- 
W03/Ti02 
samples, yield little information about the influence 
of the presence of vanadium oxide on 
the two-dimensional structure 
of the tungsten oxide species. This is because the Raman bands 
of the surface tungsten oxide species are overshadowed by the 
stronger Raman bands of the surface vanadium oxide species. 
However, the two-dimensional tungsten oxide species are expected 
to follow the same trend as the vanadium oxide species since the 
net pH at pzc dependence is generally applicable.16 Thus, the 
tetrahedrally coordinated tungsten oxide species are expected to 
change into octahedrally coordinated tungsten oxide species with 
increasing vanadia content due to the acidic nature of vanadium 
oxide. All the mixed oxide samples containing 8% W03 
show the 
presence of crystalline W03 
by the 800-cm-I band. The 800-cm-' 
band, however, is less intense in the presence of vanadium oxide. 
This can be explained by the fact that the single WOp/Ti02 
samples are white which would make them very good Raman 
scatterers, while mixed samples are dark yellow due to the va- 
nadium(V) oxide and, therefore poorer Raman scatterers. Thus,

is not influenced by the presence of vanadium 
oxide species. This is supported by the XPS measurements which 
show that in the presence or absence of vanadium oxide monolayer 
coverage of tungsten oxide is reached at -7% W03. Raman 
spectroscopy demonstrates that under ambient conditions only the 
metavanadate structure i

oxide. A similar effect has recently been reported for V2OS/TiO2 
and V2O5/y-AI2O3 
 catalyst^'^^^^^^^^ contaminated with alkaline

Dehydrated: V205/Ti02 
Dehydrated. The in situ Raman 
spectra reveal that below monolayer coverage (<6% V20S/Ti02) 
two different vanadium oxide species are present on 
the dehydrated 
titania surface. One species is highly distorted and exhibits a sharp 
Raman band at 1030 cm-I. This species is present at all loadings. 
Recent 51V 
NMR measurements have revealed that the highly 
distorted vanadium oxide species has distorted tetrahedral coor- 
dination and that the tetrahedron possesses 
cylindrical symmetry.lg 
The species only exhibits one Raman band at 1030 cm-' which 
indicates that this species is monmxo (one short V=O bond) since 
a dioxo (two V-0 
bonds) species would show two V=O 
stretching modes if the two V-0 
bonds were inequivalent and 
three bands if the two V=O bonds were equivalent (symmetrical 
stretch, asymmetrical stretch, and bending mode). Cristiani et 
al." reported an IR band at 1035 cm-l for a 10% V205/Ti02 
sample under dehydrated conditions. The coincidence of the 
Raman band at 1030 cm-I and the IR band at 1035 cm-I supports 
the monooxo model since a dioxo vanadate species would exhibit 
a more intense asymmetric stretching mode of the 0-V-0 
group, while the Raman band would show a more intense sym- 
metrical stretching mode. Thus, the combined 51V 
NMR, FTIR, 
and Raman data show that the highly distorted vanadium oxide 
species has a distorted tetrahedral structure with one short V = O  
bond (monooxo). 
However, based upon these data alone it is not possible to 
present a more precise structure. Progress has been made in 
determining the molecular structure of V20S/y-AIz03 
by applying 
the diatomic approximation method, presented by Hardcastle et 
al.39 They established an empirical stretching frequency/bond 
distances correlation by considering each V-0 bond as a totally 
independent oscillator. The Raman spectrum of the V205/yA1203 
sample shows two Raman bands under dehydrated conditions, 
similar to the V2O5/TiO2 
system at 1026 cm-' (sharp) and 850 
cm-l (broad). O

the basis of the diatomic approximation method, 
Hardcastle et al. were able to determine the V-O bond distances 
of the highly distorted vanadate species and to propose a more 
precise structure. Since the Raman, FTIR, and 5'V NMR data 
are similar for the V20S/Ti02 
and V20S/y-A1203 
 system^,'^,^^ 
and the same structure is proposed for the VZOS/TiOz 
system. 
The second dehydrated vanadate species is moderately distorted 
and has a broad Raman band at -920 cm-l which shifts to -940 
cm-l with increasing loading. The second species becomes more 
pronounced at higher loadings. This second vanadate species 
should also possess a tetrahedrally coordinated structure because 
in situ 51V 
NMR showed only the presence of  tetrahedron^.'^ 
Hardcastle et al. suggested that for the V2OS/y-AIzO3 
system, 
two different, moderately distorted, tetrahedrally coordinated 
structures are possible.39 The first one is a monooxo structure,

bond distances. The V-0 
bonds were found to be 
consistent with possible V-OH 
bonds. The second possible 
structure is a dioxo which possesses two terminal V=O bonds and 
two bridging V-0 
bonds. It was argued that the V-0 
bonds 
were consistent with possible V-0-V 
linkages. Thus, the 
moderately distorted monooxo vanadate species is hydroxylated 
and isolated, whereas the dioxo is polymeric. A polymeric 
structure has also been proposed by other

Dehydrated. Upon 
dehydration, the broad bands 
in the 935-960-cm-' region disappear and are replaced by a single 
band at 1010 cm-I for all the tungsten oxide loadings. This shows 
that the dehydration drastically changes the molecular structures 
and that the two-dimensional tetrahedrally coordinated W042- 
as well as the distorted octahedrally coordinated polytungstate 
species are converted into the same surface tungsten oxide species. 
This is in contrast with in situ Raman data of the WO3/y-AI2O3 
system which show two bands, a sharp band at 1016 cm-' and 
a weak, broad band at -870 cm-',6*39340+41 
which indicates the 
presence of two different surface tungsten oxide species. The 
corresponding molecular structures in WO3/y-AI2O3 
have recently 
been determined by Hardcastle et al.39 The 1016-cm-' Raman 
band matches the IR absorption at 1015 cm-I. This indicated 
that the highly distorted tungsten oxide has a monooxo structure.

 upon 
the diatomic approximation method, a highly distorted 
octahedrally coordinated structure was proposed with one short 
W=O bond, one long opposing W-0 
bond and four bridging 
W - 0  bonds. The W03/Ti02 
system shows a similar IOIO-cm-' 
Raman band and recent in situ XANES provided evidence for 
a highly distorted octahedrally coordination of the tungsten oxide 
on the Ti02 
surface.42 Therefore the same highly distorted 
octahedrally coordinated structure is proposed for the W03/Ti02 
system (Figure 14). 
The second broad band at -870-cm-' 
in the spectra of the 
WO3/y-AI2O3 
system has not been 
observed in the Raman spectra 
of the W03/Ti02 
system. The inability to detect this weak, broad 
band may be caused by the increasing slope in the Raman 
spectrum due to the strong 639-cm-' band as well as the weaker 
790-cm-I band of Ti02. If, however, the second surface species 
is not present on 
the titania surface, then a possible explanation 
is that the formation of two types of surface tungsten oxide species 
on alumina is associated with the presence of specific surface 
hydroxyl groups. It is known that alumina possesses different 
surface hydroxyl groups than titania43 
which may explain the 
presence of two types of surface tungsten oxide species on 
the 
alumina surface and one type of surface tungsten oxide species 
on the titania surface.

Dehydrated. Under ambient conditions it has 
been demonstrated that the two-dimensional metal oxide species 
are surrounded by water molecules and, therefore, more or less 
shielded from the support surface. Heating the catalyst removes 
the water and, consequently increases the interaction with the 
support. For supported metal oxide systems where more than one

type of metal oxide is present a number of scenarios could occur 
upon dehydration: (a) The different types of surface metal oxides 
interact strongly and new hetero surface metal oxide species are 
formed. (b) The different types of surface metal oxides exist 
independently from each other on the support. (c) One of the 
surface metal oxide species interacts more strongly with the support 
than the second surface metal oxide species. The dispersion of 
the latter metal oxide is consequently decreased and the metal 
oxide is forced to change its two-dimensional structure, to form 
a three-dimensional crystalline phase or sit on 
top of the former 
metal oxide overlayer. (d) One of the surface metal oxide species 
is adsorbed on the support surface, and the second metal oxide 
species is absorbed into the support surface. 
These various possibilities will be investigated below. The in 
situ Raman spectra of the mixed V20S-W03/Ti02 
samples reveal 
that dehydration drastically changes the molecular structures of 
the surface species. This demonstrates that both the vanadium 
oxide and the tungsten oxide are present on the support and not 
in the support since metal oxides which are located in the support 
are not influenced by the presence of water molecules.23 
A vanadium oxide loading of 4.5% VzOs is slightly below 
monolayer coverage in the single V20S/Ti02 
system and an 8% 
tungsten oxide loading is approximately below monolayer coverage 
in the single W03/Ti02 
system. Therefore, it is expected that 
the greatest interaction between both metal oxides with regard 
to their two-dimensional structures would occur in the 4.5% 
V20s-8% W03/Ti02 
sample. The in situ Raman spectrum of 
this sample, however, only shows the 1030-~m-~ 
band of the highly 
distorted vanadium oxide species, the 930-950-cm-l band of 
moderately distorted vanadium oxide species and the IOIO-cm-' 
band of the octahedrally coordinated tungsten oxide species. The 
band positions of two-dimensional metal oxides are sensitive to 
the support type under dehydrated conditions. The in situ Raman 
band of the highly distorted vanadium oxide species in V205/Ti02 
is found at 1030 cm-' while e.g. 1042 cm-I has been reported for 
VzOs/Si02.'o For WO3/TiO2, the Raman band position of the 
distorted octahedral is I010 cm-I, while e.g. 1016 cm-' has been 
found for W03/y-A1203.39 
Although the 1030- and 1010-cm-I 
bands in the Raman spectrum of the mixed 4.5% V20s-8% 
WO3/TiOZ 
are not well resolved, the spectrum shows that these 
band positions are basically the same as the positions observed 
in the single component V20S/Ti02 
and W03/Ti02 systems, 
respectively. It can, therefore, be concluded that the highly 
distorted vanadium oxide and the octahedrally distorted tungsten 
oxide species are present on the Ti02 
support and not one on 
top 
of the other. Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive technique for the 
detection of metal oxide crystals, but the formation of crystalline 
VzOs or crystalline W 0 3  
was not observed in the 4.5% V,O5-8% 
W03/Ti02 
sample. This is in agreement with the XPS data which 
also show that the dispersion of both metal oxides is not influenced 
by the presence of the other metal oxide. 
Sutsuma et al. investigated the molecular structure of the bulk 
and the surface of V205-W03 catalysts. It was concluded that 
although V20s 
and W 0 3  
are not well mixed in the bulk of the 
catalyst, V and W ions are well-mixed in the surface of the 
~atalyst.~ 
We have not observed any new Raman features which 
would indicate the formation of V-0-W species. However, it is 
possible that very small amounts of V-O-W species are present 
on the surface. Thus, the Raman spectra show that the highly 
distorted surface vanadium oxide species and the highly distorted 
octahedrally coordinated surface tungsten oxide species essentially 
exist independently of each other on 
the titani surface. This is 
consistent with scenario b. However, there is an indication that 
the moderately distorted surface vanadium oxide is influenced by 
the presence of surface tungsten oxide. The 1% V205-( 1-1 0)% 
W03/Ti02 
samples shows a Raman band at -930 cm-l and this 
band shifts from -930 to -950 cm-' in the spectra of 4.5% 
V2O5-( 
1-1 0)% W03/Ti02 
with increasing tungsten oxide loading. 
In the absence of tungsten oxide, the moderately distorted va- 
nadium oxide species is not observed in the 1% V2O5/TiOZ, 
but 
is formed at higher vanadium oxide loadings where the band 
position shifts upwards with increasing vanadium loading. So,

in the presence of tungsten oxide, the moderately distorted surface 
vanadium oxide species becomes more abundant. This is in 
agreement with scenario c according to which one surface metal 
oxide is forced to change into a different two-dimensional 
structure 
due to the presence of the second surface metal oxide species. Thus 
for the mixed V205-W03/Ti02 samples scenario b seems to 
operate at low coverage while at higher coverage both scenarios 
b and c are operational. 
A simple two-dimensional monolayer model does not explain 
how the titania surface can simultaneously accommodate a 
monolayer of vanadium oxide species and a monolayer of tungsten 
oxide species. A possible explanation is that the different surface 
species are interacting with different surface hydroxyl groups. The 
highly distorted surface vanadium oxide species and the surface 
tungsten oxide species may be interacting with two different types 
of surface O H  groups and, therefore, do not "feel" each other. 
An FTIR study on 
the different hydroxyl groups could help clarify 
this matter. 
Although the DeNO, reaction has been 
the subject of numerous 
investigations, the nature of the active species and reaction 
mechanism is still undetermined. It is generally agreed that the 
first step involves the adsorption of NH3 
on 
the catalyst surface. 
Inomata et al.44 
proposed that NH3 
is adsorbed as NH4+, 
inter- 
acting with both a surface V=O group and a surface V-OH 
group. Wong et al.45 
slightly modified this model while Janssen 
et al.46 
proposed that NH3 
is chemisorbed on 
two surface V=O 
groups producing V-ONH2 and V-OH. 
Busca4' argued that 
the first step involves the breaking of the N-H bond of molecular 
coordinated ammonia on surface V02+ 
cations. Gasior et al.48 
proposedthat only V - O H  act as the active site which has recently 
been 
supported by Chen et al. who performed an extended Hiickel 
molecular orbital calculation on 
a model V2O5/TiOZ 
surface.49 
It has further been shown that the activity of the DeNO, reaction 
over V2OS/TiO2 
increases with increasing vanadia content up to 
-7% Vz0s.44b 
An IR study revealed that V2OS/TiO2 
possesses 
Brmsted acid sites which were associated with the surface vanadia 
species since titania does not possesses Bransted acidity.s0 The 
Bransted acidity follows the same trend as the activity for the 
DeNO, reaction and increases with increasing vanadia loading 
up to -5% V205. Okazaki et aLS1 
also demonstrated that 
Bransted acidity is required for the DeNO, reaction. Our study 
shows that under dehydrated conditions the moderately distorted 
vanadium oxide species become more abundant with increasing 
vanadia coverage. Hardcastle et al.38 
argued that the moderately 
distorted vanadium oxide species possibly possesses OH groups. 
It is therefore suggested that the moderately distorted vanadium 
oxide species is possibly the precursor of the active site in the 
DeNO, reaction. The role of the tungsten oxide species, which 
seem to enhance the formation of the moderately distorted va- 
nadium oxide species, is yet not totally clear. O
n
 
alumina, other 
metal oxide such as molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, iron oxide, 
cobalt oxide, and nickel oxide also seem to enhance the formation 
of the moderately distorted vanadium.52

XPS. The Raman spectra reveal that the molecular structure of 
the vanadium oxide species in VzOS/TiOz 
is dependent on 
the 
surface coverage and surface hydration. At low vanadium oxide 
loading, hydrated tetrahedrally coordinated metavanadate species 
is favored under ambient conditions. Distorted octahedral vanadia 
is observed at moderate loadings which best match the hydrated 
decavanadate cluster. Under dehydrated conditions the meta- 
vanadate and decavanadate species are converted into two types 
of surface vanadium oxide species, a highly distorted coordinated 
species and a moderately distorted vanadium oxide species, the 
ratio of which is a function of the vandia coverage. The highly 
distorted vanadium oxide has a tetrahedral coordination and 
possesses one short V=O bond and three bridging V-0 
bonds 
to the support. For the moderately distorted species two structures 
have been proposed, both possessing a tetrahedrally coordination. 
Above monolayer coverage (>6%) crystalline V205 
is also present 
on 
the titania surface. The W03/Ti02 
system shows the same 
structural dependence under ambient conditions with loading. At 
low tungsten oxide loading, tetrahedrally coordinated tungsten 
oxide (W042-) is observed while an octahedrally coordinated 
polytungstate species is formed at moderate loadings. Dehydration 
converts all the two-dimensional tungsten oxide species into a 
distorted octahedral coordinated structure, which possesses one 
short W=O bond, one long opposing W-0 
bond and four 
bridging W-0 
bonds. Above 8%, the monolayer has been ex- 
ceeded and crystalline W03 
is also formed on 
the surface. The 
molecular structure of the mixed VzO5-WO3/TiO2 samples are 
not influenced by the sequence of impregnation with the starting 
materials. Under hydrated conditions, the metavanadate species, 
present at low vanadium oxide loading, are converted into a de- 
cavanadate species due to the acidic nature of tungsten oxide 
species. The decavanadate species, present at moderate vanadium 
oxide loadings, are found to be stable up to high tungsten oxide 
loadings. These situations occur 
because the hydrated metal oxide 
molecular structures are only dependent on 
the net pH at pzc. 
Crystalline V205 
and crystalline W 0 3  
are not influenced by the 
presence of the other metal oxide. This is in agreement with the 
XPS data which suggest that the dispersion of both metal oxides 
is not influenced by the presence of the second metal oxide. Under 
dehydrated conditions, both the highly distorted vanadium oxide 
species and octahedrally coordinated tungsten oxide species are 
found to be present on 
the titania surface at all loadings and do 
not seem to be influenced by each other. The only influence 
observed in this study is that the moderately distorted vanadium 
oxide species become more abundant in the presence of surface 
tungsten oxide.

Collold Particle Charge Determination via the Structure Factor S

The dependence 
of the structure factor S(Q) 
of fluidlike ordered polymer colloid suspensions 
on ionic strength is investigated. 
It is found that a given amount of NaCl influences the structure much more than the same amount of NaOH. This behavior 
is explained in terms of an ion-exchange mechanism that takes place with NaOH but not with NaCI. By 
comparing the 
structure factor S(Q) 
of samples titrated with NaOH with the S(Q) 
of samples titrated with NaCI, one can determine the 
charge of the latex particles, if it is assumed that equal structure factors are due to equal ionic strength in corresponding 
suspensions. 
Introduction 
Considerable effort has been directed toward the understanding 
of the self-organization of supermolecular systems to form fluid-, 
glass-, and crystallike states.’-’ 
Besides phenomenological and 
technological interest, the ultimate goal of such investigations is 
the understanding of the self-organization in terms of the inter- 
actions and properties of the constituents, from which the structure 
is formed. 
In 
order to understand the structure of charge-stabilized systems 
from first principles, one should start with the determination of 
the particle charge. Next, statistical-mechanical methods would 
be necessary 
to determine the effective pair potential of mean force 
V(r). Finally, statistical mechanics or computer simulation 
techniques could be used to predict the resulting structures. 
Despite the simplicity of this concept, each of the steps mentioned 
above is faced with severe difficulties.’ 
In this paper we focus on the problem of how the charge of 
colloid particles can be determined experimentally. Various 
physicochemical methods are presently used to determine the 
charge of polymer latex particles like conductometric titration,M

conductivity measurements,’ and electrophoretic mobility.* In 
the context of the present investigation, conductometric titration 
is of particular interest, since it shows an interesting behavior, 
which initiated the present investigation. 
For conductometric titrations the particles are usually cleaned 
and transferred into the protonated form by means of ion-exchange 
resinsS4 
Thus, at the beginning of a titration experiment a high 
conductivity due to the H+ counterions of the colloid particles is 
expected. By titration with NaOH, the conductivity should de- 
crease until the equivalence 
point is reached since the highly mobile 
H+ ions are replaced by Na+ ions. Experiments show, however, 
that this simple concept does not work. Titration of a perfectly 
cleaned and protonated suspension with NaOH shows surprisingly 
little decrease of the cond~ctivity.~ 
Similarly, on addition of 
Ba(OH)2 the conductivity starts to decrease significantly only as 
the equivalence point is appr~ached.~ 
The explanation of this 
behavior is that the protons in the diffuse double layer of the
