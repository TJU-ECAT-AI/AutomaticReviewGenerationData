ABSTRACT 
 
Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using 
hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as 
directing agents, respectively. Their catalytic performances in C4-olefin cracking reactions 
were investigated under a weight hourly space velocity as high 15 h-1. It was found that the 
acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite; 
and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 Ĭ
H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite. Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst 
for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size 
exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream. 
 
1 . INTRODUCTION 
 
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a 
serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for 
propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene. However, the traditional methods for increasing 
propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], 
which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the 
enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost. Propane dehydrogenation could 
give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods 
of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene. 
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route 
for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it 
will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock. Thus the development of 
more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. One of the most effective 
approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or 
petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or 
higher carbon olefins [1-8]. Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal 
stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]. In 
this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus 
C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34,

covering the range of 12-, 10-, and 8-member-ring zeolites or zeotypes. Among these samples, 
the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the 
resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield. 
 
2 . EXPERIMENTAL 
 
2.1 Preparation of catalysts  
ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 20), mordenite (Si/Al = 20) and SAPO-34 were synthesized 
hydrothermally in a teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with a capacity of 100 ml using 
hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as 
the template, respectively. SAPO-34 was synthesized following the procedure described in 
reference [12]. In one typical run for synthesis of the zeolite mordenite, NaAlO2 was added 
into the mixture containing quantitatively measured distilled water, NaOH and a template 
under stirring, then a pre-selected amount of colloidal silica (40% SiO2) was added. After 
being subjected to ageing at room temperature for 2 h, the mixture was transferred into an 
autoclave and crystallized at 423 K for 3 days. For synthesis of the zeolite ZSM-5, the 
aluminium source Al2(SO4)3g18H2O was added into the mixture containing quantitatively 
measured distilled water, NaOH and a template under stirring, then a pre-selected amount of 
colloidal silica (40% SiO2) was added. After being subjected to ageing at room temperature 
for 2 h, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave. ZSM-5 with large crystal was 
crystallized at 423 K for 1 day statically and ZSM-5 with small crystal was crystallized at 373 
K for 1 day and at 393 K for 1-2 days under stirring. All products were filtered, washed and 
dried at 393 K in air for 10 hours and then were calcined at 873 K for 3 h. Activation of 
zeolite catalysts was performed by repeated ion exchange with a 5 wt.% NH4NO3 solutions, 
followed by calcination under atmospheric pressure at 823 K for 4 h.  
 
2.2 Characterization 
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of zeolite samples were recorded on a Rigaku 
D/max-400 X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu KĮ radiation over 2ș angles ranging from 
5 o to 50 o, with the tube voltage and current specified at 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study was carried out in a XL30E apparatus with an 
accelerated voltage of 20 kV or 25 kV. The acid concentration and strength distribution of the 
catalysts was determined by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) 
using a conventional flow apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. The 
sample loading was 100 mg with particle size of 20-40 mesh. After being flushed with He (25 
ml/min) at 873 K for 60 min, the sample was exposed in a mixed gas containing 9 vol.% of 
NH3 in He at room temperature for ammonia adsorption, and then flushed with pure He at 423 
K until the TCD baseline was unchanged. Afterwards, NH3-TPD was promptly started at a 
heating rate of 10 K/min until the temperature in the apparatus reached 873 K.  
 
2. 3 Catalyst testing 
C4-olefin samples, obtained from Shanghai Petrochemical Company, were used as 
reactants without further purification. The feedstock consists of 49.2 wt% of butanes, 28.3 
wt% of trans-2-butylene, 2.8 wt% of 1-butene, 19.6 wt% of cis-2-butene and 0.1 wt% of 
2-methyl-2-propene. C4-olefin cracking reactions were carried out in a continuous flow 
fixed-bed system, with a stainless-steel tubular reactor containing 0.6 g of catalyst. The 
reactions were conducted at 823 K under atmospheric pressure. The products were analyzed 
 
1308 
online on an HP 4890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ion detector and an HP-AL/S 
GC column (50mh0.53mmh15嘕m). 
 
3 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1 Catalyst characterization 
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 
synthesized in the hydrothermal system using HMDA, TEABr and morpholine as the 
template, respectively. It can be seen that the samples showed exactly the same characteristic 
lines as those of typical zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 reported by previous 
researchers [13]. The SEM images of these samples (Fig. 3) showed no amorphous impurities, 
indicating that all samples possessed good crystallinity.

indicating their acid strength increased in the following order: H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5 
<H-mordenite.

H-SAPO-34; (e) Yield of propylene over H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34. 
 
C4-olefin cracking reactions over H-SAPO-34, H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite were 
conducted at 823 K and a WHSV of 15 h-1 under atmospheric pressure. The conversion of 
C4-olefin as a function of time-on-stream (TOS) over these samples was depicted in Fig. 4a. It 
can be seen from Fig. 4a that both the H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite zeolites exhibited high 
 
1310 
initial conversion of C4-olefin, however, the deactivation rate of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was 
obviously slower than that of H-mordenite. H-SAPO-34 showed the lowest initial conversion 
of C4-olefin, although its stability had no significant difference compared to that of H-ZSM-5. 
Figs. 4b-d show the products selectivity over H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34, 
respectively. Besides the aimed product of propylene, other products, such as methane, ethane, 
ethylene, propane and C5
+ products (including aromatics, paraffin and olefins) also formed. 
Such results indicated that reactions of C4-olefin over zeolite samples are very complicated. 
Besides the main cracking reaction, oligomerization, isomerization, aromatization and 
hydrogen transfer reactions have also taken place. Fig. 4e shows the yield of propylene over 
these zeolite samples. It can be seen from Fig. 4e that H-ZSM-5 presented the highest yield of 
propylene after 5 h of TOS. The propylene yield over H-ZSM-5 was above 30 wt% when the 
conversion of C4-olefin ranged from 70 wt% to 80 wt%. In the case of zeolite catalysts, 
coking was the main cause of deactivation during C4-olefin cracking reactions under the 
water-free reaction condition. Coke tended to build up on strong acid sites of zeolite, so 
H-mordenite would not be suited to C4-olefin cracking reaction because of its extremely 
strong acidity. Besides, H-mordenite possessed the one dimensional channel system, which 
would further weaken its coking-resistant ability during C4-olefin cracking reaction. As for 
H-SAPO-34, although its acidity was favorable for C4-olefin cracking, its pore structure was 
characteristic of 8-member-ring size. The small diameter of its internal channels (0.44u0.31 
nm [13]) was unfavorable for the inner diffusion of the reactant and product molecules. The 
ZSM-5 zeolite possessed a 3-dimentional channel system and its pore structure was 
characteristic of the 10-member-ring size. Among these zeolites, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite would 
be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene due to its appropriate 
acidity and pore structure.

Reaction conditions: atmospheric pressure, WHSV = 10 h-1, T= 823 K 
 
To further investigate catalytic performs of the ZSM-5 zeolite, three kinds of the ZSM-5 
samples with different crystal sizes were synthesized and their catalytic performance in 
C4-olefin cracking reactions was investigated. SEM images show that the crystal sizes of 
ZSM-5 samples A, B and C were about 20~30 Pm, 1~2 Pm and 0.2~0.3 Pm, respectively. 
Sample characterization results showed that these samples had almost the same BET surface 
area (~390 m2/g) and acid sites (~0.27h10-3 mol/g). However, their catalytic cracking 
performances were obviously different. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the catalytic stability of 
these samples were closely related to their crystal sizes. Their catalytic stability increased 
 
1311 
steadily with the decreasing crystal size of the samples. Obviously, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite with 
larger crystal size possessed a longer channel. When the pore mouth was blocked with a 
certain amount of coke, C4-olefin molecules could not enter the channels and hence could 
lead to deactivation of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite, despite that a large amount of active sites still 
existed inside its channels. As regards the H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size, more pore 
mouths were exposed to exterior. The same amount of coke could not block all the pore 
mouths, and C4-olefin molecules could still enter a part of channels of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. 
Hence, when the H-ZSM-5 zeolite with large crystal size was deactivated, the H-ZSM-5 
zeolite with small crystal size still showed high activity.  
 
4 . CONCLUSIONS 
 
Zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34 were prepared and their catalytic 
performance for C4-olefin cracking was investigated. Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 
zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene due to its 
appropriate acidity and unique pore structure. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size 
showed better durability than the H-ZSM-5 zeolite with large crystal size in the catalytic 
cracking of C4-olefin for producing propylene.
