[1] "However, (ordered) porosity did not appear a requisite to have highly active catalysts."
[2] "The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."
[3] "It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

1. Ordered porosity does not seem to be essential for the high activity of catalysts.
2. The decrease in propane conversion is attributed to coke formation, which affects the activity of catalysts differently due to their textural features and the amount of Brnsted acid sites.
3. The variation in chromium oxidation state could influence the selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4 based on the oxidant used.

1. 有序孔隙度似乎不是催化剂高活性的必要条件。
2. 烯烃转化率的下降应归因于焦炭的形成，它以不同的方式影响催化剂的活性，这可能与它们的结构特性和酸性位点的数量有关。
3. 铬物种的氧化态变化可能会导致C3H6和C2H4的选择性和产率在使用不同的氧化剂时有所不同。
