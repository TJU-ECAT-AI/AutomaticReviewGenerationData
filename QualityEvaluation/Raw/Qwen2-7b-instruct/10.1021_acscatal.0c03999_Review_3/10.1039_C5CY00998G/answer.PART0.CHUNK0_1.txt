[1] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred,independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."
[2] "The catalyst appeared quite active also in propane direct hydrogenation (curve a), but both the initial and final C3H8 conversion (ca. 60% and 40%, respectively) resulted significantly lower than for the tests carried out in ODH conditions (curves b-d)."
[3] "Of course, the switch from direct to oxidative propane dehydrogenation was expected to affect also the formation of coke."
[4] "The results obtained in propane ODH using O2 or O2+CO2 suggest that it could be worthwhile to investigate the possibility to tune the O2/CO2 ratio in order to obtain a desired composition of the olefin mixture to obtain tailored feeds for C2H4/C3H6 copolymerization."
[5] "However, when the oxidant for ODH was O2 or the O2+CO2 mixture (curves c,d, respectively). yield"

1. No irreversible deactivation occurred regardless of the dehydrogenation conditions, as evidenced by the overlap of propane conversion curves for subsequent catalytic runs.
2. The catalyst showed moderate activity in direct propane hydrogenation, with initial and final C3H8 conversion rates significantly lower than in oxidative dehydrogenation conditions.
3. The switch from direct to oxidative propane dehydrogenation influenced the formation of coke.
4. Tuning the O2/CO2 ratio could lead to a desired olefin mixture composition for producing tailored C2H4/C3H6 copolymers.
5. The weight loss attributable to coke removal by heating in air decreased with the use of O2 or O2+CO2 as oxidants for oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. 不论在何种脱氢条件下，均未发生不可逆失活，由后续催化运行得到的丙烷转化曲线重叠即可证明。
2. 在直接丙烷氢化过程中催化剂表现出一定的活性，初始和最终的C3H8转化率远低于氧化脱氢条件下的数值。
3. 直接脱氢转变为氧化脱氢时，焦炭的形成受到了影响。
4. 调整氧气与二氧化碳的比例可能有助于获得所需的烯烃混合物组成，以生产定制的C2H4/C3H6共聚物。
5. 加热至空气中的焦炭去除质量损失随着使用氧气或氧气与二氧化碳混合物作为氧化脱氢的氧化剂而降低。
