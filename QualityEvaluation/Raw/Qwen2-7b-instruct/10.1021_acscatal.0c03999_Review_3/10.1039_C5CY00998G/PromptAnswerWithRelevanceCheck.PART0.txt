What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

<quotes>
[1] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."
[4] "The XANES spectrum of 1.0-Cr/DHS sample treated in the presence of the various reaction mixtures in situ in the cell used for XANES measurements."
[5] "During direct dehydrogenation or ODH in the presence of CO2 the active chromium species are in average in the +2 oxidation state,whereas when O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Increasing chromium content led to a decrease in the regularity and extent of mesopores, yet this did not hinder the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher chromium loadings.

2. All catalysts showed resilience against irreversible deactivation, even after approximately 900 minutes of operation, achieving propene yields as high as 40%.

3. The synthesis and testing results enabled an understanding of how different oxidants influence the chromium oxidation state, and there's a tentative link between the chromium species' oxidation state (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction and propene selectivity.

4. The XANES spectra of the 1.0-Cr/DHS sample were taken in situ in the cell utilized for XANES measurements.

5. During direct dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide as the oxidant, the average oxidation state of chromium species was +2. In contrast, when oxygen was used for oxidative dehydrogenation (either alone or combined with carbon dioxide), the average oxidation state of chromium species was estimated to be +3.

[1] "Noticeably, no irreversible deactivation occurred,independently on the dehydrogenation conditions, as indicated by the overlapping of the propane conversion curves obtained for subsequent catalytic runs."
[2] "Moreover, the coincidence between the behaviour exhibited by each catalyst in the first (open symbols) and subsequent (full symbols) 5-8 runs, is a clear evidence that no irreversible deactivation occurred."
[3] "Thermodynamic calculations indicated that the equilibrium conversion of propane in the reaction 38 + 2 = 36 +  + 2 carried out at 873 K is ca. 67%.20 However, it must be considered that parallel reactions also contributed to C3H8 conversion."
[4] "Actually,some H2 (< 0.5 mol%) was found among the products when CO2 alone was used as oxidant, likely resulting for the occurrence to some extent of both propane direct dehydrogenation and water gas shift reaction."
[5] "By combining propane conversions obtained with 2.0-Cr/DHS catalyst in the various reaction conditions with selectivity toward propylene and total olefins (reported in Fig. S7 in ESI), C3H6 and C2H4 yields were calculated (Fig. 8, panel A and B, respectively)."
[6] "The results of the characterization activity reported above (section 3.2) indicated that the speciation of Cr can be considered equivalent for all catalysts."
[7] "Moreover, the spectrum of the catalyst used for ODH with O2+CO2 as oxidant was characterized, in the white-line region, by a weak, ill resolved doublet at 6008 and 6010 eV, which can result from multiple-scattering contributions of Cr2O3-like particles."

1. No irreversible deactivation occurred regardless of the dehydrogenation conditions, as evidenced by the overlapping propane conversion curves from successive catalytic runs.
2. The matching behavior of each catalyst in the initial and subsequent runs provides clear evidence of no irreversible deactivation.
3. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that the equilibrium conversion of propane in a specific reaction at 873 K is approximately 67%, but other concurrent reactions also influenced the conversion of propane.
4. When using CO2 solely as an oxidant, some hydrogen (less than 0.5 mol%) was detected in the products, implying that both direct dehydrogenation of propane and water gas shift reaction occurred to some extent.
5. By merging propane conversion rates from different conditions, selectivity towards propylene, and total olefins (from Fig. S7 in ESI), yields for C3H6 and C2H4 were computed (Fig. 8, panels A and B respectively).
6. Based on the characterization activities detailed in section 3.2, the chromium speciation remained consistent across all catalysts.
7. The XANES spectrum of the catalyst utilized for oxidative dehydrogenation with O2+CO2 as oxidant showed a faint, unresolved doublet at 6008 and 6010 eV in the white-line area, indicative of multiple-scattering contributions from Cr2O3-like particles.

1. 不管在何种脱氢条件下，都没有发生不可逆失活，这从后续催化运行得到的丙烷转化率曲线重叠中可以明确看出。
2. 每个催化剂在初始和后续运行中的匹配行为提供了没有不可逆失活的明确证据。
3. 热力学计算表明，在873 K下进行特定反应时，丙烷的平衡转化率为大约67%，但其他同时发生的反应也影响了丙烷的转化率。
4. 当仅使用CO2作为氧化剂时，检测到一些氢（少于0.5摩尔%），这暗示了直接脱氢化丙烷和水煤气变换反应在某种程度上同时发生。
5. 通过合并不同条件下的丙烷转化率、丙烯选择性以及总烯烃（从图SI中的第7节得出）的数据，计算出了C3H6和C2H4的产率（图8的面板A和B分别对应）。
6. 根据在3.2节中详细描述的表征活动，铬的物种在整个催化剂中保持一致。
7. 对于使用O2+CO2作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢过程所用的催化剂的XANES谱图，在白色线区域显示了一个模糊的、未解决的双峰，位于6008和6010 eV，这表明Cr2O3类似的颗粒存在多重散射贡献。

[1] "However, (ordered) porosity did not appear a requisite to have highly active catalysts."
[2] "The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."
[3] "It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Ordered porosity does not seem to be essential for the high activity of catalysts.
2. The decrease in propane conversion is attributed to coke formation, which affects the activity of catalysts differently due to their textural features and the amount of Brnsted acid sites.
3. The variation in chromium oxidation state could influence the selectivity and yield of C3H6 and C2H4 based on the oxidant used.

1. 有序孔隙度似乎不是催化剂高活性的必要条件。
2. 烯烃转化率的下降应归因于焦炭的形成，它以不同的方式影响催化剂的活性，这可能与它们的结构特性和酸性位点的数量有关。
3. 铬物种的氧化态变化可能会导致C3H6和C2H4的选择性和产率在使用不同的氧化剂时有所不同。
