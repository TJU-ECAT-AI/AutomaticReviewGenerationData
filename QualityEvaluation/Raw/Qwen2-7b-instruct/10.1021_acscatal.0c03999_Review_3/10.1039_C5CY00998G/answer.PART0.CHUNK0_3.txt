[1] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[2] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[3] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[4] "XANES data of reacted catalyst indicated that when CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant."

1. The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly with an increase in chromium content, but this did not restrict the catalytic activities of the catalysts with higher chromium loadings.

2. Surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers were the only chromium species identified across all catalysts, as determined by diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, and infrared spectra of adsorbed NH3.

3. All catalysts showed resistance to irreversible deactivation and were able to achieve propene yields as high as 40% even after approximately 900 minutes of testing.

4. XANES analysis revealed that the average oxidation state of chromium sites was as low as +2 when CO2 was used as the oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation, whereas it could be as high as +3 when oxygen was also present as an oxidant.

1. 随着铬含量的增加，介孔的范围和规律性显著下降，但这并未限制高铬负载催化剂的催化性能。

2. 所有催化剂中只发现了表面铬酸盐和Brnsted酸中心，通过漫反射电子光谱、X射线吸收边谱技术和吸附NH3的红外光谱确定。

3. 所有催化剂都表现出对不可逆失活的抵抗力，并能在测试约900分钟后达到高达40%的丙烯产率。

4. XANES分析显示，在使用二氧化碳作为氧化剂进行氧化脱氢时，铬位点的平均氧化态可以低至+2，而当氧气也作为氧化剂存在时，该值可以高至+3。
