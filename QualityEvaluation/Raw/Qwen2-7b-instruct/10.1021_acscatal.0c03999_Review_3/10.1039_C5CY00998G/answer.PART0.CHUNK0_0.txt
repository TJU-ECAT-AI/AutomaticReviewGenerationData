[1] "The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings."
[2] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[3] "The combination of spectroscopic and catalytic results allowed to rationalize, at least in part, the role of different oxidants in defining the chromium oxidation state and a tentative correlation of the oxidation state of Cr species during the reaction (Cr2+/Cr3+) with selectivity in propene is suggested."
[4] "The XANES spectrum of 1.0-Cr/DHS sample treated in the presence of the various reaction mixtures in situ in the cell used for XANES measurements."
[5] "During direct dehydrogenation or ODH in the presence of CO2 the active chromium species are in average in the +2 oxidation state,whereas when O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

1. Increasing chromium content led to a decrease in the regularity and extent of mesopores, yet this did not hinder the catalytic performance of catalysts with higher chromium loadings.

2. All catalysts showed resilience against irreversible deactivation, even after approximately 900 minutes of operation, achieving propene yields as high as 40%.

3. The synthesis and testing results enabled an understanding of how different oxidants influence the chromium oxidation state, and there's a tentative link between the chromium species' oxidation state (Cr2+/Cr3+) during the reaction and propene selectivity.

4. The XANES spectra of the 1.0-Cr/DHS sample were taken in situ in the cell utilized for XANES measurements.

5. During direct dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide as the oxidant, the average oxidation state of chromium species was +2. In contrast, when oxygen was used for oxidative dehydrogenation (either alone or combined with carbon dioxide), the average oxidation state of chromium species was estimated to be +3.

1. 随着铬含量的增加，介孔的规律性和数量显著减少，但并未限制高铬负载催化剂的催化性能。

2. 所有催化剂表现出对不可逆失活的抵抗性，即使在测试大约900分钟后，丙烯产率仍可达到40%。

3. 合成和测试结果揭示了不同氧化剂如何影响铬的氧化状态，并且推测了反应中铬物种的氧化状态（Cr2+/Cr3+）与丙烯选择性的可能联系。

4. 在用于XANES测量的细胞中就地进行了1.0-Cr/DHS样品的XANES光谱测定。

5. 在直接脱氢或以二氧化碳作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢过程中，平均铬物种氧化状态为+2。相比之下，在仅使用氧气或氧气与二氧化碳混合进行氧化脱氢时，平均铬物种氧化状态估计为+3。
