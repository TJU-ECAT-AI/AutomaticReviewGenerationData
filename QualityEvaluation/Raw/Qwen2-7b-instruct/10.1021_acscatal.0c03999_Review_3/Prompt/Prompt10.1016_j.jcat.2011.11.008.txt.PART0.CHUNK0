Temperature-programmed reduction a b s t r a c t The relation between tungsten and vanadium oxide species in V2O5AWO3/TiO2 catalysts for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides by ammonia was studied with two series of catalysts containing
0.55 wt.% V2O5 and 0 or 10 wt.% WO3 impregnated onto a high surface-area titania hydrate of anatase
structure to keep theoretical surface coverages of the transition metal oxides 61. The catalysts, which were investigated by XRD, nitrogen physisorption, Raman and EPR spectroscopy, temperature-pro- grammed reduction (TPR), and catalytic reduction studies, all exhibited the well-known acceleration of the SCR reaction by the tungsten promoter. From the EPR spectra and the TPR profiles, it was concluded that the presence of tungsten induces the formation of a surface oxide phase with intimate mixing between vanadium and tungsten oxide species instead of pronounced surface vanadium oxide island for- mation, which was found in the absence of tungsten. This suggests that the promotional effect of tung- sten may originate from a direct influence on the neighboring vanadium oxide species or from the disruption of too large surface vanadium oxide ensembles. 2011 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a well-established technol- ogy for the removal of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) from station- ary emission sources [1]. The ammonia reductant reduces NOx selectively to nitrogen (e.g., for NO):
4NO  4NH3  O2 ! 4N2  6H2O
Typical industrial catalysts contain V2O5 and WO3 supported on TiO2 (anatase) [1]. Vanadium oxide is the active component, but due to its toxicity and its activity for undesired SO2 oxidation, its content is usually 62 wt.% [2,3]. WO3 is a promoter and stabilizer [4,5], typically with an amount of 10 wt.%, which is described to in- crease the activity, widen the temperature range in which the cat- alysts are selective and to stabilize their physical surface area [2,4,6,7]. These catalysts, which provide high NOx conversion and N2 selectivity between 550 and 670 K [1,8], are often considered to be technically mature and well studied. There are, however, com- peting views on the origin of the promoting effect of the W component.
It has long been known that the interaction of TiO2 with sup- ported V(V) or W(VI) oxide species leads to surface oxide phases with structures strongly different from those of the corresponding bulk oxides [9,10]. In the case of vanadium, isolated surface oxide species with a strongly distorted tetrahedral geometry were ob- served in dehydrated samples at low V oxide coverage [1015].
With increasing loading, two-dimensional islands of oligomeric or polymeric metavanadate species are formed [911,14], and crystalline V2O5 nanoparticles were observed at high vanadium content [11,14]. There was a dispute if aggregates or oxide crystals may occur at V oxide contents below the theoretical monolayer coverage, but it was shown by surface analytical techniques that in well-prepared catalysts, the surface oxide species do not grow into the third dimension until the support is completely covered by the two-dimensional surface oxide phase [16,17]. In dehydrated WO3/TiO2 catalysts, strongly distorted octahedral surface species ((AO)5AW@O) were reported to predominate up to high tungsten oxide coverage [11]. They were found to coexist with tetrahedral monovanadate and polymeric surface vanadates in V2O5AWO3/ TiO2 catalysts: The abundance of the polymeric species increased with increasing tungsten content at metal coverages which consid- erably exceeded the monolayer limit if both metals were to com- pete for the same surface sites [11].
There is remarkable agreement regarding the nature of the active sites for ammonia-SCR in V2O5/TiO2. Although isolated 0021-9517/$ - see front matter  2011 Elsevier Inc.

Journal of Catalysis 286 (2012) 237247 Contents lists available at SciVerse ScienceDirect Journal of Catalysis journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jcat vanadium oxo sites were proposed in early studies [18], the partic- ular role of oxo-bridged dimeric vanadium sites has been empha- sized by many groups [1923]. A stronger than proportional increase of the catalytic activity with the vanadium content [22,24] indeed supports the higher activity of dimeric (polymeric) sites, but also indicates an activity of isolated V oxo centers. The latter have been suggested to be an order of magnitude less active but more selective for N2 formation [24]. Brnsted sites (VAOH) have been found to be involved in the reaction as well [2527].
The observations made with V2O5/TiO2 catalysts are well ex- plained by a catalytic cycle proposed by Topsoe et al. [2831] on the basis of in situ FT-IR and online mass spectrometric studies,which employs dimeric sites comprising both a VAOH and a V@O entity.
Previous explanations for the promoting effect of the W com- ponent in these catalysts rely on various experimental observa- tions. Thus, their acidity was increased in the presence of tungsten, which favors the ammonia supply for the reaction [6,32]. Tungsten oxide was reported to delay the loss of BET sur- face area [5,33] and the transformation from monomeric vanadyl to crystalline V2O5 during aging [34]. It was also observed to in- crease the reducibility of the V component [6], which might favor the catalytic reaction. The aspect most closely related to the above-mentioned concept of the active sites was, however, the suggestion that the W component occupying a significant part of the support surface enforces a closer proximity on the surface V oxide species encouraging thus the formation of the most active VAOAV structures [6]. In the latter role, the tungsten species are just spectators. One might, therefore, expect that similar activities can be achieved also in absence of tungsten by systematically decreasing the TiO2 surface area, but reports on such an approach are not available.
We have now studied the influence of tungsten on V2O5/TiO2 catalysts for NH3-SCR by comparing two series of catalysts with identical vanadium contents differing by the presence or absence of 10 wt.% WO3. The catalysts were prepared by a method near to industrial practice (incipient wetness impregnation). Deliber- ately mild conditions were, however, chosen for the final thermal step (synthetic air, 623 K, 1 h), because we did not aim at maxi- mum activity, instead the purpose was to fix the species struc- ture resulting from the impregnation by inducing condensation with the support OH groups. The promotional effect of the tung- sten was verified by catalytic investigation of the SCR activity,and the structural properties of the samples were studied by XRD, nitrogen physisorption, temperature-programmed reduc- tion, EPR, and Raman spectroscopy. The data suggest that vana- dium and tungsten oxide species tend to create a mixed surface oxide phase and that the effect of tungsten is rather to prevent than to encourage island formation of the surface V oxide component.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Samples were prepared starting from a titania hydrate in the anatase modification, for which an ignition loss of 11.9%, a specific surface area of >250 m2/g, a density of 3.8 g/cm3, a sulfate content of 62%, and impurity contents of Fe2O3 and Na2O <100 ppm each are specified by the manufacturer. Sources for W and
V
were ammonium para tungstate
(APT,
(NH4)10-
(H2W12O42)4H2O,
Tima Tungsten GmbH,impurity elements <0.0088 wt.%) and ammonium meta vanadate (NH4VO3, Acros,99%). The reaction feed was prepared from pre-mixed gas mixtures (Air Liquide).
2.2. Catalyst preparation and characterization
WO3 was deposited on the TiO2 hydrate by wet impregnation of APT from its aqueous solution, the concentration of which was chosen to obtain a tungsten oxide loading of 10.0 wt.%. Subse- quently, the material was dried at 383 K overnight and calcined at 713 K for 1 h (heating ramp 2 K/min to 400 K, then 5 K/min, in flowing synthetic air, 20% O2/He), which brought the BET surface area down to 140 m2/g.
The WO3/TiO2 material and the initial TiO2 hydrate were wet impregnated with an aqueous NH4VO3 solution to obtain loadings of 0.5, 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0 wt.% V2O5. The eight resulting catalysts were dried overnight at 383 K and calcined in O2/He (20% O2, synthetic air) at 623 K for 1 h, which will be denoted as reference calcina- tion. These materials will be labeled W10Vx and Vx, respectively,where x reports the V2O5 content (wt%). For reference purposes,one V2O5/TiO2 catalyst (5 wt.% V2O5) was made with a BET surface area similar to those of the tungsten-containing catalysts (cf.
Section 3.1.) by employing the TiO2 hydrate after a calcination at 673 K for 1 h resulting in a BET surface area of 128 m2=g ! V
5:0.
Specific surface areas of the catalysts were determined by nitro- gen physisorption using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 MP instru- ment. Prior to analysis, the samples were outgassed for 2 h at 573 K. The XRD measurements were performed with a D8 Advance instrument (Bruker AXS), using Cu Ka radiation (0.15413 nm,40 kV, 40 mA). Temperature-programmed reduction was made with 4.5% H2 in Ar, ramping the temperature to 1073 K or 1273 K at 10 K min1. The effluent gas was analyzed by a Hydros thermal conductivity detector (Fisher-Rosemount).
The EPR spectra of dehydrated samples (1 h at 623 K in Ar) were measured with an ELEXSYS 50010/12 CW spectrometer (Bruker) using a microwave frequency of 9.5 GHz (X band), a power of
6.3 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation
amplitude of 0.5 mT. Spectra were recorded at 77 K. Spectral inten- sities were normalized on the sample mass. Therefore, intensities are directly comparable,although an integration was not performed. The simulation of the EPR spectra was done by the program SIM14S [35] (version 06/09/1991).
FT-Raman spectra of dehydrated samples (1 h at 623 K in Ar) were measured with a Thermo Nicolet Vectra Plus Instrument using a laser wavelength of 1064 nm (NIR) at 370 mW. The spec- trometer resolution was 4 cm1. The resultant interferograms were collected with a liquid nitrogen-cooled Ge detector; the spectra were visualized with the OMNIC 6.2 software. Some spectra (see legend to Fig. 7b) were measured with a DRX Raman Microscope (Thermo Scientific).
2.3. Catalytic measurements
The catalysts were pressed and sieved to arrive at a grain size of 250350 lm. Their activity was studied in a micro flow reactor (in- ner diameter  4.2 mm) with a feed gas mixture containing 1000 ppm NO, 1000 ppm NH3, and 2% O2 in He. The experiments were made with a modified residence time
W/F
of
3.3  103 g s ml1
(catalyst mass
10 mg,feed flow
183.3 ml min1). With an approximate bed density of 0.68 g cm3
deduced from the bed height obtained, this results in a GHSV of 750,000 h1. In the experiments, the temperature was raised to the reaction temperatures at 5 K min1 and conversions were re- corded after the steady state had been attained. Data obtained be- tween 423 and 723 K will be reported in this paper, although the conversions achieved above the calcination temperature of 623 K cannot be referred to the initial state of the catalysts.
NO and NH3 conversions were determined with a non-disper- sive IR photometer (XStream, Emerson). An NO2 analyzer in the analytical scheme did not indicate formation of sizable amounts 238
P.G.W.A. Kompio et al. / Journal of Catalysis 286 (2012) 237247
of NO2. In these experiments, N2O was not analyzed. However, in similar experiments with a different series of V2O5AWO3/TiO2 cat- alysts [36,37], the nitrogen selectivity remained typically >95% be- low 723 K.
3. Results
3.1. Texture studies
In Table 1, the BET surface areas of the catalysts and the titania hydrate, all after the reference calcination (623 K, 1 h), are summa- rized and employed for the evaluation of transition metal surface coverage data. The surface areas of the tungsten-containing cata- lysts are between 115 and 125 m2/g, those of the tungsten-free samples between 175 and 225 m2/g. Unexpectedly, there is no in- verse relation between BET surface area and vanadium content,although surface vanadium oxide species have been described to destabilize the texture of TiO2. A parallel trend can be noted in both series, although the changes between the W-containing catalysts seem to be near the limits of experimental error. However, it seems significant that the lowest BET surface area occurs with 1.5 wt.% V2O5, for reasons which have not been understood so far. It is also remarkable that the BET surface area of all tungsten-containing catalysts fell short of 140 m2/g, although the final calcination tem- perature (623 K) was well below that employed to establish the 140 m2/g of the WO3/TiO2 precursor.
Table 1 indicates a failure in our initial intention to keep the BET surface areas of both series in a comparable range. This means that indeed two parameters are changed between these two series: the presence of tungsten and the BET surface area. It will be seen below, however, that this drawback will not interfere with the con- clusions to be drawn from the data. Sample V
5:0 with a BET surface
area comparable to that of the W-containing catalysts has been included in the study to remove remaining doubt.
For the evaluation of the theoretical surface coverage of the tran- sition metal oxide species, different parameters for their areal monolayer density are available in the literature: according to [38], 12.7 lmol V or 6.8 lmol W can be accommodated per m2 sup- port surface; according to [39], the densities are somewhat less (10.4 lmol V or 4.6 lmol W per m2). In Table 1, coverage degrees according to both sets of density data are given. For the tungsten- containing catalysts, the coverage can be differentiated with the W/V atomic ratios reported in the last column. It can be seen that the V-only catalysts are very dilute whereas in the tungsten-con- taining samples the TiO2 appears to be largely covered by the sup- ported species, in particular at the higher vanadium oxide contents.
In Fig. 1, XRD patterns of some catalysts are compared with that of the titania hydrate, after the reference calcination. The diffracto- grams are dominated by the reflections of anatase, their consider- able width indicates a small primary particle size, which may be evaluated by the Scherrer equation. Particle sizes may be also esti- mated from the BET surface areas (Table 1) via dBET = 6/(qSBET),where q is the material density. For the titania hydrate, the BET surface area provides a much smaller particle size than XRD (dBET  6 nm, dXRD = 11.8 nm, from the (101) reflection). This suggests a strong surface roughness of the particles, a crystalline core being probably surrounded by an amorphous, porous overlay- er. With the loss of surface area due to the influence of the impreg- nated vanadium, the discrepancy decreased somewhat: for V5.0 the corresponding diameters were dBET  7.5 nm and dXRD = 11.4 nm.
The best coincidence was obtained with the tungsten-containing samples, which had experienced the intermediate calcination at 713 K. Here, the BET-derived sizes (13.7, 12.9, and 14.2 nm for
W10V1.5, W10V5.0, and V
5:0) compare well with 14.1, 12.2, and
15.0 nm obtained from the diffractograms.
For all catalysts, the presence of crystalline WO3 and V2O5 can be excluded on the basis of the diffractograms (Fig. 1) even in sam- ples where the theoretical surface coverage degree of the transition metal oxides is near or above 1 (cf. Table 1). There is a tiny hump at 2H = 26.65  in the diffractogram of V5.0, which is near to reflec- tions expected for WO3 and V2O5. The latter are, however, minor signals in the reflection patterns of the oxides, and the more prom- inent signals are missing. Apparently, the peak arises from minor amounts of quartz present in the sample analyzed ((101) reflec- tion at 26.64). There was not any V2O5 signal in the XRD pattern of V
5:0 either (not shown).
3.2. Catalytic properties
The catalytic activities of our catalysts are summarized in Fig. 2 where the temperature dependence of NO and NH3 conversions are shown and the temperature range above the calcination temper- ature has been shaded. The promotion effect of tungsten is clearly visible: at all vanadium contents, the conversion curve of the tung- sten-containing samples rises at lower temperature. The ammonia oxidation tendency was very low in all cases. From the curves in Fig. 2a through d, it is also obvious that the SCR activity increases with the vanadium content both in presence and absence of tung- sten. One may be tempted to examine the relation between activity and vanadium content from these data to confirm the more than proportional relation between them reported in [22,24]. We have attempted this despite the fact that for all suitable temperatures the conversions range from extremely small, not very accurate values till far outside the differential range.

239 data with an assumed first-order rate law, we indeed confirmed the expected more than proportional relation except for data points too close to the conversion maxima (e.g. in Fig. 2d), but due to the prob- lems mentioned above this result should not be overemphasized.
Remarkably, the promotion effect is very pronounced just at 5 wt.% V2O5 where a theoretical surface vanadium oxide coverage of 2025% should give rise to abundant VAOAV pair formation al- ready without promotion by tungsten.
3.3. Structural characterization of the vanadium phase
3.3.1. EPR spectroscopy
The EPR spectra of tungsten-free samples and tungsten-con- taining samples, all measured at 77 K, are compared in Fig. 3 on the same intensity scale. Examples for the spectral simulation are given in Fig. 4. The g and A values resulting from the simulation and the relative intensities Irel (related to the intensity of one of the hyperfine structure (hfs) signals) are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. These tables report also the parameter Dg/Dg\ (with Dg = g  ge, Dg\ = g\  ge; ge = 2.0023 for the free electron),which measures the axial distortion of the V4+ center [40,41],and the in-plane delocalization coefficient b2 2 [41], which is a mea- sure of the extent to which the single electron is delocalized toward the O ligands in the equatorial plane of the O4V@O site,i.e., for the degree of covalence of the VAO bonds. b2 2 was obtained from Eq. (1), where the element-specific parameter P, which covers the relation between Bohr magneton lb and nuclear magneton lN,was set to 184.5 G for a free V4+ ion [42]. b2 2  1 means total local- ization of the unpaired electron at the vanadium nucleus. b2 2  7 6 Dgjj  5 12 Dg?  7 6 Ajj  A?

1 The tungsten-free samples were dominated by a broad isotropic singlet which is due to the clustered VAOAV species (Fig. 3a) and increased with increasing vanadium loading. In addition, a hyper- fine structure signal typical of an isolated VO2+ species can be ob- served in all samples. In presence of tungsten, the isotropic singlet can be also discerned (Fig. 3b), but it is much less intense than in the tungsten-free catalysts. Instead, the signals of the iso- lated VO2+ species are more complicated, which suggests the pres- ence of at least two different sites. From the spectra, it should be expected that the intensity ratio between the isotropic signal and those of the isolated sites is much larger in the absence of tungsten.
These spectra have been simulated to derive the spectral parameters and relative intensity of signals. Apart from signals of isolated and clustered V4+ species, a signal for an O 2 species was included in the case of tungsten-containing catalysts. Such species had been observed on the bare TiO2 support and, with enhanced intensity,on the WO3/TiO2 precursor [36].
Notably,no tungsten-derived signals could be found on WO3/TiO2 [36], there- fore such signals were not included in the analysis of the V2O5AWO3/TiO2 catalysts. 400 500 600 700 0 20 40 60 80 100 400 500 600 700 0 20 40 60 80 100 400 500 600 700 0 20 40 60 80 100 400 500 600 700 0 20 40 60 80 100

Examples for the quality of the simulation are given in Fig. 4.
While a better coincidence between experimental and simulated signals would have been desirable in particular for the tungsten- free catalysts (cf. Fig. 4a, central part between 3250 and 3350 G),the major features are apparently reproduced by the model. Most of the divergences can be traced back to a limitation of the soft- ware which does not allow using different line widths for the indi- vidual hyperfine lines, although variations are obvious. In the V multiplets, the positions of the outermost A hyperfine lines at low and high field are well fitted in all cases which suggests that the number of superimposed signals and, thus, of different single VO2+ sites, and their basic parameters (g and A values) are basically correct.
In absence of tungsten, the hyperfine structure signal of isolated VO2+ could be fitted with almost identical parameters in all sam- ples (Table 2, species 1). Both axial distortion (Dg/Dg\ = 2.15) and degree of delocalization (b2 2  0:56) do not depend on the vanadia loading. At low vanadium content, a second hfs signal can be observed, but it could be simulated only for V0.5 (Table 2,species 2). This VO2 species has a slightly lower axial distortion (Dg/Dg\ = 1.96), and the unpaired electron is closer to the V4+ center (b2 2  0:77). However, compared to the signal of the clustered phase, the hfs signals are minor. In V0.5, the isotropic signal is 50 times more intense than the latter, and its predomi- nance increases with the vanadium content: in V5 the intensity ratio (Irel) is as large as 340, although the theoretical coverage of the surface V oxide species is on the order of only 0.2.
In the spectra of the tungsten-containing samples, two signals of isolated VO2 species were always found (Fig. 3b, Fig. 4bd, Table 3). The spectral parameters of these signals are different from 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 -40 -20 0 20 40 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500 -40 -20 0 20 40
