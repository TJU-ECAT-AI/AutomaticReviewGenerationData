In the realm of catalytic chemistry, the deactivation mechanisms, regeneration strategies, and performance optimization of metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium-based (Cr-based) and vanadium oxides (VOx), play pivotal roles in enhancing the efficiency of oxidative dehydrogenation processes. These processes are crucial for the conversion of hydrocarbons into valuable chemicals and fuels, but they are often challenged by issues such as coke formation and the generation of CO2, which can impede the overall process performance and economic viability.

Coke mitigation is a significant concern in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, as it leads to the accumulation of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface, causing a decrease in the catalyst's activity and selectivity over time. The deactivation mechanisms associated with coke formation involve the adsorption and subsequent polymerization of reaction products onto the catalyst surface, leading to a loss of active sites and reduced conversion efficiency. To address this challenge, researchers focus on developing catalysts with enhanced resistance to coke formation or employing post-reaction treatments that facilitate the removal of deposited coke.

CO2 utilization, on the other hand, represents an opportunity to mitigate environmental impacts while potentially increasing the economic benefits of the oxidative dehydrogenation process. By incorporating strategies that convert CO2 into valuable products, such as methanol or formic acid, the process not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also provides a means to valorize a waste product. This requires careful consideration of the catalyst design and operational conditions to ensure that CO2 can be effectively integrated into the reaction pathway without compromising the primary goal of hydrocarbon conversion.

Performance optimization of Cr-based and VOx catalysts involves a multifaceted approach, encompassing the selection of appropriate support materials, tuning the catalyst morphology, adjusting the catalyst loading, and optimizing operating parameters such as temperature, pressure, and feedstock composition. Additionally, the development of advanced analytical techniques to monitor catalyst activity and deactivation kinetics is essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms and guiding the design of more effective catalysts.

Regeneration strategies for these catalysts typically involve thermal or chemical methods aimed at removing deposited coke and restoring the catalyst's initial performance. Thermal regeneration might involve elevated temperatures to vaporize and remove coke deposits, while chemical regeneration could employ reagents that react with the coke to break its structure and release the carbon back into the gas phase. Both approaches aim to minimize catalyst loss and downtime, thereby enhancing the economic feasibility and sustainability of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
