[1] "In oxidative dehydrogenation processes, metal oxide catalysts, particularly those based on Cr and VOx, can experience deactivation. This deactivation is primarily due to the formation of various oxides and compounds that reduce the catalytic activity."
[2] "Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can be used to restore the catalytic performance of these metal oxide catalysts. Each method has its own effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance."
[3] "Adding CO2 to the process can potentially mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation process."

The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based and VOx catalysts used in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are attributed to the formation of various oxides and compounds that diminish their catalytic activity. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can be employed to recover the catalyst's performance. These methods vary in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Additionally, the incorporation of CO2 into the process can help alleviate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially improving the overall efficiency and selectivity of the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
