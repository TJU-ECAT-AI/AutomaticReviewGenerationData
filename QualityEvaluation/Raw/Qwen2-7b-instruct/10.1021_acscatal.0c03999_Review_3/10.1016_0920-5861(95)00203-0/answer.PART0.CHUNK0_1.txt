[1] "For supported metal oxide catalysts, the molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species under ambient conditions, where the surface is hydrated with a thin aqueous layer, are determined by the net pH at the pzc of the supported metal oxide system."
[2] "The molecular structures under dehydrated conditions are spontaneously formed by self assembly and can not be influenced by preparation methods."
[3] "The surface metal oxide species primarily coordinate to the oxide supports by titrating the surface hydroxyls of the supports."
[4] "Monolayer coverage of the surface metal oxide species generally corresponds to approximately 4-5 atoms/nm 2 for alumina, titania, zirconia and niobia supports."
[5] "For silica supported metal oxide catalysts, the surface density is influenced by the preparation method but not the molecular structures."
[6] "The number of surface Brnsted acid sites is determined by the specific oxide support and the surface coverage of the surface metal oxide species."
[7] "Under reaction conditions, the surface metal oxide species can be unchanged, hydrated, reduced to a lower oxidation state or transformed to a crystalline phase."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, poisoning, and sintering. In Cr-based catalysts, overoxidation can lead to the formation of高价氧化态, which decreases catalytic activity. For VOx catalysts, overoxidation can lead to the formation of VO2+, which is less active than VOx. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used to restore the catalyst's activity. Air reoxidation is effective but requires higher temperatures. CO2 reoxidation is more selective but less effective at lower temperatures. O2 reoxidation is the most effective but requires high temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by promoting the formation of less overoxidized species.

2. In silica-supported metal oxide catalysts, the surface density is influenced by the preparation method. Different preparation methods can enhance the surface coverage of the surface metal oxide species on silica to approximately a quarter of a monolayer, but these methods do not change the molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species.

3. The number of surface Brnsted acid sites on metal oxide catalysts is determined by the specific oxide support and the surface coverage of the surface metal oxide species. For silica-supported metal oxide catalysts, the surface density of surface metal oxide species can not be achieved, resulting in surface densities of 0.1-1 atoms/nm², which is influenced by the preparation method but not the molecular structures.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括过氧化、中毒和聚集。对于基于Cr的催化剂，过氧化可能导致高价氧化态的形成，从而降低催化活性。对于VOx催化剂，过氧化可能导致VO2+的形成，这比VOx活性低。各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的重新氧化，可以用于恢复催化剂的活性。空气再氧化是有效的，但需要更高的温度。CO2再氧化更具选择性，但在较低温度下效果较差。O2再氧化最有效，但需要高温。向VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以通过促进形成更少过氧化的物种来减轻过氧化。

2. 对于硅基支持的金属氧化物催化剂，表面密度受制备方法的影响。不同的制备方法可以在硅上增强表面金属氧化物种的表面覆盖度至大约四分之一的单层，但这些方法不会改变表面金属氧化物种的分子结构。

3. 金属氧化物催化剂上的表面Brnsted酸位的数量由特定的氧化物支持和表面金属氧化物种的表面覆盖率决定。对于硅基支持的金属氧化物催化剂，表面金属氧化物种的表面密度无法实现，导致表面密度为0.1-1原子/nm²，这是由制备方法影响的，而不是分子结构。
