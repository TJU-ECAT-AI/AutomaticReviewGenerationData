[1] "For supported metal oxide catalysts, the molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species under ambient conditions, where the surface is hydrated with a thin aqueous layer, are determined by the net pH at the pzc of the supported metal oxide system."
[2] "The molecular structures under dehydrated conditions are spontaneously formed by self assembly and can not be influenced by preparation methods."
[3] "The surface metal oxide species primarily coordinate to the oxide supports by titrating the surface hydroxyls of the supports."
[4] "Monolayer coverage of the surface metal oxide species generally corresponds to approximately 4-5 atoms/nm 2 for alumina, titania, zirconia and niobia supports."
[5] "For silica supported metal oxide catalysts, the surface density is influenced by the preparation method but not the molecular structures."
[6] "The number of surface Brnsted acid sites is determined by the specific oxide support and the surface coverage of the surface metal oxide species."
[7] "Under reaction conditions, the surface metal oxide species can be unchanged, hydrated, reduced to a lower oxidation state or transformed to a crystalline phase."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include overoxidation, poisoning, and sintering. In Cr-based catalysts, overoxidation can lead to the formation of高价氧化态, which decreases catalytic activity. For VOx catalysts, overoxidation can lead to the formation of VO2+, which is less active than VOx. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be used to restore the catalyst's activity. Air reoxidation is effective but requires higher temperatures. CO2 reoxidation is more selective but less effective at lower temperatures. O2 reoxidation is the most effective but requires high temperatures. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by promoting the formation of less overoxidized species.

2. In silica-supported metal oxide catalysts, the surface density is influenced by the preparation method. Different preparation methods can enhance the surface coverage of the surface metal oxide species on silica to approximately a quarter of a monolayer, but these methods do not change the molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species.

3. The number of surface Brnsted acid sites on metal oxide catalysts is determined by the specific oxide support and the surface coverage of the surface metal oxide species. For silica-supported metal oxide catalysts, the surface density of surface metal oxide species can not be achieved, resulting in surface densities of 0.1-1 atoms/nm², which is influenced by the preparation method but not the molecular structures.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括过氧化、中毒和聚集。对于基于Cr的催化剂，过氧化可能导致高价氧化态的形成，从而降低催化活性。对于VOx催化剂，过氧化可能导致VO2+的形成，这比VOx活性低。各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的重新氧化，可以用于恢复催化剂的活性。空气再氧化是有效的，但需要更高的温度。CO2再氧化更具选择性，但在较低温度下效果较差。O2再氧化最有效，但需要高温。向VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以通过促进形成更少过氧化的物种来减轻过氧化。

2. 对于硅基支持的金属氧化物催化剂，表面密度受制备方法的影响。不同的制备方法可以在硅上增强表面金属氧化物种的表面覆盖度至大约四分之一的单层，但这些方法不会改变表面金属氧化物种的分子结构。

3. 金属氧化物催化剂上的表面Brnsted酸位的数量由特定的氧化物支持和表面金属氧化物种的表面覆盖率决定。对于硅基支持的金属氧化物催化剂，表面金属氧化物种的表面密度无法实现，导致表面密度为0.1-1原子/nm²，这是由制备方法影响的，而不是分子结构。

[1] "The molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species under ambient conditions, where the surface is hydrated with a thin aqueous layer, are determined by the net pH at the pzc of the supported metal oxide system."
[2] "For many supported metal oxide systems (e.g.,metal oxides deposited on alumina, titania, zir- conia and niobia), the surface metal oxide species is preferentially formed up to monolayer coverage. At monolayer coverage, all the reactive surface hydroxyls of the support have been titrated and deposition of additional metal oxide results in the formation of microcrystalline metal oxide particles."
[3] "The distribution of surface Lewis and BrCnsted acid sites for alumina supported metal oxide catalysts have been extensively investigated. The number of surface BrCnsted acid sites can also be determined from the intensities of the PyL and PyH IR bands and their extinction coefficients after saturation of all the surface sites."
[4] "The oxidation states and structures of the surface metal oxide species can be altered by the reaction environment. The changes observed are both a function of the specific supported metal oxide catalyst system and the specific reaction environment."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and sintering. Overoxidation refers to the formation of more stable, less active oxides, often resulting in a loss of activity. Sintering involves the aggregation of catalyst particles, reducing surface area and thus catalytic efficiency. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore activity by removing accumulated byproducts or reactivating the catalyst.

2. Regeneration methods like reoxidation with air typically require high temperatures to effectively remove carbonaceous deposits and regenerate the catalyst. However, they can lead to overoxidation, especially in VOx-catalyzed reactions, which can degrade the catalyst's performance. Using CO2 for regeneration might mitigate overoxidation as it selectively removes carbon compounds without excessively oxidizing the catalyst. Oxygen regeneration can also be effective but might require careful control to avoid overoxidation.

3. In terms of effectiveness, reoxidation with CO2 might offer a balance between regenerating the catalyst without causing significant overoxidation. Its temperature requirement could be lower compared to air reoxidation, potentially preserving the catalyst's activity better. However, the impact on catalytic performance depends on the specific catalyst type and the reaction conditions.

4. The regeneration process using CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions aims to selectively remove carbon compounds without excessively oxidizing the VOx catalyst. This could help maintain or restore the catalyst's activity, potentially leading to improved catalytic performance over traditional air or oxygen reoxidation methods.

5. The number of surface BrCnsted acid sites on a catalyst is determined by the specific oxide support and the surface coverage of the metal oxide species. Changes in these factors can influence the acid site density and, consequently, the catalyst's acidity and activity, impacting its performance in various catalytic reactions.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因是过氧化和结块。过氧化指的是形成更稳定、活性较低的氧化物，导致活性下降。结块是指催化剂颗粒的聚集，减少表面积，从而降低催化效率。各种再生方法，如通过空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，旨在通过去除积累的副产品或重新激活催化剂来恢复活性。

2. 空气再生通常需要高温以有效去除碳沉积物并再生催化剂。然而，在VOx催化的反应中，这可能导致过度氧化，降低催化剂性能。使用CO2进行再生可能有助于减轻过氧化作用，因为它选择性地去除碳化合物，而不会过度氧化催化剂。氧气再生也可能有效，但可能需要仔细控制，以避免过氧化。

3. 在再生过程中使用CO2添加来减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，旨在选择性地去除碳化合物，同时避免过度氧化催化剂。这可能有助于保持或恢复催化剂的活性，从而提高其在传统空气或氧气再生方法下的催化性能。

4. 催化剂表面BrCnsted酸位的数量由特定的氧化物支持和金属氧化物物种的表面覆盖率决定。这些因素的变化可以影响酸位密度，进而影响催化剂的酸性和活性，影响其在各种催化反应中的性能。

5. 催化剂上BrCnsted酸位的数量由特定的氧化物支持和金属氧化物物种的表面覆盖率决定。这些因素的变化可以影响酸位密度，进而影响催化剂的酸性和活性，影响其在各种催化反应中的性能。
