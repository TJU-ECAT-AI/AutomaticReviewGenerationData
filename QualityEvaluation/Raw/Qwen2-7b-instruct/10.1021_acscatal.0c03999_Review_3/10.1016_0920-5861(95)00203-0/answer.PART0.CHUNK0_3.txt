Question: What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

Answer: The provided document does not contain information on the causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes or comparisons of regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. The document focuses on Raman and IR spectroscopy techniques used for characterizing supported metal oxide catalysts and does not delve into catalyst deactivation mechanisms or regeneration strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given text.
