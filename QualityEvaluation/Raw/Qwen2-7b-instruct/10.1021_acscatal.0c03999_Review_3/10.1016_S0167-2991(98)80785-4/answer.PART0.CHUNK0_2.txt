[1] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can mitigate deactivation. Among these, CO2 addition is particularly effective in maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface during the reaction, thereby enhancing catalytic performance and suppressing deactivation. Air reoxidation increases the oxygen content, potentially leading to overoxidation if not controlled. Oxygen reoxidation offers precise control over the oxygen level but may still lead to overoxidation under certain conditions. CO2 reoxidation, on the other hand, maintains the catalyst in a stable partially oxidized state, which is beneficial for maintaining high activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

在氧化脱氢过程中，针对Cr基和VOx催化剂的金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括过氧化和中毒。各种再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，可以缓解失活。在这之中，CO2添加特别有效于在反应期间维持催化剂表面部分氧化状态，从而增强催化性能并抑制失活。空气重新氧化增加了氧气含量，可能在控制不当的情况下导致过氧化。氧气重新氧化提供了对氧气水平的精确控制，但在某些条件下仍可能导致过氧化。CO2重新氧化则维持催化剂处于稳定的部分氧化状态，这对于保持高活性和选择性具有益处。
