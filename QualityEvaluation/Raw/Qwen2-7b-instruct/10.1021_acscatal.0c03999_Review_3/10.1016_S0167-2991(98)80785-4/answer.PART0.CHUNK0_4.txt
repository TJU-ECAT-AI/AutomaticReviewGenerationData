[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."
[2] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."
[4] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."

1. Carbon dioxide promotes the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation.
2. The surface of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst remains partially oxidized during reactions in the presence of carbon dioxide, which contributes to its sustained activity.
3. The SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst demonstrates enhanced activity for the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of carbon dioxide.

1. 二氧化碳仅对SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂产生促进作用，提高丙烷脱氢的产率并抑制催化剂失活。
2. 在二氧化碳存在的条件下，Cr203/SiO2催化剂表面保持部分氧化状态，这有助于其持续活性。
3. SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下表现出对丙烷脱氢的增强活性。
