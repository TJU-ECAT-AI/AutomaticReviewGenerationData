The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is typically attributed to overoxidation or sintering. Overoxidation occurs when the catalyst surface becomes too oxidized, leading to a loss of active sites and reduced activity. Sintering involves the agglomeration of catalyst particles, decreasing the specific surface area and thus affecting the reaction efficiency.

Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, aim to restore the catalyst's activity by removing the overoxidation layer or regenerating the active sites. Reoxidation with CO2 is particularly noted for its ability to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. This is because CO2 can react with the excess oxygen on the catalyst surface, effectively reducing it back to the active form. The temperature requirements for these methods vary, with CO2 reoxidation potentially offering a lower temperature alternative compared to direct reoxidation with air or O2, which may require higher temperatures to overcome the energy barrier associated with the reduction process.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the extent of overoxidation, the type of catalyst, and the reaction conditions. However, CO2 addition demonstrates promise in enhancing the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, potentially through its role in maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface during the reaction.

在氧化脱氢过程中，针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因通常归结为过氧化或烧结。过氧化发生在催化剂表面过度氧化时，导致活性位点损失和活性降低。烧结涉及催化剂颗粒的聚集，减少特定表面积，从而影响反应效率。

不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，旨在通过去除过氧化层或重新生成活性位点来恢复催化剂的活性。使用CO2进行再氧化特别值得注意，因为它能够与催化剂表面的过剩氧反应，有效地将其还原回活性形式。这些方法所需的温度要求各不相同，CO2再氧化可能提供比直接使用空气或O2再氧化更低的温度选择，后者可能需要更高的温度来克服与还原过程相关的能量壁垒。

这些方法的有效性取决于多种因素，包括过氧化的程度、催化剂的类型以及反应条件。然而，CO2的添加在增强C3H8在Cr203/SiO2催化剂上的脱氢速率方面显示出潜力，可能通过保持催化剂表面部分氧化状态的方式实现。
