[1] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[2] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are typically attributed to overoxidation, sintering, and poisoning. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition appears to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially maintaining the surface of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst partially oxidized during the reaction.

在氧化脱氢过程中，以Cr为基础和VOx催化剂为代表的金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因通常归结为过氧化、烧结和中毒。再生方法如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化在温度要求和催化性能影响方面可能有所不同。在存在CO2的情况下，Cr203/SiO2催化剂表面可能在反应期间保持部分氧化，这似乎能够减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。
