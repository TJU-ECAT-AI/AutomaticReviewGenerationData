[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning. Overoxidation involves the excessive oxidation of catalyst sites, leading to a loss of active surface area and reduced catalytic efficiency. Poisoning occurs when impurities or reactants adsorb onto the catalyst surface, blocking active sites and inhibiting reaction progress. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the catalyst's activity. Among these, reoxidation with CO2 is particularly effective in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, maintaining the partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface without causing significant deactivation.

氧化脱氢过程中，针对Cr基和VOx催化剂的催化剂失活的主要原因包括过氧化和中毒。过氧化指的是催化剂活性位点的过度氧化，导致有效表面积减少和催化效率降低。中毒则是指杂质或反应物吸附到催化剂表面，阻塞活性位点，抑制反应进程。各种再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，旨在恢复催化剂的活性。在这些方法中，使用CO2进行重新氧化特别有效地减轻了VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，保持了催化剂表面的部分氧化状态，而不会造成显著的失活。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are typically attributed to overoxidation, sintering, and poisoning. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition appears to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, potentially maintaining the surface of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst partially oxidized during the reaction.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can mitigate deactivation. Among these, CO2 addition is particularly effective in maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface during the reaction, thereby enhancing catalytic performance and suppressing deactivation. Air reoxidation increases the oxygen content, potentially leading to overoxidation if not controlled. Oxygen reoxidation offers precise control over the oxygen level but may still lead to overoxidation under certain conditions. CO2 reoxidation, on the other hand, maintains the catalyst in a stable partially oxidized state, which is beneficial for maintaining high activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is typically attributed to overoxidation or sintering. Overoxidation occurs when the catalyst surface becomes too oxidized, leading to a loss of active sites and reduced activity. Sintering involves the agglomeration of catalyst particles, decreasing the specific surface area and thus affecting the reaction efficiency.

Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, aim to restore the catalyst's activity by removing the overoxidation layer or regenerating the active sites. Reoxidation with CO2 is particularly noted for its ability to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. This is because CO2 can react with the excess oxygen on the catalyst surface, effectively reducing it back to the active form. The temperature requirements for these methods vary, with CO2 reoxidation potentially offering a lower temperature alternative compared to direct reoxidation with air or O2, which may require higher temperatures to overcome the energy barrier associated with the reduction process.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on factors such as the extent of overoxidation, the type of catalyst, and the reaction conditions. However, CO2 addition demonstrates promise in enhancing the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, potentially through its role in maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface during the reaction.

在氧化脱氢过程中，针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因通常归结为过氧化或烧结。过氧化发生在催化剂表面过度氧化时，导致活性位点损失和活性降低。烧结涉及催化剂颗粒的聚集，减少特定表面积，从而影响反应效率。

不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，旨在通过去除过氧化层或重新生成活性位点来恢复催化剂的活性。使用CO2进行再氧化特别值得注意，因为它能够与催化剂表面的过剩氧反应，有效地将其还原回活性形式。这些方法所需的温度要求各不相同，CO2再氧化可能提供比直接使用空气或O2再氧化更低的温度选择，后者可能需要更高的温度来克服与还原过程相关的能量壁垒。

这些方法的有效性取决于多种因素，包括过氧化的程度、催化剂的类型以及反应条件。然而，CO2的添加在增强C3H8在Cr203/SiO2催化剂上的脱氢速率方面显示出潜力，可能通过保持催化剂表面部分氧化状态的方式实现。
