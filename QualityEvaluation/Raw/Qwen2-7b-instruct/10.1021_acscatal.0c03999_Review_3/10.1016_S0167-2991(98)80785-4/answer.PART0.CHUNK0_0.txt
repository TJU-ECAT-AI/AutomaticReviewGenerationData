[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SIO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning. Overoxidation involves the excessive oxidation of catalyst sites, leading to a loss of active surface area and reduced catalytic efficiency. Poisoning occurs when impurities or reactants adsorb onto the catalyst surface, blocking active sites and inhibiting reaction progress. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore the catalyst's activity. Among these, reoxidation with CO2 is particularly effective in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, maintaining the partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface without causing significant deactivation.

氧化脱氢过程中，针对Cr基和VOx催化剂的催化剂失活的主要原因包括过氧化和中毒。过氧化指的是催化剂活性位点的过度氧化，导致有效表面积减少和催化效率降低。中毒则是指杂质或反应物吸附到催化剂表面，阻塞活性位点，抑制反应进程。各种再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，旨在恢复催化剂的活性。在这些方法中，使用CO2进行重新氧化特别有效地减轻了VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，保持了催化剂表面的部分氧化状态，而不会造成显著的失活。
