[1] "Among the possible active phases, V oxide (VOx) has been the most widely investigated, because when loaded in a proper amount on a suitable support, it leads to promising yields of ethylene [710], propylene [6,7,11,12], or butenes [8]."
[2] "The reaction can be kinetically modeled through a Mars van Krevelen mechanism centered on V reduction and subsequent reoxidation [6,12]."
[3] "The nature of such active sites has been widely investigated [13,18,19]; it seems that V5+ is dispersed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species,which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing V loading until a monolayer is formed."
[4] "As for selectivity, a possible role of the support cannot be excluded,especially with samples characterized by strong Lewis acidity [11]."
[5] "The catalysts described so far are usually prepared by impregnation, leading to deposition of vanadium onto the surface of the selected support."
[6] "The aim of the present work was to prepare by FP a set of nanostructured V-based catalysts characterized by different V loadings and to compare their performance in the ODH of propane with that of a sample prepared by impregnating a FP-prepared silica by a traditional procedure."

1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by overoxidation and the formation of carbon deposits. Overoxidation can lead to the formation of oxygenated species that deactivate the catalyst. Carbon deposition occurs when the reaction conditions are not favorable, leading to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface.

2. Regeneration methods for metal oxide catalysts typically involve reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Reoxidation with air is the most straightforward method, but it can lead to overoxidation and catalyst degradation. Reoxidation with CO2 is less aggressive than air but can still cause some catalyst damage. Oxygen reoxidation can be more effective in regenerating the catalyst while minimizing damage, but it requires careful control to prevent overoxidation.

3. CO2 addition during regeneration can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing a less reactive environment. This can help preserve the catalyst's active sites and structure, improving its performance post-regeneration. However, the effectiveness of CO2 addition depends on the reaction conditions and the specific catalyst properties.

Answer: Deactivation mechanisms for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are primarily related to overoxidation and carbon deposition. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition during regeneration can help mitigate overoxidation, preserving catalyst activity and structure.

1. Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是过氧化和碳沉积。过氧化会导致形成活性降低的氧化物，而碳沉积则是在反应条件不利时催化剂表面形成的焦炭。

2. 催化剂的再生方法通常包括使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化。使用空气进行再氧化是最直接的方法，但也可能导致催化剂过氧化和损害。使用CO2进行再氧化比使用空气温和，但仍可能对催化剂造成一些损害。使用氧气进行再氧化可能更有效于恢复催化剂性能，但需要仔细控制以防止过氧化。

3. 在再生过程中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化，提供一个相对不那么活跃的环境。这有助于保存催化剂的活性位点和结构，提高再生后催化剂的性能。然而，CO2添加的有效性取决于反应条件和特定催化剂的性质。

答案：Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的失效机制主要与过氧化和碳沉积有关。不同类型的再生方法（如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化）在有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。在再生过程中添加CO2可以帮助减轻过氧化，从而保存催化剂的活性位点和结构，提高再生后的催化剂性能。
