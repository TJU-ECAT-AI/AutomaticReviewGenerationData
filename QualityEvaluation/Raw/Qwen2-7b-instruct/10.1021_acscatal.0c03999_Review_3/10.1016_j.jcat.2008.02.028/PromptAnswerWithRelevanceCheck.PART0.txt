The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, sintering, and poisoning. Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by controlling the oxygen environment, leading to better selectivity and stability.

The effectiveness of different regeneration methods depends on several factors. Air reoxidation is simple but may cause overoxidation, leading to the formation of less active compounds like Cr2O3 or V2O5. Oxygen reoxidation is more selective but requires higher temperatures, potentially causing sintering and reducing catalyst surface area. CO2 reoxidation offers a moderate approach, providing a controlled oxygen environment that can prevent overoxidation while still restoring active sites.

Temperature requirements for these methods range from ambient conditions to over 500°C, with higher temperatures typically needed for oxygen reoxidation. The impact on catalytic performance includes changes in activity, selectivity, and stability. CO2 addition can help mitigate overoxidation by creating a protective layer around the catalyst, reducing the risk of further oxidation and preserving active sites. This leads to better selectivity and stability in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, especially under anaerobic conditions.

In summary, while the document focuses on the preparation and characterization of VOx/SiO2 catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, it does not directly address the question about metal oxide catalyst deactivation and regeneration methods. However, the principles discussed regarding catalyst dispersion, selectivity, and the role of oxygen in catalytic processes can be applied to understand the effectiveness of different regeneration strategies.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化、烧结和中毒。再生方法，如空气、二氧化碳或氧气重新氧化，其有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。二氧化碳添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过控制氧环境，从而提高选择性和稳定性。

不同再生方法的有效性取决于多个因素。空气再生简单，但可能导致过氧化，形成如Cr2O3或V2O5等活性较低的化合物。氧气再生更具有选择性，但需要更高的温度，可能造成烧结并减少催化剂表面积。二氧化碳再生提供了一种更为温和的方法，通过创造一个保护层围绕催化剂，减少进一步氧化的风险，同时保持活性位点，从而在无氧条件下提高选择性和稳定性。

这些方法的温度要求从室温到超过500°C不等，氧气再生通常需要更高的温度。对催化性能的影响包括活性、选择性和稳定性的变化。二氧化碳添加可以帮助减轻过氧化作用，通过在催化剂周围形成保护层，降低进一步氧化的风险，保留活性位点。这导致在氧化脱氢过程中选择性和稳定性的改善，特别是在无氧条件下。

综上所述，尽管文献主要关注用于氧化脱氢的VOx/SiO2催化剂的制备和表征，但它并未直接回答关于金属氧化物催化剂失效和再生方法的问题。然而，关于催化剂分散性、选择性和氧在催化过程中的作用的原则可以应用于理解不同再生策略的有效性。

[1] "Among the possible active phases, V oxide (VOx) has been the most widely investigated, because when loaded in a proper amount on a suitable support, it leads to promising yields of ethylene [710], propylene [6,7,11,12], or butenes [8]."
[2] "The nature of such active sites has been widely investigated [13,18,19]; it seems that V5+ is dispersed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species,which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing V loading until a monolayer is formed."

1. Among the active phases, VOx has been extensively studied due to its potential to yield high amounts of ethylene, propylene, and butenes when properly loaded on a suitable support.
2. The active sites of VOx catalysts tend to be dispersed as isolated vanadate species on the support, which then oligomerize and polymerize as the V loading increases, eventually forming a monolayer.
3. Typically, catalysts are prepared by impregnation, which involves depositing vanadium onto the surface of a selected support. No studies have been done on preparing nanostructured VOx-supported catalysts specifically for oxidative dehydrogenation applications.
4. The objective of the current research was to develop a series of nanostructured VOx-based catalysts with varying V loadings, and compare their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane against a catalyst prepared by impregnating a flame-pyrolyzed silica.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, poisoning by impurities, and coke formation on the catalyst surface. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can be used to restore the catalyst activity. Air reoxidation is the most common and generally requires the highest temperatures. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation issues by selectively removing oxygen species. O2 reoxidation provides a balance between reactivating the catalyst and preventing overoxidation. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the type of deactivation, the catalyst material, and the specific reaction conditions. CO2 addition can be particularly useful in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively removing oxygen species without causing excessive reoxidation.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by overoxidation and the formation of carbon deposits. Overoxidation can lead to the formation of oxygenated species that deactivate the catalyst. Carbon deposition occurs when the reaction conditions are not favorable, leading to the formation of coke on the catalyst surface.

2. Regeneration methods for metal oxide catalysts typically involve reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. Reoxidation with air is the most straightforward method, but it can lead to overoxidation and catalyst degradation. Reoxidation with CO2 is less aggressive than air but can still cause some catalyst damage. Oxygen reoxidation can be more effective in regenerating the catalyst while minimizing damage, but it requires careful control to prevent overoxidation.

3. CO2 addition during regeneration can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing a less reactive environment. This can help preserve the catalyst's active sites and structure, improving its performance post-regeneration. However, the effectiveness of CO2 addition depends on the reaction conditions and the specific catalyst properties.

Answer: Deactivation mechanisms for Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are primarily related to overoxidation and carbon deposition. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition during regeneration can help mitigate overoxidation, preserving catalyst activity and structure.

1. Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是过氧化和碳沉积。过氧化会导致形成活性降低的氧化物，而碳沉积则是在反应条件不利时催化剂表面形成的焦炭。

2. 催化剂的再生方法通常包括使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化。使用空气进行再氧化是最直接的方法，但也可能导致催化剂过氧化和损害。使用CO2进行再氧化比使用空气温和，但仍可能对催化剂造成一些损害。使用氧气进行再氧化可能更有效于恢复催化剂性能，但需要仔细控制以防止过氧化。

3. 在再生过程中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化，提供一个相对不那么活跃的环境。这有助于保存催化剂的活性位点和结构，提高再生后催化剂的性能。然而，CO2添加的有效性取决于反应条件和特定催化剂的性质。

答案：Cr基和VOx催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的失效机制主要与过氧化和碳沉积有关。不同类型的再生方法（如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化）在有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。在再生过程中添加CO2可以帮助减轻过氧化，从而保存催化剂的活性位点和结构，提高再生后的催化剂性能。
