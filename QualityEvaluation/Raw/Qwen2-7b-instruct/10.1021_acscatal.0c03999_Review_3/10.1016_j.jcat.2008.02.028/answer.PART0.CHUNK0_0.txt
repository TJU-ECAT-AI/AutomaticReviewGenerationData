[1] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another."
[2] "Lower dispersion can be achieved at the same V loading with the catalyst prepared by impregnation."
[3] "EPR revealed V4+O groups pointing out normally from the catalyst surface and sitting in the center of a surface array of oxygen atoms."
[4] "These V4+ groups helped demonstrate the difference in catalytic behavior of the various samples."
[5] "The best results were obtained with a 10 wt% V loading, which provided the best propylene yield among the samples, especially under anaerobic conditions (up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion)."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, sintering, and poisoning. Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by controlling the oxygen environment, leading to better selectivity and stability.

The effectiveness of different regeneration methods depends on several factors. Air reoxidation is simple but may cause overoxidation, leading to the formation of less active compounds like Cr2O3 or V2O5. Oxygen reoxidation is more selective but requires higher temperatures, potentially causing sintering and reducing catalyst surface area. CO2 reoxidation offers a moderate approach, providing a controlled oxygen environment that can prevent overoxidation while still restoring active sites.

Temperature requirements for these methods range from ambient conditions to over 500°C, with higher temperatures typically needed for oxygen reoxidation. The impact on catalytic performance includes changes in activity, selectivity, and stability. CO2 addition can help mitigate overoxidation by creating a protective layer around the catalyst, reducing the risk of further oxidation and preserving active sites. This leads to better selectivity and stability in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, especially under anaerobic conditions.

In summary, while the document focuses on the preparation and characterization of VOx/SiO2 catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation, it does not directly address the question about metal oxide catalyst deactivation and regeneration methods. However, the principles discussed regarding catalyst dispersion, selectivity, and the role of oxygen in catalytic processes can be applied to understand the effectiveness of different regeneration strategies.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化、烧结和中毒。再生方法，如空气、二氧化碳或氧气重新氧化，其有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。二氧化碳添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过控制氧环境，从而提高选择性和稳定性。

不同再生方法的有效性取决于多个因素。空气再生简单，但可能导致过氧化，形成如Cr2O3或V2O5等活性较低的化合物。氧气再生更具有选择性，但需要更高的温度，可能造成烧结并减少催化剂表面积。二氧化碳再生提供了一种更为温和的方法，通过创造一个保护层围绕催化剂，减少进一步氧化的风险，同时保持活性位点，从而在无氧条件下提高选择性和稳定性。

这些方法的温度要求从室温到超过500°C不等，氧气再生通常需要更高的温度。对催化性能的影响包括活性、选择性和稳定性的变化。二氧化碳添加可以帮助减轻过氧化作用，通过在催化剂周围形成保护层，降低进一步氧化的风险，保留活性位点。这导致在氧化脱氢过程中选择性和稳定性的改善，特别是在无氧条件下。

综上所述，尽管文献主要关注用于氧化脱氢的VOx/SiO2催化剂的制备和表征，但它并未直接回答关于金属氧化物催化剂失效和再生方法的问题。然而，关于催化剂分散性、选择性和氧在催化过程中的作用的原则可以应用于理解不同再生策略的有效性。
