[1] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another."

1. The active sites of the flame pyrolysis (FP)-prepared catalysts were highly dispersed vanadium pentoxide (V5+) groups partially incorporated into the silica matrix, interacting poorly with each other.

2. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis showed that V4+ oxygen groups typically protruded from the catalyst surface and were positioned at the center of an array of oxygen atoms.

3. Lower dispersion could be achieved at the same vanadium loading with a catalyst prepared through impregnation.

4. The catalytic activity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions demonstrated promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared catalysts.

5. The best results were achieved with a 10 wt% vanadium loading, offering the highest propylene yield among the samples, particularly under anaerobic conditions (up to 80% selectivity at 10% propane conversion).

6. The objective of the current research was to produce a series of nanostructured vanadium-based catalysts with varying vanadium loadings prepared by FP and compare their performance in propane oxidative dehydrogenation against a catalyst prepared by impregnating a FP-prepared silica with a traditional procedure.

1. 火焰热解（FP）制备的催化剂的活性位点表现为高度分散的五氧化二钒（V5+）组分，部分融入二氧化硅骨架中，并且彼此间相互作用较差。

2. 电子顺磁共振（EPR）结果显示，V4+氧组分通常从催化剂表面突出，并位于表面氧原子阵列的中心。

3. 相同的钒负载下，通过浸渍法可以实现较低的分散度。

4. 在厌氧和好氧条件下测量的催化活性表明，FP制备的催化剂具有令人满意的高选择性。

5. 最佳结果在10 wt%钒负载时获得，该负载提供样品中最高的丙烯产率，尤其是在厌氧条件下（10%丙烷转化时高达80%选择性）。

6. 当前研究的目标是通过FP方法制备一系列不同钒负载的纳米结构的钒基催化剂，并与通过传统程序浸渍FP预处理的二氧化硅的催化剂进行比较，以评估其在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的性能。
