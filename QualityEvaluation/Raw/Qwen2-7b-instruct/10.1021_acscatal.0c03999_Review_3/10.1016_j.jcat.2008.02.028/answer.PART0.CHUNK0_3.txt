[1] "The active sites of the FP-prepared catalysts appeared as highly dispersed V5+O groups partly incorporated into the silica matrix and interacting poorly with one another."

[2] "Lower dispersion can be achieved at the same V loading with the catalyst prepared by impregnation."

[3] "EPR revealed V4+O groups pointing out normally from the catalyst surface and sitting in the center of a surface array of oxygen atoms."

[4] "Catalytic activity measured under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions revealed a promisingly high selectivity with the FP-prepared samples."

[5] "This is likely related to the much higher dispersion of the VOx species in the FP-prepared samples, which also helps reduce the coke formation triggered by exposed surface acid sites."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, poisoning by impurities, and coke formation on the catalyst surface. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, can be used to restore the catalyst activity. Air reoxidation is the most common and generally requires the highest temperatures. CO2 reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation issues by selectively removing oxygen species. O2 reoxidation provides a balance between reactivating the catalyst and preventing overoxidation. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the type of deactivation, the catalyst material, and the specific reaction conditions. CO2 addition can be particularly useful in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively removing oxygen species without causing excessive reoxidation.

氧化脱氢过程中的金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括过氧化、杂质中毒以及催化剂表面焦炭形成。针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，可用于恢复催化剂活性。空气再氧化是最常见且通常需要最高温度的方法。CO2再氧化能通过选择性去除氧物种来缓解过氧化问题。O2再氧化提供了一种在重新激活催化剂的同时防止过氧化的平衡。这些方法的有效性取决于失活类型、催化剂材料以及特定反应条件。在VOx催化反应中，添加CO2特别有用，因为它能通过选择性去除氧物种而不会造成过度再氧化的方式缓解过氧化问题。
