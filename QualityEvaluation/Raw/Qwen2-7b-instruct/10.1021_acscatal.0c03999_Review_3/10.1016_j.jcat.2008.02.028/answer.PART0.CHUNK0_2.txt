[1] "Among the possible active phases, V oxide (VOx) has been the most widely investigated, because when loaded in a proper amount on a suitable support, it leads to promising yields of ethylene [710], propylene [6,7,11,12], or butenes [8]."
[2] "The nature of such active sites has been widely investigated [13,18,19]; it seems that V5+ is dispersed on the support in the form of isolated vanadate species,which progressively oligomerize and polymerize with increasing V loading until a monolayer is formed."
[3] "The catalysts described so far are usually prepared by impregnation, leading to deposition of vanadium onto the surface of the selected support. To the best of our knowledge, to date no study has been carried out on the possible preparation of nanostructured V-supported catalysts for the present application."
[4] "The aim of the present work was to prepare by FP a set of nanostructured V-based catalysts characterized by different V loadings and to compare their performance in the ODH of propane with that of a sample prepared by impregnating a FP-prepared silica by a traditional procedure."

1. Among the active phases, VOx has been extensively studied due to its potential to yield high amounts of ethylene, propylene, and butenes when properly loaded on a suitable support.
2. The active sites of VOx catalysts tend to be dispersed as isolated vanadate species on the support, which then oligomerize and polymerize as the V loading increases, eventually forming a monolayer.
3. Typically, catalysts are prepared by impregnation, which involves depositing vanadium onto the surface of a selected support. No studies have been done on preparing nanostructured VOx-supported catalysts specifically for oxidative dehydrogenation applications.
4. The objective of the current research was to develop a series of nanostructured VOx-based catalysts with varying V loadings, and compare their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane against a catalyst prepared by impregnating a flame-pyrolyzed silica.

1. 在活性组分中，VOx被广泛研究，因为它在适当的负载量和合适的支持物上，可以产生高产量的乙烯、丙烯和丁烯。
2. VOx催化剂的活性位点倾向于以孤立的钒酸盐形式分散在支持物上，随着V负载量的增加，这些物种逐渐聚合并聚合，最终形成单层。
3. 目前，催化剂通常通过浸渍法制备，该方法涉及将钒沉积到选定支持物的表面上。迄今为止，并没有专门针对氧化脱氢化应用准备纳米结构的VOx支持催化剂的研究。
4. 当前研究的目标是开发一系列不同V负载量的纳米结构VOx基催化剂，并与通过火焰热解硅胶浸渍传统方法制备的催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢化性能上的表现进行比较。
