[1] "The nature of the vanadium species anchored on the surface of the SBA-15 support, especially the role of the pore diameter of the catalyst during the selective oxidation of propane, remained to be established."
[2] "It is observed that propane could only be poorly converted over parent SBA-15, whereas the introduction of V remarkably enhanced propane conversion and the selectivity for partial oxidation products."
[3] "The present superior performance of the V-SBA catalysts in the oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane is a consequence of the greater den- sity of active species with a lower surface acidity achieved on the surface of the SBA-15 support as suggested from the detailed characterization results presented above."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of overoxidized species and interactions with acidic sites. For Cr-based and VOx catalysts, reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective methods for regenerating catalysts. Reoxidation with air typically requires higher temperatures than CO2 or O2. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by reducing the formation of overoxidized species. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因包括过度氧化物种的形成和与酸性位点的相互作用。对于Cr基和VOx催化剂，空气、CO2或O2的再氧化是有效的再生方法。与空气相比，CO2或O2的再氧化通常需要更高的温度。在VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以减少过度氧化物种的形成，从而缓解过氧化。这些方法的有效性取决于特定的催化剂和反应条件。
