[1] "In the field of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, it has been well established that the limited propy- lene selectivity at higher propane conversions is linked with propylene adsorption on acid sites and their subsequent com- bustion to carbon oxides."
[2] "As a consequence, VOx/MCM catalysts displayed high produc- tivities, keeping high selectivities to propylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "However, a fundamental understanding of the na- ture and redox properties of the vanadium species anchored on the surface of the SBA-15 support, especially the role of the pore diameter of the catalyst during the selective oxida- tion of propane, remained to be established."
[4] "The high dispersion of vanadium species achievable on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters as well as the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst is considered to be re- sponsible for the superior catalytic behavior of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

[1] "Investigations by means of UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have confirmed that at low V content (be- low 2.8 wt%), the surface of V-SBA is mainly covered by highly dispersed tetrahedral V5+ species and low polymeric VOV entities."
[2] "At higher V loading, polymeric vanadium species become more abundant, and at 4.5 wt%, octahe- dral V5+ forming the oxide phase also appears."
[3] "The 51V MAS NMR and UVvis spectra of the samples recorded under ambient conditions show that most vanadium species are able to coordi- nate additional water molecules and therefore are located in easily accessible sites."
[4] "Compared to the visible Raman spectra as reported in our preceding paper [29], the present UV-Raman spec- trae of the V-SBA samples show significant differences in the 8501050 cm1 range."
[5] "Characterization by FTIR/pyridine adsorption has con- firmed the formation of VOH groups corresponding to weak acidic Brnsted sites as well as the generation of new Lewis acid sites over the vanadium-containing VSBA samples."
[6] "Moreover, the temperature-programmed pyridine desorption reveals that both the strength and the density of the acid sites on the V-SBA sample are much weaker/or lower compared with the V-MCM and VSiO2 samples, suggesting the weak nature of the acid sites developed on the V-loaded SBA-15 catalysts."
[7] "The high dispersion of vanadium species achievable on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters as well as the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst is considered to be re- sponsible for the superior catalytic behavior of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are often related to overoxidation and the formation of polymeric species. In the context of VOx catalysts, the deactivation is influenced by the dispersion of vanadium species and the surface acidity. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Among these, CO2 addition is highlighted as a potentially effective approach for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

The effectiveness of these regeneration methods varies. Reoxidation with air typically leads to a complete restoration of the catalyst's activity but requires high temperatures, which can lead to sintering and loss of surface area. Reoxidation with CO2 or O2 is less aggressive and can be conducted at lower temperatures, preserving the catalyst's morphology and surface area. CO2 addition is particularly noted for its ability to selectively remove the overoxidation products without significantly impacting the active sites, thus enhancing the catalyst's performance.

In summary, while each method has its merits and drawbacks, CO2 addition emerges as a promising strategy for regenerating VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, offering a balance between activity restoration and preservation of the catalyst's structure.

在氧化脱氢反应中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的失活主要由过氧化和聚合物种的形成引起。对于VOx催化剂而言，活性丧失受到分散的钒物种和表面酸性的影响。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，在其有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。其中，CO2添加特别被强调为在VOx催化反应中缓解过氧化的有效途径。

这些再生方法的效果各不相同。通过空气进行再氧化通常能够完全恢复催化剂的活性，但需要高温，这可能导致烧结和表面积损失。而使用CO2或O2进行再氧化则较为温和，可以在较低温度下进行，从而保存催化剂的形态和表面积。CO2添加特别指出，其能够选择性地去除过氧化产物，而不显著影响活性位点，从而提高催化剂的性能。

简而言之，虽然每种方法都有其优点和缺点，但CO2添加被证明是再生VOx催化剂的一种有前景的方法，能够在活性恢复与保持催化剂结构之间实现平衡。

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the reduction in propylene selectivity at higher propane conversions is associated with propylene adsorption on acidic sites, followed by its combustion to carbon oxides. 

2. As vanadium loading increases beyond 5 wt% in V2O5/SiO2 catalysts, both the dispersion of vanadium species and the propylene selectivity decrease drastically.

3. Polymerized vanadium species on the surface of silica can negatively impact propylene selectivity and catalyst activity due to vanadium atoms that are not accessible to propane reactant molecules.

4. The vanadium species formed on siliceous or mesoporous SBA-15 supports exhibit a similar nature.

5. The present UV-Raman spectra of the V-SBA samples display notable differences in the 8501050 cm1 range compared to the visible Raman spectra.

6. FTIR/pyridine adsorption analysis confirms the presence of VOH groups indicative of weak Brnsted acidic sites and the creation of new Lewis acidic sites on vanadium-containing VSBA samples.

7. The high dispersion of vanadium species on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters and the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst contribute to the superior catalytic performance of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of overoxidized species and interactions with acidic sites. For Cr-based and VOx catalysts, reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective methods for regenerating catalysts. Reoxidation with air typically requires higher temperatures than CO2 or O2. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by reducing the formation of overoxidized species. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions.
