1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the reduction in propylene selectivity at higher propane conversions is associated with propylene adsorption on acidic sites, followed by its combustion to carbon oxides. 

2. As vanadium loading increases beyond 5 wt% in V2O5/SiO2 catalysts, both the dispersion of vanadium species and the propylene selectivity decrease drastically.

3. Polymerized vanadium species on the surface of silica can negatively impact propylene selectivity and catalyst activity due to vanadium atoms that are not accessible to propane reactant molecules.

4. The vanadium species formed on siliceous or mesoporous SBA-15 supports exhibit a similar nature.

5. The present UV-Raman spectra of the V-SBA samples display notable differences in the 8501050 cm1 range compared to the visible Raman spectra.

6. FTIR/pyridine adsorption analysis confirms the presence of VOH groups indicative of weak Brnsted acidic sites and the creation of new Lewis acidic sites on vanadium-containing VSBA samples.

7. The high dispersion of vanadium species on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters and the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst contribute to the superior catalytic performance of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中，丙烯选择性降低与丙烯在酸性位点吸附及其随后燃烧生成碳氧化物相关联。

2. 当V2O5/SiO2催化剂中的钒负载超过5 wt%时，两者分散性和丙烯选择性会急剧下降。

3. 硅酸盐表面聚合化的钒物种不仅对丙烯选择性有不利影响，而且可能由于无法接触丙烷反应分子的钒原子而对催化剂活性产生负面影响。

4. 在硅酸盐或介孔SBA-15支持上形成的钒物种具有相似的性质。

5. 与我们先前报告的可见拉曼光谱相比，现V-SBA样品的紫外拉曼光谱在850-1050 cm1范围内显示出显著差异。

6.FTIR/吡啶吸附分析证实了VOH组的存在，指示弱Brnsted酸性位点和范德华含钒VSBA样品的生成新Lewis酸位点。

7. SBA-15支持上的高分散的钒物种以及相对较低的表面酸性是导致V-SBA催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出优越催化性能的原因。
