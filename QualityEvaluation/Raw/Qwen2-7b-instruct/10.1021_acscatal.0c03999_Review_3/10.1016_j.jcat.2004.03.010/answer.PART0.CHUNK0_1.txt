[1] "The comparative study of the V-SBA and V-MCM-41 and the conventional VSiO2 catalysts has shown that a higher concentration of isolated V species is readily achievable on the surface of the SBA-15 support."
[2] "Moreover, a much weaker and lower acidity of the surface acid sites is observed for the vanadium-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts."
[3] "The high dispersion of vanadium species achievable on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters as well as the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst is considered to be responsible for the superior catalytic behavior of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

1. The study indicates that on the surface of the SBA-15 support, a higher concentration of isolated vanadium species can be easily attained compared to V-MCM-41 and VSiO2 catalysts. 
2. The surface acidity of the acid sites on the vanadium-incorporated SBA-15 catalysts is notably weaker and lower than that on other catalysts.
3. The high dispersion of vanadium species on the SBA-15 support, along with the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst, is considered responsible for the superior catalytic performance of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 研究表明，在SBA-15支持表面，可以轻易获得比V-MCM-41和VSiO2催化剂更高的孤立钒物种浓度。
2. V-SBA-15催化剂上的表面酸性位点明显较弱且较低。
3. SBA-15支持上高分散的钒物种以及催化剂相对较低的表面酸性被认为是V-SBA催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢中表现出优越催化性能的原因。
