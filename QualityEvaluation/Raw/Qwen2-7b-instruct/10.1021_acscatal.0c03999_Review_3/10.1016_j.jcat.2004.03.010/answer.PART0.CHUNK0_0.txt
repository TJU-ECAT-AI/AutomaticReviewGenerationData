[1] "In the field of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, it has been well established that the limited propy- lene selectivity at higher propane conversions is linked with propylene adsorption on acid sites and their subsequent com- bustion to carbon oxides."
[2] "As a consequence, VOx/MCM catalysts displayed high produc- tivities, keeping high selectivities to propylene during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "However, a fundamental understanding of the na- ture and redox properties of the vanadium species anchored on the surface of the SBA-15 support, especially the role of the pore diameter of the catalyst during the selective oxida- tion of propane, remained to be established."
[4] "The high dispersion of vanadium species achievable on the SBA-15 support with large pore diameters as well as the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst is considered to be re- sponsible for the superior catalytic behavior of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."

1. The limited propylene selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is often attributed to propylene adsorption on acidic sites, leading to subsequent combustion into carbon oxides.

2. Vanadium oxide/MCM catalysts showed high productivity and maintained high propylene selectivity during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

3. There was a lack of understanding regarding the nature and redox properties of vanadium species anchored on the surface of the SBA-15 support, particularly the role of pore diameter in selective oxidation of propane.

4. The superior catalytic performance of the V-SBA catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is attributed to the high dispersion of vanadium species on the SBA-15 support, along with the relatively low surface acidity of the catalyst.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中，丙烯选择性的限制通常归因于丙烯在酸性位点上的吸附及其随后的燃烧生成碳氧化物。

2. 硼硅酸盐MCM催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中显示出了高产率，并且保持了高丙烯选择性。

3. 对于SA-15支持表面的钒物种的性质和还原性特性，特别是孔径在选择性氧化丙烷中的作用，仍需进一步研究。

4. V-SBA催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中的优越催化性能归因于SA-15支撑上高分散的钒物种以及催化剂相对较低的表面酸性。
