[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "In addition, exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst yields propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[5] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[6] "Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[7] "Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke deposition and reduction of active sites, particularly the conversion of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states into the inactive Cr2+ state. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition shows promise in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by improving the oxidizing ability of CO2 and maintaining a stable selectivity for propylene. The Ni-promoted catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production by inducing the dissociation of CO2, activating O (O*ads), and regenerating the reduced CrOx through a series of chemical transformations.

氧化脱氢化过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的降解，尤其是将配位不饱和的Cr3+状态转化为无活性的Cr2+状态。各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的氧化重做，根据其效率、温度需求和对催化性能的影响而有所不同。在VOx催化的反应中，通过提高CO2的氧化能力并保持丙烯选择性的稳定，CO2的添加显示出抑制过氧化的潜力。Ni促进型催化剂通过诱导CO2分解成CO和激活O（O*ads），并进一步通过一系列化学转换，再生还原的CrOx，从而增强丙烯生产的稳定性。
