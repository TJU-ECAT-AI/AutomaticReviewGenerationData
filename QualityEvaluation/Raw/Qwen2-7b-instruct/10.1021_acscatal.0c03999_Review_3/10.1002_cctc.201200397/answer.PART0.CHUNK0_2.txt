[1] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state.1416"
[2] "The oxidizing power can be improved by the addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2. The deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst was decreased by the addition of a small amount of O2.20 Unfortunately, the selectivity of the reaction for C3H6 was decreased significantly."
[3] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx. Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke deposition and CrOx reduction. This leads to the conversion of the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. The addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2 can improve the oxidizing power and decrease the deactivation rate of CrOx/silica catalysts. However, this may decrease the selectivity for C3H6 significantly. Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 to CO and generates activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx, enhancing the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因包括焦炭沉积和CrOx还原。这会导致活性位点从未配位的Cr3+状态转化为不活跃的Cr2+状态。将少量O2作为CO2的共反应物添加到反应物中可以提高氧化能力并降低CrOx/silica催化剂的失活速率。然而，这可能会显著降低C3H6的选择性。Ni促进CO2分解为CO并生成激活氧（O*ads），从而再生还原的CrOx，增强丙烯在ODHP反应中的催化稳定性。
