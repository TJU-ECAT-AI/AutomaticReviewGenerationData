The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke deposition and CrOx reduction, which converts the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. CO2 has limited oxidizing ability in reoxidation of the reduced CrOx due to its thermodynamically stable properties. The selectivity for C3H6 decreases significantly when using CrOx catalysts. Adding Ni to the catalyst enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, enabling its dissociation to CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. The Ni-promoted catalyst shows high stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation process by maintaining the active phase of its Cr3+ states, thus reducing deactivation and allowing regeneration of active sites. The ex situ XPS measurements reveal that the non-promoted catalyst rapidly transforms active sites, reducing active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+, whereas Ni maintains the catalyst in the Cr3+ state, enabling regeneration.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）的主要失活原因包括焦炭沉积和CrOx还原，这将活性的Cr3+状态转化为不活跃的Cr2+状态。CO2在重新氧化还原CrOx方面的氧化能力有限，主要是由于其热力学稳定性质。在非促进型催化剂中，选择性显著降低C3H6的反应。添加Ni到催化剂中可以增强CO2的氧化能力，使其分解为CO和激活的O（O*吸附），从而再生还原的CrOx。促进的Ni催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中表现出高度稳定性，通过保持其Cr3+状态的活性相，从而减少失活并实现活性位点的再生。通过X射线光电子能谱（XPS）测量发现，非促进催化剂迅速转变活性位点，将活性Cr3+降低为不活性Cr2+，而Ni则保持催化剂在Cr3+状态下，从而实现再生。
