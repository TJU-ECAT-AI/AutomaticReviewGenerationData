[1] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state.1416"
[2] "CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties.19"
[3] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[4] "In terms of catalytic activity, the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to the 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si) catalyst resulted in a higher CO2 conversion and the stable production of propylene."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke deposition and the reduction of the active Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state. CO2 has limited ability to reoxidize the reduced CrOx due to its thermodynamic stability. The addition of Ni to the catalyst facilitates the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. This leads to improved catalytic activity, specifically a higher CO2 conversion and stable production of propylene, when 0.5wt% Ni is added to the 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因包括焦炭沉积和活性Cr3+状态转化为无活性的Cr2+状态。由于其热力学稳定性，CO2在重新氧化还原的CrOx方面的能力有限。向催化剂中添加Ni有助于将CO2分解为CO和激活氧（O*ads），从而再生还原的CrOx。当在10wt% Cr/Si催化剂中添加0.5wt% Ni时，这会导致更高的CO2转化率和稳定的丙烯产量，从而提高催化活性。
