[1] "The findings reported herein indicate that after the addition of 0.5wt% Ni to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity was stable and the selectivity was high."
[2] "Reduced CrOx was easily regenerated by the addition of Ni, as evidenced by a three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction analysis."
[3] "In addition, exsitu XPS results revealed that Cr3+ was maintained only in the Ni-promoted catalyst whereas Cr3+ was easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction."
[4] "The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst yields propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[5] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[6] "Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[7] "Consequently, the Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke deposition and reduction of active sites, particularly the conversion of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ states into the inactive Cr2+ state. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition shows promise in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by improving the oxidizing ability of CO2 and maintaining a stable selectivity for propylene. The Ni-promoted catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production by inducing the dissociation of CO2, activating O (O*ads), and regenerating the reduced CrOx through a series of chemical transformations.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by coke deposition and CrOx reduction. This conversion of the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state leads to deactivation. CO2 can mitigate this issue by serving as an oxygen transfer agent or a soft oxidant, preventing coke deposition and allowing the reduced active phase to be reoxidized. Adding O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2 can also decrease the deactivation rate of the catalyst.

2. In the oxidative dehydrogenation process, CO2 addition is effective in enhancing the oxidizing ability of CO2, enabling its dissociation and providing activated oxygen (O*ads) which regenerates the reduced CrOx phase back to the active Cr3+ state.

3. The addition of O2 in the reactant as a cofeed with CO2 can decrease the deactivation rate of the CrOx/silica catalyst, thereby improving its performance in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

4. The presence of Ni in the CrOx/silica catalyst promotes the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads), which in turn regenerates the reduced CrOx phase, enhancing the catalyst's stability in the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

5. The addition of Ni to the CrOx/silica catalyst changes the Cr phase, resulting in the formation of new peaks centered at approximately 200 and 500°C during the temperature-programmed reduction analysis.

6. The Ni-promoted catalyst maintains the Cr3+ state throughout the catalytic reaction, indicating that the active sites are preserved, thus reducing catalyst deactivation and enhancing its stability.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中，特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂，主要由于焦炭沉积和CrOx还原导致失活。这种将可协调的不饱和Cr3+状态转化为无活性的Cr2+状态的过程导致了催化剂的失活。CO2可以通过充当氧传输剂或软氧化剂来解决这个问题，防止焦炭沉积并允许还原的活性相重新氧化。向反应物中添加O2作为与CO2共喂料也可以降低催化剂的失活速率。

2. 在氧化脱氢过程中，通过添加CO2可以增强CO2的氧化能力，使其分解并提供激活的氧气（O*ads），从而再生还原的CrOx相回至活性Cr3+状态。

3. 向反应物中添加O2作为与CO2共喂料可以降低CrOx/silica催化剂的失活速率，从而提高其在氧化脱氢反应中的性能。

4. 添加Ni到CrOx/silica催化剂中促进了CO2的分解为CO和激活的O（O*ads），进而再生还原的CrOx相，增强了催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的稳定性。

5. Ni添加到CrOx/silica催化剂中改变了Cr相，在温度程序化减少分析中形成了位于约200°C和500°C的新峰。

6. Ni促进的催化剂在整个催化反应中保持Cr3+状态，表明活性位点得到保留，从而减少了催化剂的失活并提高了其稳定性。
