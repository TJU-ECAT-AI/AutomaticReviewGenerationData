1. The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is the formation of Cr3+ species in Cr-based catalysts and vanadyl complexes in VOx catalysts, which can affect the surface structure and reactivity.
2. Reoxidation with air is more effective than reoxidation with CO2 or O2 in regenerating VOx catalysts. The temperature requirements for regeneration vary, with higher temperatures leading to faster regeneration but potentially affecting the catalyst's stability.
3. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by acting as a sink for excess oxygen, thus reducing the risk of overoxidation.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是Cr基催化剂中的Cr3+物种形成，以及VOx催化剂中范德华络合物的形成，这会影响表面结构和反应性。
2. 在再生VOx催化剂时，使用空气比使用CO2或O2更为有效。再生所需的温度范围不同，较高的温度通常会导致更快的再生，但可能影响催化剂的稳定性。
3. 在VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以缓解过氧化，因为它可以作为过剩氧气的吸收剂，从而降低过氧化的风险。
