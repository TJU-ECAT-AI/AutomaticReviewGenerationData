1. The main reasons for metal oxide catalyst deactivation are sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation.
2. Reoxidation with air is usually more effective than with CO2 or O2 because of its higher oxygen concentration.
3. The temperature requirements for reoxidation differ based on the catalyst type and the chosen regeneration method.
4. Adding CO2 during the reaction process can help reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation.

1. 催化剂失活的主要原因是烧结、中毒和过氧化。
2. 使用空气进行再氧化通常比使用二氧化碳或氧气更有效，因为其氧浓度更高。
3. 再氧化所需的温度根据催化剂类型和所用再生方法的不同而不同。
4. 在反应过程中添加二氧化碳可以有助于减少VOx催化氧化脱氢过程中的过氧化。
