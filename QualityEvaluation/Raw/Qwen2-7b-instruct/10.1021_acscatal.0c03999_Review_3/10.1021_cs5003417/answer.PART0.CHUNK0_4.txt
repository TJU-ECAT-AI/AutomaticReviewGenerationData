The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air or oxygen are effective, while reoxidation with carbon dioxide can lead to more severe deactivation due to its stronger interaction with the catalyst surface. Temperature requirements for reoxidation vary significantly depending on the specific catalyst and the type of reoxidant used. Higher temperatures can facilitate faster reoxidation but may also increase sintering and deactivation. The addition of CO2 to VOx-catalyzed reactions can mitigate overoxidation if controlled properly, but excessive CO2 can lead to more severe deactivation of the catalyst.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（如Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因包括烧结、中毒和过氧化。再氧化方法，如用空气或氧气再氧化，可以有效地再生催化剂，而用二氧化碳再氧化可能会导致更严重的失效，因为二氧化碳与催化剂表面的相互作用更强。再氧化所需的温度要求因具体的催化剂和所使用的再氧化剂类型而异。一般来说，更高的温度有助于更快的再氧化，但也可能增加烧结和失效。向VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以缓解过氧化，但如果控制得当，可以有效。然而，过多的CO2可能导致催化剂更严重的失效。
