The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include poisoning effects from CO2 over γ-Al2O3 and limitations in using active carbon due to periodic regeneration with air. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. For example, reoxidation with air can lead to overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, whereas CO2 addition may mitigate overoxidation.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的失活主要原因是γ-Al2O3上的CO2中毒效应以及使用活性碳在空气周期再生时的限制。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。例如，在VOx催化反应中，空气重新氧化可能导致过氧化，而CO2添加可能有助于缓解过氧化。

[1] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[2] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[3] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning effects. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Reoxidation with air is generally more effective but requires higher temperatures compared to reoxidation with CO2 or O2. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by acting as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. The dealumination process has a significant impact on the catalytic properties of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, leading to improved performance. The low acidity of SiBeta supports high selectivity to propene, whereas the high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In the switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene is higher over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts when CO2 is present, while a negative effect on propene formation rate is observed over Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因包括过氧化和毒化效应。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的重新氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响有所不同。与空气重新氧化相比，空气重新氧化通常更有效，但需要更高的温度。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过作为氧化脱氢途径中的温和氧化剂。去铝化过程对Cr含量为2 wt %的Beta沸石催化剂的催化性质有显著影响，导致性能改善。低酸性的SiBeta有利于丙烯的高选择性，而高酸性的AlBeta则促进丙烷裂解为轻质烃类。在丙烷脱氢操作模式的切换中，在CO2存在与否的情况下，仅当CO2存在时，Cr含量为SiBeta沸石催化剂的丙烯形成速率更高，而在Cr含量为AlBeta催化剂上观察到丙烯形成速率的负效应。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are overoxidation and poisoning effects. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have varying effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

Overoxidation refers to the excessive oxidation state of the metal oxide catalyst, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. Poisoning effects occur when impurities or inhibitors in the feedstock bind to the catalyst surface, reducing its efficiency. The regeneration methods aim to restore the catalyst's original activity and selectivity. Air reoxidation is common but may lead to high temperatures, potentially causing structural damage. CO2 reoxidation offers a milder alternative, potentially reducing the risk of structural damage while still regenerating the catalyst. Oxygen reoxidation is effective but requires careful control to prevent overheating and potential catalyst destruction.

CO2 addition to the reaction mixture can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by acting as a mild oxidant. This allows for more controlled oxidation states of the catalyst, preserving its activity and selectivity during the dehydrogenation process.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化和中毒效应。针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，再生方法如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化在有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面有所不同。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化的反应中的过氧化作用。

过氧化是指催化剂的氧化状态过度增加，导致活性和选择性下降。中毒效应发生在原料中杂质或抑制剂与催化剂表面结合，降低其效率。再生方法旨在恢复催化剂的原始活性和选择性。空气再氧化是常见的做法，但可能需要较高的温度，可能导致结构损伤。CO2再氧化提供了一种较为温和的选择，可能降低结构损伤的风险，同时还能再生催化剂。氧气再氧化效果良好，但需要仔细控制以防止过热和潜在的催化剂破坏。

CO2添加到反应混合物中可以帮助减轻VOx催化的反应中的过氧化作用，作为一种温和的氧化剂。这允许更精确地控制催化剂的氧化状态，保持其在脱氢过程中的活性和选择性。

2.1. Materials preparation

The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550°C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L−1 HNO3 solution at 80°C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95°C overnight.

Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis method—wet impregnation. In typical procedure, the SiBeta was contacted with an aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing from 0.8 to 15.2·103 mol L−1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and AlBeta was contacted with solution containing 3.2·103 mol L−1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O.

2.2. Materials characterization

Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by adsorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy. Before analysis, the samples were pressed at 1 ton cm−2 into thin wafers of ca. 10 mg cm−2 and placed inside the IR cell.

Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz with Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5 kHz. 

27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12 kHz. The resonance frequency of 500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al, respectively.

This document discusses the development of active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH). The study focuses on chromium-containing Beta zeolites as catalysts for CO2-PDH. The text explains that among various catalysts, chromium oxide-based materials are considered promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves the participation of Cr(II) or Cr(III) species, and redox cycles between the oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites play a crucial role. High dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are identified as essential factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. The study shows that dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by a simple impregnation procedure results in excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.
