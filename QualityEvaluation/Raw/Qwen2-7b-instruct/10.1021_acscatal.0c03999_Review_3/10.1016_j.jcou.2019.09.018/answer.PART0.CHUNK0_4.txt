[1] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[2] "Moreover, due to large scale propene production the process can be attractive way for chemical CO2 utilisation, because in addition to propene, hydrogen and carbon monoxide (syngas) are produced as the main products."
[3] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[4] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."
[5] "Over γ-Al2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 addition exerts poisoning effect."

This document discusses the development of active and selective catalysts for propane to propene dehydrogenation in assistance of CO2 (CO2-PDH). The study focuses on chromium-containing Beta zeolites as catalysts for CO2-PDH. The text explains that among various catalysts, chromium oxide-based materials are considered promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves the participation of Cr(II) or Cr(III) species, and redox cycles between the oxidized/reduced forms of Cr sites play a crucial role. High dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are identified as essential factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. The study shows that dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion by a simple impregnation procedure results in excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.
