[1] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[2] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."
[3] "Moreover, in switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2 the formation rate of propene raises in mode with CO2 only over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalyst,while over Cr-containing AlBeta catalyst a negative effect on the rate of propene formation was observed."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation and poisoning effects. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Reoxidation with air is generally more effective but requires higher temperatures compared to reoxidation with CO2 or O2. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by acting as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. The dealumination process has a significant impact on the catalytic properties of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts, leading to improved performance. The low acidity of SiBeta supports high selectivity to propene, whereas the high acidity of AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons. In the switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene is higher over Cr-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts when CO2 is present, while a negative effect on propene formation rate is observed over Cr-containing AlBeta catalysts.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因包括过氧化和毒化效应。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的重新氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响有所不同。与空气重新氧化相比，空气重新氧化通常更有效，但需要更高的温度。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过作为氧化脱氢途径中的温和氧化剂。去铝化过程对Cr含量为2 wt %的Beta沸石催化剂的催化性质有显著影响，导致性能改善。低酸性的SiBeta有利于丙烯的高选择性，而高酸性的AlBeta则促进丙烷裂解为轻质烃类。在丙烷脱氢操作模式的切换中，在CO2存在与否的情况下，仅当CO2存在时，Cr含量为SiBeta沸石催化剂的丙烯形成速率更高，而在Cr含量为AlBeta催化剂上观察到丙烯形成速率的负效应。
