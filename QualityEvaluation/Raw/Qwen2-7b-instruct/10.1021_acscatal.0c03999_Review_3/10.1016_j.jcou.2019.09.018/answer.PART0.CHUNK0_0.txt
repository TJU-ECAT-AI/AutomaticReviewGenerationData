<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include poisoning effects from CO2 over γ-Al2O3 and limitations in using active carbon due to periodic regeneration with air. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. For example, reoxidation with air can lead to overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, whereas CO2 addition may mitigate overoxidation.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的失活主要原因是γ-Al2O3上的CO2中毒效应以及使用活性碳在空气周期再生时的限制。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，其有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。例如，在VOx催化反应中，空气重新氧化可能导致过氧化，而CO2添加可能有助于缓解过氧化。
