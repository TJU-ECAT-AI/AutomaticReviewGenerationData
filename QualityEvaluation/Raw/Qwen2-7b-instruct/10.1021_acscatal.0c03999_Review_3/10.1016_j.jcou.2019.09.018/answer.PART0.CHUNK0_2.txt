The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are overoxidation and poisoning effects. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have varying effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

Overoxidation refers to the excessive oxidation state of the metal oxide catalyst, leading to a decrease in activity and selectivity. Poisoning effects occur when impurities or inhibitors in the feedstock bind to the catalyst surface, reducing its efficiency. The regeneration methods aim to restore the catalyst's original activity and selectivity. Air reoxidation is common but may lead to high temperatures, potentially causing structural damage. CO2 reoxidation offers a milder alternative, potentially reducing the risk of structural damage while still regenerating the catalyst. Oxygen reoxidation is effective but requires careful control to prevent overheating and potential catalyst destruction.

CO2 addition to the reaction mixture can help mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by acting as a mild oxidant. This allows for more controlled oxidation states of the catalyst, preserving its activity and selectivity during the dehydrogenation process.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化和中毒效应。针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，再生方法如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化在有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面有所不同。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化的反应中的过氧化作用。

过氧化是指催化剂的氧化状态过度增加，导致活性和选择性下降。中毒效应发生在原料中杂质或抑制剂与催化剂表面结合，降低其效率。再生方法旨在恢复催化剂的原始活性和选择性。空气再氧化是常见的做法，但可能需要较高的温度，可能导致结构损伤。CO2再氧化提供了一种较为温和的选择，可能降低结构损伤的风险，同时还能再生催化剂。氧气再氧化效果良好，但需要仔细控制以防止过热和潜在的催化剂破坏。

CO2添加到反应混合物中可以帮助减轻VOx催化的反应中的过氧化作用，作为一种温和的氧化剂。这允许更精确地控制催化剂的氧化状态，保持其在脱氢过程中的活性和选择性。
