2.1. Materials preparation

The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550°C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L−1 HNO3 solution at 80°C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95°C overnight.

Chromium-containing SiBeta catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis method—wet impregnation. In typical procedure, the SiBeta was contacted with an aqueous chromium nitrate solutions containing from 0.8 to 15.2·103 mol L−1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and AlBeta was contacted with solution containing 3.2·103 mol L−1 Cr(NO3)3·9H2O.

2.2. Materials characterization

Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by adsorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy. Before analysis, the samples were pressed at 1 ton cm−2 into thin wafers of ca. 10 mg cm−2 and placed inside the IR cell.

Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz with Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5 kHz. 

27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12 kHz. The resonance frequency of 500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al, respectively.

This study focused on preparing chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The catalysts were synthesized by removing aluminum from the TEABeta zeolite precursor, resulting in a silica support with a high Si/Al ratio, followed by wet impregnation of chromium nitrate solutions. The acidic properties of the catalysts were characterized using pyridine adsorption and infrared spectroscopy, and their structure was analyzed using 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy.
