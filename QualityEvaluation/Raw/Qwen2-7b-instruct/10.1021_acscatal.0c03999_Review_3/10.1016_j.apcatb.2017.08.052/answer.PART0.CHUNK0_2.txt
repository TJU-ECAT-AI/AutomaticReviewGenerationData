[1] "The main causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include poisoning due to adsorption of sulfur compounds, carbon deposition, sintering, and surface oxide formation."
[2] "Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have been studied. Air reoxidation is effective but requires higher temperatures than CO2 or O2 reoxidation. CO2 reoxidation shows promise in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, offering a more controlled regeneration process."
[3] "The effectiveness of different regeneration methods depends on factors such as the type of catalyst, the extent of deactivation, and the specific reaction conditions. CO2 addition can potentially reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions while maintaining or enhancing catalytic performance."

Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by poisoning from sulfur compounds adsorption, carbon deposition, sintering, and surface oxide formation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been explored. Air reoxidation requires higher temperatures compared to CO2 or O2 reoxidation. CO2 reoxidation offers a more controlled regeneration process, which can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these methods varies based on the catalyst type, deactivation level, and reaction conditions. CO2 addition may reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions while preserving or improving catalytic performance.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因，特别是对于Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括由于吸附硫化合物引起的中毒、碳沉积、烧结和表面氧化物形成。已研究了各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化。空气再氧化需要更高的温度，而CO2或O2再氧化则更低。CO2再氧化提供了一种更可控的再生过程，可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。这些方法的有效性取决于催化剂类型、失活程度和反应条件等因素。通过添加CO2，可能可以减少VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，并保持或提高催化性能。
