[1] "The main cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is typically attributed to the formation of metal oxides, particularly in Cr-based and VOx catalysts."
[2] "Various regeneration methods have been explored, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, each with its own effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance."
[3] "The addition of CO2 has shown potential in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are the formation of metal oxides. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have different levels of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. CO2 addition has shown potential to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
