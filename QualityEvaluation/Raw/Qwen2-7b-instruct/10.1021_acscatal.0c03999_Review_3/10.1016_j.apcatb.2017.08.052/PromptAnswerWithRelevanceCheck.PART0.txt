What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

<quotes>
[1] "The main cause of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts is the formation of chromium oxides due to high reaction temperatures."
[2] "VOx catalysts suffer from overoxidation, which leads to the formation of vanadium pentoxide."
[3] "Regeneration of Cr-based catalysts typically involves reoxidation with air or oxygen at high temperatures."
[4] "For VOx catalysts, reoxidation with air or oxygen is effective in restoring activity, but it can lead to overoxidation."
[5] "Using CO2 for reoxidation has been proposed as a method to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."
[6] "Temperature requirements for effective regeneration vary depending on the type of catalyst and the extent of deactivation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation, particularly in Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by the formation of chromium oxides due to high reaction temperatures in Cr-based catalysts and overoxidation leading to the formation of vanadium pentoxide in VOx catalysts. 

2. Various regeneration methods for Cr-based catalysts involve reoxidation with air or oxygen at high temperatures. For VOx catalysts, reoxidation with air or oxygen is effective but may lead to overoxidation. Using CO2 for reoxidation is suggested as a means to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

3. Temperature requirements for effective regeneration depend on the specific catalyst and the degree of deactivation.

1. Cr催化剂失活的主要原因是由于高温反应导致铬氧化物的形成。而VOx催化剂的失活主要由过氧化引起，导致五氧化二钒的形成。

2. Cr基催化剂的再生通常通过在高温下用空气或氧气重新氧化来实现。对于VOx催化剂，用空气或氧气进行重新氧化是有效的，但可能会导致过氧化。使用CO2进行重新氧化被提议作为减少VOx催化反应中过氧化的方法。

3. 有效再生所需的温度要求取决于特定催化剂和失活的程度。

[1] "The main causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include poisoning due to adsorption of sulfur compounds, carbon deposition, sintering, and surface oxide formation."
[2] "Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have been studied. Air reoxidation is effective but requires higher temperatures than CO2 or O2 reoxidation. CO2 reoxidation shows promise in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, offering a more controlled regeneration process."
[3] "The effectiveness of different regeneration methods depends on factors such as the type of catalyst, the extent of deactivation, and the specific reaction conditions. CO2 addition can potentially reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions while maintaining or enhancing catalytic performance."

Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by poisoning from sulfur compounds adsorption, carbon deposition, sintering, and surface oxide formation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been explored. Air reoxidation requires higher temperatures compared to CO2 or O2 reoxidation. CO2 reoxidation offers a more controlled regeneration process, which can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these methods varies based on the catalyst type, deactivation level, and reaction conditions. CO2 addition may reduce overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions while preserving or improving catalytic performance.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因，特别是对于Cr基和VOx催化剂，包括由于吸附硫化合物引起的中毒、碳沉积、烧结和表面氧化物形成。已研究了各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化。空气再氧化需要更高的温度，而CO2或O2再氧化则更低。CO2再氧化提供了一种更可控的再生过程，可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。这些方法的有效性取决于催化剂类型、失活程度和反应条件等因素。通过添加CO2，可能可以减少VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，并保持或提高催化性能。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Chromium-based catalysts can be effectively reactivated with air, although this process might require more energy. Vanadium oxides, however, benefit from reoxidation with either carbon dioxide (CO2) or oxygen (O2), which can help mitigate overoxidation. Additionally, incorporating CO2 into the reoxidation process can contribute to preserving the catalytic activity of the vanadium oxide catalyst.
