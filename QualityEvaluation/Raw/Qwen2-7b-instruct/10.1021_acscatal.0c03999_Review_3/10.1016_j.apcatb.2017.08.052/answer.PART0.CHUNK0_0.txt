1. Metal oxide catalyst deactivation, particularly in Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is primarily caused by the formation of chromium oxides due to high reaction temperatures in Cr-based catalysts and overoxidation leading to the formation of vanadium pentoxide in VOx catalysts. 

2. Various regeneration methods for Cr-based catalysts involve reoxidation with air or oxygen at high temperatures. For VOx catalysts, reoxidation with air or oxygen is effective but may lead to overoxidation. Using CO2 for reoxidation is suggested as a means to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

3. Temperature requirements for effective regeneration depend on the specific catalyst and the degree of deactivation.

1. Cr催化剂失活的主要原因是由于高温反应导致铬氧化物的形成。而VOx催化剂的失活主要由过氧化引起，导致五氧化二钒的形成。

2. Cr基催化剂的再生通常通过在高温下用空气或氧气重新氧化来实现。对于VOx催化剂，用空气或氧气进行重新氧化是有效的，但可能会导致过氧化。使用CO2进行重新氧化被提议作为减少VOx催化反应中过氧化的方法。

3. 有效再生所需的温度要求取决于特定催化剂和失活的程度。
