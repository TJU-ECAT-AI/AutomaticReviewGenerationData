The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are the formation of chromium oxides and chromium carbides in Cr-based catalysts, and the formation of vanadium pentoxide and vanadium trioxide in VOx catalysts. Among various regeneration methods, reoxidation with air is generally less effective than with oxygen because of the risk of overoxidation. However, the use of CO2 during regeneration is beneficial in reducing overoxidation and maintaining catalytic performance. The addition of CO2 can mitigate the risk of overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是Cr基催化剂中形成铬氧化物和铬碳化物，而VOx催化剂的失效通常归因于五氧化二钒和三氧化二钒的形成。在各种再生方法中，空气氧化通常不如氧气氧化有效，因为存在过氧化的风险。然而，在再生过程中使用CO2是有益的，有助于减少过氧化并保持催化性能。在VOx催化反应中加入CO2可以减轻过氧化的风险。
