<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Chromium-based catalysts can be effectively reactivated with air, although this process might require more energy. Vanadium oxides, however, benefit from reoxidation with either carbon dioxide (CO2) or oxygen (O2), which can help mitigate overoxidation. Additionally, incorporating CO2 into the reoxidation process can contribute to preserving the catalytic activity of the vanadium oxide catalyst.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括烧结、中毒和过氧化。特别是，基于铬的催化剂可以通过空气重新氧化有效再生，尽管这个过程可能需要更高的能量消耗。而对于范德华氧化物，通过二氧化碳（CO2）或氧气（O2）进行重新氧化可以减轻过氧化。此外，将CO2引入重新氧化过程有助于保持范德华氧化物催化剂的活性。
