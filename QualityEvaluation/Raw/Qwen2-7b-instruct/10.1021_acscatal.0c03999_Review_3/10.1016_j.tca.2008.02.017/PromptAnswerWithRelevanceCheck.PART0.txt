[1] "The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method."
[2] "The TG analysis performed for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in the catalytic runs in the CO2 and He atmosphere shows a significant decrease in the detected total mass loss."
[3] "An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C."
[5] "An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process."

1. The main causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are the removal of carbonyl/carboxyl groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface. 
2. In the catalytic runs performed in the presence of carbon dioxide, the total mass loss detected for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst was significantly lower compared to the inert atmosphere, indicating that CO2 partly protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation.
3. The drop in catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both the removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface.
4. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst, when used in the reaction, begins to be gasified starting from 310°C.
5. The increase in total mass loss observed for the used catalysts compared to the fresh sample indicates that a carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因是表面羰基/羧基基团的去除以及催化剂表面上不活性焦炭的形成。
2. 在二氧化碳存在的催化运行中，检测到Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在二氧化碳气氛下的总质量损失显著低于惰性气氛，这表明二氧化碳部分防止了活性碳基催化剂的失活。
3. 随着时间的增加观察到的催化剂活性下降可归因于表面羰基/羧基基团的去除以及催化剂表面不活性焦炭的形成。
4. 当Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂用于反应时，其开始在310°C左右被气化。
5. 对比新鲜样品，使用过的催化剂出现的总质量损失增加表明在脱氢过程中形成了碳质沉积物。

[1] "The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method."
[2] "An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower temperatures."
[3] "It should be stressed that CO2 is much less effective oxidizing agent compared to air."
[4] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C."
[5] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface and the gradual decrease in the concentration of active carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 show different effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. CO2 addition is found to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

2. Chromium oxide (CrOx) present in the samples acts as a catalytically active phase in carbon gasification, causing the catalyst to begin to be burned at temperatures as low as 300 C.

3. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is less effective as an oxidizing agent compared to air. 

4. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction undergoes gasification starting from 310 C.

5. The temperature used in the catalytic experiments was insufficient for the reaction between carbon dioxide in the reactant feed and the active carbon support, as evidenced by TG measurements in the CO2 atmosphere.

1. 催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面生成不可活性焦炭以及活性羰基和羧基表面物种浓度的逐渐降低。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的氧化，表现出不同的效果、温度需求和对催化性能的影响。CO2添加被发现可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。

2. 磷酸铬（CrOx）在样品中作为碳气化的催化活性相，导致催化剂在300°C左右开始燃烧。

3. 二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂的有效性低于空气。

4. 在反应中使用的Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂从310°C开始发生气化。

5. 所使用的催化实验温度不足以使碳二氧在反应物流中的碳支持之间进行反应，这从在CO2气氛下的TG测量中得到证实。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of crystalline phases like Cr2O3, a partial blocking of micropores, and a decrease in the catalytic activity. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions under certain conditions. The temperature used in catalytic experiments might not be sufficient for the reaction between carbon dioxide and the active carbon support, as evidenced by TG measurements.

[1] "It was found that the catalytic runs resulted in a partial decomposition of surface O-containing groups, which together with CrOx species play a role of active centers."
[2] "Moreover, a formation of inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface was observed."
[3] "It should, however, be noted that an additional mass loss at about 920 C is observed for Cr(5.0)/AC. This effect can be assigned to reduction of Cr(III) to metallic chromium by carbonaceous support."
[4] "An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower temperatures."
[5] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are the partial decomposition of surface O-containing groups, formation of inactive carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, reduction of Cr(III) to metallic chromium, and a shift of the oxidation process towards lower temperatures due to the presence of chromium on the active carbon surface. The formation of a carbonaceous deposit during the dehydrogenation process also contributes to catalyst deactivation. CO2 addition has a minimal effect on mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, as evidenced by the TG measurements indicating that the reaction between carbon dioxide and the active carbon support was not effective under the conditions used in the catalytic experiments.

氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因包括表面含氧团的分解、催化剂表面上形成不活性碳沉积物、Cr(III)还原为金属铬以及在活性碳表面存在铬导致氧化过程向较低温度偏移。活性碳表面形成的碳沉积物也加速了催化剂的失活。对于VOx催化反应，通过TG测量发现，CO2添加对缓解过氧化作用的影响较小，因为在催化实验中使用的温度不足以使二氧化碳与活性碳支持之间的反应有效。
