[1] "The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method."
[2] "On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface."
[3] "It was found that CO2 can be involved in the propane transformation via two independent reaction paths."
[4] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac- tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample."
[5] "The rate of activity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane,ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6."
[6] "It should be stressed that the presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."
[7] "The decomposition of the AC sample undergoes in two stages. At lower temperatures (<150 C), the removal of chemisorbed water from the surface is observed."
[8] "An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process."
[9] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface and the gradual decrease in the concentration of surface carbonyl- and carboxyl-like species. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, providing a protective effect against deactivation. The temperature used in catalytic experiments may not be sufficient for the reaction between carbon dioxide in the feed and the active carbon support, as evidenced by the TG measurements.

氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因包括催化剂表面形成无活性焦炭和表面羰基-和羧基类似物浓度逐渐降低。不同再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，在有效性和温度需求方面存在差异，并对催化性能产生影响。CO2添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化，提供对抗失活的保护作用。催化实验中使用的温度可能不足以在反应物流中二氧化碳与活性碳支持之间发生反应，这从TG测量中得到证据。
