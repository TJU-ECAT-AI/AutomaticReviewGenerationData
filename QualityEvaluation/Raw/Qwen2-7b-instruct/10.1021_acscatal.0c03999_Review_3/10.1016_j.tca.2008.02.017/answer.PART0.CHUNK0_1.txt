[1] "The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method."
[2] "An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower temperatures."
[3] "It should be stressed that CO2 is much less effective oxidizing agent compared to air."
[4] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C."
[5] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes include the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface and the gradual decrease in the concentration of active carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 show different effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance. CO2 addition is found to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

2. Chromium oxide (CrOx) present in the samples acts as a catalytically active phase in carbon gasification, causing the catalyst to begin to be burned at temperatures as low as 300 C.

3. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is less effective as an oxidizing agent compared to air. 

4. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction undergoes gasification starting from 310 C.

5. The temperature used in the catalytic experiments was insufficient for the reaction between carbon dioxide in the reactant feed and the active carbon support, as evidenced by TG measurements in the CO2 atmosphere.

1. 催化剂失活的主要原因是催化剂表面生成不可活性焦炭以及活性羰基和羧基表面物种浓度的逐渐降低。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的氧化，表现出不同的效果、温度需求和对催化性能的影响。CO2添加被发现可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。

2. 磷酸铬（CrOx）在样品中作为碳气化的催化活性相，导致催化剂在300°C左右开始燃烧。

3. 二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂的有效性低于空气。

4. 在反应中使用的Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂从310°C开始发生气化。

5. 所使用的催化实验温度不足以使碳二氧在反应物流中的碳支持之间进行反应，这从在CO2气氛下的TG测量中得到证实。
