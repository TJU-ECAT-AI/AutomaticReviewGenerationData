[1] "An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide."
[2] "It should be assumed that chromium oxide species are deposited mainly on an external surface of the active carbon support."
[3] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac- tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample."
[4] "On the other hand, the specific surface area determined formally using the BET or Langmuir equation decreases with raising the Cr loading."
[5] "An introduction of chromium oxide results in lower total mass loss (86.89%) than for the AC material."
[6] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include the formation of crystalline phases like Cr2O3, a partial blocking of micropores, and a decrease in the catalytic activity. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions under certain conditions. The temperature used in catalytic experiments might not be sufficient for the reaction between carbon dioxide and the active carbon support, as evidenced by TG measurements.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因包括形成结晶相如Cr2O3、微孔部分堵塞以及催化活性下降。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，在有效性和温度要求方面存在差异，并对催化性能产生影响。CO2的添加可以在某些条件下缓解VOx催化的反应中的过氧化。催化实验所使用的温度可能不足以使反应物流中含有的二氧化碳与活性碳支持物反应，这一点通过热重测量得到了证实。
