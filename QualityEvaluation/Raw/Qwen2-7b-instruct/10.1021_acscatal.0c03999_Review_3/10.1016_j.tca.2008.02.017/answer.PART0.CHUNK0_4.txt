[1] "It was found that the catalytic runs resulted in a partial decomposition of surface O-containing groups, which together with CrOx species play a role of active centers."
[2] "Moreover, a formation of inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface was observed."
[3] "It should, however, be noted that an additional mass loss at about 920 C is observed for Cr(5.0)/AC. This effect can be assigned to reduction of Cr(III) to metallic chromium by carbonaceous support."
[4] "An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower temperatures."
[5] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C."
[6] "The presence of the introduced chromium oxide results in lower total mass loss (86.89%) than for the AC material."
[7] "An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process."
[8] "The TG measurements performed in the CO2 atmosphere evidence that temperature used in the catalytic experiments was too low for the reaction between carbon dioxide present in the reactant feed and the active carbon support."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are the partial decomposition of surface O-containing groups, formation of inactive carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface, reduction of Cr(III) to metallic chromium, and a shift of the oxidation process towards lower temperatures due to the presence of chromium on the active carbon surface. The formation of a carbonaceous deposit during the dehydrogenation process also contributes to catalyst deactivation. CO2 addition has a minimal effect on mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, as evidenced by the TG measurements indicating that the reaction between carbon dioxide and the active carbon support was not effective under the conditions used in the catalytic experiments.

氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因包括表面含氧团的分解、催化剂表面上形成不活性碳沉积物、Cr(III)还原为金属铬以及在活性碳表面存在铬导致氧化过程向较低温度偏移。活性碳表面形成的碳沉积物也加速了催化剂的失活。对于VOx催化反应，通过TG测量发现，CO2添加对缓解过氧化作用的影响较小，因为在催化实验中使用的温度不足以使二氧化碳与活性碳支持之间的反应有效。
