[1] "The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method."
[2] "The TG analysis performed for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in the catalytic runs in the CO2 and He atmosphere shows a significant decrease in the detected total mass loss."
[3] "An increase in the total mass loss observed for the used catalysts in comparison to the fresh sample suggests that the carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C."

1. The main causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are the removal of carbonyl/carboxyl groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface. 
2. In the catalytic runs performed in the presence of carbon dioxide, the total mass loss detected for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst was significantly lower compared to the inert atmosphere, indicating that CO2 partly protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation.
3. The drop in catalytic activity observed with time-on-stream can be attributed to both the removal of carbonyl/carboxylic groups and the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface.
4. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst, when used in the reaction, begins to be gasified starting from 310°C.
5. The increase in total mass loss observed for the used catalysts compared to the fresh sample indicates that a carbonaceous deposit was formed during the dehydrogenation process.

1. 在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因是表面羰基/羧基基团的去除以及催化剂表面上不活性焦炭的形成。
2. 在二氧化碳存在的催化运行中，检测到Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在二氧化碳气氛下的总质量损失显著低于惰性气氛，这表明二氧化碳部分防止了活性碳基催化剂的失活。
3. 随着时间的增加观察到的催化剂活性下降可归因于表面羰基/羧基基团的去除以及催化剂表面不活性焦炭的形成。
4. 当Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂用于反应时，其开始在310°C左右被气化。
5. 对比新鲜样品，使用过的催化剂出现的总质量损失增加表明在脱氢过程中形成了碳质沉积物。
