<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are sintering, poisoning, and overoxidation. Among the regeneration methods, reoxidation with air is more effective than reoxidation with CO2 or O2 in regenerating catalyst activity. The temperature requirement for reoxidation with air ranges from 400 to 500°C, which is lower compared to reoxidation with O2, requiring around 600°C. Additionally, the addition of CO2 during reoxidation can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括烧结、中毒和过氧化。在再生方法中，使用空气进行再氧化比使用CO2或O2更有效，能够恢复催化剂活性。空气再氧化的温度要求在400至500°C之间，相比之下，使用O2进行再氧化需要大约600°C的温度。此外，在再氧化过程中添加CO2可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用。
