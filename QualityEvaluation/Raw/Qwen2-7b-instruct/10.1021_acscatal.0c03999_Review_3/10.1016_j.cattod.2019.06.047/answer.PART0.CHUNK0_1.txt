1. Overoxidation is the primary cause of deactivation in metal oxide catalysts, specifically focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
2. Regeneration methods for these catalysts vary in effectiveness, with differences in temperature requirements for reoxidation through air, CO2, or O2.
3. CO2 addition is noted as a method to potentially alleviate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
