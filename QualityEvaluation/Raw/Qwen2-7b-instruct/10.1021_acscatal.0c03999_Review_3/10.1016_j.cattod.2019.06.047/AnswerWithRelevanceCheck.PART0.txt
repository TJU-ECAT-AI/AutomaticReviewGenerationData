      <English>
          The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, especially for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve poisoning, sintering, and overoxidation. Different regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, were evaluated based on their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and influence on catalytic performance. CO2 addition shows promise in reducing overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
