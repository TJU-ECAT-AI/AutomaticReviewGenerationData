<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly for Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve poisoning, sintering, and overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, were evaluated for their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and influence on catalytic performance. CO2 addition showed promise in reducing overoxidation during VOx-catalyzed reactions.
