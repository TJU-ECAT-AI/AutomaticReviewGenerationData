The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, were compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Among these, reoxidation with air was found to be the most effective method in regenerating the catalysts. Temperature requirements varied among the different regeneration methods, and the impact on catalytic performance was observed to differ based on the regeneration method used.
