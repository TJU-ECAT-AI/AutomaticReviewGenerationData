[1] "The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are poisoning due to adsorption of sulfur compounds and coking due to the formation of coke from hydrocarbons."
[2] "Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 have been compared in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance."
[3] "CO2 addition has been found to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are poisoning due to sulfur compound adsorption and coking caused by hydrocarbon formation. Different regeneration methods, including reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, have been evaluated based on their effectiveness, temperature needs, and impact on catalytic efficiency. CO2 addition is effective in reducing overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是由硫化合物吸附引起的中毒和由烃类形成导致的结焦。不同的再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，根据其有效性、温度需求以及对催化性能的影响进行了比较。CO2添加在VOx催化反应中有效地减少了过氧化。
