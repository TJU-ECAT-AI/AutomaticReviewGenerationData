Vapour-phase Oxidation of Diamond Surfaces in 0, studied by Diffuse Reflectance Fourier-transform Infrared and Temperature-prog rammed Desorption Spectroscopy Toshihiro Ando,* Kazuo Yamamoto, Motohiko Ishii, Mutsukazu Kamo and Yoichiro Sat0 National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba,lbaraki 305, Japan Thermal oxidizing treatments o f hydrogenated diamond surfaces have been performed in an O2 environment.
Chemisorption of oxygen on diamond surfaces has been investigated by diffuse reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD),temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) and ther- mogravimetry (TG). Oxidation of the hydrogenated diamond occurred above 300 "C and diamond started to burn out above 480 "C in 20% 0,. Diffuse reflectance FTIR spectra indicated that the oxidation gave species contain- ing C-0 and C-0-C structures on the diamond surface above 300C. The structures o f the chemisorbed species changed with the oxidation temperature. The maximum coverage o f oxygen was obtained between 480 and 500 "C. TPD spectra o f oxidized diamond indicated that the oxygencontaining species were desorbed as CO and CO, above 480C. This paper deals with the mechanistic considerations for the oxidation o f diamond sur- faces.
Chemisorption on a variety of carbon compounds such as graphite, carbon black, carbon fibres, and coal has been extensively studied by an array of different spectroscopic techniques.'-'* Although diamond is one of the most impor- tant and interesting forms of carbonaceous materials, few studies have been reported on the oxidation of diamond sur- faces. The characterization of chemisorbed species on diamond surfaces is of great interest because of its role in the stabilization of diamond surface structures and its giving vital information for the understanding of chemical vapour depo- sition processes. It is also necessary to understand the properties of the diamond surface and metal/diamond inter- face in applications of semiconducting diamond". " because the electronic character is affected by the properties of the metal/semiconducting diamond interface.
A number of experimental and theoretical studies of diamond surfaces have been carried o  t . '  - ' Significant amounts of oxygen are present on both natural surfaces and those polished in an aqueous medium." It has been also reported that diamond growth is significantly affected by the presence of a small amount of oxygen during chemical vapour deposition.18-21 However, no detailed information on the reactivity of diamond surfaces towards oxidation have been reported.
Recently Evans has reviewed functional groups at diamond We have also reported that carbonyl (C-0),lactone [-(C0)O-1,carboxylic acid (CO'H) and cyclic ether (COC) groups were observed on diamond surfaces by FTIR spectrocopy.IR absorption spectroscopy is one of the most useful methods for studies of the species chemi- sorbed on solid  surface.'-*' Moreover, diamond is opti- cally transparent in the IR region except for the frequency range where weak two-phonon absorption bands appearsz4 in contrast with other 'black' carbons.In this study, the oxidation of hydrogenated diamond sur- faces has been performed in 0 ' environments. The reacti- vities and the mechanisms of the vapour-phase oxidation have been investigated.Experimental Commercially available synthesized and natural diamond powder was used. Its specific surface area was 20.3 m2 g-',determined with nitrogen at 77 K using a Micrometrics Digi- sorb 2600 surface analyser. Before oxidation treatment, the diamond powder was fully hydrogenated in a pure hydrogen (99.9999%) environment at 900 0C.26 The oxidation of this hydrogenated diamond was performed in a tubular flow reactor. The reaction was carried out using O2 (20%) in Ar for a range of times at treatment temperatures from 300 to
1000C. The temperature of the substrates was measured by
a thermocouple detector. Diffuse reflectance IR spectra were recorded on an FTIR instrument (Bio-Rad, Digilab FTS-45) equipped with a cooled MCT detector in the region 4000- 400 cm-' at a resolution of 2 cm-'. 256 scans were accumu- lated for each spectrum. A KBr standard powder was used for the reference spectrum. Diffuse reflectance was converted into Kubelka-Munk function unit.Thermal desorption spectra were obtained at atmospheric pressure using He (99.99%) as a carrier gas using a quadru- pole mass spectrometer combined with a thermobalance. A sampling valve interfaced the atmospheric-pressure gas to the ultra-high-vacuum system, which contained the mass spec- trometer and was pumped by a turbomolecular pump. Two computers allowed simultaneous observation of multiple masses and the thermocouple signal. TPD was carried out from room temperature to 1000C at a heating rate of 20C min-'. TPR was carried out in an O2 (1.0%)-He flow from room temperature to 1000C at a heating rate of 20C min-'.A double monochromator (SPEX model 1403) equipped with a photomultiplier was used for laser Raman spectroscopic measurements. The excitation beam was the
514.5 nm line of an argon-ion laser. The incident laser power
was ca. 50 mW. The Raman spectra were obtained in the back-scattering geometry.

min. There was no spectral change for temperatures below
310C. After oxidation above 310"C, the bands of C-H
stretching vibrations decreased in intensity with increasing oxidation temperature. No significant C-H stretching vibra- tions remained for oxidation above 410 "C. This indicates that elimination of hydrogen by O2 was complete at around
410C. No peak due to aromatic C-H stretching vibrations
of sp2 hybridized bonding was observed in the region 3000- 3200 cm- ' during all oxidation experiments. Oxidation did not induce formation of aromatics on the diamond surface under the present conditions. Laser Raman spectra of the treated diamond showed no significant peak in the region 1500-1600 cm-'. This also indicates that no graphitic or non-diamond phase was produced on the diamond surface.
C-0-C
and C-0 Stretching Vibrutions New bands centred at 1106, 1264, 1444, 1718 and 1766 cm-' were observed above 330C [Fig. 2(c)]. The bands centred at 1106 and 1264 cm-' were assigned to C-0-C stretching vibrations ( v  -  ) of cyclic ether or cyclic ester. The doublet band at 1650-1850 cm-' was assigned to C-0 stretching vibrations ( v  =  ) of a cyclic ketone, lactone or carboxylic anhydride structure. Two maxima at 1710 and 1770 cm-' appeared at the oxidation temperature of 330C. The two maxima associated with C-O stretching vibrations increased in intensity and shifted to a higher-wavenumber region with increasing treatment temperature. The lower-wavenumber peak was more intense than the higher-wavenumber peak below 410C (Fig. 2), but the higher-wavenumber peak was dominant at high temperature (Fig. 3). The maximum was shifted to 1820 cm-' at the treatment temperature of 480C.The peak shift returned to 1806cm-' at 500C. This suggests that oxygenation was complete at 480 "C and decomposition of oxygen chemisorbed structures occurred above 480 "C.
Surface oxidation at 480C gave a 0.7% increase in weight.
In the case of the diamond crystal surface, the population of carbon atoms is 30.2 x mol m-2 on the (111) surface and 26.1 x mol m-2 on the (100) surface). As the diamond powder used in this study had a surface area of CU. 1 .o 0 . 8

3637 desorption may occur at high temperatures, the ideal calcu- lated weight gain was not obtained. However, this result sug- gests that almost all carbon atoms of the diamond surfaces were covered with oxygen atoms at a 77-88% coverage by oxidation in 20% 0, at 480C.
We now consider the C=O stretching vibration bands: Cyclic ketone structures correspond to relatively low fre- quencies (1700-1800 cm- '), carboxylic anhydride structures correspond to relatively high frequencies ( > 1800 cm- ') and lactone structures give bands between those of the cyclic ketone and carboxylic anhydride structures in this region.The spectral change of the C=O stretching vibrations sug- gests that cyclic ketone (-CO-) structures formed at a rela- tively lower temperature and changed to lactone
[-(C0)O-]
structures and furthermore to carboxylic anhy- dride [CO(O)CO] structures with increasing oxidation tem- perature (Fig. 3).The band in the region 1360-1500 cm-', which had a maximum at 1444 cm-', also grew with increasing oxidation temperature. The correct assignment of this band at 1444 cm-' is still open to debate, although we suppose that it is due to oxygen-containing species. Meldrum and Rochester reported the study of the surface oxidation of activated carbon., Their spectra show bands at CQ. 1434 cm-' in the spectrum of carbon positioned similarly to those in this study. They reported that the band at ca. 1434 cm-' was ascribed to aromatic C- H vibrations. Zawadzki also report- ed that the band at 1400-1475 cm-' was attributed to the aromatic ring absorption in the studies of various carbon- aceous materials.' However, in the present study, the exis- tence of the aromatic groups would be improbable since there was no corresponding C-H peak in the 3000-3200 cm- ' region. The laser Raman spectra likewise indicated the absence of aromatic ring mentioned above. Zawadzki indi- cated that another plausible assignment of the band in the 1400-1475 cm-' region could be to ionic carbonate struc- tures.' Fig. 4 shows the changes of the integrated peak intensities of the C-H stretching vibrations and the C-0 stretching vibrations. The total of these C-H peak intensities was reduced by raising the oxidation temperature and reached near zero at 400C. It is obvious that the elimination of hydrogen occurred in the range 310-380C. The amount of C-0 peak intensities, integrated from 1630 to 1880 cm-',gradually increased with increasing oxidation temperature up to 480C. The increase in formation of the C-0 containing group was enhanced above 400C. While both dehydroge- 50 3 40 r 2 7  30

480C. The maximum chemisorption of oxygen onto the
diamond surface was obtained in the oxidation between 480 and 500C.
Hydrolysis of the Oxidized Diamond Surface Oxidized diamond at 500C in 20% 0, was treated in 0.1 mol dm-3 NaOH at 90C for 60 min to confirm the presence of the carboxylic anhydride structures. After treatment in the NaOH solution, the sample was thoroughly washed with dis- tilled water. The peak at 1806 cm-' was shifted to 1775 cm-' and a new peak appeared at 1640 cm-' in the C-0 stretching region [Fig. 5(b)].The new peak at 1640 cm-' is ascribed to the C-0 stretching vibration and/or the 0-H bending vibration (6, -
H
)
of carboxylic acid structures. Simul- taneously, a new peak appeared at 3710 cm-' in the 0 - H stretching region ( v , -  )  [Fig. 5(b)].This spectral change indi- cated that the carboxylic acid (C0,H) structure was produc- ed. In addition, the band at 1288 cm-' in the C-0-C stretching region was reduced in intensity. The reduction of the bands at 1806 and 1288 cm-' indicated that the concen- tration of the carboxylic anhydride structure had decreased.Two bands at around 1444 and 1073 cm-' scarcely changed.

This indicates that the carboxylic anhydride structure on the oxidized diamond was hydrolysed to form the carboxylic acid structure.
Thermal Decomposition of the Oxidized Diamond Surface Diamond oxidized at 500C was treated in an Ar (99.999%) environment above 500C (Fig. 6). While the bands at 1444 and 1288 cm- ' reduced in intensity at the same temperature in the absence of 0, [Fig. qb)], the bands at 1806 and 1073 cm-' hardly changed. Species, which gave the bands at 1444 and 1288 cm-', were desorbed at a relatively low tem- perature. This result may suggest that the band at 1444 cm-' was due to the carbonate structure.The band due to C-0 stretching vibrations also reduced in intensity and the peak shifted to lower wavenumbers with increasing treatment temperature. At 700"C, the peak posi- tion was shifted to 1750 cm-' [Fig. 6(f)]. No significant IR peak was observed above 800"C, whereas the laser Raman spectra indicated a small broad peak from 1500-1600 cm-'.The carboxylic anhydride structures were decomposed first,lactone structures were decomposed successively and ketone structures remained up to 800 "C.
TPD
TPD mass spectra of diamond powder, which was oxidized at 480C in 20% 0,for 20 min, are shown in Fig. 7. TPD was carried out by raising the diamond temperature at 20C min-' in an He (200 ml min-') flow at ambient pressure, to a final temperature of 1OOO"C. Very little desorption was observed below 480 "C. Physical desorption of water occurred from room temperature to 200C. When TPD experiments were carried out immediately after oxidation, no desorption of water was detected. The main desorption pro- ducts from oxidized diamond surfaces were CO and CO,.

920C. This indicates that little desorption took place with
increasing temperature above 920 "C. No desorption of 0,was detected from room temperature to lo00 "C.
The simultaneous results of TG and DTA during TPD are also presented in Fig. 8. The TG curve shows that a small weight loss started from 480C and a steep weight loss con- tinued up to cu. 880C. This curve indicates that the major desorption is complete at ca. 900C. Close agreement between TPD and TG analysis was obtained.
The total weight loss of chemisorbed species from the diamond surface, which was oxidized at 480"C, was cu. 1.5 wt.%. As mentioned above, the oxidation gave a maximum weight gain of CQ. 0.7 wt.% in this oxidation process. Once oxygen chemisorbed onto diamond surfaces, oxygen atoms can never be desorbed as oxygen molecules (0,) and it is easy for them to be desorbed as CO and CO,. In the case of hydrogen desorption, hydrogen chemisorbed on diamond surfaces can be desorbed thermally as hydrogen molecules (H,) and it is more dificult for it to be desorbed as hydrocar- bon molecules such as CH,.26 This point seems to be impor-

The DTA curve shows a significant exothermic peak at around 580C and a small broad exothermic peak in the 380-460C region. When considered with the FTIR and TPD mass spectroscopic analyses, this result suggests that the oxygenation of diamond surface and the desorption of CO, are exothermic processes.
TPR
TPR studies were attempted for the oxidation process. TPR was carried out by raising the diamond temperature at 20C min-' in an 0,(1.0%)-He flow at ambient pressure, to a final temperature of 1OOO"C. TPR selected mass us. tem- perature plots obtained from hydrogenated diamond powder in O2 (1.0%) are presented in Fig. 9. Oxygen started to be used up at ca. 400 "C and decreased rapidly above ca. 500 "C.
A significant amount of water was observed from 400 to 680 "C. The elimination of hydrogen occurred during oxidia- tion at a relatively low temperature to produce water simul- taneously. Above 550"C, CO, and CO were desorbed significantly and diamond burned off.
The TG curve obtained during TPR showed a small weight gain from 400 to 500C and then the weight gradually reduced with increasing temperature (Fig. 10). Above 560 "C,a steep and continuous weight loss took place. The DTA curve shows two exothermic peaks in the 400-500C region and in the 550-800C region. The former peak was due to the oxygenation of the diamond surface and the latter was due to the decomposition and/or combustion of diamond.
According to the TPD analysis above, it is believed that the desorption of CO, is the main exothermic process.
Mechanism of the Oxidation of Hydrogenated Diamond Surfaces No reaction occurred below 300C in an 0, environment. In other words, the hydrogenated diamond surfaces are entirely stable in air below 300 "C. (a )

TPC
Fig. 10 TG (a) and DTA (b) curves during the TPR in Fig. 9 We propose that the oxidation of a hydrogenated diamond surface can be divided into three major stages as follows: (A) dehydrogenation (in the region 300-380 "C), (B) oxygenation (in the region 380-480 "C), (C) continuous oxidation with desorption, i.e. combustion (above 500 "C).
First the dehydrogenation proceeded via oxygen molecules and the dissociative adsorption of these on the diamond surface formed the C-0-C [Scheme l(b)] and the C-0 containing structures above 300 "C [Scheme l(c)]. Whilst hydrogen was not desorbed thermally below 800C in Ar, He and/or vacuum conditions,26 the presence of oxygen mol- ecules induced the dehydrogenation and produced water molecules above 300 "C.
Secondly, after dehydrogenation, further adsorption of oxygen continued and the oxidized surface structure changed gradually up to ca. 480C. With increasing oxygen coverage,both the ether structure [Scheme 2(b)] and the ketone struc- ture [Scheme 2(c)] changed into the lactone structure [Scheme 2(4] and further to the carboxylic anhydride struc- ture [Scheme 2(e)] in the temperature range 380-480C.
