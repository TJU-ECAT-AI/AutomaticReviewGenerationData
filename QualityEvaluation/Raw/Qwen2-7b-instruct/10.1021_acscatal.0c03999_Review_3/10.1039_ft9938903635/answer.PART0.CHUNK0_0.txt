The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is often attributed to overoxidation, particularly in catalysts such as Cr-based and VOx. Various regeneration methods aim to restore catalyst activity. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be employed. Air reoxidation generally requires higher temperatures compared to CO2 and O2 reoxidation, which are more effective in removing less stable oxygen species, thereby preserving more of the catalyst's active sites. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively removing oxygen without causing excessive degradation of the catalyst.

Answer: The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is overoxidation, affecting catalysts like Cr-based and VOx. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore activity. Air reoxidation typically necessitates higher temperatures than CO2 and O2 reoxidation, which are more effective in removing less stable oxygen species while conserving more active sites.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失效原因是过氧化，尤其是Cr基和VOx催化剂。不同的再生方法旨在恢复催化剂活性。空气、CO2或O2的再氧化可以被使用。与CO2和O2再氧化相比，空气再氧化通常需要更高的温度，而CO2和O2再氧化则更有效地去除不稳定氧物种，从而保留更多催化剂的活性位点。CO2添加有助于缓解VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过选择性地去除氧气而不造成催化剂过量降解来减轻过氧化作用。
