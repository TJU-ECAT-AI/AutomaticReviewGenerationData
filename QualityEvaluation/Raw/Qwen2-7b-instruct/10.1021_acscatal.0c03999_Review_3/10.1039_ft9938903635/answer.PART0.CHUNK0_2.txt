[1] "The oxidation of hydrogenated diamond surfaces has been performed in 20% O2 for a range of times at treatment temperatures from 300 to 1000°C."
[2] "Diffuse reflectance FTIR spectra indicated that the oxidation gave species containing C-O and C-O-C structures on the diamond surface above 300°C."
[3] "TPD spectra of oxidized diamond indicated that the oxygen-containing species were desorbed as CO and CO2 above 480°C."
[4] "The maximum coverage of oxygen was obtained between 480 and 500°C."
[5] "The authors propose that the oxidation of a hydrogenated diamond surface can be divided into three major stages: dehydrogenation (in the region 300-380°C), oxygenation (in the region 380-480°C), and continuous oxidation with desorption, i.e., combustion (above 500°C)."

The oxidation of hydrogenated diamond surfaces was conducted in an oxygen environment at various temperatures ranging from 300°C to 1000°C. The FTIR spectra revealed that the oxidation resulted in the formation of species containing C-O and C-O-C structures on the diamond surface above 300°C. TPD analysis showed that oxygen-containing species were desorbed as CO and CO2 above 480°C. The maximum oxygen coverage was achieved between 480 and 500°C. The process was divided into three stages: dehydrogenation (300-380°C), oxygenation (380-480°C), and continuous oxidation with desorption (500°C and above).

氢化金刚石表面的氧化在氧气气氛中在300°C至1000°C的温度范围内进行。FTIR谱表明，氧化导致钻石表面形成含C-O和C-O-C结构的物种，高于300°C。TPD分析显示，氧含量物种在480°C以上被脱附为CO和CO2。最大氧覆盖率在480°C至500°C之间。该过程分为三个阶段：脱氢（300-380°C），氧化（380-480°C）和连续氧化与脱附（500°C以上）。
