[1] "Thermal oxidizing treatments of hydrogenated diamond surfaces have been performed in an O2 environment."
[2] "Oxidation of the hydrogenated diamond occurred above 300 "C and diamond started to burn out above 480 "C in 20% O2."
[3] "The structures of the chemisorbed species changed with the oxidation temperature."
[4] "The maximum coverage of oxygen was obtained between 480 and 500 "C."
[5] "TPD spectra of oxidized diamond indicated that the oxygen-containing species were desorbed as CO and CO, above 480C."
[6] "We propose that the oxidation of a hydrogenated diamond surface can be divided into three major stages as follows: (A) dehydrogenation (in the region 300-380 "C), (B) oxygenation (in the region 380-480 "C), (C) continuous oxidation with desorption, i.e. combustion (above 500 "C)."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes involve the formation of metal oxides, which can lead to poisoning and loss of activity. For Cr-based catalysts, deactivation might result from Cr being converted to a less active oxide form. For VOx catalysts, overoxidation can occur, leading to the formation of vanadium oxides that deactivate the catalyst. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, aim to restore the catalyst's activity by removing these deactivating species. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst type and the extent of deactivation. Air reoxidation can be effective for some catalysts but may lead to overoxidation, which is detrimental to VOx catalysts. CO2 addition during regeneration can mitigate overoxidation by forming vanadium carbides instead of vanadium oxides, preserving the catalyst's activity.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的失活主要原因是金属氧化物的形成，这可能导致中毒并降低活性。对于Cr基催化剂，失活可能来自于Cr转化为活性较低的氧化物形式。对于VOx催化剂，过氧化可能会发生，导致形成会使催化剂失活的钒氧化物。各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，旨在通过去除这些失活物种来恢复催化剂的活性。这些方法的有效性取决于催化剂的特定类型和失活的程度。空气再氧化可能对某些催化剂有效，但可能会导致过氧化，这对VOx催化剂不利。在再生过程中添加CO2可以减少过氧化，通过形成钒碳化物而不是钒氧化物来保护催化剂的活性。
