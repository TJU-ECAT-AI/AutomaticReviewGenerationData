The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is often attributed to overoxidation, particularly in catalysts such as Cr-based and VOx. Various regeneration methods aim to restore catalyst activity. Reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be employed. Air reoxidation generally requires higher temperatures compared to CO2 and O2 reoxidation, which are more effective in removing less stable oxygen species, thereby preserving more of the catalyst's active sites. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively removing oxygen without causing excessive degradation of the catalyst.

Answer: The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes is overoxidation, affecting catalysts like Cr-based and VOx. Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 aim to restore activity. Air reoxidation typically necessitates higher temperatures than CO2 and O2 reoxidation, which are more effective in removing less stable oxygen species while conserving more active sites. CO2 addition helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by selectively removing oxygen without causing excessive catalyst degradation.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的主要失效原因是过氧化，尤其是Cr基和VOx催化剂。不同的再生方法旨在恢复催化剂活性。空气、CO2或O2的再氧化可以被使用。与CO2和O2再氧化相比，空气再氧化通常需要更高的温度，而CO2和O2再氧化则更有效地去除不稳定氧物种，从而保留更多催化剂的活性位点。CO2添加有助于缓解VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，通过选择性地去除氧气而不造成催化剂过量降解来减轻过氧化作用。

The oxidation of hydrogenated diamond surfaces was conducted in an oxygen environment at various temperatures ranging from 300°C to 1000°C. The FTIR spectra revealed that the oxidation resulted in the formation of species containing C-O and C-O-C structures on the diamond surface above 300°C. TPD analysis showed that oxygen-containing species were desorbed as CO and CO2 above 480°C. The maximum oxygen coverage was achieved between 480 and 500°C. The process was divided into three stages: dehydrogenation (300-380°C), oxygenation (380-480°C), and continuous oxidation with desorption (500°C and above).

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes involve the formation of metal oxides, which can lead to poisoning and loss of activity. For Cr-based catalysts, deactivation might result from Cr being converted to a less active oxide form. For VOx catalysts, overoxidation can occur, leading to the formation of vanadium oxides that deactivate the catalyst. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, aim to restore the catalyst's activity by removing these deactivating species. The effectiveness of these methods depends on the specific catalyst type and the extent of deactivation. Air reoxidation can be effective for some catalysts but may lead to overoxidation, which is detrimental to VOx catalysts. CO2 addition during regeneration can mitigate overoxidation by forming vanadium carbides instead of vanadium oxides, preserving the catalyst's activity.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中的失活主要原因是金属氧化物的形成，这可能导致中毒并降低活性。对于Cr基催化剂，失活可能来自于Cr转化为活性较低的氧化物形式。对于VOx催化剂，过氧化可能会发生，导致形成会使催化剂失活的钒氧化物。各种再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，旨在通过去除这些失活物种来恢复催化剂的活性。这些方法的有效性取决于催化剂的特定类型和失活的程度。空气再氧化可能对某些催化剂有效，但可能会导致过氧化，这对VOx催化剂不利。在再生过程中添加CO2可以减少过氧化，通过形成钒碳化物而不是钒氧化物来保护催化剂的活性。
