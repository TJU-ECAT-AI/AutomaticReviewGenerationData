[C1] "Chemisorption on a variety of carbon compounds such as graphite, carbon black, carbon fibres, and coal has been extensively studied by an array of different spectroscopic techniques."
[C2] "Although diamond is one of the most important and interesting forms of carbonaceous materials, few studies have been reported on the oxidation of diamond surfaces."
[C3] "The characterization of chemisorbed species on diamond surfaces is of great interest because of its role in the stabilization of diamond surface structures and its giving vital information for the understanding of chemical vapour deposition processes."
[C4] "Significant amounts of oxygen are present on both natural surfaces and those polished in an aqueous medium."
[C5] "It has been also reported that diamond growth is significantly affected by the presence of a small amount of oxygen during chemical vapour deposition."
[C6] "However, no detailed information on the reactivity of diamond surfaces towards oxidation have been reported."
[C7] "The authors propose that the oxidation of a hydrogenated diamond surface can be divided into three major stages as follows: (A) dehydrogenation (in the region 300-380 "C), (B) oxygenation (in the region 380-480 "C), (C) continuous oxidation with desorption, i.e. combustion (above 500 "C)."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not addressed in the provided document. The document discusses the oxidation of diamond surfaces, detailing stages of dehydrogenation, oxygenation, and continuous oxidation with desorption. However, the specifics of catalyst deactivation, regeneration methods, and their comparative effectiveness are not within the scope of the provided literature.
