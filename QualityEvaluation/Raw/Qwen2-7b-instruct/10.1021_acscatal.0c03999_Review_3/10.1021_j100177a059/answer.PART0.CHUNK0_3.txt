After dehydration at 200 °C under vacuum, the 31P spectrum of the sample becomes poorly resolved, altering the relative intensities of the signals. The 27AI spectrum of the anhydrous calcined sample exhibits a notable reduction in the intensity of the octahedral aluminum signal and a minor presence of AI species at approximately 5.5 ppm. The adsorption of N2 on calcined VPI-5 results in a surface area of around 117 m2/g, which corresponds to 3 N2 molecules per unit cell of VPI-5.

在真空条件下于200 °C下脱水后，样品的31P谱变得解析度差，信号相对强度发生变化。无水煅烧样品的27AI谱显示八面体铝信号的强度显著降低，并且大约在5.5 ppm处存在少量AI物种。N2在VPI-5煅烧样品上的吸附导致表面面积约为117 m2/g，相当于每单位晶胞中3个N2分子。
