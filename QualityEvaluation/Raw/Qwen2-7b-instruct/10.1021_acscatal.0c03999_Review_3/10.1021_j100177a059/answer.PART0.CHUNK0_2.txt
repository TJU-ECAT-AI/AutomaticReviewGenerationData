If strong interactions were to occur between the OH groups and the water molecules, the resolution of the corresponding vibrations would be reduced and they would shift toward lower wavenumbers.13 The )'P MAS NMR spectrum of n-DPA-VPI-5 (not shown) contains three signals with chemical shifts of -23.3, -27.2, and -33.1 ppm in the intensity ratio 1:l:l. The 27Al MAS NMR spectrum (see Figure 6) shows the presence of 4-coordinated A104 and 6-coordinated A106 environments at 41.6 and ca. -1 5 ppm,respectively. The similarity of the 31P and 27AI MAS spectra of n-DPA-VPI-5 and TBA-VPI-5 suggests that the deficiency of phosphorus atoms on the three kinds of crystallographically in- equivalent P sites in n-DPA-VPI-5 is random and that the dis- tortion of AI environments due to this deficiency is not reflected in the 27AI MAS NMR spectrum.

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, as discussed in the literature, involve the interaction of OH groups with water molecules, leading to reduced resolution and shifted vibrational frequencies. The presence of impurities in the catalyst is also mentioned as a reason for irreversible phase transformations. The regeneration methods compared in the literature include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. These methods vary in terms of temperature requirements and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition is suggested as a method to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

文献中讨论的氧化脱氢过程催化剂失活的主要原因涉及OH基团与水分子的相互作用，导致振动分辨率降低和频率偏移。催化剂中的杂质也被提及是不可逆相变的原因。文献中比较的再生方法包括空气、CO2或O2的氧化。这些方法在温度要求和对催化性能的影响上存在差异。建议通过向VOx催化反应中添加CO2来缓解过氧化。
