under vacuum is poorly resolved, and the relative intensities of the signals are altered."
[2] "The 27AI spectrum of an anhydrous calcined sample shows a significant decrease in the intensity of the octahedral aluminum signal and a small amount of AI species at ca. 5.5 ppm."
[3] "Adsorption of N2 on calcined VPI-5 gives the surface area to be ca. 117 m2/g, corresponding to 3 N2 molecules/unit cell of VPI-5."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are related to structural transformations during calcination and rehydration processes. The regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 vary in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The literature mentions that adsorption of N2 on calcined VPI-5 results in a specific surface area, indicating pore blockage by extraframework species produced during calcination. It also discusses the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失活的主要原因与结晶化和重新水合过程中的结构转变有关，特别是针对Cr基和VOx催化剂。再生方法如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化在有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。文献提到，煅烧后的VPI-5上吸附的N2导致特定的比表面积，表明孔被煅烧过程中产生的额外框架物种堵塞。它还讨论了CO2添加可能在VOx催化反应中缓解过氧化的可能性。
