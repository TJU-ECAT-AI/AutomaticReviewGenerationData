The 31P spectrum of a sample carefully dehydrated at 200 °C under vacuum is poorly resolved, and the relative intensities of the signals are altered. The spectrum, particularly the relative intensities of the peaks, depends upon calcination conditions and the hydration state of the calcined sample.
The 27AI spectrum of an anhydrous calcined sample shows a significant decrease in the intensity of the octahedral aluminum signal and a small amount of AI species at ca. 5.5 ppm.
Adsorption of N2 on calcined VPI-5 gives the surface area to be ca. 117 m2/g, corresponding to 3 N2 molecules/unit cell of VPI-5.
This indicates that the pores are almost completely blocked by the extraframework species produced during calcination.
Several groups of researchers have suggested that the reason for the irreversible phase transformation in VPI-5 may be the presence of impurities.
Derouane et al. claim that such impurities can be removed with hot ethanol.
Following their procedures precisely, we washed our n-DPA-VPI-5 with hot absolute ethanol at 60 °C for 1 h and calcined the washed sample at 200 °C for 1.5 h.
However, XRD showed that the washing does not prevent the onset of structural transformation.

The primary cause of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, might be the presence of impurities. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The document does not provide specific comparisons between these methods, nor does it detail the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The text discusses the effects of dehydration, calcination, and washing on the structure of VPI-5, which contains aluminum and phosphorus, but it does not directly address the deactivation of Cr-based and VOx catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

在氧化脱氢过程中，Cr基和VOx催化剂失活的主要原因可能是杂质的存在。不同的再生方法，如用空气、CO2或O2进行氧化，其有效性、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。文档没有提供这些方法之间的具体比较，也没有详细说明CO2添加对于减轻VOx催化反应中过氧化的可能性。文本讨论了VPI-5（包含铝和磷）的脱水、煅烧和清洗对其结构的影响，但并未直接涉及氧化脱氢过程中Cr基和VOx催化剂的失活问题。
