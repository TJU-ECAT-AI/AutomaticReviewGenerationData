[1] "In view of the presence of intense IR absorption bands of OH groups, it is obvious that the amount of strongly chemi-sorbed water cannot be significant."
[2] "The similarity of the 31P and 27AI MAS spectra of n-DPA-VPI-5 and TBA-VPI-5 suggests that the deficiency of phosphorus atoms on the three kinds of crystallographically in-equivalent P sites in n-DPA-VPI-5 is random."
[3] "A deconvolution of the 31P spectrum reveals the presence of five peaks at -22.6, -25.7, -26.9, -29.1, and -31.1 ppm in the intensity ratio l:l:l:l:4.5, while the 27AI spectrum of hydrated calcined n-DPA-VPI-5 shows the presence of 4- and 6-coordinate AI in the intensity ratio 2:l."
[4] "This indicates that the pores are almost completely blocked by the extraframework species produced during calcination."
[5] "Following their procedures precisely, we washed our n-DPA-VPI-5 with hot absolute ethanol at 60 °C for 1 h and calcined the washed sample at 200 °C for 1.5 h. However, XRD showed that the washing does not prevent the onset of structural transformation."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes might include adsorption of water, which leads to blockage of pores and affects catalytic performance. The regeneration methods discussed in the document include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2. While the effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance vary, reoxidation with CO2 might mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, as it selectively removes oxygen without causing excessive degradation of the catalyst structure.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因可能包括水的吸附，导致孔隙堵塞，影响催化性能。讨论的再生方法包括空气、CO2或O2的氧化。这些方法的有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响各不相同。CO2选择性去除氧而不造成催化剂结构过度降解的方法可能能减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化现象。
