[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke formation. This coke is observed in three forms: on and in the vicinity of the metal, on the carrier, and as graphitic coke on the carrier. A model suggests that the coke responsible for deactivation forms concurrently with the main coke and is not directly linked to the deactivation mechanism. The relationship between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is influenced by temperature rather than gas composition.

氧化脱氢反应中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭形成。在三种形式中观察到焦炭：靠近金属的表面、载体上以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。提出了一种模型，表明导致失活的焦炭与主要焦炭同时形成，并且与失活机制无关。导致失活的焦炭（Coke B）与主要焦炭（Coke A）的关系受到温度的影响，而不是气体组成的影响。
