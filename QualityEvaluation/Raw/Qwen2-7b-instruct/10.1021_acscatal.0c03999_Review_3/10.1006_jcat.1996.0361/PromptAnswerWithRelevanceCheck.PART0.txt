What are the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation (focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts) in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and how do various regeneration methods (such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2) compare in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance, including the potential of CO2 addition for mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions?

<quotes>
[1] "The experiments, where the free metal surface was measured on fresh and deactivated catalyst and on catalyst exposed to hydrogen, showed that the free metal surface on the deactivated Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was not changed significantly by treatment with hydrogen at 773 K. Fresh catalyst adsorbed 2.4 mol CO/g catalyst, and both the deactivated catalyst and the deactivated catalyst treated with hydrogen absorbed about 0.05 mol CO/g catalyst."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen treatment at 773 K did not significantly change the free metal surface on the deactivated Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. Fresh catalyst adsorbed 2.4 mol CO/g, while both deactivated and hydrogen-treated deactivated catalysts absorbed about 0.05 mol CO/g.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在773 K下，氢处理没有显著改变失活的Pt/Al2O3催化剂的自由金属表面。新鲜催化剂吸附了2.4 mol CO/g，而失活催化剂和氢处理后的失活催化剂都吸附了大约0.05 mol CO/g。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "We suggest that the major part of the coke is not responsible for the deactivation. Instead we propose a model where the coke active in deactivating the catalyst is formed in parallel with the main coke formation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We propose that the major portion of the coke does not cause deactivation. Instead, the deactivating coke is formed concurrently with the primary coke formation process.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
我们认为主要部分的焦炭不是导致失活的原因。相反，用于失活的焦炭是在主要焦炭形成的同时形成的。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "The formation of ethane and ethene during propane dehydrogenation under different reaction conditions showed a very slow deactivation of the ethene formation reaction on the PtSn catalyst. The activity was higher for both the ethene and ethane formation on the monometallic catalyst than on the bimetallic one."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
During propane dehydrogenation at varying conditions, the ethene formation reaction exhibited extremely slow deactivation on the PtSn catalyst. Monometallic catalysts showed higher activity for both ethene and ethane formation compared to the bimetallic catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在不同反应条件下进行丙烷脱氢时，PtSn催化剂上的乙炔形成反应表现出极慢的失活速度。单金属催化剂的活性高于双金属催化剂，对于乙炔和乙烷的形成均表现更高。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation. On the other hand, it was not possible to remove any coke after the reaction stopped."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen has been shown to effectively preserve catalyst activity and inhibit coke formation. However, it is not capable of removing any coke once the reaction is completed.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氢已经证明能够高效地维持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭生成。然而，在反应结束后，它无法去除任何焦炭。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased. Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Experiments with varying 'time on stream' showed that the first peak stabilized around 15 hours, whereas the second continued to rise. Hydrogen was highly effective in averting coke formation and deactivation, yet it could not eliminate coke already present on the catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
具有不同“时间在流”实验显示，第一个峰值在约15小时后达到稳定水平，而第二个则继续增加。氢气在防止焦炭形成和失活方面非常有效，但无法清除催化剂上已形成的焦炭。

<quotes>
[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke formation. This coke is observed in three forms: on and in the vicinity of the metal, on the carrier, and as graphitic coke on the carrier. A model suggests that the coke responsible for deactivation forms concurrently with the main coke and is not directly linked to the deactivation mechanism. The relationship between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is influenced by temperature rather than gas composition.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氧化脱氢反应中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭形成。在三种形式中观察到焦炭：靠近金属的表面、载体上以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。提出了一种模型，表明导致失活的焦炭与主要焦炭同时形成，并且与失活机制无关。导致失活的焦炭（Coke B）与主要焦炭（Coke A）的关系受到温度的影响，而不是气体组成的影响。

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly detailed in the provided literature. However, the literature discusses the formation of different types of coke on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. The coke is categorized into three types: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The model suggests that the coke observed is not responsible for deactivation but is formed in parallel with another type of coke. Hydrogen is noted to be effective in reducing the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing the formation of coke precursors, yet it does not remove the coke already formed on the catalyst.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氧化脱氢反应中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的主活性丧失原因在提供的文献中并未详细说明。文献讨论了丙烷脱氢过程中Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上形成的不同类型的焦炭。焦炭被分为三种类型：金属附近和附近的焦炭、载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。提出的模型表明，观察到的焦炭不是导致失活的原因，而是与另一种焦炭并行形成。文献指出，氢可以减少失活速率和主要部分焦炭的形成，通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，但不能去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes involve coke formation. The coke can be categorized into three types: on and in the vicinity of the metal, on the carrier, and graphitic on the carrier. The coke responsible for deactivation (Coke B) forms in parallel with the major part of the coke (Coke A), whose relation to deactivation is independent of gas composition but depends on temperature. Graphitic coke on the carrier forms through a separate mechanism. Hydrogen can mitigate the deactivation rate and Coke A formation by suppressing precursor formation, but it does not remove already formed coke on the catalyst.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭形成。焦炭可以分为三种类型：靠近和位于金属附近的焦炭、载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。导致失活的焦炭（焦炭B）与主要部分的焦炭（焦炭A）同时形成，其与失活的关系不受气体组成的影响，但依赖于温度。载体上的石墨状焦炭通过独立机制形成。氢可以通过抑制前体形成来减少失活速率和焦炭A的形成，但无法去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。

Since there are no relevant quotes provided, specific information regarding the primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, the effectiveness of various regeneration methods, temperature requirements, and impacts on catalytic performance cannot be directly extracted. The text focuses on the study of coke formation during propane dehydrogenation and its effects on catalyst deactivation, rather than addressing the question asked.

由于没有相关引文提供，因此无法直接提取有关氧化脱氢过程中金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因、再生方法的有效性、温度要求及其对催化性能的影响的具体信息。文本主要关注了丙烷脱氢过程中焦炭形成及其对催化剂失活影响的研究，而不是回答提出的问题。
