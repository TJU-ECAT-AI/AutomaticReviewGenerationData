[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "The relation between the deactivating coke (Coke B) and the major part of the coke (Coke A) is independent of gas composition, but it is dependent on the temperature."
[6] "The graphitic type of coke on the carrier is formed via a separate mechanism, independent of the deactivation of the main reaction."
[7] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes involve coke formation. The coke can be categorized into three types: on and in the vicinity of the metal, on the carrier, and graphitic on the carrier. The coke responsible for deactivation (Coke B) forms in parallel with the major part of the coke (Coke A), whose relation to deactivation is independent of gas composition but depends on temperature. Graphitic coke on the carrier forms through a separate mechanism. Hydrogen can mitigate the deactivation rate and Coke A formation by suppressing precursor formation, but it does not remove already formed coke on the catalyst.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭形成。焦炭可以分为三种类型：靠近和位于金属附近的焦炭、载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。导致失活的焦炭（焦炭B）与主要部分的焦炭（焦炭A）同时形成，其与失活的关系不受气体组成的影响，但依赖于温度。载体上的石墨状焦炭通过独立机制形成。氢可以通过抑制前体形成来减少失活速率和焦炭A的形成，但无法去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。
