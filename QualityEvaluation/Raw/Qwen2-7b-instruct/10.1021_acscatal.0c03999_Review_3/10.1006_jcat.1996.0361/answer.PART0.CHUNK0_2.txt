[1] "Three different peaks were detected in the TPO profiles."
[2] "The first was found to be coke on and in the vicinity of the metal."
[3] "The second peak was coke on the carrier, and the third one was graphitic coke on the carrier."
[4] "We suggested a model which proposes that the coke observed is not responsible for the deactivation but formed in parallel."
[5] "Hydrogen can reduce the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing coke precursor formation, but it cannot remove the coke already formed on the catalyst."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, are not explicitly detailed in the provided literature. However, the literature discusses the formation of different types of coke on Pt/Al2O3 and PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation. The coke is categorized into three types: coke on and in the vicinity of the metal, coke on the carrier, and graphitic coke on the carrier. The model suggests that the coke observed is not responsible for deactivation but is formed in parallel with another type of coke. Hydrogen is noted to be effective in reducing the deactivation rate and formation of the main part of the coke by suppressing the formation of coke precursors, yet it does not remove the coke already formed on the catalyst.

氧化脱氢反应中，Cr基和VOx催化剂的主活性丧失原因在提供的文献中并未详细说明。文献讨论了丙烷脱氢过程中Pt/Al2O3和PtSn/Al2O3催化剂上形成的不同类型的焦炭。焦炭被分为三种类型：金属附近和附近的焦炭、载体上的焦炭以及载体上的石墨状焦炭。提出的模型表明，观察到的焦炭不是导致失活的原因，而是与另一种焦炭并行形成。文献指出，氢可以减少失活速率和主要部分焦炭的形成，通过抑制焦炭前体的形成，但不能去除催化剂上已经形成的焦炭。
