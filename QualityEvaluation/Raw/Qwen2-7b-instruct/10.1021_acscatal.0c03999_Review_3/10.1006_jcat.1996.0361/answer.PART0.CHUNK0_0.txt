[1] "The experiments, where the free metal surface was measured on fresh and deactivated catalyst and on catalyst exposed to hydrogen, showed that the free metal surface on the deactivated Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was not changed significantly by treatment with hydrogen at 773 K. Fresh catalyst adsorbed 2.4 mol CO/g catalyst, and both the deactivated catalyst and the deactivated catalyst treated with hydrogen absorbed about 0.05 mol CO/g catalyst."

在773 K下，氢处理没有显著改变失活的Pt/Al2O3催化剂的自由金属表面。新鲜催化剂吸附了2.4 mol CO/g，而失活催化剂和氢处理后的失活催化剂都吸附了大约0.05 mol CO/g。

[1] "We suggest that the major part of the coke is not responsible for the deactivation. Instead we propose a model where the coke active in deactivating the catalyst is formed in parallel with the main coke formation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We propose that the major portion of the coke does not cause deactivation. Instead, the deactivating coke is formed concurrently with the primary coke formation process.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
我们认为主要部分的焦炭不是导致失活的原因。相反，用于失活的焦炭是在主要焦炭形成的同时形成的。

[1] "The formation of ethane and ethene during propane dehydrogenation under different reaction conditions showed a very slow deactivation of the ethene formation reaction on the PtSn catalyst. The activity was higher for both the ethene and ethane formation on the monometallic catalyst than on the bimetallic one."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
During propane dehydrogenation at varying conditions, the ethene formation reaction exhibited extremely slow deactivation on the PtSn catalyst. Monometallic catalysts showed higher activity for both ethene and ethane formation compared to the bimetallic catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
在不同反应条件下进行丙烷脱氢时，PtSn催化剂上的乙炔形成反应表现出极慢的失活速度。单金属催化剂的活性高于双金属催化剂，对于乙炔和乙烷的形成均表现更高。

[1] "Hydrogen has proven to be very efficient in maintaining the activity of the catalyst and also suppressing the coke formation. On the other hand, it was not possible to remove any coke after the reaction stopped."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Hydrogen has been shown to effectively preserve catalyst activity and inhibit coke formation. However, it is not capable of removing any coke once the reaction is completed.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氢已经证明能够高效地维持催化剂活性并抑制焦炭生成。然而，在反应结束后，它无法去除任何焦炭。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
[1] "The experiments with different time on stream revealed that the first peak reached a constant level after about 15 h, while the second one still increased. Hydrogen was very efficient in preventing coke formation and deactivation but could not remove coke already formed on the catalyst."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Experiments with varying 'time on stream' showed that the first peak stabilized around 15 hours, whereas the second continued to rise. Hydrogen was highly effective in averting coke formation and deactivation, yet it could not eliminate coke already present on the catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
具有不同“时间在流”实验显示，第一个峰值在约15小时后达到稳定水平，而第二个则继续增加。氢气在防止焦炭形成和失活方面非常有效，但无法清除催化剂上已形成的焦炭。
