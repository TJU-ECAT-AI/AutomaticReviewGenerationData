[1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
[3] "For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."
[4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
[5] "Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."
[6] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
[7] "However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability."
[8] "To overcome this issue, Botavina et al. have prepared highly dispersed CrSiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis."
[9] "By following the procedure of MCM-41 synthesis, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit MCM-41-type mesoporous structure with high surface area (6001000 m2 g−1)."
[10] "Spectroscopic studies (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) reveal that the average oxidation state of Cr in CO2ODHP is 2+, which is lower than that (i.e., Cr3+) in the presence of co-fed O2."
[11] "An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity."
[12] "Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue."
[13] "Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI."
[14] "Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse."
[15] "VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity."
[16] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
[17] "Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during reaction, including monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite."
[18] "Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."
[19] "V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2ODHP and DHP routes."
[20] "Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+OH) to bridge oxygen desorption of H2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and reduction of active sites, particularly in Cr-based catalysts. Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in effectiveness and temperature requirements. Reoxidation with O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, showing a repeatable recovery after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant allows for a complete recovery in the second cycle but fails to prevent further deactivation beyond that. CO2 addition in the feed gas can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by adjusting adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. The redox states of Cr and V play crucial roles in their activity, with CO2ODHP leading to a lower average oxidation state of Cr (2+) compared to the presence of co-fed O2 (Cr3+).

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原，特别是Cr基催化剂。再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，其有效性和温度要求各不相同。在600°C下用O2进行5分钟的再氧化可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，并且这种恢复在4个周期后是可重复的。使用CO2作为再生氧化剂仅允许在第二周期内完成完全恢复，之后则无法防止催化剂进一步失效。在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2可以通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来缓解过氧化，从而减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化问题。Cr和V的还原态对于它们的活性至关重要，在CO2ODHP过程中，Cr的平均氧化状态降低（2+）与共喂养的O2（Cr3+）相比。
