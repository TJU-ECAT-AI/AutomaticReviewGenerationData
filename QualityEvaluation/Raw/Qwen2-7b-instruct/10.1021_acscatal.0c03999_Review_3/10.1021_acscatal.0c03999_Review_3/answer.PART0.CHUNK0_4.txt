3.1.1.5. Deactivation and Regeneration
"Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
"Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
"Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
"Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."
"By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
"From a practical point of view, increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is necessary to attain comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial requirements."
"However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability."
"To overcome this issue, Botavina et al. have prepared highly dispersed CrSiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis."
"By following the procedure of MCM-41 synthesis, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit MCM-41-type mesoporous structure with high surface area (6001000 m2 g1)."
"Long-term tests demonstrate better stability of Cr2.0SiO2 in C3H8 conversion after 900 min on stream in the joint presence of CO2 and O2 (Figure 6A), but accompanied by a lower C3H6 yield than the other reaction conditions (Figure 6B)."
"As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, the unique pore structure and large surface area of mesoporous support materials are effective in confining the growth of Cr species and affecting dispersion and structure of Cr species."
"However, the preservation of pore structure and porosity under reaction conditions is challenging."
"Michorczyk et al. find that the irreversible degradation of the pore structure after multiple cycles leads to decreased selectivity on Cr0.04-SBA-1."
"An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity."
"Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue."
"Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI."
"Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse."
"3.1.2. Vanadium(V)-Based Catalysts"
"3.1.2.1. Identification of Active V Sites and Redox Cycle"
"VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity."
"Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts."
"Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
"3.1.2.2. Effects of Support"
"Mesoporous silica has been introduced as support to prepare VOx catalysts with high dispersion."
"However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, leading to low catalytic activity."
"Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores with highly dispersed VOx species are desired."
"Xue et al. have prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) and used them as support for VOx catalysts."
"The catalysts have been prepared via an oilwater biphase stratification reaction system that allows the delicate control of monolayer coverage and prohibit agglomeration of V species to V2O5."
"Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst."
"3.1.2.3. Effects of Promoter"
"VOx/SiO2 possesses a lower monolayer coverage of VOx (3.3 V nm2) compared to more reactive oxide support materials such as Al2O3 (78 V nm2)."
"To enrich the surface VOx species with monovanadate and improve their retention against compression to form polymerized species or bulk V2O5, incorporating another metal component featuring a noninteracting nature offers avenues to achieve this goal."
"Tungsten oxide (WOx) is known to influence the dispersion of VOx in this regard."
"Ascoop et al. have introduced WOx into VOx/SiO2 catalysts for CO2ODHP."
"The highest C3H6 turnover frequency (TOF) is obtained at W/V = 0.1 molar ratio, while W/V = 0.6 achieves the highest C3H6 selectivity."
"Sandupatla et al. have carried out comparative studies among Cr2O3-, MoO3-, and WO3-modifed VOx/Al2O3 catalysts under a monolayer VOx coverage."
"The catalytic performance of monometallic oxide catalysts decreases in the order of V > Cr > Mo > W (Table 4), and both Mo and W display poor activity."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Reoxidation with air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) is widely applied, allowing for the recovery of most activity and selectivity. Using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant enables a complete recovery in the second cycle but fails to prevent further deactivation beyond that. Co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP promotes coke removal during the reaction, albeit at the cost of a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but possible with the use of well-dispersed Cr species. Increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is crucial for achieving comparable catalytic performance meeting industrial requirements. However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 limits activity and stability. Alternative methods, such as direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis to prepare CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area, offer solutions to overcome issues related to pore structure and porosity degradation. Proper synthetic methods and controlled Cr loading can help maintain pore structure and reduce deactivation caused by pore collapse. For VOx catalysts, adding CO2 to the feed gas helps neutralize overoxidation sites by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. Incorporating noninteracting metal components, such as tungsten oxide (WOx), can enhance dispersion and improve retention against compression, potentially enriching surface VOx species with monovanadate and preventing the formation of polymerized species or bulk V2O5.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括焦炭沉积和活性位点的减少。对于Cr基和VOx催化剂而言，不同的再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2氧化）在效率、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。在550-650°C的高温下进行空气或CO2的再氧化，可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。将CO2用作再生氧化剂仅能在第二循环中实现完全恢复，之后则无法防止催化剂进一步失效。在CO2ODHP反应中，通过共供O2促进焦炭去除，但会伴随着C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的急剧下降。完全恢复活性位点较为困难，但使用分散良好的Cr物种的方法是可行的。增加Cr负载并保持高分散度对于达到满足工业需求的类似催化性能至关重要。然而，形成不可活性的结晶α-Cr2O3限制了活性并导致稳定性降低。通过直接一锅水热合成制备具有高比表面积的CrSiO2催化剂提供了解决孔结构和孔隙度降解问题的方案。适当的合成方法和控制Cr负载有助于维持孔结构并减少由孔塌陷引起的不可逆失活。对于VOx催化剂，向气体中添加CO2有助于通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来消除过氧化，从而中和过氧化位点。引入不相互作用的金属成分，例如钨酸盐（WOx），可以增强分散度并提高对抗压缩时形成聚合物化物种或Bulk V2O5的保留能力，有可能丰富表面VOx物种中的单钒酸盐，并防止形成聚合物化物种或Bulk V2O5。
