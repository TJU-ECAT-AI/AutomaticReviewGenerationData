[10] "Spectroscopic studies (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) reveal that the average oxidation state of Cr in CO2ODHP is 2+, which is lower than that (i.e., Cr3+) in the presence of co-fed O2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and reduction of active sites, particularly in Cr-based catalysts. Regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in effectiveness and temperature requirements. Reoxidation with O2 at 600°C for 5 minutes can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, showing a repeatable recovery after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant allows for a complete recovery in the second cycle but fails to prevent further deactivation beyond that. CO2 addition in the feed gas can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by adjusting adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. The redox states of Cr and V play crucial roles in their activity, with CO2ODHP leading to a lower average oxidation state of Cr (2+) compared to the presence of co-fed O2 (Cr3+).

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原，特别是Cr基催化剂。再生方法，如使用空气、CO2或O2进行再氧化，其有效性和温度要求各不相同。在600°C下用O2进行5分钟的再氧化可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，并且这种恢复在4个周期后是可重复的。使用CO2作为再生氧化剂仅允许在第二周期内完成完全恢复，之后则无法防止催化剂进一步失效。在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2可以通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来缓解过氧化，从而减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化问题。Cr和V的还原态对于它们的活性至关重要，在CO2ODHP过程中，Cr的平均氧化状态降低（2+）与共喂养的O2（Cr3+）相比。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts include coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are effective for recovering most of the activity and selectivity. Using CO2 alone for regeneration allows a complete recovery in the second cycle but fails to prevent further deactivation. Co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke, though it comes with a significant drop in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites can be achieved with proper preparation of well-dispersed Cr species. Increasing Cr loading while maintaining high dispersion is crucial for achieving industrial-level catalytic performance.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
催化剂失活的主要原因包括焦炭沉积和活性位点的减少。在550-650°C的高温下，使用空气或二氧化碳进行再生可以有效恢复大部分活性和选择性。仅使用二氧化碳进行再生，在第二周期内可以实现完全恢复，但无法防止催化剂进一步失活。在二氧化碳ODHP中加入氧气有助于去除焦炭，但会伴随着C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的大幅下降。通过适当的方法制备分散良好的Cr物种，可以获得完全恢复活性位点的可能性。提高Cr负载量并保持高分散度是实现工业级催化性能的关键。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Vanadium(V)-based catalysts, represented by VOx, are extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, but overoxidation continues to hinder efforts to achieve high C3H6 selectivity. Incorporating CO2 into the feed gas mixture of C3H8/O2 is a promising strategy. It reduces the concentration of surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by adjusting the adsorption-desorption equilibrium at basic oxidizing sites.

在O2ODHP反应中，代表性的VOx是广泛研究的红氧化合物，但过氧化继续阻碍了达到高C3H6选择性的努力。将CO2加入C3H8/O2的进气气体中是一个有前景的方法。通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，它降低了负责过氧化的表面分子氧物种的浓度。

The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Reoxidation is effective in reversing coke deposition, while CO2 can help inhibit coking or remove coke in situ. High-temperature regeneration in air or CO2 is commonly applied, restoring most of the activity and selectivity. Oxygen at 600°C can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with repeatability observed after several cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation thereafter. Adding oxygen during CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation can promote coke removal but negatively impacts C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but possible with well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation hinders achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing sites prone to overoxidation. Catalytic performance of VOx depends on its structure, dispersion, and interaction with the support. Four types of VOx species exist: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Isothermal reduction shows that CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 but cannot completely reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports have been used for VOx catalysts but result in low activity due to long, isolated channels. To address this, Xue et al. developed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) as a support, enabling higher C3H6 selectivity and comparable C3H8 conversion. These catalysts can be fully recovered after simple reoxidation in air.

Cr催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。通过氧化可以逆转焦炭沉积，而CO2有助于原位去除焦炭或抑制焦炭生成过程。高温下在空气中或CO2中再生通常可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。在600°C的氧气中进行5分钟的再生可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，并且在多次循环后保持可重复性。使用CO2作为氧化剂只能在第二轮循环中实现完全恢复，之后无法防止催化剂进一步失活。在CO2氧化脱氢过程中添加氧气可以促进焦炭的去除，但会伴随C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的大幅下降。通过适当的方法制备分散良好的Cr物种，可以获得完全恢复活性位点的可能性。对于VOx基催化剂，过氧化会阻碍实现高C3H6选择性。通过在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2，可以调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少表面分子氧物种，从而降低过氧化的影响。催化性能取决于VOx的结构、分散性和与支持物的相互作用。反应期间存在四种类型的VOx物种：单钒酸盐、寡聚钒酸盐、多聚钒酸盐和V2O5晶粒。等温还原结果显示，CO2不能完全将催化剂重新氧化为V2O5，但可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4。提出了包含CO2ODHP、DHP和RWGS的整个反应网络中硅氧烷簇中孤立的V5+OV3+对的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算所提出的红ox机制。V4+在CO2ODHP和DHP途径中都扮演着激活C3H8（RDS）中次级CH键的关键角色。然而，活性V位点的再生方式不同：V3+可以通过解离CO2吸附进行氧化，而在DHP中，则是通过桥氧到V3+的氢迁移、桥氧到范德华氧（V5+OH）的氢迁移以及H2的脱附。值得注意的是，已知存在另一种红ox循环，如氧化金刚石支持的VOx催化剂上的V5+ V4+循环。对于以二氧化硅多孔材料为载体的VOx催化剂，尽管其具有长而孤立的通道和低的传质效率，导致催化活性较低。因此，需要短程有序的多孔结构和高度分散的VOx物种。Xue等人通过油水两相分层反应系统制备了均匀、单分散的三维树状多孔二氧化硅纳米球（3D树状MSNSs），并将其用作VOx催化剂的支撑。这种催化剂能够通过简单的空气氧化完全恢复活性和选择性，在与其他催化剂比较时显示更高的C3H6选择性和相当的C3H8转化率。这些催化剂可以在空气中完全恢复活性。

3.1.1.5. Deactivation and Regeneration
"Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
"Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
"Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
"Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."
"By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
"From a practical point of view, increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is necessary to attain comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial requirements."
"However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability."
"To overcome this issue, Botavina et al. have prepared highly dispersed CrSiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis."
"By following the procedure of MCM-41 synthesis, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit MCM-41-type mesoporous structure with high surface area (6001000 m2 g1)."
"Long-term tests demonstrate better stability of Cr2.0SiO2 in C3H8 conversion after 900 min on stream in the joint presence of CO2 and O2 (Figure 6A), but accompanied by a lower C3H6 yield than the other reaction conditions (Figure 6B)."
"As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, the unique pore structure and large surface area of mesoporous support materials are effective in confining the growth of Cr species and affecting dispersion and structure of Cr species."
"However, the preservation of pore structure and porosity under reaction conditions is challenging."
"Michorczyk et al. find that the irreversible degradation of the pore structure after multiple cycles leads to decreased selectivity on Cr0.04-SBA-1."
"An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity."
"Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue."
"Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI."
"Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse."
"3.1.2. Vanadium(V)-Based Catalysts"
"3.1.2.1. Identification of Active V Sites and Redox Cycle"
"VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity."
"Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts."
"Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
"3.1.2.2. Effects of Support"
"Mesoporous silica has been introduced as support to prepare VOx catalysts with high dispersion."
"However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, leading to low catalytic activity."
"Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores with highly dispersed VOx species are desired."
"Xue et al. have prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) and used them as support for VOx catalysts."
"The catalysts have been prepared via an oilwater biphase stratification reaction system that allows the delicate control of monolayer coverage and prohibit agglomeration of V species to V2O5."
"Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst."
"3.1.2.3. Effects of Promoter"
"VOx/SiO2 possesses a lower monolayer coverage of VOx (3.3 V nm2) compared to more reactive oxide support materials such as Al2O3 (78 V nm2)."
"To enrich the surface VOx species with monovanadate and improve their retention against compression to form polymerized species or bulk V2O5, incorporating another metal component featuring a noninteracting nature offers avenues to achieve this goal."
"Tungsten oxide (WOx) is known to influence the dispersion of VOx in this regard."
"Ascoop et al. have introduced WOx into VOx/SiO2 catalysts for CO2ODHP."
"The highest C3H6 turnover frequency (TOF) is obtained at W/V = 0.1 molar ratio, while W/V = 0.6 achieves the highest C3H6 selectivity."
"Sandupatla et al. have carried out comparative studies among Cr2O3-, MoO3-, and WO3-modifed VOx/Al2O3 catalysts under a monolayer VOx coverage."
"The catalytic performance of monometallic oxide catalysts decreases in the order of V > Cr > Mo > W (Table 4), and both Mo and W display poor activity."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. Reoxidation with air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) is widely applied, allowing for the recovery of most activity and selectivity. Using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant enables a complete recovery in the second cycle but fails to prevent further deactivation beyond that. Co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP promotes coke removal during the reaction, albeit at the cost of a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but possible with the use of well-dispersed Cr species. Increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is crucial for achieving comparable catalytic performance meeting industrial requirements. However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 limits activity and stability. Alternative methods, such as direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis to prepare CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area, offer solutions to overcome issues related to pore structure and porosity degradation. Proper synthetic methods and controlled Cr loading can help maintain pore structure and reduce deactivation caused by pore collapse. For VOx catalysts, adding CO2 to the feed gas helps neutralize overoxidation sites by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites. Incorporating noninteracting metal components, such as tungsten oxide (WOx), can enhance dispersion and improve retention against compression, potentially enriching surface VOx species with monovanadate and preventing the formation of polymerized species or bulk V2O5.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括焦炭沉积和活性位点的减少。对于Cr基和VOx催化剂而言，不同的再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2氧化）在效率、温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。在550-650°C的高温下进行空气或CO2的再氧化，可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。将CO2用作再生氧化剂仅能在第二循环中实现完全恢复，之后则无法防止催化剂进一步失效。在CO2ODHP反应中，通过共供O2促进焦炭去除，但会伴随着C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的急剧下降。完全恢复活性位点较为困难，但使用分散良好的Cr物种的方法是可行的。增加Cr负载并保持高分散度对于达到满足工业需求的类似催化性能至关重要。然而，形成不可活性的结晶α-Cr2O3限制了活性并导致稳定性降低。通过直接一锅水热合成制备具有高比表面积的CrSiO2催化剂提供了解决孔结构和孔隙度降解问题的方案。适当的合成方法和控制Cr负载有助于维持孔结构并减少由孔塌陷引起的不可逆失活。对于VOx催化剂，向气体中添加CO2有助于通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来消除过氧化，从而中和过氧化位点。引入不相互作用的金属成分，例如钨酸盐（WOx），可以增强分散度并提高对抗压缩时形成聚合物化物种或Bulk V2O5的保留能力，有可能丰富表面VOx物种中的单钒酸盐，并防止形成聚合物化物种或Bulk V2O5。
