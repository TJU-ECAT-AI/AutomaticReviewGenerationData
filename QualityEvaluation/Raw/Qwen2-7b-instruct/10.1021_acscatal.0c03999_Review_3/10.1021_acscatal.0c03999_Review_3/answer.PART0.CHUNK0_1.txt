3.1.1.5. Deactivation and Regeneration
"Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
"Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
"Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
"Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."
"By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
"From a practical point of view, increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is necessary to attain comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial requirements."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts include coke deposition and the reduction of active sites. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are effective for recovering most of the activity and selectivity. Using CO2 alone for regeneration allows a complete recovery in the second cycle but fails to prevent further deactivation. Co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke, though it comes with a significant drop in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites can be achieved with proper preparation of well-dispersed Cr species. Increasing Cr loading while maintaining high dispersion is crucial for achieving industrial-level catalytic performance.

催化剂失活的主要原因包括焦炭沉积和活性位点的减少。在550-650°C的高温下，使用空气或二氧化碳进行再生可以有效恢复大部分活性和选择性。仅使用二氧化碳进行再生，在第二周期内可以实现完全恢复，但无法防止催化剂进一步失活。在二氧化碳ODHP中加入氧气有助于去除焦炭，但会伴随着C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的大幅下降。通过适当的方法制备分散良好的Cr物种，可以获得完全恢复活性位点的可能性。提高Cr负载量并保持高分散度是实现工业级催化性能的关键。

3.1.2. Vanadium(V)-Based Catalysts
"VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity."
"Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Vanadium(V)-based catalysts, represented by VOx, are extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, but overoxidation continues to hinder efforts to achieve high C3H6 selectivity. Incorporating CO2 into the feed gas mixture of C3H8/O2 is a promising strategy. It reduces the concentration of surface molecular oxygen species responsible for overoxidation by adjusting the adsorption-desorption equilibrium at basic oxidizing sites.

在O2ODHP反应中，代表性的VOx是广泛研究的红氧化合物，但过氧化继续阻碍了达到高C3H6选择性的努力。将CO2加入C3H8/O2的进气气体中是一个有前景的方法。通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，它降低了负责过氧化的表面分子氧物种的浓度。
