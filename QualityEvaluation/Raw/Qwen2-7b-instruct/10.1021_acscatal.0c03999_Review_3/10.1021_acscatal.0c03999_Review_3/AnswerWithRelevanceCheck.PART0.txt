          [1] "Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
          [2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
          [3] "For example, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."
          [4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
          [5] "Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."
          [6] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
          [7] "However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability."
          [8] "To overcome this issue, Botavina et al. have prepared highly dispersed CrSiO2 catalysts by direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis."
          [9] "By following the procedure of MCM-41 synthesis, the as-prepared catalysts exhibit MCM-41-type mesoporous structure with high surface area (6001000 m2 g−1)."
          [10] "Spectroscopic studies (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy) reveal that the average oxidation state of Cr in CO2ODHP is 2+, which is lower than that (i.e., Cr3+) in the presence of co-fed O2."
          [11] "An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity."
          [12] "Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue."
          [13] "Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI."
          [14] "Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse."
          [15] "VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity."
          [16] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
          [17] "Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during reaction, including monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite."
          [18] "Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."
          [19] "V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2ODHP and DHP routes."
          [20] "Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+OH) to bridge oxygen desorption of H2."

          The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Regeneration methods using air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are effective for restoring most of the activity and selectivity. Oxygen at 600°C for 5 minutes can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP helps remove coke but decreases C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but can be achieved with well-dispersed Cr species. The formation of inactive α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings limits activity and stability. To overcome this, CrSiO2 catalysts with high surface area can be prepared through direct one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. Controlling the Cr loading to maintain the unique pore structure sacrifices activity. Proper synthetic methods provide solutions to this issue. For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation impedes achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing overoxidation sites. Four types of VOx species are present during the reaction: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports are desirable for VOx catalysts, offering short-range, ordered mesopores and high dispersion of VOx species.

          Cr基催化剂失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。在550-650°C的高温下使用空气或CO2进行再生可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。在600°C下用5分钟的O2进行再生可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，并且这种恢复在4个周期后可以重复。仅在第二周期使用CO2作为氧化剂可以实现完全恢复，之后无法阻止催化剂进一步失效。在CO2ODHP过程中添加O2有助于去除焦炭，但会伴随C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的大幅下降。完全恢复活性位点较为困难，但可以通过制备分散良好的Cr物种来实现。在较高Cr负载下形成不可活性的α-Cr2O3限制了活性并影响稳定性。通过直接一锅水热合成制备具有高比表面积的CrSiO2催化剂可以解决这个问题。控制Cr负载以维持独特的孔结构会牺牲活性。选择合适的合成方法提供了克服这一问题的解决方案。对于VOx基催化剂，过氧化阻碍了实现高C3H6选择性。在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2有助于减少表面分子氧物种，从而消除过氧化位点。反应期间存在四种类型的VOx物种：单钒酸盐、寡聚钒酸盐、多聚钒酸盐和V2O5晶粒。已知存在另一种红ox循环，如氧化金刚石支持的VOx催化剂上的V5+ V4+ 循环。对于以二氧化硅多孔材料为载体的VOx催化剂，短程有序的多孔结构和高度分散的VOx物种是理想的。

          VOx, another redox-active metal oxide, has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, where overoxidation hinders the achievement of high C3H6 selectivity. Adding CO2 to the feed gas mixture of C3H8/O2 is a promising method, as it reduces the surface molecular oxygen species contributing to overoxidation by adjusting the adsorption-desorption equilibrium at basic oxidizing sites. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. For preparing VOx catalysts, mesoporous silica has been utilized as a support, offering high dispersion. However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, resulting in low catalytic activity. Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores and highly dispersed VOx species are preferred. Xue et al. successfully prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) as a support for VOx catalysts. By employing an oilwater biphase stratification reaction system, they achieved precise control over monolayer coverage, preventing the aggregation of V species into V2O5. After simple reoxidation in air, both conversion and selectivity could be fully restored.

          VOx是另一种在O2ODHP反应中被广泛研究的红氧化合物，过氧化阻碍了高C3H6选择性的实现。在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2是一种有前景的方法，它通过调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡来减少负责过氧化的表面分子氧物种。已知存在另一种红ox循环，如氧化金刚石支持的VOx催化剂上的V5+ V4+ 循环。为了制备VOx催化剂，二氧化硅多孔材料已被用作载体，提供高分散度。然而，这些材料具有长而孤立的通道和低的传质效率，导致催化活性较低。因此，需要具有短程有序的多孔结构和高度分散的VOx物种的多孔材料。Xue等人成功制备了均匀、单分散的三维树状多孔二氧化硅纳米球（3D树状MSNSs）作为VOx催化剂的支撑。通过油水两相分层反应系统，他们实现了对单层覆盖的精确控制，防止V物种聚集为V2O5。在空气中简单地进行再氧化后，转化率和选择性都能够完全恢复。
