3.1.1.5. Deactivation and Regeneration
"Coke deposition and reduction of active sites are major reasons for deactivation of Cr-based catalysts."
"Coking is relatively easier to reverse by reoxidation; moreover, the presence of CO2 can help to remove coke in situ through a reverse Boudouard reaction or to inhibit the coking process."
"Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550650 C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
"For example, regeneration in O2 at 600 C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."
"Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
"Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."
"By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
"As aforementioned (section 3.1.1.4), Baek et al. have introduced a (N0Mn+)I0 pathway to prepare MSU-x-supported Cr catalysts with highly dispersed Cr species."
"The activity can be completely recovered under simple oxidation in air at 650 C, retaining its repeatability after 6 cycles."
"As discussed in section 3.1.1.2, the unique pore structure and large surface area of mesoporous support materials are effective in confining the growth of Cr species and affecting dispersion and structure of Cr species."
"However, the preservation of pore structure and porosity under reaction conditions is challenging."
"Michorczyk et al. find that the irreversible degradation of the pore structure after multiple cycles leads to decreased selectivity on Cr0.04-SBA-1."
"An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity."
"Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue."
"Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI."
"Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse."
"3.1.2. Vanadium(V)-Based Catalysts"
"VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity."
"Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts."
"Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
"Similar to CrOx, catalytic performance of VOx depends on its structure, dispersion, and interaction with the support."
"Depending on the ratio of metal loading and surface area of support, four types of VOx species are present during reaction, including monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite."
"Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."
"Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."
"V4+ plays an important role in the activation of the secondary CH bond of C3H8 (RDS) by hydrogen abstraction in both CO2ODHP and DHP routes."
"Yet the regeneration of active V sites differs, in which V3+ can be reoxidized through the dissociative CO2 adsorption, while the regeneration in DHP follows the path of hydrogen migration from the bridge oxygen to V3+ hydrogen migration from the vanadyl oxygen (V5+OH) to bridge oxygen desorption of H2."
"Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst."
"Mesoporous silica has been introduced as support to prepare VOx catalysts with high dispersion."
"However, these materials have long, isolated channels and inefficient mass transfer, leading to low catalytic activity."
"Therefore, mesoporous materials with short-range, ordered mesopores with highly dispersed VOx species are desired."
"Xue et al. have prepared homogeneous, monodispersed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) and used them as support for VOx catalysts."
"The catalysts have been prepared via an oilwater biphase stratification reaction system that allows the delicate control of monolayer coverage and prohibit agglomeration of V species to V2O5."
"The as-prepared catalyst displays higher C3H6 selectivity and comparable C3H8 conversion in comparison to other catalysts in Table 4."
"Both conversion and selectivity can be completely recovered after simple reoxidation in air."

The primary causes of deactivation in Cr-based catalysts are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. Reoxidation is effective in reversing coke deposition, while CO2 can help inhibit coking or remove coke in situ. High-temperature regeneration in air or CO2 is commonly applied, restoring most of the activity and selectivity. Oxygen at 600°C can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with repeatability observed after several cycles. Using CO2 as an oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, failing to prevent further deactivation thereafter. Adding oxygen during CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation can promote coke removal but negatively impacts C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. A complete recovery of active sites is challenging but possible with well-dispersed Cr species. For VOx-based catalysts, overoxidation hinders achieving high C3H6 selectivity. CO2 addition in the feed gas helps reduce surface molecular oxygen species, neutralizing sites prone to overoxidation. Catalytic performance of VOx depends on its structure, dispersion, and interaction with the support. Four types of VOx species exist: monovanadate, oligomeric vanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite. Isothermal reduction shows that CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 but cannot completely reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5. Alternative redox cycles, such as the V5+ V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst, have been identified. Mesoporous silica supports have been used for VOx catalysts but result in low activity due to long, isolated channels. To address this, Xue et al. developed 3D dendritic mesoporous silica nanospheres (3D dendritic MSNSs) as a support, enabling higher C3H6 selectivity and comparable C3H8 conversion. These catalysts can be fully recovered after simple reoxidation in air.

Cr催化剂失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。通过氧化可以逆转焦炭沉积，而CO2有助于原位去除焦炭或抑制焦炭生成过程。高温下在空气中或CO2中再生通常可以恢复大部分活性和选择性。在600°C的氧气中进行5分钟的再生可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，并且在多次循环后保持可重复性。使用CO2作为氧化剂只能在第二轮循环中实现完全恢复，之后无法防止催化剂进一步失活。在CO2氧化脱氢过程中添加氧气可以促进焦炭的去除，但会伴随C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的大幅下降。通过适当的方法制备分散良好的Cr物种，可以获得完全恢复活性位点的可能性。对于VOx基催化剂，过氧化会阻碍实现高C3H6选择性。通过在C3H8/O2的进料气体中添加CO2，可以调整基本氧化位点上的吸附-脱附平衡，减少表面分子氧物种，从而降低过氧化的影响。催化性能取决于VOx的结构、分散性和与支持物的相互作用。反应期间存在四种类型的VOx物种：单钒酸盐、寡聚钒酸盐、多聚钒酸盐和V2O5晶粒。等温还原结果显示，CO2不能完全将催化剂重新氧化为V2O5，但可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4。提出了包含CO2ODHP、DHP和RWGS的整个反应网络中硅氧烷簇中孤立的V5+OV3+对的密度泛函理论（DFT）计算所提出的红ox机制。V4+在CO2ODHP和DHP途径中都扮演着激活C3H8（RDS）中次级CH键的关键角色。然而，活性V位点的再生方式不同：V3+可以通过解离CO2吸附进行氧化，而在DHP中，则是通过桥氧到V3+的氢迁移、桥氧到范德华氧（V5+OH）的氢迁移以及H2的脱附。值得注意的是，已知存在另一种红ox循环，如氧化金刚石支持的VOx催化剂上的V5+ V4+循环。对于以二氧化硅多孔材料为载体的VOx催化剂，尽管其具有长而孤立的通道和低的传质效率，导致催化活性较低。因此，需要短程有序的多孔结构和高度分散的VOx物种。Xue等人通过油水两相分层反应系统制备了均匀、单分散的三维树状多孔二氧化硅纳米球（3D树状MSNSs），并将其用作VOx催化剂的支撑。这种催化剂能够通过简单的空气氧化完全恢复活性和选择性，在与其他催化剂比较时显示更高的C3H6选择性和相当的C3H8转化率。这些催化剂可以在空气中完全恢复活性。
