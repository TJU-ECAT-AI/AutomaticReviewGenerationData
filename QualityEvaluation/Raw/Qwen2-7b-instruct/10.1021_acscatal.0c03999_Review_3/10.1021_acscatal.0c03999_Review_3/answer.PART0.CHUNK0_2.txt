[2] "Regeneration in air or CO2 at high temperatures (i.e., 550-650°C) is widely applied, through which most of the activity and selectivity are usually recoverable."
[3] "For example, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 min can completely restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, and such recovery is repeatable after 4 cycles."
[4] "Differently, using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, beyond which, however, it cannot prevent the catalyst from further deactivation."
[5] "Alternatively, co-feeding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote the removal of coke during the reaction, but it is accompanied by a drastic decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity."
[6] "By contrast, a complete recovery of active sites is rather challenging yet is still achievable if a proper method is used to prepare well-dispersed Cr species."
[7] "From a practical point of view, increasing Cr loading while preserving high dispersion is necessary to attain comparable catalytic performance that meets industrial requirements."
[8] "However, the formation of inactive crystalline α-Cr2O3 is inevitable at higher Cr loadings, the presence of which limits the activity and is also detrimental to stability."

[22] "The unique pore structure and large surface area of mesoporous support materials are effective in confining the growth of Cr species and affecting dispersion and structure of Cr species."
[23] "However, the preservation of pore structure and porosity under reaction conditions is challenging."
[24] "Michorczyk et al. find that the irreversible degradation of the pore structure after multiple cycles leads to decreased selectivity on Cr0.04-SBA-1."
[25] "An option to preserve the unique pore structure is to control the Cr loading at a lower level, however, this sacrifices the activity."
[26] "Choosing proper synthetic methods to prepare catalysts provides solutions to overcome this issue."
[27] "Michorczyk et al. have prepared Cr/SBA-1 catalyst by IWI."
[28] "Compared to the Cr-SBA-1 prepared by direct synthesis method, the pore structure of IWI-prepared catalysts is preserved to a larger degree, significantly alleviating the irreversible deactivation caused by pore collapse."
[29] "VOx is another redox-active metal oxide that has been extensively studied in the O2ODHP reaction, and the overoxidation still impairs the effort to achieve high C3H6 selectivity."
[30] "Early attempts have tried to neutralize the sites for overoxidation on vanadate catalysts."
[31] "Adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2 is a promising approach, as it enables a decrease of surface molecular oxygen species that account for overoxidation by tuning adsorption-desorption equilibria on basic oxidizing sites."
[32] "Results of isothermal reduction confirm that CO2 cannot reoxidize the catalyst completely to V2O5 but is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4."
[33] "Redox mechanisms have been proposed on the silsesquioxane cluster with an isolated V5+OV3+ pair via density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the entire reaction network including CO2ODHP, DHP, and RWGS."
[34] "Of note, alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+  V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are coke deposition and reduction of active sites. For Cr-based catalysts, regeneration methods such as reoxidation in air or CO2 at high temperatures (550-650°C) are widely applied, allowing for the recovery of most of the activity and selectivity. For instance, regeneration in O2 at 600°C for 5 min can fully restore the activity of CrOx/ZrO2, with this recovery being repeatable after 4 cycles. Using CO2 as a regeneration oxidant only allows a complete recovery in the second cycle, and it cannot prevent further deactivation beyond that. Adding O2 in CO2ODHP can promote coke removal during the reaction, but it comes with a significant decrease in C3H6 selectivity and C2C3 olefin selectivity. For VOx catalysts, overoxidation impairs efforts to achieve high C3H6 selectivity, and early attempts have tried to neutralize overoxidation sites by adding CO2 in the feed gas of C3H8/O2, which helps decrease surface molecular oxygen species. Results show that CO2 cannot completely reoxidize the catalyst to V2O5 but can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4. Alternative redox cycles have also been known, such as the V5+  V4+ cycle on an oxidized diamond-supported VOx catalyst.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是焦炭沉积和活性位点的还原。对于Cr基催化剂，采用高温空气或CO2再生（550-650°C）方法广泛应用于恢复大部分活性和选择性。例如，在600°C下用O2再生5分钟可以完全恢复CrOx/ZrO2的活性，且这种恢复在经历4个周期后仍然可重复。使用CO2作为再生氧化剂仅能在第二周期实现完全恢复，之后无法防止催化剂进一步失效。在CO2ODHP过程中添加O2促进焦炭去除，但伴随着C3H6选择性和C2C3烯烃选择性的急剧下降。对于VOx催化剂，过氧化导致努力提高C3H6选择性受阻，早期尝试通过在C3H8/O2进气中添加CO2来中和过氧化位点，这有助于减少表面分子氧物种。结果表明，CO2不能完全将催化剂氧化为V2O5，但可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4。已知的其他还原循环包括在氧化金刚石支持的VOx催化剂上的V5+  V4+ 循环。
