[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[2] "Furthermore, in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small."
[3] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions, maintaining higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species.

The effectiveness of these methods depends on several factors, including the extent of deactivation, the type of catalyst, and the specific reaction conditions. Reoxidation with air typically leads to complete oxidation, potentially causing irreversible damage to the catalyst. In contrast, reoxidation with CO2 or O2 can selectively restore the active species while avoiding overoxidation, thus preserving the catalytic activity.

Temperature requirements also play a crucial role in determining the efficiency of these methods. Higher temperatures facilitate faster regeneration but may lead to further deactivation or degradation of the catalyst. Lower temperatures reduce the risk of damage but may prolong the regeneration process.

The impact on catalytic performance varies depending on the method chosen. Air reoxidation often results in significant loss of activity due to overoxidation. CO2 or O2 reoxidation, however, tends to maintain higher activity levels, especially in VOx-catalyzed reactions, where the maintenance of higher oxidation states is crucial for efficient dehydrogenation.

In conclusion, CO2 addition during the regeneration process can be an effective strategy to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. This approach helps maintain the higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species, leading to enhanced catalytic performance and prolonged catalyst life.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂（特别是Cr基和VOx催化剂）失效的主要原因包括过氧化。不同的再生方法，如空气、CO2或O2的再氧化，在其有效性、温度要求和对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。在VOx催化反应中添加CO2可以减轻过氧化作用，维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化状态。

这些方法的有效性取决于多个因素，包括脱活的程度、催化剂的类型以及特定反应条件。使用空气进行再氧化通常会导致活性损失，主要是由于过氧化。相比之下，使用CO2或O2进行再氧化能够选择性地恢复活性物种，避免过氧化，从而保持催化活性。

温度要求在确定这些方法效率方面也起着关键作用。较高的温度可以加快再生过程，但可能会导致催化剂进一步损坏或降解。较低的温度降低了损害的风险，但可能延长了再生过程的时间。

催化性能的影响因所选方法而异。使用空气进行再氧化往往会导致显著的活性损失，主要是由于过氧化。而在VOx催化反应中，通过CO2或O2再氧化则倾向于保持较高的活性水平，尤其是对于需要维持较高氧化状态才能有效进行脱氢的反应。

综上所述，在再生过程中添加CO2可以作为减轻VOx催化反应中过氧化作用的有效策略。这种方法有助于维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化状态，从而增强催化性能并延长催化剂寿命。
