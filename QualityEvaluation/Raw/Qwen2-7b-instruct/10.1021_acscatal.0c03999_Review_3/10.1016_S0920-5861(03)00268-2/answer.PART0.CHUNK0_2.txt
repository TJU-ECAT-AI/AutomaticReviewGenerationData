[1] "Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2. A support effect of oxidized diamond for Cr2O3- and V2O5-loaded catalysts was observed in the presence of CO2. Propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst were increased with increasing reaction temperature."
[2] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in terms of effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. As for the comparison, the document does not provide specific details on the effectiveness, temperature requirements, or impact on catalytic performance of these methods. However, it suggests that CO2 might help maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species, thus influencing the catalyst's performance.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因是过氧化。针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，不同的再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2的氧化）在有效性和温度要求以及对催化性能的影响方面存在差异。CO2的添加可以减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化。然而，文档没有提供这些方法的具体有效性、温度要求或对催化性能影响的详细比较。但推测CO2可能有助于维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化状态，从而影响催化剂的性能。
