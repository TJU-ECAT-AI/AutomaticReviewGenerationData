[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[2] "Furthermore, in the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small."
[3] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

1. The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, involve overoxidation. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, differ in their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance. The addition of CO2 can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.

2. In the presence of CO2, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibit a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane. This effect leads to an increase in butane conversion and butene yields, although the promotion is minor compared to the effects seen in propane dehydrogenation.

3. CO2 maintains the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a slightly higher oxidation state than in its absence. This observation suggests that CO2 plays a role in preserving the catalytically active oxidation state of these metal oxides.

4. Maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species in the presence of CO2 is crucial for achieving high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. This state enables the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst to produce high catalytic activities.

1. 金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因涉及过度氧化。针对Cr基和VOx催化剂，不同再生方法（如空气、CO2或O2再氧化）在效率、温度要求和催化性能影响方面存在差异。CO2的添加有助于减轻VOx催化反应中的过度氧化。

2. 在CO2的存在下，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂对丁烷和异丁烷的脱氢表现出促进作用。这种效果导致丁烷转化率和丁二烯产率增加，尽管相对于丙烷脱氢的效应较小。

3. CO2使表面V2O5和Cr2O3保持略高于无CO2状态的氧化态。这一观察表明，CO2在维持这些金属氧化物的催化活性氧化态方面发挥作用。

4. 维持铬和钒物种在CO2存在的更高氧化态对于实现烷烃脱氢过程中的高催化活性至关重要。这种状态使氧化金刚石支持的V2O5催化剂能够产生高催化活性。
