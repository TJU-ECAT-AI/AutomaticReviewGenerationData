[1] "Oxidized diamond demonstrated excellent support for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes to alkenes in the presence of CO2."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 afforded nearly twofold higher activities than that in the absence of CO2."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small."
[4] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[5] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

In the context of dehydrogenation processes involving light alkanes and CO2, the literature highlights that the presence of CO2 significantly enhances the catalytic activity of oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. Specifically, these catalysts exhibit a notable increase in activity when dehydrogenating propane in the presence of CO2, achieving nearly double the efficiency compared to when CO2 is absent. Additionally, the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane also shows a small but noticeable promotion effect from CO2, albeit with a lesser magnitude. UV-Vis analysis further supports the role of CO2 in maintaining a higher oxidation state of the surface Cr2O3 and V2O5 species, thereby contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance under CO2 conditions. The underlying mechanism suggests that CO2 may stabilize the oxidation state of the catalysts, facilitating more efficient dehydrogenation reactions.

在涉及轻烷烃和CO2的脱氢过程中，文献表明CO2的存在显著提高了氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂的催化活性。具体而言，在CO2存在的条件下进行丙烷脱氢时，这些催化剂的活性几乎比没有CO2时高两倍。此外，n-丁烷和异丁烷的脱氢也显示出CO2对转化率和丁二烯产率的小幅但可观察到的促进作用，尽管这种促进作用较小。UV-Vis分析进一步证实了CO2在维持表面Cr2O3和V2O5物种的较高氧化状态中的作用，从而促进了在CO2条件下的增强催化性能。背后的机制表明，CO2可能稳定了催化剂的氧化状态，从而促进了更高效的脱氢反应。
