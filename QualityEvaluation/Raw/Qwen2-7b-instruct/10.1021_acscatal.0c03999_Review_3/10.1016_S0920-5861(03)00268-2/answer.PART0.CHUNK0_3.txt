[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation of n-butane and iso-butane, a promoting effect of CO2 on butane conversion and butenes yields was observed over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, though the promotion effect was small."
[3] "UV-Vis analyses of the fresh and the reacted catalysts in the presence and absence of CO2 revealed that CO2 kept the surface V2O5 and Cr2O3 in a state of oxidation slightly higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "Propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst were increased with increasing reaction temperature."
[5] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation, which can lead to the loss of active sites and reduced catalytic performance. Various regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, aim to restore the catalysts' activity. Among these, CO2 addition shows promise in mitigating overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions. The effectiveness of these methods varies depending on the specific catalyst, the extent of deactivation, and the reaction conditions. Higher temperatures generally facilitate the reoxidation process, but they can also lead to the formation of coke precursors, which deactivate the catalysts. The role of CO2 in maintaining the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species in the presence of CO2 is crucial for high catalytic activities in dehydrogenation processes.

金属氧化物催化剂在氧化脱氢过程中失效的主要原因包括过氧化，这会导致活性位点丢失和催化性能降低。针对Cr基和VOx催化剂的各种再生方法旨在恢复催化剂活性。其中，CO2添加在减轻VOx催化反应中的过氧化方面显示出潜力。这些方法的有效性取决于具体催化剂、失活程度以及反应条件。更高的温度有助于促进再生过程，但也会导致焦炭前体的形成，从而使催化剂失活。在CO2存在的条件下维持铬和钒物种的更高氧化状态对烷烃脱氢过程中的高催化活性至关重要。
