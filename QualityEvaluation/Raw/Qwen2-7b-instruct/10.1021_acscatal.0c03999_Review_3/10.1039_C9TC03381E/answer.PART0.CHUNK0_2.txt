Metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, particularly focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, is caused by multiple factors including poisoning, sintering, and overoxidation. The regeneration methods, such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2, vary in terms of their effectiveness, temperature requirements, and impact on catalytic performance.

Reoxidation with air is generally effective but requires high temperatures, which can lead to sintering and loss of catalyst activity. CO2 regeneration can mitigate overoxidation, as CO2 can act as a reducing agent, but it may not be as effective in removing all deactivating species. Oxygen regeneration can also help in reactivating the catalyst, but it might lead to further overoxidation if not controlled.

Each method needs to be carefully optimized for the specific catalyst and reaction conditions to balance effectiveness and minimal degradation of catalytic performance.

在氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂的失效主要由中毒、烧结和过氧化等因素引起。再生方法，如用空气、CO2或O2重新氧化，其效果、所需温度以及对催化性能的影响各不相同。

用空气再生通常有效，但需要较高的温度，这可能导致烧结和催化剂活性损失。CO2再生可以减轻过氧化，因为CO2可以作为还原剂使用，但它可能无法去除所有致活物种。氧气再生也可以帮助恢复催化剂活性，但如果控制不当，它可能会导致进一步的过氧化。

每种方法都需要针对特定的催化剂和反应条件进行仔细优化，以平衡效果和最小化催化性能的降解。
