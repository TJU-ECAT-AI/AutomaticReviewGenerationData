[1] "Initial experiments on photocurrent generation using either doped or undoped diamond films were performed by irradiating the surface with monochromatic laser light of various intensities.210, 211 By employing above bandgap light (>5.5 eV), cathodic photocurrents of a few A/cm2 were obtained."
[2] "The hole diffusion coefficient (230 cm2s-1)227 and optical transparency in the region between 300 and 1000 nm compare favorable to NiO, which is currently being employed as photocathode."
[3] "Good energy level alignment of the valence band of diamond with the valence band of CdTe provided sufficient driving force for charge separation."
[4] "The working principle of a p-type DSSC is illustrated in Figure 13. Under illumination, an electron is promoted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leaving behind a positively charged hole in the ground state."

1. Initial experiments demonstrated that irradiating diamond films with above bandgap light resulted in cathodic photocurrents of a few A/cm2.
2. The hole diffusion coefficient of diamond films was found to be 230 cm2s-1, which compares favorably to NiO, a commonly used photocathode.
3. Effective charge separation in p-type dye-sensitized solar cells was facilitated by a good alignment of the valence bands of diamond and the valence band of the semiconductor material, such as CdTe.
4. The working principle of a p-type dye-sensitized solar cell involves the promotion of electrons from the dye's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the dye's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leaving behind a positively charged hole.

1. 初始实验表明，通过使用高于带隙光照射钻石薄膜，可以获得几A/cm2的阴极光电流。
2. 钻石薄膜的空穴扩散系数为230 cm2s-1，与目前使用的光阳极NiO相比，这一数值具有优势。
3. 钻石的价带与半导体材料CdTe的价带良好的对齐为电荷分离提供了足够的驱动力。
4. p型染料敏化太阳能电池的工作原理涉及将染料的最高占据分子轨道（HOMO）中的电子提升至染料的最低未占据分子轨道（LUMO），从而留下一个正电荷的空穴。
