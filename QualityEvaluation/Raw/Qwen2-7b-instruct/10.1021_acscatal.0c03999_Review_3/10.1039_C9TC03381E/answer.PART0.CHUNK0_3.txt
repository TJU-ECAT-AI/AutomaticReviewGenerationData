[1] "Initial experiments on photocurrent generation using either doped or undoped diamond films were performed by irradiating the surface with monochromatic laser light of various intensities."
[2] "Since the a-C:H film has a lower bandgap (between 0.8 and 3.0 eV) than diamond, this layer mainly absorbs visible light, whereas diamond absorbs the UV light."
[3] "In another application, diamond films were deposited on industrial silicon solar cells, which contributed to the stability of the devices under earth- and space-like illumination conditions (AM 1.0 and AM 0, respectively)."
[4] "The working principle of a p-type dye-sensitized solar cells is illustrated in Figure 13. Under illumination, an electron is promoted from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the dye to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leaving behind a positively charged hole in the ground state."
[5] "An explanation for this observation was found in the thickness of the space charge layer. In case of the more highly doped diamond, the strongly decreased size of this space charge layer hindered effective charge separation."
[6] "The HOMO of surface attached Ru(tpy)2 was found to be 0.9 eV below the VBM of diamond. This large energy difference will surely result in a fast hole injection and regeneration of the dye."

1. Initial experiments involved irradiating diamond films with laser light of varying intensities to generate photocurrents. 
2. The amorphous carbon film absorbs visible light due to its lower bandgap, while diamond absorbs UV light.
3. Diamond films improved the stability of solar cells under both Earth-like and space-like illumination conditions.
4. The working mechanism of p-type dye-sensitized solar cells involves electron promotion from dye's HOMO to the dye's LUMO upon illumination, leaving a positively charged hole.
5. The thickness of the space charge layer influenced effective charge separation, with highly doped diamond hindering it.
6. The Ru(tpy)2 dye attached to the diamond had its HOMO 0.9 eV below the diamond's VBM, facilitating rapid hole injection and dye regeneration.
