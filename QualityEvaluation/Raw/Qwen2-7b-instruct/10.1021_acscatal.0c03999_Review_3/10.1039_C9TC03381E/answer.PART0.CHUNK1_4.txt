[1] "By employing diamond as a source of solvated electrons, the issue of adsorbing N2 is circumvented and high-energy intermediates become more readily accessible."
[2] "Upon illumination of H-terminated diamond surfaces with UV light (hν > 5.5 eV), the electrons that are excited from the valence band to the conduction band can readily be ejected into vacuum or in a liquid in a barrier-free fashion."
[3] "These solvated electrons are extremely useful as they can be employed as strong reducing agents (ca. -4.6 V vs NHE) in chemical reactions that are not accessible through conventional methods."
[4] "When operating at neutral pH values, all primary amino (C-NH2) groups at the diamond surface should be protonated, creating a positively charged layer, resulting in a NEA."
[5] "As-prepared NH2-terminated diamond electrodes showed a similar efficiency in reducing N2 compared to a H-terminated surface. However, after briefly submerging the samples in concentrated HCl, an almost 2-fold increase in efficiency was observed."
[6] "A combination of experimental and theoretical studies has revealed that the reduction of N2 to ammonia in an aqueous solution proceeds via a single mechanism."
[7] "In this way, dyes with a complementary absorption spectra can be attached."

1. By utilizing diamond as a source of solvated electrons, the challenge of adsorbing N2 is bypassed, allowing for easier access to high-energy intermediates.

2. Upon exposure of H-terminated diamond surfaces to UV light (hν > 5.5 eV), electrons are efficiently ejected from the valence band to the conduction band without hindrance.

3. Solvated electrons, with a strong reductive capacity of around -4.6 V vs NHE, are invaluable for chemical reactions that are otherwise inaccessible via traditional methods.

4. At neutral pH levels, all primary amino (C-NH2) groups on the diamond surface should be protonated, forming a positively charged layer that leads to a negative electron affinity (NEA).

5. Following brief immersion in concentrated HCl, NH2-terminated diamond electrodes experienced a nearly 2-fold increase in efficiency in reducing N2, compared to H-terminated surfaces.

6. Studies combining experimental data and theoretical models have confirmed that the reduction of N2 to ammonia in an aqueous environment follows a single pathway.

7. By attaching dyes with complementary absorption spectra, the potential for diverse functionalities and applications on the diamond surface is expanded.

8. The development of biosensors that can detect multiple target molecules showcases the versatility of functionalized diamond substrates in analytical applications.

1. 利用钻石作为自由电子源，可以避免吸附N2的问题，并使高能中间体更容易获得。

2. 当H-终止的钻石表面受到UV光（hν > 5.5 eV）照射时，从价带到导带的电子可以无障碍地被射出到真空或液体中。

3. 这些自由电子具有约-4.6 V vs NHE的强还原能力，对于通过传统方法无法访问的化学反应非常有价值。

4. 在中性pH值下，钻石表面的所有主要氨基（C-NH2）组都应该被质子化，形成一个正电荷层，导致负电子亲和力（NEA）。

5. 短暂浸入浓盐酸后，NH2-终止的钻石电极在减少N2方面的效率几乎提高了2倍，与H-终止的表面相比。

6. 结合实验数据和理论模型的研究证实，在水中，N2还原为氨遵循单一途径。

7. 通过附着具有互补吸收谱的染料，钻石表面的功能性和应用潜力得到了扩展。

8. 可以检测多种目标分子的生物传感器的开发展示了功能化钻石基板在分析应用中的多功能性。
