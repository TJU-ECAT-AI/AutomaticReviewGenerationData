[1] "The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are poisoning, sintering, and overoxidation."
[2] "Regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can be effective in restoring catalyst activity, but the choice depends on the specific catalyst and reaction conditions."
[3] "Temperature requirements for effective regeneration vary, with air and O2 often requiring higher temperatures than CO2."
[4] "CO2 addition can mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing an alternative pathway for oxygen removal, thus preserving catalyst performance."

The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes are poisoning, sintering, and overoxidation. Regeneration methods like reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 can restore catalyst activity, though the effectiveness varies depending on the catalyst and conditions. Air and O2 usually require higher temperatures for regeneration compared to CO2. CO2 addition helps mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions by providing an alternative oxygen removal pathway, thus preserving catalyst performance.

氧化脱氢过程中，金属氧化物催化剂失效的主要原因包括中毒、烧结和过氧化。再生方法如通过空气、二氧化碳或氧气重新氧化可以恢复催化剂活性，但其有效性取决于催化剂和条件。空气和氧气通常需要更高的温度进行再生，而二氧化碳则不同。通过提供一个替代的氧去除途径，二氧化碳的添加有助于缓解VOx催化反应中的过氧化作用，从而保持催化剂性能。
