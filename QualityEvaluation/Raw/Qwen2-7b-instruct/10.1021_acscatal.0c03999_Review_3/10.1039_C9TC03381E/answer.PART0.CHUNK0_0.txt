[1] "Metal oxide catalysts, particularly those based on chromium (Cr) and vanadium oxide (VOx), experience deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes."
[2] "Regeneration methods for these catalysts include reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2."
[3] "CO2 addition has been explored as a means to mitigate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The primary causes of metal oxide catalyst deactivation in oxidative dehydrogenation processes, focusing on Cr-based and VOx catalysts, include overoxidation. Various regeneration methods such as reoxidation with air, CO2, or O2 are employed to restore the catalyst's performance. Among these, CO2 addition is investigated as a strategy to alleviate overoxidation in VOx-catalyzed reactions.
