<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>The model was developed through studies of a number of Pt alloys. The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site.</p>
<p>The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states.</p>
<p>The picture that emerges from these studies is that when two transition metals are brought together to form an alloy, the change in the position of the local d-band center (and therefore the local chemical reactivity) is to a large degree governed only by the width of the localized d-band, which is a unique function of the alloy geometry (the bond distance between the alloy atoms) and the spatial extent of d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy.</p>

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by affecting the width of the local density of d-states, which correlates with the chemical reactivity of the sites in the alloys. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, allowing the width of the d-band to serve as a universal descriptor of the local chemical reactivity. By understanding how the bond distance and the spatial extent of d-orbitals in alloys impact the d-band width, one can predict the chemical reactivity of specific sites in alloys and design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts.

几何和电子效应在过渡金属合金中协同影响催化性能，通过影响局部密度的d状态宽度，这与合金中位点的化学活性相关。合金中d轨道的杂化不会导致构成元素之间显著的电荷转移，允许d带宽度作为描述局部化学活性的通用指标。通过理解合金中元素间的键长和d轨道的空间范围如何影响d带宽度，可以预测特定位点在合金中的化学活性，并设计出更高效、选择性更强且可调的催化系统，这些系统在性能上超过传统的单金属催化剂。
