[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
[2] "We define the chemical reactivity of a site by the strength of the interaction, i.e. the binding energy, of common adsorbates (O, C, OH, CO, CHx, etc.) with the site."
[3] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
[4] "For a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
[5] "These relationships were also recognized in recent contributions of Kitchin et al. where DFT calculations were used to analyze a large number of alloys."

To address the synergy between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys for catalytic performance, it is crucial to understand how the structure of alloys influences their chemical reactivity. By studying the electronic structure, particularly focusing on the d-band properties, researchers can predict the impact of alloying on the local chemical reactivity of sites within the alloys. The key insight here is that the hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not significantly alter the charge distribution between constituent elements. Instead, the width of the d-band, which is influenced by the spatial extent of the d-orbitals, becomes a crucial factor determining the chemical reactivity of sites. This allows for the prediction of catalytic performance based on alloy composition, as the width of the d-band is a unique function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extents of the orbitals of the metal atoms involved. By leveraging Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, it is possible to analyze the electronic structure of a wide range of alloys, thus enabling the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts in performance.

为了探讨合金结构与催化性能之间的协同效应，理解合金结构如何影响其化学活性至关重要。通过研究电子结构，特别是聚焦于d带性质，研究人员可以预测合金化对合金中位点化学活性的影响。关键见解是，在合金中，d轨道的杂化不会显著改变构成元素之间的电荷分布。相反，d带的宽度，受参与合金的金属原子轨道空间范围的影响，成为决定位点化学活性的关键因素。这使得根据合金组成预测催化性能成为可能，因为d带宽度是合金几何形状和参与金属原子轨道空间范围的独特函数。通过使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，可以分析大量合金的电子结构，从而促进设计更高效、选择性和可调的催化系统，这些系统的性能超过传统的单金属催化剂。
