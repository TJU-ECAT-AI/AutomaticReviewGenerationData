<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>The significance of the d-band model is that for pure monatomic metals it has a predictive capacity, and it has been used to understand (predict) the relative chemical activity of transition and noble metals.</p>
<p>For example, various adsorbates important in many catalytic processes, such as O, C, OH, CO, and CHx fragments, interact with the d-states of metals via the formation of bonding and anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states (orbitals).</p>
<p>Similarly, for a given shape (width) of the d-band, the position of the center of d-band is governed by the filling of the band where metals with a lower d-band filling have an energetically higher center of d-band.</p>
<p>Since the distance between Pt and the 3d metals in the 3d-M/Pt skin alloys is approximately equal for the different alloys, this is reasonable since the geometry is to a large degree governed by the s/p states, which are in the case of 3d metals very similar to each other.</p>
<p>The advantage of establishing relationships between the adsorption energies and the spatial extent of d-orbitals (r<sup>3/2</sup><sub>dm</sub>) is that the values of r<sup>3/2</sup><sub>dm</sub> are unique properties of pure metals and are often tabulated or can be computed easily.</p>

The document discusses how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can influence catalytic performance. Specifically, it explains that while predicting the reactivity of pure metals is relatively straightforward, understanding the performance of alloys presents more challenges. The document highlights the role of the d-band model in predicting the reactivity of pure metals and suggests that for alloys, the width of the local d-band is crucial. It also mentions that for a fixed site geometry, the width of the d-band and its center, thus influencing the chemical reactivity, is a unique function of the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms forming the alloy. The spatial extent of d-orbitals is easier to determine and correlates well with the adsorption energies of various adsorbates on alloy surfaces.

文档讨论了过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应如何影响催化性能。特别指出，虽然预测纯金属的活性相对简单，但理解合金的性能则提出了更多挑战。文档强调了d带模型在预测纯金属活性中的作用，并指出对于合金而言，局部d带的宽度至关重要。它还提到，在固定位点几何结构的情况下，带中心及其宽度（从而影响化学活性）是金属原子形成合金时d轨道空间范围的独特功能。d轨道的空间范围更容易确定并与合金表面各种吸附剂的吸附能相关。
