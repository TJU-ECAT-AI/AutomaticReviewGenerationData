<p>While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging.</p>
<p>Alloys are an important class of materials that often exhibit unique physical and chemical characteristics, such as exceptional hardness [1] or superior chemical reactivity [2].</p>
<p>The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center.</p>
<p>The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states.</p>
<p>Since the d-band width is a unique function of the alloy geometry, more specifically the bond distance between the elements in the alloy, and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy, both of which are easily accessible, the width can be easily estimated and therefore the chemical reactivity of a particular site in an alloy can be predicted.</p>
