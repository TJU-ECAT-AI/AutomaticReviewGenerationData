[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
[2] "For example, various adsorbates important in many catalytic processes, such as O, C, OH, CO, and CHx fragments, interact with the d-states of metals via the formation of bonding and anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states (orbitals)."
[3] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
[4] "The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center."
[5] "For example, for metals in a column in the periodic table of elements, the d-band filling is identical (same number of d electrons), while the spatial extent of d-orbitals increases from top to bottom of the column."
[6] "Similarly, for a given shape (width) of the d-band, the position of the center of d-band is governed by the filling of the band where metals with a lower d-band filling have an energetically higher center of d-band."
[7] "Our findings are contrasted against previously proposed models."
[8] "This is illustrated in our DFT calculations shown in Fig. 1b where we plotted adsorption energy for various adsorbates on 3d-M/Pt skin model alloys as a function of the calculated center of the d-band projected on the surface Pt atoms."
[9] "For example, our analysis using the Newns-Anderson (N-A) model of chemisorption to isolate and quantify the impact of the changes in the filling of a broad substrate band (s/p-like) on the interaction of the substrate with an adsorbate single state showed that for changes in the band filling of 0.2 electrons, there was no significant change in the interaction energy (<0.1 eV)."

To design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems, one must leverage the synergistic effects of geometric and electronic changes in transition-metal alloys. By understanding how the width of the localized d-band, influenced by both the geometry and electronic structure of the alloy, affects the chemical reactivity of its sites, researchers can predict and tailor catalytic performance. This involves recognizing that the d-band width, which is a unique function of the alloy's bond distance and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms, can be easily estimated. Strategies can then be developed to optimize the d-band properties, enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity beyond traditional monometallic catalysts. For instance, the position of the d-band center and its impact on adsorbate interactions can guide the design of alloys with desired catalytic properties. Additionally, employing models like the Newns-Anderson (N-A) model helps isolate and quantify the effects of changes in the electronic structure on catalytic performance, enabling more precise control over the catalytic behavior of alloys.

为了设计更高效、选择性更强且可调的催化系统，必须利用过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的协同作用。通过理解合金中局部d带宽度的变化如何影响其位点的化学活性，研究者可以预测并定制催化性能。这涉及到认识到局部d带宽度是合金键长和金属原子中d轨道空间扩展的独特函数，可以很容易地估算。然后可以开发策略来优化d带属性，增强催化活性和选择性，超越传统的单金属催化剂。例如，d带中心的位置及其对吸附剂相互作用的影响可以指导合金设计，以获得所需的催化性质。此外，使用如Newns-Anderson（N-A）模型等模型有助于隔离和量化电子结构变化对催化性能的影响，从而实现对合金催化行为的更精确控制。
