[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
[2] "We define the chemical reactivity of a site by the strength of the interaction, i.e. the binding energy, of common adsorbates (O, C, OH, CO, CHx, etc.) with the site."
[3] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
[4] "For a fixed site geometry (i.e. the distance between atoms and the number of atoms that form the site), the width of the d-band localized on the site, and therefore the d-band center and the local chemical reactivity, is a unique function of only the spatial extents of the orbitals of the atoms that form the site."
[5] "These relationships were also recognized in recent contributions of Kitchin et al. where DFT calculations were used to analyze a large number of alloys."

To address the synergy between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys for catalytic performance, it is crucial to understand how the structure of alloys influences their chemical reactivity. By studying the electronic structure, particularly focusing on the d-band properties, researchers can predict the impact of alloying on the local chemical reactivity of sites within the alloys. The key insight here is that the hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not significantly alter the charge distribution between constituent elements. Instead, the width of the d-band, which is influenced by the spatial extent of the d-orbitals, becomes a crucial factor determining the chemical reactivity of sites. This allows for the prediction of catalytic performance based on alloy composition, as the width of the d-band is a unique function of the alloy geometry and the spatial extents of the orbitals of the metal atoms involved. By leveraging Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, it is possible to analyze the electronic structure of a wide range of alloys, thus enabling the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts in performance.

为了探讨合金结构与催化性能之间的协同效应，理解合金结构如何影响其化学活性至关重要。通过研究电子结构，特别是聚焦于d带性质，研究人员可以预测合金化对合金中位点化学活性的影响。关键见解是，在合金中，d轨道的杂化不会显著改变构成元素之间的电荷分布。相反，d带的宽度，受参与合金的金属原子轨道空间范围的影响，成为决定位点化学活性的关键因素。这使得根据合金组成预测催化性能成为可能，因为d带宽度是合金几何形状和参与金属原子轨道空间范围的独特函数。通过使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，可以分析大量合金的电子结构，从而促进设计更高效、选择性和可调的催化系统，这些系统的性能超过传统的单金属催化剂。

[1] "While it is fairly straightforward to predict the relative chemical reactivity of pure metals, obtaining similar structure-performance relationships for alloys is more challenging."
[2] "For example, various adsorbates important in many catalytic processes, such as O, C, OH, CO, and CHx fragments, interact with the d-states of metals via the formation of bonding and anti-bonding metal-adsorbate states (orbitals)."
[3] "The central feature of the model is that hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements in the alloy, and therefore the width of the local density of d-states projected on a site, which is easily calculated from tabulated parameters, is an excellent descriptor of the chemical reactivity of the site."
[4] "The position of the bonding and anti-bonding orbitals with respect to the Fermi level depends on the position of the metal d-band center."
[5] "For example, for metals in a column in the periodic table of elements, the d-band filling is identical (same number of d electrons), while the spatial extent of d-orbitals increases from top to bottom of the column."
[6] "Similarly, for a given shape (width) of the d-band, the position of the center of d-band is governed by the filling of the band where metals with a lower d-band filling have an energetically higher center of d-band."
[7] "Our findings are contrasted against previously proposed models."
[8] "This is illustrated in our DFT calculations shown in Fig. 1b where we plotted adsorption energy for various adsorbates on 3d-M/Pt skin model alloys as a function of the calculated center of the d-band projected on the surface Pt atoms."
[9] "For example, our analysis using the Newns-Anderson (N-A) model of chemisorption to isolate and quantify the impact of the changes in the filling of a broad substrate band (s/p-like) on the interaction of the substrate with an adsorbate single state showed that for changes in the band filling of 0.2 electrons, there was no significant change in the interaction energy (<0.1 eV)."

To design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems, one must leverage the synergistic effects of geometric and electronic changes in transition-metal alloys. By understanding how the width of the localized d-band, influenced by both the geometry and electronic structure of the alloy, affects the chemical reactivity of its sites, researchers can predict and tailor catalytic performance. This involves recognizing that the d-band width, which is a unique function of the alloy's bond distance and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms, can be easily estimated. Strategies can then be developed to optimize the d-band properties, enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity beyond traditional monometallic catalysts. For instance, the position of the d-band center and its impact on adsorbate interactions can guide the design of alloys with desired catalytic properties. Additionally, employing models like the Newns-Anderson (N-A) model helps isolate and quantify the effects of changes in the electronic structure on catalytic performance, enabling more precise control over the catalytic behavior of alloys.

<p>Alloys are an important class of materials that often exhibit unique physical and chemical characteristics, such as exceptional hardness [1] or superior chemical reactivity [2].</p>
<p>The main difference between pure metals and alloys is that in alloys additional factors such as the transfer of electronic charge from one element to another, i.e., alloy-specific changes in the local d-band filling might, in addition to the overlap between d-orbitals, affect the position of the d-band center.</p>
<p>The analysis of the measured Pt L3 XANES spectra showed that: (i) the measured spectra is a good representation of the ground state d-DOS above the Fermi level projected on Pt atoms, (ii) the formation of Pt alloys results in a change in the width (the spread around the Fermi level) of the d-band localized on Pt due to the hybridization between the Pt d states and the valence states of guest elements in the Pt alloys, and (iii) there is no significant charge transfer to or from the Pt d states.</p>
<p>Since the d-band width is a unique function of the alloy geometry, more specifically the bond distance between the elements in the alloy, and the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms that form the alloy, both of which are easily accessible, the width can be easily estimated and therefore the chemical reactivity of a particular site in an alloy can be predicted.</p>

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by affecting the width of the local density of d-states, which correlates with the chemical reactivity of the sites in the alloys. The hybridization of d-orbitals in alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent elements, allowing the width of the d-band to serve as a universal descriptor of the local chemical reactivity. By understanding how the bond distance and the spatial extent of d-orbitals in alloys impact the d-band width, one can predict the chemical reactivity of specific sites in alloys and design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts.

The document discusses how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can influence catalytic performance. Specifically, it explains that while predicting the reactivity of pure metals is relatively straightforward, understanding the performance of alloys presents more challenges. The document highlights the role of the d-band model in predicting the reactivity of pure metals and suggests that for alloys, the width of the local d-band is crucial. It also mentions that for a fixed site geometry, the width of the d-band and its center, thus influencing the chemical reactivity, is a unique function of the spatial extent of the d-orbitals of the metal atoms forming the alloy. The spatial extent of d-orbitals is easier to determine and correlates well with the adsorption energies of various adsorbates on alloy surfaces.
