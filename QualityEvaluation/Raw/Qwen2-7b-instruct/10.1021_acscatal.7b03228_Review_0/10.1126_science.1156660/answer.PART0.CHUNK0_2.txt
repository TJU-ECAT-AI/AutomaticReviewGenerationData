[1] "Felix Studt Hydrogenation of Acetylene Identification of Non-Precious Metal Alloy Catalysts for Selective"
[2] "However, if the HST distance is correct and the accretion rate is indeed as high as 107 Myear1, we have to assume an accretion rate during the rise of 5 × 108 M yr1."
[3] "The detection of a jet in a DN with similar disc/jet coupling as that seen in XRBs suggests that there may be a common jet-launching mechanism in CVs and XRBs."

The document does not directly address the question regarding how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance nor the innovative strategies to exploit this interplay. It focuses on the hydrogenation of acetylene and the identification of non-precious metal alloy catalysts for selective processes. However, it discusses the possibility of a common jet-launching mechanism between CVs (Cataclysmic Variables) and XRBs (X-ray Binaries), suggesting similarities in the radio luminosity and the relationship between radio emission and accretion states.

文献没有直接回答关于过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能的问题，以及利用这种相互作用开发更高效、选择性和可调的催化系统的创新策略。它关注于乙炔的氢化和非贵金属合金催化剂的选择性过程的识别。然而，它讨论了CV（恒星变光）和XRB（X射线双星）之间可能存在一个共同的喷流发射机制的可能性，表明了无线电亮度的相似性和射电发射与吸积状态之间的关系。
