[1] "The present paper demonstrates that the modifications in d-band characteristics due to the combined effect of electronic and geometric contributions from different surface structures and alloying can be estimated using the correlations between the d-band widths and the interatomic matrix elements."
[2] "A tight-binding model parameterised by a database of density functional theory calculations is presented and used to estimate the d-band characteristics of bulk systems as well as mono- and bimetallic surface structures."
[3] "The model incorporates the effects of both electronic and geometric contributions."
[4] "It is shown that the proposed model can be used to estimate the surface electronic structure as well as to explain trends in catalytic properties of metal and alloy surfaces in terms of surface and adsorbate orbital properties."
[5] "This broadening of the d-band width leads to a shift in d-band centre to more negative values and thus to less reactive catalytic surfaces."
[6] "The trends in the d-band centres of pure metal surfaces are shown in Figure 5, where it can be seen that reactivity decreases from left to right and from top to bottom in the periodic table with Ag having an even more negative d-band centre than Au."

The document discusses how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance. By utilizing correlations between d-band widths and interatomic matrix elements, a tight-binding model is developed to estimate d-band characteristics of bulk systems and monometallic/bimetallic surface structures. This model captures both electronic and geometric contributions, enabling estimations of surface electronic structure and trends in catalytic properties based on surface and adsorbate orbital properties. As per the document, the broadening of the d-band width results in a shift to more negative d-band centers, which correlates with decreased reactivity. Trends in d-band centers across the periodic table show decreasing reactivity from left to right and from top to bottom, with Ag exhibiting an even more negative d-band center than Au.

文档讨论了过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能。通过利用d带宽度与原子间矩阵元素之间的相关性，提出了一种结合电子和几何贡献的紧密绑定模型，用于估计包括单金属和双金属表面结构在内的宏观系统。该模型能够估算表面电子结构以及基于表面和吸附剂轨道性质解释金属和合金表面的催化性质趋势。根据文档，d带宽度的扩展导致d带中心向更负值偏移，这与降低的反应活性相关。周期表中d带中心的趋势显示，从左到右、从上到下，反应活性逐渐降低，其中银的d带中心比金更负。
