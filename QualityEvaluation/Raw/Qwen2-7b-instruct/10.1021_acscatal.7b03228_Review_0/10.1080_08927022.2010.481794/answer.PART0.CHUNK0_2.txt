[1] "The reactivity of surfaces is related to their ability to make chemical bonds."
[2] "Adsorption is then considered in two steps. First, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the surface sp states to form a stabilised adsorbate species."
[3] "Second, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the d-orbitals in the transition metal surface."
[4] "Thus, features of the d-states are the primary factors for the altering interactions between adsorbates for different metal surfaces."
[5] "The d-band model provides descriptive parameters based on a convenient characteristic value that is a representative of the entire d-band, d-band centre (1d) or d-band width (Wd),and connects them to surface reactivity."
[6] "The modifications in d-band characteristics can be estimated through a correlation between the width of the surface d-band for transition metals and the interatomic matrix element (Vdd) that describes bonding interactions between an atom and its environment."
[7] "This would constitute a new and fast way of screening potential alloy surfaces that could even be extended to include many different surface structures for the purpose of identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties."
[8] "The utility of the new solid-state table with the d-band width formalism needs to be checked for bulk structures as well as for some surfaces with different facets considering the number of nearest neighbours, coordination number of the surface atoms."
[9] "The consideration of the interaction of different types of atoms is restricted neither to Pd-based structures nor to surface impurities."
[10] "Ourmodel provides a tool for estimating d-band widths, which are in many cases linearly correlated with the d-band centres."

The document outlines how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the d-band characteristics. The d-band model, which relates the surface reactivity to the d-band properties, provides descriptive parameters such as the d-band centre (1d) and width (Wd). The width of the surface d-band is correlated with the interatomic matrix element (Vdd), indicating bonding interactions between atoms and their environment. This correlation enables the estimation of d-band characteristics for different alloy surfaces, facilitating a faster screening process for identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties. The model can be applied to both bulk structures and surface structures, taking into account the number of nearest neighbors and coordination numbers. The document further suggests that the interaction of different types of atoms in alloys is crucial for determining catalytic performance, emphasizing the importance of considering various surface impurities and overlayer/host combinations in the model. Overall, the d-band width formalism offers a valuable tool for estimating d-band widths, which are often linearly correlated with d-band centers, providing insights into surface reactivity and catalytic behavior.

文档概述了过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能，通过改变d带特性。d带模型提供了一种描述性参数，如d带中心（1d）和宽度（Wd），将这些参数与表面活性联系起来。表面d带的宽度与原子与其环境之间的键合相互作用的原子间矩阵元素（Vdd）成正比，这表明了原子对之间的键合。这种相关性允许对不同合金表面的d带特性进行估计，从而实现更快的筛选过程以识别具有所需化学性质的表面。该模型可以应用于单个结构以及具有不同晶面的表面结构，考虑到邻近原子的数量和表面原子的配位数。文档进一步指出，在合金中不同类型原子的交互对于确定催化性能至关重要，强调在模型中考虑各种表面杂质和覆盖层/基质组合的重要性。总的来说，d带宽度形式提供了估计d带宽度的有价值工具，这些宽度通常与d带中心线性相关，为表面活性和催化行为提供见解。
