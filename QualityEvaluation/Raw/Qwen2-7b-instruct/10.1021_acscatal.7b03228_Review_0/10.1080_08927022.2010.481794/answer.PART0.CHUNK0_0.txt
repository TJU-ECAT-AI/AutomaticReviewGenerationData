3.1 Details of the d-band width formalism The coupling matrix describing the interaction of an atom with its environment has been generalised based on the distance dependence between an orbital of angular momentum quantum number l and one of quantum number l0. It has been shown that the correlation can be expressed as Vll0  Cll0d 2ll01;1 with Cll0 being a constant value that contains a factor r ll01 [11]. This factor is metal specific. For the matrix element involving coupling of two d-states, the above equation can be written in the following form: Vdd  hdd h2r3 d md 5 ;2 where hdd is a constant, set to unity for convenience and h 2/m  7.62 eVA
2. rd is a characteristic length for each transition metal that is related to the spatial extent of the d-orbitals. The derived values of the characteristic lengths are based on the high correlations between the band width (energy difference between the levels H12 H 0 25 for bcc and X1X5 for fcc structures) and computed matrix elements.

To estimate the modifications in d-band characteristics due to the combined effect of electronic and geometric contributions from different surface structures and alloying, correlations between d-band widths and interatomic matrix elements are utilized. A d-band width formalism is proposed to predict the electronic structures of bulk atoms, clean surface structures with various facets, bimetallic systems, and surface impurities. A new solid-state table incorporating parameters derived from density functional theory calculations is constructed. This model allows for quick screening of alloy surfaces to identify those with desirable electronic and chemical properties without extensive computational cost.
