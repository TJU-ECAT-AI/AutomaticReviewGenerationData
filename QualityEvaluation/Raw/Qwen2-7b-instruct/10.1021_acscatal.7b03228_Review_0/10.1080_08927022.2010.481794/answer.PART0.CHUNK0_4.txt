"Given the importance of the d-band characteristics in providing explanations for the reactivity of metal surfaces [10], it is desirable to study and understand the modifications of these electronic properties with respect to different electronic and geometric effects. This can be achieved by considering density functional theory (DFT) calculations as computer experiments where the role of the electronic and geometric effects can be determined separately."

"We attribute this to an electronic strain, where the Pd d-orbitals are not as crowded by the smaller 3d orbitals as they would be by other Pd orbitals. Consequently, they are effectively under-coordinated, resulting in a sharpening of the d-band."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
This phenomenon is attributed to electronic strain, wherein the Pd d-orbitals are less crowded by the smaller 3d orbitals compared to other Pd orbitals. As a result, they become effectively under-coordinated, leading to the narrowing of the d-band.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这种现象归因于电子应力，在这种应力下，Pd d轨道比其他Pd轨道更少被较小的3d轨道填充。因此，它们实际上协调不足，导致d带的变窄。
