3.1 Details of the d-band width formalism The coupling matrix describing the interaction of an atom with its environment has been generalised based on the distance dependence between an orbital of angular momentum quantum number l and one of quantum number l0. It has been shown that the correlation can be expressed as Vll0  Cll0d 2ll01;1 with Cll0 being a constant value that contains a factor r ll01 [11]. This factor is metal specific. For the matrix element involving coupling of two d-states, the above equation can be written in the following form: Vdd  hdd h2r3 d md 5 ;2 where hdd is a constant, set to unity for convenience and h 2/m  7.62 eVA
2. rd is a characteristic length for each transition metal that is related to the spatial extent of the d-orbitals. The derived values of the characteristic lengths are based on the high correlations between the band width (energy difference between the levels H12 H 0 25 for bcc and X1X5 for fcc structures) and computed matrix elements.

To estimate the modifications in d-band characteristics due to the combined effect of electronic and geometric contributions from different surface structures and alloying, correlations between d-band widths and interatomic matrix elements are utilized. A d-band width formalism is proposed to predict the electronic structures of bulk atoms, clean surface structures with various facets, bimetallic systems, and surface impurities. A new solid-state table incorporating parameters derived from density functional theory calculations is constructed. This model allows for quick screening of alloy surfaces to identify those with desirable electronic and chemical properties without extensive computational cost.

The document discusses how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance. By utilizing correlations between d-band widths and interatomic matrix elements, a tight-binding model is developed to estimate d-band characteristics of bulk systems and monometallic/bimetallic surface structures. This model captures both electronic and geometric contributions, enabling estimations of surface electronic structure and trends in catalytic properties based on surface and adsorbate orbital properties. As per the document, the broadening of the d-band width results in a shift to more negative d-band centers, which correlates with decreased reactivity. Trends in d-band centers across the periodic table show decreasing reactivity from left to right and from top to bottom, with Ag exhibiting an even more negative d-band center than Au.

The document outlines how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the d-band characteristics. The d-band model, which relates the surface reactivity to the d-band properties, provides descriptive parameters such as the d-band centre (1d) and width (Wd). The width of the surface d-band is correlated with the interatomic matrix element (Vdd), indicating bonding interactions between atoms and their environment. This correlation enables the estimation of d-band characteristics for different alloy surfaces, facilitating a faster screening process for identifying surfaces with desired chemical properties. The model can be applied to both bulk structures and surface structures, taking into account the number of nearest neighbors and coordination numbers. The document further suggests that the interaction of different types of atoms in alloys is crucial for determining catalytic performance, emphasizing the importance of considering various surface impurities and overlayer/host combinations in the model. Overall, the d-band width formalism offers a valuable tool for estimating d-band widths, which are often linearly correlated with d-band centers, providing insights into surface reactivity and catalytic behavior.

文档概述了过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应如何协同影响催化性能，通过改变d带特性。d带模型提供了一种描述性参数，如d带中心（1d）和宽度（Wd），将这些参数与表面活性联系起来。表面d带的宽度与原子与其环境之间的键合相互作用的原子间矩阵元素（Vdd）成正比，这表明了原子对之间的键合。这种相关性允许对不同合金表面的d带特性进行估计，从而实现更快的筛选过程以识别具有所需化学性质的表面。该模型可以应用于单个结构以及具有不同晶面的表面结构，考虑到邻近原子的数量和表面原子的配位数。文档进一步指出，在合金中不同类型原子的交互对于确定催化性能至关重要，强调在模型中考虑各种表面杂质和覆盖层/基质组合的重要性。总的来说，d带宽度形式提供了估计d带宽度的有价值工具，这些宽度通常与d带中心线性相关，为表面活性和催化行为提供见解。

The reactivity of surfaces is related to their ability to make chemical bonds. These bonds consist of a distribution of electrons over bonding and anti-bonding adsorbate-surface states involving the surface metal sp and d orbitals. Adsorption is then considered in two steps. First, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the surface sp states to form a stabilised adsorbate species. The contribution to bonding from this step is approximately the same for the transition metals because the sp states are broad and featureless [3]. Second, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the d-orbitals in the transition metal surface. This interaction results in a splitting of the adsorbate states into bonding and anti-bonding states. The strength of the bond depends on the occupation of these orbitals. If the anti-bonding states are above the Fermi level, they are unoccupied and the bond is strong. If the anti-bonding states are below the Fermi Level, they are occupied, and the bond is weak. Thus, features of the d-states are the primary factors for the altering interactions between adsorbates for different metal surfaces.

The catalytic performance of transition-metal alloys is influenced by the synergy between geometric and electronic effects. Geometrically, the presence of different elements in the alloy can cause strain, which affects the d-band structure. Electronically, the interaction between the alloying elements and the host atoms modifies the d-band characteristics, impacting surface reactivity. Strategies to exploit this interplay include selecting alloy compositions that optimize d-band properties for specific catalytic reactions. For instance, choosing elements that either broaden or narrow the d-band width can adjust the surface reactivity, potentially enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity compared to traditional monometals.
