The reactivity of surfaces is related to their ability to make chemical bonds. These bonds consist of a distribution of electrons over bonding and anti-bonding adsorbate-surface states involving the surface metal sp and d orbitals. Adsorption is then considered in two steps. First, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the surface sp states to form a stabilised adsorbate species. The contribution to bonding from this step is approximately the same for the transition metals because the sp states are broad and featureless [3]. Second, the adsorbate orbitals interact with the d-orbitals in the transition metal surface. This interaction results in a splitting of the adsorbate states into bonding and anti-bonding states. The strength of the bond depends on the occupation of these orbitals. If the anti-bonding states are above the Fermi level, they are unoccupied and the bond is strong. If the anti-bonding states are below the Fermi Level, they are occupied, and the bond is weak. Thus, features of the d-states are the primary factors for the altering interactions between adsorbates for different metal surfaces.

The catalytic performance of transition-metal alloys is influenced by the synergy between geometric and electronic effects. Geometrically, the presence of different elements in the alloy can cause strain, which affects the d-band structure. Electronically, the interaction between the alloying elements and the host atoms modifies the d-band characteristics, impacting surface reactivity. Strategies to exploit this interplay include selecting alloy compositions that optimize d-band properties for specific catalytic reactions. For instance, choosing elements that either broaden or narrow the d-band width can adjust the surface reactivity, potentially enhancing catalytic efficiency and selectivity compared to traditional monometals.
