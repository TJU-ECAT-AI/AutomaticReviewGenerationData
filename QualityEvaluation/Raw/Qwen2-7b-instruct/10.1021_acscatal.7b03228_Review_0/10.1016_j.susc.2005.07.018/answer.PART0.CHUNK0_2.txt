[1] "A general scheme for the estimation of oxygen binding energies on binary transition metal surface alloys is presented."
[2] "Variations in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects are all incorporated into the binding energy analysis through this parameter."
[3] "Given the simplicity and relatively high accuracy of the approach, we expect that it will find application in a large number of problems in which oxygen chemistry is important."
[4] "The majority of the data points show deviations of less than 0.2 eV from the parity line; given the very simple techniques used for the estimation, this agreement is remarkably good."
