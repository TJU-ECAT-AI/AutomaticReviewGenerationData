[1] "A simple scheme for the estimation of the binding energy of oxygen at threefold sites on transition metal surface alloys is presented."
[2] "The scheme incorporates the effect of changes in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects into the binding energy analysis through a single parameter, the surface d-band center."
[3] "With few exceptions, the agreement of the results from the simple model with full DFT calculations on a large number of binary alloys is remarkably good."
[4] "This agreement supports the notion that the d-band center is a parameter of considerable descriptive power for a broad range of alloy systems."
[5] "Further, the scheme is sufficiently accurate that it should provide a simple, fast, and reliable method for the estimation of oxygen binding energies on a wide variety of transition metal surface alloys."

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by affecting the binding energy of adsorbates. A simple scheme has been developed to estimate this binding energy, focusing on the surface d-band center. This parameter accounts for changes in chemical composition, strain effects, and ligand effects. The scheme is remarkably accurate for a wide variety of binary alloys, supporting the notion that the d-band center is a powerful descriptor for alloy systems. As a result, this method offers a simple, fast, and reliable way to estimate oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys, potentially leading to the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems.
