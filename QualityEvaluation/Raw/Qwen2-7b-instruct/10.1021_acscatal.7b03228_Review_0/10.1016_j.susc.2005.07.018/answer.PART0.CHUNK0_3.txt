[1] "Given the importance of parameters such as binding energies in determining trends in catalytic activities, it is imperative to have efficient means of estimating the magnitude of these parameters for a variety of metals and alloys."
[2] "For example, if binding energies could be estimated from the properties of the clean alloy surfaces alone, significant savings could be realized."
[3] "In this contribution, we demonstrate that the simple approach described above is capable of producing semi-quantitative predictions of oxygen binding energies on a large number of binary transition metal alloys."
[4] "The majority of the data points show deviations of less than 0.2 eV from the parity line; given the very simple techniques used for the estimation, this agreement is remarkably good."

To address the synergy between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys influencing catalytic performance, the literature suggests employing a simple scheme that integrates these effects through the analysis of the surface d-band center. This method accounts for variations in chemical composition, strain, and ligand effects, providing a fast and effective way to estimate oxygen binding energies on transition metal surface alloys. The approach allows for the screening of numerous alloys, potentially leading to the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts. The method's accuracy and efficiency support its utility in predicting and optimizing catalytic properties across a broad range of alloy systems.
