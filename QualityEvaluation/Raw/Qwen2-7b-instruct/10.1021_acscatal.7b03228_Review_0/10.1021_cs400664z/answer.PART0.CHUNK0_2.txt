[1] "The theoretical analysis of transition-metal catalysts for formic acid decomposition indicates that geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance."
[2] "This interplay can lead to the development of innovative strategies to exploit this synergy in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts."
