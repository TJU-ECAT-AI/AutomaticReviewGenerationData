[1] "Silica-supported Pd and PdZn nanoparticles of a similar size were evaluated for neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation."
[2] "Monometallic Pd showed high neopentane hydrogenolysis selectivity. Addition of small amounts of Zn to Pd lead PdZn scatters in the EXAFS spectrum and an increase in the linear bonded CO by IR."
[3] "Increasing amounts of Zn lead to greater PdZn interactions, higher linear-to-bridging CO ratios by IR and complete loss of neopentane conversion."
[4] "PdNPs also had high selectivity for propane hydrogenolysis and thus were poorly selective for propylene."
[5] "The PdZn bimetallic catalysts, however, were able to preferentially catalyze dehydrogenation, were not active for propane hydrogenolysis, and thus were highly selective for propylene formation."
[6] "The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity was attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, demonstrating that hydrogenolysis requires a particular reactive ensemble whereas propane dehydroge- nation does not."

1. Transition-metal alloys, such as PdZn, exhibit synergistic effects between geometric and electronic properties that can significantly influence catalytic performance. Alloy formation can alter the electronic structure of the catalyst, affecting the bond strength of adsorbates. Geometrically, the introduction of a second metal can change the coordination environment of the active sites, impacting the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. For instance, in the case of neopentane hydrogenolysis, the addition of Zn to Pd results in a decrease in the selectivity for hydrogenolysis, while improving the selectivity for dehydrogenation, indicating the importance of the reactive ensemble for different types of reactions.

2. Innovative strategies for exploiting the interplay between geometric and electronic effects in designing catalysts can involve precise control of alloy composition and particle morphology. By tuning the atomic arrangement and coordination environment in bimetallic or multimetallic systems, it may be possible to optimize the catalytic properties for specific applications. For example, in the case of propane dehydrogenation, a catalyst with a higher proportion of active Pd sites can be designed to favor dehydrogenation reactions over hydrogenolysis, leading to enhanced selectivity for propylene production.

3. The design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometals can benefit from the integration of both geometric and electronic effects. This can be achieved through a combination of computational methods to predict optimal alloy compositions and experimental techniques to synthesize and characterize catalysts with desired properties. By carefully controlling factors such as particle size, shape, and surface chemistry, it may be possible to tailor catalysts for specific reactions, thereby enhancing their performance and selectivity.

1. 过渡金属合金，如PdZn，表现出几何和电子性质之间的协同效应，显著影响催化性能。合金形成可以改变催化剂的电子结构，影响吸附剂的键强度。几何上，引入第二种金属可以改变活性位点的协调环境，影响催化剂的反应性和选择性。例如，在异戊烷氢解的情况下，钯中添加锌导致氢解选择性的下降，而提高了脱氢的选择性，表明不同类型的反应需要特定的活性簇。

2. 利用几何和电子效应之间的相互作用设计更高效、更选择性且可调的催化剂的创新策略包括精确控制合金组成和粒子形态。通过调整合金的原子排列和协调环境，可能有可能优化催化剂的催化特性以满足特定应用的需求。例如，在丙烷脱氢的情况下，通过设计具有较高活性钯位点比例的催化剂，可以有利于脱氢反应而非氢解，从而提高丙烯生成的选择性。

3. 设计超越传统单一金属的更高效、更选择性和可调的催化系统，可以通过结合几何和电子效应来实现。这可以通过结合计算方法预测最佳合金组成和实验技术合成和表征具有所需属性的催化剂来实现。通过仔细控制诸如粒子大小、形状和表面化学等参数，可能有可能为特定反应定制催化剂，从而增强其性能和选择性。
