[1] "Silica-supported Pd and PdZn nanoparticles of a similar size were evaluated for neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation."
[2] "The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity was attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, demonstrating that hydrogenolysis requires a particular reactive ensemble whereas propane dehydroge- nation does not."
[3] "Although the average coordination environment in these catalysts is different, EXAFS is a bulk characterization; therefore, the surface composition and structure, which is responsible for the catalytic activity, is uncertain."
[4] "The linear-to-bridge-bound ratio calculated by comparing the raw areas of the different peaks is presented in Table 3."
[5] "All selectivities given in Table 4 are extrapolated to 0% conversion."
[6] "Since zinc does not adsorb CO, the amount of surface palladium was determined by chemisorption and used to calculate the TOR."

1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys interact to influence catalytic performance. Alloy formation can alter the electronic structure and coordination of surface atoms, affecting chemical reactivity. To exploit this interplay, one might design catalysts with specific alloy compositions to achieve desired selectivity and efficiency. For instance, by creating an intermetallic structure like PdZn, one can potentially achieve lower CO adsorption energy and improved selectivity for certain reactions, such as neopentane isomerization.

2. Zinc addition to palladium catalysts leads to a decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity. This is because zinc isolates active palladium atoms, suggesting that hydrogenolysis reactions require a specific ensemble of active sites, unlike propane dehydrogenation. By controlling the amount of zinc, one can tune the catalytic performance of palladium-based catalysts for different applications.

3. The exact surface composition and structure responsible for the catalytic activity of alloy catalysts, despite differences in coordination environments, remain uncertain due to the bulk nature of EXAFS characterization. This highlights the need for surface-sensitive techniques to fully understand the active sites involved in catalysis.

4. The linear-to-bridge-bound ratio of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption on the catalyst surface can be quantified by comparing the areas of the corresponding peaks. This ratio provides insights into the surface chemistry and potential pathways of the catalytic process.

5. Selectivity data in Table 4 reflects the efficiency of converting neopentane into various products, such as isopentane and hydrogenolysis byproducts. Extrapolating these values to 0% conversion allows for a comprehensive assessment of the catalyst's performance across the entire reaction range.

6. By determining the amount of surface palladium through CO chemisorption, one can calculate the turnover rate (TOR) of the catalyst. This metric provides a quantitative measure of the catalytic activity, enabling comparisons and optimizations for various industrial processes.

1. 在过渡金属合金中，几何和电子效应相互作用影响催化性能。通过形成合金可以改变表面原子的电子结构和协调性，从而影响化学反应性。为了利用这种交互作用，可以通过设计具有特定合金组成来实现所需的选择性和效率的催化剂。例如，通过创建像PdZn这样的互金属结构，可能能够实现较低的CO吸附能和某些反应的改进选择性，如正戊烷异构化。

2. 锌添加到钯催化剂中导致氢解选择性的下降。这是因为锌隔离了活性钯原子，表明氢解反应需要特定的活性位点，而丙烷脱氢化则不需要。通过控制锌的含量，可以调整钯基催化剂的不同应用的催化性能。

3. 尽管这些合金催化剂中的平均协调环境不同，但由于EXAFS是一种宏观表征，因此关于负责催化活性的表面组成和结构的确切信息仍然不确定。这强调了需要表面敏感技术来全面理解催化过程中涉及的活性位点。

4. 碳一氧化合物（CO）在催化剂表面的线性-桥接比可以通过比较对应峰面积来量化。这个比率提供了关于表面化学和潜在催化过程途径的见解。

5. 表4中给出的选择性数据反映了将正戊烷转化为各种产物（如正戊烷、异丁烷和氢解产物）的效率。将这些值外推至0%转化率允许对催化剂在整个反应范围内的性能进行全面评估。

6. 通过确定表面钯的量，即通过CO化学吸附，可以计算催化剂的周转率（TOR）。这一指标提供了催化活性的定量衡量，使得对于各种工业过程进行比较和优化成为可能。
