[1] "Silica-supported Pd and PdZn nanoparticles of a similar size were evaluated for neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation."
[2] "Adding small amounts of Zn to Pd leads to changes in the EXAFS spectrum and an increase in the linear bonded CO by IR."
[3] "Increasing amounts of Zn lead to greater PdZn interactions, higher linear-to-bridging CO ratios by IR and complete loss of neopentane conversion."
[4] "The PdZn bimetallic catalysts were able to preferentially catalyze dehydrogenation, were not active for propane hydrogenolysis, and thus were highly selective for propylene formation."
[5] "The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity was attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn."

1. Transition-metal alloys, such as PdZn, were evaluated for neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation, showing that the geometric and electronic effects synergistically influence catalytic performance.
2. Small additions of Zn to Pd nanoparticles modify the EXAFS spectrum and increase the linearly bonded CO by IR spectroscopy.
3. Greater PdZn interactions, higher linear-to-bridging CO ratios, and complete loss of neopentane conversion were observed with increased Zn content.
4. PdZn bimetallic catalysts favor dehydrogenation over hydrogenolysis, leading to high selectivity for propylene formation in propane dehydrogenation.
5. The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity is attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, indicating that hydrogenolysis requires a specific reactive ensemble.

1. 通过评价钯和钯锌合金纳米粒子相似大小对于正戊烷氢解异构化和丙烷氢解异构化，发现过渡金属合金的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能。
2. 少量添加锌到钯导致EXAFS谱图变化，并且红外光谱中线性结合的CO增加。
3. 随着锌含量的增加，钯锌相互作用增强，红外光谱中线性与桥接CO比升高，并且完全失去正戊烷转化能力。
4. 钯锌双金属催化剂优先催化脱氢反应，不活跃于丙烷氢解反应，因此具有高度选择性生成丙烯。
5. 氢解选择性的下降归因于活性钯原子被惰性金属锌隔离，表明氢解需要特定的活性簇集。
