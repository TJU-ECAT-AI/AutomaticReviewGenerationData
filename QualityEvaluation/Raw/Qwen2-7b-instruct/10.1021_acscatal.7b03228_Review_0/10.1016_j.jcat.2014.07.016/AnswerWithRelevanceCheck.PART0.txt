          To address the synergy between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys influencing catalytic performance, especially in neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation, several key points emerge:

          - Geometric and electronic modifications through alloying can alter the coordination environment of surface atoms, affecting reactivity and selectivity. For instance, the addition of Zn to Pd nanoparticles modifies the EXAFS spectrum and increases the linearly bonded CO by IR spectroscopy, indicating changes in reactivity.

          - Increasing amounts of Zn lead to enhanced PdZn interactions, higher linear-to-bridging CO ratios by IR, and a total loss of neopentane conversion, highlighting the complex interplay between geometric and electronic factors.

          - Bimetallic catalysts like PdZn demonstrate a preference for dehydrogenation over hydrogenolysis, particularly for propane, indicating distinct reactive ensembles required for different reactions.

          - The decrease in hydrogenolysis selectivity is attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, underscoring the necessity of specific active sites for hydrogenolysis reactions.

          - Understanding which factor—geometric or electronic—is more critical for a given reaction can guide the design of more effective catalysts.

          Innovative strategies involve carefully tuning the composition and structure of alloy catalysts to optimize their performance for specific reactions, leveraging the synergies between geometry and electronic effects to achieve enhanced selectivity and efficiency.

          为了探讨过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的协同作用如何影响催化性能，特别是针对正戊烷氢解异构化和丙烷氢解异构化，以下几点至关重要：

          - 通过合金化进行的几何和电子修改会影响表面原子的协调环境，进而影响反应性和选择性。例如，向钯纳米颗粒中添加锌改变了EXAFS光谱，并通过IR光谱增加了线性结合的CO，这表明了反应性的变化。

          - 增加锌的量会导致钯锌相互作用增强，通过红外光谱测量的线性与桥接CO比增加，并且完全丧失了正戊烷的转化，这表明几何和电子因素之间存在复杂的相互作用。

          - 类似PdZn的双金属催化剂倾向于优先催化脱氢反应而非氢解反应，特别是对于丙烷，表明不同反应需要不同的活性簇集。

          - 氢解选择性的下降归因于惰性金属锌隔离了活性钯原子，突显了氢解反应需要特定的活性位点。

          - 理解对于特定反应而言，是几何还是电子因素更为重要，可以指导设计更有效的催化剂。

          创新策略包括精心调整合金催化剂的组成和结构，以优化它们针对特定反应的性能，利用几何和电子效应之间的协同作用来实现更高的选择性和效率。

          1. The interaction between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, specifically in the context of neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation, has been studied, revealing the following insights:

          - By altering the electronic structure and coordination environment of surface atoms through alloy formation, one can impact the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts. For example, the addition of Zn to Pd nanoparticles changes the EXAFS spectrum and increases the linearly bonded CO by IR spectroscopy, indicating adjustments in reactivity.

          - As the amount of Zn increases, there is an enhancement in PdZn interactions, higher linear-to-bridging CO ratios by IR, and a complete loss of neopentane conversion, showcasing the intricate dynamics between geometric and electronic factors.

          - Bimetallic catalysts such as PdZn demonstrate a preference for dehydrogenation over hydrogenolysis, particularly for propane, indicating distinct reactive ensembles necessary for different reactions.

          - The reduction in hydrogenolysis selectivity is attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, emphasizing the requirement of specific active sites for hydrogenolysis reactions.

          - Understanding which factor—geometric or electronic—is predominant for a specific reaction can guide the design of improved catalysts.

          - Innovative strategies involve carefully adjusting the composition and structure of alloy catalysts to optimize their performance for specific reactions, harnessing the synergies between geometric and electronic effects to achieve enhanced selectivity and efficiency.
