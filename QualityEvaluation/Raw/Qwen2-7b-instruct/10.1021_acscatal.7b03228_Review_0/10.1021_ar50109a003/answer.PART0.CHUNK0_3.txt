(1) "Although progress in the use of alloys to elucidate the electronic factor in metal catalysis has been slow, interest in bimetallic systems has not declined. In fact, there has been a great revival of interest in the field in recent years, for reasons other than a renewed probing into the electronic factor alone."
(2) "These include (a) the realization that bimetallic systems may exhibit major selectivity effects in catalysis, i.e., markedly different behavior toward different types of reactions, and (b) the development of the idea of highly dispersed bimetallic systems, i.e., bimetallic cluster catalysts."
(3) "While an electronic factor would in general be expected to influence the selectivity as well as the activity of bimetallic catalysts, the recent work indicates that purely geometric factors at a surface may play a crucial role in determining selectivity."
(4) "For a bimetallic catalyst to be of interest for industrial applications, it is necessary that it be prepared in a high surface area form and that it be resistant to loss of surface area during use. Dispersing it on a carrier provides an effective approach to the problem."
(5) "Research in our laboratory on systems of this type has culminated in the development of a new reforming catalyst which has been applied extensively in commercial operations."
(6) "In bimetallic systems the component with the lower heat of sublimation often accumulates in the surface. In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations, this component is the group 1B metal."
(7) "However, in the presence of a gas which interacts sufficiently strongly and selectively with the group 8 metal, the group 1B metal will not be the predominant component in the surface. Thus, in an oxygen atmosphere the surface of the nickel-gold system becomes rich in nickel rather than in gold."
(8) "Similarly, in an atmosphere of carbon monoxide the surface of palladium-silver alloys becomes enriched with palladium, whereas normally silver would be the predominant surface component."
(9) "In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations, this component is the group 1B metal."
(10) "The surface areas of the catalysts in Figure 1 are of the order of 1 m2/g (approximately one metal atom out of a thousand is a surface atom)."
(11) "In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations, this component is the group 1B metal."
(12) "In the case of group 8-group 1B metal combinations, this component is the group 1B metal."
(13) "The data suggest that a ruthenium-copper aggregate consists of small patches or clusters of copper on the surface of a crystallite composed essentially of pure ruthenium."
(14) "The data suggest that a ruthenium-copper aggregate consists of small patches or clusters of copper on the surface of a crystallite composed essentially of pure ruthenium."
