[1] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "This in turn has sparked investment in new butane dehydrogenation (BDH) installations in the United States, China, and Japan."
[3] "To the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to compare such a wide range of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single review article, although other reviews have been published in recent years dealing with the dehydrogenation of light paraffins."
[4] "A Catofin installation generally consists of 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors containing a chromia-alumina catalyst."
[5] "The reaction is run at temperatures of approximately 575 C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar."
[6] "As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene was being produced by the 14 propane dehydrogenation plants around the globe."
[7] "Indeed, the operating conditions also need to be considered, because activity is directly proportional to both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane."

1. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation relies heavily on the price disparity between propane and propylene, which contributes to favorable market conditions.
2. The increased demand for butadiene has led to investments in new butane dehydrogenation facilities in countries like the US, China, and Japan.
3. There is a scarcity of comprehensive reviews that compare a broad spectrum of dehydrogenation catalysts in a single publication, despite some recent attempts.
4. A Catofin dehydrogenation process typically employs 58 parallel adiabatic fixed bed reactors with a chromia-alumina catalyst.
5. The Catofin reaction is conducted at temperatures around 575°C and pressures between 0.2 and 0.5 bar.
6. As of April 2012, 5 million tons of propylene were being produced globally by 14 propane dehydrogenation plants.
7. The efficiency of dehydrogenation processes is influenced by both the reaction temperature and the partial pressure of the alkane involved.
