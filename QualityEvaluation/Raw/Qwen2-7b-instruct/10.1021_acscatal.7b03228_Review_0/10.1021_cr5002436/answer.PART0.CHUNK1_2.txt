[1] "The chemistry of molybdenum oxide is comparable to that of vanadium oxide, as Mo can be present as MoOx monomers, polymers, or MoO3 crystallites, depending on the molybdenum loading, the type of support used, and catalyst preparation conditions."
[2] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[3] "However, elevated temperatures also lead to a drop in selectivity, as cracking becomes the dominant reaction."
[4] "It was suggested that the role of Pt is to assist hydrogen desorption, which facilitates the regeneration of the gallium hydride hydroxide species."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the active sites' reactivity and stability. Innovations in catalyst design can exploit this interplay by tuning alloy compositions to optimize the active site structure and electronic environment. For instance, the presence of multiple metal species in an alloy can create a cooperative effect where the electronic properties of one metal enhance the activity of the other. This synergy can lead to the creation of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. By controlling the alloy composition, one can tailor the catalytic behavior to outperform traditional monometals in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.
