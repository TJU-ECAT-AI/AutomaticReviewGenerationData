[1] "Even though the dehydrogenation reaction has been studied for almost a century, the exact mechanism is still a topic under debate, particularly because this reaction is catalyzed by a vast array of materials as different as noble metals and transition metal oxides."

[2] "In this approach, the effects of various factors, such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support, are not considered."

[3] "However, it should be noted that specific activity values are a very rough approximation of the real TOF of these catalysts."

5.1 In terms of reaction mechanism and deactivation pathway, the exact mechanism of dehydrogenation is still debated due to the diverse catalytic materials involved, ranging from noble metals to transition metal oxides. The effects of various factors such as pressure, temperature, preparation method, promoter, and catalyst support are not considered in this comparison. Specific activity values provide a rough estimate of the real turnover frequency of these catalysts.

按照反应机制和失活途径，脱氢反应的确切机制仍然存在争议，因为涉及的催化材料从贵金属到过渡金属氧化物范围广泛。在比较中没有考虑各种因素，如压力、温度、制备方法、促进剂和催化剂支持。特定活性值为这些催化剂的真实转速频率提供了一个粗略的估计。

5.2 In terms of propane and isobutane dehydrogenation performance, metal oxide-based catalysts can achieve comparable yields to platinum-based catalysts, but they deactivate much faster at similar yields. Platinum-based catalysts are more stable, can operate at higher space velocities, and generally have lower deactivation rates.

就丙烷和异丁烷脱氢性能而言，金属氧化物基催化剂可以获得与铂基催化剂相似的产率，但在相似的产率下它们的失活速度要快得多。铂基催化剂更稳定，可以在更高的空间速度下操作，并且通常具有较低的失活率。
