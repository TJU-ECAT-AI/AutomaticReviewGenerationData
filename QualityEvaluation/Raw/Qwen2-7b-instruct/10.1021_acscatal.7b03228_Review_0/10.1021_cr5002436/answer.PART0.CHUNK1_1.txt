[1] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[2] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[3] "In recent work by Sattler et al., a 3 wt % Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted with 1000 ppm of Pt and 0.25 wt % of K to obtain a highly active, selective, and stable PDH catalyst."
[4] "However, metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, albeit they deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations."
[5] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."
[6] "Nevertheless, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[7] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

1. The complex and poorly understood process of coke formation leads to accumulation that blocks pores and active sites on the catalyst surface, causing a decrease in catalytic activity. Reducing coke deposition can be achieved by using a support with minimal Brnsted acidity or poisoning acid sites.

2. A 3 wt % Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted with 1000 ppm of Pt and 0.25 wt % of K to achieve high activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH catalysts.

3. Metal oxide-based catalysts can achieve yields comparable to Pt-based catalysts, but they deactivate faster than Pt-based catalysts.

4. New PDH projects announced in recent years will utilize either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts.

5. Metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate quickly due to coke deposition and inability to fully recover activity through regeneration steps.

6. Combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can monitor industrial chromiaalumina catalysts to enhance the efficiency of alkane dehydrogenation processes.

1. 焦炭形成的过程复杂且了解不足，会导致焦炭积累阻塞孔隙和活性位点，降低催化剂活性。通过使用酸性较低的载体或毒化酸性位点可以显著减少焦炭沉积。

2. 通过添加1000ppm的Pt和0.25wt％的K，对3wt％的Ga/Al2O3催化剂进行促进，可以获得高活性、选择性和稳定性的PDH催化剂。

3. 金属氧化物基催化剂可以与铂基催化剂获得类似产量，但它们的失活速度比铂基催化剂更快。

4. 近年来宣布的新PDH项目将采用CrOx/Al2O3（Catofin）或PtSn/Al2O3（Oleflex）催化剂。

5. 由于焦炭沉积和无法完全通过再生步骤恢复活性，金属氧化物基催化剂的失活速度很快。

6. 结合时间分辨紫外光谱和拉曼光谱可以监控工业氧化铝基催化剂，以提高未来烷烃脱氢过程的效率。
