[1] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "A solution for this is the doping of alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts with alkali ions, which can effectively poison these undesirable acid sites."
[3] "However, the use of alumina as support is not free of drawbacks. For instance, Al2O3 can catalyze cracking and coking due to its surface acidity, which leads to a drop in both activity and selectivity."
[4] "This has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."
[5] "Indeed, studies on the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane have revealed that catalytic activity based on ethane conversion and ethylene yields follows the order CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41  CrOx/MgO  CrOx/Si-2."

1. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation largely hinges on the price disparity between propane and propylene, making the current market conditions advantageous.
2. Alkali ion doping is a solution to mitigate the negative impacts of undesirable acid sites on alumina-based dehydrogenation catalysts.
3. The use of alumina as a support can result in decreased activity and selectivity due to its surface acidity that catalyzes cracking and coking.
4. Large alkali cations enhance catalytic activity by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites.
5. The catalytic activity order for ethane conversion and ethylene yield, based on studies, is CrOx/γ-Al2O3 > CrOx/SiO2 > CrOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MgO > CrOx/Si-2.
