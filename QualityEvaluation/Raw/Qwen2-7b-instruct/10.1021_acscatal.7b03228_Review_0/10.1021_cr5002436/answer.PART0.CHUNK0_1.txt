[1] "Two main types of formulations are typically used for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metal-based and metal oxide-based catalysts."
[2] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."
[3] "A notable exception to this promotion effect has been found in the doping with K+ of several PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, galliumchromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia."
[4] "Indeed, it is believed that the similar ionic radii and charge of Al3+ and Cr3+ facilitate the diffusion and subsequent incorporation of Cr3+ into the octahedral sites of alumina, which produces a type of chromiaalumina spinel that is inactive for the dehydrogenation reaction."

1. Two primary types of catalyst formulations are utilized for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light olefins: noble metals and metal oxides.
2. The Pacol process, an industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology by UOP, was launched in 1968.
3. Doping with K+ has shown to decrease the catalytic activity of certain PDH catalysts, such as chromia-pillared α-zirconium phosphate, galliumchromium mixed oxides pillared α-zirconium phosphate, and chromia/zirconia.
4. The similarity in ionic radii and charge between Al3+ and Cr3+ enables the diffusion and incorporation of Cr3+ into the alumina support, forming an inactive chromiaalumina spinel.

1. 用于非氧化脱氢的轻烯烃的两种主要催化剂类型：贵金属和金属氧化物。
2. UOP的Pacol过程，一种工业烷基脱氢化技术，在1968年首次商业化。
3. 在某些PDH催化剂中，如α-锆磷酸盐包覆的铬氧化物、镓铬混合氧化物包覆的α-锆磷酸盐和铬氧化物/锆氧化物，掺杂K+已显示出降低催化活性。
4. 铝3+和Cr3+离子相似的电荷和半径使Cr3+能够扩散并融入到氧化铝支持中，形成一种对脱氢反应无效的氧化铝-铬氧化物相。
