Transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance through the combination of geometric and electronic effects. This leads to enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. Strategies involve designing alloys with specific structures and compositions to optimize catalytic properties. The formation of alloy phases alters the electronic structure, impacting reactivity and selectivity. Geometric arrangements of atoms in the alloy also affect the availability of active sites. By leveraging these effects, researchers aim to create more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems than traditional monometals.
