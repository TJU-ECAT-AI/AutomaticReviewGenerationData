[1] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Coke is a collective name given to a large family of highly graphitized hydrocarbon molecules that tend to form on the catalyst surface during reaction. Coke accumulation effectively hinders the diffusion of reactants to the catalyst surface by blocking both pores and active sites, which results in a drop in catalytic activity."
[2] "Coke deposition can be dramatically reduced by using a support with little to no Brnsted acidity, or by poisoning the acid sites."
[3] "In recent work by Sattler et al., a 3 wt % Ga/Al2O3 catalyst was promoted with 1000 ppm of Pt and 0.25 wt % of K to obtain a highly active, selective, and stable PDH catalyst."
[4] "However, metal oxide-based catalysts can afford yields comparable to those obtained using Pt-based formulations, albeit they deactivate faster than the Pt-based formulations."
[5] "Indeed, dozens of new PDH projects have been announced in the past few years. The installations proposed or being built will employ either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts."
[6] "Nevertheless, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[7] "Therefore, the monitoring of industrial chromiaalumina catalysts by combined time-resolved UVvis and Raman spectroscopies can be employed to improve the overall efficiency of future alkane dehydrogenation processes."

4. New PDH projects announced in recent years will utilize either CrOx/Al2O3 (Catofin) or PtSn/Al2O3 (Oleflex) catalysts.

5. Metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate quickly due to coke deposition and inability to fully recover activity through regeneration steps.

[2] "The first industrial alkane dehydrogenation technology, the Pacol process (UOP), was first commercialized in 1968."

Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the active sites' reactivity and stability. Innovations in catalyst design can exploit this interplay by tuning alloy compositions to optimize the active site structure and electronic environment. For instance, the presence of multiple metal species in an alloy can create a cooperative effect where the electronic properties of one metal enhance the activity of the other. This synergy can lead to the creation of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. By controlling the alloy composition, one can tailor the catalytic behavior to outperform traditional monometals in terms of activity, selectivity, and stability.
