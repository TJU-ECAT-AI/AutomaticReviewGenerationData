[1] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[3] "The addition of CO2 as a mild oxidant is known to improve the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing the evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, which effectively shifts the equilibrium toward product formation."
[4] "For environmental reasons, the use of MTBE has declined in recent years, causing a shift in the use of Catofin installations to alternative purposes, such as propane dehydrogenation."

1. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price gap between propane and propylene, indicating favorable market conditions at present.
2. The abundance of affordable ethane has led to a transition in the US from naphtha-based to ethane-based steam cracking processes, with naphtha crackers either being decommissioned or converted.
3. Incorporating CO2 as a mild oxidant enhances the activity of chromium dehydrogenation catalysts by removing evolved hydrogen, thus promoting product formation through the reverse water gas shift reaction.
4. Due to environmental concerns, the decline in MTBE usage has prompted a shift in the application of Catofin processes from producing MTBE to dehydrogenating propane.

1. 环丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差距，当前市场条件非常有利。
2. 由于廉价乙烷的丰富供应，美国已从基于石脑油的蒸汽裂解转向基于乙烷的蒸汽裂解过程，石脑油裂解装置要么被拆除，要么被改造。
3. 将二氧化碳作为温和氧化剂加入可以提高铬基脱氢催化剂的活性，通过逆水煤气变换反应去除生成的氢气，从而有效促进产物形成。
4. 由于环境因素，MTBE使用量的下降促使Catofin工艺从生产MTBE转向丙烷脱氢的应用。
