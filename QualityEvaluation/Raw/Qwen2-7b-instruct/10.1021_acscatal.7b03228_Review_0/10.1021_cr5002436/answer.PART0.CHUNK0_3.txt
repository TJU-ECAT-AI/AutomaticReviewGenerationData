[1] "Fortunately, these side reactions are catalyzed by specific sites that are not required for dehydrogenation, which means that high olefin yields can be obtained by careful catalyst design."
[2] "Indeed, cracking reactions are efficiently catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, while large Pt ensembles also display activity for hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization reactions."
[3] "However, it was not possible to calculate turnover frequency (TOF) due to the fact that Pt dispersion values (the ratio between the Pt at the surface versus the interior of the catalyst nanoparticles) were not forthcoming in most of the references included in Table 3."
[4] "Summarizing, Figure 12 shows an artist impression of a PtSn nanoparticle on alumina."
[5] "It should also be mentioned that many other factors could also influence the activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[6] "Indeed, there is a direct relationship between catalytic activity and the reducibility of the catalysts (see Figure 19)."
[7] "Interestingly, it has been observed that while the selectivity of this material toward cracking decreases with time-on-stream, its selectivity toward the alkene tends to remain constant."

1. These side reactions are catalyzed by sites that are not needed for dehydrogenation, allowing for high olefin yields through careful catalyst design.
2. Cracking reactions are effectively catalyzed by Brnsted acid sites, and large Pt ensembles exhibit activity for hydrogenolysis, cracking, and isomerization.
3. Calculating turnover frequency (TOF) was not feasible due to lacking Pt dispersion values in most references.
4. Figure 12 depicts an artistic representation of a PtSn nanoparticle on alumina.
5. Many other factors can affect the activity of Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts.
6. There's a direct link between catalyst reducibility and activity, as seen in Figure 19.
7. The selectivity towards cracking decreases over time for the material, while selectivity towards the alkene stays constant.

1. 这些副反应由不需要进行脱氢的位点催化，通过精心设计催化剂可以获得高烯烃产率。
2. 裂解反应被Brnsted酸位点有效催化，而较大的铂簇也表现出氢解、裂解和异构化反应活性。
3. 由于大多数参考文献中缺乏铂分散度值，因此无法计算周转频率（TOF）。
4. 图12展示了氧化铝上的PtSn纳米颗粒的艺术描绘。
5. 许多其他因素可以影响Cr基脱氢催化剂的活性。
6. 催化剂的可还原性与活性之间存在直接联系，如图19所示。
7. 材料的裂解选择性随时间下降，而烷基选择性保持不变。
