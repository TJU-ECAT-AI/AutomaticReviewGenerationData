[1] "The differences in the specific activity values described previously could be explained by comparing the activation energies calculated by DFT methods previously discussed in section 4. In these calculations, the energy barrier for the rate limiting step on PtSn system is lower (109 kJ mol1) than in the CrOx and GaOx catalysts (161 and 163 kJ mol1, respectively)."
[2] "However, care must be taken when comparing these Ea values, as the methods used for obtaining these are not identical."
[3] "Nevertheless, these combined theoretical and experimental data are very encouraging and highlight the need for more extensive studies on the reaction rate on Pt- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts."

1. The differences in specific activity between Pt and metal oxide catalysts could be explained by comparing the activation energies for the rate limiting step. For the PtSn system, the energy barrier is lower (109 kJ mol1) compared to CrOx (161 kJ mol1) and GaOx (163 kJ mol1) catalysts. However, caution should be exercised when comparing these values as the methods used for calculation might not be identical.

2. These findings, combining theoretical and experimental data, are encouraging and suggest the need for more extensive studies on the reaction rates on Pt- and metal oxide-based dehydrogenation catalysts.

1. Pt和金属氧化物催化剂之间特定活性差异可以通过比较速率限制步骤的激活能量来解释。对于PtSn系统，能量壁垒较低（109 kJ mol1），而CrOx为161 kJ mol1，GaOx为163 kJ mol1。但是，在比较这些值时需要谨慎，因为用于计算的方法可能不完全相同。

2. 这些结合理论和实验数据的结果是鼓舞人心的，并且表明需要对Pt-和金属氧化物基脱氢催化剂的反应速率进行更广泛的深入研究。
