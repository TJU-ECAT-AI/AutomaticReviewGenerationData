To predict and compare the CM (catalyst-metal) and OM (substrate-metal) bond strengths for adsorption on transition metal surfaces, one must consider the synergistic influence of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys. These effects play a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance. By understanding and exploiting the interplay between these effects, innovative strategies can be developed to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts.

为了预测和比较吸附在过渡金属表面的CM（催化剂-金属）和OM（基底-金属）键强度，必须考虑过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应的协同影响。这些效应在决定催化性能方面起着关键作用。通过理解并利用这些效应之间的相互作用，可以开发出创新策略来设计更高效、选择性和可调的催化系统，这些系统优于传统的单金属催化剂。
