            To predict and compare the CM (catalyst-metal) and OM (substrate-metal) bond strengths for adsorption on transition metal surfaces, one must consider the synergistic influence of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys.

By understanding and exploiting the interplay between these effects, innovative strategies can be developed to design more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometals.

            These studies reveal that alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) on the Pt(111) surface can create a novel hydrogenation pathway for selectively producing butene from 1,3-butadiene. The (2 × 2) alloy shows the highest conversion efficiency due to the closely matched desorption activation energies of hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene, compared to other alloys. Additionally, there is a small amount of low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound 1,3-butadiene to butene, with an activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol. Site-blocking effects by hydrogen atoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption are observed on both Sn/Pt(111) alloys, similar to those seen on Pt(111). Furthermore, no further hydrogenation reactions producing butane were observed.
