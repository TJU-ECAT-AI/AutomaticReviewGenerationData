          [1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."
          [2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the 3 alloy."
          [3] "We also observed a small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene, which desorbed in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K corresponding to a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol."
          [4] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111)."
          [5] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."
          [6] "No further hydrogenation reactions producing butane were observed."
          [7] "We estimated the activation energy barriers to hydrogenation of strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene to be 91 and 72 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) alloy and 3 alloys, respectively, by considering the butene desorption that occurs at 354 and 282 K."

          These studies reveal that alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) on the Pt(111) surface can create a novel hydrogenation pathway for selectively producing butene from 1,3-butadiene. The (2 × 2) alloy shows the highest conversion efficiency due to the closely matched desorption activation energies of hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene, compared to other alloys. Additionally, there is a small amount of low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound 1,3-butadiene to butene, with an activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol. Site-blocking effects by hydrogen atoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption are observed on both Sn/Pt(111) alloys, similar to those seen on Pt(111). Furthermore, no further hydrogenation reactions producing butane were observed.

          这些研究揭示了将锡（Sn）与铂（Pt）合金化在Pt(111)表面可以创造一种新型的氢化途径，用于从共吸附的H和1,3-丁二烯中选择性生产丁烯。在(2×2)合金中，由于氢和1,3-丁二烯的脱附活化能高度匹配，表现出最高的转换效率，与其它合金相比。此外，还观察到了少量在较低温度下由弱结合的1,3-丁二烯氢化为丁烯的过程，该过程的活化壁垒为46 kJ/mol。在Sn/Pt(111)合金上观察到了氢原子对1,3-丁二烯吸附的位阻效应，与在Pt(111)上观察到的现象类似。此外，没有进一步的氢化反应产生但烷被观察到。
