1. The interaction between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, specifically in the context of neopentane hydrogenolysis/isomerization and propane hydrogenolysis/dehydrogenation, has been studied, revealing the following insights:

          - By altering the electronic structure and coordination environment of surface atoms through alloy formation, one can impact the reactivity and selectivity of catalysts. For example, the addition of Zn to Pd nanoparticles changes the EXAFS spectrum and increases the linearly bonded CO by IR spectroscopy, indicating adjustments in reactivity.

          - As the amount of Zn increases, there is an enhancement in PdZn interactions, higher linear-to-bridging CO ratios by IR, and a complete loss of neopentane conversion, showcasing the intricate dynamics between geometric and electronic factors.

          - Bimetallic catalysts such as PdZn demonstrate a preference for dehydrogenation over hydrogenolysis, particularly for propane, indicating distinct reactive ensembles necessary for different reactions.

          - The reduction in hydrogenolysis selectivity is attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by inactive metallic Zn, emphasizing the requirement of specific active sites for hydrogenolysis reactions.

          - Understanding which factor—geometric or electronic—is predominant for a specific reaction can guide the design of improved catalysts.

          - Innovative strategies involve carefully adjusting the composition and structure of alloy catalysts to optimize their performance for specific reactions, harnessing the synergies between geometric and electronic effects to achieve enhanced selectivity and efficiency.

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys interact synergistically, impacting their catalytic performance. This interaction results in enhanced selectivity and efficiency, surpassing traditional monometallic catalysts. Innovative strategies can leverage this synergy by designing alloys with optimized composition and structure, aiming to create catalytic systems that outperform conventional monometals.

To address the question, we refer to the predictive structure-reactivity models for rapid screening of Pt-based multimetallic electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. These models highlight the synergistic influence of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys on catalytic performance. Innovative strategies for designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems have been developed by exploiting this interplay.

To predict and compare the bond strengths of CM (carbon-monoxide) and OM (oxygen-monoxide) adsorption on transition metal surfaces, the study focuses on the synergistic effects of geometric and electronic properties in transition-metal alloys. This interplay aims to develop innovative strategies for designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts.
