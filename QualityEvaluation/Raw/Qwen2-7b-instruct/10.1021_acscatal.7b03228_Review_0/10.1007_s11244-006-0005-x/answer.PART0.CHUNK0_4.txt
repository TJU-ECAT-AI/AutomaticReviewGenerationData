[1] "Bimetallic systems show strongly modified chemical properties compared to those of their single components. These modifications are caused by the direct electronic interaction between the components together with geometric effects because of the different lattice constants."
[2] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
[3] "Electronic structure calculations are well-suited in order to allow a discrimination between these two effects."
[4] "These bimetallic systems might be used as bifunctional catalysts."
[5] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by altering the reactivity of the system. The direct electronic interaction between components and the geometric effect due to different lattice constants cause modifications in the chemical properties of bimetallic systems. These modifications enable the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometals.

2. Bimetallic systems can be engineered to act as bifunctional catalysts. This is achieved by combining a more reactive metal with a smaller lattice constant and a more inert metal with a larger lattice constant. The presence of two different elements on the surface allows for the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms, where one species adsorbs one reactant and the other species adsorbs another reactant.

3. Electronic structure calculations are crucial in discerning the contributions of geometric and electronic effects. These calculations provide insights into the microscopic factors underlying the reactivity of bimetallic systems.

4. Bimetallic systems with properties beyond those of their single components can be used as bifunctional catalysts. These systems exhibit enhanced reactivity and selectivity, making them suitable for complex catalytic processes.

5. When a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, and there is a strong interaction between the metals, a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties can be formed. This metal may possess unique catalytic properties that surpass those of the individual components.

1. 过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能，通过改变体系的反应性。组件之间的直接电子相互作用和由于不同晶格常数导致的几何效应导致双金属系统的化学性质发生变化。这些变化使设计更高效、选择性和可调的催化系统成为可能，这些系统优于传统的单金属催化剂。

2. 双金属系统可以通过结合活性更高的金属（晶格常数较小）和惰性更大的金属（晶格常数较大）来设计为双功能催化剂。表面存在两种不同元素允许实现双功能机制，其中一种物种吸附一个反应物，另一种物种吸附另一个反应物。

3. 电子结构计算对于区分几何和电子效应至关重要。这些计算提供了深入理解双金属系统微观因素以揭示其反应性的见解。

4. 具有超过单个成分特性的双金属系统可以用作双功能催化剂。这些系统表现出增强的反应性和选择性，使其适合复杂催化过程。

5. 当活性更高的金属（晶格常数较大）与惰性更大的金属（晶格常数较小）混合，并且两者之间存在强烈相互作用时，可以形成一种新的、几乎同质的金属，具有介于两种成分之间的性质。这种金属可能具有超越各自成分的独特催化特性。
