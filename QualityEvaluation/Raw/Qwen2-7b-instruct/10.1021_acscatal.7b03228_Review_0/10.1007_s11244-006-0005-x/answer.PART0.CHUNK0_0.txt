[1] "Bimetallic systems show strongly modified chemical properties compared to those of their single components. These modifications are caused by the direct electronic interaction between the components together with geometric effects because of the different lattice constants."
[2] "While it is hard (but not impossible) to dis-entangle these effects experimentally, electronic struc- ture calculations are well-suited in order to allow a discrimination between these two effects."
[3] "These bimetallic systems might be used as bifunctional catalysts."
[4] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by modifying chemical properties, enhancing selectivity, and improving efficiency. Electronic interactions and lattice mismatches can lead to the formation of new, more active catalysts.

2. Electronic structure calculations are crucial for distinguishing between geometric and electronic effects in bimetallic systems, allowing for a deeper understanding of their catalytic behavior.

3. Bimetallic systems can potentially be utilized as bifunctional catalysts, offering enhanced performance over monometallic catalysts.

4. When a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, a bimetallic system forms with intermediate properties, acting as a new, almost homogeneous metal that can outperform traditional catalysts.

1. 过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能，通过修改化学性质、增强选择性和提高效率。电子相互作用和晶格失配可能导致形成更活跃的催化剂。

2. 电子结构计算对于区分二元合金系统中的几何和电子效应至关重要，允许深入了解它们的催化行为。

3. 双金属体系可能被用作双功能催化剂，提供超过单金属催化剂的增强性能。

4. 当更活泼的金属（晶格常数较大）与较不活泼的金属（晶格常数较小）混合时，并且两者之间存在强烈的相互作用时，会形成具有中间特性的二元合金，表现为新近均质金属，其性能可以超越传统催化剂。
