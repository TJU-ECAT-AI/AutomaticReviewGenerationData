[1] "Bimetallic systems show strongly modified chemical properties compared to those of their single components. These modifications are caused by the direct electronic interaction between the components together with geometric effects because of the different lattice constants."
[2] "While it is hard (but not impossible) to disentangle these effects experimentally, electronic structure calculations are well-suited in order to allow a discrimination between these two effects."
[3] "As this review has shown, one can distinguish between two different classes of bimetallic systems."
[4] "If a more reactive metal with a smaller lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a larger lattice constant, such as Ru and Pt or Pd and Au, then a bimetallic system will result that, e.g., binds adsorbates more strongly than any single component in a comparable structure."
[5] "If, on the other hand, a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction between the two elements, then a bimetallic system may be formed that behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal with intermediate properties."

Answer: 
The interplay between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys significantly influences catalytic performance. When a more reactive metal with a smaller lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a larger lattice constant, such as Ru and Pt or Pd and Au, a bimetallic system forms that binds adsorbates more strongly than any single component. This is due to the synergistic effects of the direct electronic interaction and lattice mismatch. This system can potentially act as a bifunctional catalyst, enhancing its catalytic properties. Conversely, when a more reactive metal with a larger lattice constant is mixed with a more inert metal with a smaller lattice constant, such as Pd and Cu, and there is a strong mutual interaction, a bimetallic system is formed with intermediate properties between the single components. This system behaves as a new, almost homogeneous metal, offering tunable catalytic performance. These principles can be exploited in the rational design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems.

交互作用在过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应显著影响催化性能。当更活泼的金属（较小的晶格常数）与较惰性的金属（较大的晶格常数）混合时，例如Ru和Pt或Pd和Au，形成一个双金属系统，该系统的吸附剂结合力比任何单一成分在类似结构中更强。这是由于直接电子相互作用和晶格失配的协同效应。这种体系可能作为双功能催化剂发挥作用，增强其催化性能。相反，当更活泼的金属（较大的晶格常数）与较惰性的金属（较小的晶格常数）混合，并且两者之间存在强烈的相互作用时，形成一种具有单个组件之间介于中间性质的双金属系统。这种体系表现出类似于新、近乎均质金属的行为，提供可调的催化性能。这些原理可以用于设计更高效、选择性和可调的催化体系。
