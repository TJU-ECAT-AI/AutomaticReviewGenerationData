[1] "Bimetallic systems show strongly modified chemical properties compared to those of their single components. These modifications are caused by the direct electronic interaction between the components together with geometric effects because of the different lattice constants."
[2] "While it is hard (but not impossible) to disentangle these effects experimentally, electronic structure calculations are well-suited in order to allow a discrimination between these two effects."
[3] "The presence of two different elements on a bimetallic surface alloy offers for example the possibility of bifunctional mechanisms [42] where one species may adsorb one reactant and the other species the other reactant for a desired reaction."
[4] "For pseudomorphic bimetallic overlayer systems, I just showed how a combination of first-principles calculations and experiments can differentiate between geometric and ligand effects. For surface alloys, to disentangle these effects is not so easy since no homogeneous substrate is present where for example the interatomic distances can be changed uniformly."
[5] "However, these guiding principles must still be checked using a larger database but they might already be helpful for the rational design of bimetallic catalysts."

To develop innovative strategies to exploit the synergy between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys for designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems, researchers can leverage computational methods such as electronic structure calculations. These methods enable the differentiation between geometric and electronic effects, which are crucial in modifying the catalytic performance of alloys. By combining these calculations with experimental data, scientists can identify bimetallic systems that exhibit properties beyond those of their individual components, potentially leading to the creation of bifunctional catalysts. Moreover, the principles derived from such studies can guide the rational design of bimetallic catalysts, optimizing their performance for specific catalytic reactions. This approach not only enhances the catalytic efficiency and selectivity but also opens up the possibility of creating catalysts that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts in terms of performance and versatility.
