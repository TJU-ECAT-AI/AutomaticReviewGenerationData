To address the question, we refer to the predictive structure-reactivity models for rapid screening of Pt-based multimetallic electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. These models highlight the synergistic influence of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys on catalytic performance. Innovative strategies for designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems have been developed by exploiting this interplay.
