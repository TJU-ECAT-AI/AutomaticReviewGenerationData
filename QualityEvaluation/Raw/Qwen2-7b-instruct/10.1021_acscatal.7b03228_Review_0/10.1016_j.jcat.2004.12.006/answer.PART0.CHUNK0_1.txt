[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This hydrogenation reaction was observed on both of the two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys investigated. No further hydrogenation reactions producing butane were observed."
[2] "We estimated the activation energy barriers to hydrogenation of strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene to be 91 and 72 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) alloy and 3 alloys, respectively, by considering the butene desorption that occurs at 354 and 282 K."
[3] "However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), that is, θH = 0.49 and 0.34 ML on the (2×2) and 3 alloy, respectively, compared with θH = 0.91 on Pt(111)."
[4] "This leads to high coverages of both reactants at the highest temperatures, and this synergy might be exploited in practical catalyst by control of the Sn concentration."
[5] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111). However, the amount of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to complete block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the two alloys was much less than that needed on Pt(111), that is, θH = 0.49 and 0.34 ML on the (2×2) and 3 alloy, respectively, compared with θH = 0.91 on Pt(111)."

The geometric and electronic effects of alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) create a new hydrogenation pathway on the Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, enabling the selective production of butene from 1,3-butadiene. This contrasts with the hydrogenation chemistry occurring on pure Pt(111) surfaces. The activation energy for hydrogenation of strongly bound 1,3-butadiene is estimated to be 91 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) alloy and 72 kJ/mol on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy. The amount of hydrogen needed to block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the Sn/Pt(111) alloys is notably less than on pure Pt(111), requiring 0.49 ML on the (2 × 2) alloy and 0.34 ML on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy. This synergy between reactant concentrations and hydrogenation efficiency can be harnessed to improve catalyst performance. Additionally, site-blocking effects of hydrogen atoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both alloys, but required less hydrogen coverage compared to pure Pt(111) to achieve the same effect.

合金化锡（Sn）与铂（Pt）在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上创建了一种新的氢化途径，允许从1,3-丁二烯选择性生产丁烯。这与纯Pt(111)表面上发生的氢化化学形成对比。强烈吸附的1,3-丁二烯的氢化激活能估计为91 kJ/mol在(2 × 2)合金和72 kJ/mol在(3 × 3)R30合金上。在Sn/Pt(111)合金上所需的氢气量比纯Pt(111)少，需要0.49 ML在(2 × 2)合金和0.34 ML在(3 × 3)R30合金上达到相同的吸附效果。这种反应物浓度和氢化效率之间的协同作用可以用来提高催化剂性能。此外，在两个合金上观察到了氢原子对1,3-丁二烯吸附的位点阻塞效应，但与纯Pt(111)相比，所需的氢气覆盖量更少以实现相同的效果。
