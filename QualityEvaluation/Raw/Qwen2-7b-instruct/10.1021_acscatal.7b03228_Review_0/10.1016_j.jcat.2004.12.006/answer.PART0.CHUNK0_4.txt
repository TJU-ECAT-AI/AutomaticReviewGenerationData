[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."
[2] "No further hydrogenation reactions producing butane were observed."
[3] "We estimated the activation energy barriers to hydrogenation of strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene to be 91 and 72 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) alloy and 3 alloys, respectively, by considering the butene desorption that occurs at 354 and 282 K."
[4] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the 3 alloy."

Answer: How do geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, and what innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts?

The study reveals that alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) creates a new hydrogenation pathway for converting 1,3-butadiene to butene, selectively and efficiently. The activation energy barrier for this reaction is estimated to be 91 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) alloy and 72 kJ/mol on the (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy. These findings suggest that geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically enhance catalytic performance. Innovative strategies could involve designing catalysts with optimized alloy compositions that match the desorption activation energies of reactants and products, thereby maximizing reaction efficiency. By tuning the Sn concentration in supported SnPt catalysts, one can achieve a balance where hydrogenation reactions occur more efficiently, leading to higher conversion rates and selectivities compared to traditional monometallic catalysts.

如何在设计更高效、选择性和可调的催化系统时，利用过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应协同作用，并且这些系统可以超越传统的单金属催化剂？

研究发现，将锡（Sn）与铂（Pt）合金化可以在加热含氢和1,3-丁二烯的层状催化剂中打开新的氢化途径，以选择性且高效地将1,3-丁二烯转化为丁烯。强化学吸附的1,3-丁二烯的氢化激活能估计为91 kJ/mol在(2×2)Sn/Pt(111)合金上，以及72 kJ/mol在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上。这些结果表明，过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应可以协同增强催化性能。创新策略可以涉及设计具有优化合金组成的催化剂，使反应物和产物的脱附激活能相匹配，从而最大化反应效率。通过调整支持的SnPt催化剂中的Sn浓度，可以获得平衡，使得氢化反应发生得更加有效，导致与传统单金属催化剂相比更高的转化率和选择性。
