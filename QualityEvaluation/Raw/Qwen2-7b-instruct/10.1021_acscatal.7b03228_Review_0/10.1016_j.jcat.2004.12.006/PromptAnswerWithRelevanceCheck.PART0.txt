[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This hydrogenation reaction was observed on both of the two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys investigated. No further hydrogenation reactions producing butane were observed."
[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the 3 alloy."
[3] "We also observed a small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene, which desorbed in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K corresponding to a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol."

1. Alloying Sn with Pt(111) creates a new hydrogenation pathway that allows for the selective production of butene from 1,3-butadiene during the heating of coadsorbed hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). This was observed on two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. No further hydrogenation leading to butane production was observed.
2. The highest conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene occurred on the (2 × 2) alloy, which is likely due to the close match in activation energies for hydrogen desorption and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation on this alloy compared to the 3 alloy.
3. A small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed, with a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol, resulting in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K.

1.Sn与Pt(111)合金化开辟了一条与仅使用Pt(111)表面化学反应不同的氢化途径，用于在TPD过程中从共吸附的氢和1,3-丁二烯选择性生成丁烯。这一现象在两个有序的Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上观察到。没有观察到进一步导致但烷生成的氢化反应。
2.在两种合金中，1,3-丁二烯转化为丁烯的最高转化率发生在(2×2)合金上，这可能是由于(2×2)合金上的氢解吸和1,3-丁二烯氢化过程的激活能接近，而3合金上的激活能不同。
3.观察到了少量容易的、低温下的1,3-丁二烯π键弱结合态的氢化，生成但烯，其氢化激活能为46 kJ/mol，在200 K以下形成反应速率限制的峰值。

The geometric and electronic effects of alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) create a new hydrogenation pathway on the Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, enabling the selective production of butene from 1,3-butadiene. This contrasts with the hydrogenation chemistry occurring on pure Pt(111) surfaces. The activation energy for hydrogenation of strongly bound 1,3-butadiene is estimated to be 91 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) alloy and 72 kJ/mol on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy. The amount of hydrogen needed to block 1,3-butadiene chemisorption on the Sn/Pt(111) alloys is notably less than on pure Pt(111), requiring 0.49 ML on the (2 × 2) alloy and 0.34 ML on the (3 × 3)R30 alloy. This synergy between reactant concentrations and hydrogenation efficiency can be harnessed to improve catalyst performance. Additionally, site-blocking effects of hydrogen atoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both alloys, but required less hydrogen coverage compared to pure Pt(111) to achieve the same effect.

合金化锡（Sn）与铂（Pt）在Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上创建了一种新的氢化途径，允许从1,3-丁二烯选择性生产丁烯。这与纯Pt(111)表面上发生的氢化化学形成对比。强烈吸附的1,3-丁二烯的氢化激活能估计为91 kJ/mol在(2 × 2)合金和72 kJ/mol在(3 × 3)R30合金上。在Sn/Pt(111)合金上所需的氢气量比纯Pt(111)少，需要0.49 ML在(2 × 2)合金和0.34 ML在(3 × 3)R30合金上达到相同的吸附效果。这种反应物浓度和氢化效率之间的协同作用可以用来提高催化剂性能。此外，在两个合金上观察到了氢原子对1,3-丁二烯吸附的位点阻塞效应，但与纯Pt(111)相比，所需的氢气覆盖量更少以实现相同的效果。

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly the incorporation of Sn into Pt(111), synergistically influence catalytic performance. This leads to a new hydrogenation pathway that allows selective production of butene from 1,3-butadiene. The activation energy barriers for hydrogenation are estimated to be 91 and 72 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) and (3) alloys, respectively. Maximizing hydrogenation reactions occurs when the activation energies for 1,3-butadiene and recombinative H2 desorption match. Hydrogenation proceeds through surface-bound butenyl groups as intermediates, resulting in reaction-rate-limited butene desorption. Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption are observed on both alloys, similar to Pt(111), but with significantly lower amounts of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to block chemisorption.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应，特别是将Sn引入到Pt(111)中，协同影响催化性能。这开辟了一条新的氢化途径，允许从1,3-丁二烯选择性生产丁烯。氢化反应的活化能估计为91和72千焦/摩尔在（2×2）和（3）合金上，分别。当1,3-丁二烯和重组H2脱附的活化能相匹配时，最大化氢化反应。氢化通过表面结合的但烯基中间体进行，导致反应速率限制的丁烯脱附。观察到1,3-丁二烯吸附的位点阻塞效应在两个Sn/Pt(111)合金上都存在，类似于Pt(111)，但是需要更低的预吸附氢量来阻止化学吸附。

These findings suggest that geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. By alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt), researchers discovered a new hydrogenation pathway that selectively produces butene from 1,3-butadiene. This pathway is facilitated by the unique properties of Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, where the nearly matching desorption activation energies of hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene on the (2×2) alloy maximize hydrogenation efficiency compared to the 3 alloy. Additionally, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed, indicating the potential for enhanced catalytic activity under specific conditions. Site-blocking effects by hydrogen adatoms were also noted, affecting the adsorption and reaction of 1,3-butadiene on these alloys, showcasing the importance of surface chemistry in catalytic performance.

Answer: How do geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, and what innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts?

The study reveals that alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt) creates a new hydrogenation pathway for converting 1,3-butadiene to butene, selectively and efficiently. The activation energy barrier for this reaction is estimated to be 91 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2)Sn/Pt(111) alloy and 72 kJ/mol on the (3 × 3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy. These findings suggest that geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically enhance catalytic performance. Innovative strategies could involve designing catalysts with optimized alloy compositions that match the desorption activation energies of reactants and products, thereby maximizing reaction efficiency. By tuning the Sn concentration in supported SnPt catalysts, one can achieve a balance where hydrogenation reactions occur more efficiently, leading to higher conversion rates and selectivities compared to traditional monometallic catalysts.
