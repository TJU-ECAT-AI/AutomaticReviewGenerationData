[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This hydrogenation reaction was observed on both of the two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys investigated. No further hydrogenation reactions producing butane were observed."
[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the 3 alloy."
[3] "We also observed a small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene, which desorbed in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K corresponding to a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol."

1. Alloying Sn with Pt(111) creates a new hydrogenation pathway that allows for the selective production of butene from 1,3-butadiene during the heating of coadsorbed hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene in temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). This was observed on two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys. No further hydrogenation leading to butane production was observed.
2. The highest conversion of 1,3-butadiene to butene occurred on the (2 × 2) alloy, which is likely due to the close match in activation energies for hydrogen desorption and 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation on this alloy compared to the 3 alloy.
3. A small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed, with a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol, resulting in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K.

1.Sn与Pt(111)合金化开辟了一条与仅使用Pt(111)表面化学反应不同的氢化途径，用于在TPD过程中从共吸附的氢和1,3-丁二烯选择性生成丁烯。这一现象在两个有序的Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上观察到。没有观察到进一步导致但烷生成的氢化反应。
2.在两种合金中，1,3-丁二烯转化为丁烯的最高转化率发生在(2×2)合金上，这可能是由于(2×2)合金上的氢解吸和1,3-丁二烯氢化过程的激活能接近，而3合金上的激活能不同。
3.观察到了少量容易的、低温下的1,3-丁二烯π键弱结合态的氢化，生成但烯，其氢化激活能为46 kJ/mol，在200 K以下形成反应速率限制的峰值。
