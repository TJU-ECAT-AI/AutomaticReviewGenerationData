[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD. This hydrogenation reaction was observed on both of the two ordered Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys investigated."
[2] "The highest conversion from 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed on the (2 × 2) alloy, and this is likely due to the nearly matching desorption activation energies of H2 and 1,3-butadiene on the (2 × 2) alloy, compared with that on the 3 alloy."
[3] "We also observed a small amount of facile, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound, π-bonded 1,3-butadiene to butene, which desorbed in reaction rate-limited peaks below 200 K corresponding to a hydrogenation activation barrier of 46 kJ/mol."
[4] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111)."

These findings suggest that geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. By alloying tin (Sn) with platinum (Pt), researchers discovered a new hydrogenation pathway that selectively produces butene from 1,3-butadiene. This pathway is facilitated by the unique properties of Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, where the nearly matching desorption activation energies of hydrogen and 1,3-butadiene on the (2×2) alloy maximize hydrogenation efficiency compared to the 3 alloy. Additionally, low-temperature hydrogenation of weakly bound 1,3-butadiene to butene was observed, indicating the potential for enhanced catalytic activity under specific conditions. Site-blocking effects by hydrogen adatoms were also noted, affecting the adsorption and reaction of 1,3-butadiene on these alloys, showcasing the importance of surface chemistry in catalytic performance.

这些发现表明，过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应可以协同影响催化性能。通过将锡（Sn）与铂（Pt）合金化，研究人员发现了一条从1,3-丁二烯选择性生成丁烯的新氢化途径。这种途径得益于Sn/Pt(111)表面合金的独特性质，在(2×2)合金上，氢和1,3-丁二烯的脱附活化能几乎相匹配，这使得氢化效率高于3合金。此外，观察到在较低温度下，弱结合的1,3-丁二烯氢化为丁烯，表明在特定条件下具有增强的催化活性的潜力。还注意到氢原子吸附的位阻效应，影响了这些合金上1,3-丁二烯的吸附和反应，强调了表面化学在催化性能中的重要性。
