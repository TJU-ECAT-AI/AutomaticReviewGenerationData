[1] "Alloying Sn with Pt(111) opens a new pathway for hydrogenation, compared with chemistry on Pt(111), to selectively produce butene during heating of coadsorbed layers of H and 1,3-butadiene in TPD."
[2] "We estimated the activation energy barriers to hydrogenation of strongly chemisorbed 1,3-butadiene to be 91 and 72 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) alloy and 3 alloys, respectively, by considering the butene desorption that occurs at 354 and 282 K."
[3] "On the (2 × 2) alloy, hydrogenation reactions are maximized when 1,3-butadiene and recombinative H2 desorption have the same activation energies."
[4] "Hydrogenation of 1,3-butadiene presumably proceeds through surface-bound butenyl groups as intermediates on both alloys to produce reaction-rate-limited butene desorption at 282354 K."
[5] "Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption were observed on both of the two Sn/Pt(111) alloys, as we saw previously on Pt(111)."

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, particularly the incorporation of Sn into Pt(111), synergistically influence catalytic performance. This leads to a new hydrogenation pathway that allows selective production of butene from 1,3-butadiene. The activation energy barriers for hydrogenation are estimated to be 91 and 72 kJ/mol on the (2 × 2) and (3) alloys, respectively. Maximizing hydrogenation reactions occurs when the activation energies for 1,3-butadiene and recombinative H2 desorption match. Hydrogenation proceeds through surface-bound butenyl groups as intermediates, resulting in reaction-rate-limited butene desorption. Site-blocking effects by H adatoms on 1,3-butadiene adsorption are observed on both alloys, similar to Pt(111), but with significantly lower amounts of preadsorbed hydrogen needed to block chemisorption.

过渡金属合金中的几何和电子效应，特别是将Sn引入到Pt(111)中，协同影响催化性能。这开辟了一条新的氢化途径，允许从1,3-丁二烯选择性生产丁烯。氢化反应的活化能估计为91和72千焦/摩尔在（2×2）和（3）合金上，分别。当1,3-丁二烯和重组H2脱附的活化能相匹配时，最大化氢化反应。氢化通过表面结合的但烯基中间体进行，导致反应速率限制的丁烯脱附。观察到1,3-丁二烯吸附的位点阻塞效应在两个Sn/Pt(111)合金上都存在，类似于Pt(111)，但是需要更低的预吸附氢量来阻止化学吸附。
