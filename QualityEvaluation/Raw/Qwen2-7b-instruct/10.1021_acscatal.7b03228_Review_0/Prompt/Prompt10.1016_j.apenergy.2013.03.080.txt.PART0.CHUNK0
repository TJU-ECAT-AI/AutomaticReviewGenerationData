I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature. Here is the literature, in <literature></literature> XML tags:

Progress in catalytic naphtha reforming process: A review Mohammad Reza Rahimpour a,b,, Mitra Jafari a, Davood Iranshahi a a Department of Chemical Engineering, School of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, Shiraz University, Shiraz 71345, Iran b Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of California, Davis, 1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA 95616, United States a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 12 July 2012 Received in revised form 12 March 2013 Accepted 28 March 2013 Keywords: Catalytic naphtha reforming Catalyst Kinetic model Deactivation model Reactor configuration a b s t r a c t Catalytic naphtha reforming process is a vital process for refineries due to the production of high-octane components, which is intensely demanded in our modern life. The significance of this industrial process induced researchers to investigate different aspects of catalytic naphtha reforming process intensively.
Some of the investigators try to improve this process by represe nting more effective catalysts, while oth- ers try to elucidate its kinetic and deactivation mechanisms and design more efficient reactor setups. The amount of these establishe d papers is so much that may confuse some of the researchers who want to find collective information about catalytic naphtha reforming process. In the present paper, the publi shed studies from 1949 until now are categorized into three main groups including finding suitable catalyst,revealing appropriate kinetic and deactivation model, and suggesting efficient reactor configuration and mode of operation. These studies are reviewed separat ely, and a suitable reference is provided for those who want to have access to generalized information about catalytic naphtha reforming process.
Finally, various suggestions for revamping the catalytic naphtha reforming process have been proposed as a guide line for further investigations. 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here are the question lists, in <questions></questions>XML tags:
<questions>


How do geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance, and what innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay in designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts?


</questions>

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
