In the field of catalysis, researchers have been exploring how geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. Strategies such as the synthesis of platinum-silver alloys, the examination of reactivity perturbations through geometry, and the investigation of electronic structures in alloys for CO-tolerant anode catalysts in polymer electrolyte fuel cells have been pursued. These efforts aim to develop more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts.
