The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance by enhancing the interaction between reactants and catalyst surfaces, improving the stability of the catalyst, and facilitating the transfer of electrons for better reaction efficiency. Innovative strategies can be developed by designing alloys with optimized atomic arrangements, selecting metals with complementary properties, and tailoring the alloy composition to match specific catalytic tasks. This approach aims to outperform traditional monometallic catalysts by achieving higher selectivity, efficiency, and tunability in catalytic systems.
