[1] "For transition-metal-based catalysts, the character of d band structure may govern catalysis because valence d electrons mediate the adsorption and elementary reaction steps."
[2] "The entire d band structure can be observed experimentally using X-ray emission and absorption spectra in the valence band region, which reflect occupied and unoccupied states, respectively."
[3] "Linic et al. employed the latter techniques with the aid of DFT calculations for the NiSn system. (283) They found that (1) the addition of Sn to Ni weakened adsorption of various species such as C, O, CH, and CO and that (2) the d band center of Ni was downshifted by alloying with Sn."
[4] "For instance, for Pt3Ti-catalyzed methanol electrooxidation, Pt3Ti with an ordered Pm3m structure (intermetallic compound with an L12 structure) showed a much higher current density than that with a disordered Fm3m structure (solid-solution alloy with an fcc structure (e.g., 0.34 vs 0.084 mAcm2 at the potential of +0.6 V), (34) indicating an influence from the ordering effect."
[5] "Note that the nature of the intrinsic ordering effect has not been clarified, they suggested two possibilities: the ordered structure (1) changes the lateral strain in the Pt-skin overlayer, modifying the binding energies of the adsorbates and (2) results in the formation of a skin-type rather than a skeleton-type morphology after dealloying."
[6] "Strictly speaking, for example, the adsorption energy of an oxygen atom on an individual surface may be an indicator of the degree of oxophilicity."

1. The character of the d band structure in transition-metal-based catalysts influences catalysis by mediating adsorption and elementary reaction steps, where valence d electrons play a crucial role.

2. The d band structure of transition-metal catalysts can be experimentally observed using X-ray emission and absorption spectra in the valence band region, reflecting the states of occupied and unoccupied states.

3. Linic et al. found that adding tin (Sn) to nickel (Ni) weakened the adsorption of various species and shifted the d band center of Ni when alloyed with Sn, indicating a change in electronic structure.

4. For Pt3Ti in catalyzing methanol electrooxidation, the ordered structure with a Pm3m crystal system showed significantly higher current density compared to the disordered structure with an Fm3m crystal system, suggesting the impact of the ordering effect on catalytic performance.

5. The ordering effect could alter the lateral strain in the Pt-skin overlayer, modify the binding energies of adsorbates, or lead to a different morphology after dealloying, influencing the catalytic activity.

6. The degree of oxophilicity of a metal surface can be quantified by the adsorption energy of an oxygen atom, serving as an indicator of the metal's inherent affinity towards oxygen.
