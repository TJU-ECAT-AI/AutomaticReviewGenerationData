[1] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
[2] "For oxidation and steam reforming, the positive roles of the intermetallic phases can be distinguished as follows: (i) suppressing undesired side reactions, (ii) improving catalyst stability, (iii) providing O2 adsorption sites, and (iv) acting as precursors of the active components."
[3] "The formation of intermetallic phases typically induces charge transfer from one metal to the other due to the significant difference in the electron-withdrawing character. (79, 81, 86) Partially charged metal atoms are likely to interact preferentially with polar molecules, providing a specific reaction pathway."
[4] "This enhancement was explained by an increase in surface energy, which was indicated both experimentally and theoretically. (249-251) A high-energy surface is likely to accelerate adsorption of the fuel molecules."
[5] "These effects and selective conversions rely strongly on the specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement, and hence, they are surely functions that only intermetallic compounds can perform."

1. Intermetallic phases provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, and enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation processes. 
2. In oxidation and steam reforming, intermetallic phases suppress unwanted side reactions, improve catalyst stability, provide oxygen adsorption sites, and serve as precursors for active components.
3. The formation of intermetallic phases induces charge transfer between metals, enhancing interaction with polar molecules and guiding specific reaction pathways.
4. The increase in surface energy due to the ordered atomic arrangement of intermetallic compounds accelerates the adsorption of fuel molecules, contributing to enhanced catalytic performance.
5. The specific and ordered surface atomic arrangement of intermetallic compounds enables unique functions that are exclusive to these materials, such as chiral recognition and precise control over reaction pathways.
