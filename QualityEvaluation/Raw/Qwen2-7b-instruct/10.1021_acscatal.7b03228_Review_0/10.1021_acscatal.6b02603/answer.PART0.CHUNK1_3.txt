[1] "Historically, this term was coined to indicate an electronic perturbation by neighboring second metal atoms against a long-range electronic effect."
[2] "The entire d band structure can be observed experimentally using X-ray emission and absorption spectra in the valence band region, which reflect occupied and unoccupied states, respectively."
[3] "This is because the d band center determines the positions of bonding and antibonding states, and hence the degree of filling of the antibonding states."
[4] "They also revealed that the number of d electrons and holes of Ni were preserved upon alloying with Sn, indicating no charge transfer between Ni and Sn."
[5] "For most compounds, atomic charges of surface Rh were slightly more negative than those of bulk Rh, probably due to the presence of dangling bonds."

The electronic and geometric effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. Electronic effects, such as changes in the d-band center and electron density, can be controlled by selecting appropriate second metals. Geometric effects, including ensemble and ligand effects, can alter adsorption modes and pathways, leading to enhanced selectivity. Together, these effects can create a well-designed reaction environment that improves catalytic activity and selectivity compared to traditional monometallic catalysts. Innovative strategies can be developed to exploit this interplay by precisely tuning the electronic structure and geometric arrangement of the alloy components, potentially leading to the creation of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems.
