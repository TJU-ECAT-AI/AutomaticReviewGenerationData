[1] "The formation of an alloy or an intermetallic phase changes the geometrical environment at the catalyst surface. From a microscopic perspective, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals (N) into the surface lattice of the parent active metal (M) decreases the coordination number of the surface MM shell and the size of M ensembles. Therefore, adsorption and/or reactions that require multifold sites or large ensembles are less favored on the alloyed surface, increasing the selectivity for allowed reactions."
[2] "In a commonly used sense, the ensemble effect indicates the change in the adsorption modes due to the reduction of the ensemble size. However, in some cases, this term means the change in adsorption energy itself due to the replacement of the adsorbent atom, (278, 293) which often becomes the driving force to change the adsorption mode."
[3] "Very recently, two examples of such catalysis were reported by Furukawa et al. using Rh-based intermetallic compounds. One is the stereoselective alkene isomerization by hydrogen over RhSb/SiO2, (123) briefly mentioned in section 3.1.2. Hydrogen-mediated alkene isomerization is generally accompanied by overhydrogenation to alkane due to hydrogen attack from several directions."
[4] "The relationship between the selectivity and Ead has a physical meaning as represented in eq 1:where rx, NSx, NS, and Ex (x = NO2 or CC) are the hydrogenation rate of x, adsorbed NS with x, unadsorbed NS, and adsorption energy of NS with x, respectively. The equation indicates the conversion of the rate ratio to the adsorbate concentration ratio and represents the fraction of adsorbed NS using the Boltzmann distribution equation with its Ead. As a consequence, a simple proportional relationship is found between the logarithm of the rate ratio and ΔE. The plot of this function shows a good linear relationship through the origin (Figure 20), demonstrating the validity of this model."

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance in several ways. Firstly, the incorporation of catalytically inert or less-active metals into the surface lattice of the parent active metal can decrease the coordination number and size of active metal ensembles, reducing the likelihood of multifold site or large ensemble-dependent reactions. This leads to an increase in the selectivity for allowed reactions. Secondly, the electronic state of the active metal can be drastically altered by forming intermetallic phases, influencing adsorption strengths and reaction pathways. For instance, Furukawa et al. reported that Rh-based intermetallic compounds could achieve stereoselective alkene isomerization. The hydrogen-mediated isomerization usually leads to overhydrogenation, but the RhSb/SiO2 system showed high trans-alkene selectivity due to the specific surface structure. The relationship between the hydrogenation rate and adsorption energy (Ead) demonstrates that the selectivity can be controlled by adjusting the adsorption energy, leading to a simple proportional relationship between the logarithm of the rate ratio and ΔE, which validates this model.

在过渡金属合金中，几何和电子效应可以协同影响催化性能。首先，将催化惰性或活性较低的金属引入母体活性金属的表面晶格中，可以降低表面MM壳层的配位数和M簇的大小。这减少了需要多折点或大簇的吸附或反应在合金表面的几率，从而提高了允许反应的选择性。其次，通过形成互金属化合物，活性金属的电子状态可以大幅度改变，影响吸附强度和反应途径。例如，Furukawa等人报道了基于铑的互金属化合物可以通过氢化作用实现立体选择性的烯烃异构化。通常，氢化作用会导致过氢化，但RhSb/SiO2系统显示出高顺式烯烃选择性，因为其特定的表面结构。吸附能量(Ead)与氢化速率之间的关系表明，可以通过调整吸附能来控制选择性，导致率比的对数值和ΔE之间存在简单的线性关系，验证了该模型的有效性。
