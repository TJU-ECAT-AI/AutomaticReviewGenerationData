To exploit the synergistic influence of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys for designing more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems, innovative strategies can be developed that focus on the precise tuning of the alloy composition and structure. By controlling the electronic structure through the introduction of specific second metals, one can enhance the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst. The geometric effects, particularly the steric hindrance provided by the unique surface structures of intermetallic compounds, can be manipulated to modulate the reaction pathways and prevent unwanted side reactions. This interplay between electronic and geometric factors allows for the creation of catalysts with tailored properties that surpass those of traditional monometallic catalysts.
