[1] "For selective (de)hydrogenation, intermetallic phases provide certain functions to protect or release a specific functional group, mainly alkenyl CC bonds, such as (1) anchoring sites, (2) modifying adsorption properties, or (3) molecular recognition ability."
[2] "In addition, a sufficient reduction in the ensemble size is referred to as site isolation. (95, 96)"
[3] "In this context, the formation of intermetallic or alloy phases is generally accompanied not only by ensemble effects but also by ligand effects."
[4] "For example, for alkene isomerization over RhSb/SiO2, a DFT-based Wulff construction suggested that the (211), (020), and (013) planes dominate the surface."
[5] "Although achieving enantioselective catalytic conversion such as hydrogenation remains a highly challenging task, it may be achieved in the near future."

1. Intermetallic phases provide anchoring sites, modify adsorption properties, or enable molecular recognition for selective (de)hydrogenation processes, particularly for protecting or releasing alkenyl CC bonds.

2. Site isolation refers to a sufficient decrease in the ensemble size, which is crucial for selective catalytic conversions.

3. The formation of intermetallic compounds often involves both ensemble effects and ligand effects, influencing adsorption and reaction dynamics.

4. The DFT-based Wulff construction suggests that specific crystal planes, such as (211), (020), and (013), play a dominant role in catalytic reactions over RhSb/SiO2 surfaces.

5. Challenging as it may be, the development of enantioselective catalytic conversions, including hydrogenation, is anticipated to advance in the coming years.

1. 在选择性氢化和脱氢过程中，互金属相提供了锚定点、修改吸附性质或分子识别能力，特别是对于保护或释放烯丙基CC键。

2. 站点隔离指的是显著减小簇集尺寸，这是选择性催化转化的关键。

3. 互金属化合物的形成通常伴随着簇集效应和配体效应，影响吸附和反应动力学。

4. 基于DFT的Wulff构造表明，在RhSb/SiO2表面催化反应中，特定晶面（如（211）、（020）和（013））起着主导作用。

5. 虽然挑战重重，但预计在不久的将来，将实现包括氢化在内的手性选择性催化转化。
