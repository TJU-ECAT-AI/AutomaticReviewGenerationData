[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, howevergold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
[3] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."
[4] "These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold."

Gold's nobleness is closely tied to its ability to form stable alloys with other metals and its unique reactivity. Gold shows distinct properties in surface reactions, particularly in the dissociation of hydrogen, which can be explained through the density-functional calculations that highlight two key factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These factors collectively impact the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and metal, as well as the energy barrier for dissociation, thus limiting adsorbate binding and reactivity on the gold surface.

黄金的高贵性与它与其他金属形成稳定合金的能力以及其表面反应的独特性质密切相关。在氢的分解等表面反应中，通过密度泛函计算可以清晰地揭示出两个关键因素：吸附时反键状态的填充程度和吸附物与金属的轨道重叠度。这两个因素共同作用，影响吸附剂与金属之间的相互作用强度及脱附能垒，从而限制了黄金表面上吸附剂的结合与后续反应性。
