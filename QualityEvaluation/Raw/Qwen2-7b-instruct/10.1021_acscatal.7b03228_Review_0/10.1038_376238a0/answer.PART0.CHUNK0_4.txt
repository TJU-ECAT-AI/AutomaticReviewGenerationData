[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, howevergold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
[3] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."
[4] "These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold."

Gold's nobleness, as it relates to its role in society, is due to its unique chemical properties. Specifically, gold is less reactive towards atoms or molecules at the interface with a gas or a liquid, despite being able to form stable alloys with other metals. This property is attributed to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. These factors together limit the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, thereby reducing adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold surfaces.

黄金的尊贵性，与它在社会中的角色密切相关，是由于其独特的化学性质。具体来说，黄金在气体或液体界面与原子或分子反应的能力较低，尽管它可以与其他金属形成稳定的合金。这种特性归因于两个因素：吸附时反键状态的填充程度和吸附质与吸附剂之间的轨道重叠程度。这两个因素共同决定了吸附剂-金属相互作用的强度以及解离的能量壁垒，从而限制了吸附剂结合和随后在金表面的活性。
