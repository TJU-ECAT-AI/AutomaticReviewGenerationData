[1] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
[2] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."
[3] "These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Gold's nobleness is determined by its ability to minimize adsorbate binding and reactivity through two key factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states upon adsorption and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. This unique role reflects the metal's stability and minimal reactivity with gases and liquids.

黄金的尊贵性由两个关键因素决定：吸附态上电子填满的程度以及与吸附剂的轨道重叠程度，这两个因素共同作用，最大限度地减少了吸附剂与金属之间的结合以及后续反应的活性。这种独特的角色反映了金属在气体和液体界面的稳定性和最低反应性。
