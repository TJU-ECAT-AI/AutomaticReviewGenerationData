[1] "The inertness of gold does not reflect a general inability to form chemical bonds, howevergold forms very stable alloys with many other metals."
[2] "To understand the nobleness of gold, we have studied a simple surface reaction, the dissociation of H2 on the surface of gold and of three other metals (copper, nickel and platinum) that lie close to it in the periodic table."
[3] "We present self-consistent density-functional calculations of the activation barriers and chemisorption energies which clearly illustrate that nobleness is related to two factors: the degree of filling of the antibonding states on adsorption, and the degree of orbital overlap with the adsorbate."
[4] "These two factors, which determine both the strength of the adsorbate-metal interaction and the energy barrier for dissociation, operate together to the maxima] detriment of adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold."

Understanding the nobleness of gold involves recognizing its exceptional stability in forming chemical bonds and alloys with other metals, particularly due to its unique surface reactions. Gold's noble properties are closely tied to the degree of filling of antibonding states during adsorption and the level of orbital overlap with the adsorbate. This interplay significantly affects the strength of the interaction between the adsorbate and the metal surface, as well as the energy barrier for dissociation, ultimately minimizing adsorbate binding and subsequent reactivity on gold.

理解黄金的高贵特性在于其在形成化学键和与其他金属合金时的非凡稳定性，尤其是由于其独特的表面反应。黄金的高贵属性紧密关联于吸附过程中反键状态的填充程度以及吸附质与吸附剂之间的轨道重叠程度。这种相互作用显著影响吸附质与金属表面之间的结合强度，以及解离能垒，最终减少了吸附质的结合和随后在黄金上的活性。
