[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "This contraction results in a shift of the d-band of Pd states away from the Fermi level from 2.01 eV in Pd to 2.48 eV in the alloy."
[4] "Similarly, in PdAu, the PdAu bond expands to 2.86 Å, and the d-band shifts accordingly toward the Fermi level to 1.64 eV."
[5] "When a d-band transition metal is alloyed with a nontransition metal (hereafter described as sp-electron metals), charge transfer can be significant."
[6] "This simple model has been shown to provide effective guidance for understanding catalytic performance in a number of systems, as the adsorbate binding strength (and by extension the d-band center) can be correlated with its activation on the metal surface."
[7] "Critical deviations between scaling of the d-band center with OH and CH adsorption can be accounted for by evaluating the additional terms, and new correlative relations can be developed."
[8] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[9] "At least three pathways for changing geometry have emerged in the literature over the course of the past few years: (1) intermetallic compounds, (2) single-atom alloys (SAAs), and (3) coadsorbed structural modifiers."

To develop more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts, the synergistic influence of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys must be harnessed. By exploiting the interplay between these effects, researchers can design alloys that not only modify the strength of adsorbate binding but also alter the adsorbate's bonding configuration. Strategies such as intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys (SAAs), and coadsorbed structural modifiers can be employed to achieve this. For instance, intermetallic compounds can fix the spatial relationship between metal atoms, preventing surface segregation in response to adsorption events, while SAAs and coadsorbed modifiers can introduce localized environments that perturb adsorbate geometry, leading to enhanced selectivity and performance.

为了设计出超越传统单金属催化剂的更高效、选择性和可调性更强的催化系统，必须利用过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的协同作用。通过利用这些效应之间的相互作用，研究人员可以设计合金不仅改变吸附剂结合强度，还能改变吸附剂的键合构型。例如，通过使用互金属化合物、单原子合金（SAAs）和共吸附结构修饰剂等策略来实现这一目标。例如，互金属化合物可以固定金属原子之间的空间关系，防止响应吸附事件时表面分离，而SAAs和共吸附修饰剂则可以引入局部环境，扰动吸附剂的几何形状，从而提高选择性和性能。
