[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "This contraction results in a shift of the d-band of Pd states away from the Fermi level from 2.01 eV in Pd to 2.48 eV in the alloy."
[3] "In plots of the d-bands of Pd, Pd in PdZn, and Pt, it is evident in Figure 1 that although Pt and PdZn may have similar d-band centers, the presence of Zn results in both a shift and a narrowing of the density of states with nearly complete depletion of d-electron density near the Fermi level, demonstrating a large electronic modification from the alloying event."
[4] "Critical deviations between scaling of the d-band center with OH and CH adsorption can be accounted for by evaluating the additional terms, and new correlative relations can be developed."
[5] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[6] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration."
[7] "For example, PtSn is the primary example of an intermetallic system (multiple intermetallic compounds of PtSn exist with varying stoichiometry) that has found extensive use in the field."

1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys synergistically influence catalytic performance by allowing the tailoring of reaction selectivity and tuning of metal reactivity. These effects can lead to improved catalytic activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts. Innovative strategies to exploit this interplay include the use of intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys (SAAs), and coadsorbed structural modifiers, which can alter adsorbate geometry beyond just modifying binding strength.

2. By altering the bonding configuration of adsorbates through geometric effects, catalytic systems can achieve higher selectivity and efficiency, breaking the limitations set by electronic structure correlations between adsorbate binding energies. Intermetallic compounds, in particular, offer a means to precisely control adsorbate configurations, leading to enhanced catalytic performance.
