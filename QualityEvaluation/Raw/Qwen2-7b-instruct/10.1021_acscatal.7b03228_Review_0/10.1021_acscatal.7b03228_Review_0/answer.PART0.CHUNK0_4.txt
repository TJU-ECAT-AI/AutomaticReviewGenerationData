[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "This contraction results in a shift of the d-band of Pd states away from the Fermi level from 2.01 eV in Pd to 2.48 eV in the alloy."
[4] "On the basis of these examples, in a PdPt alloy, one would expect the Pd d-band center to shift toward the Fermi level due to the larger lattice constant of Pt in comparison to Pd."
[5] "When a d-band transition metal is alloyed with a nontransition metal (hereafter described as sp-electron metals), charge transfer can be significant."
[6] "This simple model has been shown to provide effective guidance for understanding catalytic performance in a number of systems, as the adsorbate binding strength (and by extension the d-band center) can be correlated with its activation on the metal surface."
[7] "In plots of the d-bands of Pd, Pd in PdZn, and Pt, it is evident in Figure 1 that although Pt and PdZn may have similar d-band centers, the presence of Zn results in both a shift and a narrowing of the density of states with nearly complete depletion of d-electron density near the Fermi level, demonstrating a large electronic modification from the alloying event."
[8] "Critical deviations between scaling of the d-band center with OH and CH adsorption can be accounted for by evaluating the additional terms, and new correlative relations can be developed."
[9] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."
[10] "Intermetallic compounds lend themselves well to changing adsorbate configuration."
[11] "Knowledge of the precise atomic locations also lends study of intermetallic surfaces to theoretical examination."
[12] "While formation of an intermetallic phase is often speculated rather than proven in supported nanoparticle catalysis, the rich phase diagram allows, in principle, the tuning of the ensemble size to some degree to perturb adsorbate geometry."
[13] "For example, Table 1 shows a group of PtSn surfaces that have been examined using density functional theory, showing the switch from di-σ-bonded C2H4 to π-bonded C2H4 as the tin content increases."
[14] "Similarly, only a very small amount of Sn dramatically decreases the binding strength of toluene due to the disturbance of the proper ensemble for adsorption of the aromatic ring."

To exploit the synergistic influence of geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys for enhancing catalytic performance, innovative strategies can be developed focusing on the interplay between these effects. By creating alloys that specifically tune the electronic structure and bonding configurations, it is possible to manipulate the adsorbate interaction strengths and geometric configurations, leading to more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. This approach can surpass traditional monometallic catalysts by allowing for precise control over reaction pathways and product distributions. Key strategies include the use of intermetallic compounds, single-atom alloys, and coadsorbed structural modifiers to alter the adsorbate configuration, thus breaking the correlations between reactivity and electronic structure observed in monometallic catalysts.
