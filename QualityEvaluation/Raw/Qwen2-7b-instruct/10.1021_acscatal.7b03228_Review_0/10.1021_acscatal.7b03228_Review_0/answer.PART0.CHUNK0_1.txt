[1] "The intrinsic complexity of these systems allows us to better tailor reaction selectivity and to tune the reactivity of one metal by the presence of another."
[2] "For the purposes of this Viewpoint, the term electronic effect will refer to the strength of an adsorbate interaction with the metal surface, while a geometric effect refers to the bonding configuration."
[3] "It should be noted the electronic structure of the alloying element also shifts in response to the alloying event (in this case the d-band center of Pt shifts from 2.55 to 2.34 eV)."
[4] "Critical deviations between scaling of the d-band center with OH and CH adsorption can be accounted for by evaluating the additional terms, and new correlative relations can be developed."
[5] "In order to break from these relationships, the bonding configuration of the adsorbate must be perturbed (in contrast to only changing the strength of adsorbate binding)."

To develop more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems that surpass traditional monometallic catalysts, we must leverage the synergy between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys. By manipulating the spatial arrangement and bonding configurations of metal atoms, intermetallic compounds and single-atom alloys can alter the adsorbate geometry. This approach enables a more nuanced control over catalytic activity, allowing for the optimization of selectivity beyond what is achievable with electronic modifications alone. Innovative strategies focusing on the precise engineering of adsorbate configurations in alloy surfaces can lead to catalytic systems with enhanced performance, tailored to specific reaction pathways.
