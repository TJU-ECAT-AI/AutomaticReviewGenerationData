[1] "The tetragonal distortion of the CsCl type of structure towards the CuAu type of structure has been subject of debate over several decades."
[2] "The reasons for the tetragonal distortion are visualized by the analysis of the electron localizability indicator for both structural motifs (Figure 4, middle and bottom)."

1. Geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys can synergistically influence catalytic performance. The tetragonal distortion in ZnPd, for instance, is influenced by both geometric factors, such as the atomic sizes and the preferred heteroatomic interactions, and electronic factors, including charge transfer and direct PdPd bonding interactions.
