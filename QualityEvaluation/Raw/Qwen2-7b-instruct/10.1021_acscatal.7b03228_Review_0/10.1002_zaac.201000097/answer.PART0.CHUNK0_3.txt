The tetragonal distortion in ZnPd is primarily driven by the direct Pd-Pd bonding within the (001) plane. This is evidenced by the electron localizability indicator (ELI) analysis, which shows that the penultimate shell of palladium is significantly structured in the (001) plane, with small maxima between the palladium atoms along [100]. In contrast, the structuring in cubic ZnPd is less pronounced, and no maxima in ELI-D were found between the palladium atoms, indicating that direct Pd-Pd bonding is the main cause of the tetragonal distortion in the cubic structure.

ZnPd的四角畸变主要由（001）平面内的Pd-Pd键驱动。通过电子局部化指标（ELI）分析，可以观察到钯的最后一个壳层在（001）平面中显著结构化，并且沿着[100]方向在钯原子之间存在小的最大值。相比之下，立方ZnPd中的结构化程度较低，并且未在钯原子之间发现ELI-D的最大值，这表明直接Pd-Pd键是立方结构中四角畸变的主要原因。
