[1] "The intermetallic compound PdZn was reported to have two modifications, the tetragonal CuAu-type low-temperature phase and the cubic CsCl-type high-temperature phase."
[2] "Analysis of the chemical bonding applying the electron localizability approach reveals charge transfer from zinc to palladium and proves direct PdPd interactions in the (001) plane to be the main reason for the tetragonal distortion of the cubic CsCl-type structural pattern for ZnPd."
[3] "The reasons for the tetragonal distortion are visualized by the analysis of the electron localizability indicator for both structural motifs (Figure 4, middle and bottom)."

The geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, such as charge transfer and direct PdPd interactions, synergistically influence catalytic performance. In the context of the binary system Pd-Zn, the analysis of chemical bonding using the electron localizability approach revealed charge transfer from zinc to palladium, which justifies the formula ZnPd. Direct PdPd interactions in the (001) plane are the primary reason for the tetragonal distortion of cubic ZnPd. This interplay suggests that the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems can be enhanced by exploiting the synergistic effects of geometric and electronic influences in transition-metal alloys.

在过渡金属合金中，如电荷转移和直接PdPd相互作用，几何和电子效应协同影响催化性能。在Pd-Zn二元体系中，通过电子局部化方法分析化学键，揭示了锌到钯的电荷转移，这支持了ZnPd的命名方式。在立方ZnPd中，(001)平面内的直接PdPd相互作用是四面体扭曲的主要原因。这种相互作用表明，通过利用过渡金属合金中几何和电子效应的协同作用，可以增强设计更高效、选择性和可调性的催化系统的方法。
