[1] "The existence of the cubic high-temperature phase of equia- tomic composition in the binary system Pd-Zn could not be proven experimentally and remains uncertain."
[2] "Analysis of the chemical bonding applying the electron localizability approach revealed the charge transfer from zinc to palladium, thus justifying the formula ZnPd instead of PdZn."
[3] "Direct PdPd interactions in the (001) plane were shown to be the main reason for the tetragonal distortion of cubic ZnPd."

The interplay between geometric and electronic effects in transition-metal alloys, such as the binary system Pd-Zn, can significantly impact catalytic performance. Geometrically, the arrangement of atoms in the alloy structure influences its surface area, porosity, and connectivity, which are critical factors for adsorption and reaction rates. Electronically, the distribution of electrons across the metal atoms affects the reactivity, selectivity, and stability of the catalyst. The synergy between these effects can lead to the design of more efficient, selective, and tunable catalytic systems. Innovative strategies might involve the creation of new alloy compositions, the introduction of dopants, or the use of surface engineering techniques to optimize the balance between geometric and electronic properties. This can result in catalysts that outperform traditional monometallic catalysts, potentially enhancing the yield and efficiency of chemical reactions.
