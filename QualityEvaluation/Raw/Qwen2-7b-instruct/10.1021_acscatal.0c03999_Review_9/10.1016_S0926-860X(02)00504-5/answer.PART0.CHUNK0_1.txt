[1] "Zeolite ZSM-5 of Si/Al ratio from 14 to 100, modified with transition metal ions (Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+) introduced by means of ionic exchange, showed catalytic activity for propane oxidation already at 330 C."
[2] "The use of air as oxidant resulted mainly in carbon oxides, while application of N2O led to high selectivity towards propene."
[3] "Thermal treatment of modified zeolites was a crucial parameter influencing an oxidative activity of the samples."
[4] "High activity for propane oxydehydrogenation was found for samples calcined at 900 C, while the calcination at lower temperature (600 C) resulted in negligible propane conversion."
[5] "Presence of MFI structure appeared indispensable for the formation of active transition metal complexes, while Si/Al ratio influenced activity and selectivity of catalysts less significantly."
[6] "Iron modified zeolite ZSM-5 shows the best catalytic performance for propane oxydehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "The activity of transition metal modified zeolite ZSM-5 increases significantly with the increase in the calcination temperature."

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 
2. Under N2O-assisted conditions, the use of iron-modified ZSM-5 zeolites shows the best catalytic performance for the ODHP reaction, with high selectivity towards propene formation. 
3. The catalytic activity of the iron-modified ZSM-5 zeolites increases significantly with the increase in calcination temperature, indicating that thermal treatment is a crucial factor influencing their oxidative activity.
