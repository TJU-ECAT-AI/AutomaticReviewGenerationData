1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, display noticeable catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction at 330°C. The use of N2O as an oxidant enhances the selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Iron-modified zeolite ZSM-5 demonstrates the best catalytic performance for the ODHP reaction. The activity of transition metal-modified zeolite ZSM-5 significantly increases with the increase in the calcination temperature.
