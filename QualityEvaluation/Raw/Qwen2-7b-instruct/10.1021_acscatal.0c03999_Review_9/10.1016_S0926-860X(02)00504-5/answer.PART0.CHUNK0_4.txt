[1] "Zeolite ZSM-5 of Si/Al ratio from 14 to 100, modified with transition metal ions (Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+) introduced by means of ionic exchange, showed catalytic activity for propane oxidation already at 330 C."
[2] "The use of N2O as an oxidant led to very high selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene."
[3] "Iron modified zeolite ZSM-5 showed the best catalytic performance for the oxidation reaction."
[4] "The activity of transition metal modified zeolite ZSM-5 increased significantly with the increase in the calcination temperature."

1. Transition metal-modified zeolite ZSM-5, including those modified with iron (Fe3+), manganese (Mn2+), and cobalt (Co2+) ions, demonstrated catalytic activity for propane oxidation at 330°C.
2. When nitrogen dioxide (N2O) was utilized as an oxidant, there was a high selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene.
3. Iron-modified zeolite ZSM-5 exhibited the most effective catalytic performance for the oxidation process.
4. The catalytic activity of transition metal-modified zeolite ZSM-5 increased notably with an increase in the calcination temperature.
