<quotes>
[1] "Zeolite ZSM-5 of Si/Al ratio from 14 to 100, modified with transition metal ions (Fe3+, Mn2+, Co2+) introduced by means of ionic exchange, showed catalytic activity for propane oxidation already at 330 C."
[2] "The use of air as oxidant resulted mainly in carbon oxides, while application of N2O led to high selectivity towards propene."
[3] "Thermal treatment of modified zeolites was a crucial parameter influencing an oxidative activity of the samples."
[4] "High activity for propane oxydehydrogenation was found for samples calcined at 900 C, while the calcination at lower temperature (600 C) resulted in negligible propane conversion."
[5] "Presence of MFI structure appeared indispensable for the formation of active transition metal complexes, while Si/Al ratio influenced activity and selectivity of catalysts less significantly."
[6] "Iron modified zeolite ZSM-5 shows the best catalytic performance for propane oxydehydrogenation reaction."
[7] "The activity of transition metal modified zeolite ZSM-5 increases significantly with the increase in the calcination temperature."
