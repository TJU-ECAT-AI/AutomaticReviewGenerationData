Physicochemical characteristics of isomorphously substituted
FeZSM-5 both after preparation and after activation have been
determined by gas (Ar and N2) physisorption, 27Al and 29Si magic-
angle spinning–nuclear magnetic resonance, NH3 temperature-
programmed desorption, transmission electron microscopy, H2
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), 57Fe M¨
ossbauer spec-
troscopy, and voltammetric response techniques. The activation
of as-synthesized FeZSM-5 comprises calcination at 823 K and a
subsequent steam treatment (300 mbar of H2O in N2) at 873 K.
Calcination leads to complete removal of the template. During this
process a signiﬁcant fraction of iron is dislodged to extraframe-
work positions (ca. 50%), while Al is hardly affected. Steam treat-
ment leads to signiﬁcant dealumination of the zeolite structure, the
complete extraction of isomorphously substituted iron, and the clus-
tering of extraframework iron species into highly dispersed oxide
nanoparticles of 1–2 nm, containing Fe and probably Al. Various
Fe species were identiﬁed in the ﬁnal catalyst. A large fraction of
iron in the steamed FeZSM-5 catalyst is in the form of these iron
oxide nanoparticles. No larger particles were identiﬁed. Apart from
these nanoparticles, framework iron, extraframework isolated iron
ions, and small oligonuclear oxo-iron complexes in the zeolite chan-
nels were identiﬁed by M¨
ossbauer spectroscopy and voltammetry.
Steam treatment of FeZSM-5 decreases the density and strength of
acid sites and leads to mesopore formation (around 11 nm), while
the apparent crystalline structure and morphology are not altered.
In the steamed sample, at room temperature, iron is mainly present
as Fe(III), with a fraction of Fe(II) (at least 10%). H2-TPR indicates
that the fraction of Fe(II) in the material increases up to 50% by
pretreatment in He at 623 K, by autoreduction of Fe(III) species.
The fraction of Fe(III) reduced to Fe(II) depends on the duration
of this pretreatment and appears to involve different species in the
catalyst.

INTRODUCTION
Fe-based zeolites with MFI structure, including ZSM-5
and silicalite, are receiving increasing attention in the litera-
ture. Reactions catalyzed by these materials include isomer-
izationandoxidativedehydrogenationofalkanes(1,2),and
selective oxidation of benzene to phenol using N2O as the
oxidant (3, 4). FeMFI also plays an important role in envi-
ronmental catalysis for the reduction of NOx and N2O with
hydrocarbons (HC-SCR) or ammonia (NH3-SCR) (5–12),
direct N2O decomposition (13, 14), and selective oxidation
of NH3 to N2 with O2 (15).
Various techniques have been described in the liter-
ature to characterize Fe-zeolites, including transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared,
temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), electron spin
resonance, and recently extended X-ray absorption ﬁne
structure (14, 16–23). Different forms of iron have been
identiﬁed in FeZSM-5 (Fig. 1). These include isolated ions
either (a) in framework positions (isomorphously substi-
tuted) or (b) in cationic positions in the zeolite channels,
(c)binuclearand,ingeneral,oligonuclearironcomplexesin
extraframework positions, (d) iron oxide FeOx nanoparti-
cles of size ≤2 nm, and (e) large iron oxide particles (Fe2O3)
in a wide distribution (up to 25 nm in size) located at the
surface of the zeolite crystal.
FeZSM-5 catalysts are often prepared by solid- and
liquid-ion exchange, or sublimation methods, using com-
mercial zeolites. Calcination of these materials usually leads
to the formation of a signiﬁcant fraction of large iron oxide
particles (see Fig. 1e), which are known to be inactive in the
different reactions catalyzed by FeZSM-5 (3, 6, 9, 17). Also,
ion-exchange methods often lack reproducibility (16, 24),
which makes them unattractive from a catalytic point of
view. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the
channels of H–ZSM-5 is undoubtedly a superior method
for preparing FeZSM-5. The water-free conditions under
which the exchange takes place allow full exchange of the

ZSM-5 zeolite, where iron is mainly present in the form
of binuclear hydroxide clusters at ion-exchange positions.
However, in this case, the treatments after the CVD ex-
change strongly affect the state of the iron species. Cal-
cination of the exchanged sample before a hydrolysis step
mainly leads to the formation of large iron oxide (hematite)
particles (18). The heating rate during calcination was
also found crucial in the development of these particles
(25, 26).
In an earlier paper (20), some of us reported the per-
formance of steamed FeZSM-5 for selective oxidation of
benzene to phenol with N2O, displaying high phenol pro-
ductivities (0.8 mmol of phenol · h−1 ·g−1 during 7 h time on
stream). This catalyst, hereafter denoted ex-FeZSM-5, was
prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis of isomorphously
substituted FeZSM-5, followed by calcination at 823 K and
steam treatment at 873 K. We recently reported that ex-
FeZSM-5 also yields signiﬁcantly higher N2O decomposi-
tion activity (on a per Fe basis) than catalysts prepared via
other procedures, such as liquid (aqueous)- or solid-ion ex-
change and sublimation (26, 27). Furthermore, an improved
stability for direct N2O decomposition in the presence of
O2, NO, SO2, and H2O, typically present in tail-gases from
nitric acid manufacture and combustion processes, has been
observed (26, 27).
The nature of the active Fe species of ex-FeZSM-5 in
the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol was previously in-
vestigated by some of us using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis),
X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron paramagnetic res-
onance (EPR) (20). UV–vis analysis showed that steam
treatment induces the migration of Fe to extraframework
positions, without an apparent modiﬁcation of the long-
range ordering of the crystalline structure, as concluded
from XRD. From EPR, two redox active species were iden-
tiﬁed but an unambiguous assignment of the iron species
in the catalyst could not be given. Although different au-
thors have investigated the extraction of iron from isomor-
phously substituted Fe-silicalite upon thermal treatment in
the range of 773–1073 K in air (28, 29), a detailed charac-
terization of the activation of the FeZSM-5 and nature of
the species formed by the steaming procedure has not been
reported.
In this paper, a detailed characterization of the activation
of isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5 by calcination and
steaming is presented, based on gas (Ar, N2) physisorp-
tion, 27Al and 29Si magic-angle spinning (MAS)–nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), TEM, NH3 temperature-
programmed desorption (TPD), H2-TPR, 57Fe M¨
ossbauer
spectroscopy, and voltammetric response techniques. The
results lead to a detailed description of the physicochemical
changes induced by the postsynthesis treatments, as well as
of the nature of the different species in the catalysts.
EXPERIMENTAL
Material Preparation
The isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5 was synthe-
sized hydrothermally using tetrapropylammonium hydrox-
ide as the template (20). A solution of the silica source
(tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS, Acros, 98%), the template
(tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, TPAOH, Fluka, 20% in
water),andNaOHwasaddedtoamixtureofaluminum(III)
nitrate (Al(NO3)3 · 9H2O, Merck, 99%) and iron(III) ni-
trate (Fe(NO3)3 · 9H2O, Merck, 98.5%). The molar ratios
between components were H2O/Si = 45, TPAOH/Si = 0.1,
NaOH/Si = 0.2, Si/Al = 36, and Si/Fe = 152. The solution
was transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave lined with
Teﬂon and kept in a static air oven at 448 K for 5 days.
The crystalline material was ﬁltered and washed with
deionized water until the sample was free of nitrates. The
as-synthesized sample (FeZSM-5as), in which Fe(III) is
isomorphously substituted in the zeolite framework, was
calcined in air at 823 K for 10 h and was then converted
into the H-form by three consecutive exchanges with an
ammonium nitrate solution (0.1 M) overnight and subse-
quent calcination at 823 K for 5 h (FeZSM-5c). Finally,
the catalyst was steamed at ambient pressure (water par-
tial pressure of 300 mbar and 30 ml · min−1 of N2 ﬂow) at
873 K during 5 h, yielding ex-FeZSM-5. The sample was
stored at room temperature in dry atmosphere.
In order to perform 57Fe M¨
ossbauer measurements with
the different samples, 57Fe-enriched FeZSM-5as was pre-
pared. For this purpose, a small piece of 57Fe foil was
dissolved in concentrated nitric acid (1 M). Subsequently,
ammonium hydroxide was added to neutralize the solution,
followed by addition of the aluminum source. The synthesis
and postsynthesis treatments were as described above.

Characterization
The chemical composition of the catalysts was determi-
nedbyinductivelycoupledplasmaopticalemissionspectro-
scopy (Perkin–Elmer Plasma 40 (Si) and Optima 3000DV
(axial)) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer
1100).
Ar adsorption isotherms at 87 K were obtained in a Mi-
cromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus. The pore size distri-
bution was calculated from the adsorption branch of the
isothermusingtheSaito–Foleymodel(30).N2 adsorptionat
77 K was carried out in a QuantaChrome Autosorb-6B ap-
paratus. The pore size distribution was calculated from the
desorption branch of the isotherm using the Barret–Joyner–
Halenda model (31). Samples were previously evacuated at
623 K for 16 h. The BET method was used to calculate the
surface area (SBET) of the samples, while the micropore
volume (Vmicro) and external surface area (ESA) were de-
termined using the t-plot method according to Lippens and
de Boer (32).
29Si and 27Al MAS–NMR were recorded at 79.46 and
104.26 MHz, respectively, with a Varian VXR-400S spec-
trometer. The narrow-bore magnet (50 nm) was ﬁtted with
a high-speed magic spinning (MAS) Doty probe. The sam-
ples were spun in 5-mm-diameter rotors made of zirconia.
The length of the radio frequency pulses was 3.1 µs for Si
and 0.5 µs for Al. The spinning frequency was in the range
4–4.5 kHz for Si and 7.0 kHz for Al. Acquisition time was
0.05 s for Si and 0.2 s for Al. A time interval of 5 s for Si and
1 s for Al between successive accumulations was selected in
order to avoid saturation effects. The number of accumula-
tions (688 for Si and 10,000 for Al) allowed a signal-to-noise
ratio higher than 20. The 27Al and 29Si chemical shifts were
referenced to Al(H2O)3+
6
and Si(CH3)4, respectively.
Temperature-programmed
desorption
of
ammonia
(NH3-TPD) measurements were carried out on a Micro-
meritics TPR/TPD 2900 equipped with a thermal conduc-
tivity detector (TCD). The sample (40 mg) was pretreated
at 723 K in He (50 ml · min−1) for 1 h. Afterward, NH3
(40 ml · min−1) was adsorbed at 473 K. After 15 min of
adsorbing NH3 a ﬂow of He (50 ml · min−1) was passed
through the reactor over the course of 30 min to remove
weakly adsorbed NH3 on the catalyst surface. This pro-
cedure was repeated three times. Desorption of NH3 was
monitored in the range of 473–873 K at 10 K · min−1.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried
out on a Philips CM 30 T electron microscope with a LaB6
ﬁlament as the source of electrons operated at 300 kV. Sam-
ples were mounted on a copper-supported carbon polymer
grid by placing a few droplets of a suspension of ground
sample in ethanol on the grid, followed by drying at am-
bient conditions. In order to enhance the visibility of the
small particles, the zeolites were amorphized by the elec-
tron beam. This process did not induce sintering of iron
oxide particles in the specimen.
Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was per-
formed in a home-made ﬁxed-bed reactor (4-mm inner di-
ameter) setup, using a high-purity mixture of 7.7 vol% H2
in Ar to reduce samples in the temperature range of 298–
1273 K. Copper(II) oxide was used for calibration. The sam-
ple mass was diluted with SiC (volumetric ratio 1 : 1) in or-
der to improve heat transfer in the catalyst bed. The follow-
ing procedure was applied: (i) heating in He (or 10 vol%
N2O in He) at 623 K for 2 or 15 h, (ii) cooling to room
temperature in the same gas, (iii) ﬂushing with He over the
course of 1 h at room temperature (in the case of N2O pre-
treatment), and (iv) switching to the reductive H2 in the
Ar mixture and starting the temperature program (heat-
ing rate, 10 K · min−1). A fresh sample was used for each
H2-TPR experiment. The gas at the reactor exit was passed
through a membrane drier to remove vapors and condens-
able gases before entering the TCD.
57Fe M¨
ossbauer spectra were measured on a constant
acceleration spectrometer in a triangular mode with a
57Co : Rh source. Spectra for the different FeZSM-5 sam-
ples were obtained at 300, 77, and 4.2 K. The overall spec-
tra were deconvoluted with calculated M¨
ossbauer spectra
that consisted of Lorentzian-shaped lines. In the case of
quadrupole doublets the line widths and the absorption ar-
eas of the constituent lines were constrained equally. Posi-
tional parameters were not constrained in the ﬁtting pro-
cedure. Isomer shift values are reported relative to sodium
nitroprusside. The accuracy of the positional parameters is
±0.03 mm · s−1.
The voltammetric response of graphite–polyester com-
posite electrodes (GPCEs) modiﬁed by FeZSM-5 samples
was measured in a standard three-electrode arrangement
with a platinum auxiliary electrode and a saturated calomel
reference electrode (SCE). Preparation of the composite
electrode and modiﬁcation by FeZSM-5 have been descri-
bed elsewhere (33). Linear scan voltammograms (LSVs)
and differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs) were
recorded at a potential scan rate (ν) of 20 mV · s−1 and
pulse amplitude (U) of 80 mV using a Metrohm E506
Polarecord. Experiments were performed at 298 K in
aqueous solutions of 0.1–1.0 M HCl (supporting elec-
trolyte) under argon atmosphere. Hematite (Fe2O3, Fluka,
98%), goethite (FeO(OH), Fluka, 98%), and FeCl3 · 6H2O
(Aldrich, >99%) were used as reference materials.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Chemical Composition
The elemental analysis of the as-synthesized, calcined,
and steamed FeZSM-5 samples prepared in this study is
summarized in Table 1. Comparison of the composition of
the gels and the crystalline samples suggests that all the
iron and aluminum is present in the solid, while a small part
of the silicon is not incorporated. Only minor differences

samples can be observed. The concentration of Na in the
calcined and steamed FeZSM-5 is below detection limits.
The color changes caused by the postsynthesis treatments
(especially steaming) can be nicely followed by the naked
eye. The as-synthesized and calcined samples were white

Gas (Ar and N2) Physisorption
Ar adsorption at 87 K was carried out to investigate
changes in the microporosity of FeZSM-5 before and after
steam treatment. The micropore size distribution of
FeZSM-5c shows a well-deﬁned peak at 0.56 nm (p/p0 =
10−5) (Fig. 2a), characteristic of the channels in the MFI

structure. By steaming, a bimodal distribution is apparently
obtained (at 0.56 and 0.8 nm). The intensity of the peak at
0.56 nm diminishes in ex-FeZSM-5 compared to FeZSM-
5c, and the peak at 0.8 nm develops. This suggests disap-
pearance of micropores, which is conﬁrmed by the cumu-
lative curve. This is in agreement with the slightly lower
speciﬁc surface area SBET of the steamed sample (Table 1).
Llewellyn et al. (34) explained by isothermal volumetry,
microcalorimetry, and neutron diffraction techniques on
silicalite-1 that the relatively sharp peak centered at 0.8 nm
(p/p0 = 10−3) is an artifact, caused by the transition of Ar
molecules from a disordered phase (presumably a ﬂuid) to
a crystalline-like solid phase at the corresponding relative
pressure. The appearance of this transition depends on the
Si/Al ratio in the sample (35). It is proposed that a high-
framework Si/Al ratio (Si/Al > 23) leads to a more homo-
geneous energetic state of the zeolite surface toward Ar ad-
sorption (34, 35). The presence of the artifact is therefore an
indication that dealumination of the zeolite framework has
occurred.
The mesopore size distribution derived from the des-
orption branch of the N2 isotherm of FeZSM-5c and ex-
FeZSM-5 (Fig. 2b) shows different contributions. A broad
peak centered at around 11 nm is identiﬁed in ex-FeZSM-
5, which suggests the formation of mesopores, leading to
a signiﬁcant increase in the ESA (Table 1) by creation of
intercrystalline voids. Scanning electron micrographs of the
as-synthesized, calcined, and steamed FeZSM-5 samples
showed no change in crystal morphology during the post-
synthesis treatments (20). As a consequence of mesopore
formation, the micropore volume and the total pore vol-
ume in the steamed sample are slightly lower than in the
calcined sample. This should be related to the presence of
the generated extraframework species (mainly Al) in the
ACTIVATION OF FeZSM-5

channels of the zeolite, inducing pore blockage. The meso-
pores are likely to be formed as a consequence of the ex-
traction of Al and Fe in the steaming procedure from frame-
work positions. This leads to lattice defects, which can be
restored with Si atoms coming from external parts of the
zeolite crystal (36). As a result, the framework becomes
more siliceous and adjacent cages become interconnected
through removal of Si from the least stable parts of the lat-
tice. A local character of this process is inferred by XRD
results (20) showing no change in the crystal structure of
the calcined and steamed samples.
The peak at 3.9 nm (p/p0 = 0.45) is also an artifact,
attributed to the tensile strength effect of the liquid N2
adsorbate at 77 K during desorption (37). The pore size
distribution in the range of pore sizes from 2 to 3.9 nm dif-
fers in the calcined and steamed materials. The sharp peak
at 2 nm in the steamed sample, which is less pronounced in
the calcined sample, is considered to be the equivalent arti-
fact observed in the Ar adsorption measurements at 0.8 nm
(p/p0 = 10−3) (38).
27Al and 29Si MAS–NMR Spectroscopy
27Al and 29Si MAS–NMR spectroscopy were carried out
to investigate changes in the coordination of the atoms in
the zeolite framework on calcination and steaming. The
27Al MAS–NMR spectra of FeZSM-5as and FeZSM-5c
(Figs. 3a and 3b) exhibit a sharp resonance at 55 ppm,
assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated Al atoms in lattice
positions (39). In general, the intensities of the signals in
FIG. 3.

the NMR spectra are lower than is typically observed for
ZSM-5 containing only Al and Si, as a direct consequence of
the paramagnetism of the Fe ions, whose unpaired electrons
generate a local magnetic ﬁeld that strongly perturbs the
resonance of the 27Al nuclei. The peaks at −5 and 105 ppm
are spinning side bands due to quadrupole interactions of
27Al nuclei. The intensity of the peak at −5 ppm is larger
than the spinning band at 105 ppm, suggesting the pres-
ence of another signal caused by small amounts of Al in
extraframework positions.
Calcination of FeZSM-5as hardly affects the 27Al MAS–
NMR spectrum, in agreement with previous dealumination
studies on ZSM-5 zeolites (40). Steam treatment leads to
dealumination of the zeolite framework by migration of
Al(III) to extraframework positions. In the 27Al MAS–
NMR spectrum of ex-FeZSM-5 (Fig. 3c), the resonance
around 55 ppm signiﬁcantly decreases and a broad band
centered around −3 ppm appears, with a shoulder at ap-
proximately 30 ppm. The peak at −3 ppm is attributed to
hexacoordinated Al species in octahedral positions (39),
while the shoulder at 30 ppm indicates pentacoordinated or
highly distorted tetrahedral Al species (41, 42). The broad-
ening of this signal is probably due to the presence of ex-
traframework Al with different coordination and positions
in ex-FeZSM-5. In view of the spectra acquired, the de-
gree of dealumination is difﬁcult to quantify. From the rel-
ative ratio of intensities of the signals at 55 and −3 ppm in
the 27Al NMR spectra (I55 + I−3/I55), it was roughly esti-
mated that ∼30–40% of framework aluminum is dislodged
to extraframework positions by the steam treatment. Dif-
ferent extraframework Al species have been considered to
be present in zeolite catalysts (36). Which of these species is
actually formed on dealumination cannot be assessed from
these NMR spectra.
The 29Si MAS–NMR spectra of the as-synthesized and
calcined samples (Figs. 4a and 4b) show a broad signal with
a maximum at −117 ppm and a shoulder around −120 ppm,
corresponding to Si(0Al), and a weak signal at −109 ppm
attributed to Si(1Al) (39). The shoulder at −100 ppm, nor-
mally attributed to Si(2Al), was not observed in our spec-
tra, indicating a highly dispersed state of Al in the zeo-
lite framework. Dealumination of the calcined sample on
steaming is indirectly conﬁrmed by the decrease in the sig-
nal at −109 ppm in the 29Si MAS–NMR spectrum (Fig. 4c),
indicating the absence of Si nuclei coordinated to alu-
minum after the dislodgment of Al to extraframework posi-
tions.
NH3-TPD
Steam treatment of FeZSM-5c also induces changes in
the acidity of the catalyst, as shown by NH3-TPD (Fig. 5).
The two NH3 desorption peaks identiﬁed in FeZSM-5c
(at 540 and 725 K, Fig. 5a) are indicative of the pres-
ence of acidic centers of different strength. According to

the literature, the low-temperature peak corresponds to
weaklyacidicsitesandthehigh-temperaturepeak(>673K)
to strong sites (22, 43). The strength and number of the
acidic sites decrease after the steam treatment, indicat-
ing that most of the acidic centers in the calcined sam-
ple may be Brønsted acids and arise from the presence
of Al and Fe in the framework. The acidic centers in
the steamed sample show a broad distribution (at 675 K,
Fig. 5b).

TEM Analysis
TEM was used to analyze the extraction of the Fe ions
from the zeolite lattice on calcination and steam treatment.
The TEM micrograph of FeZSM-5as does not show any
iron-related phase (Fig. 6a), suggesting that all the Fe(III)
is present in a highly dispersed state at isolated positions in
the zeolite framework of the as-synthesized material. Cal-
cination of FeZSM-5as to yield FeZSM-5c extracts some
isomorphously substituted Fe to extraframework positions,
as concluded from the presence of small iron oxide particles
in the TEM micrograph of FeZSM-5c (Fig. 6b). Steam treat-
ment massively dislodges iron to extraframework positions,
inducing the formation of homogeneously dispersed iron
oxide nanoparticles of 1–2 nm (Fig. 6c). The extraframe-
work Al species generated during steam treatment might
play a role in the formation of the iron oxide. Marturano
et al. (24) reported that since Fe and Al oxide compounds
have similar structural properties, it can be envisaged that
the presence of extraframework Al species might induce
the epitaxial growth of the Fe oxides. Following this rea-
soning, it is likely that the observed particles also contain
extraframework Al species. In principle, due to the size of
the nanoparticles, they should be present at the external
surface of the zeolite crystal. However, the local formation
of mesopores of 11 nm identiﬁed by N2 adsorption makes
the presence of this species in the porous network of the

fraction of framework Fe(III), which is hard to reduce (28).
It is well-known that framework iron is more difﬁcult to
reduce than iron in extraframework positions. The temper-
ature difference observed for the two peaks is indicative

of a great shielding effect of the zeolite framework, which
protects framework Fe(III) from reaction with hydrogen.
The H2/Fe ratio in the He-pretreated sample was 0.38.
When the sample was pretreated in N2O at 623 K the
H2/Fe ratio increased to 0.52 (Fig. 7b), which corresponds
to the theoretical value (0.5) to reduce all Fe(III) to Fe(II)
in the sample:
2FeIIIOx + H2 →2FeIIOx−1 + H2O.
Comparing both pretreatments, the area of the ﬁrst re-
duction peak increases after the N2O pretreatment, while
the second reduction peak hardly changes compared to
the sample pretreated in He. This indicates that a sig-
niﬁcant amount (∼25%) of exclusively the Fe species
in extraframework positions is in the Fe(II) oxidation
state after calcination at 823 K and pretreatment in He at
623 K.
Lobree et al. (44) have shown that the oxidation state and
the nature of the iron species in a sublimed FeZSM-5 cata-
lyst depends on the iron content of the zeolite and the pre-
treatment. Iron was found as Fe(III) in cationic positions
as Fe3+(OH−)2 for molar ratios of Fe/Al < 0.19, whereas
above this level the reduction of a fraction of Fe(III) to
Fe(II) occurred. Additionally at Fe/Al > 0.56, iron is also
present as particles of FeOx. The formation of Fe(II) is ex-
plained by autoreduction of the Fe3+(OH−)2 species, which
are located in highly reducible α sites in ZSM-5 (in the 10-
membered ring channel). The autoreduction of FeMFI, i.e.,
the facile interconversion between Fe(III) and Fe(II) in the
zeolite on thermal treatment (>523 K) in inert or vacuum,
has been reported by several authors (16, 44–46). The au-
toreduction process involves release of molecular oxygen
and dehydration of initially present [FeIII(OH)2]+Z−, lead-
ing to [FeII(OH)]+Z−, where Z is the zeolite. It is likely
that the autoreduction process has also occurred in our
calcined sample. From the ratio of the areas of the H2
consumption peaks (in the N2O pretreated catalyst) it is
estimated that ∼50–60% of the framework iron in the as-
synthesized material is already extracted by the calcination
procedure. This value is higher than previously reported
for Fe-silicalite (28), where 20–25% of framework iron was
extracted on thermal treatment of the as-synthesized sam-
ple in air at 773 K. This difference can be explained by the
milder thermal treatment carried out in (28) (773 vs 823 K)
and by the fact that isomorphously substituted Fe in sili-
calite is more stable than in ZSM-5. Analogously, isomor-
phously substituted Fe in the ZSM-5 framework is less sta-
ble than Al (47) and thus substantial extraction of iron takes
place on calcination, while all Al remains in framework
positions.
In the steamed FeZSM-5 the peak at high temperatures is
not present, indicating the absence of framework Fe species
in this material. The total H2/Fe ratio in ex-FeZSM-5 pre-
treated in He at 623 K for 2 h was 0.23 (Fig. 7c), which
indicates the presence of ∼50% of the iron as Fe(II). Pre-
treatment of the sample in N2O leads to a similar pattern
(Fig. 7d), with a molar H2/Fe ratio = 0.47, close to the
theoretical value for reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II). To ex-
plain the low H2/Fe ratio observed in the TPR proﬁles of
ex-FeZSM5 after He pretreatment, it can again be assumed
that a signiﬁcant fraction of iron in the sample is already
present as Fe(II), suggesting autoreduction in the He pre-
treatment. The pretreatment of the steamed sample in He
for 15 h leads to a lower H2 consumption (H2/Fe ∼0.15),
which indicates a clear dependence of the amount of re-
duced Fe(II) species on the time of the treatment. From the
TPR experiments it cannot be assessed accurately whether
all Fe(II) in the pretreated samples is caused by autoreduc-
tion or if some already exists in the freshly steamed sample
(generated on steam treatment). This point will be further
addressed by M¨
ossbauer spectroscopy. The reduction peak
appears at higher temperatures in ex-FeZSM-5 (∼815 K)
than in FeZSM-5c (∼680 K), which indicates that the iron
species formed after steaming are somehow harder to re-
duce.
An important feature of the samples investigated in this
study is their stability against reduction to Fe0. This reduc-
tion behavior has been observed in highly dispersed Fe-
zeolites, containing iron ions at cationic positions (isolated)
or small metal complexes (8, 12, 16). Partial or total reduc-
tion to metallic iron was observed when preparation routes
lead to large iron oxide particles (6, 8, 16). This was not
the case in our steamed sample, where the small size of the
iron species, including the iron oxide nanoparticles visible
in TEM, stabilizes the Fe(II) state on reduction with H2.

57Fe M¨
ossbauer Spectroscopy
57Fe M¨
ossbauer spectra of as-synthesized, calcined, and
steamed FeZSM-5 samples recorded at 300 K in air are
shown in Fig. 8. The spectrum of FeZSM-5as (Fig. 8a)
shows a broad singlet with an average isomer shift, IS =
0.52 mm · s−1, which has been assigned to tetrahedrally co-
ordinated Fe(III) ions (48). Such a broad singlet is typical
for paramagnetic iron ions with slow electron spin relax-
ation, implying large Fe–Fe distances, and thus a homoge-
neous distribution of Fe(III) ions. This is in perfect agree-
ment with framework incorporation of the iron atoms.
After calcination of the sample a considerable narrowing
of the M¨
ossbauer signal is observed together with the on-
set of a paramagnetic doublet (Fig. 8b). This is the result of
shortened electron spin relaxation times, indicating a short-
ening of the Fe–Fe distances. A likely explanation for these
shortened distances is that calcination leads to removal of
Fe(III) ions from the ZSM-5 framework. The extraframe-
work species may reside in cationic positions, form small
oligonuclear oxo-iron species, and to a minor extent cluster
in small nanoparticles, as shown in the TEM micrograph of
FeZSM-5c (Fig. 6b).
Steam treatment leading to ex-FeZSM-5 subsequently
gives rise to a well-resolved paramagnetic doublet with
an IS = 0.59 mm · s−1 and quadrupole splitting of QS =
0.90 mm · s−1 (Fig. 8c). The observation of a well-resolved
doublet indicates a further increase in electron spin relax-
ation rates and is interpreted by a continued clustering of
Fe(III) ions and small oligonuclear oxo-iron complexes into
larger particles. In addition, a small shoulder on the high-
energy line of this doublet is ﬁtted with a second doublet
with IS = 1.30 mm · s−1 and QS = 1.59 mm · s−1. The IS of
this doublet suggests that a small part of the iron is present
as Fe(II) in the steamed ex-FeZSM-5 (10% according to the
spectral ﬁtting in Table 3). This Fe(II), which is formed dur-
ing the steaming procedure, partially explains the relatively
low H2 consumption observed in TPR after He pretreat-
ment at 623 K. The remaining fraction of Fe(II) according
to H2-TPR (40% of the iron in the sample) should be there-
fore due to autoreduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) species during
He pretreatment in the H2-TPR experiments.
In order to obtain additional information about the parti-
cle size distribution of the iron oxide nanoparticles formed
on steam treatment, as well as the oxidation state of the iron
atoms in ex-FeZSM-5, additional 57Fe M¨
ossbauer spectra
were recorded at 300, 77, and 4.2 K applying high vacuum
(Fig. 9). Spectral parameters derived from these measure-
ments are presented in Table 3. Two differences can be ob-
served in the 57Fe M¨
ossbauer spectra recorded at 300 K
at ambient pressure in air and under high vacuum, re-
spectively (Figs. 8c and 9a): in high vacuum an increased
quadrupole splitting of the Fe(II) doublet can be observed,
as well as a new broad spectral component with a contribu-
tion of 19%. The increased QS = 2.99 mm · s−1 of the same
Fe(II) species (QS = 1.59 mm · s−1 in air and with the same
spectral contribution; see Table 3) can be explained by the
removal of physisorbed water molecules on evacuation. A
justiﬁcation for this explanation is that reexposure of the
evacuated ex-FeZSM-5 to ambient air results in a similar
M¨
ossbauer spectrum, as presented in Fig. 8c. However, this
similarity is observed only after prolonged exposure times

(24 h). We explain this slow change as the uptake of water
by a slow diffusional process rather than as due to chemical
oxidation with molecular oxygen. The latter process should
take place at a much faster pace.
The broad singlet with an estimated IS = 1.15 mm · s−1
can be assigned as follows. Since a fully developed sex-
tuplet is not observed in the spectrum at 77 K (Fig. 9b),
it is not conceivable that the observed broad component
at 300 K is caused by superparamagnetic iron oxide par-
ticles, which are close to the superparamagnetic transition
temperature (49). More likely, this spectral component is
due to isolated Fe3+ ions with slow electron spin relaxation
times. Because of the absence of such a component in the
spectrum recorded under ambient conditions in air, we be-
lieve that these isolated iron atoms reside in extraframe-
work positions. In these positions, the iron atoms are much
more affected by the removal of water as a result of the
vacuum treatment than when they would be isomorphously
substituted. The presence of water in the pores of the zeo-
lite will lead to a mobility of the extraframework iron ions,
which makes them invisible for the M¨
ossbauer technique.
Water removal by evacuation leads to increased interac-
tions between these cationic iron species and the zeolite
framework.
Several observations have been made which favor this ar-
gument. First, a strong increase in total resonant absorption
area is observed after exposure of the ex-FeZSM-5 material
to high vacuum. From this, it is deduced that the iron species
responsible for this broad component does not absorb
resonantly when the material is in contact with air, implying
that this iron species is invisible under these conditions. Sec-
ond, similar to the disappearance of the Fe(II) component,
this broad spectral component slowly fades away on reex-
posure of this evacuated material to air, thereby illustrating
the role of water on this reversible process.
The M¨
ossbauer spectrum at 77 K shows the presence of
the broad component more prominently, which now also
contains the onset of a six-line pattern: a high-spin Fe(III)
doublet and two Fe(II) components (Fig. 9b). Although
the onset of a six-line pattern clearly indicates slow elec-
tron spin relaxation (thus that this component has mag-
netic character), the assignment of this spectral component
is ambiguous. Under the assumption that the broad spectral
component observed in the M¨
ossbauer spectrum at 300 K
and high vacuum is caused by isolated paramagnetic Fe(III)
ions in extraframework positions, it is obvious that this mag-
netic component is also produced by these iron species.
However, since TEM revealed the presence of iron oxide
nanoparticles (1–2 nm) this component could be the re-
sult of superparamagnetic behavior. This is in agreement
with the fact that the spectral contribution of this mag-
netic component in the M¨
ossbauer spectrum recorded at
77 K has grown partly at the expense of the Fe(III) dou-
blet (see Table 3). At 4.2 K, the magnetic component has
developed into a full-grown sextuplet (see Fig. 9c). The
spectral contribution of this component has grown to ca.
60% of the total spectral area, again mainly at the expense
of the Fe(III) doublet (see Table 3). This is now a clear indi-
cation that the iron oxide nanoparticles show superparam-
agnetic behavior. Broad lines of the sextuplet may suggest
an amorphous character of the nanoparticles, with a lower
hyperﬁne ﬁeld (48.8 T) than in α-Fe2O3 (typically 50.2 T).
If it is assumed that the broad spectral component in the
M¨
ossbauer spectrum recorded at 77 K and with a spectral
contribution of 29% is predominantly caused by isolated
paramagnetic iron atoms, a particle size close to 2 nm can be
estimated for these superparamagnetic iron oxide particles.
Additionally, it would mean that the magnetic contribution
in the M¨
ossbauer spectrum recorded at 4.2 Kis composed of
two components, i.e., isolated extraframework iron atoms
and iron oxide particles of ca. 2 nm in size, the so-called
nanoparticles. It is mentioned in M¨
ossbauer studies by Calis
et al. (50) on calcined FeZSM-5 samples and, more recently,
by Ovanesyan et al. (51) on a FeZSM-5 zeolite comparable
to that described here that magnetic contributions from iso-
lated paramagnetic iron atoms and superparamagnetic iron
oxide particles with slow electron spin relaxation have simi-
lar magnetic hyperﬁne splitting and therefore could largely
overlap. Indeed, this result is in excellent agreement with
previous research on this catalytic system using EPR spec-
troscopy. In that case the presence of isolated Fe3+ ions
in cationic positions was conﬁrmed by the appearance of a

ossbauer
spectrum recorded at 77 K, two Fe(II) components can be
discriminated in the spectrum recorded at 4.2 K, although
the nature of these Fe(II) sites is at present not clear.
Voltammetric Response
Comparison of electrochemical response of the zeolites
during different preparation stages provides valuable in-
formation about the disappearance and appearance of dis-
tinctive electroactive iron species in the samples. Some of
us have recently reported the characterization of steamed
FeZSM-5 using Paraloid B72 ﬁlm electrodes, based on
the preparation method of the electrode, the shape of the
voltammetric curves, and the dependence of the peak po-
tentials with the pH of the supporting electrolyte and the
potential scan rate (52). Although the electron transfer to
electroactivespeciesinzeoliteisasubjectofcontroversy,we
have recently provided evidence that the electrochemical
observation corresponds to a “boundary region” of the zeo-
lite (52), situated close to the external surface, in agreement
with other authors (53). Therefore, the electrochemistry
measured not only corresponds to iron oxide particles at the
external surface of the crystal but also to framework iron
ions and other small intrazeolitic species strongly attached
to the zeolite (i.e., in the channels). However, since the elec-

occurs by tunneling, only a fraction of the zeolite crystal is
effectively probed. This is ellaborated elsewhere (52).
In this manuscript, graphite–polyester composite elec-
trodes (GPCEs) were used, which show voltammetric
responses similar to the polymer ﬁlm electrodes used in
previous studies (52). Figure 10 shows a series of cathodic
differential pulse voltammograms (DPVs) of GPCEs mod-

C4 and C5 are well deﬁned. For FeZSM-5c and ex-FeZSM-
5, a relatively complicated pattern can be observed, with
reduction peaks at +0.65 (C1), +0.35 (C2), +0.28 (C3),
+0.05 (C4), −0.15 (C5), −0.55 (C6), and −0.75 (C7) V vs

of FeZSM-5as and ex-FeZSM-5. During calcination and
steam treatment, peaks C1, C2, C3, C6, and C7 develop while
peaks C4 and C5 progressively decrease. Comparison of the
voltammetric response of ex-FeZSM-5 with that of Fe2O3
and FeO(OH) clearly indicates the different electrochemi-
cal behavior of iron species in the steamed zeolite and the
iron oxides.

cal response of FeZSM-5-modiﬁed electrodes is presented

scan voltammograms (LSVs) for GPCEs modiﬁed by ex-
FeZSM-5 (a and b) and FeZSM-5as (c and d) immersed
into 0.10 M HCl are shown. In anodic scans initiated at
−0.50 V vs SCE over ex-FeZSM-5, peaks at −0.18 (A6),
+0.36 (A3), +0.42 (A2) and +0.73 (A1) appear. Peaks A6
and A3 overlap the anodic counterparts of peaks C4 and
C5, i.e., A4 and A5, respectively.
The electrochemical processes involved with the corre-
sponding assignment are summarized in Table 4, based
on explanations elaborated elsewhere (33, 52). The C4/A4
and C5/A5 couples, which are mainly visible in the isomor-
phously substituted FeZSM-5as sample, can be assigned
to electron-transfer processes involving framework iron
atoms. In this case, the peak potentials are independent of
the potential scan rate and pH of the supporting electrolyte.
The existence of two couples has been attributed to two
different framework redox isomers having quite similar co-
ordination environments (52). A similar situation has been
recently reported by Venkatathri et al. (54) for vanadium-
containing zeolites. The electroactive iron species can be
described here in terms of O3Fe(OH) centers, similar to
O3Ti(OH) redox isomers identiﬁed in titanium silicalite
(55–58).
The electrode process C6, which is characteristic of ex-
FeZSM-5, exhibits electrochemical parameters close to
those described for the reductive dissolution of iron oxides
and hydrous oxides (59), which is also suggested by similar-
ity with the electrochemical response of the reference iron
oxides (especially that of hematite). The peak potential of
the process C6 shows a linear dependency with the pH of
the supporting electrolyte and the potential scan, exhibit-
ing the same behavior observed in hematite and goethite
(33). The anodic process A6 in ex-FeZSM-5 has been
assigned to the oxidative dissolution of iron(II) nanopar-
ticles (52). This process involves the presence of Fe(II) in
the steamed sample, which is in agreement with the Fe(II)
contribution identiﬁed in the M¨
ossbauer spectrum of the
fresh ex-FeZSM-5 sample at 300 K in air (see Fig. 8c and
Table 3). The peak C7 in ex-FeZSM-5 (Fig. 10c), which is
also present in hematite and goethite, is attributed to the
reduction of iron oxide and electrochemically generated
Fe2+ ions to metallic iron (metal deposition in Table 4).
The couple C3/A3 corresponds to an electron-transfer step
involving Fe3+ ions in solution, as suggested by the pres-
ence of this couple in LSVs recorded of unmodiﬁed elec-
trodes immersed into a diluted solution of FeCl3 · 6H2O in
0.10 M HCl (Fig. 11e). This peak is therefore attributed to
a redox process involving iron-chloride complexes in solu-
tion, resulting from leaching of iron species in the zeolite
boundary and reductive/oxidative dissolution processes.
This is likely related to the presence of the small oxide
particles.
The peak potential of the couple C1/A1 follows a linear
dependency with the pH and the potential scan rate (not
shown). In addition, the voltammetric curves exhibit a sym-
metric shape, which is characteristic of species strongly
attached to the electrode surface. We have tentatively
assigned the response to small oligonuclear oxo-iron
species in the zeolite channels that remain attached to the
zeolite boundary. These species undergo a rate-determining
protonation process coupled with the electron-transfer
step, as suggested by the slope of the Ep vs pH depen-
dency (65 mV). The peak potential of the couple C2/A2
also varies linearly with the potential scan rate but it is in-
dependent of pH. This couple is attributed to a redox pro-
cess involving isolated iron ions in cationic positions of the
zeolite.
It can be concluded that electrochemical characterization
during the different stages of the preparation of ex-FeZSM-
5 provides unique information with respect to different iron
species in the material, since different species can be iden-
tiﬁed simultaneously, based on their electrochemical activ-
ity. In the steamed catalyst, iron oxide nano-particles, iron
ions in cationic positions, and oligonuclear oxo-iron species

in the zeolite channels can be distinguished. Voltammetric
response techniques provide a ﬁngerprint of the heteroge-
neous nature of the iron species in the catalyst. Analysis of
our samples by average techniques, like EXAES, should be
taken into special consideration in order to interpret the

The following physicochemical changes have been ob-
served in the two activation steps (calcination and steam
treatment) of the isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5.
In the as-synthesized material complete substitution of
Fe(III) ions in the zeolite framework is concluded from
57Fe M¨
ossbauer and TEM analyses. Calcination of the as-
synthesized sample at 823 K leads to a complete removal
of the template, but hardly affects the Al coordination. On
the other hand, a considerable fraction of Fe (∼50%) is al-
ready extracted to extraframework positions. The created
extraframework species are highly dispersed in the zeolite
channels, mostly present as isolated or oligonuclear oxo-
iron species. The presence of both Fe(III) and Fe(II) oxida-
tion states (25% Fe(II)) after treatment in He at 623 K in
FeZSM-5c was observed, indicating signiﬁcant autoreduc-
tion of Fe(III) species. During steam treatment, hydrolysis
of the Al–OH and Fe–OH bonds takes place. As a conse-
quence, the density and strength of acid sites diminish. The
extraction of Al and Fe in the steaming procedure from
framework positions also leads to the formation of a broad
distribution of mesopores around 11 nm. Dealumination of
the zeolite framework leads to extraframework Al species
with different coordination and positions in ex-FeZSM-5,
although the nature of the Al species cannot be assessed in
detail. The dislodgment of iron can be described by a clus-
tering process, where the framework and extraframework
species formed on calcination partially approach each other
and accumulate as small iron oxide nanoparticles. A very
homogeneous and highly dispersed distribution of these
nanoparticles is obtained, with an average size of 1–2 nm.
The presence of extraframework Al species plays a role
in the formation of these nanoparticles and might be con-
tained on them. A considerable fraction of the small iron
oxidenanoparticlesmaybelocatedinsidethecreatedmeso-
pores, and not at the external surface of the zeolite. Other
forms of iron included in the steamed catalyst consist of
smaller iron species in the channels, as isolated compensat-
ing cations or oligonuclear oxo-iron species. The oxidation
state of iron in the freshly steamed catalyst was assessed to
be mainly Fe(III) with at least 10% Fe(II), suggesting that
the steam treatment provokes the reduction of a fraction of
Fe(III) species. Pretreatment of this sample in He at 623 K
leads to formation of 50% Fe(II), with the difference being
attributed to autoreduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) species. The
amount of the Fe(III) reduced in ex-FeZSM-5 depends on
the extent of the He pretreatment. H2-TPR after pretreat-
ment of the samples with N2O at 623 K conﬁrms that the
reduction in steamed FeZSM-5 is limited to the Fe(II) state.
No reduction to metallic iron takes place.
