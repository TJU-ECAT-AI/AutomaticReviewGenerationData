1. Introduction
It is known that the interaction of N O with
2
ZSM-5 type zeolites produces an extremely ac-
tive surface oxygen species discovered by Ref.

which was called a-oxygen
2 . The a-
oxygen is capable of converting ethane to ethy-
lene with 96–98% selectivity; it reacts with
methane
at
ambient
temperatures
to
give
methanol or converts benzene to phenol at mod-
erate temperatures. To understand the origin of
this extraordinary activity and selectivity, it is
necessary to study both the active sites for N O

hydrocarbon interaction with a-oxygen. There
is some information concerning the nature of
N O activation sites and chemical properties of
2
surface oxygen species at ambient temperatures,
but there is a lack of data concerning the chem-
istry of a-oxygen at temperatures of catalytic
processes. The objective of the present paper is
to study relative reactivities of different hydro-
carbons with respect to surface a-oxygen and
subsequent transformations of surface species
formed under condition of catalytic reaction.

ments were carried out without stabilization of

NMR, a relaxation delay of 120 s was set.
Another sample with TMS was used for calibra-
tion of field by replacement method. For 13C
NMR measurements, inverse-gated decoupling
was used to suppress nuclear Overhauser en-

3. Results and discussion
Under experimental conditions studied, the
selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane

from benzene is about 85–95% at conversion
up to 10% and remains constant with the time
though the activity decreases rapidly because of
deactivation of the catalyst. Under similar con-
ditions CO, CO

the main reaction route for Tol and Xy forma-
tion is the oxidative methylation of aromatic
ring with methane. Benzene appears to intercept
the surface species formed from methane and
a-oxygen, which are converted to CO
in the
2
case of CH –N O feed. It is reasonable to

Substantial number of non-labeled molecules of
Ind and Naph and those containing only one 13C
atom show the notable contribution of benzene
to their formation accompanied with intense
scrambling of 13C label. Therefore, condensed
hydrocarbons are formed most probably by
means of surface hydrocarbon’s residue trans-
formation, but detailed mechanism of the reac-
tion needs further studies.
4. Conclusion
The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the oxida-
tive conversions on HZSM-5 in the presence of
N O has been found to correlate with the
2
`
strength of C H bond. Under reaction condi-
tion, methane is able to alkylate the aromatic
ring of benzene giving toluene and xylenes.
