[1] "Various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction."
[2] "Initial propene yields in the range of 19-22% at 673 K were achieved over these catalysts, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%)."
[3] "The influence of the reaction temperature on the performance and dynamics of deactivation of FeZSM-5 has been further investigated in this study."
[4] "The catalyst typically activates during the first minutes of reaction."
[5] "This distinctive behavior can be tentatively related to the slower decrease of propene yield at 773 K, which correlates with a more gradual increase of the coke content."
[6] "The relatively slow deactivation of FeZSM-5 at 773 K can be associated with the high N2O conversion measured after 400 min on stream (72%)."
[7] "The fact that the initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 were very similar over the fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 indicates that the number of active sites in the beginning of the reaction and in steady-state conditions is not reduced in the regenerated samples."
[8] "With these settings, reaction and regeneration can be effectively coupled to ensure continuous propene production at the desired yield."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact their performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Various synthesis techniques can result in different levels of initial propene yields, propane conversion, and propene selectivity. The reaction temperature significantly affects the catalyst's performance and deactivation dynamics. The catalyst tends to activate during the initial moments of the reaction, and the rate of deactivation is slower at higher temperatures, possibly due to a more gradual increase in coke content. The high N2O conversion at 773 K contributes to the catalyst's stability. Notably, the initial and residual propene yields remain similar before and after regeneration, suggesting that the number of active sites is not reduced. By optimizing the reaction and regeneration parameters, the process can achieve continuous propene production at the desired yield.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，影响它们在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。不同的合成技术可以导致不同的初始丙烯产率、丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。反应温度显著影响催化剂的性能和失活动态。催化剂通常在反应初期激活，且在较高温度下，脱活速率较慢，可能与焦炭含量的逐渐增加有关。773K时较高的N2O转化率有助于催化剂的稳定性。值得注意的是，在再生前后，初始和残留丙烯产率保持相似，表明活性位点的数量没有减少。通过优化反应和再生参数，该过程可以在期望的产率下实现连续丙烯生产。
