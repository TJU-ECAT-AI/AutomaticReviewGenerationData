[1] "Previous studies have shown that the initial performance of various steam-activated iron zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) is rather similar, regardless of the different form(s) of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity."
[2] "Among the catalysts tested, FeZSM-5 exhibited a slightly higher initial activity and, most importantly, a higher resistance toward deactivation."
[3] "Initial propene yields in the range of 19-22% at 723 K were achieved over these catalysts, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%)."
[4] "The catalyst typically activates during the first minutes of reaction. This process is particularly noticeable at 723 K, leading to an increase in propene yield from 22% to 25% after ca. 20 min on stream."
[5] "At 773 and 723 K, a propene yield >20% was preserved during 200 and 100 min, respectively, in contrast to the rapid deactivation at 673 K."
[6] "The initial N2O conversion increases from 76% at 673 K to 100% at 723 and 773 K, while the increase in C3H8 conversion is less pronounced (from 40% to 50%) and does not increase further at 773 K."
[7] "The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition, leading to an increased amount of COx."
[8] "Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) as well as isothermal oxidation experiments in air were carried out to determine the optimal regeneration conditions (temperature and duration) of the coke-deactivated FeZSM-5."
[9] "With these settings, reaction and regeneration can be effectively coupled to ensure continuous propene production at the desired yield."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, exhibit similar catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, show a similar degree among the catalysts tested. Among these, FeZSM-5 displays slightly higher initial activity and better resistance against deactivation.

2. The initial propene yields range from 19% to 22% at 723 K for the tested catalysts. The degree of propane conversion and propene selectivity is approximately 45% and 50%, respectively. 

3. FeZSM-5 exhibits a noticeable activation process during the first few minutes of reaction at 723 K, leading to a propene yield increase from 22% to 25%.

4. At 773 and 723 K, the catalyst maintains a propene yield greater than 20% for 200 and 100 minutes, respectively, contrasting with rapid deactivation at 673 K.

5. The N2O conversion increases from 76% at 673 K to 100% at 723 and 773 K. The increase in C3H8 conversion is less pronounced, ranging from 40% to 50%, and does not increase further at 773 K.

6. Upon adding O2 to the C3H8+N2O mixture, the C3H6 selectivity decreases from 46% to 22%, leading to an increased amount of COx.

7. Regeneration conditions, including temperature and duration, were determined through temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) and isothermal oxidation experiments in air for coke-deactivated FeZSM-5.

8. The optimized cyclic process allows for continuous propene production at the desired yield by effectively coupling reaction and regeneration steps.

1. 不同合成方法的铁基ZSM-5沸石催化剂，在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能相似。性能指标，包括丙烯烷基化转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率，在测试的催化剂中显示出类似程度。其中，FeZSM-5表现出稍高的初始活性和更好的抗失活能力。

2. 在723 K时，测试催化剂的初始丙烯产率范围为19%-22%。丙烷转化率和丙烯选择率大约为45%和50%。

3. FeZSM-5在723 K时表现出明显的激活过程，在反应开始几分钟后，丙烯产率从22%增加到25%。

4. 在773和723 K时，催化剂保持大于20%的丙烯产率，分别持续200分钟和100分钟，与673 K时的快速失活形成对比。

5. N2O转化率从673 K时的76%，增加到723和773 K时的100%。C3H8转化率的增加不那么显著，从40%增加到50%，且在773 K时不进一步增加。

6. 向C3H8+N2O混合物中添加O2后，C3H6选择性从46%降低到22%，导致COx含量增加。
