[1] "Previous studies have shown that the initial performance of various steam-activated iron zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) is rather similar, regardless of the different form(s) of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity."
[2] "Among the catalysts tested, FeZSM-5 exhibited a slightly higher initial activity and, most importantly, a higher resistance toward deactivation."
[3] "Initial propene yields in the range of 19-22% at 723 K were achieved over these catalysts, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%)."
[4] "The duration of each analysis in these studies was of at least 15 min and up to 100 min."
[5] "The characteristic inflection point in the coking profiles at the time of the drop of the propene yield at 673 and 723 K, which was also noticed in other iron zeolites,7 was not observed at 773 K."
[6] "An additional feature of the TEOM microbalance to follow catalyst deactivation consists of simply monitoring the temperature of the outlet gas by a thermocouple situated at a distance of 3 mm after the catalyst bed."
[7] "At 723 K, a propene yield >20% was preserved during 200 and 100 min, respectively, in contrast to the rapid deactivation at 673 K."
[8] "In all cases, the decrease of propene yield is coupled with the decrease of C3H8 and N2O conversions."
[9] "The influence of the reaction temperature on the performance and dynamics of deactivation of FeZSM-5 has been further investigated in this study."
[10] "The results in Figure 7 differ from those reported by Bulnek et al.9 These authors concluded that although the propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 (301200 ppm Fe) was decreased in N2O+O2 as compared to N2O, the propene yield was not significantly changed, due to the increased propene conversion in the presence of O2."

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, do not significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. These metrics show a similar degree of performance across the various catalysts tested, with slight variations in initial activity and resistance towards deactivation.

2. The performance of various steam-activated iron zeolites in the ODHP reaction is quite similar, with initial propene yields in the range of 19-22% at 723 K. The catalysts exhibit a comparable degree of propane conversion (around 45%) and propene selectivity (around 50%).

3. The duration of analysis for the studies mentioned in the text ranged from 15 to 100 minutes.

4. The absence of the characteristic inflection point in the coking profiles at 773 K suggests a different behavior in the deactivation process compared to lower temperatures.

5. Monitoring the temperature of the outlet gas provides a method to track catalyst deactivation, indicating the effectiveness of the TEOM microbalance in assessing the performance of the catalyst.

6. At 723 K, the catalyst demonstrates a higher resistance towards deactivation, maintaining a propene yield greater than 20% for longer durations compared to 673 K.

7. The decrease in propene yield is consistently linked to a decrease in C3H8 and N2O conversions across different temperatures, reflecting the dynamic relationship between these parameters.

8. The study investigates the effects of temperature on the performance and deactivation dynamics of FeZSM-5 in the ODHP reaction, highlighting the importance of temperature in controlling the efficiency of the catalyst.

9. The results presented in the text contrast with those of Bulnek et al., who found that the use of O2 in the presence of N2O led to a significant decrease in propene selectivity over H-ZSM-5 but had a minimal effect on propene yield, likely due to increased propene conversion.

1.X公司通过蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换等方法合成的铁基ZSM-5沸石在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能相当，这些方法对催化剂性能的影响不大。关键的性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率，这些指标在不同催化剂测试中显示出了相似的性能，略有差异在于初始活性和抗失活能力。

2. 在723K下，各种蒸汽活化的铁基沸石在氧化脱氢反应中的初始丙烯产率在19%-22%之间。催化剂的丙烷转化率约为45%，丙烯选择率约为50%，显示出相当程度的一致性。

3. 文中提到的研究分析持续时间从15分钟到100分钟不等。

4. 在773K下未观察到丙烯产率下降的特征转折点，表明该温度下的失活过程与较低温度有所不同。

5. 监测出口气体温度的方法能够追踪催化剂的失活情况，显示TEOM微平衡在评估催化剂性能时的有效性。

6. 在723K下，催化剂表现出更高的抗失活能力，保持丙烯产率超过20%的时间比673K更长。

7. 丙烯产率的减少始终与丙烷转化率和N2O转化率的降低相一致，反映了这些参数之间的动态关系。

8. 研究探讨了温度对FeZSM-5在氧化脱氢反应中的性能和失活动力学的影响，强调了温度在控制催化剂效率方面的重要性。

9. 文中给出的结果与Bulnek等人的研究结果形成对比，后者发现氧气的存在导致H-ZSM-5的丙烯选择性显著降低，但对丙烯产率的影响较小，这可能是由于丙烯转化率的增加所致。
