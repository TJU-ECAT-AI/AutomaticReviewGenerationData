[1] "Previous studies have shown that the initial performance of various steam-activated iron zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) is rather similar, regardless of the different form(s) of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity."
[2] "Initial propene yields in the range of 19-22% at 723 K were achieved over these catalysts, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%)."
[3] "The influence of the reaction temperature on the performance and dynamics of deactivation of FeZSM-5 has been further investigated in this study. Figure 4 shows the coke content, propene yield, and conversions of propane and nitrous oxide versus time on stream during ODHP with N2O at different temperatures, as derived from the TEOM and coupled gas chromatographic analysis."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, exhibit similar catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include the conversion of propane (C3H8), conversion of nitrous oxide (N2O), selectivity for propene (S(C3H6)), and yield of propene (Y(C3H6)). 

2. The initial performance of these iron zeolites is characterized by propene yields ranging from 19% to 22% at 723 K, along with comparable propane conversions around 45% and propene selectivities around 50%.

3. The reaction temperature significantly influences the performance and deactivation dynamics of FeZSM-5 in the ODHP process. The coke content, propene yield, and conversions of propane and N2O are temperature-dependent variables that reflect the efficiency of the catalyst under varying thermal conditions.

1.X公司采用的不同铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，在使用N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中表现出相似的催化性能。这些关键性能指标，包括丙烷（C3H8）转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯（C3H6）选择性以及丙烯产量（Y(C3H6)），在不同的反应条件下展示了催化剂的有效性。

2. 这些铁基沸石的初始表现表现为在723K时，丙烯产率为19%-22%，丙烷转化率约为45%，丙烯选择性约为50%。

3. 反应温度对FeZSM-5在ODHP过程中的性能和失活动态有显著影响。焦炭含量、丙烯产率以及丙烷和N2O的转化率是反映催化剂在不同热条件下的效率的温度依赖性变量。
