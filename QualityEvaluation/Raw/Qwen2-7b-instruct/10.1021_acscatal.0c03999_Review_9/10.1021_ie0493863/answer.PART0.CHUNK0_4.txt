[1] "Previous studies have shown that the initial performance of various steam-activated iron zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta) is rather similar, regardless of the different form(s) of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity."
[2] "Initial propene yields in the range of 19-22% at 723 K were achieved over these catalysts, with a similar degree of propane conversion (ca. 45%) and propene selectivity (ca. 50%)."
[3] "Among the catalysts tested, FeZSM-5 exhibited a slightly higher initial activity and, most importantly, a higher resistance toward deactivation."
[4] "The influence of the reaction temperature on the performance and dynamics of deactivation of FeZSM-5 has been further investigated in this study."
[5] "The catalyst typically activates during the first minutes of reaction. This process is particularly noticeable at 723 K, leading to an increase in propene yield from 22% to 25% after ca. 20 min on stream."
[6] "At 773 and 723 K, a propene yield >20% was preserved during 200 and 100 min, respectively, in contrast to the rapid deactivation at 673 K."
[7] "The degree of C3H8 conversion (after 2 min on stream) was very similar in both cases (ca. 50%), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 46% to 22% upon O2 addition."
[8] "The fact that the initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 were very similar over the fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 indicates that the number of active sites in the beginning of the reaction and in steady-state conditions is not reduced in the regenerated samples."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, exhibit similar catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, show a consistent effectiveness under different reaction conditions. FeZSM-5 catalysts display a slight advantage in initial activity and resistance towards deactivation compared to other iron zeolites.

2. The initial performance of steam-activated iron zeolites, such as FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, is similar, regardless of the form of extraframework iron species, zeolite host, and catalyst acidity. They achieve propene yields ranging from 19 to 22% at 723 K, with a comparable degree of propane conversion around 45% and propene selectivity around 50%.

3. FeZSM-5 catalysts show a higher initial activity and better resistance against deactivation compared to other iron zeolites. The performance of FeZSM-5 is influenced by the reaction temperature, and its initial performance is recovered upon air-regeneration.

4. The reaction temperature has a significant impact on the performance and deactivation dynamics of FeZSM-5 catalysts. At 723 K, the catalyst activates during the first minutes of reaction, increasing the propene yield from 22% to 25% within approximately 20 minutes. At 773 K, the catalyst maintains a propene yield greater than 20% for 200 minutes, in contrast to rapid deactivation observed at 673 K.

5. The addition of oxygen to the C3H8+N2O mixture negatively affects the selectivity of the ODHP reaction, reducing the C3H6 selectivity from 46% to 22%. Despite this, the degree of C3H8 conversion remains unchanged.

6. The initial and residual propene yields over FeZSM-5 catalysts before and after regeneration are very similar, indicating that the number of active sites is not reduced during the regeneration process.

1. 不同合成方法的铁含有的ZSM-5沸石催化剂，在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能相似，无论额外框架铁物种的形式、沸石载体和催化剂酸性。关键性能指标，包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同反应条件下显示出一致的有效性。FeZSM-5催化剂在初始活性和对抗失活方面具有优势。

2. 蒸汽活化的铁基沸石（如FeZSM-5、Fe-silicalite和Fe-beta）的初始性能相似，与额外框架铁物种的形式、沸石载体和催化剂酸性无关。它们在723 K时的丙烯产率为19-22%，丙烷转化率为约45%，丙烯选择性为约50%。

3. FeZSM-5催化剂在初始活性和抗失活能力上优于其他铁沸石催化剂。FeZSM-5的性能受到反应温度的影响，并且其初始性能可以通过空气再生恢复。

4. 在723 K时，催化剂在反应开始几分钟内激活，导致丙烯产率从22%增加到25%左右，大约在20分钟后。在773 K时，催化剂可以维持20%以上的丙烯产率长达200分钟，这与在673 K时的快速失活形成鲜明对比。

5. 将氧气添加到C3H8+N2O混合物中对ODHP反应有负面影响，使C3H6选择性从46%降低到22%。尽管如此，C3H8转化率保持不变。

6. FeZSM-5催化剂在再生前后，初始和剩余的丙烯产率非常相似，表明再生过程中活性位点的数量没有减少。
