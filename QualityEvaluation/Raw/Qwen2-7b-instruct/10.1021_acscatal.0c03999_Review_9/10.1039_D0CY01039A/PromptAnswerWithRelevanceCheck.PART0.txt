The use of alternative oxidants, particularly gaseous elemental sulfur, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to reduce the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with oxygen. The effectiveness of this approach varies significantly depending on the identity of the metal sulfide catalyst, with product selectivities ranging from 86% propylene over ZrO2 to 38% over PdS at 550°C. The experimental activation energy (Eapp) values for propylene formation increase with the XPS sulfur binding energy, which qualitatively estimates the metal-sulfur bond strength and electron density. This study demonstrates that sulfur oxide dehydrogenation (SODHP) can be an effective and selective route for propylene formation using inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts.

对于氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）而言，使用替代氧化剂，特别是元素硫蒸气，是一种有前景的方法，可以抑制与氧气发生时容易出现的COx过度氧化。这种方法的有效性在很大程度上取决于金属硫化物催化剂的类型，产品选择性从ZrO2上的86%丙烯到PdS上的38%在550°C时变化。实验得到的丙烯形成活化能（Eapp）值随着XPS硫结合能的增加而增加，这定性地估计了金属-硫键强度和电子密度。本研究证明，硫氧化物脱氢化（SODHP）可以通过使用价格低廉且耐硫的催化剂有效地选择性合成丙烯。

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 

The performance metrics show significant variation depending on the synthesis method used. For instance, one method might lead to higher C3H8 conversion, while another might optimize N2O conversion or enhance C3H6 selectivity and yield. The specific details of how each synthesis method impacts these metrics would require a detailed analysis of the literature, including the results of the experiments conducted on each catalyst.

The effectiveness of the catalysts is demonstrated by the ability to achieve high conversion rates of propane (up to 8.1%) and high selectivities for propylene (up to 86%). The contact time of the gas feed can influence the relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity, with higher conversions generally leading to reduced propylene selectivity and increased CS2 selectivity. This trade-off suggests that the catalysts are capable of selectively producing propylene under certain conditions.

The sulfur order in the rate law for S-Co3O4 is approximately half-order, indicating a slower dissociation step for sulfur during the SODHP reaction over this catalyst. This kinetic difference compared to S-ZrO2, which exhibits a zero-order dependence on sulfur, suggests that the role of sulfur in the reaction mechanism differs between the two catalysts. 

The proposed mechanism for SODHP over the present metal sulfide catalysts involves propane C-H activation by a surface sulfur species, leading to surface reduction. The rate-determining step is influenced by the metal-sulfur bonding strength and electron density of the sulfur atoms on the surface. As the M-S bond becomes weaker, the surface reduction of propane becomes more facile, potentially affecting the re-sulfidation step and influencing the overall catalytic performance.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对其在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生不同的影响。在不同反应条件下，用于评估催化剂性能的关键指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

根据文献中进行的实验，不同合成方法对这些指标的影响程度存在显著差异。例如，一种方法可能能够提高丙烷转化率，而另一种方法可能优化N2O转化或增强C3H6选择性和产率。具体地，每种合成方法如何影响这些指标需要详细分析文献中的实验结果。

通过实现高达8.1%的丙烷转化率和高达86%的丙烯选择性，催化剂的有效性得到了证明。接触时间的气体流速可以影响丙烷转化率与产物选择性的关系，较高的转化率通常导致丙烯选择性的降低和CS2选择性的增加。这种权衡表明，在特定条件下，催化剂能够选择性地生产丙烯。

硫在S-Co3O4中的速率定律中大约为半级依赖性，表明硫在SODHP反应中对于此催化剂的较慢解离步骤。这表明与S-ZrO2相比，S-Co3O4在硫的反应速率上具有不同的动力学特性，后者表现出硫浓度与丙烷零级依赖的关系。

提出的SODHP机制涉及在表面硫物种作用下丙烷C-H活化，导致表面还原。作为关键步骤，金属-硫键强度和硫原子上的电子密度影响着表面活性。随着M-S键变弱，丙烷在表面上的还原变得更加容易，可能会影响表面再硫化步骤，从而影响整体催化性能。

1. Gaseous elemental sulfur acts as an effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The product selectivity varies significantly depending on the metal sulfide catalyst used. For instance, 86% of the product is propylene when using S-ZrO2 at 550°C, compared to 38% when using PdS under similar conditions. 

2. The activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation increases with the sulfur binding energy as measured by XPS. This provides a qualitative measure of the metal-sulfur bond strength and electron density.

3. Respectable yields of propylene were achieved with multiple catalysts tested. This study shows that sulfur dioxide (SODHP) is a feasible method for the selective formation of propylene using inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts.

2. 丙烯形成过程的活化能（Eapp）随着XPS测量的硫原子结合能的增加而增加。这提供了金属-硫键强度和电子密度的定性度量。

3. 多种催化剂测试时都获得了可接受的丙烯产量。这项研究显示，通过使用价格低廉且耐硫的催化剂，SODHP是一种可行的丙烯选择性生成方法。

The investigation focused on six catalysts for SODHP across a temperature range of 450-550°C. Propylene selectivity varied significantly among the catalysts, from 86% with S-ZrO2 to 38% with PdS. The study also explored how propane conversion and product selectivity changed with altered contact time of the gas feed. Another critical question was identifying the intrinsic sulfide properties that dictate catalyst activity in SODHP, linking these properties to the apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation. The sulfur binding energy was found to correlate with Eapp, with lower binding energy correlating to weaker metal-sulfur bonding and thus lower Eapp. Contrary to S-ZrO2, the reaction rate over S-Co3O4 showed an increase with higher sulfur concentration.

研究集中在450-550°C范围内对六种催化剂的SODHP性能。丙烯选择性在不同催化剂之间变化显著，从S-ZrO2的86%到PdS的38%不等。研究还探讨了通过改变气体接触时间来调整丙烷转化率和产物选择性的关系。另一个关键问题是确定影响SODHP活性的内在硫化物性质，并将这些性质与形成丙烯的显热激活能（Eapp）联系起来。发现硫化物结合能与Eapp呈负相关，较低的结合能意味着较弱的金属-硫键，因此Eapp也较低。与S-ZrO2相反，S-Co3O4的反应速率随着硫浓度的增加而增加。
