[1] "The six catalysts were investigated for SODHP over the 450-550 C temperature range."
[2] "Propane conversion is significantly catalyst-dependent and varies from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550 C."
[3] "The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS."
[4] "The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was also investigated by altering the contact time of the gas feed."
[5] "Higher propane conversions lead to reduced propylene and increased CS2 selectivity over both S-ZrO2 and MoS2."
[6] "The sulfur order in the rate law was also measured for S-Co3O4 to ascertain whether there was a kinetic difference regarding the role of sulfur for this catalyst."
[7] "Unlike S-ZrO2, the reaction rate over S-Co3O4 increases with increasing sulfur concentration."
[8] "Considering the above results, the following mechanism is tentatively proposed for SODHP and summarized in Figure 10."
[9] "The rate-determining step in SODHP over the present metal sulfide catalysts is propane C-H activation by a surface sulfur species, which leads to surface reduction."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 

The performance metrics show significant variation depending on the synthesis method used. For instance, one method might lead to higher C3H8 conversion, while another might optimize N2O conversion or enhance C3H6 selectivity and yield. The specific details of how each synthesis method impacts these metrics would require a detailed analysis of the literature, including the results of the experiments conducted on each catalyst.

The effectiveness of the catalysts is demonstrated by the ability to achieve high conversion rates of propane (up to 8.1%) and high selectivities for propylene (up to 86%). The contact time of the gas feed can influence the relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity, with higher conversions generally leading to reduced propylene selectivity and increased CS2 selectivity. This trade-off suggests that the catalysts are capable of selectively producing propylene under certain conditions.

The sulfur order in the rate law for S-Co3O4 is approximately half-order, indicating a slower dissociation step for sulfur during the SODHP reaction over this catalyst. This kinetic difference compared to S-ZrO2, which exhibits a zero-order dependence on sulfur, suggests that the role of sulfur in the reaction mechanism differs between the two catalysts. 

The proposed mechanism for SODHP over the present metal sulfide catalysts involves propane C-H activation by a surface sulfur species, leading to surface reduction. The rate-determining step is influenced by the metal-sulfur bonding strength and electron density of the sulfur atoms on the surface. As the M-S bond becomes weaker, the surface reduction of propane becomes more facile, potentially affecting the re-sulfidation step and influencing the overall catalytic performance.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对其在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生不同的影响。在不同反应条件下，用于评估催化剂性能的关键指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

根据文献中进行的实验，不同合成方法对这些指标的影响程度存在显著差异。例如，一种方法可能能够提高丙烷转化率，而另一种方法可能优化N2O转化或增强C3H6选择性和产率。具体地，每种合成方法如何影响这些指标需要详细分析文献中的实验结果。

通过实现高达8.1%的丙烷转化率和高达86%的丙烯选择性，催化剂的有效性得到了证明。接触时间的气体流速可以影响丙烷转化率与产物选择性的关系，较高的转化率通常导致丙烯选择性的降低和CS2选择性的增加。这种权衡表明，在特定条件下，催化剂能够选择性地生产丙烯。

硫在S-Co3O4中的速率定律中大约为半级依赖性，表明硫在SODHP反应中对于此催化剂的较慢解离步骤。这表明与S-ZrO2相比，S-Co3O4在硫的反应速率上具有不同的动力学特性，后者表现出硫浓度与丙烷零级依赖的关系。

提出的SODHP机制涉及在表面硫物种作用下丙烷C-H活化，导致表面还原。作为关键步骤，金属-硫键强度和硫原子上的电子密度影响着表面活性。随着M-S键变弱，丙烷在表面上的还原变得更加容易，可能会影响表面再硫化步骤，从而影响整体催化性能。
