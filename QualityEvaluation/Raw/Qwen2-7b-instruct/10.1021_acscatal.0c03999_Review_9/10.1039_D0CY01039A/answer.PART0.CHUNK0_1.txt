[1] "The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2."
[2] "Gaseous elemental sulfur is found to be an effective oxidant for ODHP, and the product selectivities vary significantly depending on the metal sulfide catalyst identity (86% propylene over S-ZrO2 versus 38% over PdS at 550 C, for example)."
[3] "The experimental Eapp values for propylene formation are shown to scale/increase with increasing XPS sulfur binding energy, a qualitative experimental estimate of M-S bond strength and electron density."
[4] "Additionally, respectable propylene yields are obtained for a number of the catalysts examined. The findings reported in this study demonstrate that SODHP is a viable route to selective propylene formation over inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts."

The use of alternative oxidants, particularly gaseous elemental sulfur, in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to reduce the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with oxygen. The effectiveness of this approach varies significantly depending on the identity of the metal sulfide catalyst, with product selectivities ranging from 86% propylene over ZrO2 to 38% over PdS at 550°C. The experimental activation energy (Eapp) values for propylene formation increase with the XPS sulfur binding energy, which qualitatively estimates the metal-sulfur bond strength and electron density. This study demonstrates that sulfur oxide dehydrogenation (SODHP) can be an effective and selective route for propylene formation using inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts.

对于氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）而言，使用替代氧化剂，特别是元素硫蒸气，是一种有前景的方法，可以抑制与氧气发生时容易出现的COx过度氧化。这种方法的有效性在很大程度上取决于金属硫化物催化剂的类型，产品选择性从ZrO2上的86%丙烯到PdS上的38%在550°C时变化。实验得到的丙烯形成活化能（Eapp）值随着XPS硫结合能的增加而增加，这定性地估计了金属-硫键强度和电子密度。本研究证明，硫氧化物脱氢化（SODHP）可以通过使用价格低廉且耐硫的催化剂有效地选择性合成丙烯。
