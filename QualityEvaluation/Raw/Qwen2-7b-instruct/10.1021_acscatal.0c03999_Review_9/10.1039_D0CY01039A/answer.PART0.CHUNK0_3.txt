[1] "Gaseous elemental sulfur is found to be an effective oxidant for ODHP, and the product selectivities vary significantly depending on the metal sulfide catalyst identity (86% propylene over S-ZrO2 versus 38% over PdS at 550 C,for example)."
[2] "The experimental Eapp values for propylene formation are shown to scale/increase with increasing XPS sulfur binding energy, a qualitative experimental estimate of M-S bond strength and electron density."
[3] "Additionally, respectable propylene yields are obtained for a number of the catalysts examined. The findings reported in this study demonstrate that SODHP is a viable route to selective propylene formation over inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts."

1. Gaseous elemental sulfur acts as an effective oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The product selectivity varies significantly depending on the metal sulfide catalyst used. For instance, 86% of the product is propylene when using S-ZrO2 at 550°C, compared to 38% when using PdS under similar conditions. 

2. The activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation increases with the sulfur binding energy as measured by XPS. This provides a qualitative measure of the metal-sulfur bond strength and electron density.

3. Respectable yields of propylene were achieved with multiple catalysts tested. This study shows that sulfur dioxide (SODHP) is a feasible method for the selective formation of propylene using inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts.

1. 气态硫磺是ODHP反应的有效氧化剂。产物选择性根据使用的金属硫化物催化剂而变化。例如，使用S-ZrO2在550°C时，产品中丙烯的比例为86%，而使用PdS时，在相似条件下，这一比例降为38%。

2. 丙烯形成过程的活化能（Eapp）随着XPS测量的硫原子结合能的增加而增加。这提供了金属-硫键强度和电子密度的定性度量。

3. 多种催化剂测试时都获得了可接受的丙烯产量。这项研究显示，通过使用价格低廉且耐硫的催化剂，SODHP是一种可行的丙烯选择性生成方法。
