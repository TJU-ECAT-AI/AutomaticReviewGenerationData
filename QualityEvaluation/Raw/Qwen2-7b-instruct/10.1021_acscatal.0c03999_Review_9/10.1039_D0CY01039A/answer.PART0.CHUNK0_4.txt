[1] "Six catalysts were investigated for SODHP over the 450-550 C temperature range."

[3] "The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was also investigated by altering the contact time of the gas feed."
[4] "Since the SODHP catalytic properties are strongly dependent on the metal sulfide identity, another question concerning this reaction is what intrinsic sulfide properties govern catalyst activity."
[5] "Eapp decreases as the binding energy decreases (weaker M-S bonding)."
[6] "Unlike S-ZrO2, the reaction rate over S-Co3O4 increases with increasing sulfur concentration."

The investigation focused on six catalysts for SODHP across a temperature range of 450-550°C. Propylene selectivity varied significantly among the catalysts, from 86% with S-ZrO2 to 38% with PdS. The study also explored how propane conversion and product selectivity changed with altered contact time of the gas feed. Another critical question was identifying the intrinsic sulfide properties that dictate catalyst activity in SODHP, linking these properties to the apparent activation energy (Eapp) for propylene formation. The sulfur binding energy was found to correlate with Eapp, with lower binding energy correlating to weaker metal-sulfur bonding and thus lower Eapp. Contrary to S-ZrO2, the reaction rate over S-Co3O4 showed an increase with higher sulfur concentration.

研究集中在450-550°C范围内对六种催化剂的SODHP性能。丙烯选择性在不同催化剂之间变化显著，从S-ZrO2的86%到PdS的38%不等。研究还探讨了通过改变气体接触时间来调整丙烷转化率和产物选择性的关系。另一个关键问题是确定影响SODHP活性的内在硫化物性质，并将这些性质与形成丙烯的显热激活能（Eapp）联系起来。发现硫化物结合能与Eapp呈负相关，较低的结合能意味着较弱的金属-硫键，因此Eapp也较低。与S-ZrO2相反，S-Co3O4的反应速率随着硫浓度的增加而增加。
