To this end, direct N2O decomposition and N2O reduction with CO in the absence or presence of NO were investi- gated using a combination of transient pulse and steady-state techniques over steam-activated FeMFI zeolites with a similar iron content (0.60.7 wt% Fe) and different framework compositions (SiAl, SiGa, SiGe, and Si). The forms of iron in the catalysts were characterized by UV/vis and HRTEM. The intrinsic reaction mechanism determines the optimal iron site distribution, which can be modulated by tuning the steaming temperature during activation. Oligonuclear iron oxo clusters in the zeolite channels are essential in direct N2O decomposition due to a faster desorption of O2 as compared to isolated ions. Such forms of active iron can be achieved at a lower steam-activation temper- ature over FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI (900 K) than over FeGeMFI and FeMFI (1150 K). Contrarily, zeolites with a more uniform distribution of isolated iron species lead to higher activities in N2O reduction with CO as compared to highly clustered catalysts. In this case, O-removal as CO2 is strongly accelerated vis--vis O2 desorption in direct N2O decomposition. The dual role of NO as a promotor in N2O decom- position and as an inhibitor in N2O reduction also supports the participation of different sites in both types of conversions. NO selectively inhibits N2O reduction over isolated iron ions, further evidencing the essential role of oligonuclear iron clusters in the NO-assisted N2O decomposition. 2004 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
The origin of the catalytic activity in reactions catalyzed by iron zeolites, and particularly the FeMFI system, has been intensively debated over the last decade. In general, the in- activity of iron ions in tetrahedral framework positions as well as of large iron oxide particles at the external surface of the zeolite crystal has been agreed upon [15]. The activ- ity has been typically attributed to extraframework species confined in the zeolite pores. Two generic iron forms, iso- lated iron ions and oligonuclear iron clusters, have been equivocally designated as the active sites in various reac- tions. Different authors have considered oligonuclear iron * Fax: +47 24 15 8213.

Prez-Ramrez). complexes as the active sites in direct N2O decomposition [68], N2O-mediated oxidation of benzene to phenol [911],and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with hydro- carbons [1216]. Conflictingly, other authors claim (or at least do not exclude explicitly) a preponderant role of iso- lated ions in these oxidation [1720] and reduction [7,21,22] processes.
The unification of the various interpretations with re- spect to the active sites is extremely complicated due to the intrinsic heterogeneous constitution of iron species in the zeolite [5,7,23]. Despite considerable efforts to charac- terize these materials, available data are not sufficient to conclude exclusively on the structure of the active iron, par- ticularly the nuclearity of the iron oxo clusters as well as the exact location of extraframework iron species [24]. The ar- chitecture of active clusters has been mainly hypothesized 0021-9517/$  see front matter 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jcat.2004.08.005

513 as oxygen-bridged binuclear Feoxo cations [10,14,15,25],although species with an average composition of Fe4O4 have been also reported [13]. Regardless, input from average techniques like EXAFS to determine the iron coordination should be carefully analyzed and contrasted with other char- acterization methods, in view of the variety of iron species in the catalyst. Application of different preparation approaches,which strongly affects the variety and relative amount of iron species, makes it more intricate. Particularly challeng- ing in practice is suppressing clustering and precipitation of iron species, especially by application of postsynthesis methods and high iron loadings. The extraction of frame- work iron in isomorphously substituted Fe zeolites upon treatment in air, vacuum, or steam is claimed as a more re- producible method to disperse iron species into microporous matrices, although not allowing the insertion of a high iron content [24].
An essential aspect to be analyzed on activity determi- nation, which has not been emphasized in the literature,concerns the application of iron zeolites in a wide range of catalytic reactions with a different mechanism. As put for- ward in a recent research note [7], the intrinsic mechanism of reactions involving N2O (decomposition or reduction) determines the optimal iron site architecture. The frequent practice of designating a universal active site for all type of iron zeolite-catalyzed conversions is improbable by merely attending to a diversity principle. Rather, a distribution of active iron species is more plausible, which are more or less utilized depending on the mechanism and microkinet- ics of the particular process. In this matter, the preparation of Fe zeolites with a tailored or uniform distribution of iron species and a more detailed knowledge of the implicated reaction mechanisms would definitively lead to a better un- derstanding of the site(s) inducing activity. The fundamental and practical relevance of the previous results in [7] de- serves further investigation in order to establish a more solid generalization, since that study was confined to two zeolite samples (FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite), which were steam- activated at two temperatures and evaluated under steady- state conditions. Besides, no experimental evidence leading to correlations between specific mechanistic features and the preferred iron constitution was provided.
On this basis, the present work was undertaken to exam- ine the influence of the intrinsic reaction mechanism of vari- ous N2O conversions on the nature of the optimal iron site(s) over iron zeolites. To this end, the mechanism and kinetics of direct N2O decomposition and N2O reduction with CO (in the absence of presence of NO) have been elucidated by a combination of transient and steady-state techniques. This information was correlated with the iron forms in FeMFI ze- olites with four different framework compositions (SiAl, SiGa, SiGe, and Si) upon steam activation in a broad tem- perature range (6731273 K). The results derived lead to an improved rational basis for catalyst design in reactions in- volving N2O.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Details on the hydrothermal synthesis of the MFI zeo- lites with FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and FeSi frameworks, as well as the calcinations and ion-exchange treatments pre- vious to steam activation, have been described in previous publications [5,26]. The FeGeSi MFI zeolite was pre- pared following the same procedure, adding Ge(NO3)3 as the germanium source in the synthesis gel. The nominal mo- lar metal ratios in the hydrothermal syntheses were Si/(Al or Ga) = 35, Si/Ge = 250, and Si/Fe = 150. The calcined zeolites were activated in steam (30 vol% H2O in 30 ml STP N2 min1) for 5 h at different temperatures, ranging from 673 to 1273 K. Throughout this paper, the catalysts are denoted making reference to the framework composition,i.e., FeAlMFI, FeGaMFI, FeGeMFI, and FeMFI, followed by the temperature of the steam treatment, e.g., FeAlMFI
(873 K).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The chemical composition of the samples was deter- mined by ICP-OES (Perkin-Elmer Plasma 40 (Si) and Op- tima 3000DV (axial)). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out on a Philips CM 30 T electron microscope with a LaB6 filament as the source of electrons operated at 300 kV. The zeolites were amor- phized by the electron beam in order to enhance the visibility of the small iron oxide particles. Ex situ UV/vis-DRS (dif- fuse reflectance spectroscopy) measurements of the steamed iron zeolites without any pretreatment were performed with a Cary 400 spectrometer (Varian) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory (Praying Mantis, Harrick). To reduce light absorption, samples were diluted with α-Al2O3 (cal- cined at 1473 K for 4 h) in a ratio of 1:3. The measured spectra were converted into KubelkaMunk functions.
2.3. Steady-state studies
Catalytic activity was measured in a parallel-test unit with five fixed-bed quartz reactors (5 mm i.d.), using 50 mg of catalyst (125200 m) and space times of 3 × 105 and 9 × 105 g s mol1 at a total pressure of P = 1 bar. The space time is defined as the ratio W/F(N2O)o, where W is the cat- alyst mass and F(N2O)o is the molar flow of N2O at the reactor inlet. Feed mixtures containing N2O (1.5 mbar), CO (01.5 mbar), and NO (01.5 mbar) in He were applied. Be- fore reaction, the catalysts were pretreated in He at 773 K for 1 h and cooled in that gas flow to the initial reaction temper- ature. The temperature was increased at intervals of 25 K in the range 475900 K. This cycle was followed by a stepwise decrease of temperature in 25 K intervals. In this tempera- ture range deactivation of the catalysts was absent and up 514

and down cycles lead to very similar activity curves. Gener- ally, 1 h after a change of conditions (temperature and feed composition), the conversions of the various reactants were constant and considered as the steady state.
Steady-state kinetic studies of direct N2O decomposition were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (7 mm i.d.) us- ing a catalyst amount of 2535 mg (125200 m), and a feed mixture of 1.5 mbar N2O in He at atmospheric pressure. The total flow rate and reaction temperature were varied between 60 and 240 ml STP min1 and 673 and 773 K, respectively.
The space time was adjusted to keep the degree of N2O con- version below 5%. This enables a proper estimation of rates of oxygen formation (molecules O2 s1 g1) according to rO2 = FTC(O2) Wcat
NA,
where FT is the total volumetric flow, C(O2) is the oxygen concentration at the reactor outlet, Wcat is the catalyst mass,and NA is the Avogadro number.
The reactant and product gases were analyzed with a GC (Chrompack CP 9001) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector, using a Poraplot Q column (for CO2 and N2O sepa- ration) and a Molsieve 5A column (for N2, O2, and CO sepa- ration), and a chemiluminescence NONO2 analyzer (Sigma VL). In the experiments, the mass balances of N, C, and O closed at > 98%.
2.4. Transient studies
Transient experiments were performed in the Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) reactor, a pulse technique with a time resolution in the submillisecond range. The TAP-2 re- actor system has been described in detail elsewhere [27]. The catalyst (50 mg, 125200 m) was packed between two lay- ers of quartz spheres of the same size fraction in the quartz reactor (6 mm i.d.). Prior to the experiments, the catalyst was pretreated in flowing He (50 ml STP min1) at 773 K and atmospheric pressure for 5 h. The pretreated sample was then exposed to vacuum (105 Pa) and pulse experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 523823 K. Gas mixtures of N2O:Ne = 1:1 and 13CO:Xe = 1:1 were pulsed into the TAP reactor via two high-speed valves, using a pulse size of 5 × 1014 molecules (Knudsen diffusion regime). Un- der this diffusion regime, interaction of molecules in the gas phase is minimized, so purely heterogeneous reaction steps are investigated. In the TAP experiments, 100 pulses of the respective reactant(s) were given over the He-pretreated catalyst as a second pretreatment in order to obtain stable transient responses of the different species involved. Sub- sequently, 10 pulses were recorded and averaged for each AMU to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The transient re- sponses were typically normalized for a better comparison of pulse shapes, which is essential for deriving mechanis- tic insights into the reactions investigated (see Sections 3.4 and 3.5).
The gases applied in the experiments, Ne (4.5), Xe (4.0), N2O (2.0), and 13CO (99 at.% 13C, Aldrich), were used with- out additional purification. The transient responses at the reactor outlet were monitored using a quadrupole mass spec- trometer (Hiden Analytical), at atomic mass units (AMUs) related to N2O (m/e 44), N2 (m/e 28), O2 (m/e 32),13CO(m/e 29), 13CO2 (m/e 45), Ne (m/e 20), and Xe (m/e 132). The variations in feed components and reaction products were determined from the respective AMUs using standard fragmentation patterns and sensitivity factors.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Performance of steamed iron zeolites in N2O
decomposition Table 1 shows the chemical composition of the calcined FeMFI zeolites. The values obtained in the solids were very similar to the nominal values in the synthesis gels and did not experience significant changes upon steam treatment at different temperatures. Importantly, the samples have a very similar iron content (0.60.7 wt% Fe), which enables a proper comparison of performances in relation to the form(s) of iron in the catalysts.
As shown in Fig. 1, the N2O conversion over the steam- activated iron zeolites measured at 748 K exhibits a maxi- mum, whose position depends on the steaming temperature and the composition of the framework. Two groups of iron zeolites can be differentiated, characterized by the presence of a trivalent cation like Al or Ga or its absence. The opti- mal temperature is much lower for FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI (ca. 900 K) than for FeGeMFI and FeMFI (ca. 1150 K).
Steam treatment of isomorphously substituted iron zeo- lites is a crucial step for creating active species for N2O ac- tivation, causing the dislodgement of framework iron to ex- traframework positions [35,19,28]. Framework Fe species are saturated with oxygen of the zeolite lattice, being unable to coordinate atomic oxygen species (from N2O). A partic- ular steaming temperature induces a certain distribution of iron species in the samples (Section 3.2), which determines the catalytic performance in Fig. 1. It can be tentatively reasoned that below the optimal temperature, the amount of iron in the zeolite framework represents a large fraction of the total iron in the sample (insufficient Fe extraction),while above the optimal temperature, extraframework iron has massively clustered into large iron oxide particles at Table 1 Chemical composition of the calcined iron zeolites Sample Si (wt%) Al (wt%) Ga (wt%) Ge (wt%) Fe (wt%) FeAlMFI

Conditions: 1.5 mbar N2O in He, W/F (N2O)o = 9 × 105 g s mol1, and P = 1 bar. the outer surface of the zeolite crystal (excessive Fe clus- tering). The 200250 K lower optimal steaming temperature in FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI for N2O decomposition suggests that the presence of aluminum and gallium in the zeolite lattice induces an easier escape of framework iron to ex- traframework positions, as compared to the GeSi and Si lattices. In any case, the conversion over the four zeolites at optimal activation conditions is fairly similar, indicating that the catalytic activity can be modulated to the same level pro- vided that the sample is properly activated. Consequently,a similar iron constitution in the zeolites at their optimal ac- tivation condition can be suggested.
3.2. Characterization of iron species
Characterization by ex situ UV/vis and HRTEM was ap- plied to determine the nature and distribution of iron species and more particularly to assess the degree of iron cluster- ing in the Fe zeolites steamed at 873 and 1173 K. These temperatures were chosen attending to the position of the optimum in Fig. 1 for both groups of samples. The visual ap- pearance of the Fe zeolites steamed at 873 K already points to a different constitution with respect to iron. FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI are light brownish, which indicates a certain ac- cumulation of iron oxide/hydroxide in the zeolite. FeGeMFI and FeMFI were nearly white, suggesting the more isolated nature of the iron species in these catalysts. In agreement, the HRTEM micrographs of FeAlMFI (873 K) and FeGaMFI (873 K) in Fig. 2 show the presence of iron oxide nanoparti- cles with a homogeneous size distribution (12 nm), which were not visible in FeGeMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (873 K).
As reported previously [5], steam treatment of FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI at 873 K not only leads to a complete dislodg- ment of framework iron to extralattice positions, but also induces an extensive extraction of aluminum and gallium species by hydrolysis of SiO(H)M (M = Al, Ga, Fe) bonds.
Accordingly, the presence of Al (or Ga) in the iron oxide nanoparticles cannot be totally excluded.
The UV/vis spectra of FeAlMFI (873 K) and FeGaMFI (873 K) in Fig. 3 show two intense Fe3+ O charge- transfer (CT) bands at 250 and 300 nm, as well as a smaller Fig. 2. HRTEM micrographs of iron zeolites steamed at 873 and 1173 K in 30 vol% H2O in N2 flow for 5 h. 516

Bands between 200 and 300 nm are typically attributed to isolated Fe3+ species, either tetrahedrally coordinated in the zeolite framework or with higher coordination [2932]. Octahedral Fe3+ ions in small oligonuclear Fe3+ x Oy complexes give rise to broad bands between 300 and 450 nm and bands above 450 nm are char- acteristic of Fe3+ ions in large iron oxide aggregates [29,32],which are likely associated to the nanoparticles identified by
HRTEM. Accordingly, a significant degree of iron clustering
can be concluded in the Al- and Ga-containing zeolites. The UV/vis spectra of FeMFI (873 K) and FeGeMFI (873 K) display a single CT band at 236 nm, indicating that the ma- jority of Fe3+ species in the samples is well isolated. The contribution at 300 nm indicates a relatively small degree of iron association in the sample in the form of oligomeric species. No contribution > 450 nm is observed, which ex- cludes the occurrence of severe iron clustering. This is in agreement with the absence of iron oxide particles in the HRTEM micrographs of these samples in Fig. 2. Deconvo- lution of UV/vis bands according to the procedure described in [32] has established that the relative percentage of iso- lated ions, oligonuclear species, and iron oxide particles in FeAlMFI (873 K) was 30%:62%:8%, in contrast with the values obtained for FeMFI (873 K) (70%:30%:0%). This quantification did not account for the dependence of the ex- tinction coefficient on the wavelength and the contribution of eventual Fe2+ present in the nonpretreated samples [32], but nevertheless provides valuable information about the distri- bution of the various iron species in the catalysts.
An accurate assessment of the architecture of the generi- cally denoted FexOy oligomers cannot be provided from the above characterization. In fact, the light absorption above 300 nm in the UV/vis spectra of the clustered samples occurs in a very broad range, even overlapping with the contribu- tion of larger Fe2O3 particles. This indicates the presence of a broad, heterogeneous distribution of oligonuclear clusters with different sizes and/or structures, rather than a well- defined nuclearity. Accordingly, the above-noted deconvolu- tion of the subbands reflects a semiquantitative distribution of different cluster geometries rather than representing a cer- tain number of different individual clustered species.Whether the band in the high-energy range (200300 nm) of UV/vis spectra in Fig. 3 belongs to isolated species in framework or extraframework positions cannot be a pri- ori discerned. CT bands of tetrahedral iron incorporated in the framework of silicalite have been observed at 215 and 241 nm [29] and a band at 286 nm has been observed from isolated Fe3+ species in octahedral coordination in Al2O3 [30]. The studies in [5,26] concluded that extrac- tion of framework iron in the Al and Ga-containing zeolites steamed at 873 K was complete and accordingly the contri- bution at 250300 nm is purely attributed to extraframework isolated Fe3+ ions. Contrarily, a small fraction of iron re- mains in the zeolite framework of FeMFI (873 K), as qualita- tively derived from electrochemical characterization of iron species in these zeolites [5]. A recent in situ UV/vis analysis of this sample after reduction in H2 at 773 K has further con- firmed the extensive dislodgement of framework iron species upon steaming of FeMFI at 873 K, based on distinct reduc- tion characteristics of both types of isolated iron ions [32].
Increasing the steaming temperature of FeGeMFI and FeMFI to 1173 K leads to the complete extraction of frame- work iron atoms [5], obtaining light brownish samples, with a similar appearance to FeAlMFI (873 K) and FeGaMFI (873 K). This indicates iron clustering, which is substan- tiated by the reduced CT band associated to isolated iron ions in UV/vis, and the appearance of bands at 350 nm and at 500 nm. Associated to this, iron oxide nanoparti- cles are observed in the corresponding HRTEM micrographs (Fig. 2). Steam treatment of FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI at 1173 K leads to a significantly increased contribution of large iron oxide particles in UV/vis, and their average size

Deconvolution of the UV/vis subbands assigned to iso- lated ions, oligonuclear species, and iron oxide particles has provided relative percentages of 35%:58%:7% in FeMFI (1173 K) and of 15%:55%:20% for FeAlMFI (1173 K). The iron distributions obtained in FeMFI (1173 K) and FeAlMFI (873 K) are rather similar, further supporting the resem- blance of the nature and distribution of iron species in both groups of catalysts at their optimal treatment in Fig. 1.
No definitive conclusions on the oxidation state of iron associated to these species can be drawn from the ex situ UV/vis technique applied in this study. A more extensive analysis of the redox processes associated to the iron species in the samples steamed at 873 K upon treatment in differ- ent atmospheres (air, H2, N2O, and CO) was carried out elsewhere by means of in situ UV/vis and EPR spectro- scopies [32].
3.3. Optimal activation of iron zeolites
The mechanism of iron extraction by steaming in isomor- phously substituted iron zeolites is far from being a simple and completely understood process [5,33,34]. In a simpli- fied way, it can be considered as a clustering process as schematically shown in Fig. 4, whose extent basically de- pends on the steaming conditions and composition of the zeolite framework. The activation temperature should be carefully adjusted to achieve the optimal distribution of iron species, achieving the extraction of inactive framework iron but preventing extensive clustering into inactive iron oxide particles. The results in Fig. 1 unequivocally show that the conversion of the four steamed zeolites in direct N2O de- composition is very close, provided that the samples are properly activated. Under the optimal activation conditions,both groups of zeolites investigated show a certain degree of iron association, characterized by a substantial amount of oligonuclear iron oxo clusters. However, a state with 100% of such iron without formation of iron oxide was not achieved and a heterogeneous distribution of iron species af- ter the activation process is normally obtained. Iron cluster- ing was largely minimized in FeGeMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (873 K), and the majority of iron is in the form of isolated ions. Clustering was not totally prevented in these samples as denoted by the contribution of oligonuclear species in the UV/vis spectra, although formation of large iron oxide par- ticles is suppressed. Besides, a certain fraction of iron is not extracted, remaining in framework positions. These results evidence the extreme difficulty in achieving a uniform dis- tribution of a certain iron site in Fe zeolites, although the distribution of iron species can be to some extent tailored by carefully adjusting the activation conditions.
The combination of zeolites with different lattice compo- sitions and activation conditions with characterization and steady-state activity results enables us to conclude that the zeolites with a larger fraction of extraframework isolated iron ions are less active in direct N2O decomposition than those with a larger fraction of oligonuclear clusters. In fact,it is well possible that the activity displayed by FeGeMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (873 K) is due to the presence of a certain fraction of oligonuclear iron species, although a con- tribution of isolated iron ions cannot be excluded.
The significantly lower optimal steaming temperature of the Al and Ga-containing FeMFI zeolites makes their practi- cal application for direct N2O decomposition more conceiv- able and also indicates a dramatic effect of the zeolite frame- work composition on the optimal activation conditions. This is a relevant point to be considered in studies claiming the superior activity of FeZSM-5 vs Fesilicalite (and in gen- eral neutral zeolite matrices) in the N2O-mediated oxidation of benzene to phenol [3,3436]. These investigations have applied the same activation temperature for both framework compositions, which does not enable an equitable compari- son due to their markedly different optimal steaming condi- tions.
3.4. Mechanism and kinetics of direct N2O decomposition
The characterization and activity studies presented above demonstrate that the form(s) of iron in the zeolite determines the catalytic activity in direct N2O decomposition, and sub- sequently triggers the question: why oligonuclear clusters are more suited to the reaction as compared with isolated iron ions.
In order to provide experimental evidence on the relation- ship between the intrinsic mechanism of the N2O decompo- sition reaction and the optimal iron site in the Fe zeolite,transient mechanistic and steady-state kinetic studies were conducted. As generally accepted, the N2O decomposition is initiated by the activation of N2O on a vacant site, leading to atomic Ospecies [Eq. (1)]. Two different mechanisms were postulated for regeneration of the active site [37,38]:the reaction of a second N2O molecule with the oxidized site [Eq. (2)] and the recombination of adsorbed oxygen atoms 518

[Eq. (3)]. Since N2O decomposition over Fe zeolites is not inhibited by O2, Eq. (3) is considered to be irreversible [38].

(3) The TAP reactor was used to investigate the formation of O2 during N2O decomposition, an essential step in the overall reaction mechanism. Under vacuum conditions in the TAP reactor, Fe zeolites decomposed N2O without forma- tion of gas-phase O2 in the temperature range of 523673 K,or gave a very broad feature, which is comparable to the noise in the mass spectrometer. Significant amounts of oxy- gen were observed above 773 K. Typical transient responses of N2O, N2, and O2 during N2O decomposition at 773 K over FeAlMFI (873 K) are presented in Fig. 5. The N2 re- sponse follows directly that of N2O, while the O2 response is broader and considerably shifted to longer times. This important mechanistic feature indicates that during N2O de- composition, N2 formation is faster than O2 formation. In this experiment, the N2/O2 ratio at the reactor outlet was ca. 3, indicating a certain consumption of oxygen by the ze- olite.
It is widely accepted that removal of oxygen from the catalyst surface is the rate-determining step during N2O de- composition. Accordingly, the high activity of the steamed zeolites with a certain degree of iron association in the form of oligonuclear species could be associated with the mech- anism of O2 formation. Nobukawa et al. [39] claimed the occurrence of Eq. (2) based on results from an 18O-tracer technique at 693 K and atmospheric pressure over a liquid ion-exchanged FeZSM-5 catalyst. This would imply a sur- prising double function of N2O as an oxidant [Eq. (1)] and as a reductant [Eq. (2)], as postulated in early N2O decom- position studies over Fe zeolites [37]. However, in view of Fig. 6. Transient responses of O2 during continuous pulsing of N2O:Ne =
1:1 (at 2.1 s) in the TAP reactor at 823 K over steam-activated iron zeolites.
the uncoupling of the N2 and O2 responses in Fig. 5, it can be ruled out that surface oxygen species react directly with N2O according to Eq. (2) under TAP conditions. O2 should then be formed by the slow recombination and desorption of surface oxygen atoms, according to Eq. (3). This is in agree- ment with previous studies under vacuum using the Multi- track reactor in the temperature range of 573973 K [40],and also with recent works by Pirngruber [41] over FeZSM-5 prepared by sublimation and by Bulushev et al.

A valuable correlation can be derived between the shape of the oxygen signal during single pulsing of N2O in the TAP reactor and the activity of the zeolites in direct N2O decomposition. The optimally activated FeAlMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (1173 K) catalysts exhibit very similar and sharp oxygen transient responses during N2O decomposi- tion (Fig. 6), as compared to the broad response obtained over the less active FeMFI (873 K). This is a clear indi- cation of an accelerated oxygen desorption process in the catalysts containing clusters, a significantly slower process in the catalysts with a larger fraction of isolated sites. The N2O conversion in the TAP experiments was also quantified from the amount of N2O disappeared, resulting in ca. 75% over FeAlMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (1173 K) and ca. 60% over FeMFI (873 K), evidencing a good concordance be- tween the performance of the iron zeolites in steady-state and transient studies.
The mechanism of oxygen formation under transient con- ditions in vacuum can differ from that under steady-state experiments at ambient pressure. In order to bridge pulse (TAP) and flow techniques, steady-state kinetic experiments were performed in the temperature range of 623823 K un- der flow conditions at 1 bar. These experiments aimed at the determination of the activation energy for oxygen formation

The Arrhenius plot of the rate of O2 formation during N2O decomposition at different temperatures is presented in Fig. 7. The results show simi- lar reaction rates for O2 production over FeAlMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (1173 K), as compared to the lower values over FeMFI (873 K). The apparent activation energy of O2 for- mation, determined from the slope of the Arrhenius plot, is significantly higher over FeMFI (873 K) (215 kJ mol1) than over FeAlMFI (873 K) (178 kJ mol1) and FeMFI (1173 K) (182 kJ mol1). This indicates that O2 formation during di- rect N2O decomposition over FeMFI (873 K) is energeti- cally less favorable than over the (more active) latter ones,due to a very slow recombination of atomic oxygen and thus a low rate of O2 desorption. Thus, as regards O2 formation during N2O decomposition, conclusions from transient and steady-state experiments are in excellent agreement too.
The mechanistic and kinetic aspects derived from tran- sient pulse and steady-state experiments explain the high activity of iron zeolites with a certain degree of iron asso- ciation in the form of oligonuclear clusters and the relative inactivity of isolated iron ions in extraframework positions.
Oligonuclear iron species appear to facilitate molecular oxy- gen desorption by recombination of atomic oxygen species at the lowest temperature, in view of the close proximity of iron centers as compared with isolated iron species. Iso- lated species may contribute at higher temperature. This would likely involve migration of atomic oxygen through the zeolite for O2 desorption, which can be activated at a higher temperature. The mechanism of N2O decomposition over these species may involve transport of atomic oxygen through vacancies in the zeolite matrix, which can be ac- tivated at high temperatures. In fact, not only oligonuclear iron species could act as a temporary storage for the first oxygen atom, but even the zeolite matrix can act as such,important in the case of isolated iron species. Evidence for this can be deduced from experiments with 18O-labeled N2O [43,44]. In these experiments much more 18O could be ac- commodated in the sample than there was Fe present (7 Fig. 8. N2O conversion vs T over steam-activated iron zeolites in direct N2O decomposition (1.5 mbar N2O in He) and N2O reduc- tion with CO (1.5 mbar N2O and 1.0 mbar CO in He). Conditions: W/F (N2O)o = 9 × 105 g s mol1 and P = 1 bar. times more). Iron was proposed as a porthole through which the 18O was transferred to its direct vicinity of the zeolite matrix. Most of the oxygen will not be present as ex- cess, but is probably exchanged; this indicates the dynamics of the oxygen in the Fe catalyst. Finally, it should be noted that not only the presence of neighboring iron ions can ex- plain the facilitated O2 desorption over oligonuclear clusters,but also the weaker nature of the FeO bond (as a result of N2O activation) in oxo clusters as compared to isolated ions.
3.5. Reduction of N2O by CO
Fig. 8 compares the N2O conversion vs T of various zeolites under steady-state conditions in direct N2O decom- position and N2O reduction with CO. The activity of the optimally activated FeAlMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (1173 K) for direct N2O decomposition is very similar in the whole temperature range, while the N2O conversion over FeMFI (873 K) is shifted 40 K to higher temperatures. Addition of CO to the feed mixture lowers the operation temperature of the catalysts with respect to direct N2O decomposition. This is generally attributed to the accelerated removal of adsorbed oxygen species from the catalyst surface in the presence of an efficient reducing agent like CO [7,45].
However, the activity order in direct N2O decomposition and N2O reduction with CO over the catalysts in Fig. 8 dif- fers. In the later reaction, FeMFI (873 K) is more active than FeMFI (1123 K) and FeAlMFI (873 K), particularly in the low-temperature range (500600 K). Above 873 K,the activity curves of the catalysts converge. Not only the N2O conversion is enhanced over FeMFI (873 K), but also the conversion of CO to CO2 (not shown). This indicates that conversions of N2O and reducing agent are activated and effectively coupled, as concluded earlier [32]. In the N2O + CO mixture, a transition is visible at ca. 700 K, when the limiting reactant CO becomes exhausted (66% N2O 520

conversion). Consequently, the N2O conversion curve grad- ually shifts from N2O reduction with CO [Eq. (4)] to direct N2O decomposition [Eq. (5)].

(5) Prez-Ramrez et al. [32] have recently concluded by application of in situ EPR and UV/vis spectroscopic tech- niques that both isolated iron ions and oligonuclear iron clusters participate in the N2O reduction with CO over dif- ferently prepared FeMFI zeolites. The reaction mechanism is site dependent. Over isolated species, the reduction of N2O with CO occurs via coordinated CO species on Fe3+ ions [Eqs. (6) and (7)], while the reaction over oligonuclear clusters proceeds via a redox Fe3+/Fe2+ process with inter- mediate formation of oxygen radicals [Eq. (8)].

(8) An resonable correlation was found between the relative amount of isolated Fe3+ ions in the differently prepared Fe zeolites and their N2O conversion indicative of a prepon- derant role of isolated sites in the N2OCO reaction [32].
Accordingly, the higher activity of FeMFI (873 K) in the reduction of N2O with CO can be related to the relatively high concentration of isolated iron species and the mini- mized degree of clustering in this sample. The small re- maining fraction of framework iron in FeMFI (873 K) is inactive for N2O activation, so their controlled extraction as isolated sites could even lead to higher activity differences in Fig. 8. This is a difficult task for the reasons discussed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.
The Temporal Analysis of Products technique was ap- plied to investigate the mechanism of products formation during N2O reduction with CO. To this end, N2O:Ne and
13CO:He mixtures were simultaneously pulsed over FeMFI
(873 K) at 673 K (Fig. 9). Isotopically labeled 13CO and nonlabeled 14N2O were used to uncouple the analysis of N2OCO2 and CON2 in mass spectrometry. The use of the most abundant isotopes for dinitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide, i.e., 14N2O and 12CO, makes it impossible due to the identical main AMUs of 14N2O and 12CO2 (44) and 14N2 and 12CO (28).
The transient responses in Fig. 9a show that the reaction products of Eq. (5), i.e., carbon dioxide and nitrogen, appear at the same time and are nicely coupled. This strongly con- trasts with the delay of the O2 response with respect to that of N2 during single pulsing of N2O over iron zeolites (Fig. 5).
Accordingly, the rate of N2O reduction by CO is extremely faster than that of N2O decomposition, due to the slow re- combination of adsorbed atomic oxygen species in the latter process. The difference in the tail of the 13CO2 and N2 re- sponses observed in Fig. 9a has no chemical (mechanistic) Fig. 9. Transient responses of N2O, N2, and 13CO2 during simultaneous pulsing of N2O:Ne = 1:1 and 13CO:Xe = 1:1 over FeMFI (873 K) in the TAP reactor at 673 K vs (a) time or (b) time normalized by the molecular diffusion coefficient of the corresponding species. nature, being due to the different diffusion coefficient of both species. This is demonstrated in Fig. 9b, where the profiles have been normalized by the molecular diffusion coefficient of the different species (tD), leading to identical responses.
These results clearly evidence the different mechanism of O-removal in both type of N2O conversions (decomposition and reduction), being linked with different optimal iron sites.
3.6. Influence of NO on N2O conversions
Fig. 10 shows the effect of NO on the conversion of N2O vs T over FeAlMFI (873 K) in different feed mixtures, con- taining N2O, N2O + NO, N2O + CO, and N2O + CO + NO, using equimolar amounts of the various reactants. In the absence of NO and CO, the catalyst shows significant N2O conversions above 700 K and complete conversions at 850 K. Addition of NO enhances the N2O decomposi- tion activity over the catalyst, achieving similar conversions

Conditions: W/F (N2O)o = 3 × 105 g s mol1 and P = 1 bar. at 75 K lower temperature. An even significantly lower catalyst operation temperature is obtained by addition of CO to the N2O/He feed, leading to complete N2O conversions at 700 K, 100 K lower compared to the N2O + NO system and 150 K with respect to the N2O system. The presence of NO inhibits the reduction of N2O with CO. The N2O con- version is shifted to higher temperatures and approaches the activity of the N2O + NO system, particularly at tempera- tures < 625 K. The negative effect of NO in the selective catalytic reduction of N2O with C3H8 in the presence of ex- cess oxygen has also been reported [22].The relevance of the results in Fig. 10 focuses on the dual role of NO in N2O conversions, acting as a promotor in direct N2O decomposition and as an inhibitor in N2O re- duction with CO. This further supports the participation of different iron sites in both decomposition and reduction of
N2O. At low temperatures, the adsorption of NO on iron
sites in the zeolite is relatively strong [46] and may block iron ions and oligonuclear iron clusters for CO and N2O acti- vation, respectively, so that the occurrence of Eqs. (6)(8) is restricted. In view of the preponderance of isolated iron ions in the N2O reduction with CO at low temperatures, it can be suggested that the inhibition occurs mainly over isolated iron sites. As a consequence of the inhibited CO activation on isolated sites, the low-temperature activity in annihilated.
The N2O conversion is shifted to higher temperatures, being dominated by the NO-assisted N2O decomposition mecha- nism over oligonuclear iron species. This result nicely sub- stantiates previous mechanistic studies [40,47], where it was concluded that NO-assisted N2O decomposition requires a close proximity of adsorbed NO and O (from N2O) species for a facilitated O2 desorption via adsorbed NO2 intermedi- ates. The active participation of isolated iron ions in direct N2O decomposition (with or without NO) as well as the no inhibition by NO in the reduction of N2O with CO could be envisaged if various open coordinations would be available in these sites. However, this can be excluded based on previ- ous infrared studies in combination with NO adsorption over the steam-activated iron zeolites [46].
4. Conclusions
Based on (i) the synthesis and characterization of iron species in steam-activated FeMFI zeolites with different framework compositions and activation conditions, (ii) test- ing in various N2O conversions, and (iii) transient mecha- nistic and steady-state kinetic studies, relevant correlations between the intrinsic reaction mechanism and the nature of the optimal (active) iron site(s) have been derived. The re- sults have shown that the reaction mechanism determines the preferred iron site(s), which can be modulated by tun- ing the steaming temperature during activation. The optimal activation is a function of the reaction in question and the framework composition of the iron zeolite. Recombination of adsorbed atomic oxygen species followed by O2 desorp- tion is rate-determining step in direct N2O decomposition,being favored over oligonuclear iron oxo clusters and seri- ously handicapped over isolated iron ions. The mechanism of oxygen desorption from the catalyst surface strongly dif- fers in the presence of reducing agents like CO. In this case,the rate of oxygen removal as CO2 is much faster as com- pared to direct N2O decomposition, being coupled with the rate of N2 production. The role of isolated iron ions as ac- tive sites in the reduction of N2O with CO is preponderant.
The participation of different sites in both types of N2O con- versions reactions was also supported by experiments in the presence of NO. Apparently NO selectively inhibits N2O re- duction over isolated sites and evidence the essential role of oligonuclear iron clusters in the NO-assisted N2O decompo- sition.
