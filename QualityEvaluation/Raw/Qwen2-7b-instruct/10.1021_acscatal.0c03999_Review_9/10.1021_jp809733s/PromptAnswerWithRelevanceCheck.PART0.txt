<p>In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr. The lower selectivity to propene on sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr is probably related to the presence of some amount of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites.</p>
<p>The propane conversion is lower in the presence of N2O and reaches only 3% at 673 K for Cr3.4SiBEA. In contrast, the selectivity to propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.</p>

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the conversion of propane increases with the chromium content when air is used as the oxidant. The highest selectivity towards propene is observed for the catalyst with 1.0 wt% chromium content. The lower selectivity for the catalyst with 3.4 wt% chromium might be due to the presence of some extra-framework octahedral chromium sites.

2. The propane conversion is lower when N2O is used as the oxidant compared to air. At a reaction temperature of 673 K, the propane conversion reaches only 3% for the catalyst with 3.4 wt% chromium. The selectivity towards propene is higher in the presence of N2O than when air is used. This difference in selectivity might be due to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中，当使用空气作为氧化剂时，丙烷转化率随铬含量增加而提高。1.0 wt% 铬含量的催化剂表现出最高的丙烯选择性。对于含3.4 wt% 铬的催化剂，选择性较低可能是因为存在一些额外框架八面体铬位点。

2. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，丙烷转化率较低，相比空气。在673 K的反应温度下，丙烷转化率仅达到3%。当使用N2O时，丙烯的选择性比使用空气时更高。这种选择性的差异可能与反应条件下铬的还原程度和N2O或空气表面氧的性质有关。

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions are C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. According to the literature, increasing chromium content leads to increased propane conversion and selectivity towards propene in the presence of air. However, the selectivity towards propene decreases slightly with a higher chromium content of 3.4 wt%. In the presence of N2O, the conversion of propane is lower compared to air, but the selectivity towards propene is higher due to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能。不同反应条件下的关键性能指标是C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。根据文献，随着铬含量的增加，在空气存在下的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性提高。然而，3.4 wt%的铬含量会导致丙烯选择性的轻微下降。在N2O存在下，丙烷转化率低于空气，但丙烯选择性更高，这可能与反应条件下铬的还原程度以及N2O或空气中表面氧的性质有关。

1. For a sample with 0.2 Cr wt %, the propane conversion was very low, with COx being the main product.
2. Increasing the Cr content to 1.0 wt % led to a significant increase in the selectivity towards propene, reaching approximately 50%.
3. Further increasing the Cr content to 3.4 wt % resulted in a slight decrease in selectivity towards propene.
4. When N2O was used as an oxidant, the propane conversion on activated CrxSiBEA was notably lower compared to using air.
5. Maintaining high selectivity in the presence of air or N2O requires the presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites with an oxidation state lower than (VI) on activated CrxSiBEA.

1. 对于0.2 Cr wt %的样品，丙烷转化率很低，主要产物为COx。
2. 将Cr含量增加到1.0 wt %导致丙烯选择性显著提高，达到约50%。
3. 进一步将Cr含量增加到3.4 wt %导致丙烯选择性略有下降。
4. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，激活后的CrxSiBEA对丙烷的转化率明显低于使用空气的情况。
5. 在空气或N2O存在下维持高选择性的关键在于激活后的CrxSiBEA上存在的孤立四面体Cr位点的氧化态低于（VI）。

1. The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % exhibits a notably low propane conversion, primarily yielding COx.
2. As the Cr content rises to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity towards propene improves to approximately 50%, and further enhancement to 3.4 wt % leads to a slight decline.
3. The low propane conversion might stem from a scarce quantity of isolated octahedral Cr(III) in the activated CrxSiBEA.
4. The presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites appears crucial for sustaining high selectivity towards propene, aligning with prior findings on Cr on supported mesoporous MCM-41 silica.
