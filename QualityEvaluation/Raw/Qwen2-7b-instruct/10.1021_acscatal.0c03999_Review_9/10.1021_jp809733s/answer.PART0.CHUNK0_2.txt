1. For a sample with 0.2 Cr wt %, the propane conversion was very low, with COx being the main product.
2. Increasing the Cr content to 1.0 wt % led to a significant increase in the selectivity towards propene, reaching approximately 50%.
3. Further increasing the Cr content to 3.4 wt % resulted in a slight decrease in selectivity towards propene.
4. When N2O was used as an oxidant, the propane conversion on activated CrxSiBEA was notably lower compared to using air.
5. Maintaining high selectivity in the presence of air or N2O requires the presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites with an oxidation state lower than (VI) on activated CrxSiBEA.

1. 对于0.2 Cr wt %的样品，丙烷转化率很低，主要产物为COx。
2. 将Cr含量增加到1.0 wt %导致丙烯选择性显著提高，达到约50%。
3. 进一步将Cr含量增加到3.4 wt %导致丙烯选择性略有下降。
4. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，激活后的CrxSiBEA对丙烷的转化率明显低于使用空气的情况。
5. 在空气或N2O存在下维持高选择性的关键在于激活后的CrxSiBEA上存在的孤立四面体Cr位点的氧化态低于（VI）。
