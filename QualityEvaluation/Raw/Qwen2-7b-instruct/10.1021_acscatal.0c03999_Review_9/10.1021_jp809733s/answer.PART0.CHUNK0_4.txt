[1] "The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % shows a very low propane conversion (Figure 8) with COx as main product (Figure 10)."
[2] "When the Cr content increases to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity toward propene increases to about 50%, while further increase to 3.4 wt % results in a small decrease."
[3] "The low propane conversion may originate from a very low concentration of isolated octahedral Cr(III) present in activated CrxSiBEA."
[4] "It seems, that the presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites is essential for maintaining high selectivity toward propene, which is in line with earlier data on Cr on supported mesoporous MCM-41 silica."

1. The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % exhibits a notably low propane conversion, primarily yielding COx.
2. As the Cr content rises to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity towards propene improves to approximately 50%, and further enhancement to 3.4 wt % leads to a slight decline.
3. The low propane conversion might stem from a scarce quantity of isolated octahedral Cr(III) in the activated CrxSiBEA.
4. The presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites appears crucial for sustaining high selectivity towards propene, aligning with prior findings on Cr on supported mesoporous MCM-41 silica.

1. 含有0.2Cr wt %的样品表现出较低的丙烷转化率，主要生成COx。
2. 当Cr含量增加到1.0 wt %时，丙烯选择性提高至约50%，进一步提升至3.4 wt %则略有下降。
3. 低丙烷转化率可能源于激活的CrxSiBEA中稀少的孤立八面体Cr(III)。
4. 存在孤立四面体Cr位点似乎对于维持高丙烯选择性至关重要，这与先前关于Cr在支持的介孔MCM-41硅上的发现相吻合。
