[1] "The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % shows a very low propane conversion (Figure 8) with COx as main product (Figure 10)."
[2] "When the Cr content increases to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity toward propene increases to about 50%, while further increase to 3.4 wt % results in a small decrease."
[3] "In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr."
[4] "The presence of isolated tetrahedral Cr sites with oxidation state lower that (VI) on activated CrxSiBEA is essential for maintaining a high selectivity in the presence of air or N2O."
[5] "The sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr shows a small decrease in selectivity toward propene compared to the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr."
[6] "In the presence of N2O, the propane conversion is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11)."

1. The sample with 0.2 wt% chromium shows a very low propane conversion, primarily yielding COx.
2. An increase in chromium content to 1.0 wt% enhances the selectivity towards propene, while a further rise to 3.4 wt% leads to a slight decline.
3. In the presence of air, propane conversion rises with chromium content, achieving the highest selectivity at 1.0 wt% chromium.
4. Maintaining high selectivity towards propene in the presence of air or N2O requires the presence of isolated tetrahedral chromium sites with an oxidation state lower than VI.
5. The sample with 3.4 wt% chromium exhibits a slight decrease in propene selectivity compared to the sample with 1.0 wt% chromium.
6. Propane conversion in the presence of N2O is significantly lower than when using air, as illustrated by comparing Figures 8 and 11.

1. 含有0.2 wt% 铬的样品表现出极低的丙烷转化率，主要产物为COx。
2. 铬含量增加到1.0 wt%，丙烯选择性提高至约50%，而进一步增加到3.4 wt%则导致轻微下降。
3. 在空气存在下，随着铬含量的增加，丙烷转化率上升，并且在1.0 wt%的铬含量下达到最高的选择性。
4. 在空气或N2O的存在下维持高丙烯选择性的关键在于含有氧化态低于VI的四面体铬位点的活性CrxSiBEA样品。
5. 含有3.4 wt%铬的样品在丙烯选择性上与含有1.0 wt%铬的样品相比显示轻微下降。
6. 使用N2O时，丙烷转化率远低于使用空气的情况，如比较图8和11所示。
