<p>In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr. The lower selectivity to propene on sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr is probably related to the presence of some amount of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites.</p>
<p>The propane conversion is lower in the presence of N2O and reaches only 3% at 673 K for Cr3.4SiBEA. In contrast, the selectivity to propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air. It is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.</p>

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the conversion of propane increases with the chromium content when air is used as the oxidant. The highest selectivity towards propene is observed for the catalyst with 1.0 wt% chromium content. The lower selectivity for the catalyst with 3.4 wt% chromium might be due to the presence of some extra-framework octahedral chromium sites.

2. The propane conversion is lower when N2O is used as the oxidant compared to air. At a reaction temperature of 673 K, the propane conversion reaches only 3% for the catalyst with 3.4 wt% chromium. The selectivity towards propene is higher in the presence of N2O than when air is used. This difference in selectivity might be due to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中，当使用空气作为氧化剂时，丙烷转化率随铬含量增加而提高。1.0 wt% 铬含量的催化剂表现出最高的丙烯选择性。对于含3.4 wt% 铬的催化剂，选择性较低可能是因为存在一些额外框架八面体铬位点。

2. 当使用N2O作为氧化剂时，丙烷转化率较低，相比空气。在673 K的反应温度下，丙烷转化率仅达到3%。当使用N2O时，丙烯的选择性比使用空气时更高。这种选择性的差异可能与反应条件下铬的还原程度和N2O或空气表面氧的性质有关。
