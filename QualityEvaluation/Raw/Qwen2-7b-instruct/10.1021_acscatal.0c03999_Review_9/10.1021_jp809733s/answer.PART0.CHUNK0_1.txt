[1] "The sample with 0.2 Cr wt % shows a very low propane conversion (Figure 8) with COx as main product (Figure 10)."
[2] "When the Cr content increases to 1.0 wt %, the selectivity toward propene increases to about 50%, while further increase to 3.4 wt % results in a small decrease."
[3] "In the presence of air, the propane conversion increases with Cr content, while the selectivity toward propene is highest for the sample with 1.0 wt % of Cr."
[4] "The lower selectivity to propene on sample with 3.4 wt % of Cr is probably related to the presence of some amount of extra-framework octahedral Cr sites."
[5] "In the presence of N2O, the conversion of propane on activated CrxSiBEA is much lower than in the presence of air (compare Figures 8 and 11) and increases with Cr content and reaction temperature."
[6] "The selectivity toward propene is higher in the presence of N2O than of air, which is probably related to the degree of Cr reduction under reaction conditions and to the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions are C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. According to the literature, increasing chromium content leads to increased propane conversion and selectivity towards propene in the presence of air. However, the selectivity towards propene decreases slightly with a higher chromium content of 3.4 wt%. In the presence of N2O, the conversion of propane is lower compared to air, but the selectivity towards propene is higher due to the degree of chromium reduction under reaction conditions and the nature of surface oxygen formed in the presence of N2O or air.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能。不同反应条件下的关键性能指标是C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。根据文献，随着铬含量的增加，在空气存在下的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性提高。然而，3.4 wt%的铬含量会导致丙烯选择性的轻微下降。在N2O存在下，丙烷转化率低于空气，但丙烯选择性更高，这可能与反应条件下铬的还原程度以及N2O或空气中表面氧的性质有关。
