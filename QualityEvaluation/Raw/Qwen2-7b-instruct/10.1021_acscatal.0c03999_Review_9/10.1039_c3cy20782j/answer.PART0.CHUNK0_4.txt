[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange was investigated as catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide, and a maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% could be obtained at the reaction temperature of 673 K."
[2] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide,extensive COx is formed as over-oxidation by-product even at moderate propane conversion, and therefore low propylene selectivity and propylene yield are usually observed."
[3] "Nitrous oxide is an alternative promising oxidant especially when iron modified zeolites, i.e. ironzeolites, are employed as catalysts."
[4] "Fezeolites with similar Si/Al ratios and different framework structures are studied as possible catalysts for the ODHP with nitrous oxide. FeFER and FeMOR exhibit quite low activity for the ODHP with nitrous oxide, while FeBEA, FeFAU and FeMFI exhibit significant ODHP activity (Fig. S2, ESI)."
[5] "Undoubtedly, the framework structure of Fezeolite plays a decisive role in the catalytic activity. FeMFI appears to be more promising catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and a maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. FeMFI, prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, showed a maximal propylene yield of approximately 14% at 673 K. This method produced a more effective catalyst compared to others like FeFER and FeMOR, which exhibited lower activity. FeBEA, FeFAU, and FeMFI demonstrated significant activity in the ODHP reaction. The framework structure of Fezeolite significantly affects catalytic activity, with FeMFI being more promising than FeFER and FeMOR. The maximal propylene yield of approximately 14% was obtained under optimized conditions.

2. Under different reaction conditions, the key performance metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of these synthesis methods include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The document indicates that FeMFI achieved a maximal propylene yield of 14% at 673 K, demonstrating its effectiveness in the ODHP reaction. The presence of extensive COx as an over-oxidation by-product even at moderate propane conversion generally leads to low propylene selectivity and yield, highlighting the importance of catalyst selection in such reactions. Nitrous oxide serves as an alternative and promising oxidant in these reactions, particularly when iron-modified zeolites, or ironzeolites, are utilized. 

3. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, specifically focusing on the preparation of FeMFI by reductive solution ion-exchange, have influenced their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. FeMFI, as evidenced by its maximal propylene yield of approximately 14% at 673 K, has proven to be more effective than FeFER and FeMOR, which showed lower activity. The document suggests that the framework structure of Fezeolite plays a critical role in determining the catalytic activity, with FeMFI being notably more promising than the other mentioned catalysts. The maximal propylene yield of approximately 14% was achieved under optimized conditions, emphasizing the importance of catalyst selection and preparation methods in achieving high yields and selectivities in the ODHP reaction.
