1. "Fezeolites with similar Si/Al ratios and different framework structures are studied as possible catalysts for the ODHP with nitrous oxide. FeMFI appears to be more promising catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and a maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K."
2. "Through solution ion exchange with ferrous salt, extra-framework iron species can be introduced to the zeolite host. Based on the characterization results from H2-TPR (Fig. 6), UV-Vis (Fig. 7) and EPR (Fig. 8), ferric ions with different nuclearity, e.g. isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, are obtained after ion exchange and subsequent calcination."
3. "The exposed iron sites in FeMFI are probed by FTIR spectra of NO adsorption and nitrosyls on auto-reduced ferrous ions are employed for the titration of iron sites. As shown in Fig. 8, the ferrous ions in oligonuclear clusters change slightly, while the formation of extra-framework Fe2+OAl species and isolated ferrous ions located at the g sites of ZSM-5 structure are quite evident during accumulative acid post-treatments."
4. "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange is active catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide and maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% can be obtained at 673 K. Acid post-treatments on FeMFI show distinct positive effects on the activity in the ODHP with nitrous oxide. Typically, the maximal propylene yield gradually increases to ca. 25% with accumulative acid post-treatments."

1. FeMFI is a more promising catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide compared to other zeolites with similar Si/Al ratios. It can achieve a maximal propylene yield of approximately 14% at 673 K.
2. Extra-framework iron species are introduced into the zeolite host through solution ion exchange with ferrous salt. Ferric ions with various nuclearities, including isolated ions, oligonuclear clusters, and Fe2O3 nanoparticles, are formed after ion exchange and subsequent calcination.
3. The iron sites on the surface of FeMFI are characterized using FTIR spectra of NO adsorption. The formation of extra-framework Fe2+OAl species and isolated ferrous ions located at the g sites of ZSM-5 structure becomes evident during acid post-treatments.
4. FeMFI, prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, is an active catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide. Acid post-treatments enhance its activity, leading to a maximal propylene yield of approximately 25% with cumulative treatments.

1. FeMFI是用于硝酸盐辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应的更有前景的催化剂，与具有相似Si/Al比的其他沸石相比。在673K时，它可以实现约14%的丙烯产率。
2. 通过使用亚铁盐溶液进行离子交换，在沸石载体中引入额外的铁物种。在离子交换和随后煅烧后，形成包括孤立离子、寡核簇和Fe2O3纳米颗粒在内的不同核态的铁物种。
3. 使用NO吸附的FTIR光谱对FeMFI表面的铁位点进行了表征。在酸后处理过程中，形成了额外的框架Fe2+OAl物种和位于ZSM-5结构的g位点的孤立铁物种。
4. 通过还原性溶液离子交换制备的FeMFI是硝酸盐辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应的活性催化剂。随着累积酸后处理的进行，其活性得到增强，最大丙烯产率达到约25%。
