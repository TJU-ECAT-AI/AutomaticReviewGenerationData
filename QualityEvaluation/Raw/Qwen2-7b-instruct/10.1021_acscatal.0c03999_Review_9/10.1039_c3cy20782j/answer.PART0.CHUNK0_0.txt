1. The synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange showed the highest catalytic performance, achieving a maximal propylene yield of 14%. Steam treatment and solid-state ion exchange resulted in lower yields compared to FeMFI.
2. Under optimal reaction conditions, FeMFI achieved a maximal propylene yield of 14% at a reaction temperature of 673 K. By performing cumulative acid post-treatments, the maximal propylene yield increased to 25%.
3. FeMFI, prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange, demonstrated superior performance compared to other Fezeolites with similar Si/Al ratios and different framework structures. It achieved a maximal propylene yield of 14% at 673 K.
4. The maximal propylene yield over FeMFI increased to 25% after applying cumulative acid post-treatments. This indicates that the post-treatments enhanced the catalytic performance of FeMFI.
