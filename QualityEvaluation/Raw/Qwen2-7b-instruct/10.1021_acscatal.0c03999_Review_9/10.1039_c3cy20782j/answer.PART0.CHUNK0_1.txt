[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange was investigated as catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide, and a maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% could be obtained at the reaction temperature of 673 K. Accumulative acid post-treatments were performed on FeMFI and a gradual increase of maximal propylene yield to ca. 25% could be observed."
[2] "For the ODHP to propylene with nitrous oxide catalyzed by ironzeolites, it is most important to know the active sites and the structure-activity relationship."
[3] "The results clearly indicated the transformation of iron species during acid post-treatments."
[4] "Based on the characterization and catalytic results, the extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species in FeMFI were proposed to be more active than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide."

1. Different synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment tends to lead to lower activity compared to liquid exchange and solid-state ion exchange. Liquid exchange method can introduce extra-framework iron species, enhancing the catalytic activity. Solid-state ion exchange, though less effective, still modifies the structure of the zeolite to improve its performance. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include the conversion of propane (C3H8), conversion of nitrous oxide (N2O), selectivity towards propylene (C3H6), and yield of propylene (C3H6).

2. The structure-activity relationship of these ironzeolite catalysts is crucial in understanding their performance in the ODHP reaction. The active sites and their distribution affect the efficiency of the reaction. The active sites are where the chemical transformations occur, leading to the formation of propylene.

3. The characterization of iron species during the acid post-treatments reveals significant changes in the structure of the catalyst. The transformation of iron species indicates that the acidity of the zeolite increases, which might enhance its catalytic properties.

4. The characterization results suggest that extra-framework FeOAl species and/or isolated iron species in FeMFI are more active than oligonuclear iron species for propane dehydrogenation with nitrous oxide. This implies that the arrangement of iron species plays a critical role in the catalytic efficiency.

5. The maximal propylene yield gradually increases with the accumulation of acid post-treatments, reaching up to approximately 25%. This indicates that the repeated treatments improve the catalytic performance of the FeMFI catalyst in the ODHP reaction.

1. 不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换，对铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能有影响。蒸汽处理通常导致活性较低，而液体交换和固体离子交换方法则可以提高活性。液体交换方法能够引入额外框架的铁物种，增强催化剂活性。固体离子交换虽然效果较差，但仍然通过改变结构来改善性能。关键性能指标包括丙烷（C3H8）转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯（C3H6）选择性和丙烯（C3H6）产率，这些指标展示了不同合成方法的有效性。

2. 铁基沸石催化剂在ODHP反应中的结构-活性关系至关重要，理解这些活性位点及其分布对于提高反应效率是必要的。活性位点是化学转化发生的地点，导致丙烯的形成。

3. 酸后处理过程中铁物种的表征揭示了催化剂结构的重要变化。铁物种的转变表明酸性提高了，这可能增强了其催化性能。

4. 表征结果显示，FeMFI中的额外框架FeOAl物种和/或孤立铁物种比寡核铁物种在丙烷氧化脱氢与N2O反应中更为活跃。这意味着铁物种的排列对催化效率起着关键作用。

5. 随着酸后处理次数的累积，最大丙烯产率逐渐增加，达到约25%。这表明FeMFI催化剂在ODHP反应中的催化性能随着重复处理而提高。
