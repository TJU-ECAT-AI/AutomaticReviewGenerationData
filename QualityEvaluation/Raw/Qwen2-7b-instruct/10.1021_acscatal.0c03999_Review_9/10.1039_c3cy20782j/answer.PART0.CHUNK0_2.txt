[1] "FeMFI prepared by reductive solution ion-exchange was investigated as catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with nitrous oxide, and a maximal propylene yield of ca. 14% could be obtained at the reaction temperature of 673 K."
[2] "For the ODHP to propylene with nitrous oxide catalyzed by ironzeolites, it is most important to know the active sites and the structure-activity relationship."
[3] "It is indicated that the presence of propane in the reaction system greatly improves the conversion of nitrous oxide catalyzed by FeMFI."
[4] "The exposed iron sites in FeMFI are probed by FTIR spectra of NO adsorption and nitrosyls on auto-reduced ferrous ions are employed for the titration of iron sites."
[5] "Unfortunately, current experiment data cannot give us exact information on either extra-framework FeOAl species or isolated iron species in the sinusoidal channels of MFI is more important for the reaction."
[6] "Therefore, it is instructive to drive iron species at framework positions or cation sites to extra-framework FeOAl species in order to obtain highly active ironzeolite catalyst for the ODHP with nitrous oxide."
