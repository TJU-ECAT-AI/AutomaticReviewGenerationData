Compared to literature data on optimized Fe-ZSM-5, FAPOcal shows relatively low activity and comparable selectivities in N2O induced propane selective oxidation. Steaming reduces the performance of this AlPO4-5 based catalyst. Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1 are less active and selective than FAPOcal. However, the stability of the investigated systems is significantly better than reported for Fe- ZSM-5. This is explained by differences in surface chemistry: operando DRIFT studies show formation of carbonates and carboxylates on the surfaces of the FAPO and TUD-1 based catalysts, rather than coke.

Reasons for the different behavior of the herein investigated catalysts as compared to Fe-ZSM-5 are discussed.

The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the activity, se- lectivity and stability of FAPO, before and after steaming, in the N2O-mediated ODHP reaction. To evaluate the nature of the active site, as well as to assess the role of the pore structure, the catalytic performance of FAPO is compared with Fe-TUD-1 and aluminum promoted Fe-TUD-1 [11,12].

The N2O-induced propane oxidative dehydrogenation was carried out in a six-flow reactor set-up. The set up, and definitions applied for conversion, selectivity, and yield were described in detail elsewhere [16].

Fig. 3 shows the turnover frequency of N2O and C3H8, and the yield to propene as a function of temperature. Around 80%, 83%, 58%, and 59% of N2O is converted at 525 C over 2FAPOcal, 2FAPOste, 2Fe-TUD-1, and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1,respectively. For the FAPO catalysts, propene is the main product with a selectivity ranging from 27 to 30% at around 44% conversion, while CO and CO2 are the main by-products and 3% is converted to the oxygenate acrolein.

The C and O mass balance of the analyses of the catalysts are not closed to 100%. Besides being related to experimental errors, this suggests that oxygenates might be accumulating on the surface of the catalysts, as will be demonstrated by the investigation of the nature and extent of deposits formed on the catalyst surface during the reaction by DRIFT spectroscopy.

Fig. 5 shows the development of infrared spectra in the region of 30004000 cm1 for 2FAPOcal against a background of the catalysts at the same temperature in He. The strongest intensity at 3665 cm1 has been assigned to Brnsted sites, i.e. POH. The weak features at 3780 cm1 and 3400 cm1 are most likely associated with AlOH and hydrogen bonded OH-groups, respectively.

Certainly features in the 1200 to 1800 cm1 region of the spectra indicate the formation of strongly bound surface adsorbed species (see Fig. 5).

Two options remain: nitrate bands have been assigned to absorp- tions in the region of 12901310 cm1. If nitrates are formed, this is most likely the result of a small fraction of NO in the N2O feed applied, which is commonly the case. Alternatively, the band might be related to phosphate vibrational modes, which are enhanced by the changes in the chemical environment of the phosphate groups upon deposition of the carboxylates.

In the experiment conducted with 2FAPOste, the IR bands are located at similar positions as observed for 2FAPOcal, besides the presence of an additional band, located at 3735 cm1. The novel band at 3735 cm1 is most likely related to ex-framework Al species, in view of literature assignments.

In Fig. 6, the development of the IR bands upon N2O induced propane oxidation as a function of time is shown for the 2Fe- TUD-1 sample. Maxima of the IR absorptions are located at 1645,1530, and 1450 cm1. In view of the product distribution, oxy- genates are likely to be the surface species causing these vibra- tions.

In conclusion, the performance of the iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange. Key performance metrics include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The stability of the catalysts, as well as the formation of carbonates, carboxylates, and oxygenates on the surface, are crucial factors that determine their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods lead to differences in the catalysts' activity, selectivity, and stability. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

For instance, FAPOcal shows relatively low activity and comparable selectivities in N2O-induced propane selective oxidation compared to literature data on optimized Fe-ZSM-5. Steaming reduces the performance of the AlPO4-5 based catalyst, while Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1 are less active and selective than FAPOcal. The stability of the investigated systems is significantly better than reported for Fe-ZSM-5, attributed to differences in surface chemistry.

Operando DRIFT studies reveal the formation of carbonates and carboxylates on the surfaces of the FAPO and TUD-1 based catalysts during the reaction, rather than coke. This explains the different behavior of the catalysts compared to Fe-ZSM-5.

The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the activity, selectivity, and stability of FAPO before and after steaming in the N2O-mediated ODHP reaction. The nature of the active site and the role of the pore structure are assessed by comparing the catalytic performance of FAPO with Fe-TUD-1 and aluminum-promoted Fe-TUD-1.

The results show that 80%, 83%, 58%, and 59% of N2O is converted at 525°C over 2FAPOcal, 2FAPOste, 2Fe-TUD-1, and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1, respectively. The FAPO catalysts produce propene as the main product with a selectivity ranging from 27 to 30% at around 44% conversion, while CO and CO2 are the main by-products, and 3% is converted to acrolein.

The C and O mass balance of the catalyst analyses are not closed to 100%, suggesting that oxygenates may accumulate on the catalyst surfaces. This is further investigated through the examination of the nature and extent of deposits formed on the catalyst surface during the reaction using DRIFT spectroscopy.

Infrared spectra developed in the region of 3000-4000 cm-1 for 2FAPOcal show the presence of Brnsted sites (POH), AlOH, and hydrogen-bonded OH-groups. Features in the 1200-1800 cm-1 region indicate the formation of strongly bound surface adsorbed species. Nitrate bands may be related to small amounts of NO in the N2O feed or phosphate vibrational modes. The novel band at 3735 cm-1 in 2FAPOste is likely associated with ex-framework Al species.

In the development of the IR bands over time for the 2Fe-TUD-1 sample, maxima are located at 1645, 1530, and 1450 cm-1, suggesting the presence of oxygenates as surface species causing these vibrations. The stability of the catalysts is influenced by the formation of carbonates, carboxylates, and oxygenates on the surface.

In summary, the synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites impact their performance in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction, affecting activity, selectivity, and stability. The performance metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, are crucial indicators of their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。这些方法导致催化剂的活性、选择性和稳定性发生变化。不同反应条件下表现的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

例如，FAPOcal在N2O诱导的丙烷选择性氧化中的活性相对较低，但选择性与优化的Fe-ZSM-5相当。蒸汽处理降低了基于AlPO4-5的催化剂的性能。Fe-TUD-1和Fe-Al-TUD-1的活性和选择性低于FAPOcal。然而，这些系统的稳定性显著优于Fe-ZSM-5的报告值。这归因于表面化学的差异：原位DRIFT研究表明，在FAPO和TUD-1基催化剂表面上形成了碳酸盐和羧酸盐，而不是焦炭。

原位DRIFT研究揭示了FAPO和TUD-1基催化剂在反应过程中表面形成了碳酸盐和羧酸盐，而非焦炭，解释了与Fe-ZSM-5相比催化剂行为的不同。

本文旨在评估在蒸气处理前后的FAPO在N2O介导的ODHP反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。通过将FAPO与Fe-TUD-1和铝促进的Fe-TUD-1进行比较，评估活性中心的性质以及孔结构的作用。

在六流反应器设置下进行了N2O诱导的丙烷氧化脱氢实验。该设置及定义转换、选择性和产出的详细信息在其他地方有描述。结果表明，在525°C下，80%、83%、58%和59%的N2O分别被2FAPOcal、2FAPOste、2Fe-TUD-1和2Fe-2Al-TUD-1转化为。FAPO催化剂主要产生丙烯作为产物，选择性范围从约44%转换时的27%到30%，而CO和CO2为主要副产物，并且3%转化为氧产物丙烯醛。

催化剂分析的C和O质量平衡未达到100%，这表明催化剂表面上可能累积了氧化合物。这一现象通过观察催化剂表面在反应期间形成的沉积物的性质和程度来进一步研究，使用DRIFT光谱技术。

在3000-4000 cm-1区域对2FAPOcal的红外光谱显示Brnsted位点（POH）、AlOH和氢键结合的OH-组的存在。1200-1800 cm-1区域的特征表明表面吸附物种的形成。硝酸盐带可能与N2O进料中少量NO相关或磷酸盐振动模式有关。2FAPOste中出现的新波长3735 cm-1最有可能与离域Al物种有关。

对于2Fe-TUD-1样品，随时间发展的红外光谱最大值位于1645、1530和1450 cm-1，暗示氧气化物作为表面物种导致这些振动。催化剂的稳定性受表面形成碳酸盐、羧酸盐和氧化合物的影响。

总之，铁基ZSM-5沸石的不同合成方法影响其在N2O辅助的ODHP反应中的性能，影响活性、选择性和稳定性。C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率是不同反应条件下表现的关键性能指标。

1. Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

2. Steam treatment improves the N2O decomposition rate of FAPO in the N2O-mediated propane ODH, enhancing its activity. However, steaming does not significantly improve the performance of FAPO compared to Fe-ZSM-5.

3. FAPO and Fe-TUD-1 catalysts exhibit lower activity and selectivity compared to mesoporous 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1. This is attributed to the presence of a considerable amount of iron clusters and oxides in the latter, suggesting that the pore structure plays a less critical role than the chemical nature of iron sites in selective N2O-induced propane oxidation.

4. The nature of deactivating surface species differs between FAPO and Fe-TUD-1 catalysts and Fe-ZSM-5, possibly explained by the surface oxygen coverage, which is higher for FAPO and Fe-TUD-1, and relatively lower for Fe-ZSM-5. This results in a slower desorption rate of surface oxygen from FAPO and Fe-TUD-1, leading to the formation of carboxylates rather than coke, which is a more common deactivating species on Fe-ZSM-5.

5. The stability of the investigated catalysts is relatively high, as indicated by the stable baseline in DRIFT measurements and the relatively low amount of coke formed. This is consistent with the small deactivation rate and formation of carboxylates, rather than coke.

6. The FAPO and Fe-TUD-1 catalysts show low coke formation and relatively little deactivation compared to Fe-ZSM-5, contributing to their stability on stream. This is attributed to the high oxygen coverage on the catalyst surfaces, which favors the formation of carboxylates over coke.

1. 不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，会影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化性能。这些催化剂的有效性通过丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率等关键性能指标来衡量。

2. 蒸汽处理可以提高FAPO在N2O介导的丙烷ODHP中的活性，改善N2O分解速率。然而，与Fe-ZSM-5相比，FAPO的性能并未显著提升。

3. FAPO和Fe-TUD-1催化剂的活性和选择性低于具有较大铁簇和氧化物的2Fe-TUD-1和2Fe-2Al-TUD-1催化剂。这可能归因于2Fe-TUD-1和2Fe-2Al-TUD-1中大量存在的铁簇，表明孔结构在选择性N2O诱导丙烷氧化中的作用不如铁位点的化学性质重要。

4. FAPO和Fe-TUD-1催化剂上的脱活表面物种与Fe-ZSM-5上的不同，可能由表面氧覆盖度解释。FAPO和Fe-TUD-1上的高氧覆盖度导致表面氧的缓慢脱附，从而形成羧酸盐而不是焦炭，这是Fe-ZSM-5上常见的脱活物种。

5. 通过原位红外光谱测量，可以观察到催化剂表面在反应过程中的稳定基线，以及相对较少的焦炭生成，这表明催化剂的稳定性相对较高。这与形成羧酸盐而非焦炭的较慢脱活率和较低的脱活率一致。

6. FAPO和Fe-TUD-1催化剂显示出较低的焦炭生成和相对较小的脱活现象，这有助于它们在流体中的稳定性。这可能是由于催化剂表面上较高的氧覆盖度导致形成羧酸盐而非焦炭。

1. Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites can influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield vary under different reaction conditions. The key performance metrics demonstrate effectiveness depending on the specific synthesis method employed.

2. Steam treatment reduces the performance of the AlPO4-5 based catalyst, as it negatively impacts its activity and selectivity in the N2O-induced propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

3. Iron-TUD-1 and iron-alumina-TUD-1 catalysts exhibit lower activity and selectivity compared to the AlPO4-5 (FAPO) based catalysts. This is attributed to the presence of a substantial amount of iron clusters and oxides in these catalysts.

4. The stability of the investigated catalysts is significantly better than that reported for iron zeolites. This is explained by the differences in surface chemistry, as operando DRIFT studies reveal the formation of carbonates and carboxylates on the surfaces of the FAPO and TUD-1 based catalysts, rather than coke.

5. The reason for the lower activity of the steamed AlPO4-5 (FAPOste) and iron-TUD-1 and iron-alumina-TUD-1 catalysts, compared to steam-activated iron zeolites, is discussed based on a mechanistic evaluation. This involves a detailed examination of the reaction pathways and the nature of the active sites.

6. The reaction between N2O, N2, and α-oxygen (step 1) produces α-oxygen and N2, which subsequently react with propane (step 3) to form propene. Step 3 is much faster than the recombination and desorption of α-oxygen (step 2), which explains the enhancement in N2O conversion due to the presence of propane in the feed.

7. The desorption rate of surface activated oxygen plays a crucial role in determining the deactivation rate and formation of carboxylates, rather than coke, on the surfaces of the catalysts. This is tentatively explained by the relatively low surface oxygen coverage of iron zeolites during the reaction, as illustrated in Scheme 1.

8. Further stability evaluation in the presence of higher propane concentrations and at different propane/N2O ratios is necessary to understand the impact on the rates of reaction steps (5) and (6).

9. Deactivation of iron zeolites, particularly ex-Fe-ZSM-5, leads to a significant drop in propane conversion, but deactivation is reversible, allowing for continuous production of C3H6 in a battery of parallel reactors.

1. 不同的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，可以影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同的反应条件下各不相同，这些指标显示了在特定合成方法下催化剂的有效性。

2. 蒸汽处理降低了AlPO4-5（FAPO）基催化剂的性能，因为它对N2O诱导的丙烷氧化脱氢反应的活性和选择性产生了负面影响。

3. 铁-TUD-1和铁-铝-TUD-1催化剂的活性和选择性比基于AlPO4-5（FAPO）的催化剂低。这归因于这些催化剂中存在大量铁簇和氧化物。

4. 调查的催化剂的稳定性明显优于报告的铁沸石。这通过表面化学差异得到解释，因为原位DRIFT研究表明，FAPO和TUD-1基催化剂表面上形成了碳酸盐和羧酸盐，而不是焦炭。

5. 基于机理评估，解释了蒸馏后的AlPO4-5（FAPOste）和铁-TUD-1和铁-铝-TUD-1催化剂的活性较低的原因，与蒸汽活化的铁沸石相比。这涉及详细分析反应途径和活性位点的性质。

6. N2O、N2和α氧（步骤1）的反应产生α氧和N2，随后与丙烷（步骤3）反应生成丙烯。步骤3比重组和释放α氧（步骤2）快得多，这是由于丙烷在进料中的存在而增强的N2O转化率的原因。

7. 表面激活氧的脱附速率决定了催化剂表面的脱活速率和形成羧酸盐而不是焦炭的速率。这由反应步骤（5）和（6）的影响来解释，表面氧覆盖相对较低是铁沸石在反应过程中的一种假设。

8. 需要进一步在高丙烷浓度和不同丙烷/N2O比例下的稳定性评估，以理解对反应步骤（5）和（6）的影响。

9. 特别是对于ex-Fe-ZSM-5，脱活导致丙烷转化率显著下降，但脱活是可逆的，允许在并联反应器电池中连续生产C3H6。
