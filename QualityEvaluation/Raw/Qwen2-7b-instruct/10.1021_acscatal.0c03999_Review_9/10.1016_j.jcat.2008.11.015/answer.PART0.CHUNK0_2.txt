    How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

[1] "Compared to literature data on optimized Fe-ZSM-5, FAPOcal shows relatively low activity and comparable selectivities in N2O induced propane selective oxidation."
[2] "Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1 are less active and selective than FAPOcal."
[3] "The stability of the investigated systems is significantly better than reported for Fe- ZSM-5."
[4] "operando DRIFT studies show formation of carbonates and carboxylates on the surfaces of the FAPO and TUD-1 based catalysts, rather than coke."
[5] "The performance remains lower than reported for optimised Fe-ZSM-5."
[6] "While the performance remains lower than reported for optimised Fe-ZSM-5, it should be mentioned that the stability of the TUD-1 and FAPO based catalysts is quite good."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Specifically, iron-substituted AlPO4-5 (FAPOcal) and iron-promoted TUD-1 (Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1) showed less activity and selectivity than optimized Fe-ZSM-5 in the ODHP reaction. The stability of these systems, however, was better than Fe-ZSM-5. The key performance metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrated their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Operando DRIFT studies revealed that the surfaces of FAPO and TUD-1-based catalysts formed carbonates and carboxylates, contributing to their stability rather than coke formation, which is typical in Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts. The stability of the TUD-1 and FAPO systems was noted to be quite good despite their lower activity compared to optimized Fe-ZSM-5.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法（包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换）影响其在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。具体而言，铁替代的AlPO4-5（FAPOcal）和铁促进的TUD-1（Fe-TUD-1和Fe-Al-TUD-1）在ODHP反应中相对于优化的Fe-ZSM-5活性和选择性较低。然而，这些系统的稳定性优于Fe-ZSM-5。关键性能指标，包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同的反应条件下证明了它们的有效性。原位DRIFT研究揭示了FAPO和TUD-1基催化剂表面形成了碳酸盐和羧酸盐，这有助于它们的稳定性而不是Fe-ZSM-5催化剂中常见的焦炭形成。TUD-1和FAPO系统在活性低于优化的Fe-ZSM-5的情况下表现出良好的稳定性。
