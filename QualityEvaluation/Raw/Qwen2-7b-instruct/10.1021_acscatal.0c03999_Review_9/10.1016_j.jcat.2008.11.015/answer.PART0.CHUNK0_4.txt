[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with dioxygen to produce propene has been intensively studied in the literature [13]."
[2] "Unfortunately, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propylene yield [6]."
[3] "Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1 are less active and selective than FAPOcal."
[4] "However, the stability of the investigated systems is significantly better than reported for Fe- ZSM-5."
[5] "Operando DRIFT studies show formation of carbonates and carboxylates on the surfaces of the FAPO and TUD-1 based catalysts, rather than coke."
[6] "The reason for the lower activity of 2FAPOste and the 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 catalysts, as compared to steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, will be further discussed in the following paragraph, on the basis of a mechanistic evaluation."
[7] "The following elemental steps are proposed to be involved in the reaction: N2O + N2 + α-O,(1) 2α-OO2 + 2,(2) C3H8 + α-OC3H6+ H2O,(3)"
[8] "Obviously the reaction between α-oxygen and propane, step (3),is much faster than the recombination and desorption of α-oxygen,step (2)."
[9] "Two neighboring sites are needed for O2 desorption, while reaction step (3) principally only requires one, isolated, site."
[10] "Based on the relatively stable baseline in the DRIFT measurements, we assume the amount of coke formed to be relatively small."
[11] "Although the applied propane concentration in our studies was relatively low, and that further stability evaluation in the presence of higher propane concentrations, and at different propane/N2O ratio should be performed, which might affect the rates of reaction steps (5) and (6)."
[12] "While coke is relatively easily formed on ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and leads to a drop in propane conversion from 48% to 10% after 7 h on stream [4,31], it should be mentioned that deactivation is reversible, and in practice C3H6 can be produced continuously in a battery of parallel reactors [32]."

1. Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites can influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield vary under different reaction conditions. The key performance metrics demonstrate effectiveness depending on the specific synthesis method employed.

2. Steam treatment reduces the performance of the AlPO4-5 based catalyst, as it negatively impacts its activity and selectivity in the N2O-induced propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.

3. Iron-TUD-1 and iron-alumina-TUD-1 catalysts exhibit lower activity and selectivity compared to the AlPO4-5 (FAPO) based catalysts. This is attributed to the presence of a substantial amount of iron clusters and oxides in these catalysts.

4. The stability of the investigated catalysts is significantly better than that reported for iron zeolites. This is explained by the differences in surface chemistry, as operando DRIFT studies reveal the formation of carbonates and carboxylates on the surfaces of the FAPO and TUD-1 based catalysts, rather than coke.

5. The reason for the lower activity of the steamed AlPO4-5 (FAPOste) and iron-TUD-1 and iron-alumina-TUD-1 catalysts, compared to steam-activated iron zeolites, is discussed based on a mechanistic evaluation. This involves a detailed examination of the reaction pathways and the nature of the active sites.

6. The reaction between N2O, N2, and α-oxygen (step 1) produces α-oxygen and N2, which subsequently react with propane (step 3) to form propene. Step 3 is much faster than the recombination and desorption of α-oxygen (step 2), which explains the enhancement in N2O conversion due to the presence of propane in the feed.

7. The desorption rate of surface activated oxygen plays a crucial role in determining the deactivation rate and formation of carboxylates, rather than coke, on the surfaces of the catalysts. This is tentatively explained by the relatively low surface oxygen coverage of iron zeolites during the reaction, as illustrated in Scheme 1.

8. Further stability evaluation in the presence of higher propane concentrations and at different propane/N2O ratios is necessary to understand the impact on the rates of reaction steps (5) and (6).

9. Deactivation of iron zeolites, particularly ex-Fe-ZSM-5, leads to a significant drop in propane conversion, but deactivation is reversible, allowing for continuous production of C3H6 in a battery of parallel reactors.

1. 不同的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，可以影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同的反应条件下各不相同，这些指标显示了在特定合成方法下催化剂的有效性。

2. 蒸汽处理降低了AlPO4-5（FAPO）基催化剂的性能，因为它对N2O诱导的丙烷氧化脱氢反应的活性和选择性产生了负面影响。

3. 铁-TUD-1和铁-铝-TUD-1催化剂的活性和选择性比基于AlPO4-5（FAPO）的催化剂低。这归因于这些催化剂中存在大量铁簇和氧化物。

4. 调查的催化剂的稳定性明显优于报告的铁沸石。这通过表面化学差异得到解释，因为原位DRIFT研究表明，FAPO和TUD-1基催化剂表面上形成了碳酸盐和羧酸盐，而不是焦炭。

5. 基于机理评估，解释了蒸馏后的AlPO4-5（FAPOste）和铁-TUD-1和铁-铝-TUD-1催化剂的活性较低的原因，与蒸汽活化的铁沸石相比。这涉及详细分析反应途径和活性位点的性质。

6. N2O、N2和α氧（步骤1）的反应产生α氧和N2，随后与丙烷（步骤3）反应生成丙烯。步骤3比重组和释放α氧（步骤2）快得多，这是由于丙烷在进料中的存在而增强的N2O转化率的原因。

7. 表面激活氧的脱附速率决定了催化剂表面的脱活速率和形成羧酸盐而不是焦炭的速率。这由反应步骤（5）和（6）的影响来解释，表面氧覆盖相对较低是铁沸石在反应过程中的一种假设。

8. 需要进一步在高丙烷浓度和不同丙烷/N2O比例下的稳定性评估，以理解对反应步骤（5）和（6）的影响。

9. 特别是对于ex-Fe-ZSM-5，脱活导致丙烷转化率显著下降，但脱活是可逆的，允许在并联反应器电池中连续生产C3H6。
