[1] "The most promising zeolitic system reported so far for N2O mediated ODHP is steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, displaying initial propene yields up to 25% [4,5]."

[4] "Although steam treatment creates active (clustered) Fe2+ sites in 2FAPOste, enhancing N2O conversion [9],the local environment of catalytic Fe2+ sites is chemically different (including phosphate interactions) than obtained by steaming of isomorphously substituted Fe-ZSM-5, explaining the relatively low activity of 2FAPOste as compared to steam activated Fe-ZSM-5."
[5] "The discrepancy of C and O mass balance for all catalysts presented in Table 2 is consistent with oxygenate formation and coke deposition."
[6] "Based on the relatively stable baseline in the DRIFT measurements, we assume the amount of coke formed to be relatively small."
[7] "Although the investigated catalysts show low coke formation and relatively little deactivation, the performance still does not compete with Fe-ZSM-5."

1. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 has been reported as the most effective system for N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), achieving up to 25% propene yields.
2. Mesoporous materials like 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1 exhibit lower activity and selectivity compared to microporous FAPO catalysts.
3. The performance of FAPO catalysts, particularly 2FAPOcal, is notably less efficient than that of steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5, despite showing relatively high propene selectivity.
4. Steam treatment in 2FAPOste increases N2O conversion by creating active Fe2+ sites, but the local chemical environment differs from that in isomorphously substituted Fe-ZSM-5, leading to lower activity.
5. The mass balance discrepancy for all catalysts indicates oxygenate formation and coke deposition.
6. The stable baseline in DRIFT measurements suggests a small amount of coke formation on the catalyst surface.
7. Despite low coke formation and minimal deactivation, the performance of the investigated catalysts does not match that of steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5.

1. 到目前为止，蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5是N2O介导的ODHP反应中表现最好的系统，其丙烯产率可达25%。
2. 球状催化剂如2Fe-TUD-1和2Fe-2Al-TUD-1的活性和选择性低于微孔型FAPO催化剂。
3. FAPO催化剂，特别是2FAPOcal的性能远不如蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5，尽管其丙烯选择性相对较高。
4. 在2FAPOste中进行蒸汽处理增加了N2O的转化率，通过产生活性Fe2+位点，但其局部化学环境与等晶格取代的Fe-ZSM-5不同，导致活性较低。
5. 所有催化剂的质平衡差异表明氧物种的形成和焦炭沉积。
6. DRIFT测量稳定的基线表明焦炭形成的量相对较小。
7. 尽管焦炭形成较少且活性损失较小，但研究的催化剂的性能仍无法与蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5相匹敌。
