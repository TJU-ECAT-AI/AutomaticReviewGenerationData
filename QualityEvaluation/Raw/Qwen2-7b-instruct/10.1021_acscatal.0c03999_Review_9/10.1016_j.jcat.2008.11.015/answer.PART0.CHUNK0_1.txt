[1] "Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with dioxygen to produce propene has been intensively studied in the literature [13]."
[2] "Unfortunately, a major drawback of iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is deactivation by coke, causing a rapid decrease of the propylene yield [6]."
[3] "Fe-TUD-1 and Fe-Al-TUD-1 are less active and selective than FAPOcal."
[4] "However, the stability of the investigated systems is significantly better than reported for Fe- ZSM-5."
[5] "The performance remains lower than reported for optimized Fe-ZSM-5 [5],comparing the TOF values reported in [5]."
[6] "It is clear from Table 2 that the C and O mass balance of the analyses of the catalysts are not closed to 100%. Besides being related to experimental errors, this suggests that oxygenates might be accumulating on the surface of the catalysts, as will be demonstrated by the investigation of the nature and extent of deposits formed on the catalyst surface during the reaction by DRIFT spectroscopy."
[7] "Certainly features in the 1200 to 1800 cm1 region of the spectra indicate the formation of strongly bound surface adsorbed species (see Fig. 5)."
[8] "In the experiment conducted with 2FAPOste, the IR bands are located at similar positions (not shown for brevity) as observed for 2FAPOcal, besides the presence of an additional band, located at 3735 cm1."
[9] "In Fig. 6, the development of the IR bands upon N2O induced propane oxidation as a function of time is shown for the 2Fe- TUD-1 sample."
[10] "In view of the previously reported very low activity over FAPO in direct N2O decomposition, this step is considered to be hardly possible over calcined FAPO, tentatively explained by the nature of Fe3+ sites and the vicinity of phosphate groups, which might inhibit the oxygen desorption and the regeneration of the iron sites [9]."

1. Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

2. Steam treatment improves the N2O decomposition rate of FAPO in the N2O-mediated propane ODH, enhancing its activity. However, steaming does not significantly improve the performance of FAPO compared to Fe-ZSM-5.

3. FAPO and Fe-TUD-1 catalysts exhibit lower activity and selectivity compared to mesoporous 2Fe-TUD-1 and 2Fe-2Al-TUD-1. This is attributed to the presence of a considerable amount of iron clusters and oxides in the latter, suggesting that the pore structure plays a less critical role than the chemical nature of iron sites in selective N2O-induced propane oxidation.

4. The nature of deactivating surface species differs between FAPO and Fe-TUD-1 catalysts and Fe-ZSM-5, possibly explained by the surface oxygen coverage, which is higher for FAPO and Fe-TUD-1, and relatively lower for Fe-ZSM-5. This results in a slower desorption rate of surface oxygen from FAPO and Fe-TUD-1, leading to the formation of carboxylates rather than coke, which is a more common deactivating species on Fe-ZSM-5.

5. The stability of the investigated catalysts is relatively high, as indicated by the stable baseline in DRIFT measurements and the relatively low amount of coke formed. This is consistent with the small deactivation rate and formation of carboxylates, rather than coke.

6. The FAPO and Fe-TUD-1 catalysts show low coke formation and relatively little deactivation compared to Fe-ZSM-5, contributing to their stability on stream. This is attributed to the high oxygen coverage on the catalyst surfaces, which favors the formation of carboxylates over coke.

1. 不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，会影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化性能。这些催化剂的有效性通过丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率等关键性能指标来衡量。

2. 蒸汽处理可以提高FAPO在N2O介导的丙烷ODHP中的活性，改善N2O分解速率。然而，与Fe-ZSM-5相比，FAPO的性能并未显著提升。

3. FAPO和Fe-TUD-1催化剂的活性和选择性低于具有较大铁簇和氧化物的2Fe-TUD-1和2Fe-2Al-TUD-1催化剂。这可能归因于2Fe-TUD-1和2Fe-2Al-TUD-1中大量存在的铁簇，表明孔结构在选择性N2O诱导丙烷氧化中的作用不如铁位点的化学性质重要。

4. FAPO和Fe-TUD-1催化剂上的脱活表面物种与Fe-ZSM-5上的不同，可能由表面氧覆盖度解释。FAPO和Fe-TUD-1上的高氧覆盖度导致表面氧的缓慢脱附，从而形成羧酸盐而不是焦炭，这是Fe-ZSM-5上常见的脱活物种。

5. 通过原位红外光谱测量，可以观察到催化剂表面在反应过程中的稳定基线，以及相对较少的焦炭生成，这表明催化剂的稳定性相对较高。这与形成羧酸盐而非焦炭的较慢脱活率和较低的脱活率一致。

6. FAPO和Fe-TUD-1催化剂显示出较低的焦炭生成和相对较小的脱活现象，这有助于它们在流体中的稳定性。这可能是由于催化剂表面上较高的氧覆盖度导致形成羧酸盐而非焦炭。
