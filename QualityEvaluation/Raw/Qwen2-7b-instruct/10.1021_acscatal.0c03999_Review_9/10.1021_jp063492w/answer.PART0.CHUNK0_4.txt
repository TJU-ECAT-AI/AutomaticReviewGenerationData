[1] "Steam-activated Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5, which are active catalysts for direct N2O decomposition at ambient pressure,16,21 decompose N2O under vacuum conditions, too."
[2] "The transient responses of O2 and N2 obtained upon N2O pulsing over Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 are shown in Figure 2. They were height-normalized for a better comparison of the shapes (broadness of transient response) and the order of appearance of products."
[3] "As elaborated in the Introduction, this aspect has been extensively debated in the literature.12,14,17,21,23 To this end, the transient responses of N2O, N2, and O2 derived from pulse experiments in the TAP reactor were simultaneously fitted to different kinetic models in Table 1."
[4] "For both catalysts studied, the recombination of two monoatomic oxygen species (*-O) yielding directly gas-phase O2 (model 1) or resulting in the formation of a surface biatomic adsorbed precursor of gas-phase O2 (model 3) can be excluded as the reaction pathways of O2 formation in N2O decomposition."
[5] "Taking into account the activation energies of reaction pathways 3 and 4 in Table 2, it is concluded that oxygen formation occurs easier over FeZSM-5 (50142 kJ mol-1) than over Fesilicalite (125300 kJ mol-1)."
[6] "On the basis of the experimental data and the results of kinetic fitting, oxygen formation can be considered as the rate-limiting step in N2O decomposition under the experimental conditions in this study."
[7] "The final part of this manuscript aims at examining the applicability of our transient kinetic model to predict the previously reported steady-state performance of Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition.21 To this end, we calculated the TOF of N2 formation under steady-state conditions using an N2O partial pressure of 15 × 103 Pa in the temperature range 723823 K."
[8] "Our kinetic model was not able to accurately reproduce the temperature dependence of the TOF values. The measured apparent activation energies of nitrogen formation over Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 were 226 and 190 kJ mol-1, respectively, while the corresponding predicted values are 145 and 92 kJ mol-1."
[9] "However, it predicts lower apparent activation of N2O formation over FeZSM-5 as compared to Fesilicalite in agreement with ref 21."
[10] "The above discussions clearly demonstrated the predictive potential of transient kinetic analysis in the TAP reactor. The kinetics of N2O decomposition derived from low-pressure studies can be extrapolated to higher pressures within the limits of the low coverage conditions."

1. The synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The study did not directly discuss these specific performance metrics, but it implied that the different iron species and their speciation in the zeolites could influence these metrics.

2. The study did not provide a direct comparison of different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. However, it highlighted that the different iron speciation in Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5, which were synthesized through different methods, affected their catalytic performance in the N2O decomposition process.

3. The transient kinetic analysis in the TAP reactor allowed for the prediction of the differences in steady-state performance of Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 catalysts possessing different iron species in the direct N2O decomposition over a wide range of temperatures and N2O partial pressures. This predictive potential demonstrates the applicability of transient kinetic analysis in understanding and predicting the catalytic performance of iron-containing zeolites under various conditions.

1. 铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，会影响其在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。表现这些有效性的指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。研究没有直接讨论这些具体性能指标，但暗示了在不同铁物种及其在沸石中的物种在该过程中的影响。

2. 研究没有提供不同合成方法的铁基ZSM-5沸石的直接比较。但是，它强调了Fesilicalite和FeZSM-5中不同铁物种的差异，这两种沸石通过不同的方法合成，在N2O分解过程中影响其催化性能。

3. 在TAP反应器中的瞬态动力学分析允许预测Fesilicalite和FeZSM-5催化剂在不同温度和N2O分压下的直接N2O分解过程中的相对稳态性能，具有不同铁物种。这种预测潜力表明瞬态动力学分析在理解并预测铁基沸石在各种条件下的催化性能方面的适用性。
