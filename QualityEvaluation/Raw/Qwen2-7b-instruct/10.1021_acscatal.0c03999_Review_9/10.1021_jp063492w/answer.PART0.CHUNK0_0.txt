[1] "Steam-activated Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5, which are active catalysts for direct N2O decomposition at ambient pressure,16,21 decompose N2O under vacuum conditions, too."
[2] "Despite this fact, the direct N2O decomposition behavior of the catalysts above 723 K differs substantially, where both N2 and O2 were observed as reaction products."
[3] "Upon increase of the reaction temperature from 773 to 848 K, the tmax of O2 over Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 decreased from 0.28 to 0.11 s and from 0.67 to 0.14 s, respectively."
[4] "As shown in Figure 3, the smallest deviations between the experimental and predicted transient responses of N2O, N2, and O2 were obtained with model 5."
[5] "The optimized kinetic parameters of direct N2O decomposition resulting from model 5 over Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 are compared in Table 2."
[6] "Taking into account the activation energies of reaction pathways 3 and 4 in Table 2, it is concluded that oxygen formation occurs easier over FeZSM-5 (50142 kJ mol-1) than over Fesilicalite (125300 kJ mol-1)."
[7] "On the basis of the experimental data and the results of kinetic fitting, oxygen formation can be considered as the rate-limiting step in N2O decomposition under the experimental conditions in this study."
[8] "The TAP-derived kinetic model can be used to predict the relative steady-state catalytic performance in direct N2O decomposition in a wide range of temperatures and N2O partial pressures."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. These metrics are crucial indicators of the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts in the ODHP process.

The steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange methods alter the structure and properties of the zeolites, which in turn affects their activity and stability in the ODHP reaction. Steam treatment enhances the dispersion of iron species, promoting better access to the active sites and potentially increasing the reaction rates. Solid-state ion exchange can modify the acidity of the zeolite framework, influencing the selectivity towards desired products. Liquid exchange might alter the hydration state of the zeolite, affecting the solvation dynamics of reactants and products.

The specific effects on C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield depend on the details of the synthesis method used. For instance, steam treatment might lead to a higher C3H8 conversion and N2O conversion due to improved dispersion of iron species, while solid-state ion exchange could enhance the C3H6 selectivity by tuning the zeolite acidity. Liquid exchange might affect the solvation of reactants and products, impacting the reaction pathways and yields.

Overall, the choice of synthesis method can significantly impact the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction, affecting the efficiency of N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Optimizing the synthesis conditions to achieve the best balance among C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield is crucial for enhancing the performance of these catalysts in the process.

The kinetic model derived from the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor can predict the relative steady-state catalytic performance of Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 catalysts possessing different iron species in direct N2O decomposition. The model can be extrapolated to higher pressures within the limits of the low coverage conditions, correctly predicting the differences in steady-state performance across a wide range of temperatures and N2O partial pressures. The model provides insights into the mechanism of N2 and O2 formation, confirming that the reaction pathways leading to O2 are rate-limiting. This knowledge allows for a better understanding of the catalytic behavior of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in N2O-assisted processes, facilitating the optimization of their performance.
