The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 

For instance, Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5, which are active catalysts for direct N2O decomposition at ambient pressure, decompose N2O under vacuum conditions. Gas-phase N2 is observed above 523 K, while gas-phase O2 is detected above 623 K. The direct N2O decomposition behavior of the catalysts above 723 K differs substantially, where both N2 and O2 are observed as reaction products. The transient responses of O2 and N2 upon N2O pulsing over Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 are height-normalized for comparison. Model 5 provided the best description of all transient responses across the investigated temperature range. The kinetic parameters for direct N2O decomposition from model 5 over Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 are compared in Table 2. It was concluded that oxygen formation occurs easier over FeZSM-5 than over Fesilicalite. The ratio of ϑ*/ϑ*-O for FeZSM-5 increased with temperature. However, the model was not able to accurately reproduce the temperature dependence of the TOF values.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，会影响其在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中对N2O的催化性能。表现指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，以展示其有效性。

例如，Fesilicalite和FeZSM-5作为直接N2O分解的活性催化剂，在大气压力下具有活性，也能在真空条件下分解N2O。当温度高于523 K时，观察到气相N2；当温度高于623 K时，检测到气相O2。在723 K以上的直接N2O分解行为存在显著差异，此时观察到N2和O2作为反应产物。Fesilicalite和FeZSM-5上N2O脉冲时的O2和N2瞬态响应通过归一化进行比较。模型5提供了整个研究范围内所有瞬态响应的最佳描述。表2中比较了模型5从Fesilicalite和FeZSM-5得到的直接N2O分解的热力学参数。结论是，氧气形成在FeZSM-5中的效率高于Fesilicalite。FeZSM-5上的ρ*/ρ*-O比率随温度增加。然而，模型无法准确再现TOF值的温度依赖性。
