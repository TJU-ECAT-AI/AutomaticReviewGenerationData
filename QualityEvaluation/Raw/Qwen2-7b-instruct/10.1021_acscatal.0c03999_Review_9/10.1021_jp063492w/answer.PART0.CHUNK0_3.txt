[1] "Steam-activated Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5, which are active catalysts for direct N2O decomposition at ambient pressure,16,21 decompose N2O under vacuum conditions, too."
[2] "The transient responses of O2 and N2 obtained upon N2O pulsing over Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 are shown in Figure 2. They were height-normalized for a better comparison of the shapes (broadness of transient response) and the order of appearance of products."
[3] "FeSilicalite. Figure 3 displays the experimental transient responses of N2O, N2, and O2 upon pulsing N2O over Fesilicalite at 798 K and the resulting calculated responses by applying models 16 with optimized kinetic parameters."
[4] "As discussed above, the derived mechanism of N2O decomposition correctly predicts the transient behavior of N2O decomposition over samples containing different iron species."
[5] "The final part of this manuscript aims at examining the applicability of our transient kinetic model to predict the previously reported steady-state performance of Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition.21"

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics demonstrating their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The document discusses how these catalysts perform under different reaction conditions, highlighting the importance of these metrics in evaluating their effectiveness. The kinetic model derived from transient studies allows predicting the steady-state catalytic performance across a wide range of temperatures and N2O partial pressures, effectively comparing the relative activities of Fesilicalite and FeZSM-5 catalysts.
