1. Various synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by affecting the distribution and structure of iron species within the zeolite. These methods lead to different iron constitutions and speciation, which in turn impact the reaction pathways and efficiency of N2O decomposition.

2. Key performance metrics for evaluating the effectiveness of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the ODHP reaction include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. These metrics indicate the extent of propane conversion, N2O utilization, and the selectivity towards desired C3H6 products.

3. The kinetic models evaluated for describing the transient responses in N2O decomposition reveal that models considering O2 formation via reactions involving adsorbed monoatomic oxygen species fail to accurately represent the experimental data. Models that propose O2 formation through the direct reaction of N2O with adsorbed oxygen species provide a better fit to the observed transient responses.

4. The mechanism of N2O decomposition over iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, as derived from kinetic analysis, involves two pathways for N2 formation. The first pathway involves N2O decomposition over free iron sites leading to gas-phase N2 and an iron site with adsorbed monoatomic oxygen. The second pathway involves the active site being catalytically active for N2O decomposition, leading to gas-phase N2 and adsorbed biatomic oxygen species, which isomerizes and decomposes to give gas-phase O2 and a free iron site.

5. The kinetic model that considers N2O decomposition over free iron sites yielding gas-phase N2 and iron site with monoatomic adsorbed oxygen species is selected for its ability to accurately describe the experimental data. This model also includes a subsequent step where the adsorbed biatomic oxygen species isomerizes and decomposes to generate gas-phase O2 and a free iron site.

6. The rate coefficients for the elementary reaction steps involved in N2O decomposition were initially obtained through fitting the kinetic models to the experimental data and were then fixed for further analysis.

7. The TAP-derived kinetic model enables the prediction of the relative catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in direct N2O decomposition across a wide range of temperatures and N2O partial pressures. This model can be used to estimate the steady-state performance of these catalysts in ODHP reactions.
