    "Summary": "Both review articles effectively cover the topic of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts in ODHP reactions, presenting comprehensive analyses and innovative perspectives. However, they do not significantly outperform each other in any aspect, resulting in identical scores. Both articles are equally strong in content quality, methodology assessment, and practical application value, while showing comparable academic standards and critical thinking. Their writing quality and structure and organization are rated similarly, indicating a comparable level of clarity and coherence. The slight difference in scores lies in the slightly higher scores given to Review A in terms of innovation and contribution, particularly in proposing new research directions, and the slightly higher score given to Review B in terms of clarity of research method description. Neither review stands out as superior in the overall evaluation."
