Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2004.02.013\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2014.07.032\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005\].

        The synthesis of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly through wet ion-exchange (WIE), chemical vapor deposition/sublimation, and ex-framework methods, profoundly impacts their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). For instance, Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized using ferrocene as the iron precursor demonstrates superior performance in ODHP with N2O, achieving a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1 after severe calcination. The identification of FeOAl species as active sites enables the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. The accumulation of organic species, primarily alkylbenzenes, during the reaction further enhances this process.

        Moreover, the nature and location of these active extraframework iron species play a critical role in the deactivation behavior of the catalyst. The presence of extraframework iron species generated during steam treatment is indispensable for producing active catalysts. Interestingly, steam-activated Fe-zeolites like FeZSM-5 show remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with other materials like FeBEA, which experience rapid and complete deactivation.

        The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is significantly higher than those of commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, which contain 30-40 times less iron. Despite this difference, their residual activities after 400 minutes of operation remain quite similar. The mesopores present in ex-FeZSM-5 due to dealumination during steam treatment contribute to its superior performance compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, where coke formation physically blocks the active reaction sites within the zeolitic pore system, leading to a decreased C3H6 yield.

        Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which can be achieved with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is not essential for obtaining high activity in N2O decomposition. WIE yields a catalyst where less than 50% of the exchange sites are occupied by Fe, demonstrating that achieving high activity does not necessarily require saturation of the exchange sites.

        Remarkably, Fe-ZSM-5 maintains a stable propane conversion rate of approximately 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for more than 40 hours when the N2O/C3H8 ratio is 1:2. The direct N2O decomposition activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite, highlighting its versatility and efficiency in N2O-assisted reactions.

The influence of various synthesis methods, such as wet ion-exchange (WIE), chemical vapor deposition/sublimation, and ex-framework method, on the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction has been extensively explored. Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites prepared via solid-state exchange, particularly those using ferrocene as the iron precursor, have demonstrated superior performance for ODHP with N2O. Severe calcination has led to the identification of FeOAl species as the active sites, enabling the formation of stable mono-oxygen species through chemisorption of nitrous oxide, which then react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. Organic species, primarily alkylbenzenes, have accumulated during the reaction process. Remarkably, these catalysts maintain a stable propane conversion rate and propylene production rate for extended periods under specific reaction conditions, showcasing their robustness and efficiency.

        The pH of the iron salt and zeolite suspension during WIE plays a critical role in achieving high activity in N2O decomposition. The topology of the zeolite also significantly influences both the activity and stability of the catalyst under practical conditions.

Key performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield highlight the effectiveness of these catalysts under diverse reaction conditions. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, especially FeZSM-5, are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-cat. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is indispensable for producing active catalysts. FeZSM-5 exhibits remarkable resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA undergoes rapid and complete deactivation. The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is significantly higher than that of commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, which have 30-40 times lower iron content.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1016/j.apcatb.2004.02.013]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1016/j.micromeso.2014.07.032] and [10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005]. The effectiveness and performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions: Impact of synthesis methods on catalytic performance and evaluation through key performance metrics. The WIE method, particularly using iron sulfate and Mohrs salt, is favored for its high catalytic activity and ease of catalyst manufacture. The pH of the iron salt and zeolite suspension during WIE plays a crucial role in achieving high activity in N2O decomposition. The topology of the zeolite is also a significant factor affecting both the activity and stability of the catalyst under realistic practical conditions. Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which can be achieved with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, is not essential for obtaining high activity in N2O decomposition. Additionally, WIE yields a catalyst where less than 50% of the exchange sites are occupied by Fe. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, exhibits superior performance for ODHP with N2O. After severe calcination, Fe-ZSM-5 shows a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1. Active sites identified as FeOAl species enable the formation of stable mono-oxygen species through chemisorption of nitrous oxide, which then react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. Organic species, mainly alkylbenzenes, accumulate during the reaction. Remarkably, Fe-ZSM-5 maintains a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for over 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5, are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-cat. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. FeZSM-5 shows remarkable resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA experiences rapid and complete deactivation. The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than from commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, which have 30-40 times lower iron content. However, their residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. Mesopores are present in ex-FeZSM-5 due to dealumination during steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite. Coke formation physically blocks the active reaction sites within the zeolitic pore system, leading to a decreased C3H6 yield. The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species play a crucial role in the deactivation behavior. Additionally, ex-FeZSM-5 shows significantly higher activity in direct N2O decomposition compared to ex-Fe-silicalite.
