Future research endeavors might focus on refining synthesis techniques to maximize catalyst activity and stability, particularly in the context of direct N2O decomposition. The role of iron speciation and its spatial arrangement within the zeolite framework, as well as the impact of surface chemistry and porosity on reaction kinetics and product selectivity, should be thoroughly investigated. Moreover, the development of integrated systems that optimize reactor design for enhanced mass transfer and heat management could significantly improve the overall efficiency of the ODHP process. Additionally, the potential for recycling and regeneration strategies to extend catalyst life and reduce environmental impact represents a promising avenue for sustainable catalysis.

            The insights from these studies highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between synthesis parameters, catalyst properties, and reaction kinetics in the context of ODHP. By leveraging advances in materials science and catalysis, it becomes possible to engineer more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for the production of valuable hydrocarbons from renewable resources, such as propane derived from biomass or natural gas. The ability to tailor catalyst performance through precise control of synthesis conditions holds the key to unlocking new applications in petrochemical processing, energy conversion, and the valorization of waste gases.

            In summary, the comprehensive review presented here not only synthesizes existing knowledge on the use of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts in ODHP reactions but also paves the way for future research that aims to push the boundaries of catalytic performance and process efficiency. The challenges and opportunities outlined in this document underscore the need for interdisciplinary collaboration among chemists, materials scientists, and engineers to address the complex issues inherent in developing advanced catalytic systems for industrial-scale applications.

4.2. Zeolite-Based Catalysts
4.2.1. Metal-Modified Zeolites
Different metal-containing zeolites, such as MFI (19,35,36,178,180−183,195−199) or BEA, (18,182,200,201) have been widely studied for the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts. (36,182,183,199,202,203) An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 °C. (180−183) Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 °C. (19,35,36,198,199,204)
The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2O&ndash;ODHP. (178,181,182) This pretreatment also enables reduction in surface acidity, resulting in higher C3H6 selectivity. Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3&ndash;TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brønsted acid sites. (205−207) Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity.
On iron containing ZSM-5, studies report that Fe&ndash;O&ndash;Al species are likely active sites for N2O-mediated ODHP. (19,35,36) Grunert et al. have used FT-IR analysis paired with NO adsorption to characterize the abundant Fe species (Figure 18A) and catalytic evaluation of Fe-ZSM-5 (Figure 18) to support such hypothesis. (36) Of note, FT-IR spectroscopy, along with NO adsorption, is commonly used to characterize active sites for Fe-containing catalysts. For samples without calcination (Fe-MFI-24G), NO adsorption results in a broad band at 1850 cm&ndash;1, indicating mononitrosyl on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5. When samples are calcined at high temperatures, two strong bands at 1875 and 1890 cm&ndash;1 are observed in the IR spectra. The band at 1875 cm&ndash;1 corresponds to the mononitrosyl species on extra-framework Fe2+&ndash;O&ndash;Al sites; the other band at 1890 cm&ndash;1 is assigned to the mononitrosyl species on isolated ferrous ions located on γ sites of the ZSM-5 structure. The band observed at 1810 cm&ndash;1 is assigned to poly nitrosyl species on ferrous ion sites. As initial adsorption of NO on Fe-MFI-1173 results in the emergence of a band at 1875 cm&ndash;1, it is hypothesized that both bands at 1810 and 1875 cm&ndash;1 come from the same ferrous species, namely isolated extra-framework Fe2+&ndash;O&ndash;Al species. Clearly, calcining Fe-MFI-24G samples leads to the transformation of iron sites from isolated ions to isolated extra-framework Fe&ndash;O&ndash;Al species. Figure 18B shows the C3H6 yield during N2O-mediated ODHP for samples calcined at different temperatures. An increase in C3H6 yield is observed as the calcination temperature rises from 600 °C (Fe-MFI-24G-873) to 800 °C (Fe-MFI-24G-1073), while the samples calcined at 800 (Fe-MFI-24G-1073) and 900 °C (Fe-MFI-24G-1173) show similar highest C3H6 yields between 27% and 30%. On the basis of this correlation between exposed active iron sites and the observed catalytic performance, it is proposed that the isolated Fe&ndash;O&ndash;Al site is the active center responsible for N2O-mediated ODHP reaction. (19,35,36)


Further analyses with in situ DRIFTS and TPD reveal that reoxidation of the Fe2+&ndash;O&ndash;Al site with N2O forms an O&ndash; species, which is thermally stable and highly selective in the target reaction. (19,35,36) On the basis of such observations, the following mechanism is proposed:
(4-3)
(4-4)
(4-5)
(4-6)
(4-7)
(4-8)
In the proposed mechanism, the Fe3+&ndash;Fe2+ cycle operates on the highly isolated extra-framework Fe&ndash;O&ndash;Al site to decompose N2O to N2 and O2 (eq 4-3-eq 4-6) and forms Fe3+&ndash;O&ndash; species. (208−210) Since the direct reaction of C3H8 and gaseous O2 produces COx as the main products, it is hypothesized that C3H8 reacts with the deposited O&ndash; species to produce C3H6 with a high selectivity (eq 4-7). The C3H6 may further react with adsorbed O&ndash; to form undesired COx species, as depicted in eq 4-8.
Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. (180−183) A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with GC analysis (Figure 19) performed on MFI, BEA, and silicate catalysts is used to illustrate how zeolite catalysts deactivates over time during ODHP reaction. (182) Of note, c- indicates calcined only, and ex- indicates steam-activated samples after calcination; As presented in Figure 19, most catalysts show their highest C3H6 yields within the first few minutes on stream, and then deactivate rapidly within the first 20 min on stream. An excellent correlation between the increase in coke formation and decrease in C3H6 yield is observed, and based on such correlation it is hypothesized that coke formation is responsible for deactivation of the catalysts during the reaction. (182,183) Among the different zeolites tested, steam activated Fe-ZSM-5, with abundant extra-framework iron sites, presents the highest resistance to deactivation, and shows a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream. Even after 400 min on stream, it is able to maintain a C3H6 yield of 8%, unlike other catalysts that deactivate almost completely. It is hypothesized that this elevated performance likely originates from the absence of large cages in ZSM-5. Since the size of the channel and intersections are similar, coke precursors are not trapped in intersections and are hypothesized to more effectively diffuse out. On the other hand, BEA zeolites have large cavities with relatively small apertures in the framework. Such cavities may trap bulky organics, completely blocking the access to active sites and causing rapid deactivation. While the amount of coke formation and the C3H6 yield usually display a nice correlation, for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5, this is not the case. While the coke content is 4 to 5 times higher for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 than ex-H-ZSM-5, similar C3H6 yields are obtained after 400 min on stream. On the basis of this observation, Gallardo-Llamas and co-workers hypothesize that the location of the coke is another important factor that affects the deactivation process. (182,183) Such a hypothesis is also supported by the work of Pérez-Ramírez et al., in which gallium-containing MFI zeolites exhibit higher coke formation than the corresponding aluminum-containing zeolite, yet still show a higher C3H6 yield after 120 min on stream for the ODHP reaction. (196) While such deactivated zeolite catalysts can be regenerated by treatment with air at elevated temperatures, it is reported that regenerated catalysts tend to deactivate much faster than the fresh ones, showing a sharp decrease in catalytic activity within a few minutes on stream. (180,183,196) Better understanding of catalyst deactivation and improvement of catalyst stability still remain as challenge for efficient utilization of N2O for ODHP reactions.

There have only been a few reports where other metal-containing MFI catalysts such as cobalt or manganese have been tested for N2O&ndash;ODHP. (198,211) While it is reported that both cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2O&ndash;ODHP than iron-containing ZSM-5, there are insufficient data to definitively draw assertion. Furthermore, stability or deactivation studies using N2O&ndash;ODHP on such catalysts are still very scarce, thereby making it difficult to evaluate their potential for this reaction at this stage.
4.2.2. Effect of Zeolite Topology
There have been reports deploying other zeolite frameworks for the N2O&ndash;ODHP reaction as well, including MOR, FAU, and BEA. (18,36,182,200,201,204,212) However, the catalytic performance of most of these frameworks is inferior to the MFI zeolites, not only possessing lower C3H6 yield but also fast deactivation. FAU and BEA zeolites are the frameworks that show relatively better performance and are close to the MFI-based catalysts, with their highest C3H6 yields between 7% and 17%. (36,204) However, the BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. (182,200) Sobalik and co-workers find that C3H6 yield decreases to 25% of its initial yield for iron-containing BEA within 2 h on stream. (201) Pérez-Ramírez et al. also report that a lab-synthesized Fe-BEA deactivates rapidly, showing a decrease by 90% of its initial yield within the first hour of reaction. (182) MOR or FER frameworks are much less active in the N2O&ndash;ODHP reaction, exhibiting very low C3H6 yields (i.e., <2%). (36,204) A summary of the catalytic performance of different zeolite catalysts is shown in Table 12. While Fe-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied for this reaction because of its superior performance, studies of other frameworks are still limited. More efforts are needed to explore the effect of other framework topologies on catalytic performance.
