Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites are prominently utilized as catalysts in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions, owing to their unique structural and electronic properties that facilitate the activation and transfer of oxygen atoms to propane molecules for the formation of valuable products such as propylene. The effectiveness and performance of these catalysts are significantly influenced by the synthesis methods employed, which can alter their surface chemistry, pore architecture, and redox properties, thereby impacting their activity and selectivity in the ODHP process. Key performance metrics, including conversion efficiency, product selectivity, and stability over time, serve as critical indicators of the catalyst's overall effectiveness. Researchers often compare catalysts synthesized through different methods, such as sol-gel, hydrothermal, or microwave-assisted routes, to determine which conditions yield the most optimal catalysts for the ODHP reaction. These studies not only aim to enhance the yield of desired products but also to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact, making the development of efficient iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts an active area of research in the field of green chemistry and catalysis.
