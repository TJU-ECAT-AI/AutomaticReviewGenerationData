          [1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
          [2] "The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts."
          [3] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
          [4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
          [5] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
          [6] "Initial C3H6 yield between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is marginal if their constitution with respect to iron is taken into account."
          [7] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite."
          [8] "Coke formation causes physical blocking of the active reaction sites inside the zeolitic pore system, resulting in a decreased C3H6 yield."
          [9] "The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species may play an essential role on the deactivation behavior too."
          [10] "The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite."

          Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics, such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5, are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-cat. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. FeZSM-5 shows remarkable resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA experiences rapid and complete deactivation. The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than from commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, which have 30-40 times lower iron content. However, their residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. Mesopores are present in ex-FeZSM-5 due to dealumination during steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite. Coke formation physically blocks the active reaction sites within the zeolitic pore system, leading to a decreased C3H6 yield. The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species play a crucial role in the deactivation behavior. Additionally, ex-FeZSM-5 shows significantly higher activity in direct N2O decomposition compared to ex-Fe-silicalite.

          含铁ZSM-5沸石的不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，影响其在N2O辅助氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标，如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同反应条件下证明了它们的有效性。蒸汽活化的铁沸石，尤其是FeZSM-5，在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中是高效且选择性的催化剂，能够在723 K和400,000 ml/h/g-cat的空间速度下达到25%的丙烯产率。在蒸汽处理过程中生成的额外框架铁物种对于生产活性催化剂至关重要。FeZSM-5表现出显著的抗失活能力，而FeBEA经历了迅速且完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率明显高于商业化的H-ZSM-5和H-BEA（铁含量低30-40倍），尽管它们在连续运行400分钟后残留的活性相似。ex-FeZSM-5由于蒸汽处理过程中的去铝化而含有微孔，这是ex-Fe-silicalite中所没有的。焦炭的形成导致了活性反应位点在沸石孔系统内部的物理堵塞，从而降低了C3H6产率。活性额外框架铁物种的性质和位置在失活行为中也起着至关重要的作用。此外，ex-FeZSM-5在直接N2O分解中的活性显著高于ex-Fe-silicalite。
