Iron-zeolite catalysts, particularly Fe-ZSM5, are studied for their application as DeNOx catalysts in lean-burn gasoline and diesel engines, as well as for N2O decomposition and reduction. WIE-prepared Fe-ZSM5 catalysts show relatively high activity in N2O decomposition reactions. The TPR spectra of the Fe(Mohrs)-NH4-ZSM5-SM27 WIE catalyst indicate peaks at approximately 400°C and between 500 and 750°C. Catalysts prepared with Mohrs salt and FeSO4·7H2O exhibit equal activity. The Fe(Mohrs)-NH4-ZSM5-SM27-WIE catalyst with HCl washing and vacuum filtration shows enhanced activity in the propane-assisted SCR of N2O. Fe-ZSM5 catalysts prepared by WIE have higher activity when treated in nitrogen compared to air. Both N2O decomposition and propane-assisted SCR of N2O with Fe(Mohrs)-NH4-ZSM5-SM27-WIE catalysts display similar activity. Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which can be achieved with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, is not a key factor in achieving high activity in N2O decomposition catalysts.
