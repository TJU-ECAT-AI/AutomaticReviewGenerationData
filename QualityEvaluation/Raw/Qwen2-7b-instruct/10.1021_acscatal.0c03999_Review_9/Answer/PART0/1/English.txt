The influence of various synthesis methods, such as wet ion-exchange (WIE), chemical vapor deposition/sublimation, and ex-framework method, on the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction has been studied. The WIE method, particularly using iron sulfate and Mohrs salt, is favored for its high catalytic activity and ease of catalyst manufacture. The pH of the iron salt and zeolite suspension during WIE plays a crucial role in achieving high activity in N2O decomposition. The topology of the zeolite is also a significant factor affecting both the activity and stability of the catalyst under realistic practical conditions. Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which can be achieved with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, is not essential for obtaining high activity in N2O decomposition. Additionally, WIE yields a catalyst where less than 50% of the exchange sites are occupied by Fe.

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, exhibits superior performance for ODHP with N2O. After severe calcination, Fe-ZSM-5 shows a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1. Active sites identified as FeOAl species enable the formation of stable mono-oxygen species through chemisorption of nitrous oxide, which then react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. Organic species, mainly alkylbenzenes, accumulate during the reaction. Remarkably, Fe-ZSM-5 maintains a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for over 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics, such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Steam-activated Fe-zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5, are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP reaction, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-cat. The presence of extraframework iron species, generated during steam treatment, is essential for producing active catalysts. FeZSM-5 shows remarkable resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA experiences rapid and complete deactivation. The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably higher than from commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, which have 30-40 times lower iron content. However, their residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar. Mesopores are present in ex-FeZSM-5 due to dealumination during steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite. Coke formation physically blocks the active reaction sites within the zeolitic pore system, leading to a decreased C3H6 yield. The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species play a crucial role in the deactivation behavior. Additionally, ex-FeZSM-5 shows significantly higher activity in direct N2O decomposition compared to ex-Fe-silicalite.
