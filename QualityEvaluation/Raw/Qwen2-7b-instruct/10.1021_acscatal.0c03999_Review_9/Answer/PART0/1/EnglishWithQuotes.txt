The WIE method, particularly using iron sulfate and Mohrs salt, is favored for its high catalytic activity and ease of catalyst manufacture. The pH of the iron salt and zeolite suspension during WIE plays a crucial role in achieving high activity in N2O decomposition. The topology of the zeolite is also a significant factor affecting both the activity and stability of the catalyst under realistic practical conditions. Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which can be achieved with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, is not essential for obtaining high activity in N2O decomposition.
