[1] "The objective of the present work is to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the effect of high temperature treatment on the catalytic behavior of Fe-ZSM-5."
[2] "Our results show that the autoreduction of the Fe sites, which increases with increasing pre-treatment temperature [10,28,29], can provide a rather trivial explanation for the positive effect of the high temperature treatment, without the need to invoke structural changes in the catalyst."
[3] "The positive effect of steaming and high temperature calcination was first observed for the Fe-ZSM-5 samples prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, which contained Fe in the MFI framework [1,13]."
[4] "The study was carried out on catalysts prepared by chemical vapor deposition of FeCl3 (CVD) or by aqueous ion exchange."
[5] "The effect of steaming and treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 at very high temperatures lead to the creation of localised defects in the ZSM-5 framework."
[6] "These iron sites in the vicinity of defects exhibit a qualitatively different behavior in N2O decomposition."
[7] "In steady state the turn-over-frequency of the aforemen- tioned iron sites is not significantly different from other Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, which did not undergo steaming or high temperature dehydroxylation."

The study investigates the impact of high temperature treatments on the catalytic properties of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly focusing on the role of defects created by steaming and high temperature treatment. The authors found that steaming and high temperature treatments lead to the formation of localized defects in the ZSM-5 framework. These defects cause the iron sites nearby to exhibit distinct behavior in N2O decomposition, resulting in higher activity during the initial stages of the reaction compared to steady-state conditions. However, in steady-state N2O decomposition, the turnover frequency of these iron sites does not significantly differ from those in catalysts that did not undergo steaming or high temperature dehydroxylation. The increase in activity following these treatments can be attributed to an increase in the number of active sites due to the autoreduction of iron centers during the pretreatment process, rather than changes in the intrinsic activity of the sites themselves.

本研究探讨了高温处理对Fe-ZSM-5催化剂催化性能的影响，特别是蒸气处理和高温处理后形成的框架缺陷的作用。研究者发现，蒸气处理和高温处理导致ZSM-5框架中形成局部缺陷。这些缺陷附近的铁位表现出在N2O分解初期与稳态条件下的不同行为，导致更高的活性。然而，在稳态N2O分解过程中，这些铁位的周转频率与未经蒸气处理或高温脱羟基化的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂中的铁位差异不大。这些处理增加活性的原因是铁中心在预处理过程中由于自还原而增加了活性位点的数量，而不是位点本身的内在活性发生变化。
