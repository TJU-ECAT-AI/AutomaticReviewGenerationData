This study examines the impact of different treatments on the catalytic activity of iron-ZSM-5 catalysts in the N2O decomposition process. The treatments include mild dehydroxylation at 873 K in inert gas, severe dehydroxylation at 1200 K, and steaming. The catalysts were prepared using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or aqueous ion exchange. The results indicate that the increase in steady-state activity over steamed and high-temperature treated catalysts can be mainly attributed to an increase in the number of active sites created by the autoreduction of iron centers during steaming and high-temperature treatment.

这项研究探讨了不同处理方法对铁-ZSM-5催化剂在N2O分解过程中的催化活性的影响。处理方法包括873 K下惰性气体中的轻度脱羟基化，1200 K下的重度脱羟基化以及蒸气处理。催化剂通过化学蒸汽沉积（CVD）或水溶液离子交换制备。结果表明，蒸气处理和高温处理催化剂活性增加的主要原因是铁中心在蒸气处理和高温处理过程中通过自身还原产生的活性位点数量增加。

<p>The effect of steaming and high temperature treatment on the transient reaction The step response experiments on the isotopically labeled catalysts give very interesting information about the reactivity of the catalysts as a function of their pretreatment.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Steaming and high temperature treatments lead to the occurrence of transient activity in the catalysts, characterized by a high initial N2O decomposition activity that slowly decays to steady state. The isotope distribution (the evolution of 18f) during the transient activity strongly depends on the pretreatment of the catalyst. Steamed catalysts exhibit two maxima in 18f at the beginning of the transient, attributed to direct association with active iron centers, while dehydroxylated catalysts show a single maximum. The decay of the transient activity is attributed to the rehydroxylation of active sites by traces of H2O in the feed or the transformation of oxygen atoms into less active surface species.

蒸气处理和高温处理导致催化剂中出现暂态反应，特征是高初始N2O分解活性逐渐衰减至稳态。暂态期间的同位素分布（18f的演变）强烈依赖于催化剂的预处理。蒸气处理的催化剂在暂态开始时表现出两个最大值，归因于直接与活性铁中心关联，而脱羟基化催化剂仅表现出单个最大值。暂态活性的衰减归因于喂料中微量水分对活性位点的重新羟基化，或者氧原子转化为活性较低的表面物种。

<p>The effect of steaming and high temperature treatment on the steady-state activity The transient experiments, which we discussed above, show that steaming and high temperature pretreatment qualitatively changes the nature of the active sites. This is probably related to the creation of iron sites next to electron-withdrawing Al Lewis sites, which was created by the creation of framework defects.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Steaming and high temperature treatments alter the nature of the active sites in the catalysts, leading to an increase in the number of active sites due to the autoreduction of iron centers during these processes. This results in a higher initial activity during the transient period, but the steady-state activity does not show significant differences compared to other Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts that did not undergo steaming or high temperature dehydroxylation. The intrinsic activity per site remains relatively unchanged, suggesting that the rate-limiting step of N2O decomposition is not significantly affected by these treatments.

蒸气处理和高温处理改变了催化剂中活性位点的性质，导致由于铁中心在这些过程中自身还原，活性位点数量增加。这在暂态期间导致更高的初始活性，但稳态活性与未经过蒸气处理或高温脱羟基化的其他Fe-ZSM-5催化剂相比没有显著差异。每个位点的内在活性保持相对不变，暗示N2O分解的速率限制步骤没有受到这些处理的显著影响。
