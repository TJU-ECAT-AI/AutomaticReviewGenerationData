The effect of pretreatment on the reactivity of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts for N2O decomposition: Dehydroxylation vs. steaming Pijus K. Roy, Roel Prins, Gerhard D. Pirngruber * Institute of Chemical and Bioengineering, ETH Zurich, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland Received 4 August 2007; received in revised form 29 September 2007; accepted 4 October 2007 Available online 22 October 2007 Abstract The N2O decomposition activity of the Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts, prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and aqueous ion exchange (IE), was studied after steaming and high temperature treatment at 1218 K (HT) and compared with the activity of the corresponding non-steamed catalysts after pretreatment at 873 K.

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics, such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

The increase in steady-state activity over steamed and HT catalysts can be mainly attributed to an increase in the number of active sites created by autoreduction of the iron centers during steaming and high temperature treatment.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The enhanced steady-state activity of steamed and high-temperature treated catalysts is primarily attributed to an increase in the number of active sites resulting from the autoreduction of iron centers during steam treatment and high-temperature processing.

蒸气处理和高温处理催化剂的稳定状态活性增加主要归因于铁中心在蒸气处理和高温加工过程中产生的活性位点数量的增加。

<quotes>
The transient experiments, which we discussed above, show that steaming and high temperature pretreatment qualitatively changes the nature of the active sites. This is probably related to the creation of iron sites next to electron-withdrawing Al Lewis sites, which was created by the creation of framework defects.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
As previously discussed, steaming and high-temperature pretreatments qualitatively alter the nature of the active sites. This is likely due to the formation of iron sites adjacent to electron-withdrawing Al Lewis sites, which are created by the introduction of framework defects.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
正如我们之前讨论的那样，蒸气处理和高温预处理质地区别了活性位点的性质。这很可能与在引入框架缺陷时形成的位于电子吸电子Al路易斯位点附近的铁位点有关。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
The increase of activity following these pretreatments can be explained by an increase in the number of active sites, as a consequence of autoreduction of the iron centers during the pretreatment.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The rise in activity post-pretreatment can be attributed to an augmented number of active sites, resulting from the self-reduction of iron centers during the pretreatment process.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
这些预处理后活性的增加可以解释为铁中心自还原过程中活性位点数量的增加。
</ChineseVersionAnswer>

<quotes>
The question arises whether these sites have an intrinsically higher activity in N2O decomposition. The tentative answer is no. The changes in N2O decomposition activity upon steaming and dehydroxylation can be largely ascribed to their effect on the autoreduction of the iron species.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Whether these sites inherently possess higher N2O decomposition activity remains uncertain. The modifications in N2O decomposition activity following steam treatment and dehydroxylation can predominantly be attributed to their impact on the self-reduction of iron species.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于这些位点是否具有内在更高的N2O分解活性，答案可能是不确定的。蒸汽处理和脱羟基化后N2O分解活性的变化主要归因于它们对铁物种自还原的影响。

Steaming and treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 at very high temperatures lead to the creation of localised defects in the ZSM-5 framework. The electronic properties of the iron sites in the vicinity of these defects change, which is evidenced by the shift of mononitrosyl band to the higher frequencies.

The objective of the present work is to contribute to the ongoing discussion on the effect of high temperature treatment on the catalytic behavior of Fe-ZSM-5. We compare the effect of three different treatments in detail: mild dehydroxylation at 873 K in inert gas, severe dehydroxylation at 1200 K, and steaming.
