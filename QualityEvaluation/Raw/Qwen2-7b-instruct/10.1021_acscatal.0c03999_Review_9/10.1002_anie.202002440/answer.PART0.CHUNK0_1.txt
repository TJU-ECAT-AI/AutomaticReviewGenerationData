[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
[5] "The chemical structure was further characterized with FTIR spectroscopy (Supporting Information, FigureS3) and XPS (Supporting Information, FiguresS4 and S5)."
[6] "This is the first report of direct experimental evidence of methyl radical generation in ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, do not seem to be discussed within this document. The focus is on the reaction mechanisms of propane oxidative dehydrogenation over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts, particularly regarding the existence of gas-phase methyl radicals and the pathways for the formation of propene and other products. The document provides evidence through experimental characterizations, DFT calculations, and kinetic studies that confirm the involvement of both surface-mediated and gas-phase radical pathways in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts. The detailed reaction pathways for the formation of various products, including propene, ethylene, and methyl radicals, are proposed based on these findings.
