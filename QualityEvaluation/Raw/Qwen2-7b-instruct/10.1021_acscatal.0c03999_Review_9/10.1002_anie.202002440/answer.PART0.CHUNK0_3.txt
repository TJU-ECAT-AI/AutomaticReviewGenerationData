[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."
[4] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
[5] "In this regard, synchrotron radiation vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) is an emerging powerful tool for direct online detection of reactive, unstable, and short-lived gas-phase radicals and intermediates for various heterogeneous catalytic reactions."
[6] "We detected traces of nitric oxide (NO) on BN-T-high catalyst during ODHP reaction at 600C by using the SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."

The radical chemistry of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts has been elucidated through the use of online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS). This method provided direct experimental evidence of the existence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts. The results revealed that propene is primarily formed through surface reactions, while C1 and C2 products can be generated via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways. The findings offer new insights into the reaction mechanisms occurring over boron-based catalysts in the ODHP process.

在对六方氮化硼（h-BN）催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢反应的自由基化学进行阐明的过程中，通过在线同步辐射真空紫外线光电离质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）获得了直接实验证据。这种方法揭示了在硼基催化剂上ODHP反应中存在气相甲基自由基（CH3.）。结果表明，丙烯主要通过表面反应产生，而C1和C2产物可以通过表面介导和气体相途径形成。这些发现为理解硼基催化剂上的ODHP过程提供了新的见解。
