[1] "Although hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has recently been identified as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, the reaction mechanisms, especially regarding radical chemistry of this system, remain elusive."
[2] "Now, the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts is achieved by using online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS), which uncovers the existence of gas-phase radical pathways."
[3] "These observations provide new insights towards understanding the ODHP reaction mechanisms over boron-based catalysts."
[4] "Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the results demonstrate that propene is mainly generated on the catalyst surface from the CH activation of propane, while C2 and C1 products can be formed via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways."

The document discusses the use of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). It highlights the first direct experimental evidence of gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3.) in the ODHP reaction over boron-based catalysts, achieved through online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS). The results provide new insights into the reaction mechanisms of ODHP over boron-based catalysts. DFT calculations support the findings, showing that propene is primarily generated on the catalyst surface from the activation of propane, with C2 and C1 products forming via both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways.

本文讨论了六方硼氮化物（h-BN）作为丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应催化剂的应用。它强调了首次通过在线同步辐射真空紫外光离子质谱法（SVUV-PIMS）直接实验证据，证明了硼基催化剂上存在气相甲基自由基（CH3.）。结果为理解硼基催化剂上的ODHP反应机制提供了新的见解。结合密度泛函理论（DFT）计算支持这些发现，表明丙烯主要在催化剂表面由丙烷的激活产生，而C2和C1产物则通过表面介导和气相途径形成。
