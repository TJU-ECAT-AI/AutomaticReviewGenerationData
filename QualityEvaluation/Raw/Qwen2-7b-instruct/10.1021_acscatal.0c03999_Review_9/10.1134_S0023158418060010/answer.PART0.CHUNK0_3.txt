[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with pro- panes and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons. Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption. In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxi- dation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is neces- sary for the dehydrogenation of propane. In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propyl- ene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

In the presence of CO2 during propane dehydrogenation, it acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, and competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface. This inhibits olefin polymerization, decreases propane conversion, and affects the yield of propylene. For gallium catalysts, CO2 significantly hinders propylene formation, possibly due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species. In contrast, for chromium catalysts, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to coke and hydrogen oxidation by CO2 outweighs the negative effects.

在丙烷脱氢过程中，CO2作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，并与烃类竞争吸附于催化剂表面。这阻止了烯烃聚合，降低了丙烷转化率，并影响了丙烯产率。对于镓催化剂系统，CO2显著阻碍了丙烯的形成，可能是因为还原态镓氧化物物种被CO2氧化。相反，对于铬催化剂系统，在引入CO2后，由于焦炭和氢的氧化导致丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高，这些正效应超过了负面影响。
