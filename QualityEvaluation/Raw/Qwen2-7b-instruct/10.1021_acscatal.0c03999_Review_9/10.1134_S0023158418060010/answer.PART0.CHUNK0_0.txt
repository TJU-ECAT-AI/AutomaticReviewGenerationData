[1] "The catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined."
[2] "In the case of the GaOx/SiO2 catalysts, the insufficient dispersity of the active phase is a reason for the low specific activity of these systems."
[3] "In the case of the chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and in the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevailed over a negative effect."
[4] "The use of CO2 as such an additive avoids the occur- rence of deep oxidation reactions that occur when O2 is introduced, and also makes it possible to efficiently utilize this greenhouse gas."
[5] "It is likely that the acid hydroxyls of the support, which are weak acid sites, participate in the formation of the active surface to facilitate the disper- sion of the active phase in the course of catalyst prepa- ration."

1. The study investigated the catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 catalysts supported onto silica gels for propane dehydrogenation, employing various techniques including TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy. The effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation reaction was also evaluated.

2. The low dispersity of the active phase in GaOx/SiO2 catalysts is responsible for their low specific activity.

3. For chromium systems, the introduction of CO2 resulted in an increase in propylene yield and operational stability due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen, outweighing the negative effects.

4. CO2 can be used as an additive to prevent deep oxidation reactions that occur when oxygen is introduced, while also enabling efficient utilization of this greenhouse gas.

5. Weak acid sites, specifically hydroxyls, on the support contribute to the formation of an active surface that facilitates the dispersion of the active phase during catalyst preparation.

1. 研究使用了静止和非静止（响应方法）技术、TPR-H2、TPD-NH3和UV光谱等方法，对硅胶基质上支持的GaOx/SiO2和CrOx/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的催化和物理化学性质进行了研究，并考察了CO2对脱氢过程的影响。

2. GaOx/SiO2催化剂中活性相分散性不足是其低特定活性的原因。

3. 对于铬系统，向系统引入CO2导致丙烯产量增加和操作稳定性提高，这是因为通过氧化焦炭和氢气来实现这一点，从而超过了负面影响。

4. CO2可以作为添加剂，避免发生当氧气引入时发生的深层氧化反应，同时也有利于高效利用这种温室气体。

5. 支撑物上的弱酸性位点，特别是羟基，参与形成活性表面，促进活性相在催化剂制备过程中的分散。
