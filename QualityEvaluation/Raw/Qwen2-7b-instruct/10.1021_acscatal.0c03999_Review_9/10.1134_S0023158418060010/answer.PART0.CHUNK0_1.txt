[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with pro- panes and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[2] "Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption."
[3] "In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield."
[4] "A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[5] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

1. The analysis of relaxations during the dehydrogenation of propane and the displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene revealed that CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, and competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface.

2. By preventing the adsorption of olefins, CO2 reduces their subsequent polymerization and decreases the conversion of propane by inhibiting its adsorption.

3. The introduction of CO2 significantly hinders the formation of propylene in gallium systems, leading to a decrease in its yield.

4. This is possibly due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by CO2, as these species are essential for propane dehydrogenation.

5. In chromium systems, the increase in propylene yield and operational stability, due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon CO2 introduction, outweighs the negative effects.

1. 在丙烷脱氢和二氧化碳与丙烷、丙烯互换分析中，二氧化碳不仅作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，还与烃类竞争吸附在催化剂表面。

2. 通过阻止烯烃吸附，二氧化碳减少了它们的后续聚合，并通过抑制丙烷吸附降低了丙烷的转化率。

3. 二氧化碳显著阻碍了镓系统中丙烯的形成，导致其产量下降。

4. 这可能是因为二氧化碳氧化了减少的镓氧化物物种，这些物种对于丙烷脱氢是必要的。

5. 在铬系统中，由于二氧化碳引入导致焦炭和氢气的氧化而增加的丙烯产率和操作稳定性，超过了负面影响。
