Propane Dehydrogenation on Chromium Oxide and Gallium Oxide Catalysts in the Presence of CO2 Yu. A. Agafonova, *, N. A. Gaidaia, , and A. L. Lapidusa aZelinsky Institute of Organic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, 119991 Russia *e-mail: plassey@mail.ru Received December 14, 2017 AbstractThe catalytic and physicochemical properties of GaOx/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 supported onto silica gels as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied with the use of stationary and nonstationary (a response method) techniques, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, and UV spectroscopy, and the effect of CO2 on the course of dehydrogenation reaction was examined. It was found that the relatively low acidity of silica gels prevents intense coke deposition and has a positive effect on the stability of catalyst operation. At the same time, the acid hydroxyls of these supports play an important role in the formation of a disperse active surface.

Answer: 
The study discusses the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) on the propane dehydrogenation process using chromium oxide (CrOx) and gallium oxide (GaOx) catalysts supported onto silica gels. The researchers found that the low acidity of silica gels helps prevent intense coke deposition, positively affecting the stability of the catalyst operations. The acid hydroxyls of the supports play a crucial role in forming a dispersed active surface. The study also examines how CO2 affects the adsorption of propane and propylene on the catalysts and its impact on the yield of propylene.
