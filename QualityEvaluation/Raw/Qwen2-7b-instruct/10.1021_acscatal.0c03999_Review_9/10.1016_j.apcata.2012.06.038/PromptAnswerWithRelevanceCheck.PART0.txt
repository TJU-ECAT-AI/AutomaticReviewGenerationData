[1] "The acidity of the Fe-ZSM-5 can be controlled by high temperature and steam treatments and Si/Al ratio."
[2] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
[3] "The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
[4] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. High temperature, steam treatments, and solid-state ion exchange methods result in catalysts with different active iron species and acidity levels. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Catalysts prepared through solid-state ion exchange exhibit comparable activity and better stability against coking compared to those made by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods. Weak and/or medium acid sites, along with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, enhance N2O activation and contribute to higher propene yields.

[1] "For example, it is clear that the acid-base properties of the ZSM-5 are important parameters in the performance of these types of catalysts."
[2] "They found that the activity in propane dehydrogenation decreased with increasing Si/Al ratio while the opposite trend was observed regarding the catalyst stability."
[3] "In contrast, Perez-Ramirez and Gallardo-Llamas reported that the initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-BEA prepared by hydrothermal synthesis was not affected by the catalyst acidity, the distribution of extra-framework iron species or the zeolite structure."
[4] "The present study compares, for the first time, a series of iron containing zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios (11.5140) and low iron content (0.9 wt.% Fe) synthesised by solid-state ion exchange using commercially available zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane following low temperature, high temperature or steam treatments."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Key performance metrics, such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Steam treatment increases the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method, enhancing activity for N2O decomposition and initial activity for ODHP of propane with N2O. Solid-state ion exchange leads to different active iron species such as large oxide clusters, small oxygen containing nanoclusters, and isolated iron species, affecting the acidity of the catalysts and influencing activity and selectivity for ODHP. Liquid exchange methods result in lower stability compared to solid-state ion exchange, possibly due to the formation of more stable active sites. Catalysts prepared by solid-state ion exchange show better stability towards coking compared to those prepared by hydrothermal synthesis methods.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对丙烷在N2O辅助下的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生不同的影响。关键性能指标，如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，展示了它们在不同反应条件下的有效性。蒸汽处理增加了由水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中的额外框架铁物种的数量，提高了N2O分解的活性和与N2O反应的丙烷脱氢活性。固态离子交换导致不同的活性铁物种，如大氧簇、小氧含量纳米簇和孤立的铁物种，影响催化剂的酸性并影响ODHP的活性和选择性。液相交换方法产生的稳定性低于固态离子交换方法，这可能是因为形成了更稳定的活性位点。通过固态离子交换制备的催化剂显示出更好的焦化稳定性，与通过水热合成方法制备的催化剂相比。

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. The solid-state ion exchange method, in particular, allows for the control of metal loading, exchange of multi-valent cations, reproducibility, and generation of different active sites, which contributes to the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The physical mixture was heated up to 550°C over 3 h and maintained at this temperature in air for 6 h. Thereafter, the samples were cooled to room temperature, washed thoroughly with deionized water, dried at 120°C, and calcined at 600°C in air for 1 h. The catalysts' performance is assessed based on several key metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, which indicate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Specifically:

1. Catalysts prepared through solid-state ion exchange exhibit higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared to other methods, and they show lower resistance to deactivation.
   
2. High temperature and steam treatments allow for the control of acidity in Fe-ZSM-5, which impacts the selectivity and yield of propene during the ODHP reaction.
   
3. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites with low aluminum contents and reduced acidity display the highest selectivity and yield of propene. This is attributed to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites along with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, enhancing N2O activation.
   
4. Compared to FeSiO2, catalysts over Fe-ZSM-5 show significantly higher initial propene yield, thanks to the aforementioned factors such as the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites and the enhancement of N2O activation.
   
5. Catalysts prepared using methods that result in extra-framework iron display higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for the ODHP reaction with N2O, showcasing distinct active iron species like large oxide clusters and small oxygen-containing nanoclusters.

1. Different synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment increases the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method, enhancing its activity. Solid-state ion exchange yields catalysts with various active iron species such as large oxide clusters, small oxygen containing nanoclusters, and isolated iron species, which can improve activity and selectivity for ODHP. Liquid exchange methods may have lower activity and stability compared to solid-state methods.
2. The type and concentration of oxidants significantly affect the activity and selectivity of Fe-ZSM-5 in ODHP. Monoatomic oxygen species formed during N2O activation play a crucial role in the conversion of propane to propene. Polyatomic oxygen species from O2 activation may also contribute to the reaction process.
3. Catalysts prepared through solid-state ion exchange exhibit different active iron species, including large oxide clusters, small oxygen containing nanoclusters like Fe4O4 and Fe3O4, and isolated iron species. These unique iron species contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity of the zeolites in ODHP.
4. High temperature treatments can increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5, potentially improving the activity and selectivity for N2O decomposition and ODHP of propane with N2O. Steam treatments also contribute to this effect.
5. The choice of oxidant type and concentration plays a critical role in the performance of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts for ODHP. Monoatomic oxygen species formed during N2O activation are responsible for the production of oxygenates, while polyatomic oxygen species from O2 activation can also participate in the conversion of propane to propene.
6. Solid-state ion exchange methods can produce highly active catalysts for ODHP, as demonstrated by the case of propane aromatization. This method allows for the formation of active sites that facilitate the desired chemical reactions efficiently.
