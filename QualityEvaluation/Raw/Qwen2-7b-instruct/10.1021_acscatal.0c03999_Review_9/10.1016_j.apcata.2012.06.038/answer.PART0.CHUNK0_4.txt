1. Different synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment increases the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method, enhancing its activity. Solid-state ion exchange yields catalysts with various active iron species such as large oxide clusters, small oxygen containing nanoclusters, and isolated iron species, which can improve activity and selectivity for ODHP. Liquid exchange methods may have lower activity and stability compared to solid-state methods.
2. The type and concentration of oxidants significantly affect the activity and selectivity of Fe-ZSM-5 in ODHP. Monoatomic oxygen species formed during N2O activation play a crucial role in the conversion of propane to propene. Polyatomic oxygen species from O2 activation may also contribute to the reaction process.
3. Catalysts prepared through solid-state ion exchange exhibit different active iron species, including large oxide clusters, small oxygen containing nanoclusters like Fe4O4 and Fe3O4, and isolated iron species. These unique iron species contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity of the zeolites in ODHP.
4. High temperature treatments can increase the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5, potentially improving the activity and selectivity for N2O decomposition and ODHP of propane with N2O. Steam treatments also contribute to this effect.
5. The choice of oxidant type and concentration plays a critical role in the performance of Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts for ODHP. Monoatomic oxygen species formed during N2O activation are responsible for the production of oxygenates, while polyatomic oxygen species from O2 activation can also participate in the conversion of propane to propene.
6. Solid-state ion exchange methods can produce highly active catalysts for ODHP, as demonstrated by the case of propane aromatization. This method allows for the formation of active sites that facilitate the desired chemical reactions efficiently.

1. 不同的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能产生影响。蒸汽处理增加了通过水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中额外框架铁物种的数量，从而提高其活性。固态离子交换方法产生的催化剂具有不同的活性铁物种，如大型氧化簇、含氧纳米簇（如Fe4O4和Fe3O4）以及孤立的铁物种，这些可以改善ODHP的活性和选择性。液相交换方法与固态方法相比可能具有较低的活性和稳定性。
2. 在ODHP中，不同类型的氧化剂和其浓度显著影响Fe-ZSM-5的活性和选择性。N2O激活过程中形成的单原子氧物种在丙烷转化为丙烯的过程中起关键作用。从O2激活过程中生成的多原子氧物种也可能参与反应过程。
