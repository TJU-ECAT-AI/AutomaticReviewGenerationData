[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."
[2] "They found that the activity in propane dehydrogenation decreased with increasing Si/Al ratio while the opposite trend was observed regarding the catalyst stability."
[3] "The high initial activity may be due to the presence of isolated and oligonuclear iron species in the extra-framework iron catalysts."
[4] "The type and concentration of oxidants have also been reported to affect the activity and selectivity of Fe-ZSM-5."
[5] "The present study compares, for the first time, a series of iron containing zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios (11.5140) and low iron content (0.9 wt.% Fe) synthesised by solid-state ion exchange using commercially available zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane following low temperature, high temperature or steam treatments."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. The solid-state ion exchange method, in particular, allows for the control of metal loading, exchange of multi-valent cations, reproducibility, and generation of different active sites, which contributes to the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The physical mixture was heated up to 550°C over 3 h and maintained at this temperature in air for 6 h. Thereafter, the samples were cooled to room temperature, washed thoroughly with deionized water, dried at 120°C, and calcined at 600°C in air for 1 h. The catalysts' performance is assessed based on several key metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, which indicate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对丙烷在N2O辅助下的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生不同的影响。尤其是固态离子交换方法，允许控制金属负载、交换多价离子、可重复性和生成不同活性位点，这有助于催化剂的活性和选择性。物理混合物加热至550°C，保持3小时，并在空气中维持此温度6小时。之后，样品冷却至室温，用去离子水彻底清洗，干燥至120°C，在空气氛围下于600°C煅烧1小时。催化剂的性能基于几个关键指标进行评估，包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标表明其在不同反应条件下的有效性。
