[1] "The acidity of the Fe-ZSM-5 can be controlled by high temperature and steam treatments and Si/Al ratio."
[2] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
[3] "The initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
[4] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. High temperature, steam treatments, and solid-state ion exchange methods result in catalysts with different active iron species and acidity levels. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Catalysts prepared through solid-state ion exchange exhibit comparable activity and better stability against coking compared to those made by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods. Weak and/or medium acid sites, along with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, enhance N2O activation and contribute to higher propene yields.

铁基ZSM-5沸石催化剂的合成方法显著影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能。高温、蒸汽处理和固态离子交换方法导致不同的活性铁物种和酸度水平。关键性能指标，如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，证明了不同反应条件下的有效性。通过固态离子交换制备的催化剂与通过液态离子交换和水热合成方法制备的催化剂相比，在焦炭化稳定性方面表现出相似的活性和更好的稳定性。弱或/和中等酸性位点，以及ZSM-5上的寡核铁物种和铁氧化物，增强N2O活化并有助于更高的丙烯产率。
