[1] "For example, it is clear that the acid-base properties of the ZSM-5 are important parameters in the performance of these types of catalysts."
[2] "They found that the activity in propane dehydrogenation decreased with increasing Si/Al ratio while the opposite trend was observed regarding the catalyst stability."
[3] "In contrast, Perez-Ramirez and Gallardo-Llamas reported that the initial propene yield over Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-BEA prepared by hydrothermal synthesis was not affected by the catalyst acidity, the distribution of extra-framework iron species or the zeolite structure."
[4] "The present study compares, for the first time, a series of iron containing zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios (11.5140) and low iron content (0.9 wt.% Fe) synthesised by solid-state ion exchange using commercially available zeolites for the dehydrogenation of propane following low temperature, high temperature or steam treatments."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Key performance metrics, such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Steam treatment increases the amount of extra-framework iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 prepared by hydrothermal method, enhancing activity for N2O decomposition and initial activity for ODHP of propane with N2O. Solid-state ion exchange leads to different active iron species such as large oxide clusters, small oxygen containing nanoclusters, and isolated iron species, affecting the acidity of the catalysts and influencing activity and selectivity for ODHP. Liquid exchange methods result in lower stability compared to solid-state ion exchange, possibly due to the formation of more stable active sites. Catalysts prepared by solid-state ion exchange show better stability towards coking compared to those prepared by hydrothermal synthesis methods.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对丙烷在N2O辅助下的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生不同的影响。关键性能指标，如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，展示了它们在不同反应条件下的有效性。蒸汽处理增加了由水热法制备的Fe-ZSM-5中的额外框架铁物种的数量，提高了N2O分解的活性和与N2O反应的丙烷脱氢活性。固态离子交换导致不同的活性铁物种，如大氧簇、小氧含量纳米簇和孤立的铁物种，影响催化剂的酸性并影响ODHP的活性和选择性。液相交换方法产生的稳定性低于固态离子交换方法，这可能是因为形成了更稳定的活性位点。通过固态离子交换制备的催化剂显示出更好的焦化稳定性，与通过水热合成方法制备的催化剂相比。
