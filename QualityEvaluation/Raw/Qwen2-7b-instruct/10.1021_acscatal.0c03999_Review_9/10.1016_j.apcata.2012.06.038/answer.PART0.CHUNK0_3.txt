[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared with solid-state method have been shown to have comparable activity and better stability towards coking compared with Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by liquid ion exchange and hydrothermal synthesis methods."
[2] "The acidity of the Fe-ZSM-5 can be controlled by high temperature and steam treatments and Si/Al ratio."
[3] "The selectivity and yield of propene were found to be the highest over Fe-ZSM-5 with low Al contents and reduced acidity."
[4] "Over Fe-ZSM-5, the initial propene yield was significantly higher than that of FeSiO2 since the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites together with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5 are found to enhance the N2O activation."
[5] "Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by methods leading to extra-framework iron led to catalysts having higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared with other methods of preparation."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Specifically:

1. Catalysts prepared through solid-state ion exchange exhibit higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for ODH of propane with N2O compared to other methods, and they show lower resistance to deactivation.
   
2. High temperature and steam treatments allow for the control of acidity in Fe-ZSM-5, which impacts the selectivity and yield of propene during the ODHP reaction.
   
3. Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites with low aluminum contents and reduced acidity display the highest selectivity and yield of propene. This is attributed to the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites along with oligonuclear iron species and iron oxides on the ZSM-5, enhancing N2O activation.
   
4. Compared to FeSiO2, catalysts over Fe-ZSM-5 show significantly higher initial propene yield, thanks to the aforementioned factors such as the presence of weak and/or medium acid sites and the enhancement of N2O activation.
   
5. Catalysts prepared using methods that result in extra-framework iron display higher activity for N2O decomposition and higher initial activity for the ODHP reaction with N2O, showcasing distinct active iron species like large oxide clusters and small oxygen-containing nanoclusters.

铁含量的沸石5型分子筛（Fe-ZSM-5）通过蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换等不同合成方法，在N2O辅助下进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中，其催化性能受到影响。关键性能指标如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率显示了它们在不同反应条件下的有效性。具体而言：

1. 通过固体离子交换制备的催化剂在N2O分解活性和丙烷与N2O的ODH活性方面比其他方法更高，并且表现出较低的失活倾向。

2. 高温和蒸汽处理允许控制Fe-ZSM-5的酸性，这影响了丙烯选择性和产率在ODHP反应中的表现。
   
3. 具有低铝含量和减少酸性的Fe-ZSM-5分子筛显示出最高的丙烯选择性和产率。这是由于ZSM-5上的弱或中等酸性位点的存在，以及寡核铁物种和铁氧化物的存在，从而增强N2O激活。

4. 相对于FeSiO2，Fe-ZSM-5催化剂具有显著更高的初始丙烯产率，这是因为上述因素，如弱或中等酸性位点的存在和N2O激活的增强。

5. 通过产生额外框架铁的方法制备的催化剂在N2O分解活性和丙烷与N2O的ODHP反应中显示出更高的初始活性，显示出独特的活性铁物种，如大的氧化簇和小的氧含纳米簇。
