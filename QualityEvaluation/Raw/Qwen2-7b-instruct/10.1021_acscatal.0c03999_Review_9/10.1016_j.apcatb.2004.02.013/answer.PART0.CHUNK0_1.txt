[1] "With respect to the catalytic activity and ease of catalyst manufacture, the wet ion-exchange based preparation method to prepare iron-zeolite is slightly favoured over alternative methods."
[2] "The pH of the suspension of the iron salt and the zeolite during WIE is a key factor in achieving catalysts with high activity in N2O decomposition."
[3] "The topology of the zeolite is also a key factor for both activity and stability under realistic practical conditions."
[4] "The (hydro-thermal) stability of WIE based Fe-BEA and FE-MOR is better than Fe-ZSM5."
[5] "However,over-exchange (Fe/Al ratio = 1), which can be achieved with the CVD method, but which is also a goal in studies on WIE preparation, is not a key factor in gaining high activity."

1. Among the synthesis methods investigated, the wet ion-exchange (WIE) method is slightly preferred for preparing iron-zeolite catalysts, particularly for their catalytic activity and ease of manufacturing.
2. Achieving high activity in N2O decomposition through WIE is influenced by the pH of the suspension of iron salt and zeolite.
3. The structure of the zeolite plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst under practical conditions.
4. Zeolites like BEA and MOR show better stability in the presence of high water content compared to ZSM5 under the same conditions.
5. Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which is a goal in WIE preparation, does not necessarily lead to high activity in N2O decomposition.

1. 在研究的合成方法中，湿离子交换（WIE）方法在制备铁沸石催化剂时略微更受欢迎，尤其是在催化活性和制造便利性方面。
2. 实现N2O分解中的高活性通过WIE受到铁盐和沸石悬浮液的pH影响。
3. 沸石的结构在决定催化剂的活性和实用性条件下都起着关键作用。
4. 比如BEA和MOR等沸石在高水分含量下表现出更好的稳定性，与ZSM5相同条件下相比。
5. 目标为Fe/Al比为1的过交换，在WIE准备中是一个目标，但不一定能导致N2O分解中的高活性。
