[1] "Zeolite supported iron catalysts were prepared by different methods and their catalytic performance was studied in the N2O decomposition reaction."
[2] "The preparation methods subject to investigation were the wet ion-exchange (WIE), chemical vapour deposition/sublimation and ex-framework method."
[3] "All catalysts were subjected to similar reaction conditions representative of exhaust emissions from nitric acid factories."
[4] "With respect to the catalytic activity and ease of catalyst manufacture, the wet ion-exchange based preparation method to prepare iron-zeolite is slightly favoured over alternative methods."
[5] "WIE based Fe-zeolite catalysts combine high N2O decomposition (and selective catalytic reduction, SCR) activity with good hydro-thermal stability."
[6] "The pH of the suspension of the iron salt and the zeolite during WIE is a key factor in achieving catalysts with high activity in N2O decomposition."
[7] "The topology of the zeolite is also a key factor for both activity and stability under realistic practical conditions."
[8] "However, over-exchange (Fe/Al ratio = 1), which can be achieved with the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method, but which is also a goal in studies on WIE preparation, is not a key factor in gaining high activity."
[9] "Wet ion-exchange yields a catalyst with less than 50% of the exchange sites occupied by Fe."

1. Various synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange were employed to prepare iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods influenced their catalytic performance, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, under different reaction conditions.

2. The wet ion-exchange (WIE) method is slightly favored over alternative methods in terms of catalytic activity and ease of catalyst manufacture. WIE-based Fe-zeolite catalysts exhibit high N2O decomposition (and selective catalytic reduction, SCR) activity along with good hydro-thermal stability.

3. The pH of the iron salt and zeolite suspension during WIE plays a critical role in achieving catalysts with high N2O decomposition activity. 

4. The topology of the zeolite is also a significant factor affecting both the activity and stability of the catalyst under realistic practical conditions.

5. Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which can be achieved with the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, is not essential for obtaining high activity in N2O decomposition under realistic conditions.

6. Wet ion-exchange results in a catalyst where less than 50% of the exchange sites are occupied by Fe.

1. 不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，被用来制备用于丙烷氧化脱氢(N2O辅助)的ZSM-5铁基催化剂。这些方法影响其在不同反应条件下的催化性能，包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

2. 湿离子交换(WIE)方法在催化活性和催化剂制造简便性方面略优于其他方法。基于WIE的Fe-沸石催化剂显示出高N2O分解（以及选择性催化还原，SCR）活性和良好的水热稳定性。

3. 在湿离子交换过程中，铁盐和沸石悬浮液的pH值对实现高N2O分解活性的催化剂至关重要。

4. 沸石的拓扑结构也是影响催化剂在实际应用条件下的活性和稳定性的关键因素。

5. 尽管化学气相沉积(CVD)方法可以实现Fe/Al比为1的过度交换，这是在WIE研究中追求的目标，但这种过度交换并不是在现实条件下获得高N2O分解活性的关键因素。

6. 湿离子交换产生一种催化剂，其中少于50%的交换位点被Fe占据。
