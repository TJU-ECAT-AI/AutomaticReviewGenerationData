1. Steam-activated iron zeolites, particularly FeZSM-5, are highly effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-cat.
2. The presence of extraframework iron species, which are produced during steam treatment, is crucial for the creation of active catalysts.
3. FeZSM-5 demonstrates exceptional resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA experiences a swift and complete deactivation.
4. The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably greater than that from commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with iron content 30-40 times lower), yet their residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar.
5. Steam-activated iron zeolites are highly effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-cat.
6. The initial yield of propene (C3H6) between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is similar, taking into account their iron content.
7. Mesopores are present in ex-FeZSM-5 due to dealumination during steam treatment, which is not found in ex-Fe-silicalite.
8. Coke formation physically blocks the active reaction sites within the zeolite's pore system, leading to a decrease in propene yield (C3H6).
9. The origin of coke formation is primarily associated with the condensation of propene, as indicated by a direct relationship between propene yield and the amount of coke determined through the TEOM method.
10. The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is notably higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.

1. 蒸汽活化的铁沸石是丙烷在N2O辅助下的氧化脱氢反应的高效催化剂，能够在723K和400,000ml/h/g-cat的空间速度下达到25%的丙烯产率。
2. 产生于蒸汽处理过程中的额外框架铁物种对于形成活性催化剂至关重要。
3. FeZSM-5表现出惊人的抗失活能力，而FeBEA则经历了快速且完全的失活。
4. FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率明显高于商业H-ZSM-5和H-BEA（铁含量低30-40倍），尽管它们在连续运行400分钟后残留的活性相似。
5. 蒸汽活化的铁沸石是丙烷在N2O辅助下的氧化脱氢反应的高效催化剂，能够在723K和400,000ml/h/g-cat的空间速度下达到25%的丙烯产率。
6. 考虑到它们的铁含量，从ex-FeZSM-5和ex-Fe-silicalite中丙烯（C3H6）的初始产率相似。
7. ex-FeZSM-5由于蒸汽处理过程中的铝流失而含有微孔，这是ex-Fe-silicalite中所没有的。
8. 焦炭的形成导致活性反应位点在沸石孔系统内部的物理阻塞，从而降低了丙烯（C3H6）的产率。
9. 焦炭的来源主要与丙烯的凝结有关，这可以从TEOM方法确定的焦炭量与丙烯产率之间的直接关系中看出。
10. ex-FeZSM-5在直接N2O分解中的活性明显高于ex-Fe-silicalite。
