2.1. Catalysts
The various zeolites studied are shown in Table 1. High-purity chemicals were used during preparations (>99.995%) to avoid any contamination of the samples. Details on the hydrothermal synthesis of FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite have been described elsewhere [13,14].

2.2. Reaction and coking studies
Reaction and coke deactivation studies were carried out in a Rupprecht & Patashnick TEOM 1500 pulse mass analyser. The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.

3. Results
Table 1 shows the chemical composition of the catalysts investigated. The synthesized Fe-zeolites have a very similar iron content, and the molar Si/Al ratio in ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA is nearly identical. The amount of iron in the steamed commercial ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA zeolites was 30-40 times lower.

Prefixes c- and ex- refer to calcined and steamed zeolites, respectively. a Chemical composition as determined from ICP-OES. b to: initial activity (after 2 min on stream). c tf: reaction parameters after 400 min on stream. d Traces of iron in commercial zeolites as determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis [14].

The various synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. The study reveals that the synthesized Fe-zeolites exhibit a similar iron content, while the steamed commercial ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA zeolites have an iron content 30-40 times lower compared to the synthesized ones. The performance metrics vary across the different catalysts, highlighting the impact of synthesis methods on their efficiency in the ODHP reaction.

各种合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对含铁ZSM-5沸石的催化性能在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中产生影响。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标展示了不同反应条件下的有效性。研究发现，合成的Fe-沸石具有相似的铁含量，而经过蒸汽处理的商业ex-H-ZSM-5和ex-H-BEA沸石的铁含量比合成的沸石低30-40倍。不同催化剂的性能指标存在差异，这表明合成方法对其在ODHP反应中的效率产生了影响。
