[1] "The various zeolites studied are shown in Table 1. High-purity chemicals were used during preparations (>99.995%) to avoid any contamination of the samples."
[2] "FeBEA was synthesized hydrothermally using tetraethylammonium (TEA+) as the template and fluoride anions as the mineralizer agent."
[3] "FeBEA was synthesized hydrothermally using tetraethylammonium (TEA+) as the template and fluoride anions as the mineralizer agent."
[4] "The as-synthesized samples, containing the different metals in the zeolite framework, were calcined in air at 823 K for 10 h and activated in flowing steam at ambient pressure (water partial pressure of 300 mbar and 30 ml STP min−1 of N2 flow) at 873 K for 5 h."
[5] "The catalytic performance of commercial NH4-ZSM-5 (CBV8020, P&Q) and NH4-BEA (CP814E, Zeolyst) was also evaluated."
[6] "The synthesis of Fe-zeolites involves hydrothermal treatment followed by calcination and steam activation."
[7] "The as-received samples were calcined and steamed according to the procedures described above, yielding ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA."
[8] "The initial propene yields over Fe-silicalite and ex-FeBEA largely differ (5 and 22%, respectively)."
[9] "The initial conversion and selectivity were quite similar in the steam-activated iron zeolites, regardless of the host (MFI vs BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite (ZSM-5 vs silicalite), and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron."
[10] "Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."
[11] "The initial performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites in ODHP with N2O is similar, but the deactivation behavior strongly differs."
[12] "The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species may play an essential role on the deactivation behavior too."
[13] "The final amount of coke in ex-FeZSM-5 (with a residual propene yield of 8%) is 3 times higher than in ex-Fe-silicalite and in the totally deactivated ex-FeBEA (Table 1)."
[14] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

The synthesis of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites involves hydrothermal treatment followed by calcination and steam activation. Different synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The catalytic performance is influenced by factors such as the type of zeolite (MFI or BEA), the acidic properties of the zeolite, and the catalyst constitution with respect to iron. Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities. The deactivation behavior strongly differs among the catalysts, with some showing rapid and complete deactivation and others maintaining a significant residual activity. The nature and location of the active extraframework iron species play a crucial role in the deactivation behavior. The final amount of coke is higher in ex-FeBEA compared to ex-FeZSM-5, and the higher deactivation resistance of ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is attributed to differences in iron constitutions and porous structures associated with the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成涉及水热处理、煅烧和蒸汽活化。不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，影响其在N2O辅助氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率，这些指标在不同反应条件下证明了它们的有效性。催化剂性能受多种因素的影响，如沸石类型（MFI或BEA）、沸石的酸性特性和催化剂中铁的构成。蒸汽活化对于实现高催化活性至关重要。催化剂的失活行为存在显著差异，一些催化剂表现出快速且完全失活，而其他催化剂则保持显著的残余活性。活性额外框架铁物种的性质和位置对失活行为起着至关重要的作用。最终焦炭量在ex-FeBEA中高于ex-FeZSM-5，而ex-FeZSM-5在与N2O的ODHP过程中具有较高的失活抵抗力，这归因于铁组成和原始沸石结构中铝的存在导致的孔隙结构差异。
