[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites are highly active and selective catalysts for the ODH of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml h1 g1 cat."
[2] "Initial propene yields over ex-FeZSM-5, ex-FeBEA, and the non-acidic ex-Fe-silicalite further indicates that the origin of the catalyst activity is mainly associated to the presence of extraframework iron species."
[3] "Significant iron clustering was observed in ex-FeZSM-5, where extraframework isolated iron ions and oligonuclear species in the zeolite channels coexist with iron oxide nanoparticles of 12 nm."
[4] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

1. Steam-activated iron zeolites exhibit remarkable efficiency in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving yields of up to 25% propylene at 723 K with high space velocities (400,000 ml h1 g1 cat).

2. The origin of the catalyst activity in iron zeolites is primarily linked to the presence of extraframework iron species, irrespective of the zeolite type (MFI, BEA, or silicalite) or acidity.

3. In the synthesized ex-FeZSM-5, significant iron clustering was identified, characterized by the coexistence of extraframework isolated iron ions, oligonuclear species within the zeolite channels, and iron oxide nanoparticles measuring 12 nm.

4. The enhanced resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 towards deactivation in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane remains unexplained. It might be attributed to differences in iron constitution or the distinct porous structure associated with aluminum presence in the original zeolite framework.

1. 蒸汽活化的铁沸石在氮氧化物辅助下的丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高效率，可以在723 K时达到高达25%的丙烯产率，并且具有高空间速度（400,000 ml h1 g1 cat）。

2. 铁沸石催化剂活性的起源主要与额外框架中的铁物种的存在有关，无论是否是MFI、BEA还是硅酸盐类型或酸性。

3. 在合成的ex-FeZSM-5中，观察到显著的铁聚集体，特征是额外框架中孤立的铁离子、在沸石通道内的寡核物种共存以及直径为12nm的铁氧化物纳米颗粒。

4. 对于蒸汽活化的ex-FeZSM-5在氮氧化物辅助下的丙烷脱氢反应中的快速去活化现象的增强，目前尚未完全解释。这可能归因于两种催化剂之间的铁构成差异或原始沸石框架中铝存在的不同多孔结构。
