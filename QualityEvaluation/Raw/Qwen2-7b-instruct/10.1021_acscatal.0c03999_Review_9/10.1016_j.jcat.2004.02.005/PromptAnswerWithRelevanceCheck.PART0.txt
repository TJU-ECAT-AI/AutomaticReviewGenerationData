3. FeZSM-5 demonstrates exceptional resistance against deactivation, whereas FeBEA experiences a swift and complete deactivation.
4. The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is notably greater than that from commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with iron content 30-40 times lower), yet their residual activities after 400 minutes of operation are similar.
5. Steam-activated iron zeolites are highly effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with N2O, achieving propylene yields of up to 25% at 723 K and space velocities of 400,000 ml/h/g-cat.
6. The initial yield of propene (C3H6) between ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-Fe-silicalite is similar, taking into account their iron content.
7. Mesopores are present in ex-FeZSM-5 due to dealumination during steam treatment, which is not found in ex-Fe-silicalite.
8. Coke formation physically blocks the active reaction sites within the zeolite's pore system, leading to a decrease in propene yield (C3H6).
9. The origin of coke formation is primarily associated with the condensation of propene, as indicated by a direct relationship between propene yield and the amount of coke determined through the TEOM method.
10. The activity of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is notably higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite.

[7] "This higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2 has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex-FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite."

The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite having 30-40 times lower iron content. Steam activation enhances catalytic activity, as evidenced by low conversion of reactants and propene yield in calcined iron zeolites. The presence of mesopores in FeZSM-5, due to dealumination upon steam treatment, contributes to better transport properties and active site accessibility, enhancing its performance in ODHP compared to Fe-silicalite.

1. 不同的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，影响含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗能力，而FeBEA则经历快速且完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率高于商业化的H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管它们的铁含量低30至40倍。蒸汽激活提高了催化活性，因为在煅烧的铁沸石中观察到低的反应物和丙烯产率转化率。由于蒸汽处理导致的去铝化，FeZSM-5中含有介孔结构，这有助于改善运输特性和活性位点的可访问性，从而增强其在ODHP中的性能与Fe-silicalite相比。

[4] "The higher deactivation resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 in ODHP with N2O is unclear at this stage, but can be tentatively related to the different iron constitutions in both catalysts and/or the different porous structure associated to the presence of aluminum in the original zeolite framework."

1. Steam-activated iron zeolites exhibit remarkable efficiency in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving yields of up to 25% propylene at 723 K with high space velocities (400,000 ml h1 g1 cat).

2. The origin of the catalyst activity in iron zeolites is primarily linked to the presence of extraframework iron species, irrespective of the zeolite type (MFI, BEA, or silicalite) or acidity.

3. In the synthesized ex-FeZSM-5, significant iron clustering was identified, characterized by the coexistence of extraframework isolated iron ions, oligonuclear species within the zeolite channels, and iron oxide nanoparticles measuring 12 nm.

4. The enhanced resistance of steam-activated ex-FeZSM-5 towards deactivation in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane remains unexplained. It might be attributed to differences in iron constitution or the distinct porous structure associated with aluminum presence in the original zeolite framework.

2.1. Catalysts
The various zeolites studied are shown in Table 1. High-purity chemicals were used during preparations (>99.995%) to avoid any contamination of the samples. Details on the hydrothermal synthesis of FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite have been described elsewhere [13,14].

2.2. Reaction and coking studies
Reaction and coke deactivation studies were carried out in a Rupprecht & Patashnick TEOM 1500 pulse mass analyser. The TEOM consists of a microreactor with a high-resolution microbalance that generates real-time measurements of mass changes during gas-solid reactions.

3. Results
Table 1 shows the chemical composition of the catalysts investigated. The synthesized Fe-zeolites have a very similar iron content, and the molar Si/Al ratio in ex-FeZSM-5 and ex-FeBEA is nearly identical. The amount of iron in the steamed commercial ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA zeolites was 30-40 times lower.

Prefixes c- and ex- refer to calcined and steamed zeolites, respectively. a Chemical composition as determined from ICP-OES. b to: initial activity (after 2 min on stream). c tf: reaction parameters after 400 min on stream. d Traces of iron in commercial zeolites as determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis [14].

The various synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. The study reveals that the synthesized Fe-zeolites exhibit a similar iron content, while the steamed commercial ex-H-ZSM-5 and ex-H-BEA zeolites have an iron content 30-40 times lower compared to the synthesized ones. The performance metrics vary across the different catalysts, highlighting the impact of synthesis methods on their efficiency in the ODHP reaction.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成涉及水热处理、煅烧和蒸汽活化。不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，影响其在N2O辅助氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率，这些指标在不同反应条件下证明了它们的有效性。催化剂性能受多种因素的影响，如沸石类型（MFI或BEA）、沸石的酸性特性和催化剂中铁的构成。蒸汽活化对于实现高催化活性至关重要。催化剂的失活行为存在显著差异，一些催化剂表现出快速且完全失活，而其他催化剂则保持显著的残余活性。活性额外框架铁物种的性质和位置对失活行为起着至关重要的作用。最终焦炭量在ex-FeBEA中高于ex-FeZSM-5，而ex-FeZSM-5在与N2O的ODHP过程中具有较高的失活抵抗力，这归因于铁组成和原始沸石结构中铝的存在导致的孔隙结构差异。
