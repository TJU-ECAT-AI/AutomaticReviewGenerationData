[1] "Steam-activated Fe-zeolites (MFI and BEA) are efficient catalysts for the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with ini- tial propylene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but deactivate as a result of coke formation."
[2] "The nature and dis- tribution of extraframework iron species, the zeolite host, and the catalyst acidity have no significant effect on the initial propene yield, but strongly influence the deactivation behavior."
[3] "FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while a very rapid and complete deactivation occurred in FeBEA."
[4] "The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA was remarkably higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA (with 3040 times lower iron content), although the residual activities after 400 min on stream were very similar."
[5] "Steam activation is essential for achieving high catalytic activities, as concluded from the low conversion of reactants and propene yield obtained over the calcined iron zeolites."
[6] "Ex-FeZSM-5 contains mesopores due to dealumination upon steam treatment, which are absent in ex-Fe-silicalite."
[7] "This higher conversion of N2O over ex-FeZSM-5 in Fig. 2 has been attributed to the larger fraction of iron as active oligonuclear iron species in ex-FeZSM-5, which favors oxygen desorption, as compared to ex-Fe-silicalite."

1. Various synthesis methods, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. FeZSM-5 shows a remarkable resistance against deactivation, while FeBEA undergoes rapid and complete deactivation. The initial propene yield over FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is higher than over commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, despite having 30-40 times lower iron content. Steam activation enhances catalytic activity, as evidenced by low conversion of reactants and propene yield in calcined iron zeolites. The presence of mesopores in FeZSM-5, due to dealumination upon steam treatment, contributes to better transport properties and active site accessibility, enhancing its performance in ODHP compared to Fe-silicalite.

1. 不同的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，影响含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。FeZSM-5显示出对失活的显著抵抗能力，而FeBEA则经历快速且完全的失活。FeZSM-5和FeBEA的初始丙烯产率高于商业化的H-ZSM-5和H-BEA，尽管它们的铁含量低30至40倍。蒸汽激活提高了催化活性，因为在煅烧的铁沸石中观察到低的反应物和丙烯产率转化率。由于蒸汽处理导致的去铝化，FeZSM-5中含有介孔结构，这有助于改善运输特性和活性位点的可访问性，从而增强其在ODHP中的性能与Fe-silicalite相比。
