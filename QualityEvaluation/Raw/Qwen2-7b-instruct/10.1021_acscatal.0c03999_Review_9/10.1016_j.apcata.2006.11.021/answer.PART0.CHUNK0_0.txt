1. Our investigation of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction with oxygen (O2), 18O2, and nitrogen dioxide (N2O) over vanadium oxides (V2O3, VO2, and V2O5) revealed the significance of changes in the vanadium oxides under reaction conditions on their catalytic performance. This study provided deeper understanding of the vanadium oxides catalyzed ODP reaction.

2. The conclusions drawn from this research enabled us to better understand the relationship between structure and reactivity in the ODP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides. 

3. To accurately establish structure-reactivity relationships in the ODP reaction, catalyst characterization should be carried out under controlled levels of propane and oxidant conversion. Minimization of concentration gradients of feed components across the catalyst bed should also be ensured.

4. The steady-state product selectivities in the ODP reaction over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined by the initial composition of the vanadium oxides. Instead, they are governed by the changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under reaction conditions.

5. The composition of the bulk and near surface regions of V2O3, VO2, and V2O5 under ODP conditions is influenced by the type of oxidizer used (O2 or N2O).

6. For a propane/oxygen mixture with a ratio of 2, vanadium species are stabilized in pentavalent and tetravalent oxidation states, with the former being the predominant state.

7. The oxidation state of vanadium decreases in the presence of N2O.

8. The choice of oxidizer impacts the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides.

9. Compared to reactions involving oxygen, direct propane oxidation to carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), as well as consecutive propane-ethylene oxidation, are significantly reduced in the presence of N2O.

10. The improved initial selectivity for propane (C3H6) can be attributed to the degree of reduction of vanadium sites. Higher reduction leads to higher selectivity.

11. It is hypothesized that the nature of oxygen species generated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive propane-ethylene and direct propane oxidation processes.

1. 我们对在氧气（O2）、18O2和氮氧化物（N2O）下，通过稳态催化测试以及原位紫外可见光谱、原位X射线衍射和离线X射线光电子能谱分析，研究了钒氧化物（V2O3、VO2和V2O5）在氧化脱氢反应（ODP）中的催化性能，揭示了反应诱导变化对于其催化性能的重要性。这项研究加深了我们对以钒氧化物为催化剂的ODP反应的理解。

2. 这些结论使我们能够更好地理解易于还原/氧化的氧化物中结构与反应性之间的关系。

3. 要准确建立ODP反应中结构-反应性关系，应进行在可控丙烷和氧化剂转化率下的催化剂表征，并尽量减少催化剂床中进料成分浓度梯度。

4. 在773 K时，ODP反应中单个钒氧化物的稳态产物选择性不取决于钒氧化物的原始性质。相反，它们由氧化物在反应条件下的内部和表面状态的变化所决定。

5. 在氧气（C3H8/O2=2）含有的混合物中，钒物种稳定在五价和四价氧化态，其中前者是主要状态。

6. 在N2O存在的条件下，钒的氧化状态会降低。

7. 氧化剂的选择会影响研究的钒氧化物的催化性能。

8. 相比于氧气，直接丙烷氧化为一氧化碳（CO）和二氧化碳（CO2），以及连续丙烯-乙烯氧化，在N2O存在下显著减少。

9. 初始丙烯（C3H6）选择性的提高可以归因于钒位点的还原程度；还原程度越高，选择性越高。

10. 假定从氧气和N2O生成的氧物种性质不同，并在连续丙烯-乙烯和直接丙烷氧化过程中发挥作用。

11. 预期氧气物种生成自氧气和N2O的性质不同，并在连续丙烯-乙烯和直接丙烷氧化过程中起作用。
