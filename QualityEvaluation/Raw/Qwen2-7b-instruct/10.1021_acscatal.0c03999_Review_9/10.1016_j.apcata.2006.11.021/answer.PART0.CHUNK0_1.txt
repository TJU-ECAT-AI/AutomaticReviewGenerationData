[2] "Steady-state ODP product selectivities over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined by the nature of fresh vanadium oxide. This is governed by reaction-induced changes of the bulk and surface states of the oxides under the ODP conditions."

[3] "Bulk and near surface composition of V2O3, VO2 and V2O5 under the ODP conditions is controlled by the applied oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O)."

[4] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."

1. To properly understand the relationship between structure and reactivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction over iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, catalyst characterization should be performed under controlled conditions, minimizing concentration gradients of feed components.

2. Steady-state product selectivities of ODHP reactions over various vanadium oxides at 773 K are not solely determined by the initial composition of the oxides. Instead, they are influenced by the changes in bulk and surface states of the oxides under reaction conditions.

3. The bulk and near surface composition of V2O3, VO2, and V2O5 during the ODHP reaction is regulated by the oxidizing agent used.

4. The nature of the oxidizing agent affects the catalytic performance of the vanadium oxides. Using nitrogen dioxide (N2O) instead of oxygen (O2) leads to a significant reduction in direct propane oxidation to CO and CO2, as well as consecutive propane oxidation to COx.

1. 要正确建立结构与反应性的关系，在铁基ZSM-5沸石的氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中，应通过在控制条件下进行催化剂表征，同时最小化进料组分浓度梯度。

2. 在773K下，不同钒氧化物的稳态产品选择性并非由初始氧化物的性质决定。相反，它们受氧化物在反应条件下的内部和表面状态变化的支配。

3. 钒3氧化物、VO2和V2O5在ODHP反应期间的内部和近表面组成受所使用的氧化剂的控制。

4. 氧化剂的性质影响了研究的钒氧化物的催化性能。使用氮氧化物（N2O）代替氧气导致直接丙烷氧化为CO和CO2，以及连续丙烷氧化为COx的显著减少。
