[1] "The main conclusions are: In order to adequately establish structurereactivity relationships in the ODP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidisable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion;concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed are to be minimized."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The main conclusion regarding catalyst performance and optimization in the ODP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides is that catalyst characterization should be carried out at predetermined degrees of propane and oxidant conversion, and concentration gradients of feed components should be minimized across the catalyst bed.

[1] "Steady-state ODP product selectivities over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined by the nature of fresh vanadium oxide. This is governed by reaction-induced changes of the bulk and surface states of the oxides under the ODP conditions."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The steady-state product selectivities of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not influenced by the original nature of the vanadium oxide. Instead, they are determined by the changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under the ODP reaction conditions.

在773 K下的稳态ODP产物选择性，对于单个钒氧化物而言，并非由新鲜钒氧化物的性质决定。而是由ODP反应条件下的氧化物内部和表面状态的变化所控制。

[1] "The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidizing agent modulates the catalytic performance of the examined vanadium oxides. Compared to oxygen-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (primarily) and consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are significantly diminished when N2O is used as the oxidizing agent.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
氧化剂调整了研究的钒氧化物的催化性能。与含氧气流相比，在使用N2O作为氧化剂时，直接的C3H8氧化为CO和CO2（主要为CO2），以及连续的C3H6氧化为COx显著减少。
