"In order to adequately establish structurereactivity relation- ships in the ODP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidisable oxides, catalyst characterization should be performed at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion;concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed are to be minimized."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The structure-reactivity relationships in the ODP reaction over easily reducible/reoxidizable oxides can be established more accurately by conducting catalyst characterization at controlled degrees of propane and oxidant conversion. This minimizes concentration gradients of feed components along the catalyst bed.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
为了在易于还原/氧化的氧化物上建立结构反应性关系，在ODP反应中，应通过在可控的丙烷和氧化剂转化率下进行催化剂表征来准确建立结构反应性关系。这可以最小化催化床内进料组分的浓度梯度。

"Steady-state ODP product selectivities over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined by the nature of fresh vanadium oxide. This is governed by reaction- induced changes of the bulk and surface states of the oxides under the ODP conditions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The steady-state product selectivities of the ODP reaction over individual vanadium oxides at 773 K are not determined by the nature of the fresh vanadium oxide. Instead, they are governed by the reaction-induced changes in the bulk and surface states of the oxides under the conditions of the ODP reaction.

在773 K时，单个钒氧化物的稳态ODP产物选择性不由新鲜钒氧化物的性质决定。相反，它们由ODP条件下氧化物的基体和表面状态的反应诱导变化所控制。

"The oxidizing agent tunes the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. As compared to O2-containing feeds, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (mainly) as well as consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are drastically reduced in the presence of N2O."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The oxidizing agent adjusts the catalytic performance of the studied vanadium oxides. Compared to feeds containing O2, direct C3H8 oxidation to CO and CO2 (primarily) and consecutive C3H6 oxidation to COx are significantly diminished in the presence of N2O.

"It is assumed that also the nature of oxygen species originated from O2 and N2O differs and plays a role in consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
It is presumed that the nature of oxygen species generated from O2 and N2O varies and influences both consecutive C3H6 and direct C3H8 oxidation.
