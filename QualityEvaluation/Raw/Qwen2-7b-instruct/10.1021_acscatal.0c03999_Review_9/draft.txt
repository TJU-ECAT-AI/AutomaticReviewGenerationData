1. The effectiveness and performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites as catalysts in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reactions: Impact of synthesis methods on catalytic performance and evaluation through key performance metrics

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2004.02.013\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2014.07.032\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2004.02.005\]. The synthesis of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, particularly through wet ion-exchange (WIE), chemical vapor deposition/sublimation, and ex-framework methods, profoundly impacts their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). For instance, Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized using ferrocene as the iron precursor demonstrates superior performance in ODHP with N2O, achieving a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1 after severe calcination. The identification of FeOAl species as active sites enables the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. The accumulation of organic species, primarily alkylbenzenes, during the reaction further enhances this process.

        Moreover, the nature and location of these active extraframework iron species play a critical role in the deactivation behavior of the catalyst. The presence of extraframework iron species generated during steam treatment is indispensable for producing active catalysts. Interestingly, steam-activated Fe-zeolites like FeZSM-5 show remarkable resistance against deactivation, contrasting with other materials like FeBEA, which experience rapid and complete deactivation.

        The initial propene yield from FeZSM-5 and FeBEA is significantly higher than those of commercial H-ZSM-5 and H-BEA, which contain 30-40 times less iron. Despite this difference, their residual activities after 400 minutes of operation remain quite similar. The mesopores present in ex-FeZSM-5 due to dealumination during steam treatment contribute to its superior performance compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, where coke formation physically blocks the active reaction sites within the zeolitic pore system, leading to a decreased C3H6 yield.

        Over-exchange, aiming for an Fe/Al ratio of 1, which can be achieved with chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is not essential for obtaining high activity in N2O decomposition. WIE yields a catalyst where less than 50% of the exchange sites are occupied by Fe, demonstrating that achieving high activity does not necessarily require saturation of the exchange sites.

        Remarkably, Fe-ZSM-5 maintains a stable propane conversion rate of approximately 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for more than 40 hours when the N2O/C3H8 ratio is 1:2. The direct N2O decomposition activity of ex-FeZSM-5 is significantly higher than that of ex-Fe-silicalite, highlighting its versatility and efficiency in N2O-assisted reactions.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the insights gained into the synthesis parameters, active site chemistry, and deactivation mechanisms to develop more efficient and selective catalysts. Specifically, optimizing the balance between catalyst activity, stability, and cost-effectiveness could lead to significant improvements in the efficiency of N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation processes. Additionally, exploring the integration of advanced materials science techniques, such as nanotechnology and hierarchical structures, might offer new avenues for enhancing the performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. The development of tailored catalysts that can withstand harsh operational conditions and maintain high activity over extended periods would represent a major step forward in this field.
