The catalytic oxidation of methane with O2 on SiO2 1 wt% /Mo/SiO2 and 4.3 wt% No/SiO2 catalysts leads to total oxidation to carbon oxides, CO and CO2. When N2O is used as the oxidizing agent, the reaction produces formaldehyde only on MoO3 supported on SiO2. During the first minutes of the reaction, the conversion is high (up to 30%) and subsequently drops rapidly.

Answer: The catalytic oxidation of methane with O2 leads to total oxidation to carbon oxides CO and CO2, whereas using N2O as an oxidizing agent results in the formation of formaldehyde. The initial conversion is high but drops rapidly over time.
