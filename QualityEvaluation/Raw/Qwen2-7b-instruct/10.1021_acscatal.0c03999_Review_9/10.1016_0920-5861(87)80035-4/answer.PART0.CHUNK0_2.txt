OXIDATION WITH 02

The catalytic oxidation of methane at temperatures higher than 5OO'C leads to carbon monoxide when using O2 ; whereas formaldehyde is produced with a good selectivity when N 0 is used.

INTRODUCTION

Natural gas is the major source of methane, containing 40 to 95 volume percent of CH4. The use of methane for other purposes than heat production is limited because of the difficulty to store and transport this compound.

EXPERIMENTAL

Catalysts The samples of MoO3 supported on SiO2. were prepared by impregnation of silica (Aerosil DEGUSSA 130 m2.g-') by an ammonium heptamolybdate solution,followed by evaporation under continuous stirring, and drying at llOC for 16 hours.

Catalytic activity measurements The catalytic activity measurements were performed in a fixed bed reactor,under continuous flow at atmospheric pressure.

RESULT AND DISCUSSION

Catalytic activity measurements The conversions and selectivities measured after establishment of the steady state are reported in table 1. The catalytic oxidation of methane with 02 on SiO*. 1 wt% /Mo/Si02 and 4.3 wtX No/'Si02 catalysts leads to total oxidation to carbon oxides,CQ and coy

Potential asurents in oxygen atsphere The surface potential values of the MoO3/SiO2 samples treated at 500C in pure oxygen, and in an oxygen-argon mixture (PO = 0.05 atm.) have been measured in the temperature range 200-500C and deported in figure 1.

The slopes of the straight lines obtained are equal to kT/ne and lead to values of n indicated in table 2.

TABLE 2 Nature of the adsorbed oxygen species on Mo031Si02 catalysts under an oxygen gas phase and at different temperatures Temperature range n Oxygen species 240-300C 1 O; 340-42O'C 2 o- > 450C 4 02-

Within the temperature range considered, O;, O- and 02- species are adsor- bed on an oxidized Mo03fSi02 catalyst,02A being the dominant species at the temperatures higher than 450C.

The same measurements done on the Si02 support show two temperature regions (figure 1). The n values calculated from the slope of the V = f(lnPo ) straight lines as indicated in table 3, show that now the O- is the dominant & ecies at high temperature.

When the Mo03/Si02 sample is reduced- in a hydrogen-argon flow (P,.,= 0.1 atm.) at 500 for 30 minutes, the potential value falls down, the%urface 152 becoming less negative.

After cooling at lOO*C, an oxygen flow was been inrodudnd the varfations of the pcrtentiai,Yrhenjincreasing the temperature,have been recorded and reported in figure 3.

The three temperature regions observed before can be seen again, but the potential variation between each plateau is now larger than in the case of the well oxidized sample.

Temperature range n Oxygen species 160-32o*c 7 0; > 32V'C 2 0- Potential measurements in N20 atmosphere The potential variations measured in the course of the reoxidation of the reduced Mo03/Si02 sample by a N20-argon flow fPN o = 0.1 atm.1 are shown in figure 3 and can be compared with the reoxdationy Oz.
At temperatures lower than 24O"C, surface potential values are lower than the corresponding values obtained under oxygen atmosphere.

In the 240-28OOC temperature range,potential values under O2 and N20 are equal. Between 280 and 480C, the potential value in 120 atmosphere is constant,and it rises rapidly between 490 and SOO*C.

In the temperature range 140-280C, the surface potential variations obtained in N20 atmosphere can be explained by the adsorption of 0; and O* species. created by the decompasition of N20 on the surface, folfowing: N20 + e- - N2 t O- 2 o- = O;te- 

At tperatus higher than 280% under oxygen atmosphere, O- species are in equilibrium with gaseous 02 molecules.

This is not the case in N20 atmos- phere ; the 0' species created by the N20 adsorption desorb to give gaseous 153 oxygen:the surface potential value is then constant.

In the temperature range 360-42O"C,under oxygen,the potential rises, as the O- species transform into 02-,which reoxidizes the reduced MOOS. Under N20, the O- species can either desorb or transform into 02-_ The stable potential value observed up to 48O'C shows that desorption is faster than reoxidation.Reoxidation only occurs at temperatures higher than 49O*C.

In the catalysis temperature range
(T > 550C),
02- can be adsorbed on the surface of Mo03/Si02 catalysts, in O2 as well as in N 0 atmosphere, the O- being an intermediate species giving 02- 2 adsorbed ions.

In the stationary state under
CH4
and O2 or N20 gaseous mixture,the two species O- and 02- can coexist on the surface.

Steady state surface potential measurements In general, the values of the surface potential decrease when the catalysts are exposed to the reaction mixture and reach stable values in a few hours.

Such steady state surface potentials for different reactant flows are reported in figure 4.

When MoO,/SiO2 catalysts are placed in CH4-02 or CH4-N20 gaseous mixtures at temperatures higher than 500C,the potential value is intermediate between the oxidized state (02 or N20) and the reduced state (CH4) (figure 4).

At constant temperature,the stationary potential values vary reversibly when increasing and decreasing the partial pressures of 02 or N20 and CH4_ The observed variations are in accordance with the following laws :

V = gln$ in case of oxygen
V = gln$ in case of nitrous oxide

Plots of the surface potential variations versus the logarithms of the partia't pressures of reactants are shown in figure 5. The slopes of the straight lines obtained equal kTI2e in both O2 and
N20
cases.

Such variations could be explained by a chanism of reduction and oxidation of the surface (lO,tt), The oxidation reaction step involves the adsorption of negative oxygen species;the reduction step is the attack /on these negative species by methane.

In the oxidation step, two electrons are given by the catalyst for one oxygen or nitrous oxide molecule.That could mean that the active oxygen species are O-(in the case of catalytic oxidation of methane by oxygen)and 02-(in the case of N20), The reduction-oxidation mechanisms proposed on the basis of the surface potential asurents are :155

in case of nitrous oxide:

The proposed mechanism is in accordance with the classification of oxygen species proposed in the literature (9,12) for the catalytic oxidation of hydrocarbons.

The O- species lead to total oxidation while the 02- species give partial oxidation products.

However recently Liu et al. (6) have conclu- ded to the contrary for the oxidation of methane.

Their EPR results obtained at low temperature have clearly demonstrated the generation of O- species and of methyl radical on these catalysts but these results were obtained far from the actual reaction conditions.

The results obtained in situ,reported in this work, complete Liu's et.al. results by demonstrating the role of 0 2- species in the selective oxidation process.

CONCLUSION
The adsorption of gaseous oxygen or nitrous oxide on Mo03/Si02 catalysts creates 02, O- and 02- species within the range of temperature
160-5OOY.
In the course of the catalytic oxidation of methane, the surface of the catalyst is partially reduced,out to a greater extent in the case of N20 than in the case oi Oz.
The catalytic oxidation of methane can be explained by a reduction-oxidation mechanism of the catalyst surface.
The negative oxygen species involved in the catalytic oxidation by oxygen is an O-; the main products formed are CO and
C02. In
the case of N20,the negative species taking part in the reaction are 02- species and formaldehyde is formed with a good selectivity.

The document provides information on the catalytic oxidation of methane on MoO3-supported on silica catalysts when oxygen or nitrous oxide is used as the oxidizing agent. The mechanism of the reaction is studied using surface potential measurements. The results indicate that both oxygen and nitrous oxide give O- species localized at the catalyst surface. At temperatures higher than 400°C, O- is transformed into O-. Methane reacts with these two negative oxygen species. The document also explains how the catalyst is more oxidized in the case of oxygen compared to nitrous oxide. The variations in the stationary potential observed when changing the partial pressures of methane and oxygen or nitrous oxide are consistent with the attack of methane on adsorbed oxygen species.

The document discusses the differences in reactivity of methane on MoO3-supported on silica catalysts when oxygen or nitrous oxide are used as oxidizing agents. The conversions and selectivities measured after reaching a steady state are reported in Table 1. The catalytic oxidation of methane with oxygen leads to total oxidation to carbon oxides, while with nitrous oxide, formaldehyde is produced with good selectivity. The presence of water in the flowing gas lowers the conversion and changes the selectivity, favoring CO production over CO2. The document also describes the surface potential measurements performed on the samples treated at 500°C in pure oxygen and in an oxygen-argon mixture, showing the presence of O-, O-, and O2- species on the surface. The nature of these species varies depending on the temperature range.
