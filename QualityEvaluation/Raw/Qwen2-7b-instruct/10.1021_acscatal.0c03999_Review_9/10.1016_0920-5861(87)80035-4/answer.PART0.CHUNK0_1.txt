[4] "The surface potential values of the MoO3/SiO2 samples treated at 500C in pure oxygen, and in an oxygen-argon mixture (PO = 0.05 atm.) have been measured in the temperature range 200-500C and deported in figure 1."
[5] "In the catalysis temperature range (T > 550C),02- can be adsorbed on the surface of Mo03/Si02 catalysts, in O2 as well as in N 0 atmosphere, the O- being an intermediate species giving 02- 2 adsorbed ions."
[6] "Such variations could be explained by a chanism of reduction and oxidation of the surface (lO,tt), The oxidation reaction step involves the adsorption of negative oxygen species;the reduction step is the attack /on these negative species by methane."

The study focuses on analyzing the differences in reactivity of methane when using MoO3 supported on silica catalysts with oxygen or nitrous oxide as oxidizers through surface potential measurements. Initially, methane conversion rates are high, reaching up to 30%, but they drop sharply over time. Methane undergoes total oxidation to carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide on these catalysts when using oxygen as an oxidizer. Surface potential measurements were conducted on MoO3/SiO2 samples at 500°C under pure oxygen and oxygen-argon mixtures across the temperature range of 200-500°C. At temperatures above 550°C, both oxygen and nitrous oxide can adsorb onto the surface of Mo03/Si02 catalysts, with oxygen- being an intermediate species that transforms into 02-. The observed surface potential changes suggest a reduction-oxidation process on the catalyst surface, involving the adsorption of negative oxygen species followed by methane's attack on these species.

本研究旨在通过表面电位测量技术，研究在二氧化钼负载于硅酸盐催化剂上，使用氧气或硝酸氧化物作为氧化剂时，甲烷反应性的差异。初期，甲烷的转化率较高，可达30%，但随后迅速下降。在使用氧气作为氧化剂的情况下，甲烷会进行完全氧化，生成二氧化碳和一氧化碳。在550°C以上的温度范围内，氧气和硝酸氧化物均可吸附至Mo03/Si02催化剂表面，其中氧-为中间物种，能转化为02-。进行的表面电位测量覆盖了200-500°C的温度范围，在纯氧及氧气-氩混合气下对MoO3/SiO2样品进行。观察到的表面电位变化可解释为催化剂表面的还原-氧化过程，涉及到负氧物种的吸附，随后由甲烷对其的攻击。
