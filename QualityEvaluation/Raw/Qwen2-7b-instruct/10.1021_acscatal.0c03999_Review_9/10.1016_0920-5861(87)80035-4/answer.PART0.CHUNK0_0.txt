The document discusses the differences in reactivity of methane when using oxygen or nitrous oxide as oxidizing agents on MoO3 supported on silica catalysts. It states that Liu et al. reported that using oxygen leads to the formation of ethanol and aldehyde, whereas nitrous oxide results in the selective production of formaldehyde. Surface potential measurements were conducted to study the nature of oxygen species involved in the catalytic oxidation process. The document also highlights that the surface of the catalyst becomes partially reduced during the catalytic oxidation of methane, with a greater extent of reduction observed when using nitrous oxide compared to oxygen. The catalytic oxidation process is explained through a reduction-oxidation mechanism of the catalyst surface, with oxygen species leading to total oxidation and nitrogen dioxide species resulting in partial oxidation with a good selectivity for formaldehyde production.

该文档探讨了在二氧化钼负载在硅酸盐催化剂上时，使用氧气或亚硝酸氮作为氧化剂的反应活性差异。它指出，刘等人报告称，使用氧气会导致乙醇和醛的生成，而使用亚硝酸氮则能选择性地产生甲醛。进行了表面电位测量以研究催化氧化过程中所涉及的氧物种性质。文档还强调，在甲烷的催化氧化过程中，催化剂表面部分被还原，使用亚硝酸氮时的还原程度比使用氧气时更大。通过催化剂表面的还原-氧化机制解释了催化氧化过程，其中氧物种导致完全氧化，而氮氧化二物种导致部分氧化，并且甲醛的生成具有良好的选择性。
