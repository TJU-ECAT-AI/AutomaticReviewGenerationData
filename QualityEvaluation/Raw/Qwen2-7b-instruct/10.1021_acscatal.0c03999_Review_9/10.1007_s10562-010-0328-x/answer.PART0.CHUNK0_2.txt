<p>The role of acidic centres for oxidation reaction has been extensively discussed in a number of papers. High thermal treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites, modifies catalyst acidity resulting in the reduction of protonic acidity, which was discussed in part 3.1 [1719], as well as bringing about the formation of iron (II) surface complexes in zeolite channels, as a result of the autoreduction process [30, 44]. According to the NMR study, reported by Derouane et al. [45], Brnsted acidity is indispensable for propane activation over modified zeolites. The quoted authors have argued that activation of propane occurs thanks to the presence of a dehydrogenation function located in the neighbourhood of Brnsted acidic sites in the channels of ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. High thermal treatments reduce protonic acidity, facilitating the formation of iron (II) surface complexes. Brnsted acidity is crucial for propane activation, ensuring its dehydrogenation near acidic sites in the ZSM-5 zeolite channels.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能有显著影响。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。高温处理降低质子酸性，促进铁（II）表面复合物的形成。Brnsted酸性对于丙烷激活至关重要，确保其在ZSM-5沸石通道中的脱氢发生在酸性位点附近。
