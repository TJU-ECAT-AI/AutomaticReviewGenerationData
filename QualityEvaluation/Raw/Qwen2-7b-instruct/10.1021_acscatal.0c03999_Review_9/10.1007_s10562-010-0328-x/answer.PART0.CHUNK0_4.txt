[1] "Iron modified zeolites of MFI structure, calcined at 873 and 1173 K, were doped with sodium cations in amounts corresponding to , ,  and to the total number of acidic centres, estimated from TPD of ammonia."
[2] "The effect of high temperature calcinations on the samples acidity was discussed in chapter 3.1."
[3] "Thermal treatment (873 and 1173 K) of iron modified zeolite ZSM-5 influenced both the acidity (Fig. 1) and oxidative activity of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites (Fig. 5)."
[4] "Oxidative activity of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites, studied in this paper was influenced both by thermal treatment of iron modified zeolites (873 and 1173 K) and by subsequent modification with sodium cations."
[5] "Over Fe-ZSM-5(600) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) catalysts, containing strong acidic sites, as in the case of alkaline free samples [8, 10] both cracking and ODH of propane occur as simultaneous reactions."
[6] "While, over alkaline free and alkaline modified Fe-ZSM-5(900) samples, deprived of strong protonic acids sites, ODH of propane occurs as a primary reaction, while cracking and total oxidation occur as subsequent reactions (Fig. 8)."

1. The synthesis methods that influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction include steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange. These methods alter the acidity and structure of the zeolites, impacting their performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield under different reaction conditions.
2. The key performance metrics demonstrating the effectiveness of these zeolites under different conditions are C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. These metrics are influenced by the nature and strength of acidic sites within the zeolites.
3. Over Fe-ZSM-5(600) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) catalysts, both cracking and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occur as simultaneous reactions due to the presence of strong acidic sites.
4. Over alkaline free and alkaline modified Fe-ZSM-5(900) samples, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs as a primary reaction, while cracking and total oxidation occur as subsequent reactions, owing to the absence of strong protonic acid sites.

1. 合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，会影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。这些方法改变沸石的酸性和结构，影响关键性能指标，如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同反应条件下。
2. 表征这些沸石有效性的关键性能指标是C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。这些指标受到沸石内酸性位点性质和强度的影响。
3. 在Fe-ZSM-5(600)和Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600)催化剂上，由于存在强酸性位点，丙烷的裂解和氧化脱氢同时发生。
4. 对于无碱和碱改性Fe-ZSM-5(900)样品，由于缺乏强质子酸性位点，丙烷的氧化脱氢作为主要反应发生，而裂解和完全氧化则作为后续反应发生。
