<p>Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites of MFI structure, calcined at 873 and 1173 K, were doped with sodium cations in amounts corresponding to , ,  and to the total number of acidic centres, estimated from TPD of ammonia.</p>
<p>Sodium modified Fe-ZSM-5(900) gradually lost their oxidative activity with an increase in the concentration of alkaline cations, while the activity of Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) changed slightly and diminished considerably only after significant removal of acidic centres.</p>
<p>The results of propane ODH reaction, performed at different contact times over alkaline free and alkaline modified Fe-ZSM-5 indicated, that oxydehydrogenation and cracking reactions on the samples calcined at 1173 K occurred as consecutive reactions, while in the presence of catalysts activated at 873 K, and characterised by strong acidic centres, both reactions occurred simultaneously.</p>
<p>The shortening of contact time over Fe-ZSM-5(900) as well as over Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900) resulted in a clear decrease in selectivity to cracking products and to CO2, while selectivity towards propene increased.</p>
<p>Over Fe-ZSM-5(600) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) catalysts, containing strong acidic sites, as in the case of alkaline free samples [8, 10] both cracking and ODH of propane occur as simultaneous reactions. While, over alkaline free and alkaline modified Fe-ZSM-5(900) samples, deprived of strong protonic acids sites, ODH of propane occurs as a primary reaction, while cracking and total oxidation occur as subsequent reactions.</p>

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Specifically, strong protonic sites support oxidative transformation of light paraffins, leading to simultaneous reactions of oxydehydrogenation and cracking of propane. Removing Brnsted acidity modifies the reaction pathway, causing cracking and total oxidation to occur as consecutive reactions instead. Shortening the contact time decreases selectivity to cracking products and increases propene selectivity. In Fe-ZSM-5(600) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) catalysts with strong acidic sites, cracking and ODH of propane occur simultaneously. Conversely, in Fe-ZSM-5(900) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900) catalysts lacking strong protonic acids sites, oxydehydrogenation of propane is the primary reaction, followed by cracking and total oxidation as subsequent reactions.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，影响它们在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能。关键性能指标，包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，展示了其在不同反应条件下的有效性。具体而言，强质子酸位点支持轻烷烃在N2O/Fe-ZSM-5系统的氧化转化，导致丙烷的同分异构化和裂解同时发生。移除Brnsted酸性位点修改了反应途径，使得裂解和总氧化作为后续反应发生。缩短接触时间减少了裂解产物的选择性并提高了丙烯选择性。在含有强酸性位点的Fe-ZSM-5(600)和Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600)催化剂中，裂解和丙烷的氧化脱氢同时发生。相反，在缺乏强质子酸位点的Fe-ZSM-5(900)和Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900)催化剂中，丙烷的氧化脱氢是主要反应，随后裂解和总氧化作为后续反应发生。
