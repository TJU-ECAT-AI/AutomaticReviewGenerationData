1. Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized through steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange were tested in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance was influenced by the nature and strength of acidic sites within the zeolites. Strong protonic sites supported oxidative transformations, while their removal altered the reaction pathway, making cracking and total oxidation occur as consecutive reactions instead of simultaneous reactions.

2. The catalytic activity of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites was highly dependent on the acidity and the presence of Brnsted acidic sites. In the presence of strong protonic sites, both cracking and ODHP of propane occurred simultaneously. However, the elimination of Brnsted acidity modified the reaction route, causing cracking and total oxidation to occur consecutively after propane was transformed to propene.

3. The performance metrics included C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The effectiveness of the zeolites was demonstrated under different reaction conditions based on these metrics.

4. The activity of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites was influenced by thermal treatments at 873 and 1173 K, followed by modification with sodium cations. The sodium cations penetrated the zeolite channels, neutralizing strong acid centers and reacting with medium and weak acid sites.

5. The results showed that the removal of 75% of acidic centers led to an increase in propene selectivity over the Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) sample, while the product distribution remained unchanged on the Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900) sample. 

6. Over catalysts calcined at 873 K, the selectivity towards propene, COx, and cracking products was nearly the same, demonstrating that strong acidic sites allowed both cracking and ODHP of propane to occur simultaneously.

1. 通过蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换合成的铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应时，催化性能受到沸石中酸性位点性质和强度的影响。强质子性位点支持氧化转化，而去除这些酸性位点改变了反应路径，使得裂解和总氧化作为连续反应而不是同时反应发生。

2. Fe-ZSM-5沸石的催化活性高度依赖于酸性和Brnsted酸性位点的存在。在存在强质子性位点的情况下，丙烷氧化脱氢和裂解同时发生。然而，去除Brnsted酸性位点修改了反应路径，导致裂解和总氧化作为连续反应在丙烷转化为丙烯后发生。

3. 性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。根据这些指标，在不同反应条件下证明了沸石的有效性。

4. Fe-ZSM-5沸石的活性受873K和1173K的热处理以及随后的钠离子修饰的影响。渗透到沸石通道中的钠离子消除了强酸中心并与中等和弱酸性位点反应。

5. 结果表明，去除60%的酸性中心导致Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600)样品中丙烯选择性的增加，而Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900)样品的产物分布保持不变。

6. 对于在873K煅烧的催化剂，丙烯、COx和裂解产物的选择性几乎相同，表明强酸性位点允许丙烷氧化脱氢和裂解同时发生。
