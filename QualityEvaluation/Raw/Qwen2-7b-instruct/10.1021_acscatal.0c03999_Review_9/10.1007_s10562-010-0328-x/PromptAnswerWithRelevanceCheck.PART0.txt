<p>Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites of MFI structure, calcined at 873 and 1173 K, were doped with sodium cations in amounts corresponding to , ,  and to the total number of acidic centres, estimated from TPD of ammonia.</p>
<p>Sodium modified Fe-ZSM-5(900) gradually lost their oxidative activity with an increase in the concentration of alkaline cations, while the activity of Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) changed slightly and diminished considerably only after significant removal of acidic centres.</p>
<p>The results of propane ODH reaction, performed at different contact times over alkaline free and alkaline modified Fe-ZSM-5 indicated, that oxydehydrogenation and cracking reactions on the samples calcined at 1173 K occurred as consecutive reactions, while in the presence of catalysts activated at 873 K, and characterised by strong acidic centres, both reactions occurred simultaneously.</p>
<p>The shortening of contact time over Fe-ZSM-5(900) as well as over Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900) resulted in a clear decrease in selectivity to cracking products and to CO2, while selectivity towards propene increased.</p>
<p>Over Fe-ZSM-5(600) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) catalysts, containing strong acidic sites, as in the case of alkaline free samples [8, 10] both cracking and ODH of propane occur as simultaneous reactions.

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Specifically, strong protonic sites support oxidative transformation of light paraffins, leading to simultaneous reactions of oxydehydrogenation and cracking of propane. Removing Brnsted acidity modifies the reaction pathway, causing cracking and total oxidation to occur as consecutive reactions instead. Shortening the contact time decreases selectivity to cracking products and increases propene selectivity. In Fe-ZSM-5(600) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) catalysts with strong acidic sites, cracking and ODH of propane occur simultaneously. Conversely, in Fe-ZSM-5(900) and Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900) catalysts lacking strong protonic acids sites, oxydehydrogenation of propane is the primary reaction, followed by cracking and total oxidation as subsequent reactions.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，影响它们在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能。关键性能指标，包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，展示了其在不同反应条件下的有效性。具体而言，强质子酸位点支持轻烷烃在N2O/Fe-ZSM-5系统的氧化转化，导致丙烷的同分异构化和裂解同时发生。移除Brnsted酸性位点修改了反应途径，使得裂解和总氧化作为后续反应发生。缩短接触时间减少了裂解产物的选择性并提高了丙烯选择性。在含有强酸性位点的Fe-ZSM-5(600)和Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600)催化剂中，裂解和丙烷的氧化脱氢同时发生。相反，在缺乏强质子酸位点的Fe-ZSM-5(900)和Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900)催化剂中，丙烷的氧化脱氢是主要反应，随后裂解和总氧化作为后续反应发生。

<p>The role of acidic centres for oxidation reaction has been extensively discussed in a number of papers. High thermal treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites, modifies catalyst acidity resulting in the reduction of protonic acidity, which was discussed in part 3.1 [1719], as well as bringing about the formation of iron (II) surface complexes in zeolite channels, as a result of the autoreduction process [30, 44]. According to the NMR study, reported by Derouane et al. [45], Brnsted acidity is indispensable for propane activation over modified zeolites. The quoted authors have argued that activation of propane occurs thanks to the presence of a dehydrogenation function located in the neighbourhood of Brnsted acidic sites in the channels of ZSM-5 zeolites.</p>

1. Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized through steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange were tested in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The catalytic performance was influenced by the nature and strength of acidic sites within the zeolites. Strong protonic sites supported oxidative transformations, while their removal altered the reaction pathway, making cracking and total oxidation occur as consecutive reactions instead of simultaneous reactions.

2. The catalytic activity of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites was highly dependent on the acidity and the presence of Brnsted acidic sites. In the presence of strong protonic sites, both cracking and ODHP of propane occurred simultaneously. However, the elimination of Brnsted acidity modified the reaction route, causing cracking and total oxidation to occur consecutively after propane was transformed to propene.

3. The performance metrics included C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The effectiveness of the zeolites was demonstrated under different reaction conditions based on these metrics.

4. The activity of Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites was influenced by thermal treatments at 873 and 1173 K, followed by modification with sodium cations. The sodium cations penetrated the zeolite channels, neutralizing strong acid centers and reacting with medium and weak acid sites.

5. The results showed that the removal of 75% of acidic centers led to an increase in propene selectivity over the Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600) sample, while the product distribution remained unchanged on the Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900) sample. 

6. Over catalysts calcined at 873 K, the selectivity towards propene, COx, and cracking products was nearly the same, demonstrating that strong acidic sites allowed both cracking and ODHP of propane to occur simultaneously.

1. 通过蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换合成的铁含量ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下进行丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应时，催化性能受到沸石中酸性位点性质和强度的影响。强质子性位点支持氧化转化，而去除这些酸性位点改变了反应路径，使得裂解和总氧化作为连续反应而不是同时反应发生。

2. Fe-ZSM-5沸石的催化活性高度依赖于酸性和Brnsted酸性位点的存在。在存在强质子性位点的情况下，丙烷氧化脱氢和裂解同时发生。然而，去除Brnsted酸性位点修改了反应路径，导致裂解和总氧化作为连续反应在丙烷转化为丙烯后发生。

3. 性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。根据这些指标，在不同反应条件下证明了沸石的有效性。

4. Fe-ZSM-5沸石的活性受873K和1173K的热处理以及随后的钠离子修饰的影响。渗透到沸石通道中的钠离子消除了强酸中心并与中等和弱酸性位点反应。

5. 结果表明，去除60%的酸性中心导致Na/Fe-ZSM-5(600)样品中丙烯选择性的增加，而Na/Fe-ZSM-5(900)样品的产物分布保持不变。

6. 对于在873K煅烧的催化剂，丙烯、COx和裂解产物的选择性几乎相同，表明强酸性位点允许丙烷氧化脱氢和裂解同时发生。
