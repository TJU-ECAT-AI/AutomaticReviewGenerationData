The synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as an iron precursor was found to yield Fe-ZSM-5 with superior performance. Specifically, the high isolation of FeOAl species, which account for approximately 60% of the total iron species, enables efficient activation and conversion of nitrous oxide. These FeOAl species facilitate the formation of stable mono-oxygen species that react with propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. The accumulation of organic species, primarily alkylbenzenes, is observed during the reaction, indicating the efficiency of the catalyst in converting propane. Notably, with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2, a stable propane conversion rate of around 13 mmol gcat -1 h-1 and a propylene production rate of around 6 mmol gcat -1 h-1 can be maintained for more than 40 hours, showcasing the effectiveness of the Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst under these conditions.

合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换对含铁ZSM-5沸石的催化性能在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应产生了影响。使用二茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换方法生成了Fe-ZSM-5催化剂，其性能表现出色。具体来说，高度孤立的FeOAl物种的形成，占总铁物种的大约60%，使得硝酸盐的有效激活和转化成为可能。这些FeOAl物种能够促进稳定单氧物种的形成，进而高效地与丙烷反应生成丙烯。在反应过程中观察到有机物种的积累，主要为烷基苯类化合物，表明催化剂在转换丙烷方面的效率。值得注意的是，在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的情况下，可以维持稳定的丙烷转化率约为每克催化剂每小时13毫摩尔，并且丙烯产率为每克催化剂每小时6毫摩尔，持续时间超过40小时，这表明Fe-ZSM-5催化剂在这些条件下的有效性。
