Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, was found to exhibit superior performance for ODHP with N2O. After severe calcination, Fe-ZSM-5-G was observed to have a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1. The synthesis of Fe-ZSM-5-E using FeCl3 as the iron precursor followed conventional solid-state ion exchange. The study revealed that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species resulted in the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which reacted with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. The accumulation of organic species, primarily alkylbenzenes, was observed during the reaction. Remarkably, a stable propane conversion rate of approximately 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of approximately 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 were maintained for over 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

各种铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对在氮氧化物辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生了影响。通过使用二茂铁作为铁前体进行固态交换制备的Fe-ZSM-5，被发现对于使用氮氧化物的ODHP具有优越的性能。经过严重的煅烧后，Fe-ZSM-5-G表现出30%的最大初始丙烯产率，在0.037 s−1的高周转频率下。Fe-ZSM-5-E通过常规的固态离子交换使用FeCl3作为铁前体制备。研究显示，氮氧化物在FeOAl物种上的化学吸附导致稳定单氧物种的形成，这些物种与气态丙烷反应生成丙烯，具有高选择性。在反应过程中观察到了有机物种的积累，主要为烷基苯。值得注意的是，在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的情况下，大约保持了13 mmol gcat−1 h−1的稳定丙烷转化率和大约6 mmol gcat−1 h−1的丙烯生成速率超过40小时。
