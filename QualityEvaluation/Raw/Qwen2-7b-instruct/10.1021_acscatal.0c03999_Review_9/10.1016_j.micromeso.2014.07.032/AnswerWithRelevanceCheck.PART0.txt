          [1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."
          [2] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1 could be obtained."
          [3] "FeOAl species were identified as the active sites."
          [4] "Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity."
          [5] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes."
          [6] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

          Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Fe-ZSM-5, prepared via solid-state exchange using ferrocene as the iron precursor, exhibits superior performance for ODHP with N2O. After severe calcination, Fe-ZSM-5 shows a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1. Active sites identified as FeOAl species enable the formation of stable mono-oxygen species through chemisorption of nitrous oxide, which then react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. Organic species, mainly alkylbenzenes, accumulate during the reaction. Remarkably, Fe-ZSM-5 maintains a stable propane conversion rate of about 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of about 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for over 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

          含铁ZSM-5沸石的不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生不同的影响。通过使用二茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换制备的Fe-ZSM-5，对于使用N2O的ODHP表现出优越的性能。经过严重煅烧后，Fe-ZSM-5展现出最大初始丙烯产率为30%，在0.037 s−1的高周转频率下。识别出的活性位点FeOAl物种通过硝酸盐的化学吸附形成稳定的单氧物种，随后与气态丙烷反应生成高选择性的丙烯。反应过程中观察到有机物种的积累，主要为烷基苯类化合物。值得注意的是，Fe-ZSM-5在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2的情况下，可以维持稳定的丙烷转化率约为每克催化剂每小时13毫摩尔，并且丙烯产率为每克催化剂每小时6毫摩尔超过40小时。
