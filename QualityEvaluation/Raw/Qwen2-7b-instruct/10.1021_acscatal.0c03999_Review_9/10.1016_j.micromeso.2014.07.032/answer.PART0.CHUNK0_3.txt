Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as the solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor and the conventional solid-state ion exchange using FeCl3 as the iron precursor, have been compared. These methods lead to different catalytic performances in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield under different reaction conditions.
