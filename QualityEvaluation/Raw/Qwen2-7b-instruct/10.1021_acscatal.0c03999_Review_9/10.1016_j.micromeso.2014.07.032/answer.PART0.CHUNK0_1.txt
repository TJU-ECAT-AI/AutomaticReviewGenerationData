1. Different synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Steam treatment involves the introduction of steam into the synthesis process, potentially altering the structure of the zeolite and affecting its catalytic activity. Solid-state ion exchange uses ions to replace others within the zeolite framework, while liquid exchange employs solvents to facilitate the replacement of ions. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.
2. Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor shows superior performance in the ODHP with N2O reaction. This method ensures that ferrocene, a precursor rich in iron, reacts with the zeolite to create an iron-rich catalyst. The preparation of Fe-ZSM-5 via solid-state exchange results in a catalyst with isolated FeOAl species as active sites, which are characterized by a simple constitution and a lack of Brnsted acid sites, making it an ideal model catalyst for studying the ODHP with N2O.
3. Fe-ZSM-5 prepared using both the solid-state exchange method with ferrocene and the conventional solid-state ion exchange method with FeCl3 can be used as catalysts for the ODHP with N2O. However, the choice of iron precursor might influence the properties and performance of the catalyst, leading to variations in the reaction outcomes.

1. 不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对含铁沸石ZSM-5在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生不同的影响。蒸汽处理通过引入蒸汽来改变合成过程，可能会影响沸石的结构和其催化活性。固态离子交换使用离子来替换框架内的其他离子，而液体交换则利用溶剂来促进离子的替换。这些关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，用于展示不同反应条件下的催化剂效能。
2. 使用铁前体为二茂铁的固态交换方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5，在N2O辅助下的ODHP反应中表现出优异的性能。这种方法确保二茂铁富集的铁与沸石反应，形成富含铁的催化剂。通过固态交换制备的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂具有孤立的FeOAl物种作为活性位点，这些活性位点具有简单的组成和几乎没有Brnsted酸性位点，使它成为研究N2O辅助下的ODHP的理想模型催化剂。
3. 使用二茂铁作为铁前体的固态交换方法和使用FeCl3作为铁前体的传统固态离子交换方法都可以用于制备用于N2O辅助的ODHP的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂。然而，铁前体的选择可能会对催化剂的性质和性能产生影响，导致反应结果的变化。
