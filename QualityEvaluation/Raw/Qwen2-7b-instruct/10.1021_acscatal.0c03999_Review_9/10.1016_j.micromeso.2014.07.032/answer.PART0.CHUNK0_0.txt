[1] "Fe-ZSM-5 was prepared via solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor and applied as a model catalyst to investigate the reaction and deactivation mechanisms of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with nitrous oxide."
[2] "Fe-ZSM-5 prepared via a solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as iron precursor has been found to exhibit superior performance for the ODHP with N2O after a severe calcination. A maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1 could be obtained."
[3] "FeOAl species were identified as the active sites."
[4] "Results from temperature-programmed experiments and in situ DRIFT spectroscopy suggest that the chemisorption of nitrous oxide on FeOAl species leads to the formation of stable mono-oxygen species, which can react with gaseous propane to produce propylene with high selectivity."
[5] "The accumulation of organic species in the catalyst is observed during the reaction, and the major organic species are determined to be alkylbenzenes."
[6] "Remarkably, a superior stable propane conversion rate of ca. 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of ca. 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 can be kept for >40 h with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Among these, the solid-state exchange method using ferrocene as the iron precursor yields the best performance. The Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst prepared via this method exhibits superior activity, achieving a maximal initial propylene yield of 30% at a high turnover frequency of 0.037 s−1. The active sites identified as FeOAl species play a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. These species chemisorb nitrous oxide, forming stable mono-oxygen species that react with propane to produce propylene with high selectivity. During the reaction, alkylbenzenes are the primary organic species accumulating in the catalyst. Importantly, the Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst maintains a stable propane conversion rate of around 13 mmol gcat−1 h−1 and a propylene production rate of around 6 mmol gcat−1 h−1 for more than 40 hours with a N2O/C3H8 ratio of 1:2.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对丙烷在亚硝酸氮辅助下的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生影响。其中，使用铁源作为前体的固态交换方法显示出最佳性能。通过这种方法制备的Fe-ZSM-5催化剂表现出优越的活性，在高周转频率为0.037 s−1的情况下，初始丙烯产率为30%。识别出的活性位点FeOAl物种在反应机制中起着关键作用。这些物种通过化学吸附亚硝酸氮形成稳定的单氧物种，随后与丙烷反应生成高选择性的丙烯。在反应过程中，主要的有机物种是烷基苯。值得注意的是，Fe-ZSM-5催化剂在N2O/C3H8比例为1:2时，能够保持稳定丙烷转化率约13 mmol gcat−1 h−1和丙烯产率约6 mmol gcat−1 h−1超过40小时。
