[1] "The structure and population of ion-exchanged Fe ions, Fe-oxo species, and Fe-oxo oligomers and Fe2O3 oxide particles and the concentration of acid sites in non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 were elucidated using semi-quantitative Mssbauer and FTIR analysis supplemented by UVVis and H2-TPR."
[2] "The steaming of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion- exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 appeared to be accompanied by substantial changes in the structure of the Fe species and to be beneficial for yields of phenol and also resulted in a lower rate of catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The present work is focused on the structural analysis of two Fe ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites of different crystal size with comparable low Fe concentrations (Fe/Al  0.15 at Si/Al  22) and their steamed forms by following their auto-reduction and interaction with molecular oxygen, N2O, and propane/N2O at the reaction temperature."
[4] "The steaming results in fewer Fe(II) ions capable of binding an oxygen atom from N2O (Fe(III)AO) and also in a decrease in the population of Fe(III)AOn- AFe(III) species connected with the cationic sites (300400 C), and an increase in polynuclear oligomeric Fe-oxo species and Fe-oxide- like species, reduced above 450 C."
[5] "Conversion of N2O to molecular elements and the turn-over-frequency values per total Fe (TOF s1) at 400 and 425 C over FeH-ZSM-5 and Fe(H)-ZSM-5st are given in Table 6."
[6] "Compared to N2O decomposition, the behavior of the non- steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites in propane/N2O reaction was more complex and reflected crystal size and changes occurring un- der steaming with respect to acid sites."

1. The structure and concentration of iron species in Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites were studied using Mssbauer, FTIR, UVVis, and H2-TPR techniques. Steam treatment influenced the structure and catalytic performance of Fe-ZSM-5.

2. Steam treatment of Fe-ZSM-5 led to significant changes in iron species, including a decrease in Fe(II) ions, and an increase in Td-coordinated Fe(III) and Fe-oxide-like particles.

3. The research focused on comparing two FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with different crystal sizes, both before and after steam treatment, under conditions of N2O, oxygen, and propane/N2O reactions.

4. Steam treatment resulted in a decrease in Fe(II) ions capable of binding N2O, a reduction in Fe(III)AOn-AFe(III) species, and an increase in Fe-oxide-like particles.

5. The conversion rates of N2O and the turnover frequencies per total Fe (TOF) were measured at 400 and 425°C for both FeH-ZSM-5 and steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st.

6. The reaction behavior of non-steamed and steamed Fe-zeolites in propane/N2O oxidation was influenced by crystal size and changes under steam treatment regarding acid sites.
