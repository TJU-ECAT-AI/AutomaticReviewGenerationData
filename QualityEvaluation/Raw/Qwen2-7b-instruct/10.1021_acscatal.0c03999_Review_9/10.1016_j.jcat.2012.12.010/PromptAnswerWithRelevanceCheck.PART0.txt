The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 

For instance, steaming of Fe-zeolites leads to a substantial decrease in the concentration of Brnsted sites, which is crucial for the ODHP reaction as it limits the formation of more reactive polyolefins that can be oxidized to CO/CO2. The steaming process also results in an increase in the concentration of Td-coordinated Fe(III) species, which are bound within extra-framework FeAAlASi species and small Fe-oxide particles. These species, along with Fe(II) ions in cationic sites, contribute to the ODHP reaction. 

The steaming process affects the concentration of various Fe species, such as bare Fe(II) ions, Fe(III) species, and Fe-oxide particles. The steamed Fe-zeolites show a higher concentration of Td-coordinated Fe(III) species compared to the non-steamed ones. This change in the Fe species' structure is associated with the activity and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in N2O decomposition and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with N2O.

In the steamed Fe-zeolites, the concentration of Fe(II) ions in cationic sites is notably lower, which is advantageous for the ODHP reaction as it reduces the propensity for propene to undergo oligomerization. The steamed zeolites also exhibit lower conversion of C3H8 and N2O compared to the non-steamed zeolites. However, the steamed zeolites show improved stability over time, which is beneficial for the ODHP reaction.

Overall, the synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites impact their performance in the ODHP reaction by influencing the concentration and structure of Fe species, Brnsted sites, and crystal size. These factors determine the efficiency of the zeolites in converting C3H8 and N2O to propene and CO/CO2, respectively.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能产生了显著影响。ODHP反应的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标显示了它们的有效性。

例如，蒸汽处理使Fe沸石的浓度明显下降，这有利于ODHP反应。蒸汽处理导致Brnsted酸位的浓度显著降低，这是关键的，因为它限制了更活泼的聚烯烃的形成，这些聚烯烃可以被氧化为CO/CO2。蒸汽处理还导致Td配位的Fe(III)物种浓度增加，这些物种位于额外的框架FeAAlASi物种内和小Fe-氧化物颗粒中。这些物种，以及在阳离子位点中的Fe(II)离子，都对ODHP反应有贡献。

蒸汽处理改变了各种Fe物种的浓度，包括裸露的Fe(II)离子、Fe(III)物种和Fe-氧化物粒子。与非蒸汽处理的Fe沸石相比，蒸汽处理的Fe沸石显示出更高的Td配位的Fe(III)物种浓度。这种Fe物种结构的变化与Fe沸石在N2O分解和丙烷氧化到丙烯与N2O的ODHP反应中的活性和时间-流行为有关。

在蒸汽处理的Fe沸石中，阳离子位点中的Fe(II)离子浓度明显较低，这对于ODHP反应是有利的，因为它降低了丙烷发生聚合的可能性。蒸汽处理的沸石也显示出比非蒸汽处理的沸石更低的C3H8和N2O转化率。然而，蒸汽处理的沸石显示出更好的稳定性，这对ODHP反应是有益的。

总的来说，铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法通过影响Fe物种的浓度、Brnsted位点和晶粒尺寸来影响其在ODHP反应中的性能。这些因素决定了这些沸石在将C3H8和N2O转化为丙烯和CO/CO2方面的效率。
