[1] "Differences in the concentration of the individual Fe species and acid sites were related to the activity and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in decomposition of N2O and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with N2O."
[2] "The steaming of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion- exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 appeared to be accompanied by substantial changes in the structure of the Fe species and to be beneficial for yields of phenol and also resulted in a lower rate of catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The concentration of acidic Brnsted sites in non-steamed and steamed Fe-ZSM-5 were elucidated using semi-quantitative Mssbauer and FTIR analysis supplemented by UVVis and H2-TPR."
[4] "The presence of high concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size of FeH-ZSM-5 stimulated oligomerization of formed propene decreasing its yield and increasing retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke."
[5] "The steaming of FeH-zeolites, dramatically changing the structure of Fe species and resulting in that only approximately 20% of the Fe(II) species originally present, yielded a significant decrease in TOF to 30% of the original value."
[6] "It can be concluded that a clear and similar decrease in TOF of N2O decomposition and concentration of Fe(II) in cationic sites from FeH- to steamed Fe(H)-ZSM-5st zeolites, and an increased population of Fe(III)-oxo species, particularly of Td-coordinated Fe(III), indicate that the most active sites for N2O decomposition are Fe(II) ions in cationic sites coordinated to framework rings containing an Al pair."

1. The activity and time-on-stream behavior of Fe-zeolites in the decomposition of N2O and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with N2O were influenced by differences in the concentration of individual Fe species and acid sites.

2. The steaming process of both the isomorphously substituted H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the ion-exchanged FeH-ZSM-5 led to substantial changes in the structure of Fe species, enhancing the yields of phenol and reducing the rate of catalyst deactivation.

3. The concentration of acidic Brnsted sites in Fe-ZSM-5 zeolites was analyzed using Mssbauer spectroscopy, FTIR, UVVis, and H2-TPR techniques.

4. High concentration of Brnsted sites and large crystal size in FeH-ZSM-5 facilitated oligomerization of propene, reducing its yield and promoting the retention of polyolefins up to polyaromatic coke.

5. Steaming of FeH-zeolites led to a significant decrease in turnover frequency (TOF) to 30% of the original value, primarily due to the dramatic changes in the structure of Fe species.

6. It was concluded that the most active sites for N2O decomposition are Fe(II) ions in cationic sites coordinated to framework rings containing an Al pair, as indicated by the clear and similar decrease in TOF of N2O decomposition and concentration of Fe(II) in steamed Fe-zeolites.

1. 铁-沸石催化剂在N2O分解和丙烷与N2O的氧化脱氢反应中的活性和时间-流行为，受到单个铁物种和酸性位点浓度差异的影响。

2. 对于等摩尔替换的H-[Fe]沸石-5和离子交换的FeH-沸石-5的蒸煮过程，导致了铁物种结构的重大变化，提高了苯酚的产率并降低了催化剂的失活速率。

3. 使用Mssbauer光谱、FTIR、UVVis和H2-TPR技术分析了Fe-沸石-5中酸性Brnsted位点的浓度。

4. 高浓度的Brnsted位点和较大的晶体尺寸在FeH-沸石-5中促进了丙烯的聚合，降低了其产率并促进了聚烯烃向多环芳烃的保留。

5. 对FeH-沸石的蒸煮导致了TOF的显著下降，降至原值的30%，主要原因是铁物种结构的剧烈变化。

6. 结论是，N2O分解最活跃的位点是与框架环中含两个Al原子对的正离子位点相协调的Fe(II)离子，这是由蒸煮Fe-沸石-5后N2O分解TOF的清晰且相似的降低以及Fe(II)浓度的增加所表明的。
