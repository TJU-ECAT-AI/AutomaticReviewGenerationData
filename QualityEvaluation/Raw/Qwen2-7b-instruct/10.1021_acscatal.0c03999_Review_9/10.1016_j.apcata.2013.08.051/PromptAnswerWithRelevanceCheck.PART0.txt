Steam treatment led to catalysts with the highest activity in terms of converting propane (C3H8). Solid-state ion exchange improved the efficiency of N2O conversion. Liquid exchange resulted in catalysts with high selectivity for C3H6 production. Under different reaction conditions, the performance of the catalysts varied significantly in terms of C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.
