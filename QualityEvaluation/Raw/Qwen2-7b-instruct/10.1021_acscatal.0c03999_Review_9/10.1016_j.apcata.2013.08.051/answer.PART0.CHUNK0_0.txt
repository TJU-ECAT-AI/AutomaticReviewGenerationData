The various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by affecting factors like C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. These factors demonstrate the effectiveness of the catalysts under different reaction conditions.
