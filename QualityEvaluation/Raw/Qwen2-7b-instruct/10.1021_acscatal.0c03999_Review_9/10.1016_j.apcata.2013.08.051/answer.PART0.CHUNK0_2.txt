The various synthesis methods, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, used to prepare iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites significantly influenced their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance was assessed based on several key metrics: C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. These indicators demonstrated the effectiveness of the catalysts under different reaction conditions.
