1. Various synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by altering their structure and reactivity. Key performance metrics including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

2. Catalyst A showed a higher propane conversion rate compared to Catalyst B.
3. Catalyst C exhibited a significantly higher N2O conversion efficiency than Catalyst D.
4. Propylene selectivity was found to be higher for Catalyst E than for Catalyst F.
5. Catalyst G achieved a higher propylene yield than Catalyst H.
