How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

Steam treatment led to catalysts with the highest activity in terms of converting propane (C3H8). Solid-state ion exchange improved the efficiency of N2O conversion. Liquid exchange resulted in catalysts with high selectivity for C3H6 production. Under different reaction conditions, the performance of the catalysts varied significantly in terms of C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

不同的合成方法（如蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换）如何影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能，以及在不同反应条件下体现其有效性的关键性能指标（包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率）？

蒸汽处理导致的催化剂在丙烷（C3H8）转化方面具有最高活性。固体离子交换提高了N2O转化效率。液体交换产生了高C3H6选择性产物的催化剂。在不同的反应条件下，催化剂在C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率方面的性能显著变化。
