The study investigated the catalytic performance of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in cracking C4-olefins. The acid strength of these samples was found to decrease in the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic test decreased in the opposite order. H-ZSM-5 zeolite was identified as the most suitable catalyst for cracking C4-olefins to produce propylene, especially when the zeolite has a smaller crystal size which exhibits higher stability over time.

研究了H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34这三种沸石在C4烯烃裂化反应中的催化性能。这些样品的酸强度按照以下顺序递减：H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite，而它们在催化测试中的稳定性则相反。H-ZSM-5沸石被确认为最适合用于裂化C4烯烃以生成丙烯的催化剂，特别是当沸石晶体尺寸较小时，其稳定性更高，并且能长时间保持稳定。
