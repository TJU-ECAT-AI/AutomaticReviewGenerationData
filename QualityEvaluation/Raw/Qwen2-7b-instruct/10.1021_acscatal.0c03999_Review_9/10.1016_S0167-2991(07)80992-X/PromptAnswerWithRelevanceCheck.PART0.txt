[1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[2] "For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[4] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[5] "Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable."
[6] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[7] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34,"
[8] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The development of more efficient processes for propylene production is crucial due to the increasing demand for propylene derivatives. Traditional methods, such as naphtha steam cracking, are costly and inefficient. FCC units also struggle to produce propylene efficiently. The metathesis process of ethylene and butylenes is unattractive as it consumes high-value ethylene. Therefore, integrating propylene production into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstocks, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins, is a promising approach. Zeolites, owing to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity, are widely utilized in industrial processes. This study focused on utilizing H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-SAPO-34 as catalysts for propylene production from C4-olefin cracking. Among these, H-ZSM-5 zeolite proved to be the most effective catalyst due to its high propylene yield and resistance to deactivation.

开发更高效的丙烯生产过程对于满足丙烯衍生物的日益增长的需求至关重要。传统方法，如石脑油蒸汽裂解，成本高且效率低。FCC单元也难以高效地生产丙烯。乙烯和丁二烯的裂合过程不吸引人，因为它消耗了主要原料的高价值乙烯。因此，将丙烯生产集成到炼油或石油化工厂中，从价值较低的原料，如C4-或更高碳数的烯烃催化裂解，是一种有前景的方法。由于其出色的热和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，沸石在工业过程中被广泛使用。本研究集中于利用H-蒙脱石、H-ZSM-5和H-SAPO-34作为C4-烯烃裂解产生丙烯的催化剂。其中，H-ZSM-5沸石证明是效果最佳的催化剂，由于其高丙烯产率和抗失活能力。

[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene. However, the traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2],which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost. Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive enough to limit the production of propylene.
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock. Thus the development of more reasonable processes with high yield of propylene is desirable. One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]. Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11].
In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34, covering the range of 12-, 10-, and 8-member-ring zeolites or zeotypes. Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield.

The development of processes for high-yield propylene production is crucial due to the increasing demand for propylene derivatives and the limitations of traditional methods. This paper investigates the use of zeolites, specifically H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34, in the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite is found to be the most suitable catalyst among the three, offering both resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield.

The study investigated the catalytic performance of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in cracking C4-olefins to produce propylene. The samples were synthesized hydrothermally using different templates. The acid strength of the samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite, while their stability followed the reverse order. Among the samples, H-ZSM-5 was found to be the most suitable catalyst for C4-olefin cracking, particularly due to its high resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield. Small-crystal-size H-ZSM-5 showed better stability compared to its larger counterpart.
