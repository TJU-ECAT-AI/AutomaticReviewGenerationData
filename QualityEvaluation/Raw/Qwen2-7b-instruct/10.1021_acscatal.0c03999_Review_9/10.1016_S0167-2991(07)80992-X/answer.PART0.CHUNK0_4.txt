The study investigated the catalytic performance of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in cracking C4-olefins to produce propylene. The samples were synthesized hydrothermally using different templates. The acid strength of the samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite, while their stability followed the reverse order. Among the samples, H-ZSM-5 was found to be the most suitable catalyst for C4-olefin cracking, particularly due to its high resistance to deactivation and high propylene yield. Small-crystal-size H-ZSM-5 showed better stability compared to its larger counterpart.

研究探讨了H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34这三种沸石在C4烯烃裂解生成丙烯的催化性能。样品通过不同的模板进行了水热合成。样品的酸强度按照H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite的顺序排列，而稳定性则相反。其中，H-ZSM-5被证明是最合适的催化剂用于C4烯烃裂解，特别是由于其出色的抗失活能力和高丙烯产率。小晶粒尺寸的H-ZSM-5比其大颗粒尺寸的稳定性更好。
