"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"G.-L. Zhaoa,b, J.-W Tenga, Z.-K Xie*a , W.-M Yanga, Q.-L Chena and Y. Tang*b"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study focuses on the catalytic cracking of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. The acid strength of the samples follows the order H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, and their stability in catalytic testing follows the order H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. Among these, H-ZSM-5 is the optimal catalyst for producing propylene from C4-olefin cracking, particularly when used in its small crystal size form which exhibits higher stability over time.

本研究关注了C4-烯烃在H-ZSM-5、H-蒙脱石和H-SAPO-34沸石上的催化裂化。这些样品的酸强度按照顺序排列为H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-蒙脱石，而在催化测试中的稳定性则为H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-蒙脱石。其中，H-ZSM-5是生产丙烯的最佳催化剂，特别是当使用其较小晶粒形式时，表现出更高的长时间稳定性。
