1. The preparation methods (ion-exchange and steam activation) and framework compositions (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and FeGeSi) influenced the iron speciation and acidic properties of the iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, affecting their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics included C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrating their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

2. Deactivation of iron zeolites in the ODHP reaction was primarily caused by the deposition of coke on active extra-framework iron species. 

3. The initial propylene yield was equivalent for fresh and regenerated FeGaSi zeolites, but the regenerated sample showed faster deactivation.

4. Air regeneration eliminated coke deposits, restoring the original porosity of the zeolite and maintaining its crystallinity. However, the regeneration process was not fully reversible.

5. The reason for the discrepancy in regeneration outcomes was not ascertainable based on the available information.

6. The TEM images of the regenerated FeGa-st sample revealed a significant clustering of iron species.

7. Our findings were groundbreaking, proving that the regeneration of iron-containing zeolites in N2O-mediated selective oxidations is not completely reversible.

8. The extraction of framework gallium, as indicated by the absorption band at 3670 cm1, altered the nature of the associated extra-framework iron species, leading to extensive clustering, as confirmed by TEM observations.

1. 制备方法（离子交换和蒸汽活化）和框架组成（FeAlSi、FeGaSi和FeGeSi）影响了铁含有的ZSM-5沸石中铁的物种和酸性性质，从而影响它们在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同反应条件下显示出其有效性。

2. 在ODHP反应中，铁沸石的失活主要由活性额外框架铁物种上的焦炭沉积引起。

3. 新鲜和再生后的FeGaSi沸石的初始丙烯产率相同，但再生样品的失活速度更快。

4. 空气再生消除了焦炭沉积，恢复了沸石的原始孔隙度并保持了其晶型。然而，再生过程并不是完全可逆的。

5. 基于可用信息，无法确定再生结果差异的原因。

6. 再生后的FeGa-st样品的透射电镜图像显示了铁物种的显著聚集体。

7. 我们的研究结果具有突破性意义，证明了N2O介导的的选择性氧化还原中铁含有的沸石的再生并非完全可逆。

8. 指示3670 cm1吸收带的提取框架镓导致了相关额外框架铁物种性质的变化，导致了广泛的聚集体形成，如透射电镜观察所示。
