1. The preparation method (ion-exchange and steam activation) and the framework composition (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and FeGeSi) influenced the iron speciation and acidic properties of the iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. These factors affected their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrated their effectiveness under different reaction conditions included C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 

2. Under the optimal reaction conditions of 723 K, the initial propylene yield was highest over FeGa-st (21%), followed by FeAl-lie (16%), and then FeGe-st (10%).

3. The initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st.

4. The propylene yield rapidly decayed over FeAl-lie and FeGe-st, especially in the liquid ion-exchanged sample, where it dropped from 16% to 2% during the first 40 minutes.

5. The cause of the mismatch in the regeneration process and its reversibility is currently unknown.

6. Although the initial propylene yield was the same for both the fresh and regenerated samples, the regenerated sample exhibited faster deactivation.

7. Recovery of the original porosity was observed in the regenerated zeolites, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact after regeneration.

1. 制备方法（离子交换和蒸汽活化）和框架组成（FeAlSi、FeGaSi和FeGeSi）影响了铁基ZSM-5沸石中铁的物种分布和酸性性质。这些因素影响了它们在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括在不同反应条件下丙烷的转化率、N2O的转化率、C3H6的选择性和C3H6产率。

2. 在最优反应条件723 K下，初始丙烯产率最高的是FeGa-st（21%），其次是FeAl-lie（16%），然后是FeGe-st（10%）。

3. 初始丙烷转化率为：FeGa-st为45%，FeAl-lie为40%，FeGe-st为19%。

4. 在FeAl-lie和FeGe-st中，丙烯产率迅速下降，尤其是在液态离子交换样品中，从最初的16%下降到最初的2%的前40分钟内。

5. 目前尚不清楚再生过程中的不匹配及其可逆性的原因。

6. 尽管新鲜和再生样品的初始丙烯产率相同，但再生样品的活性更快。

7. 再生后观察到了原始孔隙度的恢复，而晶格结构在再生过程中保持不变。
