[1] "Samples with different iron speciation and acidic properties, induced by the preparation method (ion-exchange and steam activation) and the framework composition (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and Fe GeSi) were analyzed."
[2] "Deactivation of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species."
[3] "Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact."
[4] "The initial propylene yield over the fresh and regenerated FeGaSi zeolites was the same, but the latter sample exhibited faster deactivation."
[5] "For example, the limited decrease in micropore volume of FeGa-st after the reaction strongly suggests that the main deactivation mechanism is formation of carbonaceous deposits obstructing the active surface, rather than the total inaccessibility of the active sites within the micropore network due to pore blockage."
[6] "Clearly, the regenerated FeGa-st catalyst did not exhibit the same performance as the fresh zeolite."
[7] "In situ infrared spectroscopy in combination with TEOMGC and additional characterization enabled us to monitor the processes and explain this behavior."

1. Different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

2. Deactivation of iron zeolites in the ODHP reaction is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species.

3. Air regeneration of the zeolites largely restores the original porosity and has no effect on the crystallinity, but the performance is not fully reversible. The initial propylene yield is equal in the fresh and regenerated samples, but the latter exhibits faster deactivation.

4. The main deactivation mechanism is the formation of carbonaceous deposits obstructing the active surface, rather than the total inaccessibility of active sites due to pore blockage.

5. The regeneration process leads to significant iron clustering, which results in a reduced number of active sites and a less efficient catalyst for ODHP, explaining the diminished performance of the regenerated zeolites compared to the fresh ones.

1. Various synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 

2. The key performance indicators show that steam treatment and solid-state ion exchange lead to higher C3H8 conversion and N2O conversion rates, as well as better C3H6 selectivity and C3H6 yield compared to liquid exchange methods. This is due to the formation of different iron speciation and acidic properties within the zeolite structure, which affects the efficiency of the ODHP reaction.

3. Steam activation of the zeolites leads to higher performance in the ODHP reaction. This is because steam treatment induces the hydrolysis of a fraction of SiOH-Ga groups, resulting in extra-framework gallium species. This increases the Brnsted acidity of the zeolite, which enhances the ODHP performance.

4. The FeGaSi zeolites display remarkable performance in the ODHP reaction, with a high initial propylene yield and stable performance for a relatively long period. This is attributed to the higher number of active iron centers for ODHP and the increased resistance against deactivation by coke deposition.

5. The regeneration process in air allows for the complete recovery of the original porosity of the zeolite, preserving its crystallinity. However, the regeneration is not fully reversible. The initial propylene yield remains the same, but the regenerated zeolite exhibits faster deactivation compared to the fresh zeolite. This is explained by the alteration of iron speciation during the first reaction-regeneration cycle, leading to a reduced number of active sites and thus a less efficient catalyst for ODHP.

1. 不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换铁基ZSM-5沸石，在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化性能有所不同。评价其有效性的关键指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

2. 这些指标显示，蒸汽处理和固态离子交换方法导致更高的C3H8转化率和N2O转化率，以及更好的C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，与液体交换方法相比。这是由于在沸石结构中形成不同铁物种和酸性性质的影响，这影响了ODHP反应的效率。

3. 蒸汽活化的沸石表现出更高的ODHP反应性能。这是因为蒸汽处理导致SiOH-Ga组分的水解，产生额外框架镓物种。这增加了沸石的Brnsted酸性，从而增强了ODHP性能。

4. FeGaSi沸石在ODHP反应中表现出出色的性能，具有较高的初始丙烯产率和较长时间的稳定性能。这是由于该催化剂中活性铁中心的数量较多，且对由焦炭沉积引起的去活化具有更强的抵抗力。

5. 空气再生过程使得原始孔隙度完全恢复，保持了晶格完整性。然而，再生过程并非完全可逆。初始丙烯产率保持不变，但再生后的沸石比新鲜沸石更快地失去活性。这可以解释为在第一次反应-再生循环中铁物种的改变，导致活性位点数量减少，从而降低了ODHP反应的效率。
