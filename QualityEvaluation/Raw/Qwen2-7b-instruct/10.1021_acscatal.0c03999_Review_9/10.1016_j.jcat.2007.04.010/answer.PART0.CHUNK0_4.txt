[1] "Samples with different iron speciation and acidic properties, induced by the preparation method (ion-exchange and steam activation) and the framework composition (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and FeGeSi) were analyzed."
[2] "At 723 K, the initial propylene yield (after 2 min on stream) was higher over FeGa-st (21%) than over FeAl-lie (16%) and FeGe-st (10%)."
[3] "The propylene yield decayed rapidly over FeAl-lie and FeGe-st, particularly in the liquid ion-exchanged sample (from 16 to 2% during the first 40 min on stream)."
[4] "As reported elsewhere [8,11], the initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st."
[5] "The C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to 50%."

1. The synthesis methods and properties of iron-containing MFI zeolites that influence their performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction include the preparation method (ion-exchange and steam activation) and the framework composition (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and FeGeSi). Key performance metrics include the initial propylene yield, C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 

2. The key performance metrics vary across different synthesis methods for iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. Specifically, the initial propylene yield was 21% over FeGa-st, 16% over FeAl-lie, and 10% over FeGe-st. The initial degree of C3H8 conversion was 45% over FeGa-st, 40% over FeAl-lie, and 19% over FeGe-st. The C3H6 selectivity over the three catalysts ranged from 40 to 50%.

1.XI公司通过不同的合成方法（离子交换和蒸汽活化）和框架组成（FeAlSi、FeGaSi和FeGeSi），影响它们在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应的性能。关键性能指标包括初始丙烯产率、C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

2. 不同合成方法的铁基ZSM-5沸石的关键性能指标存在差异。具体来说，FeGa-st的初始丙烯产率为21%，FeAl-lie为16%，FeGe-st为10%。FeGa-st、FeAl-lie和FeGe-st的初始C3H8转化率分别为45%、40%和19%。C3H6选择性在三种催化剂中从40到50%不等。
