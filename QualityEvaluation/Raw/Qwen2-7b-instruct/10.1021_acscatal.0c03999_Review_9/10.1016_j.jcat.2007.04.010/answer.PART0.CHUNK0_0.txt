[1] "Samples with different iron speciation and acidic properties, induced by the preparation method (ion-exchange and steam activation) and the framework composition (FeAlSi, FeGaSi, and Fe GeSi) were analyzed."
[2] "Deactivation of iron zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species."
[3] "Regeneration in air led to the disappearance of coke-related bands and the practically complete recovery of the original porosity, while the zeolite crystallinity remained intact."
[4] "The initial propylene yield over the fresh and regenerated FeGaSi zeolites was the same, but the latter sample exhibited faster deactivation."
[5] "For example, the limited decrease in micropore volume of FeGa-st after the reaction strongly suggests that the main deactivation mechanism is formation of carbonaceous deposits obstructing the active surface, rather than the total inaccessibility of the active sites within the micropore network due to pore blockage."
[6] "Clearly, the regenerated FeGa-st catalyst did not exhibit the same performance as the fresh zeolite."
[7] "In situ infrared spectroscopy in combination with TEOMGC and additional characterization enabled us to monitor the processes and explain this behavior."

1. Different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions.

2. Deactivation of iron zeolites in the ODHP reaction is caused by coke deposition on active extra-framework iron species.

3. Air regeneration of the zeolites largely restores the original porosity and has no effect on the crystallinity, but the performance is not fully reversible. The initial propylene yield is equal in the fresh and regenerated samples, but the latter exhibits faster deactivation.

4. The main deactivation mechanism is the formation of carbonaceous deposits obstructing the active surface, rather than the total inaccessibility of active sites due to pore blockage.

5. The regeneration process leads to significant iron clustering, which results in a reduced number of active sites and a less efficient catalyst for ODHP, explaining the diminished performance of the regenerated zeolites compared to the fresh ones.

1. 不同合成方法（如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换）的铁基ZSM-5沸石对丙烷在N2O辅助下的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能有影响。关键性能指标，如C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同的反应条件下证明了它们的有效性。

2. 在ODHP反应中，铁沸石的失活是由活性额外框架铁物种上的焦炭沉积引起的。

3. 空气再生使焦炭相关带消失，并基本上恢复了原始孔隙度，而晶格保持不变。然而，再生过程不是完全可逆的。新鲜和再生样品的初始丙烯产率相同，但后者表现出更快的失活。

4. 主要的失活机制是形成碳质沉积物阻碍活性表面，而不是由于孔堵塞导致活性位点的总体不可访问性。

5. 再生过程导致铁聚集体的显著增加，这导致活性位点数量减少，催化剂效率降低，解释了与新鲜样品相比，再生沸石的性能下降。
