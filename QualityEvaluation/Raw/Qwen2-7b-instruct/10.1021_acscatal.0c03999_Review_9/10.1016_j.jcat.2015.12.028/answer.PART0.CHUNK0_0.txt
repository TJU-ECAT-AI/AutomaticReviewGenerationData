1. Initial experiments for propane oxidation were conducted at temperatures of 673 and 703 K with a contact time of 2.1 seconds on samples containing varying percentages (1, 3, 5, and 7 wt.%) of vanadium supported on mesoporous silica.

2. As the reaction progressed, the conversion of propane decreased, and it was observed that the higher the reaction temperature, the quicker the catalyst deactivation occurred.

3. Surprisingly, the selectivity towards COx remained consistently low across all tested temperatures.

4. Alongside the decline in propane conversion, the selectivity towards propene and COx (CO, CO2) also reduced.

5. It was discovered that the swift deactivation of the 5V/SBA-3 catalyst during propane oxidation was predominantly caused by the reduction of vanadium rather than the formation of carbon deposits.

1. 初始实验在673和703 K的温度下进行，接触时间为2.1秒，样品包含不同百分比（1, 3, 5, 和7 wt.%）的氧化钒负载在介孔硅上。

2. 随着反应的进行，丙烷转化率降低，观察到反应温度越高，催化剂失活速度越快。

3. 值得注意的是，COx的选择性在整个测试温度范围内都保持较低水平。

4. 与丙烷转化率下降同时发生的是，丙烯和COx（CO、CO2）的选择性也减少了。

5. 研究发现，在丙烷氧化过程中，5V/SBA-3催化剂的快速失活主要归因于钒的还原，而不是碳沉积物的形成。
