[1] "The synthesis was performed under acidic conditions. The initial mole ratio of the reaction mixture was as follows: 0.11 TEOS:0.025 CTAB:1.94 HCl:9.17 H2O."
[2] "The correct vanadium concentration was confirmed by ICP (inductively coupled plasma) measurements performed on a Varian ICP-OES VISTA-MPX spectrometer."
[3] "Catalytic tests for propane and propene oxidation were performed in the presence of N2O as an oxidant in a continuous-flow reactor at two different temperatures: 673 and 703 K."
[4] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."
[5] "Simultaneously with propane conversion decrease, selectivity to propene and COx (CO, CO2) diminishes."
[6] "It was found that propene oxide, acrolein, and acetone are mostly primary products of propene oxidation, while propionaldehyde can also originate from PO isomerization."

1. The synthesis of SBA-3 mesoporous silica was conducted under acidic conditions, with an initial mole ratio of 0.11 TEOS:0.025 CTAB:1.94 HCl:9.17 H2O.
2. The correct vanadium concentration was confirmed via Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) measurements on a Varian ICP-OES VISTA-MPX spectrometer.
3. Propane and propene oxidation tests were executed in a continuous-flow reactor with N2O as the oxidant at two temperatures: 673 and 703 K.
4. With time on stream, propane conversion decreased, and this rate increased with higher reaction temperatures.
5. Alongside the decline in propane conversion, the selectivity towards propene and COx (CO, CO2) also reduced.
6. The majority of propene oxidation products were identified as propene oxide, acrolein, and acetone, with propionaldehyde originating from propene oxide isomerization.

1. SBA-3介孔硅酸盐的合成在酸性条件下进行，反应混合物的初始摩尔比为：0.11 TEOS:0.025 CTAB:1.94 HCl:9.17 H2O。
2. 通过Varian ICP-OES VISTA-MPX光谱仪的电感耦合等离子体（ICP）测量确认了正确的钒浓度。
3. 在连续流反应器中，以N2O作为氧化剂，对丙烷和丙烯进行了673K和703K两种不同温度下的氧化测试。
4. 随着时间的推移，丙烷的转化率下降，并且随着反应温度的升高，这种下降速度加快。
5. 丙烷转化率的降低伴随着丙烯和COx（CO、CO2）选择性的减少。
6. 大部分丙烯氧化产物被识别为丙烯氧化物、丙酮醛和丙酮，而丙酮醛则主要来源于丙烯氧化物的异构化。
