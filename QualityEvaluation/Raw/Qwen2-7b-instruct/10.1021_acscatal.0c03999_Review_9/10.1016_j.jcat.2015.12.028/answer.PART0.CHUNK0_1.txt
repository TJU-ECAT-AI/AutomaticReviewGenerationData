[1] "The correctness of the mesostructure of as-synthesized and the vanadium-modified SBA-3 samples was confirmed by XRD results displayed in Fig. 1. Incorporation of different amounts of vanadium (1, 3, 5, and 7 wt.%) resulted in some modification of XRD diffraction patterns; nevertheless, the hexagonally ordered structure of the meso- porous supports was still preserved."
[2] "Vanadium catalysts for propane oxidation undergo deactivation with time on stream. It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation."
[3] "Considering the alteration of selectivity toward oxygen-bearing products with propane/propene conversion influenced by reaction temperature and contact time, some tentative reaction paths for the selective oxidation of propane have been proposed."
[4] "Propane oxidation performed under an excess of N2O (propane:N2O = 1:15the reagent ratio usually applied for propene to PO oxidation [7,29]), when compared to the reagent ratio usually applied for the ODH reaction (N2O:propane = 1:1 [14] or 1.5:1 [26,30]) resulted not only in pro- pene and COx formation, but also in a significant amount of oxygen-bearing compounds: propene oxide (PO), propionaldehyde (PA), acetone (ACT), and acrolein (ACR) (Fig. 6)."
[5] "It was found that propene oxide, acrolein, and acetone are mostly primary products of propene oxidation, while propionaldehyde can also originate from PO isomerization."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by influencing their structure and accessibility of active sites. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include the conversion of propane (C3H8), the conversion of N2O, the selectivity of propene (C3H6), and the yield of propene. These factors depend on the specific synthesis method and the resulting properties of the zeolite. The text does not provide detailed information on how each individual synthesis method impacts these performance metrics specifically. The text focuses on the catalytic performance of vanadium catalysts for propane oxidation, rather than iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites.

Answer: The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites can affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by influencing their structure and accessibility of active sites. Key performance metrics, including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. The text does not provide detailed information on how each individual synthesis method impacts these performance metrics specifically.
