The catalyst preparation section describes the synthesis of SBA-3 mesoporous silica. The synthesis involves using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the silica source, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the cationic surfactant, and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as the acid source. The synthesis is performed under acidic conditions, and the initial mole ratio of the reaction mixture is given as 0.11 TEOS:0.025 CTAB:1.94 HCl:9.17 H2O.

The catalyst characterization section discusses the use of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) to check the mesostructure of the synthesized SBA-3 and vanadium-modified SBA-3 samples. The BET surface area and average pore diameter are estimated from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms collected at 77 K. The content of vanadium introduced into SBA-3 is estimated from inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements. Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UV-vis region are recorded to analyze the catalyst properties. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2 TPR) profiles are obtained to understand the surface properties of the catalysts. The decomposition of propan-2-ol to propene is studied at different temperatures using pulse method experiments.

The FTIR spectroscopy section describes the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the adsorption of reagents and propene oxide on the catalyst surface. The interaction of propane and propene with the surface of the catalyst is studied using FTIR spectroscopy. The adsorption of propane and propene leads to the formation of different adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. The adsorption of propane and propene oxide is studied at different temperatures to understand the transformation of these species on the catalyst surface.

The catalytic tests section discusses the performance of the vanadium catalysts in propane and propene oxidation reactions in the presence of N2O as an oxidant. The catalytic activities are calculated as the percentage conversion of propane or propene into products. The coke content on the studied catalysts is determined on the basis of elemental analysis. The carbon balance is kept within a certain limit for propane and propene oxidation reactions.

The results and discussion section provides insights into the catalyst characterization, FTIR results, propane oxidation, and propene oxidation. The catalyst characterization reveals the modification of XRD diffraction patterns due to the incorporation of vanadium. The UV-vis and H2 TPR measurements indicate the presence of well-dispersed vanadium species below the monolayer coverage. The FTIR results on adsorption of reagents and propene oxide provide information about the species formed during the oxidation reaction. The FTIR spectra of adsorbed species arising from the contact of the catalyst surface with the mixture of propane and N2O indicate the formation of oxygenates such as propionaldehyde, acetone, and acrolein. The FTIR spectra of adsorbed propene oxide show the transformation of propene oxide into other oxygenates with increasing temperature. The catalytic tests reveal the decrease in propane conversion and selectivity to propene and COx with time on stream. The contact time influences both propane conversion and selectivity to respective products.

The conclusions section summarizes the findings of the study. The propane oxidation to propene oxide on vanadium-modified SBA-3 mesoporous silica in the presence of N2O as an oxidant is demonstrated. It is suggested that propene oxide formation occurs from propene formed by a propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction and not directly from propane. Apart from propene oxide, other oxygen-bearing products such as propionaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, and COx are detected. Based on catalytic measurements and in situ FTIR study, the reaction paths of selective propane oxidation have been proposed. It is found that the rapid deactivation of the 5V/SBA-3 catalyst in propane oxidation is more due to the reduction of vanadium than to carbonaceous deposits.

合成SBA-3介孔二氧化硅的方法是使用四乙氧基硅烷（TEOS）作为硅源，十六烷基三甲基溴化铵（CTAB）作为阳离子表面活性剂，以及盐酸（HCl）作为酸源。合成在酸性条件下进行，反应混合物的初始摩尔比为0.11 TEOS：0.025 CTAB：1.94 HCl：9.17 H2O给出。催化剂表征部分讨论了使用粉末X射线衍射（XRD）检查合成的SBA-3和改性SBA-3样品的多孔结构。通过收集77 K的氮吸附/脱附等温线来估计BET表面积和平均孔径。从电感耦合等离子体（ICP）测量中估计了引入到SBA-3中的钒含量。记录了紫外-可见光区的散射反射谱以分析催化剂性质。氢气温度程序还原（H2 TPR）图谱用于理解催化剂表面的性质。在不同温度下研究丙烷-2-醇分解为丙烯的脉冲方法实验。
