[1] "The initial experiments for propane oxidation were performed at 673 and 703 K for a contact time equal to 2.1 s on samples of 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt.% of vanadium supported on mesoporous silica."
[2] "Propane conversion decreased with time on stream and it was noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the faster the deactivation."

[4] "Simultaneously with propane conversion decrease, selectivity to propene and COx (CO, CO2) diminishes."
[5] "It was found that the rapid deactivation of the 5V/SBA-3 catalyst in propane oxidation is more due to the reduction of vanadium than to carbonaceous deposits."

1. Initial experiments for propane oxidation were conducted at temperatures of 673 and 703 K with a contact time of 2.1 seconds on samples containing varying percentages (1, 3, 5, and 7 wt.%) of vanadium supported on mesoporous silica.

2. As the reaction progressed, the conversion of propane decreased, and it was observed that the higher the reaction temperature, the quicker the catalyst deactivation occurred.

3. Surprisingly, the selectivity towards COx remained consistently low across all tested temperatures.

4. Alongside the decline in propane conversion, the selectivity towards propene and COx (CO, CO2) also reduced.

5. It was discovered that the swift deactivation of the 5V/SBA-3 catalyst during propane oxidation was predominantly caused by the reduction of vanadium rather than the formation of carbon deposits.

1. 初始实验在673和703 K的温度下进行，接触时间为2.1秒，样品包含不同百分比（1, 3, 5, 和7 wt.%）的氧化钒负载在介孔硅上。

2. 随着反应的进行，丙烷转化率降低，观察到反应温度越高，催化剂失活速度越快。

3. 值得注意的是，COx的选择性在整个测试温度范围内都保持较低水平。

4. 与丙烷转化率下降同时发生的是，丙烯和COx（CO、CO2）的选择性也减少了。

5. 研究发现，在丙烷氧化过程中，5V/SBA-3催化剂的快速失活主要归因于钒的还原，而不是碳沉积物的形成。

[1] "The correctness of the mesostructure of as-synthesized and the vanadium-modified SBA-3 samples was confirmed by XRD results displayed in Fig. 1. Incorporation of different amounts of vanadium (1, 3, 5, and 7 wt.%) resulted in some modification of XRD diffraction patterns; nevertheless, the hexagonally ordered structure of the meso- porous supports was still preserved."
[2] "Vanadium catalysts for propane oxidation undergo deactivation with time on stream. It was noted that the higher the reaction temperature the faster the deactivation."
[3] "Considering the alteration of selectivity toward oxygen-bearing products with propane/propene conversion influenced by reaction temperature and contact time, some tentative reaction paths for the selective oxidation of propane have been proposed."
[4] "Propane oxidation performed under an excess of N2O (propane:N2O = 1:15the reagent ratio usually applied for propene to PO oxidation [7,29]), when compared to the reagent ratio usually applied for the ODH reaction (N2O:propane = 1:1 [14] or 1.5:1 [26,30]) resulted not only in pro- pene and COx formation, but also in a significant amount of oxygen-bearing compounds: propene oxide (PO), propionaldehyde (PA), acetone (ACT), and acrolein (ACR) (Fig. 6)."
[5] "It was found that propene oxide, acrolein, and acetone are mostly primary products of propene oxidation, while propionaldehyde can also originate from PO isomerization."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by influencing their structure and accessibility of active sites. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include the conversion of propane (C3H8), the conversion of N2O, the selectivity of propene (C3H6), and the yield of propene. These factors depend on the specific synthesis method and the resulting properties of the zeolite. The text does not provide detailed information on how each individual synthesis method impacts these performance metrics specifically. The text focuses on the catalytic performance of vanadium catalysts for propane oxidation, rather than iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites.

The catalyst preparation section describes the synthesis of SBA-3 mesoporous silica. The synthesis involves using tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the silica source, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the cationic surfactant, and hydrochloric acid (HCl) as the acid source. The synthesis is performed under acidic conditions, and the initial mole ratio of the reaction mixture is given as 0.11 TEOS:0.025 CTAB:1.94 HCl:9.17 H2O.

The catalyst characterization section discusses the use of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) to check the mesostructure of the synthesized SBA-3 and vanadium-modified SBA-3 samples. The BET surface area and average pore diameter are estimated from nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms collected at 77 K. The content of vanadium introduced into SBA-3 is estimated from inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements. Diffuse reflectance spectra in the UV-vis region are recorded to analyze the catalyst properties. Hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2 TPR) profiles are obtained to understand the surface properties of the catalysts. The decomposition of propan-2-ol to propene is studied at different temperatures using pulse method experiments.

The FTIR spectroscopy section describes the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to study the adsorption of reagents and propene oxide on the catalyst surface. The interaction of propane and propene with the surface of the catalyst is studied using FTIR spectroscopy. The adsorption of propane and propene leads to the formation of different adsorbed species on the catalyst surface. The adsorption of propane and propene oxide is studied at different temperatures to understand the transformation of these species on the catalyst surface.

The catalytic tests section discusses the performance of the vanadium catalysts in propane and propene oxidation reactions in the presence of N2O as an oxidant. The catalytic activities are calculated as the percentage conversion of propane or propene into products. The coke content on the studied catalysts is determined on the basis of elemental analysis. The carbon balance is kept within a certain limit for propane and propene oxidation reactions.

The results and discussion section provides insights into the catalyst characterization, FTIR results, propane oxidation, and propene oxidation. The catalyst characterization reveals the modification of XRD diffraction patterns due to the incorporation of vanadium. The UV-vis and H2 TPR measurements indicate the presence of well-dispersed vanadium species below the monolayer coverage. The FTIR results on adsorption of reagents and propene oxide provide information about the species formed during the oxidation reaction. The FTIR spectra of adsorbed species arising from the contact of the catalyst surface with the mixture of propane and N2O indicate the formation of oxygenates such as propionaldehyde, acetone, and acrolein. The FTIR spectra of adsorbed propene oxide show the transformation of propene oxide into other oxygenates with increasing temperature. The catalytic tests reveal the decrease in propane conversion and selectivity to propene and COx with time on stream. The contact time influences both propane conversion and selectivity to respective products.

The conclusions section summarizes the findings of the study. The propane oxidation to propene oxide on vanadium-modified SBA-3 mesoporous silica in the presence of N2O as an oxidant is demonstrated. It is suggested that propene oxide formation occurs from propene formed by a propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction and not directly from propane. Apart from propene oxide, other oxygen-bearing products such as propionaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, and COx are detected. Based on catalytic measurements and in situ FTIR study, the reaction paths of selective propane oxidation have been proposed. It is found that the rapid deactivation of the 5V/SBA-3 catalyst in propane oxidation is more due to the reduction of vanadium than to carbonaceous deposits.

合成SBA-3介孔二氧化硅的方法是使用四乙氧基硅烷（TEOS）作为硅源，十六烷基三甲基溴化铵（CTAB）作为阳离子表面活性剂，以及盐酸（HCl）作为酸源。合成在酸性条件下进行，反应混合物的初始摩尔比为0.11 TEOS：0.025 CTAB：1.94 HCl：9.17 H2O给出。催化剂表征部分讨论了使用粉末X射线衍射（XRD）检查合成的SBA-3和改性SBA-3样品的多孔结构。通过收集77 K的氮吸附/脱附等温线来估计BET表面积和平均孔径。从电感耦合等离子体（ICP）测量中估计了引入到SBA-3中的钒含量。记录了紫外-可见光区的散射反射谱以分析催化剂性质。氢气温度程序还原（H2 TPR）图谱用于理解催化剂表面的性质。在不同温度下研究丙烷-2-醇分解为丙烯的脉冲方法实验。

FTIR光谱部分描述了使用傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱研究催化剂表面的试剂和丙烯氧化物的吸附。使用FTIR光谱研究了丙烷和丙烯与催化剂表面的相互作用。丙烷和丙烯的吸附导致在催化剂表面上形成不同的吸附物种。在不同温度下研究了丙烷和丙烯氧化物的吸附，以了解这些物种在催化剂表面的转化情况。

催化测试部分讨论了在N2O作为氧化剂的情况下，使用范德华催化剂进行丙烷和丙烯氧化反应的性能。计算了丙烷或丙烯转化为产物的催化活性百分比。根据元素分析确定了研究催化剂的焦炭含量。保持丙烷和丙烯氧化反应中碳平衡的限制值。

结果与讨论部分提供了催化剂表征、FTIR结果、丙烷氧化和丙烯氧化的见解。催化剂表征揭示了由于引入了钒而导致XRD衍射模式的修改。紫外-可见光和H2 TPR测量表明，在低于单层覆盖的情况下存在分散良好的钒物种。FTIR结果对吸附剂和丙烯氧化物的研究提供了有关氧化反应期间形成的物种的信息。吸附在催化剂表面上的物种的FTIR光谱从丙烷和N2O混合物的接触中产生，指示形成了如丙酮醛、乙酸和丙烯醛之类的氧化物。吸附在丙烯氧化物上的FTIR光谱显示，随着温度的升高，丙烯氧化物转化为其他氧化物。催化测试揭示了随时间在流中下降的丙烷转化率和丙烯和COx的选择性。接触时间影响了丙烷转化率和各自产物的选择性。

结论部分总结了研究的结果。在N2O作为氧化剂的情况下，证明了在改性SBA-3介孔二氧化硅上进行丙烷氧化为丙烯氧化物。提出丙烯氧化物的形成发生在由丙烷氧化性脱氢（ODH）反应产生的丙烯上，而不是直接从丙烷产生。除了丙烯氧化物外，还检测到了其他含氧产物，如丙酮醛、乙酸和丙烯醛。基于催化测量和原位FTIR研究，提出了选择性丙烷氧化的反应路径。发现5V/SBA-3催化剂在丙烷氧化中的快速失活主要是由于钒的还原，而不是碳沉积物。
