<p>Results: From Fig. 1, it is observed that the addition of 3% CO2 into the feed leads to: (i) an increase in the propane conversion (+45%), (ii) a decrease in the yield of propylene (13%), (iii) a decrease in the selectivity to propylene (40%) and to CO2 (25%), and, finally, (iv) an increase in the conversion of oxygen (+11%).</p>
<p>Discussion: These results clearly show that, in the presence of CO2: (i) catalytic activity is higher, (ii)</p>

<p>Results: First, it is obvious that the intrinsic activity of CeO2 can be considered as being marginal. Second, it is shown that the simple physical contact with CeO2 allows an increase in the catalytic activity of the Pd(2 wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst (T50 = 668 versus 683 K).</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Firstly, the inherent activity of CeO2 is minimal. Secondly, it is demonstrated that merely contacting CeO2 physically with Pd(2 wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst enhances its catalytic activity (T50 = 668 K versus 683 K).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
首先，CeO2的固有活性很小。其次，仅将CeO2与Pd(2 wt.%)/Al2O3催化剂物理接触就能提高其催化活性（T50 = 668 K versus 683 K）。

<p>Results: Concerning the mixtures of these components, no reliable data could be obtained since those samples, obtained by slight mixing of both components by means of a spatula,were not homogeneous at all.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Regarding the mixtures of these components, no trustworthy data could be gathered as the samples, prepared by gently mixing both components with a spatula, were completely heterogeneous.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
对于这些成分的混合物，由于使用刮刀轻轻混合两种成分后得到的样品完全不均匀，因此无法收集到可靠的数据。

<p>Results: First of all, the overall C content in all the samples can be considered as constant, whether the test was run in the presence of CO2 or not. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the C 1s peak of those samples reveals that the relative proportion of the total amount of carbon which is bound to either C and/or H or to O remains unchanged (result not reported here).</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Primarily, the total C content across all samples stays consistent, irrespective of whether the test was conducted in CO2 presence or absence. Additionally, a thorough examination of the C 1s peak of these samples indicates that the proportion of carbon bound either to C and/or H or to O stays the same (results not detailed here).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
首先，所有样本中的总碳含量在CO2存在与否的情况下保持一致。此外，对这些样本的C 1s峰进行深入分析显示，绑定到C和/或H或O的碳总量的比例保持不变（未详细报告结果）。
