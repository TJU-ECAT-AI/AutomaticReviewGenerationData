<p>Results: First, it is obvious that the intrinsic activity of CeO2 can be considered as being marginal. Second, it is shown that the simple physical contact with CeO2 allows an increase in the catalytic activity of the Pd(2 wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst (T50 = 668 versus 683 K).</p>

<p>Results: First of all, the overall C content in all the samples can be considered as constant, whether the test was run in the presence of CO2 or not. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the C 1s peak of those samples reveals that the relative proportion of the total amount of carbon which is bound to either C and/or H or to O remains unchanged (result not reported here).</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Primarily, the total C content across all samples stays consistent, irrespective of whether the test was conducted in CO2 presence or absence. Additionally, a thorough examination of the C 1s peak of these samples indicates that the proportion of carbon bound either to C and/or H or to O stays the same (results not detailed here).

<quotes>
<p>Indeed, the addition of hydrogen induces changes from the activation energy point of view and, thus, modifies the reaction mechanism of the CCM. Second, the apparent change of EA is probably due to the combustion of H2 and not only to the fact that the oxidation state of the palladium has changed from PdO to metallic palladium; this further confirms the fact that the effect of H2 addition cannot be explained by a reduction of the palladium only.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. The addition of hydrogen alters the activation energy perspective and consequently modifies the combustion mechanism of methane. Secondly, the observed change in activation energy likely results from the combustion of hydrogen rather than solely from the change in palladium oxidation state from PdO to metallic palladium. This further validates that the impact of hydrogen addition is not solely due to the reduction of palladium.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
4. 添加氢气改变了激活能的角度，并且因此修改了甲烷燃烧机制。其次，观察到的激活能量的变化很可能是由于氢气的燃烧，而不是仅仅由于钯氧化态从PdO变为金属钯的结果。这进一步证实了氢添加的影响不仅仅是因为仅减少了钯。
