<p>From Table 1, it is observed that in presence of 2(monolayers)-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41, the addition of 1 or 5 vol.% N2O leads to an important decrease in the conversion (48 and 45%, respectively), a significant increase in the selectivity (+141 and +105%, respectively),and some increase in the yield of propylene (+22 and +13%,respectively).</p>

2. Adding 1 or 5 vol.% N2O to a 2-monolayer-NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41 catalyst results in a significant decrease in propane conversion (48% and 45% respectively), a substantial increase in propylene selectivity (+141% and +105% respectively), and a slight increase in propylene yield (+22% and +13% respectively).

2. 向2层NiMoO4/[Si,V]-MCM-41催化剂中添加1或5 vol.% N2O会导致丙烷转化率显著降低（分别为48%和45%），丙烯选择性大幅提高（分别为+141%和+105%），以及丙烯产率略有增加（分别为+22%和+13%）。

<p>First of all, it is clearly shown that a variation of the BET surface area of the catalyst during the reaction can be definitively ruled out, whether in presence of hydrogen or not.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
3. It is clearly demonstrated that there is no change in the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of the catalyst during the reaction, regardless of the presence of hydrogen.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
3. 明显表明，在反应过程中，催化剂的Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET)表面积没有变化，无论是否存在氢气。

<quotes>
<p>Indeed, the addition of hydrogen induces changes from the activation energy point of view and, thus, modifies the reaction mechanism of the CCM. Second, the apparent change of EA is probably due to the combustion of H2 and not only to the fact that the oxidation state of the palladium has changed from PdO to metallic palladium; this further confirms the fact that the effect of H2 addition cannot be explained by a reduction of the palladium only.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. The addition of hydrogen alters the activation energy perspective and consequently modifies the combustion mechanism of methane. Secondly, the observed change in activation energy likely results from the combustion of hydrogen rather than solely from the change in palladium oxidation state from PdO to metallic palladium. This further validates that the impact of hydrogen addition is not solely due to the reduction of palladium.

4. 添加氢气改变了激活能的角度，并且因此修改了甲烷燃烧机制。其次，观察到的激活能量的变化很可能是由于氢气的燃烧，而不是仅仅由于钯氧化态从PdO变为金属钯的结果。这进一步证实了氢添加的影响不仅仅是因为仅减少了钯。
