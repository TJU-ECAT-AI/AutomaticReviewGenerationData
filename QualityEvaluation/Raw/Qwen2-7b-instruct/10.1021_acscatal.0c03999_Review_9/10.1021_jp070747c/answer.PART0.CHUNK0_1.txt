<p>The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions.</p>
<p>By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2.</p>

1. In-situ UV/vis spectroscopy showed that the reduction degree of VOx species was higher under conditions of C3H8N2O compared to C3H8O2. 
2. Transient UV/vis analysis allowed distinguishing the reoxidation abilities of O2 and N2O towards reduced VOx species, with N2O reoxidizing these species more slowly than O2.
3. Transient isotopic experiments in the TAP reactor indicated that adsorbed oxygen species form upon O2 activation over reduced VOx species, participating in CO2 and CO formation.

1. 在原位UV/vis光谱分析下，发现C3H8N2O条件下的VOx物种还原度高于C3H8O2。
2. 通过瞬态UV/vis分析实验，区分了O2和N2O对还原VOx物种的再氧化能力，N2O的再氧化速度慢于O2。
3. 瞬态同位素实验在产品时间分析反应器中显示，在还原VOx物种上激活O2会形成吸附氧物种，参与CO2和CO的生成。
