[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, the use of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) as the oxidizing agent leads to superior performance compared to the use of oxygen (O2)."
[2] "The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy analysis revealed that the reduction degree of surface VOx species is higher in a C3H8N2O (C3H8/N2O = 1/1) feed than in a C3H8O2 (C3H8/O2 = 2/1) flow at controlled conversions of propane (<5%) and oxidizing agent (<10%)."
[3] "N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[4] "The results of transient isotopic experiments in the temporal analysis of products reactor revealed that adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species are formed upon O2 activation over reduced VOx species and participate in CO2 and CO formation."
[5] "It is suggested that these nonselective species do not originate from N2O."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include:

1. C3H8 conversion: The percentage of propane converted into other products.
2. N2O conversion: The efficiency of converting N2O into other products.
3. C3H6 selectivity: The ratio of propene produced to the total amount of products formed.
4. C3H6 yield: The amount of propene produced relative to the amount of propane fed into the reaction.

However, the provided literature does not provide specific details on how these synthesis methods affect the performance metrics mentioned above. The focus is on understanding the role of the oxidizing agent (O2 vs. N2O) in the ODP reaction and the redox behavior of vanadium oxide species supported over silica-based materials.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固相离子交换和液相交换，对其在氮氧化物辅助下丙烷的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能产生影响。体现其有效性的性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：丙烷转化为其他产物的百分比。
2. N2O转化率：将氮氧化物转化为其他产物的效率。
3. C3H6选择性：生成的丙烯与总产物形成的比率。
4. C3H6产率：输入反应的丙烷相对于生成的丙烯的数量。

然而，提供的文献没有提供这些合成方法如何影响上述提到的性能指标的特定细节。文献的重点在于理解氧化剂（O2与N2O）在ODP反应中的作用以及支持在硅基材料上的钒氧化物物种的还原行为。
