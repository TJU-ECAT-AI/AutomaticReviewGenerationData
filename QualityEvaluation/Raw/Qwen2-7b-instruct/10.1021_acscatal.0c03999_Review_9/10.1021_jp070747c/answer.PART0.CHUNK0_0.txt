[1] "The in-situ UV/vis method in a transient mode enabled to distinguish the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[2] "The ability of oxidant for reoxidation of reduced VOx species tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species; the lower the oxidizing ability, the higher the reduction degree of VOx species."
[3] "This improving effect of N2O is related to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, that is, to reducing surface density of active oxygen species."
[4] "On the basis of the results of transient isotopic experiments in section 3.4, it is suggested that the nature of oxygen species influences also the COx formation."
[5] "Adsorbed (nonlattice) oxygen species were suggested to be nonselective ones for the ODP reaction over VMgO 55,56 and Mn0.18V0.3Cr0.23W0.26OxAl2O3 57 catalytic materials."

1. The in-situ UV/vis method distinguishes the reoxidation ability of O2 and N2O, showing that N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2. This ability tunes the degree of reduction of vanadium species, with lower oxidizing ability leading to a higher reduction degree of VOx species. N2O's improvement in performance is attributed to spatial separation of active lattice oxygen species, reducing the surface density of active oxygen species. The nature of oxygen species, particularly adsorbed (nonlattice) species, influences COx formation, being nonselective in the ODP reaction over certain catalytic materials.

1. 内部原位UV/vis方法能够区分氧气和N2O对还原VOx物种的重新氧化能力；N2O对还原VOx物种的重新氧化速度比氧气慢。这种能力调节了钒物种的还原程度，较低的氧化能力导致VOx物种的更高还原度。N2O在性能上的改进与活性氧物种的空间分离有关，减少了活性氧物种的表面密度。氧气物种的性质，特别是吸附（非晶格）物种，在DP反应中被认为是某些催化剂材料的非选择性，影响COx的形成。
