[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over VOx/SiO2, VOx/MCM-41, and VOx/MCM-48, the in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy evidenced a higher degree of reduction of VOx species under C3H8N2O than C3H8O2 conditions."
[2] "By using this method in a transient mode, the ability of O2 and N2O for reoxidation of reduced VOx species was experimentally distinguished; N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species slower than O2."
[3] "Besides influencing the reduction degree of VOx species, N2O does not produce nonselective adsorbed oxygen species (possibly of biatomic nature), which are formed from O2 and catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx."

1. The in-situ UV/vis spectroscopy analysis showed that the degree of reduction of VOx species was higher under conditions of C3H8N2O compared to C3H8O2.
2. Through transient UV/vis analysis, it was found that N2O reoxidizes reduced VOx species more slowly than O2.
3. N2O, unlike O2, does not generate nonselective adsorbed oxygen species, which could catalyze nonselective consecutive propene oxidation to COx.

1. 原位UV/vis光谱分析显示，在C3H8N2O条件下，VOx物种的还原程度高于C3H8O2条件。
2. 通过瞬态UV/vis分析，发现N2O对还原的VOx物种的重新氧化比O2慢得多。
3. 与O2不同，N2O不会生成可能具有二原子性质的非选择性吸附氧物种，这些物种可以催化非选择性的丙烯连续氧化为COx。
