[1] "In order to gain information on vanadia distribution (isolated, polymerised sites), its reducibility and structure, phase composition and electronic proper- ties, differently-loaded vanadiaalumina supported materials were characterised using XRD, TPR, EPR, UVVIS-DRS, CPD and electrical conductivity mea- surements."
[2] "For materials with a vanadia loading in the range of 19.5 wt.%, the total conductivity decreased with oxygen partial pressure, as is typical for n-type semiconductors while for VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3,it did not depend on oxygen partial pressure, which corresponds to either an inherent dielectric or ionic conductor."
[3] "From these results, it can be derived that the oxygen species formed over the highly VOx-loaded alumina stay on the catalysts surface. However, these species desorb easily from alumina with low VOx loading."
[4] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism."
[5] "Thus, we assume that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were not discussed in the provided literature, so their influence on the catalytic performance in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) cannot be assessed. 
2. The key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of the catalysts under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 
3. The reduction of catalytic activity when oxygen is replaced by N2O can be attributed to the ability of N2O to oxidize the reduced catalyst material less fully and quickly than oxygen. 
4. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species plays a crucial role in controlling the selective oxidation and combustion reactions in the ODHP process. 
5. To enhance the selectivity of propene formation, the concentration of active lattice oxygen should be optimized, which is achieved by using N2O instead of O2.

1. 该文献未提及铁含量ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法对其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能的影响，因此无法评估其影响。
2. 在不同的反应条件下，证明催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。  
3. 当氧气被N2O取代时，催化剂活性降低的原因是N2O比氧气更少地完全快速地氧化还原催化剂材料。  
4. 活性晶格氧的稳态浓度在控制ODHP过程中的选择性氧化和燃烧反应中起着关键作用。  
5. 为了增强丙烯形成的选择性，应优化活性晶格氧的浓度，这可以通过使用N2O而不是氧气来实现。
