1. Materials with a low vanadia loading exhibit the highest surface area, decreasing significantly with higher vanadia content.

2. TPR spectra of VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 show a single peak at 868 K, attributed to the reduction of monomeric or low oligomeric VOx species.

3. TPR spectra of VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 display multiple peaks with maxima shifted to higher temperatures.

4. Over catalytic materials with predominantly isolated vanadium species, propane is initially oxidized to propene, which is further oxidized to COx. Over isolated vanadium species, propene and COx are formed directly from propane.

5. The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials increases with the content of deposited vanadia.

6. Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide decreases the initial rates of product formation across all temperatures studied.

7. For low amounts of vanadia (0.5 and 1 wt.%), the main products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) are formed directly from propane, indicating a decrease in direct propane oxidation to COx with increased vanadia concentration.

1. 含有较低钒含量的材料表现出最高的表面积，随着钒含量的增加，表面积显著减少。

2. VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 和 VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 的 TPR 谱图仅显示一个峰值，位于约 868 K，归因于单体或低寡聚物 VOx 物种的还原。

3. VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 和 VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 的 TPR 谱图显示多个峰值，最大值位于较高温度。

4. 在主要由孤立钒物种构成的催化材料上，丙烷首先被氧化为丙烯，随后丙烯被进一步氧化为 COx。在孤立的钒物种上，丙烯和 COx 直接从丙烷形成。

5. 催化剂材料的总电导率随沉积的钒含量的增加而增加。

6. 用 N2O 替换氧气导致所有温度下产品形成的初始速率降低。

7. 对于低含量的钒（0.5 和 1 wt.%），CO、CO2 和 C3H6 等主要产品直接从丙烷形成，表明随着钒浓度的增加，直接丙烷氧化为 COx 减少。
