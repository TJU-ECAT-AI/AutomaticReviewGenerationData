<p>The materials with a low vanadia loading (<1 wt.%) exhibit the highest surface area. With a further increase of vanadia content, the surface area decreases strongly.</p>
<p>For VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3, only a single peak of H2 consumption was observed with a maximum at ca. 868 K. This can be assigned to the reduction of monomeric or low oligomeric VOx species.</p>
<p>For VOx(4.6 wt.%)/-Al2O3 and VOx(9.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3, more peaks with maxima shifted to higher temperatures were observed in the TPR spectra.</p>
<p>Over catalytic materials with predominantly isolated vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane.</p>
<p>The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials increases with the content of deposited vanadia.</p>
<p>Replacing oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied.</p>
<p>For low amounts of vanadia, i.e., 0.5 and 1 wt.%, the selectivity-conversion plots show that all the main products (CO, CO2, and C3H6) are of primary nature. Increasing concentration of vanadia resulted in a decrease in direct propane oxidation to COx.</p>

2. VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3 和 VOx(1 wt.%)/-Al2O3 的 TPR 谱图仅显示一个峰值，位于约 868 K，归因于单体或低寡聚物 VOx 物种的还原。

[1] "In order to gain information on vanadia distribution (isolated, polymerised sites), its reducibility and structure, phase composition and electronic proper- ties, differently-loaded vanadiaalumina supported materials were characterised using XRD, TPR, EPR, UVVIS-DRS, CPD and electrical conductivity mea- surements."
[2] "For materials with a vanadia loading in the range of 19.5 wt.%, the total conductivity decreased with oxygen partial pressure, as is typical for n-type semiconductors while for VOx(0.5 wt.%)/-Al2O3,it did not depend on oxygen partial pressure, which corresponds to either an inherent dielectric or ionic conductor."
[3] "From these results, it can be derived that the oxygen species formed over the highly VOx-loaded alumina stay on the catalysts surface. However, these species desorb easily from alumina with low VOx loading."
[4] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism."
[5] "Thus, we assume that reducing the steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species enhances the selectivity of propene in the ODP, when O2 is replaced by N2O."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites were not discussed in the provided literature, so their influence on the catalytic performance in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) cannot be assessed. 
2. The key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of the catalysts under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. 
3. The reduction of catalytic activity when oxygen is replaced by N2O can be attributed to the ability of N2O to oxidize the reduced catalyst material less fully and quickly than oxygen. 
4. The steady-state concentration of active lattice oxygen species plays a crucial role in controlling the selective oxidation and combustion reactions in the ODHP process. 
5. To enhance the selectivity of propene formation, the concentration of active lattice oxygen should be optimized, which is achieved by using N2O instead of O2.

1. 该文献未提及铁含量ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法对其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能的影响，因此无法评估其影响。
2. 在不同的反应条件下，证明催化剂有效性的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。  
3. 当氧气被N2O取代时，催化剂活性降低的原因是N2O比氧气更少地完全快速地氧化还原催化剂材料。  
4. 活性晶格氧的稳态浓度在控制ODHP过程中的选择性氧化和燃烧反应中起着关键作用。  
5. 为了增强丙烯形成的选择性，应优化活性晶格氧的浓度，这可以通过使用N2O而不是氧气来实现。

[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."
[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[3] "The fundamental insights into phase composition,reduction, structure and dispersion of vanadium sites as well as electronic properties of VOx/-Al2O3 were derived from characterisation of the materials by XRD, TPR, EPR, UVVIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopies (UVVIS-DRS), contact potential difference (CPD) and electrical conductivity measurements."
[4] "As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."
[5] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
[6] "The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials increases with the content of deposited vana- dia."
[7] "In agreement with the redox mechanism of the ODP reaction (Eqs. (1) and (2)), a higher concentration of free electrons implies a higher rate of incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into lattice oxygen (the active oxygen species Eq. (2)), which influences the rate of propane activation (Eq. (1))."
[8] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
[9] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism."
[10] "This study has shown that catalytic performance of various VOx/-Al2O3 materials in ODP is strongly affected by the solid-material properties, i.e. reducibil- ity, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties and the ability of the catalyst to reoxidise reduced active sites."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The literature discusses how the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) performance varies with different synthesis methods of VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts. The key factors affecting performance include vanadium content, phase composition, reduction state, electronic properties, and the catalyst's ability to reoxidize reduced active sites. N2O as an oxidant increases propene selectivity while decreasing overall activity compared to O2. Polymeric vanadium species enhance propene selectivity, while isolated vanadium species favor direct propane oxidation. The electrical conductivity correlates with vanadium content, influencing the rate of oxygen incorporation and propane activation. Optimizing these properties is crucial for enhancing ODP performance.

文献讨论了不同合成方法下VOx/-Al2O3催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的性能变化。关键影响因素包括钒含量、相组成、还原状态、电子性质以及催化剂对还原活性位点的重新氧化能力。与氧气相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂可以提高丙烯选择性，同时降低整体活性。聚态钒物种增加了丙烯选择性，而孤立的钒物种更倾向于直接丙烷氧化。电导率与钒含量相关，影响氧的整合速率和丙烷激活速率。优化这些性质对于增强ODP性能至关重要。

[1] "The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials increases with the content of deposited vanadia (Table 1)."
[2] "Since these materials are predominantly n-conductors, the dependence of the conductivity on vanadia loading is attributed to an increase in the concentration of free electrons in the conduction band."
[3] "The characterisation results of the oxidised materials indicate that the degree of polymerisation of vanadia species is a strong function of vanadia loading."
[4] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
[5] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism."
[6] "Replacing gas-phase oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
[7] "From the above, it became obvious that catalytic performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic system depends on vanadia loading and the oxidant used."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials rises with the quantity of vanadia deposited, attributed to the increase in the concentration of free electrons in the conduction band within these predominantly n-conducting materials.

2. The degree of polymerization of vanadia species is significantly influenced by the vanadia loading according to the characterization outcomes of the oxidized materials.

3. Propane is primarily oxidized to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, whereas propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane over isolated vanadium species.

4. Over vanadiaalumina materials, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) happens via a redox mechanism, as indicated by conductivity and UVVIS data.

5. Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide leads to a decline in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures.

6. It is evident that the catalytic performance of the VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic system relies on vanadia loading and the oxidant employed.

7. The catalytic efficiency is notably impacted by vanadia distribution and oxidant activation, as demonstrated through changes in the initial rates of product formation and selectivity when oxygen is substituted with nitrous oxide.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The initial rates of products formation during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) were derived from differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials with varying amounts of vanadium (0.5 to 9.5 wt.%). Two oxidants were used for this purpose: oxygen (O2) and nitrous oxide (N2O).

2. Replacing oxygen (O2) with nitrous oxide (N2O) led to a decrease in overall activity but an increase in the selectivity towards propene formation, maintaining the same degree of propane conversion.

3. Insights into the phase composition, reduction, structure, dispersion of vanadium sites, and electronic properties of VOx/-Al2O3 were obtained through characterizations using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TPR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UVVIS-DRS), contact potential difference (CPD), and electrical conductivity measurements.

4. The relationship between catalytic performance and solid-material properties was established, indicating that isolated sites enhance propene selectivity, though they do not completely cover the support surface where propene can be adsorbed and further oxidized to COx.

5. A high selectivity for propene can be achieved by fully covering the support surface with well-dispersed vanadia species.

6. The decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase in propene selectivity were observed due to the less favorable decomposition of nitrous oxide (N2O) over the studied materials compared to oxygen (O2) activation.

2. 用氮氧化物（N2O）代替氧气（O2）导致总体活性降低，但丙烯选择性提高，同时保持相同的丙烷转化率。

3. 通过对X射线衍射（XRD）、热重分析（TPR）、电子顺磁共振（EPR）、紫外可见漫反射光谱（UVVIS-DRS）、接触电位差（CPD）和电导率测量等技术进行材料表征，获得了关于相组成、还原性、结构、钒物种分散性和电子性质的基本见解。

4. 根据表征研究结果，催化性能与固体材料属性之间的关系被建立，表明孤立的位点有利于丙烯选择性，但它们并未完全覆盖支持表面，在该表面上丙烯可以吸附并进一步氧化为COx。

5. 通过全面覆盖支持表面并分散分布的钒物种，可以获得高丙烯选择性。

6. 由于在研究材料中，氮氧化物（N2O）的分解不如氧气（O2）活化有利，因此观察到稳态活性位点浓度下降以及丙烯选择性增加。
