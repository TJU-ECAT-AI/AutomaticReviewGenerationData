[1] "The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials increases with the content of deposited vanadia (Table 1)."
[2] "Since these materials are predominantly n-conductors, the dependence of the conductivity on vanadia loading is attributed to an increase in the concentration of free electrons in the conduction band."
[3] "The characterisation results of the oxidised materials indicate that the degree of polymerisation of vanadia species is a strong function of vanadia loading."
[4] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
[5] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism."
[6] "Replacing gas-phase oxygen by nitrous oxide results in a decrease in the initial rates of products formation at all temperatures studied."
[7] "From the above, it became obvious that catalytic performance of VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic system depends on vanadia loading and the oxidant used."

1. The electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials rises with the quantity of vanadia deposited, attributed to the increase in the concentration of free electrons in the conduction band within these predominantly n-conducting materials.

2. The degree of polymerization of vanadia species is significantly influenced by the vanadia loading according to the characterization outcomes of the oxidized materials.

3. Propane is primarily oxidized to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, whereas propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane over isolated vanadium species.

4. Over vanadiaalumina materials, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) happens via a redox mechanism, as indicated by conductivity and UVVIS data.

5. Replacing oxygen with nitrous oxide leads to a decline in the initial rates of product formation across all studied temperatures.

6. It is evident that the catalytic performance of the VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic system relies on vanadia loading and the oxidant employed.

7. The catalytic efficiency is notably impacted by vanadia distribution and oxidant activation, as demonstrated through changes in the initial rates of product formation and selectivity when oxygen is substituted with nitrous oxide.

1. 当催化材料中沉积的钒含量增加时，电导率也随之提高，这是由于在这些主要为n型导体中的传导带内自由电子浓度的增加所致。

2. 根据氧化材料的表征结果，钒物种的聚合度与钒负载量之间存在显著关系。

3. 在具有聚集体范德华物种的催化材料上，丙烷首先被氧化为丙烯，随后丙烯进一步氧化为COx。而在仅包含孤立范德华物种的催化材料上，丙烯和COx主要直接从丙烷形成。

4. 根据电导率和UVVIS数据，在范德华铝氧化物材料上，丙烷氧化反应（ODP）通过一个氧化还原机制发生。

5. 将氧气替换为硝酸盐导致所有研究温度下初始产物形成速率降低。

6. 催化性能明显依赖于钒的负载量以及所使用的氧化剂，这是通过观察氧被硝酸盐取代时产物形成速率和选择性变化得出的结论。

7. 通过改变氧气为硝酸盐，可以观察到催化效率受到钒分布和氧化剂激活的影响。
