[1] "For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the initial rates of products formation over differently-loaded VOx/-Al2O3 catalytic materials (0.59.5 wt.% of vanadium) were derived from near differential degree of conversion for two different oxidants, i.e. O2 and N2O."
[2] "By replacement of O2 with N2O, overall activity decreased, while the selectivity towards propene formation increased for the same degree of propane conversion."
[3] "The fundamental insights into phase composition,reduction, structure and dispersion of vanadium sites as well as electronic properties of VOx/-Al2O3 were derived from characterisation of the materials by XRD, TPR, EPR, UVVIS diffuse reflectance spectroscopies (UVVIS-DRS), contact potential difference (CPD) and electrical conductivity measurements."
[4] "As a result of the characterisation studies, the following relationships between catalytic performance and solid-material properties were obtained. Isolated sites are beneficial for propene selectivity but they do not completely cover the support surface, on which propene can be adsorbed and further oxidised to COx."
[5] "Since N2O decomposition, over the studied mate- rials, is less favourable than O2 activation, a decrease in the steady-state concentration of active sites and an increase of the propene selectivity is achieved."
[6] "The total electrical conductivity of the catalytic materials increases with the content of deposited vana- dia."
[7] "In agreement with the redox mechanism of the ODP reaction (Eqs. (1) and (2)), a higher concentration of free electrons implies a higher rate of incorporation of gas-phase oxygen into lattice oxygen (the active oxygen species Eq. (2)), which influences the rate of propane activation (Eq. (1))."
[8] "Over catalytic materials with polymeric vanadium species, propane is initially oxidised to propene followed by propene oxidation to COx, while over isolated vanadium species propene and COx products are mainly formed directly from propane."
[9] "Conductivity and UVVIS data show that ODP occurs over vanadiaalumina via a redox mechanism."
[10] "This study has shown that catalytic performance of various VOx/-Al2O3 materials in ODP is strongly affected by the solid-material properties, i.e. reducibil- ity, structure of vanadia species, electronic properties and the ability of the catalyst to reoxidise reduced active sites."

The literature discusses how the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) performance varies with different synthesis methods of VOx/-Al2O3 catalysts. The key factors affecting performance include vanadium content, phase composition, reduction state, electronic properties, and the catalyst's ability to reoxidize reduced active sites. N2O as an oxidant increases propene selectivity while decreasing overall activity compared to O2. Polymeric vanadium species enhance propene selectivity, while isolated vanadium species favor direct propane oxidation. The electrical conductivity correlates with vanadium content, influencing the rate of oxygen incorporation and propane activation. Optimizing these properties is crucial for enhancing ODP performance.

文献讨论了不同合成方法下VOx/-Al2O3催化剂在氧化脱氢反应中的性能变化。关键影响因素包括钒含量、相组成、还原状态、电子性质以及催化剂对还原活性位点的重新氧化能力。与氧气相比，使用N2O作为氧化剂可以提高丙烯选择性，同时降低整体活性。聚态钒物种增加了丙烯选择性，而孤立的钒物种更倾向于直接丙烷氧化。电导率与钒含量相关，影响氧的整合速率和丙烷激活速率。优化这些性质对于增强ODP性能至关重要。
