[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."
[2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed."
[3] "Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."
[4] "The mechanism of such a reduction switches from an inhibition of the oxygen adsorption at low N2O concentrations to a combination of this inhibition effect with a direct reduction of the surface of the catalyst by N2O at high concentrations."
[5] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
[6] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."
[7] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane. But this probably happens only under transitory conditions as N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

The addition of N2O to a feed containing propane and molecular oxygen significantly impacts the catalytic performance of nickel molybdate catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The primary effect is to reduce the oxidation rate of the catalysts, leading to a decrease in their overall oxidation state. This reduction is concentration-dependent; higher N2O concentrations lead to greater catalyst reduction. The reduction mechanism varies depending on the N2O concentration: at low levels, it inhibits oxygen adsorption, while at higher levels, it directly reduces the catalyst surface. Low ppm of N2O cause mild reduction, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a reduction in CO2 formation and oxygen consumption. Increasing N2O concentration deepens the reduction, causing a decline in propane conversion, propylene yield, and selectivity, along with further decreases in CO2 selectivity and oxygen consumption. At high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced from propane, but this likely occurs only temporarily, as N2O requires molecular oxygen to sustainably produce propylene.

在丙烷和分子氧组成的流体中添加N2O，对镍钼酸盐催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中的催化性能产生了重要影响。主要的影响是降低了催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进催化剂的还原。这种还原程度依赖于N2O在流体中的浓度。N2O浓度越高，催化剂的还原程度也越高。还原机制根据N2O浓度的不同而变化：在低浓度时，它抑制了氧气吸附，而在高浓度时，它直接通过N2O还原催化剂表面。低ppm的N2O仅引起轻微的还原，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性增加，并减少了CO2形成和氧气消耗。随着N2O浓度的增加，还原程度加深，导致丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和选择性下降，同时进一步降低了CO2选择性和氧气消耗。在高N2O浓度下，可以利用N2O从丙烷生产丙烯，但这种情况可能只在短暂时间内发生，因为N2O需要分子氧才能持续生产丙烯。
