<p>The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed. Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts.</p>
<p>The mechanism of such a reduction switches from an inhibition of the oxygen adsorption at low N2O concentrations to a combination of this inhibition effect with a direct reduction of the surface of the catalyst by N2O at high concentrations.</p>
<p>Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption.</p>
<p>When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further.</p>
<p>At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane. But this probably happens only under transitory conditions as N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably.</p>

The addition of N2O in the feed of propane and molecular oxygen can significantly affect the catalytic performance of nickel molybdate catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. At low concentrations of N2O, the catalyst's oxidation rate decreases, leading to its reduction. This effect is concentration-dependent, with higher N2O concentrations resulting in greater catalyst reduction. The mechanism involves both inhibiting oxygen adsorption and directly reducing the catalyst surface by N2O at higher concentrations. Small amounts of N2O lead to a mild reduction, decreasing propane conversion while increasing propylene yield and selectivity, and reducing CO2 formation and oxygen consumption. As the N2O concentration increases, the catalyst becomes more deeply reduced, causing a decrease in propane conversion, propylene yield, and selectivity, as well as further reductions in CO2 selectivity and oxygen consumption. At high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced from propane transiently, but this typically requires the presence of molecular oxygen for durable propylene production.

在丙烷和分子氧组成的流体中添加N2O，可以显著影响镍钼酸盐催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯过程中的催化性能。在低N2O浓度下，催化剂的氧化速率降低，从而促进其还原。这种效应依赖于N2O的浓度，浓度越高，催化剂的还原程度越大。机制包括抑制氧气吸附和在高浓度N2O下直接通过N2O对催化剂表面进行还原。少量N2O导致轻微的还原，降低丙烷转化率，同时增加丙烯产率和选择性，并减少二氧化碳形成和氧气消耗。随着N2O浓度的增加，催化剂被更深地还原，导致丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和选择性下降，以及进一步降低二氧化碳选择性和氧气消耗。在高N2O浓度下，仅在短暂条件下，可以通过丙烷产生丙烯，但通常需要存在分子氧才能实现持续的丙烯生产。
