<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The addition of N2O in the reaction feed can significantly impact the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. At low concentrations, N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen, slowing down the oxidation rate and promoting the reduction of the catalyst. As the concentration of N2O increases, the reduction becomes more direct, involving a combination of inhibition and direct reduction by N2O. 

Small amounts of N2O (300 ppm) lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a reduction in CO2 formation, and a decrease in oxygen consumption. With higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%), the reduction is deeper, leading to a decrease in propane conversion, propylene yield, and selectivity, as well as further reductions in oxygen consumption and CO2 selectivity. At very high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced directly from propane, but this typically occurs under transient conditions as N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene continuously.

在反应流中添加N2O可以显著影响镍钼酸催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程。在较低浓度下，N2O抑制氧吸附，减缓氧化速率并促进催化剂的还原。随着N2O浓度的增加，还原变得更加直接，涉及抑制和N2O直接对催化剂表面的还原的组合。

少量N2O（300 ppm）导致催化剂轻微还原，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性增加，CO2形成减少以及氧气消耗降低。当N2O浓度较高（1-10%）时，还原更深，导致丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和选择性下降，以及氧气消耗和CO2选择性的进一步减少。在非常高浓度的N2O下，可以直接从丙烷生产丙烯，但这种情况通常仅在N2O需要分子氧持续产生丙烯的情况下发生。

The addition of N2O to a feed containing propane and molecular oxygen significantly impacts the catalytic performance of nickel molybdate catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The primary effect is to reduce the oxidation rate of the catalysts, leading to a decrease in their overall oxidation state. This reduction is concentration-dependent; higher N2O concentrations lead to greater catalyst reduction. The reduction mechanism varies depending on the N2O concentration: at low levels, it inhibits oxygen adsorption, while at higher levels, it directly reduces the catalyst surface. Low ppm of N2O cause mild reduction, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, and a reduction in CO2 formation and oxygen consumption. Increasing N2O concentration deepens the reduction, causing a decline in propane conversion, propylene yield, and selectivity, along with further decreases in CO2 selectivity and oxygen consumption. At high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced from propane, but this likely occurs only temporarily, as N2O requires molecular oxygen to sustainably produce propylene.

在丙烷和分子氧组成的流体中添加N2O，对镍钼酸盐催化剂在丙烷氧化脱氢为丙烯过程中的催化性能产生了重要影响。主要的影响是降低了催化剂的氧化速率，从而促进催化剂的还原。这种还原程度依赖于N2O在流体中的浓度。N2O浓度越高，催化剂的还原程度也越高。还原机制根据N2O浓度的不同而变化：在低浓度时，它抑制了氧气吸附，而在高浓度时，它直接通过N2O还原催化剂表面。低ppm的N2O仅引起轻微的还原，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性增加，并减少了CO2形成和氧气消耗。随着N2O浓度的增加，还原程度加深，导致丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和选择性下降，同时进一步降低了CO2选择性和氧气消耗。在高N2O浓度下，可以利用N2O从丙烷生产丙烯，但这种情况可能只在短暂时间内发生，因为N2O需要分子氧才能持续生产丙烯。

The addition of N2O in the feed of propane and molecular oxygen can significantly affect the catalytic performance of nickel molybdate catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. At low concentrations of N2O, the catalyst's oxidation rate decreases, leading to its reduction. This effect is concentration-dependent, with higher N2O concentrations resulting in greater catalyst reduction. The mechanism involves both inhibiting oxygen adsorption and directly reducing the catalyst surface by N2O at higher concentrations. Small amounts of N2O lead to a mild reduction, decreasing propane conversion while increasing propylene yield and selectivity, and reducing CO2 formation and oxygen consumption. As the N2O concentration increases, the catalyst becomes more deeply reduced, causing a decrease in propane conversion, propylene yield, and selectivity, as well as further reductions in CO2 selectivity and oxygen consumption. At high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced from propane transiently, but this typically requires the presence of molecular oxygen for durable propylene production.
