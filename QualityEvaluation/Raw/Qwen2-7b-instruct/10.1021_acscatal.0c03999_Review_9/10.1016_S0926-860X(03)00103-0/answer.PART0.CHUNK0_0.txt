<p>The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed. Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts.</p>
<p>The mechanism of such a reduction switches from an inhibition of the oxygen adsorption at low N2O concentrations to a combination of this inhibition effect with a direct reduction of the surface of the catalyst by N2O at high concentrations.</p>
<p>Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption.</p>
<p>When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper. Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further.</p>
<p>At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane. But this probably happens only under transitory conditions as N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably.</p>

The addition of N2O in the reaction feed can significantly impact the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts. At low concentrations, N2O inhibits the adsorption of oxygen, slowing down the oxidation rate and promoting the reduction of the catalyst. As the concentration of N2O increases, the reduction becomes more direct, involving a combination of inhibition and direct reduction by N2O. 

Small amounts of N2O (300 ppm) lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, resulting in a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a reduction in CO2 formation, and a decrease in oxygen consumption. With higher concentrations of N2O (1-10%), the reduction is deeper, leading to a decrease in propane conversion, propylene yield, and selectivity, as well as further reductions in oxygen consumption and CO2 selectivity. At very high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced directly from propane, but this typically occurs under transient conditions as N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene continuously.

在反应流中添加N2O可以显著影响镍钼酸催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢生成丙烯的过程。在较低浓度下，N2O抑制氧吸附，减缓氧化速率并促进催化剂的还原。随着N2O浓度的增加，还原变得更加直接，涉及抑制和N2O直接对催化剂表面的还原的组合。

少量N2O（300 ppm）导致催化剂轻微还原，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性增加，CO2形成减少以及氧气消耗降低。当N2O浓度较高（1-10%）时，还原更深，导致丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和选择性下降，以及氧气消耗和CO2选择性的进一步减少。在非常高浓度的N2O下，可以直接从丙烷生产丙烯，但这种情况通常仅在N2O需要分子氧持续产生丙烯的情况下发生。
