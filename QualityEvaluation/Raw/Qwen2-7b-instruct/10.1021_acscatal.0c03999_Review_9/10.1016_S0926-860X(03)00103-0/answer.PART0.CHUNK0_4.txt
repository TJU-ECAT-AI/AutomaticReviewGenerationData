[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."
[2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction. This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed."
[3] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
[4] "Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."
[5] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The addition of N2O to the feed of propane and molecular oxygen can significantly affect the catalytic performance of nickel molybdate catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
2. N2O contributes to lowering the oxidation rate of the catalysts, leading to their reduction. This effect is contingent upon the concentration of N2O in the feed.
3. An increase in N2O concentration results in a deeper reduction of the catalyst.
4. Consequently, an increase in N2O leads to a decline in propane conversion, propylene yield, and propylene selectivity, along with a reduction in oxygen consumption and CO2 selectivity.
5. At high N2O concentrations, propylene can be produced directly from propane, but this might occur only transiently as N2O requires the presence of molecular oxygen for the sustainable production of propylene.

1. 将N2O添加到丙烷和分子氧的流体中，可以显著影响镍钼酸盐催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯过程中的催化性能。
2. N2O有助于降低催化剂的氧化速率，进而促进其还原。这种效应依赖于N2O在流体中的浓度。
3. N2O浓度的增加导致催化剂的还原程度加深。
4. 相应地，丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和丙烯选择性下降，氧气消耗量和CO2选择性也进一步减少。
5. 在高N2O浓度下，可以直接从丙烷生成丙烯，但这可能仅在短暂条件下发生，因为N2O需要分子氧的存在才能持续生产丙烯。
