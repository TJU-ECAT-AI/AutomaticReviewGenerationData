[1] "The addition of N2O in a feed formed of propane and molecular oxygen could have important implications in the catalytic performances of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts."
[2] "N2O promotes the decrease in the oxidation rate of the catalysts, so promoting its reduction."
[3] "This effect depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed. Higher is the concentration of N2O, higher is the degree of reduction of catalysts."
[4] "Some ppm of N2O only lead to a slight reduction of the catalyst, and bring about a decrease of the conversion of propane, increases of the yield and selectivity in propylene, a decrease of the formation of CO2 and of the oxygen consumption."
[5] "When the amount of N2O increases, the reduction of the catalyst is deeper."
[6] "Correspondingly, the conversion of propane, the yield and the selectivity in propylene decrease, the oxygen consumption and the selectivity to CO2 decrease further."
[7] "At high concentration of N2O propylene is produced from propane. But this probably happens only under transitory conditions as N2O needs the presence of molecular oxygen to produce propylene durably."

1. The addition of N2O in the reaction feed of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on nickel molybdate catalysts has significant implications for catalytic performance. 
2. N2O promotes the reduction of catalysts by decreasing their oxidation rate.
3. The degree of catalyst reduction depends on the concentration of N2O in the feed; higher N2O concentration leads to greater reduction.
4. Low ppm of N2O results in mild catalyst reduction, causing a decrease in propane conversion, an increase in propylene yield and selectivity, a decrease in CO2 formation, and reduced oxygen consumption.
5. Increasing N2O concentration leads to deeper catalyst reduction.
6. As N2O concentration rises, propane conversion, propylene yield, and propylene selectivity decline, and oxygen consumption and CO2 selectivity decrease further.
7. At high N2O concentrations, propylene is produced from propane transiently, requiring the presence of molecular oxygen for durable propylene production.

1.XN2O在丙烷氧化脱氢到丙烯镍钼酸盐催化剂反应中的添加对催化性能具有重要影响。
2.N2O通过降低催化剂的氧化速率来促进催化剂的还原。
3.催化剂的还原程度取决于反应流中N2O的浓度；N2O浓度越高，催化剂还原程度越大。
4.少量ppm的N2O会导致轻微的催化剂还原，导致丙烷转化率下降，丙烯产率和选择性增加，CO2形成减少，氧消耗降低。
5.随着N2O浓度的增加，催化剂的还原程度加深。
6.当N2O浓度升高时，丙烷转化率、丙烯产率和丙烯选择性下降，氧消耗和CO2选择性进一步降低。
7.在高N2O浓度下，仅在短暂条件下从丙烷产生丙烯，需要分子氧持久地产生丙烯。
