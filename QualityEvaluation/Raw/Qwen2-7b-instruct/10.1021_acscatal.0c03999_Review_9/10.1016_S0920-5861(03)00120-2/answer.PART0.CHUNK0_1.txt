<p>Dynamic effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts are reported.</p>
<p>CO2 promotes oxidation probably via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4. Catalysts in presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion.</p>
<p>N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts. The O produced by dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene.</p>
<p>The O produced by dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene. Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.</p>
<p>Both dopes can oxidize the propane to propene.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane leads to dynamic effects that alter the catalyst's performance. 
2. CO2 increases the oxidation state of the catalyst, enhancing conversion rates.
3. N2O improves selectivity by potentially inhibiting O2 adsorption and accelerating catalyst reduction rates.
4. N2O can directly oxidize propane to propene through its dissociation.
5. The use of these gases can be manipulated to adjust the selectivity of the catalytic reaction.
