<p>Dynamic effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts are reported. CO2 promotes oxidation proba- bly via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4. Catalysts in presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion. CO2 is not an inert non-selective product. It can play an active role during the reaction. It could, via O(a): (i) oxidise propane to propene, (ii) increase the oxidation state on the surface of the catalyst and (iii) in high concentration, promote the non-selectivity of the catalyst.</p>
<p>In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts. The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene.</p>

<p>The addition of certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Our suggestion is that the mechanism by which such modification is realised is via the dissociation of both dopes on the surface of the NiMoO4.</p>
<p>It is evident that adding certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Two arguments point to an oxidating role of CO2:</p>

<p>In the presence of N2O, molybdenum works in a more reduced state (Table 3).</p>
<p>N2O can be adsorbed in the same vacancies as O2.</p>
<p>The oxygen species formed by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.</p>
