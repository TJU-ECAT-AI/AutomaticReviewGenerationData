<p>Dynamic effects brought about by the introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts are reported. CO2 promotes oxidation proba- bly via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4. Catalysts in presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion. CO2 is not an inert non-selective product. It can play an active role during the reaction. It could, via O(a): (i) oxidise propane to propene, (ii) increase the oxidation state on the surface of the catalyst and (iii) in high concentration, promote the non-selectivity of the catalyst.</p>
<p>In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts. The Oproduced by dissociation of N2O can oxidise propane to propene.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. CO2 promotes oxidation via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), which increases the conversion of propane to propene. CO2 can play an active role in the reaction, increasing the oxidation state of the catalyst surface. In high concentration, CO2 promotes non-selectivity. 
2. N2O improves selectivity by inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or increasing the reduction rate of the catalysts. The oxygen produced by dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene.

1. CO2通过形成吸附氧物种O(a)来促进氧化，从而增加丙烷转化为丙烯的转化率。CO2可以在反应中发挥积极作用，提高催化剂表面的氧化状态。在高浓度下，CO2促进非选择性。
2. N2O通过抑制氧气的吸附和/或提高催化剂的还原速率来提高选择性。由N2O分解产生的氧可以氧化丙烷生成丙烯。
