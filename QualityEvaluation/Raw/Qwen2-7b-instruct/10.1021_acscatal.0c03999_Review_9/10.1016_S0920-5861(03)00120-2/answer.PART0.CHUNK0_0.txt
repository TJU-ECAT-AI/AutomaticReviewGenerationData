<p>The introduction of small amounts of CO2 and N2O in the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on -NiMoO4 catalysts is reported.</p>
<p>CO2 promotes oxidation probably via the formation of adsorbed oxygen species, O(a), formed by the dissociation of CO2 on NiMoO4.</p>
<p>Catalysts in presence of CO2 work in a high oxidation state increasing conversion. CO2 is not an inert non-selective product. It can play an active role during the reaction.</p>
<p>In presence of N2O, catalytic sites work in a more reduced state. N2O improves selectivity, probably by: (i) inhibiting the adsorption of O2 and/or (ii) increasing reduction rate of the catalysts.</p>
<p>The O produced by dissociation of N2O can oxidize propane to propene.</p>
<p>Adjusting the concentration of promoters could be an useful tool to modulate selectivity during the catalytic reaction.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. CO2 and N2O are introduced into the reaction feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on -NiMoO4 catalysts, affecting the conversion, yield, and selectivity of propene.
2. CO2 promotes oxidation through the formation of adsorbed oxygen species O(a) upon dissociation on NiMoO4, enhancing the catalyst's oxidation state and conversion.
3. CO2 is not just a non-selective product but actively influences the catalyst's performance.
4. N2O reduces the oxidation state of the catalyst, improving selectivity by inhibiting O2 adsorption or increasing the reduction rate.
5. N2O dissociation generates oxygen species capable of oxidizing propane to propene.
6. Modulating the promoter concentration can be beneficial for controlling selectivity during the catalytic reaction.

1. 在氧化脱氢化丙烷过程中，通过在反应物流中添加少量CO2和N2O，在-NiMoO4催化剂上进行，这影响了丙烯的转化、产率和选择性。
2. CO2通过在其表面解离后的CO2形成吸附氧物种O(a)，促进氧化作用，从而提高催化剂的氧化状态和转化率。
3. CO2不仅不是惰性的非选择性产物，而是能够积极地影响催化剂性能。
4. N2O降低催化剂的氧化状态，通过抑制O2吸附或增加还原速率来改善选择性。
5. N2O的解离产生可以氧化丙烷生成丙烯的氧物种。
6. 调节促进剂浓度可以对催化反应期间的选择性控制提供有益工具。
