<p>The addition of certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>

<p>It is evident that adding certain amounts of CO2 or N2O in the feed produces important changes in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Two arguments point to an oxidating role of CO2:</p>
<p>The dissociative adsorption of CO2 to CO and O(a) on Ni catalysts should proceed spontaneously under our conditions of reaction.</p>

<p>N2O can be adsorbed in the same vacancies as O2.</p>
<p>The oxygen species formed by dissociation of N2O has been studied extensively using surface potential measurement on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.</p>

1. The introduction of CO2 and N2O in the feed leads to significant changes in the catalytic activity. 
2. The mechanism of these modifications involves the dissociation of the gases on the surface of NiMoO4.
3. CO2 and N2O induce substantial alterations in the catalyst's performance.
4. Two reasons support the idea that CO2 acts as an oxidant.
5. Under the reaction conditions, the dissociation of CO2 to CO and O(a) on Ni catalysts occurs spontaneously.
6. In the presence of N2O, molybdenum tends to exist in a reduced state.
7. N2O competes with O2 for adsorption sites on the catalyst's surface.
8. The nature of the oxygen species generated by N2O's dissociation has been extensively investigated through surface potential measurements on MoO3/SiO2 catalysts.
