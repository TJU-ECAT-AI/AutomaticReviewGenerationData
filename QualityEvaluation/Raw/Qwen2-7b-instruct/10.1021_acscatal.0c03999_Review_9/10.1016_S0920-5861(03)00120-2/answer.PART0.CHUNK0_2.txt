<p>The addition of gas promoters is already used in some industrial applications. Gaseous dopes added to the reactant feed of a reactor could improve activity and selectivity and inhibit non-desirable reactions and deactivation.</p>
<p>A better understanding of the mechanistic processes in presence of dopes is then a key to understanding the real state of the catalysts during the reaction, and to improve selectivity.</p>
<p>The dissociation of both dopes on the surface of the catalyst have to be taken into account to explain the catalytic performances in their presence.</p>
<p>Both dopes can oxidise the propane to propene.</p>

1. Gas promoters, like CO2 and N2O, are utilized in industrial applications to enhance activity and selectivity, prevent unwanted reactions, and mitigate catalyst deactivation.
2. A comprehensive grasp of the reaction dynamics involving dopants is essential for elucidating the catalyst's actual condition during the process and enhancing selectivity.
3. The interaction of both dopants on the catalyst surface needs to be considered to explain their impact on catalytic performance.
4. CO2 and N2O are capable of oxidizing propane into propene.
