1. The ODHP reaction demonstrates optimal propylene yields when the N2O/propane ratio is at equilibrium, specifically at a 1:1 ratio.
2. Nano-sized Fe-BEA catalysts outperform micro-sized ones in terms of C3H6 yield at higher temperatures.
3. Incorporating a minor oxygen stream into the reaction mixture enhances the conversion rates of N2O and propane, albeit at the cost of reduced propylene selectivity and increased CO2 formation.
4. Reactivation through oxidation pulses exhibits full reversibility of the catalyst, indicating that a 10-minute pulse is sufficient to restore the active sites.

1. 在N2O与丙烷比例为1:1的平衡浓度下，ODHP反应可产生最佳的丙烯产率。
2. 纳米级Fe-BEA催化剂在高温条件下相较于微米级催化剂，在C3H6产率方面表现更优。
3. 将微量氧气引入反应混合物中，可以提高N2O和丙烷的转化率，但会降低丙烯的选择性和增加二氧化碳的形成。
4. 通过氧化脉冲重新激活催化剂显示出完全可逆性，表明10分钟的脉冲足以恢复活性位点。
