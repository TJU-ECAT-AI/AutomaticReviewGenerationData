"Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by N2O over Fe-BEA catalysts represents a potential process for simultaneous functionalization of propane and utilization of N2O waste as an environmentally harmful gas."
"The assumed structure of highly active Fe-species is presented by iron ions balanced by negative framework charge, mostly populated at low Fe loadings."
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the synthesis and application of nano-scale zeolites."
"Zeolites with a crystal size smaller than 100 nm are the potential replacement for existing zeolite catalysts and can be used in novel environmentally benign catalytic processes."
"Effect of the N2O concentration has been analyzed under reaction regimes RS-1 and RS-2."
"Use of the N2O alone (RS-1) induce a rapid decrease in the propylene yield, together with decrease of the propane and N2O conversions."
"Results obtained under such dynamic conditions, combining 10 minutes production and regeneration periods, show effective stabilization of the propylene yields under such process conditions."
"Thus Figure 2. ODHP vs. time on stream over Fe/m-BEA"
"Thus Figure 1. ODHP: propylene yields against temperature"
"Thus Figure 3, gives the propylene yields with periodic elimination of carbon species during 5 or 10 min O2 pulses."
"Similar catalytic activity profiles under cyclic reaction-regeneration reveals that deactivation of the Fe-BEA catalysts is fully reversible under such conditions."

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, can influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. For instance, the catalytic performance of the Fe-BEA catalysts in the temperature range of 250-550°C shows that the particle size of the parent BEA zeolite significantly affects the propylene yield. Increasing the N2O concentration results in higher N2O conversion but decreases the selectivity towards propylene. The nano-sized catalysts exhibit superior propylene formation compared to micro-sized ones, especially at higher temperatures. The addition of a small amount of oxygen stream to the reaction mixture increases the conversions of N2O and propane but decreases the propylene selectivity and CO2 formation. Reactivation of the catalysts by oxidation pulses proves to be fully reversible, with 10-minute pulses being sufficient to regenerate the active sites, thus achieving a stable propylene yield under cyclic reaction-regeneration processes.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，可以影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标展示了在不同反应条件下催化剂的有效性。例如，在250-550°C的温度范围内，不同粒度的BEA沸石母体对丙烯产率有显著影响。增加N2O浓度可提高N2O转化率，但降低丙烯选择性。纳米尺寸的催化剂在高温下表现出更好的丙烷产率与微米尺寸的催化剂相比。向反应混合物中添加少量氧气流提高了N2O和丙烷的转化率，但降低了丙烯选择性和CO2形成。通过氧化脉冲重新激活催化剂证明是完全可逆的，10分钟的脉冲足以再生活性位点，从而在循环反应再生过程中实现稳定的丙烷产率。
