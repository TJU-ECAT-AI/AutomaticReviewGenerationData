"Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by N2O over Fe-BEA catalysts represents a potential process for simultaneous functionalization of propane and utilization of N2O waste as an environmentally harmful gas."
"The assumed structure of highly active Fe-species is presented by iron ions balanced by negative framework charge, mostly populated at low Fe loadings."
"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the synthesis and application of nano-scale zeolites."
"Zeolites with a crystal size smaller than 100 nm are the potential replacement for existing zeolite catalysts and can be used in novel environmentally benign catalytic processes."
"Effect of the N2O concentration has been analyzed under reaction regimes RS-1 and RS-2."
"Use of the N2O alone (RS-1) induce a rapid decrease in the propylene yield, together with decrease of the propane and N2O conversions."
"Results obtained under such dynamic conditions, combining 10 minutes production and regeneration periods, show effective stabilization of the propylene yields under such process conditions."
"Thus Figure 2. ODHP vs. time on stream over Fe/m-BEA"
"Thus Figure 1. ODHP: propylene yields against temperature"
"Thus Figure 3, gives the propylene yields with periodic elimination of carbon species during 5 or 10 min O2 pulses."
"Similar catalytic activity profiles under cyclic reaction-regeneration reveals that deactivation of the Fe-BEA catalysts is fully reversible under such conditions."

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, can influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. For instance, the catalytic performance of the Fe-BEA catalysts in the temperature range of 250-550°C shows that the particle size of the parent BEA zeolite significantly affects the propylene yield. Increasing the N2O concentration results in higher N2O conversion but decreases the selectivity towards propylene. The nano-sized catalysts exhibit superior propylene formation compared to micro-sized ones, especially at higher temperatures. The addition of a small amount of oxygen stream to the reaction mixture increases the conversions of N2O and propane but decreases the propylene selectivity and CO2 formation. Reactivation of the catalysts by oxidation pulses proves to be fully reversible, with 10-minute pulses being sufficient to regenerate the active sites, thus achieving a stable propylene yield under cyclic reaction-regeneration processes.

2.2. Catalytic activity tests
Catalytic experiments were carried out using plug flow fixed bed micro reactor. The micro reactor was loaded with 50 mg of catalyst (sieve 0.6-0.3 mm) placed between two plugs of quartz wool. Prior to catalytic experiment, a catalyst was pretreated in a flow of He and oxygen stream at 550 C for 1 h and then cooled to reaction temperature in a flow of pure He, after stabilization of the reaction temperature. He stream was then replaced by a reaction mixture. The ODHP was investigated using feeds containing 1.5 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-1), 3 vol % N2O, 1.5 vol % C3H8 (regime RS-2),or 1.5 vol % N2O and 1.5 vol % C3H8, 0.2 vol % O2 (regime RS-3). In all catalytic experiments the GHSV was maintained at 60,000 h1. The regeneration procedure consisted of 10 or 5 min pulses of O2 at GHSV 30,000 h-1 in each run. The evolution of ODHP with time-on-stream has been followed at 400 C. In a typical experiment the feed reactant stream of constant composition was maintained over the catalysts for 2 h, whereas in reaction-regeneration experiments, the feed mixture was replaced after 10 min of the reaction by oxygen pulses.
The product mixture was analyzed with on-line connected gas chromatograph using mol sieve and HP-PLOT Q capillary column to separate permanent gases followed by detection with TCD; saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons were separated using PLOT Q and DB-VRX capillary columns and detected by FID.
3.1. Performance of ODHP without regeneration
Figures 1 shows the catalytic performance of the Fe-BEA catalysts in the temperature range of 250-550 C. It is clear from the figure that propylene yield depends on particle size of the parent BEA zeolite. Effect of the N2O concentration has been analyzed under reaction regimes RS-1 and RS-2. Increase in N2O concentration resulted in the same propene yields but increased the N2O conversion and decreased the selectivity toward propylene. At higher temperature has been obtained increases in the formation of the molecular oxygen which further accelerates production of the undesired carbon oxides.
Thus, at lower feed concentration of N2O, i.e. at 1:1 feed ratio of reactants (RS-1),formation of carbon oxides is suppressed and the selectivity of ODHP reaction is higher. With both reaction streams increase of temperature would provide decrease in propylene selectivity due to total oxidation of propane to carbon oxides. Nevertheless,comparison of the performance of the catalysts with different particle sizes shown clearly that at higher temperatures the Fe-BEA with nano crystal size display improved catalytic activity as well as propylene yields (see Fig. 1). Increase in the propylene yield indicated over nano-BEA could be probably attributed to the enhancement of the mass transfer of the product in the zeolite porous structure or better utilization of the zeolite channels by the reactant molecules. Thus use of nano-zeolites increases the selectivity of the desired product due to easier desorption of product molecule from the local environment of zeolite channels which prevents pore blocking and over-oxidation.
Figure 2 illustrate the changes in propylene yield with time using pure N2O or N2O/O2 mixture. Use of the N2O alone (RS-1) induce a rapid decrease in the propylene yield,together with decrease of the propane and N2O conversions, probably due to formation of carbonaceous deposits. Experiment under mixed N2O/O2 stream (regime RS-3) shown that presence of a small amount of oxygen does not prevent deactivation of the catalyst but indicate some stabilization of the propylene yields after longer time periods.
3.2. ODHP performance under cyclic reaction-regeneration
Reaction-regeneration studies were carried out with the aim to stabilize the propylene yield for longer periods and prevent the catalyst deactivation. Regeneration of the catalyst was analyzed using a repeated reaction-regeneration periods, with O2 pulse with different time intervals after production periods. Figure 3, gives the propylene yields with periodic elimination of carbon species during 5 or 10 min O2 pulses. Results obtained under such dynamic conditions, combining 10 minutes production and regeneration periods, show effective stabilization of the propylene yields under such process conditions. Using shorter regeneration periods of 5 min would provide a gradual decrease in propylene yield. The complete reaction profile of cyclic reaction- regeneration with 10 min O2 pulse (see Figure 4), evidence stabilization of the catalytic active sites and suppression of the coke formation at 400 C under ODHP reaction.

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, specifically steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by influencing their ability to efficiently convert propane to propylene while minimizing the formation of carbon oxides. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. C3H8 conversion - The efficiency of propane conversion to propylene.
2. N2O conversion - The extent to which N2O is converted during the reaction.
3. C3H6 selectivity - The ratio of propylene produced to the total hydrocarbons formed.
4. C3H6 yield - The amount of propylene produced per unit of input propane.

Steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange alter the surface properties and acidity of the zeolites, affecting their reactivity and stability. Nano-sized zeolites exhibit superior propylene formation compared to micro-sized ones at higher temperatures, suggesting enhanced mass transfer and reactant molecule utilization within the zeolite channels. The addition of a small amount of oxygen stream increases the conversions of both N2O and propane but negatively impacts propylene selectivity, promoting the formation of carbon dioxide. Repeated reaction-regeneration cycles using short oxidation pulses effectively stabilize the catalytic active sites, preventing catalyst deactivation and maintaining high propylene yields over prolonged periods.

铁含量的ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换，通过改变其表面特性和酸性，影响它们在N2O辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标显示了在不同反应条件下它们的有效性：

1. C3H8转化率 - 丙烷转化为丙烯的效率。
2. N2O转化率 - 反应过程中N2O的转化程度。
3. C3H6选择性 - 生成的丙烯与总烃形成的比率。
4. C3H6产量 - 每单位输入丙烷产生的丙烯量。

蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换改变了沸石的表面特性和酸性，影响其活性和稳定性。纳米级沸石在高温下比微米级沸石表现出更好的丙烯形成能力，这表明在沸石通道中增强的质量传递和反应分子利用。纳米级沸石在高温下展现出优于微米级沸石的丙烯生成能力，这可能归因于产物分子从沸石通道局部环境更易脱附，防止孔堵塞和过氧化。少量氧气流的添加增加了N2O和丙烷的转化，但降低了丙烯选择性，促进了二氧化碳的形成。重复反应再生周期使用较短的氧化脉冲有效地稳定了催化活性位点，防止催化剂失活并维持高丙烯产率较长的时间。
