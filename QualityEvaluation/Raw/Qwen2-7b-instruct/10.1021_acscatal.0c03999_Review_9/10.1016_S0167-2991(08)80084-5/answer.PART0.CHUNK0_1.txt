The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The document indicates that the equimolar ratio of reactants minimizes the formation of carbon oxides and optimizes the propylene selectivity. Moreover, reactivation of the catalysts by oxidation pulses proves the full reversibility of the catalyst, with 10-minute pulses being sufficient to regenerate the active sites.
