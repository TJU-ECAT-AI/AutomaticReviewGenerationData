The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, specifically steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction by influencing their ability to efficiently convert propane to propylene while minimizing the formation of carbon oxides. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. C3H8 conversion - The efficiency of propane conversion to propylene.
2. N2O conversion - The extent to which N2O is converted during the reaction.
3. C3H6 selectivity - The ratio of propylene produced to the total hydrocarbons formed.
4. C3H6 yield - The amount of propylene produced per unit of input propane.

Steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange alter the surface properties and acidity of the zeolites, affecting their reactivity and stability. Nano-sized zeolites exhibit superior propylene formation compared to micro-sized ones at higher temperatures, suggesting enhanced mass transfer and reactant molecule utilization within the zeolite channels. The addition of a small amount of oxygen stream increases the conversions of both N2O and propane but negatively impacts propylene selectivity, promoting the formation of carbon dioxide. Repeated reaction-regeneration cycles using short oxidation pulses effectively stabilize the catalytic active sites, preventing catalyst deactivation and maintaining high propylene yields over prolonged periods.

铁含量的ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换，通过改变其表面特性和酸性，影响它们在N2O辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标显示了在不同反应条件下它们的有效性：

1. C3H8转化率 - 丙烷转化为丙烯的效率。
2. N2O转化率 - 反应过程中N2O的转化程度。
3. C3H6选择性 - 生成的丙烯与总烃形成的比率。
4. C3H6产量 - 每单位输入丙烷产生的丙烯量。

蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换改变了沸石的表面特性和酸性，影响其活性和稳定性。纳米级沸石在高温下比微米级沸石表现出更好的丙烯形成能力，这表明在沸石通道中增强的质量传递和反应分子利用。纳米级沸石在高温下展现出优于微米级沸石的丙烯生成能力，这可能归因于产物分子从沸石通道局部环境更易脱附，防止孔堵塞和过氧化。少量氧气流的添加增加了N2O和丙烷的转化，但降低了丙烯选择性，促进了二氧化碳的形成。重复反应再生周期使用较短的氧化脉冲有效地稳定了催化活性位点，防止催化剂失活并维持高丙烯产率较长的时间。
