[1] "The values of k decrease in the order C H rel 3 8 )C H )CH fH fC H , benzene being 2 6 4 2 6 6 found to be as reactive as CH and H ."
[2] "A remarkable feature of CH C H N O 4 6 6 2 conversion over HZSM-5 is the absence of deep oxidation products CO , CO and enhanced amount of toluene Tol , xylenes Xy , cresols Cre , and diphenylmethane DPhM."
[3] "The shift of molecular ions in the mass-spectra of Tol mrzs92, . . . and DPhM mrzs168 corresponds to the presence of only one 13C atom in the molecules."
[4] "Neither mass-spectroscopy or 13C NMR data have shown any insertion of carbon label in the aromatic ring of phenol."
[5] "Therefore, for CH C H N O feed,4 6 6 2 the main reaction route for Tol and Xy formation is the oxidative methylation of aromatic ring with methane."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the oxidative conversions on HZSM-5 in the presence of N2O correlates with the strength of C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, leading to the formation of toluene and xylenes.

1. 烷烃在N2O辅助下的氧化转化中，在HZSM-5的存在下，其反应活性与C-H键的强度相关。甲烷能够使苯环的芳环甲基化，从而形成对二甲苯和间二甲苯。
