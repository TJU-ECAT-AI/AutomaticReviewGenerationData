Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol from benzene is about 85-95% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst.

The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions 1,2 k sk rk can be used as a relative reactivity of hydrocarbons and this ratio can be calculated from Eq. 3 for the conversion of binary hydrocarbon feed RH:CH:O:N:He 3.4 2 kCH4 CH products 1.4 2 kRH RHproducts,2 where RHsC H, C H, H or C H.

A remarkable feature of CH4 C6H6 N Oconversion over HZSM-5 is the absence of deep oxidation products CO, COand enhanced amount of toluene Tol, xylenes Xy, cresols Cre, and diphenylmethane DPhM.

For CH4 C6H6 N Ofeed, the main reaction route for Tol and Xy formation is the oxidative methylation of aromatic ring with methane.

The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the oxidative conversions on HZSM-5 in the presence of N2O correlates with the strength of C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, leading to the formation of toluene and xylenes.
