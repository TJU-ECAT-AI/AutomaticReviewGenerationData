1. In the presence of N2O on HZSM-5, the reactivity of hydrocarbons correlates with the strength of C-H bond. Methane is capable of alkylating the aromatic ring of benzene, producing toluene and xylenes.

2. The conversion of methane, ethane, propane, benzene, hydrogen, and their mixtures in the presence of N2O on HZSM-5 results in the formation of toluene, xylenes, cresols, and diphenylmethane without significant deep oxidation products like CO, CO2.

3. When 13CH4, C6H6, N2O, and He are fed into the system, the mass spectra of toluene, xylenes, and diphenylmethane indicate the presence of only one 13C atom in these molecules.

4. The mass-spectroscopy or 13C NMR data do not show any carbon label insertion into the aromatic ring of phenol during the conversion process.

2. 使用N2O在HZSM-5上的甲烷、乙烷、丙烷、苯、氢气以及它们的混合物的转化过程产生了对二甲苯、间二甲苯、酚以及二苯甲烷，没有显著的深氧化产物如CO、CO2。

[1] "Under experimental conditions studied, the selectivity of formation of ethylene from ethane as well as propylene from propane and phenol from benzene is about 85-95% at conversion up to 10% and remains constant with the time though the activity decreases rapidly because of deactivation of the catalyst."

1. Under the experimental conditions, the selectivity for the formation of ethylene from ethane, propylene from propane, and phenol from benzene ranges from 85% to 95%. This selectivity remains stable over time, despite a rapid decrease in catalyst activity due to deactivation.

2. The relative reactivity of hydrocarbons can be determined by the ratio of kinetic constants of reactions 1,2 k sk rk. This ratio can be calculated using Equation 3 for the conversion of a binary hydrocarbon feed, RH:CH: N O:He.

3. In the conversion of CH C H N O over HZSM-5, there is no formation of deep oxidation products such as CO and CO, and there is an increased production of toluene (Tol), xylenes (Xy), cresols (Cre), and diphenylmethane (DPhM).

4. For the feed consisting of CH C H N O, the primary reaction pathway for the formation of toluene (Tol) and xylenes (Xy) involves the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane.

5. Benzene tends to intercept the surface species formed from methane and a-oxygen, leading to their conversion into CO when the feed contains CH N O.

1. 在实验条件下，从乙烷生成乙烯、丙烷生成丙烯以及苯生成苯酚的选择性在10%转化率下大约为85%-95%，且随着时间保持稳定，尽管催化剂活性因失活而迅速下降。

2. 可以通过反应1、2的速率常数比k sk rk来确定烃类的相对反应性。这个比率可以通过计算等式3中的二元烃流体转化得到RH:CH: N O:He。

3. 在使用HZSM-5催化CH C H N O转化时，没有产生深氧化产物如CO和CO，并且增加了对甲基苯（Tol）、间二甲苯（Xy）、邻二甲苯（Cre）和二苯基甲烷（DPhM）的产量。

4. 对于由CH C H N O组成的流体，形成对甲基苯（Tol）和间二甲苯（Xy）的主要反应途径是通过甲烷进行芳香环的氧化甲基化。

5. 苯倾向于拦截由甲烷和a-氧形成的表面物种，导致它们在CH N O流体存在时转化为CO。

The main reaction route for toluene and xylenes formation is the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane. Indene and naphthalene formation involves a reaction sequence that leads to the consumption of benzene, and the number of labeled carbon atoms in their molecules is less than expected based on the reaction equation.
