The reactivity of hydrocarbons in the oxidative conversions on HZSM-5 in the presence of N2O correlates with the strength of C-H bond. Methane is able to alkylate the aromatic ring of benzene, leading to the formation of toluene and xylenes. The ratio of kinetic constants of reactions 1,2 k sk rk can be used as a relative reactivity of hydrocarbons. Benzene is found to be as reactive as CH and H in the conversion process. The main reaction route for toluene and xylenes formation is the oxidative methylation of the aromatic ring with methane. Indene and naphthalene formation involves a reaction sequence that leads to the consumption of benzene, and the number of labeled carbon atoms in their molecules is less than expected based on the reaction equation.

在HZSM-5的氧化转换过程中，氢碳键的强度决定了不同烃类的反应活性。甲烷能够使苯环上的芳环甲基化，产生对二甲苯和间二甲苯。反应速率常数比k1,2 k sk rk可以作为烃类相对活性的指标。苯被发现与CH和H具有相同的反应活性。主要的反应途径是甲烷通过氧化甲基化作用于芳香环来形成对二甲苯和间二甲苯。吲哚和萘的生成涉及到一个反应序列，该过程消耗了苯，并且它们分子中的碳标记原子数量少于理论预期，基于反应方程式3 CH qC-H q O C-H Ind qH O。
