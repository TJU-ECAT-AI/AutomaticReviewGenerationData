[1] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5, containing a large fraction of iron as oligonuclear FexOy clusters, is more active and selective in ODHP and direct N2O decomposition than steam-activated Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron species predominate."
[2] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."
[3] "The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 for direct N2O decomposition is related to the easier recombination of atomic oxygen species (rate-determining step) over oligonuclear iron clusters, which is a difficult step over isolated ions."

1. Steam-activated FeZSM-5, characterized by a significant portion of iron in the form of oligonuclear FexOy clusters, exhibits superior catalytic activity and selectivity in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and direct N2O decomposition, compared to Fe-silicalite, which predominantly features isolated iron species.

2. Ex-FeZSM-5 demonstrates enhanced performance (both in terms of activity and selectivity) in the conversion of propane with N2O, as well as greater resilience against deactivation caused by coke formation, relative to ex-Fe-silicalite.

3. The increased efficiency of ex-FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is attributed to the more facile recombination of atomic oxygen species, a rate-limiting step, over oligonuclear iron clusters, as opposed to isolated iron ions.

1.X蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5，其中铁的主要形式为FexOy簇，表现出比Fe硅酸盐更高的ODHP活性和选择性，以及直接N2O分解，而后者主要由孤立的铁物种占据。与Fe硅酸盐相比，FeZSM-5具有显著优势。

2. 在N2O辅助下，ex-FeZSM-5在丙烷转化和丙烯选择性方面表现出优越的性能，同时具备更强的抗结焦能力，这与ex-Fe-silicalite形成鲜明对比。

3. ex-FeZSM-5在直接N2O分解中的更高效率归因于在寡核铁簇上更容易进行原子氧物种的再组合，这是相对于孤立的铁离子更为容易的步骤。
