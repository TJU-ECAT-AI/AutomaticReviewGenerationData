[1] "The effect of the iron distribution in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite on their catalytic performance for direct N2O decomposition and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O and O2 was investigated by means of steady-state and transient pulse experiments."
[2] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5, containing a large fraction of iron as oligonuclear FexOy clusters, is more active and selective in ODHP and direct N2O decomposition than steam-activated Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron species predominate."
[3] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."
[4] "The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 for direct N2O decomposition is related to the easier recombination of atomic oxygen species (rate-determining step) over oligonuclear iron clusters, which is a difficult step over isolated ions."
[5] "Active oxygen species deposited over iron centers in FeMFI zeolites upon N2O activation possess a certain lifetime under vacuum conditions. A fraction of these reactive species transforms into other non-reactive oxygen species."

1. The catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized through various methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange is influenced in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolites, characterized by a large fraction of iron in oligonuclear FexOy clusters, exhibit higher activity and selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite with isolated iron species.

2. Under different reaction conditions, steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolites demonstrate superior performance in the oxidative conversion of propane with N2O, showing higher resistance to deactivation by coking compared to Fe-silicalite. 

3. The enhanced catalytic activity of steam-activated FeZSM-5 in direct N2O decomposition is attributed to the easier recombination of atomic oxygen species over oligonuclear iron clusters, a process that is more challenging over isolated iron ions.

4. Active oxygen species deposited over iron centers in FeMFI zeolites upon N2O activation have a specific lifetime under vacuum conditions. A portion of these reactive species transforms into other non-reactive oxygen species, which affects the catalytic performance.

1. 对于在不同方法（如蒸汽处理、固体状态离子交换和液体交换）合成的铁含量ZSM-5沸石，在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能受到影响。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。经过蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石，其特征为大量铁以FexOy簇形式存在，显示出与仅含有孤立铁物种的Fe硅酸盐相比更高的活性和选择性。

2. 在不同的反应条件下，经过蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石在丙烷与N2O的氧化转换中表现出优越的性能，并且比Fe硅酸盐具有更高的抗结焦能力。

3. FeZSM-5沸石在直接N2O分解中的增强催化活性归因于在寡核铁簇上更容易的原子氧物种重组过程，这是一个在孤立铁离子上更困难的过程。

4. FeMFI沸石上由N2O激活沉积的活性氧物种在真空条件下具有特定的寿命。这些活性氧物种的一部分转化为其他非活性氧物种，这影响了催化性能。
