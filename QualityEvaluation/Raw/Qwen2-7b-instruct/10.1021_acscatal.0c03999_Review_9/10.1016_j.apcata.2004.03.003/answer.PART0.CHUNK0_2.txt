[1] "The effect of the iron distribution in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite on their catalytic performance for direct N2O decomposition and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O and O2 was investigated by means of steady-state and transient pulse experiments."
[2] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5, containing a large fraction of iron as oligonuclear FexOy clusters, is more active and selective in ODHP and direct N2O decomposition than steam-activated Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron species predominate."
[3] "The higher activity of steam-activated FeZSM-5 is associated to the higher mobility of atomic oxygen species attached to oligonuclear iron species, which lead to a faster oxygen desorption in direct N2O decomposition as well as to a faster transfer to propane in the ODHP reaction."
[4] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites were found to be highly effective catalysts for ODHP with N2O, with initial propene yields up to 24%."
[5] "Relatively high yields of propionaldehyde are also obtained, which mainly originates from the selective oxidation of propene."
[6] "The unique ODHP performance of iron zeolites requires the use of N2O as monooxygen donor."
[7] "Only a fraction of oxygen species deposited over iron sites of FeMFI upon N2O activation was found to be active towards propane oxidation under transient vacuum conditions."
[8] "This is explained by a fast transformation of short-living highly reactive atomic oxygen species into less reactive ones."
[9] "Initial propene yields over ex-FeZSM-5 (22 and 5.5%, respectively) were also superior compared to ex-Fe-silicalite (16.5 and 3.6%, respectively)."

1. The iron distribution in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite affects their catalytic performance in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) and direct N2O decomposition. Steam-activated FeZSM-5, with a high fraction of iron in oligonuclear clusters, shows greater activity and selectivity in ODHP and N2O decomposition compared to Fe-silicalite with isolated iron species.

2. The enhanced activity of steam-activated FeZSM-5 is attributed to the mobility of atomic oxygen species attached to oligonuclear iron clusters, which facilitates faster oxygen desorption in direct N2O decomposition and quicker transfer to propane in the ODHP reaction.

3. Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly effective catalysts for ODHP with N2O, achieving initial propene yields up to 24%.

4. High yields of propionaldehyde are obtained, primarily due to the selective oxidation of propene.

5. N2O is uniquely effective as a monooxygen donor in the selective oxidations, demonstrating the capability of specific iron species in the zeolites to coordinate reactive atomic oxygen species.

6. The selectivity-conversion relationship for propene and propionaldehyde formation during ODHP with N2O over iron zeolite catalysts is presented in Figure 5.

1. 针对蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5和Fe硅酸盐，铁分布对其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应和直接N2O分解的催化性能有影响。含有大量铁原子簇的蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5，在ODHP和N2O分解方面比以孤立铁物种为主的Fe硅酸盐表现出更高的活性和选择性。

2. 蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5的增强活性归因于附着在寡核铁簇上的原子氧物种的流动性，这促进了直接N2O分解中的快速氧释放以及在ODHP反应中向丙烷的快速转移。

3. 蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石是N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢的有效催化剂，初始丙烯产率可达24%。

4. 高量的丙酮醛也得到产生，主要来源于丙烯的选择性氧化。

5. N2O作为单个氧供体在选择性氧化中具有独特的能力，表明特定的铁物种在沸石中的能力协调活性原子氧物种。

6. 丙烯和丙酮醛形成期间N2O辅助下的铁沸石催化剂的选择性-转化关系在图5中给出。
