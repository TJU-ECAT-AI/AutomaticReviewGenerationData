[1] "Details on the hydrothermal synthesis of FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite have been described elsewhere [12,13,15]."
[2] "The as-synthesized samples, containing the different metals in the zeolite framework, were calcined in air at 823 K for 10 h and converted into the H-form by three consecutive exchanges with a NH4NO3 solution (0.1 M) for 12 h and subsequent air calcination at 823 K for 5 h."
[3] "Finally the catalysts were activated in a flow of nitrogen and steam at ambient pressure, using a partial steam pressure of 300 mbar and 30 ml STP N2 min−1 at 873 K for 5 h."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including hydrothermal synthesis, calcination, and activation in a flow of nitrogen and steam, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include the conversion of propane (C3H8), N2O, the selectivity for propene (C3H6), and the yield of propionaldehyde (C3H6). 

The steam activation method leads to a higher catalytic activity and selectivity for the ODHP reaction compared to the Fe-silicalite catalyst. This is attributed to the presence of oligonuclear iron species in the zeolite pores, which enhances the mobility of atomic oxygen species attached to the iron centers, facilitating faster oxygen desorption and transfer to propane.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括水热合成、煅烧和氮气与蒸汽流下的激活，影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。关键性能指标，如丙烷（C3H8）转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯（C3H6）选择性和丙醇醛（C3H6）产率，显示了不同反应条件下的有效性。

蒸汽活化方法导致ODHP反应的催化活性和选择性高于Fe-硅酸盐催化剂。这是由于沸石孔中的寡核铁物种的存在，增强了附着在铁中心的原子氧物种的移动性，促进了更快的氧释放和向丙烷的转移。

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 shows higher activity and selectivity in ODHP and direct N2O decomposition compared to steam-activated Fe-silicalite. The catalytic performance is determined by the nature and distribution of iron species, especially the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters in FeZSM-5, which facilitates the reaction.

2. Key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these zeolites under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 has higher C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield compared to steam-activated Fe-silicalite in ODHP with N2O. This indicates that the iron distribution and clustering in FeZSM-5 improve the catalytic performance for propane oxidative functionalization.

3. The higher activity of FeZSM-5 for direct N2O decomposition is related to the easier recombination of atomic oxygen species, which is a rate-determining step. This is because oligonuclear iron clusters in FeZSM-5 allow for faster recombination compared to isolated iron ions in Fe-silicalite. The difference in the ease of oxygen recombination affects the efficiency of N2O decomposition and, consequently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 铁基ZSM-5分子筛通过蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换等合成方法，其在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化性能受到影响。与Fe-硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化后的FeZSM-5在直接N2O分解和与N2O和O2的丙烷氧化脱氢中表现出更高的活性和选择性。催化性能取决于铁物种的性质和分布，尤其是FeZSM-5中存在寡核FexOy簇，这促进了反应。

2. 衡量这些分子筛在不同反应条件下的有效性的关键指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。与Fe-硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化后的FeZSM-5在N2O作用下的C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率更高。这表明FeZSM-5中铁分布和聚集体的存在提高了丙烷氧化功能化的催化性能。

3. FeZSM-5在直接N2O分解中的较高活性归因于原子氧物种的更易于重组，这是决定步骤。这是因为FeZSM-5中的寡核铁簇允许更快的重组，与Fe-硅酸盐中孤立的铁离子相比。重组氧气的不同效率影响N2O分解的效率，进而影响丙烷的氧化脱氢。
