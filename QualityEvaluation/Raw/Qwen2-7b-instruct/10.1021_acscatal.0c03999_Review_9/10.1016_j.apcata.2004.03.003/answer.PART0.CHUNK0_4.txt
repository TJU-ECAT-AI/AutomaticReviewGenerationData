[1] "The effect of the iron distribution in steam-activated FeZSM-5 and Fe-silicalite on their catalytic performance for direct N2O decomposition and for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) with N2O and O2 was investigated by means of steady-state and transient pulse experiments."
[2] "Steam-activated FeZSM-5, containing a large fraction of iron as oligonuclear FexOy clusters, is more active and selective in ODHP and direct N2O decomposition than steam-activated Fe-silicalite, where isolated iron species predominate."
[3] "Compared to ex-Fe-silicalite, ex-FeZSM-5 shows a superior performance (activity and selectivity) in the oxidative conversion of C3H8 with N2O, as well as a higher resistance to deactivation by coking."
[4] "The nature and distribution of iron species determines the catalytic performance of the steam-activated iron zeolites."
[5] "The higher activity of ex-FeZSM-5 for direct N2O decomposition is related to the easier recombination of atomic oxygen species (rate-determining step) over oligonuclear iron clusters, which is a difficult step over isolated ions."

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 shows higher activity and selectivity in ODHP and direct N2O decomposition compared to steam-activated Fe-silicalite. The catalytic performance is determined by the nature and distribution of iron species, especially the presence of oligonuclear FexOy clusters in FeZSM-5, which facilitates the reaction.

2. Key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these zeolites under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 has higher C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield compared to steam-activated Fe-silicalite in ODHP with N2O. This indicates that the iron distribution and clustering in FeZSM-5 improve the catalytic performance for propane oxidative functionalization.

3. The higher activity of FeZSM-5 for direct N2O decomposition is related to the easier recombination of atomic oxygen species, which is a rate-determining step. This is because oligonuclear iron clusters in FeZSM-5 allow for faster recombination compared to isolated iron ions in Fe-silicalite. The difference in the ease of oxygen recombination affects the efficiency of N2O decomposition and, consequently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 铁基ZSM-5分子筛通过蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换等合成方法，其在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化性能受到影响。与Fe-硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化后的FeZSM-5在直接N2O分解和与N2O和O2的丙烷氧化脱氢中表现出更高的活性和选择性。催化性能取决于铁物种的性质和分布，尤其是FeZSM-5中存在寡核FexOy簇，这促进了反应。

2. 衡量这些分子筛在不同反应条件下的有效性的关键指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。与Fe-硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化后的FeZSM-5在N2O作用下的C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率更高。这表明FeZSM-5中铁分布和聚集体的存在提高了丙烷氧化功能化的催化性能。

3. FeZSM-5在直接N2O分解中的较高活性归因于原子氧物种的更易于重组，这是决定步骤。这是因为FeZSM-5中的寡核铁簇允许更快的重组，与Fe-硅酸盐中孤立的铁离子相比。重组氧气的不同效率影响N2O分解的效率，进而影响丙烷的氧化脱氢。
