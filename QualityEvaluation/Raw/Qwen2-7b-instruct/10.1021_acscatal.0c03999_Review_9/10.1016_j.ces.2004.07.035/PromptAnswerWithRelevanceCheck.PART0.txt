[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "The TEOM provides information on activity, deactivation, and regeneration by simultaneous measurement of reaction and mass changes."

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods affect the structure and properties of the zeolites, thereby impacting their efficiency in converting propane to propene. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

2. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites can impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment affects the structure of the zeolite, enhancing its ability to interact with reactants. Solid-state ion exchange can alter the acidity of the zeolite, influencing its selectivity for propene production. Liquid exchange might modify the distribution of iron ions within the zeolite framework, affecting the availability of active sites for the reaction. These modifications lead to variations in C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, which are critical performance indicators.

3. The steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange methods of synthesizing iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites can significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These techniques alter the structural and chemical properties of the zeolites, which in turn affect their ability to convert propane into propene efficiently. The key performance metrics that highlight their effectiveness include the conversion rates of C3H8 and N2O, the selectivity for propene production, and the yield of propene itself.

2. The Teledyne Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) is utilized in conjunction with real-time product analysis to rationally design the sequence of experiments in the cyclic process. 

3. In a setup featuring two parallel fixed-bed reactors utilizing FeZSM-5, stable propene yields exceeding 20% were achieved during the cycling process for 2000 minutes, with reaction and regeneration temperatures set at 723 and 823 K, respectively.

4. After a 400-minute reaction phase at 723 K, a FeZSM-5 sample was subjected to regeneration through a temperature ramp in helium to 823 K (10 K/min), followed by 5 minutes of air regeneration at 823 K, and cooling back to 723 K in helium at a rate of 10 K/min.

5. The residual propylene yield observed in fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 samples was notably similar, indicating that the catalytic properties remain largely unchanged post-regeneration.

6. To reduce the rate of coke deactivation, the approach involves modifying catalyst attributes such as the active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions.

7. This innovative catalytic process offers economic applicability in the tail-gas of specific chemical processes, particularly those involving HNO3 as an oxidizing agent, where N2O is produced in high concentrations (typically 25-40 vol%).

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods alter the structure and functionality of the zeolites, impacting their ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation process effectively. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. C3H8 conversion: The percentage of propane that undergoes dehydrogenation.
2. N2O conversion: The extent to which N2O is utilized in the reaction.
3. C3H6 selectivity: The ratio of propene produced to other products formed in the reaction.
4. C3H6 yield: The total amount of propene generated relative to the initial amount of propane.

These metrics are influenced by the synthesis method, as different methods can result in zeolites with varying porosity, acidity, and metal distribution, affecting the catalytic efficiency. The performance of these zeolites is typically evaluated under controlled conditions, with the TEOM studies providing insights into the activity, deactivation, and regeneration processes, which are critical for optimizing the reaction parameters and designing effective cyclic processes for continuous propene production.
