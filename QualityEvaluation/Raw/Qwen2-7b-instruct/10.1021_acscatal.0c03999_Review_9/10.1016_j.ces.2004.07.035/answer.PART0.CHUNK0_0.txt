[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "The TEOM provides information on activity, deactivation, and regeneration by simultaneous measurement of reaction and mass changes."
[5] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods affect the structure and properties of the zeolites, thereby impacting their efficiency in converting propane to propene. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

2. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites can impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment affects the structure of the zeolite, enhancing its ability to interact with reactants. Solid-state ion exchange can alter the acidity of the zeolite, influencing its selectivity for propene production. Liquid exchange might modify the distribution of iron ions within the zeolite framework, affecting the availability of active sites for the reaction. These modifications lead to variations in C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, which are critical performance indicators.

3. The steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange methods of synthesizing iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites can significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These techniques alter the structural and chemical properties of the zeolites, which in turn affect their ability to convert propane into propene efficiently. The key performance metrics that highlight their effectiveness include the conversion rates of C3H8 and N2O, the selectivity for propene production, and the yield of propene itself.
