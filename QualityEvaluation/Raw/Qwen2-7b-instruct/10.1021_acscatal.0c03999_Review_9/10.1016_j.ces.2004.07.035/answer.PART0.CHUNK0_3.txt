[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."
[5] "The performance of regenerated FeZSM-5 at 723 K is shown in Fig. 5. This sample was obtained after reaction at 723 K during 400 min, followed by a temperature ramp in He to 823 K (10 K min−1), air-regeneration at 823 K for 5 min, and cooling in He to 723 K (10 K min−1)."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. These metrics are crucial indicators of the catalyst's efficiency under different reaction conditions.
2. The steam-activated iron-zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for the ODHP reaction using N2O, achieving initial propene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, they deactivate due to coking.
3. A cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production through the ODHP reaction has been developed, featuring alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles.
4. To rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to online analysis of products has been applied.
5. The use of two fixed-bed reactors in parallel with FeZSM-5 catalysts allows for the achievement of stable propene yields greater than 20% during 2000 minutes of cycling, utilizing reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively.
