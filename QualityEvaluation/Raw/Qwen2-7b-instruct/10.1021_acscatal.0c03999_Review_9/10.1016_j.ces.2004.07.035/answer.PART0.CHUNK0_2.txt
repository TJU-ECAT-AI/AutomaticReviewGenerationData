[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."
[5] "This catalytic process leads to the simultaneous valorization of C3H8 and N2O and can be economically applied for on-site propylene production using a low-cost source of N2O, e.g. in tail-gases of chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, can influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam-activated iron-zeolites are found to be highly efficient catalysts for the ODHP reaction using N2O, achieving initial propene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, they deactivate due to coking, which is a reversible process.

2. The cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production via the ODHP reaction has been developed to overcome the issue of catalyst deactivation. The feasibility of alternating reaction and regeneration cycles has been analyzed. To rationally design the sequence of these cycles, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with online analysis of products has been utilized.

3. In a system employing two parallel fixed-bed reactors using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields greater than 20% have been obtained during cycling for 2000 minutes. The reaction temperature was set at 723 K, while the regeneration temperature was 823 K. This process allows for the simultaneous valorization of C3H8 and N2O, making it economically viable for on-site propylene production using a low-cost source of N2O, such as in tail-gases from chemical processes where N2O is produced in high concentration.

1. 不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，可以影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。关键的性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。蒸汽活化的铁基沸石被发现是使用N2O进行ODHP反应的高效催化剂，在723 K时，初始丙烯产率达到25%。然而，由于结焦导致催化剂失活，这是一种可逆的过程。

2. 开发了一种循环操作过程，以连续生产丙烯，通过N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应。分析了交替反应和再生周期的可行性。为了合理设计这些周期的序列，应用了带振荡微平衡的尖锥元件（TEOM）结合产品的在线分析。

3. 在使用FeZSM-5的两个并联固定床反应器系统中，通过循环操作获得了超过20%的稳定丙烯产率，持续时间为2000分钟。反应温度设定为723 K，再生温度为823 K。该过程允许同时利用C3H8和N2O，使其在低成本N2O源（例如化学过程中产生的高浓度N2O尾气）上经济地用于现场丙烯生产。
