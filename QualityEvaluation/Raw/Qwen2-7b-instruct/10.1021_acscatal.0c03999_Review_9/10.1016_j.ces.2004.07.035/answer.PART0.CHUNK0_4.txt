[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods alter the structure and functionality of the zeolites, impacting their ability to facilitate the dehydrogenation process effectively. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. C3H8 conversion: The percentage of propane that undergoes dehydrogenation.
2. N2O conversion: The extent to which N2O is utilized in the reaction.
3. C3H6 selectivity: The ratio of propene produced to other products formed in the reaction.
4. C3H6 yield: The total amount of propene generated relative to the initial amount of propane.

These metrics are influenced by the synthesis method, as different methods can result in zeolites with varying porosity, acidity, and metal distribution, affecting the catalytic efficiency. The performance of these zeolites is typically evaluated under controlled conditions, with the TEOM studies providing insights into the activity, deactivation, and regeneration processes, which are critical for optimizing the reaction parameters and designing effective cyclic processes for continuous propene production.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固相离子交换和液体交换，影响它们在使用N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。这些方法改变了沸石的结构和功能，影响其有效促进脱氢过程的能力。在不同反应条件下展示其有效性的关键性能指标包括：

1. C3H8转化率：参与脱氢的丙烷的比例。
2. N2O转化率：在反应中被利用的N2O量。
3. C3H6选择性：生成的丙烯与其他产物形成的比例。
4. C3H6产率：相对于初始丙烷量生成的丙烯总量。

这些指标受合成方法的影响，因为不同的方法可能导致具有不同孔隙度、酸性和金属分布的沸石，从而影响催化效率。通过TEOM研究，可以深入了解活性、失活和再生过程，这对于优化反应参数和设计有效的循环过程以实现连续丙烯生产至关重要。
