[1] "Steam-activated iron-zeolites (FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, Fe-beta) are highly efficient catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using N2O, with initial propene yields up to 25% at 723 K, but they deactivate due to coking."
[2] "Since catalyst deactivation is reversible, the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, with alternation of reaction and regeneration cycles, has been analysed."
[3] "In order to rationally design the sequence in the cyclic experiments, a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled to on-line analysis of products has been applied."
[4] "In a system with two fixed-bed reactors in parallel using FeZSM-5, stable propene yields > 20% were obtained during cycling for 2000 min, using reaction and regeneration temperatures of 723 and 823 K, respectively."
[5] "The performance of regenerated FeZSM-5 at 723 K is shown in Fig. 5. This sample was obtained after reaction at 723 K during 400 min, followed by a temperature ramp in He to 823 K (10 K min−1), air-regeneration at 823 K for 5 min, and cooling in He to 723 K (10 K min−1)."
[6] "Remarkably, the resid- ual propylene yield over fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 is very similar."
[7] "The best action to decrease the rate of coke deactivation is to tailor catalyst properties such as active phase, the tex- ture, the diffusion length, and reaction conditions."

1. Steam-activated iron-zeolites, including FeZSM-5, Fe-silicalite, and Fe-beta, exhibit high efficiency in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, achieving initial propene yields of up to 25% at 723 K. However, they become deactivated due to coke formation. The reversibility of this deactivation process allows for the feasibility of a cyclically-operated process for continuous propene production, alternating between reaction and regeneration phases.

2. The Teledyne Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM) is utilized in conjunction with real-time product analysis to rationally design the sequence of experiments in the cyclic process. 

3. In a setup featuring two parallel fixed-bed reactors utilizing FeZSM-5, stable propene yields exceeding 20% were achieved during the cycling process for 2000 minutes, with reaction and regeneration temperatures set at 723 and 823 K, respectively.

4. After a 400-minute reaction phase at 723 K, a FeZSM-5 sample was subjected to regeneration through a temperature ramp in helium to 823 K (10 K/min), followed by 5 minutes of air regeneration at 823 K, and cooling back to 723 K in helium at a rate of 10 K/min.

5. The residual propylene yield observed in fresh and regenerated FeZSM-5 samples was notably similar, indicating that the catalytic properties remain largely unchanged post-regeneration.

6. To reduce the rate of coke deactivation, the approach involves modifying catalyst attributes such as the active phase, texture, diffusion length, and reaction conditions.

7. This innovative catalytic process offers economic applicability in the tail-gas of specific chemical processes, particularly those involving HNO3 as an oxidizing agent, where N2O is produced in high concentrations (typically 25-40 vol%).

1. 铁沸石（FeZSM-5、Fe硅酸盐和Fe贝塔）在使用N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出高效性，能够在723 K下达到高达25%的初始丙烯产率。然而，由于焦炭形成，它们会失效。由于催化剂失活是可逆的，因此分析了连续丙烯生产的循环操作过程的可能性，该过程交替进行反应和再生周期。

2. 在循环实验中设计序列时，采用了振荡微平衡（TEOM）技术与在线产品分析相结合的方法。

3. 在使用FeZSM-5的两个并联固定床反应器系统中，通过在723和823 K之间的反应和再生阶段进行循环，实现了超过20%的稳定丙烯产率，持续时间长达2000分钟。

4. 经过400分钟在723 K下的反应阶段后，一个FeZSM-5样品经历了温度氦气梯度到823 K（10 K/min），随后在823 K下的空气再生5分钟，最后以10 K/min的速度冷却回723 K。

5. 新鲜和再生后的FeZSM-5样品的剩余丙烯产率非常相似，表明再生后催化性能基本保持不变。

6. 为了降低焦炭失活速率，通过调整催化剂特性，如活性相、结构、扩散长度以及反应条件来实现这一目标。

7. 这种创新的催化过程在涉及HNO3作为氧化剂的特定化学过程的尾气中具有经济应用的可能性，其中N2O的浓度通常为25-40体积分数。
