[1] "The results indicate that under typical CO2PDH conditions, propane dry reforming is thermodynamically much more favored, making the product distribution unfavorable."
[2] "These catalysts, like most other Group VIII metals, are good catalysts for dry reforming of propane (Solymosi et al., 2005). Consequently, the selectivity to propylene should be unacceptably low over Ptbased catalysts."
[3] "The main carboncontaining product is coke, the extent of which decreases with increasing temperature (Fig. 9). This can be attributed to the fact that coke gasification reactions (the reverse of reactions 8 and 9) converting coke to CO are endothermic and are favored at higher temperatures."
[4] "The main carbon containing product is coke over most of the range (Fig. 11). At very low CO2 mole fractions, the main reaction is propane pyrolysis. Upon increasing yCO2, the selectivity to both H2 and coke (as well as their equilibrium mole fraction) decreases which is due to their oxidation by CO2."

The document reveals several key points regarding propane dehydrogenation with carbon dioxide (CO2PDH):

1. Under typical CO2PDH conditions, propane dry reforming is thermodynamically more favored than the direct dehydrogenation of propane, leading to an unfavorable product distribution.

2. Catalysts commonly used for propane dehydrogenation, such as those containing Group VIII metals, are also effective for dry reforming of propane. This characteristic results in a low selectivity for propylene when using these catalysts in CO2PDH.

3. As the temperature increases, the extent of coke formation also increases. This is because the endothermic reactions that convert coke back to carbon monoxide (the reverse of reactions 8 and 9) are favored at higher temperatures, leading to increased coke formation.

4. With increasing concentration of carbon dioxide (yCO2), the selectivity for hydrogen and coke decreases. This is due to the oxidation of these components by carbon dioxide, which reduces their equilibrium mole fractions in the product mixture.

文档揭示了丙烷与二氧化碳（CO2PDH）脱氢过程中几个关键点：

1. 在典型CO2PDH条件下，丙烷干重整在热力学上更占优势，导致产品分布不利。

2. 常用于丙烷脱氢的催化剂，如含第VIII族金属的催化剂，对于丙烷干重整也十分有效。这导致使用这些催化剂进行CO2PDH时，丙烯选择性极低。

3. 温度升高时，焦炭形成量也会增加。这是因为将焦炭还原为一氧化碳的吸热反应（反应8和9的逆过程）在高温下更为有利，导致焦炭形成量增加。

4. 随着碳二浓度（yCO2）的增加，氢气和焦炭的选择性降低。这是由于二氧化碳对这两种成分的氧化，降低了它们在产物混合物中的平衡摩尔分数。
