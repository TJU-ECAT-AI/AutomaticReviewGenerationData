[1] "The results indicate that under typical CO2PDH conditions, propane dry reforming is thermodynamically much more favored, making the product distribution unfavorable."
[2] "The main carboncontaining product is coke, the extent of which decreases with increasing temperature (Fig. 9)."
[3] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for carbon dioxide dehydrogenation, as shown in Table 4. The main cause is rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation rendering precise conversion measurements impossible."
[4] "Consequently, much is to be done to achieve active and coke resistant catalysts to make use of the advantages of carbon dioxide in commercial dehydrogenation of light alkanes."

The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions. Some general conclusions are:

1. The equilibrium conversions of propane in the presence of CO2 are higher than in the presence of an inert gas or hydrogen with twostep > onestep.
2. The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation.
3. The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction.
4. Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is, propane dry reforming.
5. Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically.
6. Further research and development works are necessary to develop more efficient catalysts to realize this environmentally favorable process.

在反应网络中加入不同的副反应，如丙烷重整和焦炭形成，导致平衡组成发生巨大变化。一些一般性的结论如下：

1. 在CO2存在的下，丙烷的平衡转化率高于惰性气体或氢气中的转化率，两步 > 一步。
2. 报道的实验转化水平对于单步和两步丙烷脱氢化远低于预测的平衡值，这可以归因于催化剂的快速失活。
3. 在热力学模拟中包含副反应大大增加了丙烷转化率并降低了丙烯选择性，因为它们比主要反应更有利于热力学。
4. 更高的温度增强了CO和氢的选择性，即丙烷重整。
5. 更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比率减少了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除了控制不希望的副反应的催化剂动力学之外。
6. 需要进一步的研究和开发工作来开发更高效的催化剂，以实现这种环境友好的过程。
