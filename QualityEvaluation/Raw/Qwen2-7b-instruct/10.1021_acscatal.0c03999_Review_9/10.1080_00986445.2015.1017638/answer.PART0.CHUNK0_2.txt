[1] "The main carboncontaining product is coke, the extent of which decreases with increasing temperature (Fig. 9). This can be attributed to the fact that coke gasification reactions (the reverse of reactions 8 and 9) converting coke to CO are endothermic and are favored at higher temperatures."
[2] "Unfortunately, this is not the case for carbon dioxide dehydrogenation, as shown in Table 4. The main cause is rapid catalyst deactivation by coke formation rendering precise conversion measurements impossible."

The effect of operating conditions and side reactions on the equilibrium conversions and product compositions in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide was studied. The inclusion of different side reactions such as propane reforming and coke formation which corresponds to different catalysts and operating conditions in the reaction network results in dramatic changes in equilibrium compositions. Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming. Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically. The reported experimental conversion levels for one and twostep propane dehydrogenation are much lower than those predicted by equilibrium which could be attributed to the rapid catalyst deactivation.

在丙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢反应中，研究了操作条件和副反应对平衡转化率和产物组成的影响。将不同副反应（如丙烷重整和焦炭形成）纳入反应网络会导致平衡组成发生巨大变化。提高温度可以增加CO和氢的选择性，即丙烷干重整。更高的温度和CO2/C3H8比降低了焦炭形成倾向和丙烯产量，除了控制非期望副反应的催化剂。报道的实验转化率远远低于平衡预测值，这可能归因于催化剂的快速失活。
