[1] "The inclusion of side reactions in thermodynamic simulation greatly increases propane conversion and lowers propylene selectivity as they are thermodynamically more favorable than the main reaction."
[2] "Higher temperatures enhance the product selectivity to CO and hydrogen, that is,propane dry reforming."
[3] "Higher temperatures and CO2/C3H8 ratios reduce coke formation tendency and propylene yield as well, except for catalysts controlling undesired side reactions kinetically."

1. Side reactions in thermodynamic simulations lead to a significant increase in propane conversion and a decrease in propylene selectivity, as these side reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than the primary reaction. 

2. Increasing temperatures boost the selectivity for carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which corresponds to the process of propane dry reforming.

3. Elevating temperatures and the ratio of CO2 to propane lower the propensity for coke formation and reduce propylene yield, except for catalysts that manage unwanted side reactions through kinetic control.

1. 在热力学模拟中，副反应的加入导致丙烷转化率显著增加和丙烯选择性降低，因为这些副反应在热力学上比主要反应更有利。

2. 提高温度增加了CO和氢的选择性，对应于丙烷干重整的过程。

3. 升高温度和二氧化碳与丙烷的比例降低了焦炭生成倾向和丙烯产量，除了那些通过动力学控制管理不希望发生的副反应的催化剂。
