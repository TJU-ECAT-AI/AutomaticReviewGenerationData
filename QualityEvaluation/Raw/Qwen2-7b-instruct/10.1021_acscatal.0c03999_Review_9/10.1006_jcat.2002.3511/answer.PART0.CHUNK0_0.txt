[1] "FeZSM-5 catalysts are often prepared by solid- and liquid-ion exchange, or sublimation methods, using commercial zeolites. Calcination of these materials usually leads to the formation of a significant fraction of large iron oxide particles (see Fig. 1e), which are known to be inactive in the different reactions catalyzed by FeZSM-5 (3, 6, 9, 17)."
[2] "Also, ion-exchange methods often lack reproducibility (16, 24), which makes them unattractive from a catalytic point of view."
[3] "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 is undoubtedly a superior method for preparing FeZSM-5. The water-free conditions under which the exchange takes place allow full exchange of the 113"
[4] "However, in this case, the treatments after the CVD exchange strongly affect the state of the iron species. Calcination of the exchanged sample before a hydrolysis step mainly leads to the formation of large iron oxide (hematite) particles (18)."
[5] "We recently reported that ex-FeZSM-5 also yields significantly higher N2O decomposition activity (on a per Fe basis) than catalysts prepared via other procedures, such as liquid (aqueous)- or solid-ion exchange and sublimation (26, 27)."

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, can impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Steam treatment, in particular, leads to the formation of highly dispersed oxide nanoparticles of iron, enhancing the N2O decomposition activity compared to catalysts prepared through other methods. Ion-exchange methods often lack reproducibility, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 provides a superior way of preparing FeZSM-5, though the treatments after the CVD exchange affect the state of iron species, potentially leading to the formation of large iron oxide particles. The key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

各种合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生不同的影响。特别是蒸汽处理导致形成分散的铁氧化物纳米颗粒，这使得催化剂相对于通过其他方法（如液体（水溶液）-或固体离子交换和升华）制备的催化剂具有更高的N2O分解活性。离子交换方法往往缺乏可重复性，而化学气相沉积（CVD）FeCl3到HZSM-5的通道提供了一种制备FeZSM-5的更优方式，尽管CVD交换后的处理会改变铁物种的状态，可能引起大型铁氧化物颗粒的形成。这些催化剂的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同反应条件下展示其有效性。
