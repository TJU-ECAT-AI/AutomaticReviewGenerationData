[1] "Fe-based zeolites with MFI structure, including ZSM-5 and silicalite, are receiving increasing attention in the literature."
[2] "Reactions catalyzed by these materials include isomerization and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (1,2), and selective oxidation of benzene to phenol using N2O as the oxidant (3, 4)."
[3] "FeMFI also plays an important role in environmental catalysis for the reduction of NOx and N2O with hydrocarbons (HC-SCR) or ammonia (NH3-SCR) (512), direct N2O decomposition (13, 14), and selective oxidation of NH3 to N2 with O2 (15)."
[4] "FeZSM-5 catalysts are often prepared by solid- and liquid-ion exchange, or sublimation methods, using commercial zeolites. Calcination of these materials usually leads to the formation of a significant fraction of large iron oxide particles (see Fig. 1e), which are known to be inactive in the different reactions catalyzed by FeZSM-5 (3, 6, 9, 17)."
[5] "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 is undoubtedly a superior method for preparing FeZSM-5."
[6] "The water-free conditions under which the exchange takes place allow full exchange of the 113 0021-9517/02 $35.00 c 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) All rights reserved. 114"
[7] "However, in this case, the treatments after the CVD exchange strongly affect the state of the iron species."
[8] "Calcination of the exchanged sample before a hydrolysis step mainly leads to the formation of large iron oxide (hematite) particles (18)."
[9] "The heating rate during calcination was also found crucial in the development of these particles (25, 26)."
[10] "The nature of the active Fe species of ex-FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol was previously investigated by some of us using ultraviolet-visible (UVvis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (20)."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Steam treatment, particularly, affects the state of iron species, leading to dispersion into smaller nanoparticles, which is beneficial for the reaction. Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange, however, may result in the formation of large iron oxide particles, which are inactive in the ODHP reaction. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 is considered a superior method for preparing FeZSM-5 due to its ability to maintain the integrity of iron species. The treatments after CVD exchange significantly impact the state of the iron species, and the calcination process is crucial in the development of iron oxide particles. The nature of active Fe species in the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol reaction is influenced by these synthesis methods, affecting conversion rates, selectivity, and yield.

铁基沸石MFI结构（包括ZSM-5和硅铝酸盐）在文献中受到越来越多的关注。这些材料催化了烷烃的异构化和氧化脱氢反应（1,2），以及使用N2O作为氧化剂将苯氧化为苯酚（3,4）。FeMFI在环境催化中也起着重要作用，如以烃类或氨（NH3-SCR）还原NOx和N2O（5-12）、直接分解N2O（13,14）和选择性将NH3氧化为N2（15）。铁ZSM-5催化剂通常通过固体和液体离子交换、或升华方法制备，使用商业沸石。这些材料的煅烧通常导致形成大量铁氧化物颗粒（图1e），这在由FeZSM-5催化的不同反应中是不活性的（3,6,9,17）。化学气相沉积（CVD）FeCl3在HZSM-5通道中无疑是一种制备FeZSM-5的更优方法，其水自由条件允许全交换沸石中的铁离子。然而，CVD交换后的处理会强烈影响铁物种的状态。煅烧交换样品前的水解步骤主要导致形成大型铁氧化物（hematite）颗粒（18）。煅烧速率在发展这些颗粒中也至关重要（25,26）。蒸汽处理FeZSM-5催化剂在N2O介导的苯到苯酚反应中的活性铁物种性质已由我们研究组使用紫外可见光谱、X射线衍射和电子自旋共振进行了先前研究（20）。不同的合成方法对铁物种状态产生影响，从而影响催化性能，如丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。
