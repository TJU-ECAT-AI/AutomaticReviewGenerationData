[1] "FeZSM-5 catalysts are often prepared by solid- and liquid-ion exchange, or sublimation methods, using commercial zeolites. Calcination of these materials usually leads to the formation of a significant fraction of large iron oxide particles (see Fig. 1e), which are known to be inactive in the different reactions catalyzed by FeZSM-5 (3, 6, 9, 17)."
[2] "Also, ion-exchange methods often lack reproducibility (16, 24), which makes them unattractive from a catalytic point of view."
[3] "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 is undoubtedly a superior method for preparing FeZSM-5. The water-free conditions under which the exchange takes place allow full exchange of the 113"
[4] "However, in this case, the treatments after the CVD exchange strongly affect the state of the iron species. Calcination of the exchanged sample before a hydrolysis step mainly leads to the formation of large iron oxide (hematite) particles (18)."

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, can impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Steam treatment, in particular, leads to the formation of highly dispersed oxide nanoparticles of iron, enhancing the N2O decomposition activity compared to catalysts prepared through other methods. Ion-exchange methods often lack reproducibility, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 provides a superior way of preparing FeZSM-5, though the treatments after the CVD exchange affect the state of iron species, potentially leading to the formation of large iron oxide particles. The key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

各种合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对铁基ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生不同的影响。特别是蒸汽处理导致形成分散的铁氧化物纳米颗粒，这使得催化剂相对于通过其他方法（如液体（水溶液）-或固体离子交换和升华）制备的催化剂具有更高的N2O分解活性。离子交换方法往往缺乏可重复性，而化学气相沉积（CVD）FeCl3到HZSM-5的通道提供了一种制备FeZSM-5的更优方式，尽管CVD交换后的处理会改变铁物种的状态，可能引起大型铁氧化物颗粒的形成。这些催化剂的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同反应条件下展示其有效性。

1. Different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Steam treatment, compared to ion exchange and sublimation methods, tends to result in a higher N2O decomposition activity (on a per Fe basis) and better stability in the presence of O2, NO, SO2, and H2O, typical components in tail-gases from nitric acid manufacture and combustion processes.

2. Key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam treatment shows enhanced N2O conversion rates and maintains better stability over a wider range of conditions compared to traditional ion exchange and sublimation methods.

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Steam treatment, particularly, affects the state of iron species, leading to dispersion into smaller nanoparticles, which is beneficial for the reaction. Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange, however, may result in the formation of large iron oxide particles, which are inactive in the ODHP reaction. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 is considered a superior method for preparing FeZSM-5 due to its ability to maintain the integrity of iron species. The treatments after CVD exchange significantly impact the state of the iron species, and the calcination process is crucial in the development of iron oxide particles. The nature of active Fe species in the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol reaction is influenced by these synthesis methods, affecting conversion rates, selectivity, and yield.

铁基沸石MFI结构（包括ZSM-5和硅铝酸盐）在文献中受到越来越多的关注。这些材料催化了烷烃的异构化和氧化脱氢反应（1,2），以及使用N2O作为氧化剂将苯氧化为苯酚（3,4）。FeMFI在环境催化中也起着重要作用，如以烃类或氨（NH3-SCR）还原NOx和N2O（5-12）、直接分解N2O（13,14）和选择性将NH3氧化为N2（15）。铁ZSM-5催化剂通常通过固体和液体离子交换、或升华方法制备，使用商业沸石。这些材料的煅烧通常导致形成大量铁氧化物颗粒（图1e），这在由FeZSM-5催化的不同反应中是不活性的（3,6,9,17）。化学气相沉积（CVD）FeCl3在HZSM-5通道中无疑是一种制备FeZSM-5的更优方法，其水自由条件允许全交换沸石中的铁离子。然而，CVD交换后的处理会强烈影响铁物种的状态。煅烧交换样品前的水解步骤主要导致形成大型铁氧化物（hematite）颗粒（18）。煅烧速率在发展这些颗粒中也至关重要（25,26）。蒸汽处理FeZSM-5催化剂在N2O介导的苯到苯酚反应中的活性铁物种性质已由我们研究组使用紫外可见光谱、X射线衍射和电子自旋共振进行了先前研究（20）。不同的合成方法对铁物种状态产生影响，从而影响催化性能，如丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。

铁基沸石MFI结构，包括ZSM-5和硅酸盐，正在文献中受到越来越多的关注。这些材料催化不同的反应，如烷烃的异构化和氧化脱氢（1,2），以及用N2O作为氧化剂选择性氧化苯为苯酚（3, 4）。FeMFI在环境催化中也起着重要作用，用于以碳氢化合物或氨（NH3）为还原剂减少NOx和N2O（5–12），直接分解N2O（13, 14），以及选择性将氨氧化为氮气（15）。FeZSM-5催化剂通常通过固体交换、液体交换或升华方法制备，使用商用沸石。这些材料的煅烧通常导致大量铁氧化物颗粒的形成（见图1e），这在由FeZSM-5催化的不同反应中是无效的（3, 6, 9, 17）。先前的研究表明，通过蒸汽处理制备的FeZSM-5催化剂表现出高苯酚产率（在7小时时间流速下为0.8 mmol·h−1·g−1），用于苯与N2O的氧化脱氢。这种催化剂，称为ex-FeZSM-5，通过水热合成等摩尔置换FeZSM-5，随后在823 K进行煅烧并在873 K进行蒸汽处理。最近的研究显示，ex-FeZSM-5的N2O分解活性（基于Fe的比率）显著高于通过其他方法（如液体（水溶液）或固体交换和升华）制备的催化剂（26, 27）。紫外线可见分析表明，蒸汽处理使铁迁移到额外框架位置，而不改变结晶结构的长期排列，如X射线衍射所推断。从电子自旋共振分析，两种可逆物种被识别，但无法明确地给定催化剂中的铁物种的分配。尽管不同的作者已经研究了在空气中对等摩尔置换Fe-silicalite的热处理（28, 29）期间铁的提取，但在蒸汽处理过程中FeZSM-5催化剂的激活过程和形成物种的性质的详细表征尚未报告。
