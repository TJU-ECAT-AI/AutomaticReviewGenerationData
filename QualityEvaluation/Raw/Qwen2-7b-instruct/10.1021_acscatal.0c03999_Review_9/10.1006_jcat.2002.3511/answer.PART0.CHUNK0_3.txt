[1] "Fe-based zeolites with MFI structure, including ZSM-5 and silicalite, are receiving increasing attention in the literature."
[2] "Reactions catalyzed by these materials include isomerization and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (1,2), and selective oxidation of benzene to phenol using N2O as the oxidant (3, 4)."
[3] "FeMFI also plays an important role in environmental catalysis for the reduction of NOx and N2O with hydrocarbons (HC-SCR) or ammonia (NH3-SCR) (5–12), direct N2O decomposition (13, 14), and selective oxidation of NH3 to N2 with O2 (15)."
[4] "Different forms of iron have been identified in FeZSM-5 (Fig. 1). These include isolated ions either (a) in framework positions (isomorphously substituted) or (b) in cationic positions in the zeolite channels, (c) binuclear and, in general, oligonuclear iron complexes in extraframework positions, (d) iron oxide FeOx nanoparticles of size 2 nm, and (e) large iron oxide particles (Fe2O3) in a wide distribution (up to 25 nm in size) located at the surface of the zeolite crystal."
[5] "FeZSM-5 catalysts are often prepared by solid- and liquid-ion exchange, or sublimation methods, using commercial zeolites. Calcination of these materials usually leads to the formation of a significant fraction of large iron oxide particles (see Fig. 1e), which are known to be inactive in the different reactions catalyzed by FeZSM-5 (3, 6, 9, 17)."
[6] "In an earlier paper (20), some of us reported the performance of steamed FeZSM-5 for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol with N2O, displaying high phenol productivity (0.8 mmol of phenol · h−1 · g−1 during 7 h time on stream). This catalyst, hereafter denoted ex-FeZSM-5, was prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis of isomorphously substituted FeZSM-5, followed by calcination at 823 K and steam treatment at 873 K."
[7] "We recently reported that ex-FeZSM-5 also yields significantly higher N2O decomposition activity (on a per Fe basis) than catalysts prepared via other procedures, such as liquid (aqueous)- or solid-ion exchange and sublimation (26, 27)."
[8] "The nature of the active Fe species of ex-FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol was previously investigated by some of us using ultraviolet-visible (UVvis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (20)."
[9] "UVvis analysis showed that steam treatment induces the migration of Fe to extraframework positions, without an apparent modification of the long-range ordering of the crystalline structure, as concluded from XRD. From EPR, two redox active species were identified but an unambiguous assignment of the iron species in the catalyst could not be given."
[10] "Although different authors have investigated the extraction of iron from isomorphously substituted Fe-silicalite upon thermal treatment in the range of 773–1073 K in air (28, 29), a detailed characterization of the activation of the FeZSM-5 and nature of the species formed by the steaming procedure has not been reported."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam treatment of FeZSM-5 catalysts leads to a significant migration of iron to extraframework positions, enhancing the redox activity and improving the N2O conversion efficiency. Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange methods often result in the formation of large iron oxide particles, which are inactive in the ODHP reaction. The steamed FeZSM-5 catalyst, prepared through hydrothermal synthesis followed by calcination and steam treatment, exhibits high phenol productivity and enhanced N2O decomposition activity compared to catalysts prepared via other synthesis methods. However, detailed characterization of the activation process and the nature of the active Fe species in the steamed FeZSM-5 catalyst require further investigation.

铁基沸石MFI结构，包括ZSM-5和硅酸盐，正在文献中受到越来越多的关注。这些材料催化不同的反应，如烷烃的异构化和氧化脱氢（1,2），以及用N2O作为氧化剂选择性氧化苯为苯酚（3, 4）。FeMFI在环境催化中也起着重要作用，用于以碳氢化合物或氨（NH3）为还原剂减少NOx和N2O（5–12），直接分解N2O（13, 14），以及选择性将氨氧化为氮气（15）。FeZSM-5催化剂通常通过固体交换、液体交换或升华方法制备，使用商用沸石。这些材料的煅烧通常导致大量铁氧化物颗粒的形成（见图1e），这在由FeZSM-5催化的不同反应中是无效的（3, 6, 9, 17）。先前的研究表明，通过蒸汽处理制备的FeZSM-5催化剂表现出高苯酚产率（在7小时时间流速下为0.8 mmol·h−1·g−1），用于苯与N2O的氧化脱氢。这种催化剂，称为ex-FeZSM-5，通过水热合成等摩尔置换FeZSM-5，随后在823 K进行煅烧并在873 K进行蒸汽处理。最近的研究显示，ex-FeZSM-5的N2O分解活性（基于Fe的比率）显著高于通过其他方法（如液体（水溶液）或固体交换和升华）制备的催化剂（26, 27）。紫外线可见分析表明，蒸汽处理使铁迁移到额外框架位置，而不改变结晶结构的长期排列，如X射线衍射所推断。从电子自旋共振分析，两种可逆物种被识别，但无法明确地给定催化剂中的铁物种的分配。尽管不同的作者已经研究了在空气中对等摩尔置换Fe-silicalite的热处理（28, 29）期间铁的提取，但在蒸汽处理过程中FeZSM-5催化剂的激活过程和形成物种的性质的详细表征尚未报告。
