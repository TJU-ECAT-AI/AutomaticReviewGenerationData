[1] "FeZSM-5 catalysts are often prepared by solid- and liquid-ion exchange, or sublimation methods, using commercial zeolites."
[2] "Calcination of these materials usually leads to the formation of a significant fraction of large iron oxide particles (see Fig. 1e), which are known to be inactive in the different reactions catalyzed by FeZSM-5 (3, 6, 9, 17)."
[3] "Also,ion-exchange methods often lack reproducibility (16, 24),which makes them unattractive from a catalytic point of view."
[4] "Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of FeCl3 in the channels of HZSM-5 is undoubtedly a superior method for preparing FeZSM-5."
[5] "However, in this case, the treatments after the CVD exchange strongly affect the state of the iron species."
[6] "We recently reported that ex-FeZSM-5 also yields significantly higher N2O decomposition activity (on a per Fe basis) than catalysts prepared via other procedures, such as liquid (aqueous)- or solid-ion exchange and sublimation (26, 27)."
[7] "Furthermore, an improved stability for direct N2O decomposition in the presence of O2, NO, SO2, and H2O, typically present in tail-gases from nitric acid manufacture and combustion processes, has been observed (26, 27)."
[8] "UVvis analysis showed that steam treatment induces the migration of Fe to extraframework positions, without an apparent modification of the long-range ordering of the crystalline structure, as concluded from XRD."
[9] "From EPR, two redox active species were identified but an unambiguous assignment of the iron species in the catalyst could not be given."

1. Different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction differently. Steam treatment, compared to ion exchange and sublimation methods, tends to result in a higher N2O decomposition activity (on a per Fe basis) and better stability in the presence of O2, NO, SO2, and H2O, typical components in tail-gases from nitric acid manufacture and combustion processes.

2. Key performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam treatment shows enhanced N2O conversion rates and maintains better stability over a wider range of conditions compared to traditional ion exchange and sublimation methods.

1. 不同合成方法的铁基ZSM-5沸石，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对丙烷在N2O辅助下的氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应的催化性能有不同的影响。与传统的离子交换和升华方法相比，蒸汽处理导致更高的N2O分解活性（基于Fe的），并且在存在O2、NO、SO2和H2O等条件下有更好的稳定性，这些成分通常存在于硝酸制造和燃烧过程的尾气中。

2. 衡量这些方法在不同反应条件下的有效性的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。蒸汽处理显示了增强的N2O转化率，并且在更广泛的一系列条件下保持更好的稳定性，与传统的离子交换和升华方法相比。
