[1] "Fe-based zeolites with MFI structure, including ZSM-5 and silicalite, are receiving increasing attention in the literature. Reactions catalyzed by these materials include isomerization and oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes (1,2), and selective oxidation of benzene to phenol using N2O as the oxidant (3, 4)."
[2] "FeMFI also plays an important role in environmental catalysis for the reduction of NOx and N2O with hydrocarbons (HC-SCR) or ammonia (NH3-SCR) (5–12), direct N2O decomposition (13, 14), and selective oxidation of NH3 to N2 with O2 (15)."
[3] "In an earlier paper (20), some of us reported the performance of steamed FeZSM-5 for selective oxidation of benzene to phenol with N2O, displaying high phenol productivity."
[4] "We recently reported that ex-FeZSM-5 also yields significantly higher N2O decomposition activity (on a per Fe basis) than catalysts prepared via other procedures, such as liquid (aqueous)- or solid-ion exchange and sublimation (26, 27)."
[5] "The nature of the active Fe species of ex-FeZSM-5 in the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol was previously investigated using ultraviolet-visible (UVvis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (20)."
[6] "From EPR, two redox active species were identified but an unambiguous assignment of the iron species in the catalyst could not be given."

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam treatment of FeZSM-5 has been shown to enhance N2O decomposition activity compared to catalysts prepared through other methods, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing catalytic performance.

2. The performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The steam treatment of FeZSM-5 catalysts has been associated with higher N2O conversion rates, demonstrating its effectiveness in the ODHP reaction.

3. Ultraviolet-visible (UVvis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses have been used to investigate the nature of active Fe species in ex-FeZSM-5 for the N2O-mediated benzene to phenol reaction. These studies have identified two redox active species but have not provided a definitive assignment of the iron species within the catalyst.

4. The effectiveness of steam treatment in enhancing the catalytic performance of FeZSM-5 catalysts for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction is supported by the increased N2O conversion rates observed in comparison to catalysts prepared through other synthesis methods.

1. 不同合成方法（如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换）对含铁ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能产生影响。蒸汽处理FeZSM-5催化剂已被证明比通过其他方法制备的催化剂具有更高的N2O分解活性，这表明其在催化性能方面的有效性。

2. 用于评估这些催化剂在不同反应条件下的有效性的关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。蒸汽处理FeZSM-5催化剂已被关联到更高的N2O转化率，这表明其在ODHP反应中的有效性。

3. 使用紫外可见(UVvis)、X射线衍射(XRD)和电子自旋共振(EPR)分析已研究了ex-FeZSM-5催化剂中活性铁物种的性质，用于N2O介导的苯至苯酚反应。这些研究表明存在两种可还原活性物种，但未能对催化剂内的铁物种进行明确的归属。

4. 蒸汽处理在增强FeZSM-5催化剂的N2O辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）性能的有效性得到了支持，通过观察与通过其他合成方法制备的催化剂相比，N2O转化率的提高来证实这一点。
