<p>The effect of injection of hydrogen sulfide, an available inexpensive byproduct in Iran's petrochemical industry, on the rate of coke formation over chromium, iron, and stainless-steel (SS) coupons in thermal cracking of ethane was investigated.</p>
<p>In a laboratory reactor, coke formation on the metal coupons was measured in the temperature range of 10981148 K after a fixed time of 900 s. Nitrogen was used as an inert diluent to exclude the concomitant coke oxidation in the commonplace steam-cracking process.</p>
<p>The presulfidation reduced the rates of coke formation up to 20, 45, and 30% over Cr, Fe, and SS samples, respectively.</p>
<p>However, the continuous injection of hydrogen sulfide showed a complex behavior depending upon the temperature, so that the rate of coke formation increased by 20120% at higher temperatures but decreased by 2530% at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>An empirical model was developed to predict the rate of coke formation over the selected metal samples at given operating conditions and known H2S and ethylene concentrations.</p>
<p>The model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results.</p>

The study investigated the impact of hydrogen sulfide on coke formation during ethane cracking over chromium, iron, and stainless steel coupons. The presulfidation process reduced coke formation rates by up to 30% for stainless steel, 45% for iron, and 20% for chromium. Continuous hydrogen sulfide injection showed a temperature-dependent effect, increasing coke formation rates by 20-120% at higher temperatures and decreasing by 25-30% at lower temperatures. An empirical model accurately predicted coke formation rates under various conditions.

研究了氢硫化物在乙烯裂解过程中对铬、铁和不锈钢垫片上焦炭形成的影响。预硫化过程分别减少了高达30%、45%和20%的焦炭形成率，对于不锈钢、铁和铬。连续注入氢硫化物显示出温度依赖性效果，在较高温度下焦炭形成速率增加20-120%，在较低温度下减少25-30%。建立了一个经验模型来预测在不同条件下选定金属样品的焦炭形成速率，并且实验结果与该模型的预测结果相吻合。
