<p>However, the greatest effects of the concentration and DR were observed in the results of Fe and SS, respectively. However, their contributions are less than half those of the temperature.</p>
<p>It was found that the greatest reduction in the rate of coke formation over Cr was achieved by the simultaneous choice of high temperatures and low DRs. However, for presulfidation of Fe and SS, the opposite was favored.</p>
<p>A qualitative inspection of the experimental data resulted in a kinetic model for the coke formation in ethane cracking with hydrogen sulfide as the additive. The parameters of this model were estimated from the experimental data. The proposed empirical model was able to capture all of the trends over the entire operating range investigated.</p>

The investigation showed that the injection of hydrogen sulfide as a pretreatment agent or additive significantly affects the rate of coke formation during ethane cracking. The presulfidation of metal surfaces with hydrogen sulfide reduced the rate of coke formation by up to 20%, 45%, and 30% for chromium, iron, and stainless steel, respectively. The continuous injection of hydrogen sulfide exhibited a complex behavior depending on temperature, increasing the rate of coke formation by 20-120% at higher temperatures but decreasing it by 25-30% at lower temperatures. The kinetic model developed for the process captures the trends over the entire operating range, demonstrating the effectiveness of hydrogen sulfide in reducing coke formation under different conditions.

研究显示，氢硫化物作为预处理剂或添加剂在乙烯裂解过程中的注入显著影响焦炭形成速率。铬、铁和不锈钢表面用氢硫化物进行预硫化分别可将焦炭形成速率降低至20%、45%和30%。连续注入氢硫化物表现出复杂的温度依赖性行为，在较高温度下，焦炭形成速率增加20%-120%，而在较低温度下，焦炭形成速率下降25%-30%。所开发的动力学模型能够捕捉整个操作范围内的趋势，证明了氢硫化物在不同条件下减少焦炭沉积的有效性。
