<p>The purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of injection of hydrogen sulfide as the surface pretreatment agent or the additive on the rate of coke formation during ethane cracking over three samples of chromium, iron, and SS.</p>
<p>Three process variables were taken into account: the reaction temperature, the concentration of the additive, and the nitrogen/ethane ratio.</p>
<p>A kinetic model is also proposed in the same line on the basis of the results obtained from the experimental program implemented.</p>

The study aimed to investigate the impact of hydrogen sulfide, used as a pretreatment agent or additive, on the rate of coke formation during ethane cracking over chromium, iron, and stainless steel samples. The researchers considered three process variables: reaction temperature, additive concentration, and nitrogen/ethane ratio. They also developed a kinetic model based on the experimental outcomes.
