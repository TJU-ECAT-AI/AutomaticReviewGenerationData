The study investigates how hydrogen sulfide, an inexpensive byproduct in Iran's petrochemical industry, affects the rate of coke formation during the thermal cracking of ethane on chromium, iron, and stainless steel samples. Nitrogen is used as an inert diluent to prevent coke oxidation, commonly found in steam-cracking processes. The hydrogen sulfide's impact is assessed through two feeding methods: presulfidation with a 200 ppmw concentration for 20 minutes, and continuous introduction of 25 and 50 ppmw hydrogen sulfide. Presulfidation reduces the coke formation rates by 20%, 45%, and 30% for chromium, iron, and stainless steel, respectively. However, the continuous hydrogen sulfide injection exhibits complex behavior dependent on temperature, causing coke formation rates to increase by 20-120% at higher temperatures and decrease by 25-30% at lower temperatures. An empirical model predicts the coke formation rate over selected metal samples under given operating conditions and known hydrogen sulfide and ethylene concentrations.

研究了伊朗石化工业中可用的廉价副产品氢硫化物对乙烯热裂解过程中铬、铁和不锈钢样品上焦炭形成速率的影响。使用氮作为惰性稀释剂，以排除常见蒸汽裂解过程中的焦炭氧化。通过纯预硫化方法（以200 ppmw浓度进行20分钟）和连续向气流中注入25和50 ppmw氢硫化物来评估氢硫化物的作用。预硫化减少了铬、铁和不锈钢样本上的焦炭形成速率，分别达到20%、45%和30%。然而，连续注入氢硫化物的行为复杂，取决于温度，导致在较高温度下焦炭形成速率增加20%-120%，在较低温度下减少25%-30%。开发了一种经验模型，用于预测在给定操作条件和已知氢硫化物及乙烷浓度下的焦炭形成速率。
