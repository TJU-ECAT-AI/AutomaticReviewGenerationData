How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

<p>However, the greatest effects of the concentration and DR were observed in the results of Fe and SS, respectively. However, their contributions are less than half those of the temperature.</p>
<p>It was found that the greatest reduction in the rate of coke formation over Cr was achieved by the simultaneous choice of high temperatures and low DRs. However, for presulfidation of Fe and SS, the opposite was favored.</p>
<p>A qualitative inspection of the experimental data resulted in a kinetic model for the coke formation in ethane cracking with hydrogen sulfide as the additive. The parameters of this model were estimated from the experimental data. The proposed empirical model was able to capture all of the trends over the entire operating range investigated.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The investigation showed that the injection of hydrogen sulfide as a pretreatment agent or additive significantly affects the rate of coke formation during ethane cracking. The presulfidation of metal surfaces with hydrogen sulfide reduced the rate of coke formation by up to 20%, 45%, and 30% for chromium, iron, and stainless steel, respectively. The continuous injection of hydrogen sulfide exhibited a complex behavior depending on temperature, increasing the rate of coke formation by 20-120% at higher temperatures but decreasing it by 25-30% at lower temperatures. The kinetic model developed for the process captures the trends over the entire operating range, demonstrating the effectiveness of hydrogen sulfide in reducing coke formation under different conditions.

<p>The effect of injection of hydrogen sulfide, an available inexpensive byproduct in Iran's petrochemical industry, on the rate of coke formation over chromium, iron, and stainless-steel (SS) coupons in thermal cracking of ethane was investigated.</p>
<p>In a laboratory reactor, coke formation on the metal coupons was measured in the temperature range of 10981148 K after a fixed time of 900 s. Nitrogen was used as an inert diluent to exclude the concomitant coke oxidation in the commonplace steam-cracking process.</p>
<p>The presulfidation reduced the rates of coke formation up to 20, 45, and 30% over Cr, Fe, and SS samples, respectively.</p>
<p>However, the continuous injection of hydrogen sulfide showed a complex behavior depending upon the temperature, so that the rate of coke formation increased by 20120% at higher temperatures but decreased by 2530% at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>An empirical model was developed to predict the rate of coke formation over the selected metal samples at given operating conditions and known H2S and ethylene concentrations.</p>
<p>The model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results.</p>

The study investigated the impact of hydrogen sulfide on coke formation during ethane cracking over chromium, iron, and stainless steel coupons. The presulfidation process reduced coke formation rates by up to 30% for stainless steel, 45% for iron, and 20% for chromium. Continuous hydrogen sulfide injection showed a temperature-dependent effect, increasing coke formation rates by 20-120% at higher temperatures and decreasing by 25-30% at lower temperatures. An empirical model accurately predicted coke formation rates under various conditions.

<p>It is believed that the influence of sulfur-type additives on the coking rate depends upon their thermal stability under thermal cracking operation conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the additive must reduce the coke formation without significantly affecting the conversion or selectivity for the main desirable products, although they might have some disadvantages, such as showing undesired effects, including corrosion, at the downstream units, particularly, in the separation section.</p>
<p>The rate of coke formation in thermal cracking of naphtha with an Incoloy 800HT mixed-flow reactor decreased by more than 20% using a combination of S- and Si-type additives.</p>
<p>Similarly, the use of hydrogen sulfide in pyrolysis of propane had a significant effect on the rate of carbon formation.</p>
<p>No changes were detected in the products of pyrolysis reactions, but carbon formation was either inhibited or accelerated.</p>
<p>The purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of injection of hydrogen sulfide as the surface pretreatment agent or the additive on the rate of coke formation during ethane cracking over three samples of chromium, iron, and SS.</p>

The study investigates how hydrogen sulfide, an inexpensive byproduct in Iran's petrochemical industry, affects the rate of coke formation during the thermal cracking of ethane on chromium, iron, and stainless steel samples. Nitrogen is used as an inert diluent to prevent coke oxidation, commonly found in steam-cracking processes. The hydrogen sulfide's impact is assessed through two feeding methods: presulfidation with a 200 ppmw concentration for 20 minutes, and continuous introduction of 25 and 50 ppmw hydrogen sulfide. Presulfidation reduces the coke formation rates by 20%, 45%, and 30% for chromium, iron, and stainless steel, respectively. However, the continuous hydrogen sulfide injection exhibits complex behavior dependent on temperature, causing coke formation rates to increase by 20-120% at higher temperatures and decrease by 25-30% at lower temperatures. An empirical model predicts the coke formation rate over selected metal samples under given operating conditions and known hydrogen sulfide and ethylene concentrations.
