<p>It is believed that the influence of sulfur-type additives on the coking rate depends upon their thermal stability under thermal cracking operation conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the additive must reduce the coke formation without significantly affecting the conversion or selectivity for the main desirable products, although they might have some disadvantages, such as showing undesired effects, including corrosion, at the downstream units, particularly, in the separation section.</p>
<p>The rate of coke formation in thermal cracking of naphtha with an Incoloy 800HT mixed-flow reactor decreased by more than 20% using a combination of S- and Si-type additives.</p>
<p>Similarly, the use of hydrogen sulfide in pyrolysis of propane had a significant effect on the rate of carbon formation.</p>
<p>No changes were detected in the products of pyrolysis reactions, but carbon formation was either inhibited or accelerated.</p>
<p>The purpose of this work is to investigate the effect of injection of hydrogen sulfide as the surface pretreatment agent or the additive on the rate of coke formation during ethane cracking over three samples of chromium, iron, and SS.</p>

The document investigates how hydrogen sulfide affects the rate of coke formation during ethane cracking on chromium, iron, and stainless steel samples. It examines the effects of varying reaction temperatures, concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, and nitrogen/ethane ratios. The study aims to develop a kinetic model for predicting the coking rate based on the experimental findings.
