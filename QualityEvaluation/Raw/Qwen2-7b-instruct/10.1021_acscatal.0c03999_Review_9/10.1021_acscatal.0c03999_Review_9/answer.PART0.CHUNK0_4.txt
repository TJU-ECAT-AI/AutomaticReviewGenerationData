[1] "In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts."
[2] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."
[3] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."
[4] "Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites."
[5] "Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity."
[6] "On the basis of such observations, the following mechanism is proposed:... In the proposed mechanism, the Fe3+Fe2+ cycle operates on the highly isolated extra-framework FeOAl site to decompose N2O to N2 and O2..."
[7] "While it is reported that both cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP than iron-containing ZSM-5, there are insufficient data to definitively draw assertion."
[8] "However, the catalytic performance of most of these frameworks is inferior to the MFI zeolites, not only possessing lower C3H6 yield but also fast deactivation."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. **Catalyst Conversion**: Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 shows a C3H8 conversion of 48% at 450°C. This value indicates the extent of propane conversion to more reactive intermediates.

2. **Catalyst Selectivity**: The N2O conversion reached 96% under the same conditions, suggesting a high efficiency in utilizing N2O as a reagent. The C3H6 selectivity of 45% highlights the preference of the catalyst for producing propene over other products.

3. **Catalyst Yield**: Synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange, Fe-ZSM-5 displays a C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% across the temperature range of 377 to 527°C. These figures reflect the catalyst's efficiency in converting propane to propene with minimal side products.

4. **Characterization Techniques**: Studies employing NH3TPD and XRD show a notable reduction in acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5. This reduction is attributed to extensive dealumination of the zeolite, which decreases the density of Brnsted acid sites. The decrease in acid sites leads to a clear decrease in selectivity towards CO2 and an increased selectivity for C3H6.

5. **Mechanism of Action**: The proposed mechanism involves a Fe3+Fe2+ cycle operating on the extra-framework FeOAl site, which decomposes N2O to N2 and O2, demonstrating the catalyst's role in initiating the ODHP reaction.

6. **Comparative Performance**: Compared to cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts, iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP. However, definitive conclusions regarding their comparative performance are hindered by a lack of sufficient data.

7. **Framework Influence**: Other zeolite frameworks, such as MOR, FAU, and BEA, exhibit inferior catalytic performance compared to MFI zeolites. They possess lower C3H6 yields and are prone to fast deactivation. FAU and BEA zeolites show slightly better performance but still suffer from rapid deactivation. MOR and FER frameworks are much less active in the N2OODHP reaction, with very low C3H6 yields.

The synthesis methods impact the catalyst's structure, which in turn affects its activity, selectivity, and stability in the ODHP reaction. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 demonstrates superior performance, particularly in maintaining high C3H6 yields over extended periods, compared to other catalysts tested.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的各种合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，显著影响其在N2O辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。在不同反应条件下的关键性能指标包括：

1. **催化剂转化率**：蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5在450°C时的丙烷转化率为48%，表明了丙烷转化为更活泼中间体的程度。

2. **催化剂选择性**：该催化剂的N2O转化率达到96%，说明了其高效利用N2O作为反应物的能力。45%的丙烯选择性表明催化剂偏好生成丙烯而不是其他产物。

3. **催化剂产率**：通过固态离子交换或液体交换合成的Fe-ZSM-5，在377至527°C的温度范围内显示出丙烷转化率从20%到60%，丙烯选择性从25%到70%，以及丙烯产率从14%到30%。这些数字反映了催化剂在将丙烷转化为丙烯时的效率，同时产生最少的副产品。

4. **表征技术**：使用NH3TPD和XRD的研究显示，在Fe-ZSM-5的高温蒸汽预处理后，酸位浓度显著减少。这种减少归因于沸石的广泛铝化，导致Brnsted酸位密度下降。酸位数量的减少导致对CO2的选择性降低和C3H6选择性的增加。

5. **作用机制**：提出的机制涉及Fe3+Fe2+循环在额外框架FeOAl位点上进行，分解N2O为N2和O2，这表明催化剂在启动ODHP反应中的作用。

6. **比较性能**：与钴-和锰基ZSM-5催化剂相比，铁基ZSM-5催化剂在N2OODHP中的活性较低。然而，由于缺乏充分的数据，关于它们的比较性能的结论受到限制。

7. **框架影响**：其他沸石框架，如MOR、FAU和BEA，与MFI沸石相比表现出较差的催化性能。它们的C3H6产率较低，并且易于快速失效。FAU和BEA沸石仅略显更好的性能但仍遭受快速失效。MOR和FER框架在N2OODHP反应中表现非常低，C3H6产率极低。

合成方法影响催化剂的结构，进而影响其在ODHP反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性。与其它催化剂相比，蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5表现出卓越的性能，特别是在维持高C3H6产率方面。
