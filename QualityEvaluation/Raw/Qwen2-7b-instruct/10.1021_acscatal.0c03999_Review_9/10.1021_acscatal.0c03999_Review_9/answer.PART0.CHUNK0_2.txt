4.2.1. Metal-Modified Zeolites

In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts. (36,182,183,199,202,203)

Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C. (19,35,36,198,199,204)

The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP. (178,181,182)

Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites. (205207)

Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity.

On iron containing ZSM-5, studies report that FeOAl species are likely active sites for N2O-mediated ODHP. (19,35,36)

Further analyses with in situ DRIFTS and TPD reveal that reoxidation of the Fe2+OAl site with N2O forms an O species, which is thermally stable and highly selective in the target reaction.

Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. (180183)

Among the different zeolites tested, steam activated Fe-ZSM-5, with abundant extra-framework iron sites, presents the highest resistance to deactivation, and shows a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream.

There have only been a few reports where other metal-containing MFI catalysts such as cobalt or manganese have been tested for N2OODHP. (198,211)

While it is reported that both cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP than iron-containing ZSM-5, there are insufficient data to definitively draw assertion.

4.2.2. Effect of Zeolite Topology

FAU and BEA zeolites are the frameworks that show relatively better performance and are close to the MFI-based catalysts, with their highest C3H6 yields between 7% and 17%. (36,204)

However, the BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. (182,200)

MOR or FER frameworks are much less active in the N2OODHP reaction, exhibiting very low C3H6 yields (i.e., <2%). (36,204)

A summary of the catalytic performance of different zeolite catalysts is shown in Table 12.

1. Different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods lead to variations in C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. For instance, solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods result in C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% within the temperature range of 377 to 527 C.

2. Steam treatment of iron-containing zeolites positively impacts C3H6 yield and selectivity. This synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species, which are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP. After high-temperature steam pretreatment, there is a significant decrease in the acid site concentration, likely due to extensive dealumination of the zeolite and a decrease in Brnsted acid sites density.

3. Iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts show high initial catalytic performance but face a major drawback: deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. Steam activated Fe-ZSM-5 demonstrates the highest resistance to deactivation, maintaining a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream.

4. Cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP compared to iron-containing ZSM-5, but definitive assertions are lacking due to insufficient data. Stability or deactivation studies on these catalysts for N2OODHP are scarce.

5. Zeolite frameworks other than MFI, such as MOR and FER, exhibit significantly lower catalytic performance in the N2OODHP reaction, with very low C3H6 yields. FAU and BEA zeolites show better performance, but BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. The summarized activity performance of various framework zeolites for N2OODHP conversion is provided in Table 12.

1. 铁基负载ZSM-5的不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对其在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生影响。这些方法导致C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率的变化。例如，固态离子交换或液相交换方法导致C3H8转化率在377至527°C的温度范围内为20%至60%，C3H6选择性为25%至70%，C3H6产率为14%至30%。

2. 高温蒸汽预处理铁基负载沸石对C3H6产率和选择性有积极影响。这种合成方法产生了额外框架铁物种，对于N2OODHP比框架铁物种更为活性。经过高温蒸汽预处理后，酸中心浓度显著降低，可能由于沸石的大量铝去除以及Brnsted酸中心密度的下降。

3. 铁基负载ZSM-5催化剂表现出高初始催化性能，但面临一个主要问题：由焦炭引起的催化剂失活，导致C3H6产率迅速下降。高温蒸汽激活的Fe-ZSM-5显示出最高的失活抵抗力，其C3H6产率保持在20%以上，长达75分钟的反应时间。

4. 钴基和锰基负载ZSM-5催化剂在N2OODHP反应中比铁基负载ZSM-5活性较低，但缺乏确凿的结论，因为数据不足。这些催化剂在N2OODHP反应中的稳定性和失活研究很少见。

5. 除了MFI骨架之外的其他沸石骨架，如MOR和FER，在N2OODHP反应中的催化性能显著较低，C3H6产率非常低。FAU和BEA沸石显示较好的性能，但BEA沸石会迅速失活。N2OODHP转换的各框架沸石催化剂的总结性活动性能提供在表12中。
