4.2.1. Metal-Modified Zeolites
In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts.
An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C.
Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C.
The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity.
Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity.

4.2.2. Effect of Zeolite Topology
FAU and BEA zeolites are the frameworks that show relatively better performance and are close to the MFI-based catalysts, with their highest C3H6 yields between 7% and 17%.
However, the BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation.
MOR or FER frameworks are much less active in the N2OODHP reaction, exhibiting very low C3H6 yields (i.e., <2%).

1. Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions are C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Steam treatment has a positive effect on C3H6 yield and selectivity. Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, with C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity from 25% to 70%, and C3H6 yield from 14% to 30% within the temperature range of 377 to 527 C. Moreover, high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites enhances C3H6 yield and selectivity, while reducing selectivity towards CO2.

2. Different zeolite frameworks, including MOR, FAU, and BEA, have been explored for the N2OODHP reaction. However, the catalytic performance of most of these frameworks is inferior to MFI zeolites, showing lower C3H6 yields and faster deactivation. Among them, FAU and BEA zeolites exhibit relatively better performance, with their highest C3H6 yields between 7% and 17%. However, BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. MOR and FER frameworks are much less active in the N2OODHP reaction, exhibiting very low C3H6 yields below 2%.

1. 铁基ZSM-5型沸石的不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，显著影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化性能。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标在不同反应条件下的表现，显示了这些催化剂的有效性。高温蒸汽预处理对铁基沸石有积极的影响，提高了C3H6产率和选择性，同时减少了CO2的选择性。固态离子交换和液相交换方法也表现出良好的催化性能，C3H8转化率在377到527°C范围内从20%到60%，C3H6选择率从25%到70%，C3H6产率从14%到30%。此外，高温蒸汽预处理增强了铁基沸石的C3H6产率和选择性，同时降低了CO2的选择性。

2. 其他沸石骨架结构，如MOR、FAU和BEA，也被用于N2OODHP反应中。然而，这些骨架结构的催化性能远低于MFI沸石，显示出较低的C3H6产率和更快的失活速度。其中，FAU和BEA沸石表现相对较好，最高C3H6产率在7%至17%之间。然而，BEA沸石存在快速失活的问题。MOR和FER框架在N2OODHP反应中活性很低，C3H6产率非常低，低于2%。
