[1] "In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts."
[2] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."
[3] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."
[4] "Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites."
[5] "Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity."
[6] "The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP."
[7] "For samples without calcination (Fe-MFI-24G), NO adsorption results in a broad band at 1850 cm1, indicating mononitrosyl on ferrous ions in the straight channels of ZSM-5."
[8] "When samples are calcined at high temperatures, two strong bands at 1875 and 1890 cm1 are observed in the IR spectra. The band at 1875 cm1 corresponds to the mononitrosyl species on extra-framework Fe2+OAl sites; the other band at 1890 cm1 is assigned to the mononitrosyl species on isolated ferrous ions located on γ sites of the ZSM-5 structure."
[9] "As initial adsorption of NO on Fe-MFI-1173 results in the emergence of a band at 1875 cm1, it is hypothesized that both bands at 1810 and 1875 cm1 come from the same ferrous species, namely isolated extra-framework Fe2+OAl species."
[10] "An increase in C3H6 yield is observed as the calcination temperature rises from 600 C (Fe-MFI-24G-873) to 800 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1073), while the samples calcined at 800 (Fe-MFI-24G-1073) and 900 C (Fe-MFI-24G-1173) show similar highest C3H6 yields between 27% and 30%."
[11] "It is proposed that the isolated FeOAl site is the active center responsible for N2O-mediated ODHP reaction."
[12] "Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield."
[13] "An excellent correlation between the increase in coke formation and decrease in C3H6 yield is observed, and based on such correlation it is hypothesized that coke formation is responsible for deactivation of the catalysts during the reaction."
[14] "While the amount of coke formation and the C3H6 yield usually display a nice correlation, for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5, this is not the case."
[15] "It is hypothesized that the location of the coke is another important factor that affects the deactivation process."
[16] "Fe-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied for this reaction because of its superior performance."
[17] "While Fe-ZSM-5 has been extensively studied for this reaction because of its superior performance, studies of other frameworks are still limited."

1. Iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts for the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Studies show that iron-containing ZSM-5 synthesized by steam treatment exhibits a C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450°C. Synthesis methods such as solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange also deliver good catalytic performance, with C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% across a temperature range of 377 to 527°C. High-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites enhances C3H6 yield and selectivity, as it produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP. Characterization techniques like NH3TPD and XRD indicate a significant decrease in acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment, suggesting extensive dealumination of the zeolite and a decrease in Brnsted acid sites. Such pretreatment leads to a clear decrease in CO2 selectivity and an increase in C3H6 selectivity. The high-temperature steam pretreatment also positively affects C3H6 yield and selectivity by producing extra-framework iron species.

2. Different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence its catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction. Steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework results in C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450°C. Synthesis methods like solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange lead to C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% within a temperature range of 377 to 527°C. High-temperature steam pretreatment enhances C3H6 yield and selectivity, as it produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP.

3. Iron-containing ZSM-5 has been extensively studied for the N2O-assisted ODHP reaction due to its superior performance. Other frameworks, such as MOR, FAU, and BEA, have been reported for the N2OODHP reaction, but their catalytic performance is inferior to that of MFI zeolites, with lower C3H6 yield and faster deactivation.

1. 铁基的ZSM-5被认为是在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中最有效的催化剂之一。早期的研究表明，通过蒸汽处理异晶替换的沸石框架合成的铁基ZSM-5，在450°C时具有C3H8转化率48%，N2O转化率96%，以及C3H6选择性45%。不同的合成方法，如固态离子交换或液体交换，也表现出良好的催化性能，C3H8转化率在20%-60%之间，C3H6选择性在25%-70%之间，C3H6产率在14%-30%之间，温度范围为377-527°C。高温蒸汽预处理铁基沸石可以提高C3H6产率和选择性，因为它产生了比框架铁物种更活跃的额外框架铁物种，用于N2OODHP。NH3TPD和XRD等表征技术表明，高温蒸汽预处理后酸位浓度显著降低，可能是因为大量铝的去除导致了酸位密度的下降。这样的预处理导致CO2选择性的明显降低和C3H6选择性的增加。高温蒸汽预处理还可以通过产生额外框架铁物种来提高C3H6产率和选择性，从而增强C3H6产率和选择性。
