1. Different synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods affect the catalyst's ability to convert propane and nitrogen oxides (N2O) into propylene (C3H6) efficiently. Key performance metrics include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

2. Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized via steam treatment exhibit high catalytic performance, achieving C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450°C.

3. Syntheses of Fe-ZSM-5 through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods deliver good catalytic performance with C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% within the temperature range of 377 to 527°C.

4. High-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites leads to a significant decrease in acid site concentration due to extensive dealumination of the zeolite and a decrease in Brnsted acid sites density. This results in a reduction in CO2 selectivity while increasing C3H6 selectivity.

5. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 presents high resistance to deactivation, maintaining a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 minutes on stream compared to other catalysts.

6. The correlation between coke formation and decrease in C3H6 yield is observed across MFI, BEA, and silicate catalysts during the ODHP reaction. 

7. For ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5, the amount of coke formation and C3H6 yield do not show a typical correlation, suggesting the location of coke might impact deactivation differently.

1. 不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对铁基ZSM-5沸石催化剂在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生影响。这些方法会影响催化剂将丙烷和氮氧化物（N2O）高效转化为丙烯（C3H6）的能力。关键的性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率。

2. 经过蒸汽处理的铁基ZSM-5沸石，在450°C时表现出高催化性能，实现了48%的丙烷转化率、96%的N2O转化率和45%的丙烯选择性。

4. 高温蒸汽预处理铁基沸石导致酸位浓度显著下降，可能是由于大量铝的去除以及Brnsted酸位密度的降低所致。这导致CO2选择性的减少，同时提高了丙烯选择性。

5. 蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5表现出极高的抗失活能力，即使在连续流反应器中运行75分钟，其丙烯产率仍保持在20%以上，而其他催化剂则迅速失效。

6. 在ODHP反应过程中，MFI、BEA和硅酸盐催化剂的焦炭形成量与丙烯产率之间的相关性被观察到。

7. 对于ex-Fe-ZSM-5和ex-H-ZSM-5，焦炭形成量与丙烯产率之间的典型相关性不明显，表明焦炭的位置可能以不同的方式影响失活过程。

4.2.1. Metal-Modified Zeolites

In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts. (36,182,183,199,202,203)

Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C. (19,35,36,198,199,204)

The high-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites has a positive effect on the C3H6 yield and selectivity, as this synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species that are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP. (178,181,182)

Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites. (205207)

Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity.

On iron containing ZSM-5, studies report that FeOAl species are likely active sites for N2O-mediated ODHP. (19,35,36)

Further analyses with in situ DRIFTS and TPD reveal that reoxidation of the Fe2+OAl site with N2O forms an O species, which is thermally stable and highly selective in the target reaction.

Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. (180183)

Among the different zeolites tested, steam activated Fe-ZSM-5, with abundant extra-framework iron sites, presents the highest resistance to deactivation, and shows a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream.

There have only been a few reports where other metal-containing MFI catalysts such as cobalt or manganese have been tested for N2OODHP. (198,211)

While it is reported that both cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP than iron-containing ZSM-5, there are insufficient data to definitively draw assertion.

4.2.2. Effect of Zeolite Topology

FAU and BEA zeolites are the frameworks that show relatively better performance and are close to the MFI-based catalysts, with their highest C3H6 yields between 7% and 17%. (36,204)

However, the BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. (182,200)

MOR or FER frameworks are much less active in the N2OODHP reaction, exhibiting very low C3H6 yields (i.e., <2%). (36,204)

A summary of the catalytic performance of different zeolite catalysts is shown in Table 12.

1. Different synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods lead to variations in C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. For instance, solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods result in C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% within the temperature range of 377 to 527 C.

2. Steam treatment of iron-containing zeolites positively impacts C3H6 yield and selectivity. This synthetic method produces extra-framework iron species, which are more active than framework iron species for N2OODHP. After high-temperature steam pretreatment, there is a significant decrease in the acid site concentration, likely due to extensive dealumination of the zeolite and a decrease in Brnsted acid sites density.

3. Iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts show high initial catalytic performance but face a major drawback: deactivation by coke, which leads to a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield. Steam activated Fe-ZSM-5 demonstrates the highest resistance to deactivation, maintaining a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 min on stream.

4. Cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP compared to iron-containing ZSM-5, but definitive assertions are lacking due to insufficient data. Stability or deactivation studies on these catalysts for N2OODHP are scarce.

5. Zeolite frameworks other than MFI, such as MOR and FER, exhibit significantly lower catalytic performance in the N2OODHP reaction, with very low C3H6 yields. FAU and BEA zeolites show better performance, but BEA zeolites suffer from rapid deactivation. The summarized activity performance of various framework zeolites for N2OODHP conversion is provided in Table 12.

1. 铁基负载ZSM-5的不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对其在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生影响。这些方法导致C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率的变化。例如，固态离子交换或液相交换方法导致C3H8转化率在377至527°C的温度范围内为20%至60%，C3H6选择性为25%至70%，C3H6产率为14%至30%。

2. 高温蒸汽预处理铁基负载沸石对C3H6产率和选择性有积极影响。这种合成方法产生了额外框架铁物种，对于N2OODHP比框架铁物种更为活性。经过高温蒸汽预处理后，酸中心浓度显著降低，可能由于沸石的大量铝去除以及Brnsted酸中心密度的下降。

3. 铁基负载ZSM-5催化剂表现出高初始催化性能，但面临一个主要问题：由焦炭引起的催化剂失活，导致C3H6产率迅速下降。高温蒸汽激活的Fe-ZSM-5显示出最高的失活抵抗力，其C3H6产率保持在20%以上，长达75分钟的反应时间。

4. 钴基和锰基负载ZSM-5催化剂在N2OODHP反应中比铁基负载ZSM-5活性较低，但缺乏确凿的结论，因为数据不足。这些催化剂在N2OODHP反应中的稳定性和失活研究很少见。

5. 除了MFI骨架之外的其他沸石骨架，如MOR和FER，在N2OODHP反应中的催化性能显著较低，C3H6产率非常低。FAU和BEA沸石显示较好的性能，但BEA沸石会迅速失活。N2OODHP转换的各框架沸石催化剂的总结性活动性能提供在表12中。

1. 铁基的ZSM-5被认为是在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中最有效的催化剂之一。早期的研究表明，通过蒸汽处理异晶替换的沸石框架合成的铁基ZSM-5，在450°C时具有C3H8转化率48%，N2O转化率96%，以及C3H6选择性45%。不同的合成方法，如固态离子交换或液体交换，也表现出良好的催化性能，C3H8转化率在20%-60%之间，C3H6选择性在25%-70%之间，C3H6产率在14%-30%之间，温度范围为377-527°C。高温蒸汽预处理铁基沸石可以提高C3H6产率和选择性，因为它产生了比框架铁物种更活跃的额外框架铁物种，用于N2OODHP。NH3TPD和XRD等表征技术表明，高温蒸汽预处理后酸位浓度显著降低，可能是因为大量铝的去除导致了酸位密度的下降。这样的预处理导致CO2选择性的明显降低和C3H6选择性的增加。高温蒸汽预处理还可以通过产生额外框架铁物种来提高C3H6产率和选择性，从而增强C3H6产率和选择性。

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, significantly influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include:

1. **Catalyst Conversion**: Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 shows a C3H8 conversion of 48% at 450°C. This value indicates the extent of propane conversion to more reactive intermediates.

2. **Catalyst Selectivity**: The N2O conversion reached 96% under the same conditions, suggesting a high efficiency in utilizing N2O as a reagent. The C3H6 selectivity of 45% highlights the preference of the catalyst for producing propene over other products.

3. **Catalyst Yield**: Synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange, Fe-ZSM-5 displays a C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% across the temperature range of 377 to 527°C. These figures reflect the catalyst's efficiency in converting propane to propene with minimal side products.

4. **Characterization Techniques**: Studies employing NH3TPD and XRD show a notable reduction in acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5. This reduction is attributed to extensive dealumination of the zeolite, which decreases the density of Brnsted acid sites. The decrease in acid sites leads to a clear decrease in selectivity towards CO2 and an increased selectivity for C3H6.

5. **Mechanism of Action**: The proposed mechanism involves a Fe3+Fe2+ cycle operating on the extra-framework FeOAl site, which decomposes N2O to N2 and O2, demonstrating the catalyst's role in initiating the ODHP reaction.

6. **Comparative Performance**: Compared to cobalt- and manganese-containing ZSM-5 catalysts, iron-containing ZSM-5 catalysts are less active in N2OODHP. However, definitive conclusions regarding their comparative performance are hindered by a lack of sufficient data.

7. **Framework Influence**: Other zeolite frameworks, such as MOR, FAU, and BEA, exhibit inferior catalytic performance compared to MFI zeolites. They possess lower C3H6 yields and are prone to fast deactivation. FAU and BEA zeolites show slightly better performance but still suffer from rapid deactivation. MOR and FER frameworks are much less active in the N2OODHP reaction, with very low C3H6 yields.

The synthesis methods impact the catalyst's structure, which in turn affects its activity, selectivity, and stability in the ODHP reaction. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 demonstrates superior performance, particularly in maintaining high C3H6 yields over extended periods, compared to other catalysts tested.
