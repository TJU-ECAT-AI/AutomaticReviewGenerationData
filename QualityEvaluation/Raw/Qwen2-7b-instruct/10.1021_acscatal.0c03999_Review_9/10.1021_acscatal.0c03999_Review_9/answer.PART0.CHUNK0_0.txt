[1] "In particular, iron-containing ZSM-5 has been reported as one of the most effective catalysts."
[2] "An early work reported that iron-containing ZSM-5, synthesized by steam treatment of an isomorphously substituted zeolite framework, shows C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450 C."
[3] "Further studies show that Fe-ZSM-5 synthesized through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods also deliver good catalytic performance, showing C3H8 conversion between 20% and 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% in the temperature range of 377 to 527 C."
[4] "Combined with characterization techniques, such as NH3TPD and XRD, studies report a significant decrease in the acid site concentration after high-temperature steam pretreatment of Fe-ZSM-5, likely because of extensive dealumination of the zeolite and concomitant decrease in the density of Brnsted acid sites."
[5] "Such pretreated samples present a clear decrease in selectivity toward CO2, along with increased C3H6 selectivity."
[6] "Despite its high initial catalytic performance, a major drawback of iron-containing zeolites is deactivation by coke, which causes a rapid decrease in C3H6 yield."
[7] "A tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) coupled with GC analysis (Figure 19) performed on MFI, BEA, and silicate catalysts is used to illustrate how zeolite catalysts deactivates over time during ODHP reaction."
[8] "While the amount of coke formation and the C3H6 yield usually display a nice correlation, for ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5, this is not the case."

1. Different synthesis methods such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. These methods affect the catalyst's ability to convert propane and nitrogen oxides (N2O) into propylene (C3H6) efficiently. Key performance metrics include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield.

2. Iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized via steam treatment exhibit high catalytic performance, achieving C3H8 conversion of 48%, N2O conversion of 96%, and C3H6 selectivity of 45% at 450°C.

3. Syntheses of Fe-ZSM-5 through solid-state ion exchange or liquid exchange methods deliver good catalytic performance with C3H8 conversion ranging from 20% to 60%, C3H6 selectivity between 25% and 70%, and C3H6 yield between 14% and 30% within the temperature range of 377 to 527°C.

4. High-temperature steam pretreatment of iron-containing zeolites leads to a significant decrease in acid site concentration due to extensive dealumination of the zeolite and a decrease in Brnsted acid sites density. This results in a reduction in CO2 selectivity while increasing C3H6 selectivity.

5. Steam-activated Fe-ZSM-5 presents high resistance to deactivation, maintaining a C3H6 yield above 20% up to 75 minutes on stream compared to other catalysts.

6. The correlation between coke formation and decrease in C3H6 yield is observed across MFI, BEA, and silicate catalysts during the ODHP reaction. 

7. For ex-Fe-ZSM-5 and ex-H-ZSM-5, the amount of coke formation and C3H6 yield do not show a typical correlation, suggesting the location of coke might impact deactivation differently.

1. 不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液相交换，对铁基ZSM-5沸石催化剂在N2O辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生影响。这些方法会影响催化剂将丙烷和氮氧化物（N2O）高效转化为丙烯（C3H6）的能力。关键的性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、丙烯选择性和丙烯产率。

2. 经过蒸汽处理的铁基ZSM-5沸石，在450°C时表现出高催化性能，实现了48%的丙烷转化率、96%的N2O转化率和45%的丙烯选择性。

3. 通过固态离子交换或液相交换方法合成的Fe-ZSM-5，在377到527°C的温度范围内，丙烷转化率从20%到60%，丙烯选择性从25%到70%，丙烯产率从14%到30%，均表现出良好的催化性能。

4. 高温蒸汽预处理铁基沸石导致酸位浓度显著下降，可能是由于大量铝的去除以及Brnsted酸位密度的降低所致。这导致CO2选择性的减少，同时提高了丙烯选择性。

5. 蒸汽活化的Fe-ZSM-5表现出极高的抗失活能力，即使在连续流反应器中运行75分钟，其丙烯产率仍保持在20%以上，而其他催化剂则迅速失效。

6. 在ODHP反应过程中，MFI、BEA和硅酸盐催化剂的焦炭形成量与丙烯产率之间的相关性被观察到。

7. 对于ex-Fe-ZSM-5和ex-H-ZSM-5，焦炭形成量与丙烯产率之间的典型相关性不明显，表明焦炭的位置可能以不同的方式影响失活过程。
