[1] "As compared to the alumina support, differently structured SiO2 supports stabilise highly dispersed surface VOx species at higher vanadium loading."
[2] "C3H6 selectivity over V(g-Al2O3) materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[3] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[4] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species."
[5] "For weakly acidic supports like SiO2, highly dispersed surface VOx species perform similarly for vanadium surface densities up to 1 V/nm2."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Different methods can lead to variations in the distribution and stability of VOx species on the zeolite surface, impacting the reaction efficiency. Specifically, the use of N2O as an oxidizing agent improves C3H6 selectivity by reducing the reoxidation of the catalyst, leading to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction and spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. For supports like SiO2, which are weakly acidic, the performance of the catalyst can be optimized by ensuring that the surface is covered with well-dispersed VOx species, leading to comparable performance up to a vanadium surface density of 1 V/nm2.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固相离子交换和液相交换，对在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能有影响。表现指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标证明了不同方法的有效性。不同的方法会导致在沸石表面分布和稳定性VOx物种的变化，影响反应效率。特别是将N2O作为氧化剂使用，可以提高C3H6选择性，通过减少催化剂的重新氧化，导致催化剂活性增加，表面VOx物种的活性位点分离，有利于选择性氧化而非COx形成。对于像SiO2这样的弱酸性支持物，通过确保表面覆盖有分散均匀的VOx物种，可以优化催化剂性能，在1 V/nm2的范德华表面密度范围内达到相似的性能。
