[1] "The SBET values of V/MCM-41 and V/SiO2 materials do not strongly depend on vanadium loading up to 5 wt.%. For V/g-Al2O3 materials, such possible vanadium loading is, however,lower (1 wt.)."
[2] "The SBET values of V(11.2)/MCM-41, V(4.6)/g-Al2O3 and V(9.5)/g-Al2O3 are significantly lower than those of the other V/MCM-41 and V/g-Al2O3 catalytic materials indicating that the microstructure of MCM-41 and g-Al2O3 is influenced by the comparatively high loading of vanadium."
[3] "As compared to the alumina support differently structured SiO2 supports (amorphous silica and MCM-41) enable stabilisation of VOx species of lower degrees of polymerisation at higher vanadium loading."
[4] "The higher the ratio of the rates of propene desorption to oxidation of propene, the higher is propene selectivity."
[5] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity depends on the support material at similar vanadium surface densities. Strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3 ought to be fully covered by small VOx aggregates in order to achieve a high selectivity in ODP."
[6] "The improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Higher SBET values enable the stabilization of more dispersed VOx species, leading to improved C3H6 selectivity. The selectivity is also influenced by the support material's acidity, with strongly acidic supports promoting propene selectivity. The use of N2O as the oxidizing agent enhances propene selectivity by reducing catalyst reoxidation, thus decreasing the concentration of active surface lattice oxygen in VOx species and favoring selective oxidation over COx formation.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法对其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生影响。关键性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。更高的SBET值能够稳定更多的分散VOx物种，从而提高C3H6选择性。选择性还受到支持材料酸性的影响，强酸性支持物有助于提高丙烯选择性。使用N2O作为氧化剂可以增强丙烯选择性，通过减少催化剂的重新氧化，降低VOx物种表面活性氧的浓度，从而有利于选择性氧化而非COx形成。
