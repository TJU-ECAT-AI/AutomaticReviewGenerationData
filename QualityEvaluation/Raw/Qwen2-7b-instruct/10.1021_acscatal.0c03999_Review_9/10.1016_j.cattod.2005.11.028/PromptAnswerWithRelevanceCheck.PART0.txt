[1] "As compared to the alumina support, differently structured SiO2 supports stabilise highly dispersed surface VOx species at higher vanadium loading."
[2] "These species are more selective over the latter materials than over V/g-Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[4] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[5] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species."
[6] "Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study shows that the nature of VOx species, characterized by their dispersion, depends on the apparent surface density and the supporting material. High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable the stabilization of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loadings up to 5 wt.% compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3. This is due to the lower specific surface area of g-Al2O3. The apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction are influenced by vanadium surface densities, supporting material, and oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation. However, C3H6 selectivity is improved in the presence of N2O. Moreover, C3H6 selectivity depends on the support material at similar vanadium surface densities. Strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3 require complete coverage by small VOx aggregates to achieve high selectivity in ODP. For weakly acidic supports like SiO2, highly dispersed surface VOx species perform similarly for vanadium surface densities up to 1 V/nm2.

研究表明，VOx物种的性质，即它们的分散度，取决于其表面密度和支撑材料。高表面度的非晶态二氧化硅和MCM-41能够稳定高分散的表面VOx物种，直至5 wt.%的钒负载，而仅在1 wt.%的氧化铝上达到。这是因为氧化铝的特定表面面积较低。在氧化脱氢反应中，不同支持材料和氧化剂（O2或N2O）影响了表面密度、支持材料和催化性能的表观转率频率（TOF）。使用O2时的TOF高于使用N2O时，因为N2O的催化剂再氧化能力较低。然而，在N2O的存在下，丙烯选择性得到改善。此外，在相似的钒表面密度下，支持材料对丙烯选择性有影响。对于强酸性支持物如氧化铝，需要完全覆盖由小VOx团簇组成的表面以实现高选择性。对于弱酸性支持物如二氧化硅，在1 V/nm2的钒表面密度范围内，高度分散的表面VOx物种表现相似。

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. Different methods can lead to variations in the distribution and stability of VOx species on the zeolite surface, impacting the reaction efficiency. Specifically, the use of N2O as an oxidizing agent improves C3H6 selectivity by reducing the reoxidation of the catalyst, leading to an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction and spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species. For supports like SiO2, which are weakly acidic, the performance of the catalyst can be optimized by ensuring that the surface is covered with well-dispersed VOx species, leading to comparable performance up to a vanadium surface density of 1 V/nm2.

铁含量ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，包括蒸汽处理、固相离子交换和液相交换，对在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能有影响。表现指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标证明了不同方法的有效性。不同的方法会导致在沸石表面分布和稳定性VOx物种的变化，影响反应效率。特别是将N2O作为氧化剂使用，可以提高C3H6选择性，通过减少催化剂的重新氧化，导致催化剂活性增加，表面VOx物种的活性位点分离，有利于选择性氧化而非COx形成。对于像SiO2这样的弱酸性支持物，通过确保表面覆盖有分散均匀的VOx物种，可以优化催化剂性能，在1 V/nm2的范德华表面密度范围内达到相似的性能。

The nature and distribution of VOx species over differently structured vanadia-based catalysts affect their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The study reveals that highly dispersed surface VOx species are more selective over amorphous silica and MCM-41 supports compared to alumina supports. This selectivity is influenced by the oxidizing agent, with N2O leading to higher propene selectivity due to its less favorable reoxidation capabilities. Additionally, C3H6 selectivity depends on the support material, with strongly acidic supports like alumina requiring full coverage of small VOx aggregates to achieve high selectivity. The oxidizing agent, N2O, improves propene selectivity by decreasing the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen, favoring selective oxidation over COx formation.

在不同结构的范德催化剂上，VOx物种的性质和分布影响丙烷的氧化脱氢性能。研究表明，高度分散的表面VOx物种在非晶二氧化硅和MCM-41支持上比在氧化铝支持上更具有选择性。这种选择性受氧化剂的影响，使用N2O时，丙烯的选择性更高，因为N2O的再氧化能力不如O2。此外，丙烯的选择性取决于支持材料，强酸性材料如氧化铝需要完全覆盖小的VOx聚合物以实现高选择性。氧化剂N2O通过降低活性表面晶格氧的稳态浓度来提高丙烯的选择性，从而有利于选择性氧化而不是COx形成。
