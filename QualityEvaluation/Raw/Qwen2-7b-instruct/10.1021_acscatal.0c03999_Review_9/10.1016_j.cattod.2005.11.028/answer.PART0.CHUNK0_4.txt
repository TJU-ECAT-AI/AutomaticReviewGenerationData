[1] "The SBET values of V/MCM-41 and V/SiO2 materials do not strongly depend on vanadium loading up to 5 wt.%. For V/g- Al2O3 materials, such possible vanadium loading is, however,lower (1 wt.)."
[2] "The SBET values of V(11.2)/MCM-41, V(4.6)/g-Al2O3 and V(9.5)/g-Al2O3 are significantly lower than those of the other V/MCM-41 and V/g-Al2O3 catalytic materials indicating that the microstructure of MCM-41 and g-Al2O3 is influenced by the comparatively high loading of vanadium."
[3] "As compared to the alumina support differently structured SiO2 supports (amorphous silica and MCM-41) enable stabilisation of VOx species of lower degrees of polymerisation at higher vanadium loading."
[4] "The selectivity is, however, influenced by oxidising agents (O2 and N2O) being higher with N2O than with O2."
[5] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity is suggested to be a function of the rates of propene desorption and its consecutive oxidation."
[6] "This improving effect of N2O on propene selectivity is assumed to be due to the fact that catalyst reoxidation by N2O is less favourable than by O2."

The nature and distribution of VOx species over differently structured vanadia-based catalysts affect their performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The study reveals that highly dispersed surface VOx species are more selective over amorphous silica and MCM-41 supports compared to alumina supports. This selectivity is influenced by the oxidizing agent, with N2O leading to higher propene selectivity due to its less favorable reoxidation capabilities. Additionally, C3H6 selectivity depends on the support material, with strongly acidic supports like alumina requiring full coverage of small VOx aggregates to achieve high selectivity. The oxidizing agent, N2O, improves propene selectivity by decreasing the steady-state concentration of active surface lattice oxygen, favoring selective oxidation over COx formation.

在不同结构的范德催化剂上，VOx物种的性质和分布影响丙烷的氧化脱氢性能。研究表明，高度分散的表面VOx物种在非晶二氧化硅和MCM-41支持上比在氧化铝支持上更具有选择性。这种选择性受氧化剂的影响，使用N2O时，丙烯的选择性更高，因为N2O的再氧化能力不如O2。此外，丙烯的选择性取决于支持材料，强酸性材料如氧化铝需要完全覆盖小的VOx聚合物以实现高选择性。氧化剂N2O通过降低活性表面晶格氧的稳态浓度来提高丙烯的选择性，从而有利于选择性氧化而不是COx形成。
