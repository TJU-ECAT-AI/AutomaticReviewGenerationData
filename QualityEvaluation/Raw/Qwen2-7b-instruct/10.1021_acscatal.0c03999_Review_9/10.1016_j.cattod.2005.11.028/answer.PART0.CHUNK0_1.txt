1. Differently structured SiO2 supports stabilize highly dispersed surface VOx species at higher vanadium loading compared to alumina support. 
2. Applying N2O instead of O2 can tune the catalytic performance of supported vanadia-based catalysts.  
3. The selectivity of propene is influenced by the ratio of propene desorption rates to its oxidation rates.
4. The selectivity of C3H6 depends on the type of support material at similar vanadium surface densities.
5. For achieving high selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODP), strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3 should be fully covered by small VOx aggregates.

1. 不同结构的SiO2支持与氧化铝相比，能够在较高钒负载下稳定高分散表面VOx物种。
2. 将N2O作为替代O2应用，可以调整支持范德亚基催化剂的催化性能。
3. 丙烯的选择性受到丙烯脱附速率与氧化速率比率的影响。
4. 在相似的钒表面积密度下，C3H6选择性取决于支撑材料的类型。
5. 要实现高效的氧化脱氢（ODP），强酸性支持物如g-Al2O3应完全被小VOx簇覆盖。
