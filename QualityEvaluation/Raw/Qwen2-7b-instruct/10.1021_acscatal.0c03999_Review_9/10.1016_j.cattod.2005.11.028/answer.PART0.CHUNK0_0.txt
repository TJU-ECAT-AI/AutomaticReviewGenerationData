[1] "As compared to the alumina support, differently structured SiO2 supports stabilise highly dispersed surface VOx species at higher vanadium loading."
[2] "These species are more selective over the latter materials than over V/g-Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "C3H6 selectivity over V/g-Al2O3 materials is improved by covering the support fully with well-dispersed VOx species."
[4] "Additionally, C3H6 selectivity over all materials studied can be tuned by using an alternative oxidising agent (N2O)."
[5] "The improving effect of N2O on C3H6 selectivity is related to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation resulting in an increase in the degree of catalyst reduction, i.e. spatial separation of active lattice oxygen in surface VOx species."
[6] "Such separation favours selective oxidation over COx formation."

The study shows that the nature of VOx species, characterized by their dispersion, depends on the apparent surface density and the supporting material. High-surface amorphous SiO2 and MCM-41 enable the stabilization of highly dispersed surface VOx species at vanadium loadings up to 5 wt.% compared to only up to 1 wt.% on g-Al2O3. This is due to the lower specific surface area of g-Al2O3. The apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs) in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) reaction are influenced by vanadium surface densities, supporting material, and oxidizing agent (O2 or N2O). TOFs with O2 are higher than those with N2O due to the lower ability of N2O for catalyst reoxidation. However, C3H6 selectivity is improved in the presence of N2O. Moreover, C3H6 selectivity depends on the support material at similar vanadium surface densities. Strongly acidic supports like g-Al2O3 require complete coverage by small VOx aggregates to achieve high selectivity in ODP. For weakly acidic supports like SiO2, highly dispersed surface VOx species perform similarly for vanadium surface densities up to 1 V/nm2.

研究表明，VOx物种的性质，即它们的分散度，取决于其表面密度和支撑材料。高表面度的非晶态二氧化硅和MCM-41能够稳定高分散的表面VOx物种，直至5 wt.%的钒负载，而仅在1 wt.%的氧化铝上达到。这是因为氧化铝的特定表面面积较低。在氧化脱氢反应中，不同支持材料和氧化剂（O2或N2O）影响了表面密度、支持材料和催化性能的表观转率频率（TOF）。使用O2时的TOF高于使用N2O时，因为N2O的催化剂再氧化能力较低。然而，在N2O的存在下，丙烯选择性得到改善。此外，在相似的钒表面密度下，支持材料对丙烯选择性有影响。对于强酸性支持物如氧化铝，需要完全覆盖由小VOx团簇组成的表面以实现高选择性。对于弱酸性支持物如二氧化硅，在1 V/nm2的钒表面密度范围内，高度分散的表面VOx物种表现相似。
