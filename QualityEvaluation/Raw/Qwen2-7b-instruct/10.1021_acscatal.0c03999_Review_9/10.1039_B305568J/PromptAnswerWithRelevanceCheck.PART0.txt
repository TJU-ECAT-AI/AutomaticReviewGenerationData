[1] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with N2O using high partial reactant pressures."
[2] "Initial propene yields of 2124% at 773798 K are very similar to state-of-the-art catalysts based on V and Mo oxides with O2."
[3] "Over vanadia-based catalysts, N2O is a less effective oxidant than O2 to obtain high propene yields, corroborating the superior performance of FeMFI with N2O."
[4] "Another feature of FeMFI relates to the high propionaldehyde yield, since this product has been never observed in ODP over typical oxide systems."
[5] "Steam-activated FeMFI catalysts show rapid deactivation by coke, but the initial performance is completely recovered after oxygen pretreatment at 773 K."
[6] "The practical realization of this process in continuous mode can be accomplished using a configuration of two reactors in parallel with alternating reaction-regeneration."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites exhibit high efficiency in ODHP, demonstrating superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The key performance metrics indicate that steam-activated FeMFI zeolites can achieve initial propene yields of 21-24% at 773-798 K, which are comparable to those of state-of-the-art catalysts based on vanadium and molybdenum oxides using oxygen. These catalysts are particularly advantageous in ODHP reactions with N2O, as N2O is a less effective oxidant compared to oxygen for high propene yields. Moreover, the ODHP reaction over FeMFI zeolites results in the formation of propionaldehyde as a major oxygenate product, a feature not observed in reactions with typical oxide systems. While steam-activated FeMFI catalysts experience rapid deactivation due to coke formation, their initial performance can be fully restored through oxygen pretreatment at 773 K. The practical implementation of the ODHP process can be achieved through a configuration of two reactors in parallel with alternating reaction-regeneration.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的多种合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生影响。活化后的FeMFI沸石在ODHP反应中表现出高效性，证明了其在C3H8转化、N2O转化、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率方面的优越性能。关键性能指标显示，活化后的FeMFI沸石能够在773-798 K时实现初始丙烯产率21%-24%，这与基于钒和钼氧化物的催化剂使用氧气时的表现相当。这些催化剂在N2O辅助的ODHP反应中特别有优势，因为与氧气相比，N2O作为氧化剂获得高丙烯产率的效果较差。此外，在FeMFI沸石上进行的ODHP反应会形成丙酮醛为主要氧代产物，这是传统氧化物系统中未观察到的特性。虽然活化后的FeMFI催化剂由于焦炭形成而迅速失活，但通过在773 K下的氧气预处理可以完全恢复其初始性能。实施ODHP过程可以通过交替反应-再生的两个反应器并行配置来实现。

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, specifically steam treatment, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolites exhibit higher activity and selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite. Key performance metrics demonstrating their effectiveness include high yields of propene (up to 24%) and propionaldehyde (up to 6%) at temperatures ranging from 773 to 798 K. Steam treatment of FeZSM-5 leads to the presence of mesopores, which improves the transport of reactants and products, reducing deactivation by coke. FeZSM-5 is more active than Fe-silicalite due to the absence of iron association and the presence of iron clustering in the zeolite channels.

2. In comparison to vanadia-based catalysts, N2O is a less effective oxidant than O2 for obtaining high propene yields. FeMFI zeolites, however, display a unique feature of producing high yields of propionaldehyde, a product that has not been observed in ODHP reactions over typical oxide systems.

1. 铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理，影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能。蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石的活性和选择性高于Fe硅酸盐沸石。关键的性能指标证明其有效性包括在773至798 K的温度范围内丙烯（高达24%）和丙醛（高达6%）的高产率。对FeZSM-5的蒸汽处理导致微孔的存在，这改善了反应物和产物的运输，减少了焦炭的降解作用。与Fe-silicalite相比，FeZSM-5更活跃，原因是FeZSM-5中没有铁关联，并且存在铁簇集在沸石通道中。 

2. 与以氧为氧化剂的催化剂相比，N2O对于获得高丙烯产率来说效率较低。然而，FeMFI沸石具有独特的特性，可以产生高产率的丙醛，这是在典型的氧化物系统中的ODHP反应中未曾观察到的产品。

1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The steam-activated FeMFI zeolites show high yields of propene (up to 24%) and propionaldehyde (up to 6%) at 773-798 K.

2. The steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolite exhibits superior performance compared to Fe-silicalite in the ODHP reaction. The difference in performance between both catalysts is marginal when considering their constitution with respect to iron. Steam-activated Fe-silicalite does not show any sign of iron association, while significant iron clustering is observed in steam-activated FeZSM-5. This suggests that the markedly different nature and distribution of extraframework iron species in the steam-activated catalysts does not have a strong influence on the initial ODHP performance.

3. The steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolite shows a faster deactivation rate compared to Fe-silicalite, especially at 723 K. The presence of mesopores in FeZSM-5, due to dealumination upon steam treatment, contributes to its ability to reduce pore blocking by coke and improve the transport of reactants and products, thereby retarding deactivation.

1. 铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换，对其在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能有影响。关键的性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标在不同反应条件下的数据展示了其有效性。蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在773-798 K下表现出高达24%的丙烯产率和6%的丙酮醛产率。

2. 与Fe硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的表现更优。两者之间性能的差异在考虑到铁的构成时并不显著。蒸汽活化的Fe硅酸盐未显示任何铁的关联，而蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5中观察到显著的铁聚集体。这表明蒸汽活化催化剂中铁物种的明显不同性质和分布对初始ODHP性能的影响不大。

3. 与Fe硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石的失活速率较快，尤其是在723 K下。由于蒸汽处理导致的铝损失，FeZSM-5具有更多的微孔结构，这有助于减少焦炭堵塞孔道，并改善反应物和产物的传输，从而延缓失活。

Steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolites exhibit high initial propene yields up to 24% at 798 K, comparable to the best values reported over vanadium and molybdenum oxides with oxygen.

For instance, at all temperatures studied, propene was the primary olefin, with yields reaching 24% at 798 K. The data in Table 1 and Figure 1 show that FeZSM-5 is more active and selective than Fe-silicalite, while Fe-silicalite is prone to deactivation even at 723 K. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 displays significant iron clustering, contrasting with the uniform and well-isolated extraframework iron species in steam-activated Fe-silicalite.
