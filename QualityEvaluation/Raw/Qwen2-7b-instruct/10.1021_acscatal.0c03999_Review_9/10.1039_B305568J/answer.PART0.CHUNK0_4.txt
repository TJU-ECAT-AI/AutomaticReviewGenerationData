[1] "The reaction between C3H8 and N2O over steam-activated FeMFI zeolites leads to high yields towards propene (24%) and propionaldehyde (6%) at 773798 K."
[2] "Our strategy is to utilize the specificity of N2O as a monooxygen donor and the capability of determined Fe species in the zeolite for coordinating a-oxygen to develop efficient catalysts for valorisation of propane and N2O via oxidative conversions."
[3] "Initial propene yields up to 24% are comparable with the highest values reported over V and Mo oxides with O2."
[4] "In addition,remarkable yields towards propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been obtained."
[5] "FeZSM-5 is more active and selective than Fe-silicalite."
[6] "Over vanadium-based catalysts, N2O is a less effective oxidant than O2 to obtain high propene yields."
[7] "Another feature of FeMFI relates to the high propionaldehyde yield, since this product has been never observed in ODP over typical oxide systems."
[8] "Investiga- tions in such a system are on the way."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, including steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics, such as C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield, demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions. Specifically, steam-activated FeMFI zeolites exhibit high yields of propene (up to 24%) and propionaldehyde (up to 6%) at 773798 K, which are comparable to the best performances reported for vanadium and molybdenum oxides using oxygen. FeZSM-5 is more active and selective than Fe-silicalite in ODHP reactions with N2O. Moreover, FeMFI zeolites offer a unique feature of high propionaldehyde yield, which is not observed in typical oxide systems performing the same reaction. Further investigations in practical configurations are ongoing to optimize the process for continuous operation.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的不同合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换，对在氮气氧化脱氢化丙烷（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生了影响。关键性能指标，如丙烷转化率、氮气氧化物转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，在不同反应条件下证明了其有效性。具体而言，蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在773至98K下，丙烯产率高达24%，丙醇醛产率可达6%，与使用氧气的钒和钼氧化物的最佳表现相当。FeZSM-5在以氮气氧化物为助剂的丙烷氧化脱氢化反应中比Fe硅酸盐更具有活性和选择性。此外，FeMFI沸石在氮气氧化物辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢化反应中展现出一个独特的特性，即高丙醇醛产率，这是在典型的氧化物系统中进行相同反应时未观察到的。进一步的研究正在开展，旨在优化连续操作的系统配置。
