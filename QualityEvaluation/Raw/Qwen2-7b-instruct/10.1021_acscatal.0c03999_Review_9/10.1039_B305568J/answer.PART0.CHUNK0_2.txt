1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The steam-activated FeMFI zeolites show high yields of propene (up to 24%) and propionaldehyde (up to 6%) at 773-798 K.

2. The steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolite exhibits superior performance compared to Fe-silicalite in the ODHP reaction. The difference in performance between both catalysts is marginal when considering their constitution with respect to iron. Steam-activated Fe-silicalite does not show any sign of iron association, while significant iron clustering is observed in steam-activated FeZSM-5. This suggests that the markedly different nature and distribution of extraframework iron species in the steam-activated catalysts does not have a strong influence on the initial ODHP performance.

3. The steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolite shows a faster deactivation rate compared to Fe-silicalite, especially at 723 K. The presence of mesopores in FeZSM-5, due to dealumination upon steam treatment, contributes to its ability to reduce pore blocking by coke and improve the transport of reactants and products, thereby retarding deactivation.

1. 铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换，对其在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能有影响。关键的性能指标包括丙烷转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标在不同反应条件下的数据展示了其有效性。蒸汽活化的FeMFI沸石在773-798 K下表现出高达24%的丙烯产率和6%的丙酮醛产率。

2. 与Fe硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石在ODHP反应中的表现更优。两者之间性能的差异在考虑到铁的构成时并不显著。蒸汽活化的Fe硅酸盐未显示任何铁的关联，而蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5中观察到显著的铁聚集体。这表明蒸汽活化催化剂中铁物种的明显不同性质和分布对初始ODHP性能的影响不大。

3. 与Fe硅酸盐相比，蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石的失活速率较快，尤其是在723 K下。由于蒸汽处理导致的铝损失，FeZSM-5具有更多的微孔结构，这有助于减少焦炭堵塞孔道，并改善反应物和产物的传输，从而延缓失活。
