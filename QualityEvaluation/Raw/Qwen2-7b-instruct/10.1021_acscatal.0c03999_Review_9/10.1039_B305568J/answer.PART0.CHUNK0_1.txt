1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, specifically steam treatment, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolites exhibit higher activity and selectivity compared to Fe-silicalite. Key performance metrics demonstrating their effectiveness include high yields of propene (up to 24%) and propionaldehyde (up to 6%) at temperatures ranging from 773 to 798 K. Steam treatment of FeZSM-5 leads to the presence of mesopores, which improves the transport of reactants and products, reducing deactivation by coke. FeZSM-5 is more active than Fe-silicalite due to the absence of iron association and the presence of iron clustering in the zeolite channels.

2. In comparison to vanadia-based catalysts, N2O is a less effective oxidant than O2 for obtaining high propene yields. FeMFI zeolites, however, display a unique feature of producing high yields of propionaldehyde, a product that has not been observed in ODHP reactions over typical oxide systems.

1. 铁基ZSM-5沸石的合成方法，特别是蒸汽处理，影响其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能。蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石的活性和选择性高于Fe硅酸盐沸石。关键的性能指标证明其有效性包括在773至798 K的温度范围内丙烯（高达24%）和丙醛（高达6%）的高产率。对FeZSM-5的蒸汽处理导致微孔的存在，这改善了反应物和产物的运输，减少了焦炭的降解作用。与Fe-silicalite相比，FeZSM-5更活跃，原因是FeZSM-5中没有铁关联，并且存在铁簇集在沸石通道中。 

2. 与以氧为氧化剂的催化剂相比，N2O对于获得高丙烯产率来说效率较低。然而，FeMFI沸石具有独特的特性，可以产生高产率的丙醛，这是在典型的氧化物系统中的ODHP反应中未曾观察到的产品。
