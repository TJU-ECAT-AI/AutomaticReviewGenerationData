1. The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, impact their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 zeolites exhibit high initial propene yields up to 24% at 798 K, comparable to the best values reported over vanadium and molybdenum oxides with oxygen. Additionally, remarkable yields towards propionaldehyde (up to 6%) have been achieved. The steam-activated zeolites' performance is demonstrated through the values in Table 1 and Figure 1.

2. The performance metrics that demonstrate the effectiveness of these catalysts under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. For instance, at all temperatures studied, propene was the primary olefin, with yields reaching 24% at 798 K. The data in Table 1 and Figure 1 show that FeZSM-5 is more active and selective than Fe-silicalite, while Fe-silicalite is prone to deactivation even at 723 K. Steam-activated FeZSM-5 displays significant iron clustering, contrasting with the uniform and well-isolated extraframework iron species in steam-activated Fe-silicalite.

1. 铁基ZSM-5沸石通过蒸汽处理、固体离子交换和液体交换等合成方法，在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的催化性能受到影响。蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5沸石在798 K时的初始丙烯产率达到24%，与使用氧气的钼和钒氧化物的最高报告值相当。此外，还获得了高达6%的丙酮醛产率。表1和图1以及表1和图1显示了这些催化剂在不同反应条件下的性能。

2. 表征这些催化剂有效性的性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率。例如，在所有研究的温度下，丙烯是主要的烯烃，产率达到24%在798 K。表1和图1表明，FeZSM-5比Fe硅酸盐沸石更活跃且选择性更高，而Fe硅酸盐沸石即使在723 K时也容易失活。蒸汽活化的FeZSM-5显示出显著的铁聚集体，与蒸汽活化的Fe硅酸盐沸石中均匀且隔离良好的额外框架铁物种形成对比。
