[1] "Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites are highly efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 with N2O using high partial reactant pressures."

[3] "Over vanadia-based catalysts, N2O is a less effective oxidant than O2 to obtain high propene yields, corroborating the superior performance of FeMFI with N2O."
[4] "Another feature of FeMFI relates to the high propionaldehyde yield, since this product has been never observed in ODP over typical oxide systems."
[5] "Steam-activated FeMFI catalysts show rapid deactivation by coke, but the initial performance is completely recovered after oxygen pretreatment at 773 K."

The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Steam-activated FeMFI zeolites exhibit high efficiency in ODHP, demonstrating superior performance in terms of C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The key performance metrics indicate that steam-activated FeMFI zeolites can achieve initial propene yields of 21-24% at 773-798 K, which are comparable to those of state-of-the-art catalysts based on vanadium and molybdenum oxides using oxygen. These catalysts are particularly advantageous in ODHP reactions with N2O, as N2O is a less effective oxidant compared to oxygen for high propene yields. Moreover, the ODHP reaction over FeMFI zeolites results in the formation of propionaldehyde as a major oxygenate product, a feature not observed in reactions with typical oxide systems. While steam-activated FeMFI catalysts experience rapid deactivation due to coke formation, their initial performance can be fully restored through oxygen pretreatment at 773 K. The practical implementation of the ODHP process can be achieved through a configuration of two reactors in parallel with alternating reaction-regeneration.

铁基ZSM-5沸石的多种合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，对其在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能产生影响。活化后的FeMFI沸石在ODHP反应中表现出高效性，证明了其在C3H8转化、N2O转化、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率方面的优越性能。关键性能指标显示，活化后的FeMFI沸石能够在773-798 K时实现初始丙烯产率21%-24%，这与基于钒和钼氧化物的催化剂使用氧气时的表现相当。这些催化剂在N2O辅助的ODHP反应中特别有优势，因为与氧气相比，N2O作为氧化剂获得高丙烯产率的效果较差。此外，在FeMFI沸石上进行的ODHP反应会形成丙酮醛为主要氧代产物，这是传统氧化物系统中未观察到的特性。虽然活化后的FeMFI催化剂由于焦炭形成而迅速失活，但通过在773 K下的氧气预处理可以完全恢复其初始性能。实施ODHP过程可以通过交替反应-再生的两个反应器并行配置来实现。
