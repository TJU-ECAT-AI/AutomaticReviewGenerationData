1. The application of iron zeolites in various catalytic reactions with different mechanisms is an essential aspect that needs to be analyzed, but has not been sufficiently emphasized in the literature.

2. The intrinsic reaction mechanism of the catalytic process determines the optimal distribution of iron sites, which can be adjusted by controlling the steaming temperature during the activation process.

3. In the context of direct N2O decomposition, oligonuclear iron oxo clusters in the zeolite channels are crucial because they allow for faster desorption of O2 compared to isolated iron ions.

4. Zeolites that contain a more consistent distribution of isolated iron species tend to exhibit higher activity in the N2O reduction process with CO, compared to catalysts with a high degree of clustering.

5. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a dual role, promoting direct N2O decomposition while inhibiting the reduction of N2O with CO, which supports the involvement of different iron sites in both types of conversions.

6. Direct N2O decomposition is more efficiently catalyzed by iron sites with oligonuclear iron oxo clusters, rather than isolated iron ions.

7. When reducing agents such as CO are present, the removal of oxygen as CO2 occurs at a much faster rate compared to the direct decomposition of N2O.

8. In the process of N2O reduction with CO, isolated iron ions predominantly act as the active sites, contributing significantly to the reaction.

1. 铁沸石在不同机制的催化反应中的应用是一个需要分析的关键方面，但文献中对此强调不足。

2. 催化过程的内在反应机制决定了最优铁位点分布，可以通过调节激活过程中蒸汽处理的温度进行调整。

3. 在直接N2O分解过程中，位于沸石通道中的寡核铁氧簇至关重要，因为它们允许更快地释放O2，与孤立的铁离子相比。

4. 分布均匀的孤立铁物种含量较高的沸石在CO辅助下对N2O还原表现出更高的活性，与高度聚集体催化剂相比。

5. 硝酸盐（NO）在直接促进N2O分解和抑制CO辅助下的N2O还原之间发挥着双重作用，支持两种类型转化中不同铁位点的参与。

6. 直接N2O分解更高效地由具有寡核铁氧簇的铁位点催化，而不是孤立的铁离子。

7. 当存在还原剂如CO时，氧气作为CO2的去除速率远高于直接N2O分解。

8. 在CO辅助的N2O还原过程中，孤立的铁离子主要作为活性位点，对反应贡献显著。
