Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The nature of the active iron site(s) plays a crucial role in these processes, with the intrinsic reaction mechanism determining the optimal iron site distribution. This distribution can be modulated by adjusting the steaming temperature during activation. Oligonuclear iron oxo clusters in the zeolite channels are essential for direct N2O decomposition, offering faster O2 desorption compared to isolated ions. Lower steaming temperatures enable the formation of these clusters in FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI catalysts, while a more uniform distribution of isolated iron species leads to higher activities in N2O reduction with CO. The presence of NO acts as a promoter in N2O decomposition and an inhibitor in N2O reduction, indicating the involvement of different iron sites in both conversion processes. NO selectively inhibits N2O reduction over isolated iron ions, highlighting the critical role of oligonuclear iron clusters in NO-assisted N2O decomposition.

各种合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固相离子交换和液体交换，会影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。关键的性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标在不同反应条件下的表现证明了它们的有效性。活性铁位的性质在这些过程中起着至关重要的作用，内在反应机制决定了最佳铁位分布。通过调整激活过程中的蒸馏温度可以调节这种分布。在ZSM-5沸石的通道中，寡核铁氧簇对于直接N2O分解至关重要，提供更快的O2脱附与孤立离子相比。较低的蒸馏温度允许在FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI催化剂中形成这些簇，而孤立铁物种的更均匀分布导致了N2O与CO反应时更高的活性。NO作为N2O分解的促进剂和N2O还原的抑制剂，在两种转化过程中都参与了不同的铁位。NO选择性地抑制孤立铁离子上的N2O还原，强调了寡核铁簇在NO辅助N2O分解中的关键作用。
