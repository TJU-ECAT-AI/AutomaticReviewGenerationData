The origin of the catalytic activity in iron zeolites, especially in the FeMFI system, has been debated for a decade. Iron ions in tetrahedral framework positions and large iron oxide particles on the zeolite surface are generally inactive. The catalytic activity is usually attributed to extraframework species within the zeolite pores. Two types of active iron sites have been identified: isolated iron ions and oligonuclear iron clusters. Determining the unified active site for all iron zeolite-catalyzed conversions is challenging due to the complex nature of iron species in the zeolite. A critical aspect that has not been highlighted involves the application of iron zeolites in various catalytic reactions with different mechanisms.

铁沸石，特别是FeMFI系统，催化活性的起源在过去十年中一直存在争议。四面体框架位置的铁离子和表面的大铁氧化物颗粒通常被认为是无活性的。催化活性通常归因于位于沸石孔内的额外框架物种。已识别出两种活性铁位：孤立的铁离子和寡核铁氧簇。将所有铁沸石催化转化反应中的统一活性位点统一定义是复杂的，因为沸石中的铁物种具有复杂的性质。一个关键方面在文献中没有被强调，即铁沸石在具有不同机制的各种催化反应中的应用。

[1] "The mechanism of iron extraction by steaming in isomorphously substituted iron zeolites is far from being a simple and completely understood process."
[2] "In a simplified way, it can be considered as a clustering process as schematically shown in Fig. 4, whose extent basically depends on the steaming conditions and composition of the zeolite framework."
[3] "The activation temperature should be carefully adjusted to achieve the optimal distribution of iron species, achieving the extraction of inactive framework iron but preventing extensive clustering into inactive iron oxide particles."
[4] "The results in Fig. 1 unequivocally show that the conversion of the four steamed zeolites in direct N2O decomposition is very close, provided that the samples are properly activated."
[5] "Under the optimal activation conditions, both groups of zeolites investigated show a certain degree of iron association, characterized by a substantial amount of oligonuclear iron oxo clusters."

铁沸石同晶替换过程中的铁提取机制远非简单且完全理解。简化来说，这是一个聚集体过程，如图4所示，其程度主要取决于蒸气处理条件和沸石框架组成。激活温度应谨慎调整以实现最佳的铁物种分布，既提取了无活性的框架铁，又防止了大量形成无活性的铁氧化物颗粒。结果表明，在图1所示条件下，四种蒸煮沸石直接N2O分解的转换非常接近，前提是样品正确激活。在最优激活条件下，研究的两组沸石都表现出一定的铁关联，特征为大量寡核铁氧簇。

[1] "The combination of zeolites with different lattice compositions and activation conditions with characterization and steady-state activity results enables us to conclude that the zeolites with a larger fraction of extraframework isolated iron ions are less active in direct N2O decomposition than those with a larger fraction of oligonuclear clusters."
[2] "Clustering was largely minimized in FeGeMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (873 K), and the majority of iron is in the form of isolated ions."
[3] "These results evidence the extreme difficulty in achieving a uniform distribution of a certain iron site in Fe zeolites, although the distribution of iron species can be to some extent tailored by carefully adjusting the activation conditions."

结合具有不同框架结构和激活条件的沸石以及表征和稳态活性结果，我们得出结论：含有更多额外框架孤立铁离子的沸石在直接N2O分解中的活性低于含有更多寡核簇的沸石。在FeGeMFI（873 K）和FeMFI（873 K）中，聚集体被大量减少，大部分铁以孤立离子形式存在。这些结果证明了在Fe沸石中实现特定铁位均匀分布的极端困难性，尽管通过仔细调整激活条件可以在一定程度上调整铁物种的分布。

The intrinsic mechanism of various N2O conversions over FeMFI catalysts is closely related to the nature of the active iron site(s). The optimal iron site distribution can be adjusted by modifying the steaming temperature during activation. Oligonuclear iron oxo clusters play a crucial role in direct N2O decomposition due to their ability to facilitate faster oxygen desorption compared to isolated ions. Zeolites with a more even distribution of isolated iron species exhibit higher activity in N2O reduction with CO compared to highly clustered catalysts. NO acts as a promoter in N2O decomposition and an inhibitor in N2O reduction, suggesting the involvement of distinct iron sites in both conversion types. The complexity in unifying the various interpretations regarding the active sites stems from the inherent heterogeneity of iron species within the zeolite structure.

各种N2O转化的内在机制与FeMFI催化剂中活性铁位点的性质密切相关。通过调整激活过程中的蒸气温度可以调整最佳铁位分布。在直接N2O分解过程中，寡核态铁氧簇起着关键作用，因为它们能够促进更快的氧气释放，相较于孤立离子而言。具有更均匀分布的孤立铁物种的沸石在与CO进行N2O还原时表现出更高的活性，与高度聚集体催化剂相比。NO作为促进剂在N2O分解中发挥作用，并且作为抑制剂抑制N2O与CO的还原，这进一步支持了两种转化类型中不同位点的参与。在统一各种解释中关于活性位点的复杂性来自于沸石结构内铁物种固有的异质性。

1. The application of iron zeolites in various catalytic reactions with different mechanisms is an essential aspect that needs to be analyzed, but has not been sufficiently emphasized in the literature.

2. The intrinsic reaction mechanism of the catalytic process determines the optimal distribution of iron sites, which can be adjusted by controlling the steaming temperature during the activation process.

3. In the context of direct N2O decomposition, oligonuclear iron oxo clusters in the zeolite channels are crucial because they allow for faster desorption of O2 compared to isolated iron ions.

4. Zeolites that contain a more consistent distribution of isolated iron species tend to exhibit higher activity in the N2O reduction process with CO, compared to catalysts with a high degree of clustering.

5. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a dual role, promoting direct N2O decomposition while inhibiting the reduction of N2O with CO, which supports the involvement of different iron sites in both types of conversions.

6. Direct N2O decomposition is more efficiently catalyzed by iron sites with oligonuclear iron oxo clusters, rather than isolated iron ions.

7. When reducing agents such as CO are present, the removal of oxygen as CO2 occurs at a much faster rate compared to the direct decomposition of N2O.

8. In the process of N2O reduction with CO, isolated iron ions predominantly act as the active sites, contributing significantly to the reaction.

Various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. Key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. The nature of the active iron site(s) plays a crucial role in these processes, with the intrinsic reaction mechanism determining the optimal iron site distribution. This distribution can be modulated by adjusting the steaming temperature during activation. Oligonuclear iron oxo clusters in the zeolite channels are essential for direct N2O decomposition, offering faster O2 desorption compared to isolated ions. Lower steaming temperatures enable the formation of these clusters in FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI catalysts, while a more uniform distribution of isolated iron species leads to higher activities in N2O reduction with CO. The presence of NO acts as a promoter in N2O decomposition and an inhibitor in N2O reduction, indicating the involvement of different iron sites in both conversion processes. NO selectively inhibits N2O reduction over isolated iron ions, highlighting the critical role of oligonuclear iron clusters in NO-assisted N2O decomposition.

各种合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固相离子交换和液体交换，会影响铁基ZSM-5沸石在丙烷氧化脱氢（ODHP）反应中的催化性能。关键的性能指标包括C3H8转化率、N2O转化率、C3H6选择性和C3H6产率，这些指标在不同反应条件下的表现证明了它们的有效性。活性铁位的性质在这些过程中起着至关重要的作用，内在反应机制决定了最佳铁位分布。通过调整激活过程中的蒸馏温度可以调节这种分布。在ZSM-5沸石的通道中，寡核铁氧簇对于直接N2O分解至关重要，提供更快的O2脱附与孤立离子相比。较低的蒸馏温度允许在FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI催化剂中形成这些簇，而孤立铁物种的更均匀分布导致了N2O与CO反应时更高的活性。NO作为N2O分解的促进剂和N2O还原的抑制剂，在两种转化过程中都参与了不同的铁位。NO选择性地抑制孤立铁离子上的N2O还原，强调了寡核铁簇在NO辅助N2O分解中的关键作用。
