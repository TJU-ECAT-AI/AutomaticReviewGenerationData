The origin of the catalytic activity in iron zeolites, especially in the FeMFI system, has been debated for a decade. Iron ions in tetrahedral framework positions and large iron oxide particles on the zeolite surface are generally inactive. The catalytic activity is usually attributed to extraframework species within the zeolite pores. Two types of active iron sites have been identified: isolated iron ions and oligonuclear iron clusters. Determining the unified active site for all iron zeolite-catalyzed conversions is challenging due to the complex nature of iron species in the zeolite. A critical aspect that has not been highlighted involves the application of iron zeolites in various catalytic reactions with different mechanisms.

铁沸石，特别是FeMFI系统，催化活性的起源在过去十年中一直存在争议。四面体框架位置的铁离子和表面的大铁氧化物颗粒通常被认为是无活性的。催化活性通常归因于位于沸石孔内的额外框架物种。已识别出两种活性铁位：孤立的铁离子和寡核铁氧簇。将所有铁沸石催化转化反应中的统一活性位点统一定义是复杂的，因为沸石中的铁物种具有复杂的性质。一个关键方面在文献中没有被强调，即铁沸石在具有不同机制的各种催化反应中的应用。

[1] "The mechanism of iron extraction by steaming in isomorphously substituted iron zeolites is far from being a simple and completely understood process."
[2] "In a simplified way, it can be considered as a clustering process as schematically shown in Fig. 4, whose extent basically depends on the steaming conditions and composition of the zeolite framework."
[3] "The activation temperature should be carefully adjusted to achieve the optimal distribution of iron species, achieving the extraction of inactive framework iron but preventing extensive clustering into inactive iron oxide particles."
[4] "The results in Fig. 1 unequivocally show that the conversion of the four steamed zeolites in direct N2O decomposition is very close, provided that the samples are properly activated."
[5] "Under the optimal activation conditions, both groups of zeolites investigated show a certain degree of iron association, characterized by a substantial amount of oligonuclear iron oxo clusters."

铁沸石同晶替换过程中的铁提取机制远非简单且完全理解。简化来说，这是一个聚集体过程，如图4所示，其程度主要取决于蒸气处理条件和沸石框架组成。激活温度应谨慎调整以实现最佳的铁物种分布，既提取了无活性的框架铁，又防止了大量形成无活性的铁氧化物颗粒。结果表明，在图1所示条件下，四种蒸煮沸石直接N2O分解的转换非常接近，前提是样品正确激活。在最优激活条件下，研究的两组沸石都表现出一定的铁关联，特征为大量寡核铁氧簇。

[1] "The combination of zeolites with different lattice compositions and activation conditions with characterization and steady-state activity results enables us to conclude that the zeolites with a larger fraction of extraframework isolated iron ions are less active in direct N2O decomposition than those with a larger fraction of oligonuclear clusters."
[2] "Clustering was largely minimized in FeGeMFI (873 K) and FeMFI (873 K), and the majority of iron is in the form of isolated ions."
[3] "These results evidence the extreme difficulty in achieving a uniform distribution of a certain iron site in Fe zeolites, although the distribution of iron species can be to some extent tailored by carefully adjusting the activation conditions."

结合具有不同框架结构和激活条件的沸石以及表征和稳态活性结果，我们得出结论：含有更多额外框架孤立铁离子的沸石在直接N2O分解中的活性低于含有更多寡核簇的沸石。在FeGeMFI（873 K）和FeMFI（873 K）中，聚集体被大量减少，大部分铁以孤立离子形式存在。这些结果证明了在Fe沸石中实现特定铁位均匀分布的极端困难性，尽管通过仔细调整激活条件可以在一定程度上调整铁物种的分布。
