The intrinsic mechanism of various N2O conversions over FeMFI catalysts is closely related to the nature of the active iron site(s). The optimal iron site distribution can be adjusted by modifying the steaming temperature during activation. Oligonuclear iron oxo clusters play a crucial role in direct N2O decomposition due to their ability to facilitate faster oxygen desorption compared to isolated ions. Zeolites with a more even distribution of isolated iron species exhibit higher activity in N2O reduction with CO compared to highly clustered catalysts. NO acts as a promoter in N2O decomposition and an inhibitor in N2O reduction, suggesting the involvement of distinct iron sites in both conversion types. The complexity in unifying the various interpretations regarding the active sites stems from the inherent heterogeneity of iron species within the zeolite structure.

各种N2O转化的内在机制与FeMFI催化剂中活性铁位点的性质密切相关。通过调整激活过程中的蒸气温度可以调整最佳铁位分布。在直接N2O分解过程中，寡核态铁氧簇起着关键作用，因为它们能够促进更快的氧气释放，相较于孤立离子而言。具有更均匀分布的孤立铁物种的沸石在与CO进行N2O还原时表现出更高的活性，与高度聚集体催化剂相比。NO作为促进剂在N2O分解中发挥作用，并且作为抑制剂抑制N2O与CO的还原，这进一步支持了两种转化类型中不同位点的参与。在统一各种解释中关于活性位点的复杂性来自于沸石结构内铁物种固有的异质性。
