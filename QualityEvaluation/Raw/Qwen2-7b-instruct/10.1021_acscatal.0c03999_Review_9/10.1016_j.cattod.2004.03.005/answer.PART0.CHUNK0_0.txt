[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes. With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[2] "With N2O, molybdenum in NiMoO4 works in a slightly more reduced state (XPS: presence of Mo5+). Under these conditions, the catalyst is more selective."
[3] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
[4] "The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2."
[5] "According to the XPS results, there is an enrichment in low BE oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present."

1. The presence of gas dopes like N2O and CO2 modifies the selective sites during the oxidation reactions. N2O increases the selectivity for propylene, while decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen and the yield of CO2. It also promotes the reduction of molybdenum in NiMoO4, making the catalyst more selective. Sb2O4 also influences the selectivity by controlling the number of selective sites.
2. CO2 allows the catalytic combustion of methane to start at lower temperatures, enriching the ceria-zirconia compound with low BE oxygen species when present.

1. 气体添加剂如N2O和CO2改变了氧化反应中的选择性位点。N2O提高了丙烯的选择性，同时降低了丙烷和氧气的转化率以及CO2的产率。它还能促进NiMoO4中钼的还原，使催化剂更具选择性。Sb2O4也通过控制活性位点的数量影响了选择性。
2. CO2允许甲烷的催化燃烧在更低的温度下开始，当存在时，会使铈锆复合氧化物化合物富含低能级氧物种。
