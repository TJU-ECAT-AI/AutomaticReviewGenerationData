<p>With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum.</p>
<p>CO2 promotes total oxidation of methane. The dissociation of CO2 seems to be responsible for this promotion.</p>
<p>The adjustment of the concentration of N2O and CO2 thus clearly appears as a promising tool to improve the selectivity of partial oxidation products and the energetic efficiency in combustion.</p>
<p>Previous studies demonstrated that, working with pure molybdenum oxide (MoO3), the key to maintaining high catalytic performances (high selectivity in partial oxidation, low formation of CO2) is to stabilise the surface of molybdenum oxide in a sub-oxide close to the sto- ichiometry of Mo18O52. This reduced state can be obtained when -Sb2O4 is present in contact with MoO3.</p>
<p>In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4.</p>
<p>The presence of some CO2 in the feed allows the reaction of catalytic combustion of methane, on palladium supported on ceria-zirconia mixed oxide catalysts, starting at lower temperatures than what is observed in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>According to the XPS results, there is an enrichment in low BE oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present.</p>

The document discusses the effects of nitrogen dioxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) on the catalytic performance of certain metal oxide catalysts in oxidative reactions. N2O tends to reduce the selectivity of propylene production, decrease the conversion of propane and oxygen, and lower the yield of CO2. It promotes the reduction of molybdenum in the catalyst. On the other hand, CO2 enhances the total oxidation of methane, with its dissociation being the likely cause. The introduction of N2O and CO2 at appropriate concentrations offers a promising method to improve the selectivity of partial oxidation products and the energy efficiency of combustion processes.

The document also explores the role of antimony oxide (-Sb2O4) in controlling the number of active sites on the surface of catalysts during oxidation reactions, which affects the selectivity of products. It explains that maintaining the surface of molybdenum oxide in a reduced state near the stoichiometry of Mo18O52 can enhance selectivity and reduce CO2 formation, achievable through the presence of -Sb2O4 or by adding N2O to the feed.

In catalytic combustion of methane, the presence of CO2 lowers the activation temperature needed for the reaction to occur, possibly due to the creation of active oxygen species upon the dissociation of CO2 at the catalyst surface. The XPS results indicate an increase in low binding energy oxygen species in the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present, suggesting that these oxygen species might facilitate the oxidation of methane by altering the catalyst's activity and oxidation state.

In summary, the document outlines how N2O and CO2 can be used to tune the oxidation state of catalysts and potentially improve their performance in oxidative reactions, including catalytic combustion of methane, by adjusting the selectivity and energy efficiency of the processes.

文献讨论了氮氧化物（N2O）和二氧化碳（CO2）在氧化反应中某些金属氧化物催化剂的催化性能的影响。N2O倾向于降低丙烯选择性，减少丙烷和氧气的转化率，并降低二氧化碳的产率。它促进钼的还原。另一方面，CO2增强甲烷的完全氧化，其解离可能是这一促进的原因。在适当的浓度下引入N2O和CO2提供了一种改进部分氧化产物选择性和燃烧过程能效的有前景的方法。

文献还探讨了硫化锑（-Sb2O4）在氧化反应期间控制催化剂表面活性位点数量的作用，这影响产品的选择性。它解释说，通过保持钼氧化物表面在接近Mo18O52的化学计量比的还原状态可以增强选择性和减少二氧化碳的生成，这可以通过-Sb2O4的存在或向反应气体中添加N2O实现。

在甲烷催化燃烧过程中，CO2的存在降低了反应开始所需的激活温度，可能是因为CO2在催化剂表面解离产生活性氧物种。XPS结果表明，在存在CO2时，铈锆混合氧化物化合物中的低结合能氧物种增加，暗示这些氧物种可能通过改变催化剂的活性和氧化状态来促进甲烷的氧化。

总之，文献概述了如何通过调整氧化状态来利用N2O和CO2来优化催化剂在氧化反应中的性能，包括甲烷催化燃烧，从而通过调整选择性和能效来改善这些过程。
