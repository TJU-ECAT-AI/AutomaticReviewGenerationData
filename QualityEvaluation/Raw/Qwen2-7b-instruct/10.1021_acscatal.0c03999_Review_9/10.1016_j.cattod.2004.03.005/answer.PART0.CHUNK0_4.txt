[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes."
[2] "With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases."
[3] "N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum."
[4] "CO2 promotes total oxidation of methane."
[5] "The dissociation of CO2 seems to be responsible for this promotion."
[6] "The adjustment of the concentration of N2O and CO2 thus clearly appears as a promising tool to improve the selectivity of partial oxidation products and the energetic efficiency in combustion."

The influence of adding 300 ppm of N2O and 3% of CO2 in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation of methane, respectively, was studied using two catalyst systems. In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes. N2O increases the selectivity for propylene, while decreasing the conversion of propane and oxygen, and the yield in CO2. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum. Conversely, CO2 promotes total oxidation of methane, which is attributed to the dissociation of CO2. Adjusting the concentration of N2O and CO2 can improve the selectivity of partial oxidation products and enhance the energetic efficiency in combustion.

在丙烷氧化脱氢和甲烷氧化过程中添加300 ppm的N2O和3%的CO2对活性催化剂的影响进行了研究。在两种情况下，选择性位点均受到气体助剂的影响。N2O增加了丙烯的选择性，同时减少了丙烷和氧气的转化率以及二氧化碳的产率。N2O促进了钼的还原。相反，CO2促进了甲烷的完全氧化，这归因于CO2的分解。调整N2O和CO2的浓度可以提高部分氧化产物的选择性和增强燃烧的能量效率。
