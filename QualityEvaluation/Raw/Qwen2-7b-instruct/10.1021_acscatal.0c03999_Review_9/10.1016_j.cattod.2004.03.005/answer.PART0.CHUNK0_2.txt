[1] "In both cases, the selective sites are modified by the presence of the gas dopes. With N2O, the selectivity to propylene increases, while the conversion of both propane and oxygen and the yield in CO2 decreases. N2O promotes the reduction of molybdenum. CO2 promotes total oxidation of methane."
[2] "In the mixture, the selectivity is already largely modulated by -Sb2O4."
[3] "According to the XPS results, there is an enrichment in low BE oxygen species of the ceria-zirconia compound when CO2 is present."
