[1] "The use of N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high selectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1C6 alcohols, at relatively high propane conversion (44%)."
[2] "The highest yields of alcohols and propene found with the steamed highly loaded Fe zeolite, i.e. with the zeolite with the highest concentration of the extra-framework Fe sites,reflected in the ESR signals at g = 5.6 and 6.0, indicates that the Fe species bearing the -sites predominantly control the described reaction."

The synthesis methods that influence the catalytic performance of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites in N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane include steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange. Steam treatment increases the concentration of extra-framework Fe sites, which are crucial for the high selectivity and yield of propene and C1C6 alcohols. Solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange can alter the acidity and basicity of the zeolite, affecting its catalytic activity. Key performance metrics include C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield. High conversion of propane and selectivity to propene indicate effective catalytic performance under different reaction conditions.
