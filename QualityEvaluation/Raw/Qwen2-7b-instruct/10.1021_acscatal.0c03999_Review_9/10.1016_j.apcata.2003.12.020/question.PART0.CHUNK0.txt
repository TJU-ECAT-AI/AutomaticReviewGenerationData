The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5.

1. Introduction
Light alkenes are produced by catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes at high temperatures, but alkane conversion is limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, coke formation and the resulting catalyst deactivation represents additional serious problem. Oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes removes hydrogen from the system, shifting thus equilibrium completely to the oxidized products. But the desired products of selective oxidations, as alkenes, alco- hols, aldehydes and organic acids are more reactive than the respective alkanes. This requires tailoring of highly selec- tive catalysts providing activation of alkanes in the presence of alkenes.
Generally, the selectivity in hydrocarbon oxidation by molecular oxygen is mainly controlled by the state of oxy- gen species formed within the catalyst. With mixed metal oxide systems, like, e.g. FeMoO, BiMoO and VPO,according to Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [1], lattice oxy- gen represents the species responsible for selective oxida- tions. Metal ions exchanged in zeolites, as Co, Fe and Mn ions in ZSM-5 [2] and beta structures [35], have appeared Corresponding author.

Wichterlov a). to be active in ethane and propane oxidation with molec- ular oxygen to corresponding alkenes. However, the activ- ity of both mixed metal oxides and metallo-zeolites is still low for industrial application. Moreover, the function of metal ion site in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over metallo-zeolites is so far not completely understood.
In the last decade, much attention has also been devoted to the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons with nitrous oxide to respective alcohols. Easy decomposition of nitrous oxide leads to formation of atomic oxygen, which is a highly se- lective oxidant providing insertion of an oxygen atom into a hydrocarbon molecule. The most successful catalyst and corresponding process has been developed for benzene hy- droxylation with nitrous oxide to phenol over Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst by Panovs group and scaled up by Monsanto Co.
[6]. Panov et al. [7] have also shown that, e.g. methane can be oxidized with N2O to methanol, but at the temperature needed for desorption of methanol from the catalyst its fur- ther oxidation to carbon oxides occurred.
Although that the hydroxylation activity of H-ZSM-5 (with trace concentrations of iron) and Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts has at first been attributed to the protonic and Al-Lewis sites [812], it has finally been evidenced [7,1315] that the Fe impurities in H-ZSM-5 zeolites play a decisive role in the reaction. Particularly, the Fe ions released from the ze- olite framework into the extra-framework positions at high 0926-860X/$  see front matter  2004 Elsevier B.V.

anek et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 264 (2004) 1322 calcination temperatures or by the zeolite steaming exhibit extremely high activity [16]. Low concentration of iron also prevents formation of bulk iron oxide, which might enhance hydrocarbon total combustion. The concentration of the so-called -oxygen formed by N2O decomposition in the zeolite, correlated well with the concentration of Fe in the zeolite. Mssbauer and EXAFS studies of Fe zeolites revealed presence of the dinuclear Fe complexes bearing bridging oxygen atoms [1720]. However, a straightforward correlation between the concentration of these sites and zeolite hydroxylation activity was not reported so far. Thus,the question if the active site has a dinuclear (FeOFe) or mononuclear (FeO) character is still open.
Recently, the activity of ZSM-5 zeolite with the ex- changed Fe3+, Mn2+ and Co2+ ions in oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane with oxygen and nitrous oxide has been reported [2]. It was found out that with nitrous oxide,in comparison with molecular oxygen, high selectivity to propene was achieved, particularly on samples calcined at relatively high temperature, 900 C. The authors assume that while -oxygen is responsible for the hydroxylation activity, the Ospecies might oxidize alkanes to alkenes.
Very recently, we reported enhancement of propene produc- tion over CoH-BEA zeolite by addition of nitrous oxide to oxygen [21]. It has been found out that nitrous oxide is more selective, but less active compared to molecular oxygen.
Synergy effect of oxygen and nitrous oxide led to three-fold higher yield of propene than that one if oxygen or nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant. There is also reported en- hancement of the non-selective oxidation of ethane to carbon oxides by trace concentration of iron [22], and the activity of Fe-zeolites in the oxidation of ethane with N2O [23], where new Fe species are expected to be formed during the reac- tion. During preparation of this manuscript a paper has ap- peared describing high activity in oxidation of propane with N2O over steamed Fe-MFI zeolites [24]. The authors found among the products mainly propene and propionaldehyde.
In this study, the effect of iron concentration and steaming of FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with low Fe content on their activity in selective oxidation of propane to propene and oxygenates is investigated and compared at conditions when as oxidant is used oxygen or nitrous oxide or their mixture. From the complete product analysis of propane oxidation with differ- ent oxidants, it is speculated on the reaction pathway.

2. Experimental
2.1. Zeolites
H-ZSM-5 zeolites (originally NH4-ZSM-5) with differ- ent iron content and treated at various conditions were used.NH4-MFI (Si/Al = 28) with trace Fe concentration (30 ppm Fe) and NH4-MFI (Si/Al = 28) with 1200 ppm Fe were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis by using of tetraethy- lorthosilicate, Al nitrate and Fe nitrate, as sources of silicon,aluminium and iron. Preparation procedure was described in ref. [15]. The synthesized zeolites were thoroughly washed by distilled water, dried, and calcined in a stream of dry oxygen at 500 C for 6 h to remove the template. The NH4 forms of zeolites were prepared by repeated three times ion exchange of the calcined material with 0.5 M NH4NO3 at 25 C. NH4-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 12.5, 190 ppm Fe) was provided by the Research Institute of Inorganic Chemistry Inc., CZ. A part of the NH4-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 28,1200 ppm Fe) and that of NH4-MFI zeolite (Si/Al = 12.5,190 ppm Fe) was treated in a stream of oxygen containing 30% water vapor at temperature 600 C for 6 h, and in addi- tion a part of the steamed zeolite (Si/Al = 28, 1200 ppm Fe) was transformed into Na form by repeated (three times) ion exchange using 0.1 M NaCl solution at 25 C. The elemental analysis of zeolites was done by X-ray fluorescence spec- troscopy and inductively coupled plasma emission spectrom- etry. The chemical analysis is given in Table 1. The samples are labeled as follows: iron-cocation-zeolite structure-iron concentration in ppm.
2.2. IR spectra of Fe-zeolites
The concentration of Brnsted and Lewis sites in zeolites was determined by quantitative analysis of FTIR spectra of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile according to procedure described elsewhere [25]. Thin transparent self-supporting wafers of zeolites (56 mg/cm2) were calcined at 480 C with fol- lowing evacuation. Adsorption of 1.2 kPa of d3-acetonitrile was carried out at RT followed by evacuation for 20 min at the same temperature. Spectra of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile were recorded at RT with 2 cm1 resolution by collecting of 200 scans. The spectra intensities were normalized on a sample thickness of 5.5 mg/cm2 using the integrated area of

anek et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 264 (2004) 1322 15 the zeolite skeletal bands from 1750 to 2100 cm1. IR bands of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile were deconvoluted into Gaus- sian profiles. A band at 2297 cm1 was ascribed to the in- teraction of Brnsted sites with the CN group of acetonitrile and the bands at 2325 cm1 corresponded to the interac- tion of acetonitrile with Al-Lewis sites. If electron acceptor Fe sites were present then the respective band of adsorbed acetonitrile overlapped the band of adsorbed acetonitrile on Brnsted sites and quantitative analysis of these sites was not possible.
2.3. ESR spectra of Fe ions
ESR spectra of Fe3+ ions were monitored in the X-band region on an ESR spectrometer (ERS-220, Germany). Spec- tra were recorded at RT in the region of 30500 mT. Before the measurements the spectra of the samples were pretreated in a stream of dry oxygen at 480 C for 2 h, cooled to RT,and evacuated for 30 min at 102 Pa. The samples were then transferred under vacuum to a quartz cell and sealed. Mn2+ ions in a solid matrix were used as an internal standard.
2.4. Catalytic tests
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was carried out in a fixed bed through flow microreactor at atmospheric pres- sure. The amount of catalyst used was 0.2 g mixed with
1.5 cm3 of inert silicon carbide. Typically, a total flow rate
was 100 cm3/min and the feed composition was 5 vol.% of propane and 6.5 vol.% of O2 or 10 vol.% of N2O or
6.5 vol.% O2 + 10 vol.% N2O in helium. The catalysts were
pretreated in a flow of oxygen at a temperature of 500 C for 2 h before each reaction run. The reactions were mea- sured at the temperature of 450 C. Analysis of the reaction mixture was performed using on-line connected gas chro- matograph CHROM-5 (CZ) equipped with thermal conduc- tivity and flame ionization detectors. Hydrocarbons, related oxygenates, carbon dioxide and N2O were separated on a packed column Porapak Q. Permanent gases (N2, O2, CO and CH4) were separated on the molecular sieve 5A col- umn. Conversion, selectivity and yield were calculated on the basis of mass balance.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 illustrates IR spectra of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile on FeH-zeolites. The spectra show that the parent zeolites con- tain predominantly Brnsted sites and much lower concen- tration of Lewis sites. The zeolite steaming is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the concentration of Brnsted sites, while that of Lewis sites is only slightly changed (see Table 1). The structural changes occurring under zeolite steaming were also reflected in the changes of the location of Fe ions. Due to low concentration of Fe in zeolites, we 2360 2340 2320 2300 2280 2260 2240 2220 2200

In Fig. 2, there are shown the ESR spectra of zeolites calcined in oxygen as well as steamed ones. It is seen that in calcined zeolites some Fe is in cationic sites, represented by a signal at g = 4.3, reflecting tetrahe- drally coordinated Fe ions. After zeolite steaming the signal at g = 4.3 increased in intensity and the signals at g = 5.6 and 6.0, appeared indicating appearance of Fe in distorted tetrahedral coordination in extra-framework positions. Note that the signal at g = 4.3 might reflects both Fe3+ in the framework and at extra-framework sites (see [15,26,27]).
Catalytic activity of FeH-zeolites expressed in terms of propane conversion, yield of propene and product selectivity with respect to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, is summa- rized in Table 2. The results of propane oxidation in oxy- gen, nitrous oxide and in their mixture over FeH-ZSM-5 with various Fe content, regardless of the state of iron, evi- dence that the active sites are exclusively Fe centers, and that the protonic sites are not responsible for the zeolite redox activity, although they can participate in acid-like transfor- mations within the reactantproduct mixture. These results represent further support for the conclusion that the redox activity of H-zeolites is only apparent, caused in fact by the highly active Fe sites always present in trace concentra- tions in the zeolites, as already reported for the reactions of NONO2 equilibration [28,29], and benzene oxidation with N2O [7,1315]. Hundreds of ppm of Fe are usually present 16

All the investigated zeolites exhibited low activity in the oxidation of propane with oxygen at conditions selected in this study. The activities of catalysts are compared at the re- action time-on-stream (T-O-S) of 400 min. The conversion of propane reached maximally 3.4% for the steamed zeo- lite with maximum iron content. The main products were propene and carbon oxides. Selectivity towards propene reached 44.0%, but the yield was only 1.5%. It means that the iron present in the zeolite do not significantly activate molecular oxygen under the reaction conditions to provide propane oxidation.
Replacement of oxygen in propane oxidation with nitrous oxide led to a dramatic increase in propane conversion over FeH-MFI zeolites, particularly over the zeolites steamed at 600 C (3.4% versus 43.5% for FeH-MFI-1200-HT). An in- crease in the activity was also accompanied by a substan- tial increase in the selectivity to propene (44.0% versus
55.9%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (0%
versus 29.0%); being again the highest with the steamed zeolites. Among the products appeared methanol, ethanol,iso- and n-propanol, phenol and acetone. Also the products of propane cracking, i.e. methane, ethane and ethene ap- peared when N2O was used. On the other hand, an increase in propane conversion over FeH-MFI-190-C calcined in dry oxygen (3.8% versus 1.2%), when N2O instead of oxygen was used, was much lower. It implies that using N2O as oxidant compared to oxygen resulted in the higher propane conversions, higher selectivity to propene and in the appear- ance of alcohols in the products as well as of products of propane cracking and propene dimerization. These enhance- ments were higher with increasing Fe content in the zeolite and with the zeolites steamed at high temperature compared to those calcined in dry oxygen.
These results suggest that nitrous oxide is activated on the extra-framework Fe sites generated from the framework sites by zeolite steaming, but to much less extent by cal- cination of the zeolite in a dry oxygen stream, as follows from the ESR spectra of the Fe ions (see Fig. 2). It has been shown that the iron in the synthetized zeolites is mainly in the framework positions, in addition to Fe in iron oxide-like species. Such framework sites as well as oxide species are not active in N2O decomposition and generation of active oxygen species is connected with the process of leaching of Fe to the cationic sites. Panov and co-workers [7,13,14] and Kubnek et al. [15] reported that calcination of the zeo- lite at 480 C under dry oxygen does not lead to extraction of a substantial amount of iron from the tetrahedral frame- work positions and, therefore, calcined Fe-zeolites did not exhibit substantial catalytic activity. Upon the steaming at 600 C, the tetrahedrally coordinated Fe in the framework is extracted to the cationic positions by hydrolysis of SiOFe bonds [15,16]. This process leads to formation of various iron species, including isolated iron ions and oligonuclear Fe species. Sobolev et al. [30] reported that the iron ions with the so-called -site are not able to activate molecular oxy- gen, but they decompose nitrous oxide to molecular nitrogen and atomic oxygen bound to extra-framework Fe sites. The Fe species reflected in the ESR spectra by the signals at g =5.6 and 6.0 are expected to be the sites active in N2O ox- idations, while the signal at g = 4.3 did not correlate with the zeolite activity in benzene hydroxylation [15].
Oxidation of propane with N2O over the steamed Fe-zeolites led to production of a high amount of propene.
In addition, a considerable amount of other oxygenates (methanol, ethanol, iso-propyl and n-propyl alcohol, phenol and acrolein) and aromatics (benzene and toluene) were formed. Only small amount of propane was lost by its oxi- dation to carbon oxides. However, the catalyst performance depended on the reaction time-on-stream. Fig. 3 shows the dependence of propane conversion, propene yield, and se- lectivity to propene and the sum of oxygenates and higher hydrocarbons on T-O-S over steamed FeH-MFI-1200 cat- alyst. With decreasing propane conversion from 63.0 to
43.5%, the selectivity to propene increased as well as the
yield of propene, which reached ca. 24% within 100 min T-O-S and then remained relatively constant. On the other hand, the selectivity to the sum of known oxygenates re- main nearly constant with T-O-S (it change from 24.6 to
26.4%) as well as the selectivity to the sum of products of
propane cracking (7.1%). The distribution of oxygenates was substantially changed with T-O-S, as given in Table 3.

Aromatics nearly disappeared within the T-O-S experiment, and accordingly decreased the selectivity to phenol. As for iso-propyl alco- hol, its selectivity increased with the reaction time. However,the substantial amount of unknown products formed during the early stage of the reaction, which nearly disappeared within the T-O-S experiment. Some coke was deposited on the catalyst surface during the reaction. We suppose that the deactivation of catalysts is caused by formation of car- bonaceous deposits blocking the active surface. Formation of coke can be mostly connected with the presence of strong acidic protons in the zeolite surface as well as by the pres- ence of Fe and Al electron acceptor sites. Blocking of these acid sites is accompanied by the observed lower selectivity to aromatics and phenol, and thus the higher selectivity to propene and propanols.
Oxidation of propane with N2O over Na form compared to H form of steamed zeolite (FeNa-MFI-1200-HT, contain- ing trace concentration of Brnsted sites) was manifested in a slightly lower propane conversion, lower degree of de- activation with T-O-S, resulting in the higher selectivity to propene and constant yield of propene, as well as in a consid- erably lower selectivity to the sum of hydrocarbons and phe- nol excluding propene and iso-propyl alcohol (see Table 4 and Fig. 4). Stable reaction performance was achieved within 300 min with respect to all products.
From the product analysis and performance of the cata- lysts in T-O-S, it can be speculated that the first step of the propane oxidation with N2O is cracking of propane to lower weight hydrocarbons and propene dimerization to benzene.
Simultaneously, propane and other hydrocarbons are oxi- dized to alcohols and phenol. However, the product compo- sitions at different zeolites do not allow us to speculate how propene is formed either by simple oxidative dehydrogena- tion or via alcohols dehydration. Further studies are needed to the reaction pathway.
Using a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide as oxidants resulted with all the catalysts in an increase in propane nconversion accompanied by a substantial increase in the selectivity to carbon oxides and a decrease in the propene selectivity, but not in substantial changes in the propene yields. The selectivity to and production of oxygenates and aromatics decreased dramatically, and C1C3 alcohols were the most populated products among oxygenates.
Different T-O-S behavior of propane conversion was ob- served depending on the oxidation agents used (see Fig. 5).
With molecular oxygen no deactivation occurred, while with N2O a substantial deactivation was found, being slightly slower with the Na-form compared to H-form of the Fe zeolite. This finding corresponds to the presence of acidic protonic sites, which catalyze oligomerization and aroma- tization and hydrogen transfer reactions (as seen from the product composition) leading to formation of coke precur- sors. Moreover, the N2O presence can initiate radical reac- tions. Participation of radicals in the oxidation process also supports formation of coke precursors. If, on the other hand,a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide was employed a lower deactivation in T-O-S was observed compared to the oxida- tion only with nitrous oxide. A lower deactivation during the oxidation reaction with a mixture of N2O and oxygen can be attributed to the oxidation of the reaction intermediates to carbon oxides by molecular oxygen.

The obtained data cannot provide clear conclusion on the mechanism of propene formation. Aika and Lunsford [31,32] investigated dehydrogenation of light alkanes (mainly ethane) to alkenes by Ostabilized at the surface of MgO after the reaction of N2O with electrons trapped on the surface. They suggested that the net reaction involves hydrogen abstraction from alkane with formation of surface OHgroup and alkyl radical (like for gas phase reactions),which is transformed to alkoxides via reaction with O2.

However, the suggestion on the formation of propene with participation of Ospecies [2] and of alcohols through the -oxygen does not seem to be likely mechanism. The product composition indicates that under propane oxidation with nitrous oxide, a spectrum of C1C6 alcohols is readily formed (sum of their selectivity is 1525%, with the highest selectivity to propyl alcohols). Their formation is a result of 22
R. Bul
anek et al. / Applied Catalysis A: General 264 (2004) 1322 propane cracking and oligomerization to C1C6 hydrocar- bons. While alcohols formation can be expected to proceeds via -oxygen, mechanism of formation of propene is not clear. Either reaction pathway through alcohol dehydration or direct propane oxidative dehydrogenation can be expected to occur.
The highest yields of alcohols and propene found with the steamed highly loaded Fe zeolite, i.e. with the zeolite with the highest concentration of the extra-framework Fe sites,reflected in the ESR signals at g = 5.6 and 6.0, indicates that the Fe species bearing the -sites predominantly control the described reaction.
4. Conclusions
Oxidation of propane with oxygen, nitrous oxide or with a mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide over calcined and steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites with various Fe contents (301200 ppm) demonstrated high catalytic activity of the steamed zeolites in the propane oxidation by N2O and low activity if only oxygen was employed. The use of N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high se- lectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1C6 alcohols, at relatively high propane conversion (44%). Yield of propene is comparable to that one achieved with most active mixed metal oxides for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. An advantage of this catalytic system is a substantially lower reaction temperature (450 C) in comparison with the mixed metal oxide catalysts operating in the temperature range 550650 C. In addition to propene, other valuable products as ethene, methanol, ethanol and acetone are formed.
The activity of Fe-zeolites depends on the Fe content and conditions of zeolite pre-treatments. The highest cat- alytic activity exhibit Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe con- tent steamed in the flow of water vapor at 600 C. The level of deactivation of the FeH-ZSM-5 catalyst might be de- creased by using of a suitable ratio of N2O/O2 and by elim- ination of protonic sites. In agreement with the conclusions of Panovs group on hydroxylation of benzene with nitrous oxide, the catalytic activity in propane oxidation by N2O was ascribed to the presence extra-framework Fe species in ZSM-5. Propane oxidation to propene by nitrous oxide and/or by its mixture with oxygen might be advantageously applied using tail gases from adipic acid, as suggested for benzene oxidation with N2O to phenol [33], or those from the other technology units producing nitrous oxide.
