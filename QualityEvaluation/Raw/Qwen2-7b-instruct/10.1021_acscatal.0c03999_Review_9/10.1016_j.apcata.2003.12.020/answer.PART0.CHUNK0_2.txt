[1] "The highest conversion of propane (51.7%) and selectivity to propene (39.7%) and to the sum of aromatics and oxygenates (11.5%, mainly C1C3 alcohols) was achieved if a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5."
[2] "The use of N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high selectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1C6 alcohols, at relatively high propane conversion (44%)."
[3] "The level of deactivation of the FeH-ZSM-5 catalyst might be decreased by using of a suitable ratio of N2O/O2 and by elimination of protonic sites."
[4] "Propane oxidation to propene by nitrous oxide and/or by its mixture with oxygen might be advantageously applied using tail gases from adipic acid."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The highest conversion of propane and selectivity to propene and oxygenates was achieved when a mixture of oxygen with nitrous oxide was used as an oxidant over steamed FeH-ZSM-5. 
2. Using nitrous oxide as an oxidant led to high selectivity to propene and the formation of C1C6 alcohols, with high propane conversion. 
3. The deactivation of FeH-ZSM-5 catalyst can be reduced by employing an appropriate ratio of N2O/O2 and removing protonic sites.  
4. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene using nitrous oxide or its mixture with oxygen could be beneficially applied using the off-gases from adipic acid production.

1. 使用氧气与一氧化二氮混合物作为氧化剂，在蒸煮过的FeH-ZSM-5上实现了丙烷最高转化率和丙烯以及氧代化合物的高选择性。
2. 使用一氧化二氮作为氧化剂，可获得高丙烯选择性和形成C1C6醇类，同时具有较高的丙烷转化率。 
3. 可以通过调整N2O/O2的比例并消除质子位点来降低FeH-ZSM-5催化剂的失活程度。  
4. 利用脂肪酸生产过程中的尾气，可以有效地应用一氧化二氮或其与氧气混合进行丙烷氧化脱氢制取丙烯。
