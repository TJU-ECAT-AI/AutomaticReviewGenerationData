[1] "All the investigated zeolites exhibited low activity in the oxidation of propane with oxygen at conditions selected in this study. The activities of catalysts are compared at the re- action time-on-stream (T-O-S) of 400 min."
[2] "An increase in propane conversion over FeH-MFI-190-C calcined in dry oxygen (3.8% versus 1.2%), when N2O instead of oxygen was used, was much lower. It implies that using N2O as oxidant compared to oxygen resulted in the higher propane conversions, higher selectivity to propene and in the appear- ance of alcohols in the products as well as of products of propane cracking and propene dimerization."
[3] "The highest yields of alcohols and propene found with the steamed highly loaded Fe zeolite, i.e. with the zeolite with the highest concentration of the extra-framework Fe sites,reflected in the ESR signals at g = 5.6 and 6.0, indicates that the Fe species bearing the -sites predominantly control the described reaction."
[4] "The use of N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 leads to very high se- lectivity to propene (56%), in addition to C1C6 alcohols, at relatively high propane conversion (44%)."
[5] "The level of deactivation of the FeH-ZSM-5 catalyst might be decreased by using of a suitable ratio of N2O/O2 and by elim- ination of protonic sites."
[6] "In agreement with the conclusions of Panovs group on hydroxylation of benzene with nitrous oxide, the catalytic activity in propane oxidation by N2O was ascribed to the presence extra-framework Fe species in ZSM-5."

1. The various synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites, such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange, affect their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction. The steam treatment leads to the highest level of deactivation of the FeH-ZSM-5 catalyst, whereas the solid-state ion exchange and liquid exchange methods can potentially reduce deactivation by using a suitable ratio of N2O/O2 and eliminating protonic sites.

2. The steamed Fe-zeolites demonstrate high catalytic activity in the propane oxidation by N2O, achieving a high selectivity to propene (56%) along with the formation of C1C6 alcohols at a relatively high propane conversion (44%).

3. The catalytic activity of Fe-zeolites depends on factors such as the Fe content and the conditions of the zeolite pre-treatments. The steamed Fe-zeolites with the highest Fe content and steamed at high temperatures exhibit the highest catalytic activity in the ODHP reaction.

4. Using N2O as an oxidant over the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites leads to a very high selectivity to propene (56%), along with the formation of C1C6 alcohols, at a relatively high propane conversion (44%).

5. The presence of extra-framework Fe species in ZSM-5 zeolites, as identified by the ESR signals at g = 5.6 and 6.0, is attributed to the high catalytic activity in propane oxidation by N2O.

6. The catalytic activity in propane oxidation by N2O was attributed to the presence of extra-framework Fe species in ZSM-5 zeolites, in agreement with the findings of Panov's group on the hydroxylation of benzene with nitrous oxide.

1. 不同的合成方法，如蒸汽处理、固态离子交换和液体交换，会影响铁含量的ZSM-5沸石在N2O辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的催化性能。蒸汽处理会导致FeH-ZSM-5催化剂的最高失活水平，而固态离子交换和液体交换方法可以通过使用N2O/O2的适当比例和消除质子性位点来降低失活。

2. 蒸汽处理的Fe-沸石在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化表现出很高的催化活性，丙烯选择性达到56%，同时形成C1C6醇，丙烷转化率达到44%左右。

3. Fe-沸石的催化活性取决于Fe含量和预处理条件。具有最高Fe含量和在高温下蒸汽处理的Fe-沸石在ODHP反应中显示出最高的催化活性。

4. 使用N2O作为氧化剂的蒸煮FeH-ZSM-5沸石导致丙烯选择性极高（56%），同时形成C1C6醇，丙烷转化率达到44%左右。

5. ZSM-5沸石中额外框架Fe物种的存在，通过ESR信号g=5.6和6.0的识别，被归因于N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化的高催化活性。

6. 在N2O辅助下的丙烷氧化的催化活性被归因于ZSM-5沸石中额外框架Fe物种的存在，与Panov团队关于苯的硝酸盐氧化的研究结果一致。
