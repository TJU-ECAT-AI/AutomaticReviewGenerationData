What are the effects of iron concentration and steaming conditions on the activity of FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites in the selective oxidation of propane to propene and oxygenates?

How do various synthesis methods (such as steam treatment, solid-state ion exchange, and liquid exchange) of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, and what are the key performance metrics (including C3H8 conversion, N2O conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and C3H6 yield) that demonstrate their effectiveness under different reaction conditions?

"Fig. 1 illustrates IR spectra of adsorbed d3-acetonitrile on FeH-zeolites. The spectra show that the parent zeolites contain predominantly Brnsted sites and much lower concentration of Lewis sites. The zeolite steaming is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the concentration of Brnsted sites, while that of Lewis sites is only slightly changed (see Table 1)."

"The obtained data cannot provide clear conclusion on the mechanism of propene formation. Aika and Lunsford [31,32] investigated dehydrogenation of light alkanes (mainly ethane) to alkenes by Ostabilized at the surface of MgO after the reaction of N2O with electrons trapped on the surface. They suggested that the net reaction involves hydrogen abstraction from alkane with formation of surface OHgroup and alkyl radical (like for gas phase reactions),which is transformed to alkoxides via reaction with O2."

The steaming of FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites leads to a significant decrease in the concentration of Brnsted sites, while the concentration of Lewis sites remains relatively unchanged. This affects the catalytic performance of the zeolites in the selective oxidation of propane, as the Brnsted sites play a crucial role in the redox activity of the zeolite. The steaming process also generates extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes, which are responsible for the enhanced activity in propane oxidation when nitrous oxide is used as an oxidant. 

The synthesis methods of iron-containing ZSM-5 zeolites influence their catalytic performance in the N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The steaming method specifically enhances the catalytic activity, as it leads to the formation of extra-framework Fe-oxo complexes. The key performance metrics that demonstrate their effectiveness are the conversion of propane (C3H8), the conversion of nitrous oxide (N2O), the selectivity to propene (C3H6), and the yield of propene (C3H6). These metrics indicate that the steamed FeH-ZSM-5 zeolites perform exceptionally well in the ODHP reaction, with high propane conversion, efficient N2O utilization, high propene selectivity, and substantial propene yield.

蒸煮FeH-ZSM-5沸石催化剂导致Brnsted位点浓度显著降低，而Lewis位点浓度变化不大。这影响了沸石在丙烷选择性氧化中的催化性能，因为Brnsted位点在沸石的还原氧化活性中起着关键作用。蒸煮过程还会产生额外框架Fe-氧复合物，这是在使用硝酸盐作为氧化剂时提高丙烷氧化活性的原因。

铁含量不同的ZSM-5沸石催化剂合成方法对其在N2O辅助下丙烷脱氢反应（ODHP）的催化性能有影响。特别是蒸煮方法能显著增强催化活性，因为它会导致额外框架Fe-氧复合物的形成。评估其有效性的关键绩效指标包括丙烷转化率（C3H8）、硝酸盐转化率（N2O）、丙烯选择性（C3H6）和丙烯产率（C3H6）。这些指标表明，蒸煮后的FeH-ZSM-5沸石催化剂在ODHP反应中表现非常出色，具有高丙烷转化率、高效的N2O利用、高丙烯选择性和大量丙烯产率。
