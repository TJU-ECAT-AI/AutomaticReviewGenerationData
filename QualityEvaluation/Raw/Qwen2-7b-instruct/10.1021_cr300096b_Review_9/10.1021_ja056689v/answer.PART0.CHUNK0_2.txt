1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial applications such as the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. These processes are crucial for producing perfumes, flavors, and other valuable compounds. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process span both theoretical and experimental domains. Theoretical approaches, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, help understand the mechanisms involved, while experimental techniques allow for the validation of theoretical predictions and the optimization of reaction conditions.

2. The study reveals that the hydrogenation of C═O bonds on a platinum catalyst surface is more favorable than the hydrogenation of C-C bonds. This finding contradicts the common empirical rule suggesting that C-C bonds are more reactive. Instead, the hydrogenation at the C═O bond follows a unique mechanism that bridges the gap between the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) and Rideal-Eley classical schemes. This mechanism involves the existence of precursor states where hydrogen can coadsorb closer to a partially decoordinated molecule, leading to an early transition state on the potential energy surface.

3. The study emphasizes the importance of considering all the new competitive routes presented for a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogenation process. By examining these routes, researchers can refine their models to predict the selectivity and optimize the process parameters for enhanced efficiency and product purity.

4. The hydrogenation of C═O bonds is characterized by lower activation barriers compared to the C-C bonds, which follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This difference in activation barriers is attributed to the existence of precursor states where hydrogen can coadsorb closer to a partially decoordinated molecule. The proximity of both reactants in these precursor states facilitates the formation of early transition states on the potential energy surface, providing insight into the mechanism behind the preferential hydrogenation of C═O bonds.

1. 包括铂-镍双金属催化剂在内的催化氢化有机分子在金属表面的应用，对精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化具有重要意义。这些过程对于生产香精、调味料和其他有价值化合物至关重要。用于研究、优化和提高选择性和效率的方法覆盖了理论和实验领域。理论方法，如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，有助于理解涉及的机制，而实验技术则允许验证理论预测并优化反应条件。

2. 研究表明，铂催化剂表面的C═O键氢化比C-C键氢化更为有利。这一发现与常见的经验规则相矛盾，该规则认为C-C键活性更高。相反，C═O键的氢化遵循一种独特的机制，介于兰穆尔-亨希尔伍德（LH）和里德尔-埃利经典方案之间。这种机制涉及到氢可以在部分脱协调分子附近更靠近吸附的状态下共吸附，导致潜在能量表面上的早期过渡状态。

3. 研究强调考虑所有新提出的竞争路线对于全面理解氢化过程的重要性。通过检查这些路径，研究人员可以完善其模型，以预测选择性并优化过程参数，从而提高效率和产品纯度。

4. C═O键的氢化特征是激活势垒较低，而C-C键则遵循兰穆尔-亨希尔伍德机制。这种差异归因于存在氢可以在部分脱协调分子附近更靠近共吸附的状态，形成早期过渡状态在潜在能量表面上的机制。这两种反应物在这些预过渡状态的邻近提供了有关为什么优先氢化C═O键的见解。
