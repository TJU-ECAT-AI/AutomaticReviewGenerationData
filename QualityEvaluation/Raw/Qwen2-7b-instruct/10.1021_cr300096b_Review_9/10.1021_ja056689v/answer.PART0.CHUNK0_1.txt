[1] "In the recent years, model approaches of hydrogenation of organic molecules on metal surfaces have commonly retained the LangmuirHinshelwood (LH) mechanism as the most probable one."
[2] "However, several questions remain open for the selective hydrogenation of multifunctional molecules having conjugated CC and CO double bonds, in terms of general mechanism, interdependence of the double bonds, and origin of the observed selectivity."
[3] "In fact, previous density functional theory (DFT) studies devoted to the hydrogenations of alkenes and ketones on Pt(111) have demonstrated that both reactants (hydrogen and organic molecule) are intrinsically bonded to the surface all along the reaction pathway."
[4] "The usual empirical rule stating that the CC bond is more reactive than the CO group for catalytic hydrogenations of unsaturated aldehydes is invalidated from the present study."
[5] "The explanation of such catalytic behavior is the existence of metastable precursor states for the OH bond formation showing that the attack at the oxygen atom follows a new preferential mechanism where the CO moiety is not directly bonded with the Pt surface atoms."
[6] "When the whole catalytic cycle is considered, our results reconcile with experimental studies devoted to hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt, since the desorption step of the partially hydrogenated product (unsaturated alcohol versus saturated aldehyde) plays a key role for the selectivity."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes enable the efficient production of various chemical intermediates, which are essential components in the manufacturing of fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Additionally, the conversion of cellulosic biomass into valuable chemical feedstocks represents a sustainable approach to chemical production.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies. On the theoretical front, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to understand the underlying mechanisms and energetics of the hydrogenation reactions. These calculations help predict the most likely pathways for the reaction, the stability of intermediates, and the activation barriers involved in the transformation of reactants into products. By identifying the key steps and parameters that influence the reaction outcomes, scientists can design catalysts with enhanced performance tailored to specific applications.

Experimentally, researchers perform hydrogenation reactions using model substrates and catalysts under controlled conditions. They analyze the products' composition, purity, and yield to assess the reaction's selectivity and efficiency. Techniques such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectroscopic methods are used to characterize the reactants, intermediates, and products. Furthermore, kinetic studies are conducted to understand the rates of individual reaction steps, which is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst design.

By integrating these theoretical and experimental approaches, scientists can gain comprehensive insights into the hydrogenation processes, enabling the development of more efficient catalysts, improved reaction conditions, and novel synthetic routes for the production of fine chemicals and bio-derived materials. This interdisciplinary work not only advances fundamental knowledge in catalysis and chemical engineering but also drives innovation in sustainable chemical manufacturing practices.
