[1] "In the recent years, model approaches of hydrogenation of organic molecules on metal surfaces have commonly retained the LangmuirHinshelwood (LH) mechanism as the most probable one."
[2] "However, several questions remain open for the selective hydrogenation of multifunctional molecules having conjugated CC and CO double bonds, in terms of general mechanism, interdependence of the double bonds, and origin of the observed selectivity."
[3] "Here the DFT approach is generalized to all the competitive first and second hydrogenation routes (see Figure 1)."
[4] "From a thorough first-principles analysis of the complete catalytic scheme, we aim at determining whether the attack at the CO bond is always favored and whether the LH mechanism still holds for the hydrogenation of conjugated molecules."
[5] "The usual empirical rule stating that the CC bond is more reactive than the CO group for catalytic hydrogenations of unsaturated aldehydes is invalidated from the present study."
[6] "When the whole catalytic cycle is considered, our results reconcile with experimental studies devoted to hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt, since the desorption step of the partially hydrogenated product (unsaturated alcohol versus saturated aldehyde) plays a key role for the selectivity."
[7] "Indeed, unsaturated alcohols yielded by a preferential hydrogenation of the CO group are valuable intermediates for the production of perfumes and flavors."
[8] "On the contrary, the attack at the CC group systematically follows a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism, and the activation barrier is high (0.820.85 eV)."
[9] "The existence of a precursor state where hydrogen can coadsorb closer to a partially decoordinated molecule is responsible for the preferential activity at the CO bond."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial and research applications such as the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. The process is studied and optimized through both theoretical and experimental methodologies to enhance selectivity and efficiency. The LangmuirHinshelwood (LH) mechanism is commonly employed for hydrogenation reactions on metal surfaces. However, for multifunctional molecules containing conjugated CC and CO double bonds, the general mechanism, interdependence of the double bonds, and the origin of selectivity remain open questions. The DFT approach is utilized to analyze all competitive hydrogenation routes, revealing that the attack at the C═O bond is always favored and that the LH mechanism still holds for the hydrogenation of conjugated molecules. Contrary to the common empirical rule, the catalytic hydrogenation of the CC bond is less reactive than that of the C═O group, invalidating the notion that the CC bond is inherently more reactive. The desorption step of partially hydrogenated products plays a crucial role in determining selectivity, as unsaturated alcohols yield valuable intermediates in perfume and flavor production. The attack at the CC bond follows a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism with a high activation barrier, while the C═O bond attack is facilitated by a precursor state where hydrogen can coadsorb closer to a partially decoordinated molecule, thus enhancing the preferential activity at the C═O bond.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化有重大贡献。该过程通过理论和实验方法研究和优化，以提高选择性和效率。Langmuir-Hinshelwood（LH）机制通常用于金属表面的氢化反应。然而，对于包含共轭CC和C═O双键的多功能分子，一般机制、双键之间的相互依赖性以及观察到的选择性的起源仍然是未解之谜。利用第一原理分析全面催化方案的方法揭示了C═O键总是优先攻击，并且LH机制仍然适用于共轭分子的氢化。与常见的经验规则相反，CC键的催化氢化活性低于C═O键，从而推翻了CC键固有更活跃的假设。部分氢化产物的脱附步骤在确定选择性方面起着关键作用，因为由优先氢化的C═O组提供有价值的中间体，这些中间体用于香水和调味品生产。CC键遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制，具有较高的活化能垒，而C═O键攻击则通过氢可以更靠近部分脱附分子吸附的预存状态得到增强，从而增强了C═O键的活性。
