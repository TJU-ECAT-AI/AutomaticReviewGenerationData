The catalytic hydrogenation of multifunctional molecules with conjugated C-C and C-O double bonds, particularly acrolein on Pt(111), shows that the C-O bond is more reactive than the C-C bond, invalidating the usual empirical rule. The reason for this preference lies in the existence of metastable precursor states for OH bond formation, leading to an intermediate pathway between Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Rideal-Eley mechanisms. This pathway involves the C-O moiety not being directly bonded with the Pt surface atoms, resulting in a new mechanism for the hydrogenation of C-O bonds. The selectivity is influenced by the desorption step of the partially hydrogenated product, with unsaturated alcohols being more stable than saturated aldehydes on the Pt surface.

对于具有共轭C-C和C-O双键的多功能分子，尤其是丙烯醛在Pt(111)上的催化氢化，显示C-O键比C-C键更活泼，这与通常的经验规则相悖。这种选择性的原因在于OH键形成存在的过渡态状态，导致介于Langmuir-Hinshelwood和Rideal-Eley机制之间的新路径。这一路径涉及C-O基团未直接与Pt表面原子相连，从而形成一种新的C-O键氢化机制。选择性受部分氢化产物脱附步骤的影响，不饱和醇比饱和醛在Pt表面上更稳定。
