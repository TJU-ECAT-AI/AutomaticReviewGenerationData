<p>However, several questions remain open for the selective hydrogenation of multifunctional molecules having conjugated CC and CO double bonds, in terms of general mechanism, interdependence of the double bonds, and origin of the observed selectivity.</p>
<p>The usual empirical rule stating that the CC bond is more reactive than the CO group for catalytic hydrogenations of unsaturated aldehydes is invalidated from the present study.</p>
<p>The explanation of such catalytic behavior is the existence of metastable precursor states for the OH bond formation showing that the attack at the oxygen atom follows a new preferential mechanism where the CO moiety is not directly bonded with the Pt surface atoms, hence yielding an intermediate pathway between Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Rideal-Eley general types of mechanisms.</p>

The catalytic hydrogenation of multifunctional molecules with conjugated C-C and C-O double bonds, particularly acrolein on Pt(111), shows that the C-O bond is more reactive than the C-C bond, invalidating the usual empirical rule. The reason for this preference lies in the existence of metastable precursor states for OH bond formation, leading to an intermediate pathway between Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Rideal-Eley mechanisms. This pathway involves the C-O moiety not being directly bonded with the Pt surface atoms, resulting in a new mechanism for the hydrogenation of C-O bonds. The selectivity is influenced by the desorption step of the partially hydrogenated product, with unsaturated alcohols being more stable than saturated aldehydes on the Pt surface.

对于具有共轭C-C和C-O双键的多功能分子，尤其是丙烯醛在Pt(111)上的催化氢化，显示C-O键比C-C键更活泼，这与通常的经验规则相悖。这种选择性的原因在于OH键形成存在的过渡态状态，导致介于Langmuir-Hinshelwood和Rideal-Eley机制之间的新路径。这一路径涉及C-O基团未直接与Pt表面原子相连，从而形成一种新的C-O键氢化机制。选择性受部分氢化产物脱附步骤的影响，不饱和醇比饱和醛在Pt表面上更稳定。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes enable the efficient production of various chemical intermediates, which are essential components in the manufacturing of fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and materials. Additionally, the conversion of cellulosic biomass into valuable chemical feedstocks represents a sustainable approach to chemical production.

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies. On the theoretical front, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to understand the underlying mechanisms and energetics of the hydrogenation reactions. These calculations help predict the most likely pathways for the reaction, the stability of intermediates, and the activation barriers involved in the transformation of reactants into products. By identifying the key steps and parameters that influence the reaction outcomes, scientists can design catalysts with enhanced performance tailored to specific applications.

Experimentally, researchers perform hydrogenation reactions using model substrates and catalysts under controlled conditions. They analyze the products' composition, purity, and yield to assess the reaction's selectivity and efficiency. Techniques such as gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectroscopic methods are used to characterize the reactants, intermediates, and products. Furthermore, kinetic studies are conducted to understand the rates of individual reaction steps, which is crucial for optimizing reaction conditions and catalyst design.

By integrating these theoretical and experimental approaches, scientists can gain comprehensive insights into the hydrogenation processes, enabling the development of more efficient catalysts, improved reaction conditions, and novel synthetic routes for the production of fine chemicals and bio-derived materials. This interdisciplinary work not only advances fundamental knowledge in catalysis and chemical engineering but also drives innovation in sustainable chemical manufacturing practices.

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial applications such as the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. These processes are crucial for producing perfumes, flavors, and other valuable compounds. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process span both theoretical and experimental domains. Theoretical approaches, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, help understand the mechanisms involved, while experimental techniques allow for the validation of theoretical predictions and the optimization of reaction conditions.

2. The study reveals that the hydrogenation of C═O bonds on a platinum catalyst surface is more favorable than the hydrogenation of C-C bonds. This finding contradicts the common empirical rule suggesting that C-C bonds are more reactive. Instead, the hydrogenation at the C═O bond follows a unique mechanism that bridges the gap between the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH) and Rideal-Eley classical schemes. This mechanism involves the existence of precursor states where hydrogen can coadsorb closer to a partially decoordinated molecule, leading to an early transition state on the potential energy surface.

3. The study emphasizes the importance of considering all the new competitive routes presented for a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogenation process. By examining these routes, researchers can refine their models to predict the selectivity and optimize the process parameters for enhanced efficiency and product purity.

4. The hydrogenation of C═O bonds is characterized by lower activation barriers compared to the C-C bonds, which follows a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. This difference in activation barriers is attributed to the existence of precursor states where hydrogen can coadsorb closer to a partially decoordinated molecule. The proximity of both reactants in these precursor states facilitates the formation of early transition states on the potential energy surface, providing insight into the mechanism behind the preferential hydrogenation of C═O bonds.

1. 包括铂-镍双金属催化剂在内的催化氢化有机分子在金属表面的应用，对精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化具有重要意义。这些过程对于生产香精、调味料和其他有价值化合物至关重要。用于研究、优化和提高选择性和效率的方法覆盖了理论和实验领域。理论方法，如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，有助于理解涉及的机制，而实验技术则允许验证理论预测并优化反应条件。

2. 研究表明，铂催化剂表面的C═O键氢化比C-C键氢化更为有利。这一发现与常见的经验规则相矛盾，该规则认为C-C键活性更高。相反，C═O键的氢化遵循一种独特的机制，介于兰穆尔-亨希尔伍德（LH）和里德尔-埃利经典方案之间。这种机制涉及到氢可以在部分脱协调分子附近更靠近吸附的状态下共吸附，导致潜在能量表面上的早期过渡状态。

3. 研究强调考虑所有新提出的竞争路线对于全面理解氢化过程的重要性。通过检查这些路径，研究人员可以完善其模型，以预测选择性并优化过程参数，从而提高效率和产品纯度。

4. C═O键的氢化特征是激活势垒较低，而C-C键则遵循兰穆尔-亨希尔伍德机制。这种差异归因于存在氢可以在部分脱协调分子附近更靠近共吸附的状态，形成早期过渡状态在潜在能量表面上的机制。这两种反应物在这些预过渡状态的邻近提供了有关为什么优先氢化C═O键的见解。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial and research applications such as the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. The process is studied and optimized through both theoretical and experimental methodologies to enhance selectivity and efficiency. The LangmuirHinshelwood (LH) mechanism is commonly employed for hydrogenation reactions on metal surfaces. However, for multifunctional molecules containing conjugated CC and CO double bonds, the general mechanism, interdependence of the double bonds, and the origin of selectivity remain open questions. The DFT approach is utilized to analyze all competitive hydrogenation routes, revealing that the attack at the C═O bond is always favored and that the LH mechanism still holds for the hydrogenation of conjugated molecules. Contrary to the common empirical rule, the catalytic hydrogenation of the CC bond is less reactive than that of the C═O group, invalidating the notion that the CC bond is inherently more reactive. The desorption step of partially hydrogenated products plays a crucial role in determining selectivity, as unsaturated alcohols yield valuable intermediates in perfume and flavor production. The attack at the CC bond follows a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism with a high activation barrier, while the C═O bond attack is facilitated by a precursor state where hydrogen can coadsorb closer to a partially decoordinated molecule, thus enhancing the preferential activity at the C═O bond.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化有重大贡献。该过程通过理论和实验方法研究和优化，以提高选择性和效率。Langmuir-Hinshelwood（LH）机制通常用于金属表面的氢化反应。然而，对于包含共轭CC和C═O双键的多功能分子，一般机制、双键之间的相互依赖性以及观察到的选择性的起源仍然是未解之谜。利用第一原理分析全面催化方案的方法揭示了C═O键总是优先攻击，并且LH机制仍然适用于共轭分子的氢化。与常见的经验规则相反，CC键的催化氢化活性低于C═O键，从而推翻了CC键固有更活跃的假设。部分氢化产物的脱附步骤在确定选择性方面起着关键作用，因为由优先氢化的C═O组提供有价值的中间体，这些中间体用于香水和调味品生产。CC键遵循Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制，具有较高的活化能垒，而C═O键攻击则通过氢可以更靠近部分脱附分子吸附的预存状态得到增强，从而增强了C═O键的活性。
