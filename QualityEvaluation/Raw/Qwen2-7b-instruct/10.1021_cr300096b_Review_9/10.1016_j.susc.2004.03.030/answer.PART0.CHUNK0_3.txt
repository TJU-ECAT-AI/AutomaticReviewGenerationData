The study focused on investigating the adsorption of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy using techniques like TPD, AES, HREELS, and LEED. NO2 is adsorbed as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, at 120 K. This dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. It does not desorb molecularly from the chemisorbed monolayer. Instead, it dissociates completely at 300 K, leaving NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to NO and O at temperatures between 300 and 400 K. The maximum oxygen coverage reached by heating the N2O4 monolayer was approximately 0.4 ML. Increasing the NO2 dosage at 600 K allows the oxygen coverage to increase to 1.1 ML. Oxygen desorbs in three clear states from the surface, primarily associated with Pt sites and the decomposition of reduced tin oxide phases, SnOx.

研究集中在使用TPD、AES、HREELS和LEED等技术来探究NO2在(3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1)表面合金上的吸附。在120 K时，NO2以N,N共价键二聚体N2O4的形式吸附，并通过表面单个氧原子以直立但倾斜的几何形状与表面相互作用。该二聚体不会从化学吸附的单层中分子地脱附。相反，在300 K时完全分解，留下NO2、NO和O在表面上。吸附的NO2进一步在300至400 K之间分解为NO和O。加热N2O4单层到的最高氧气覆盖率约为0.4 ML。通过在600 K时增加NO2剂量，氧气覆盖率可以增加到1.1 ML。氧气以三个清晰的状态从表面脱附，主要与Pt位点相关联，以及还原的锡氧化物相的分解。
