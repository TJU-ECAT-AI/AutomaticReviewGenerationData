The study focused on investigating the adsorption of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy using techniques like TPD, AES, HREELS, and LEED. NO2 is adsorbed as the N,N-bonded dimer, N2O4, at 120 K. This dimer interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. It does not desorb molecularly from the chemisorbed monolayer. Instead, it dissociates completely at 300 K, leaving NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Adsorbed NO2 further dissociates to NO and O at temperatures between 300 and 400 K. The maximum oxygen coverage reached by heating the N2O4 monolayer was approximately 0.4 ML. Increasing the NO2 dosage at 600 K allows the oxygen coverage to increase to 1.1 ML. Oxygen desorbs in three clear states from the surface, primarily associated with Pt sites and the decomposition of reduced tin oxide phases, SnOx.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by providing highly selective and efficient means of converting these substrates. These catalysts enable the selective hydrogenation of ketones, esters, and other carbonyl compounds into their corresponding alcohols or hydrocarbons, which are valuable intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and other specialty chemicals. In the context of cellulosic biomass conversion, bimetallic catalysts can facilitate the hydrolysis and hydrogenation steps, leading to the production of biofuels and platform chemicals.

Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains include computational modeling, kinetic studies, and advanced characterization techniques. Computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are used to predict the reaction pathways, stability of intermediates, and the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces. Kinetic studies involve monitoring the reaction rates under varying conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and concentration, to understand the rate-determining steps and to optimize the process parameters. Advanced characterization techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), provide insights into the structure and reactivity of the catalyst surfaces and the nature of the catalytic sites.
