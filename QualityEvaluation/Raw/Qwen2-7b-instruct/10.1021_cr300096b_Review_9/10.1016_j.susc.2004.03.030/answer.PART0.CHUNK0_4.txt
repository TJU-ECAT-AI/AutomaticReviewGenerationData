The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by providing highly selective and efficient means of converting these substrates. These catalysts enable the selective hydrogenation of ketones, esters, and other carbonyl compounds into their corresponding alcohols or hydrocarbons, which are valuable intermediates in the production of pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and other specialty chemicals. In the context of cellulosic biomass conversion, bimetallic catalysts can facilitate the hydrolysis and hydrogenation steps, leading to the production of biofuels and platform chemicals.

Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains include computational modeling, kinetic studies, and advanced characterization techniques. Computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are used to predict the reaction pathways, stability of intermediates, and the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces. Kinetic studies involve monitoring the reaction rates under varying conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and concentration, to understand the rate-determining steps and to optimize the process parameters. Advanced characterization techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), provide insights into the structure and reactivity of the catalyst surfaces and the nature of the catalytic sites.
