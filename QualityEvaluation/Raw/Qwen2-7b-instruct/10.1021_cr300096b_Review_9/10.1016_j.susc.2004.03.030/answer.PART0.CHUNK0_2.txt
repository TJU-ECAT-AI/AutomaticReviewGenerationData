1. The adsorption of NO2 on a (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) surface alloy is studied using various techniques including TPD, AES, HREELS, and LEED. At 120 K, NO2 is adsorbed as a molecular dimer, N2O4, which interacts with the surface through a single oxygen atom in an upright but tilted geometry. This dimer does not desorb molecularly from the monolayer state. Upon heating to 300 K, the dimer dissociates, leaving NO2, NO, and O on the surface. Further dissociation of adsorbed NO2 to NO and O occurs at 300-400 K. Heating the N2O4 monolayer can increase the oxygen atom coverage to 1.1 ML by removing inhibition from coadsorbed NO at 600 K. AES peaks are used to track the oxidation of Sn.

1. 对于（3×3）R30 Sn/Pt(1 1 1) 表面合金上NO2的吸附进行了研究，使用了包括TPD、AES、HREELS和LEED在内的多种技术。在120 K下，NO2以分子二聚体N2O4的形式被吸附，通过表面单个氧原子与之相互作用，在垂直但倾斜的位置。这个二聚体不会从单层状态分子地脱附。加热到300 K时，二聚体分解，留下NO2、NO和O在表面上。进一步的NO2吸附分解为NO和O发生在300-400 K之间。通过在600 K下对N2O4单层进行加热，可以增加氧原子覆盖率达到1.1 ML，前提是消除了共吸附的NO的抑制。通过AES峰跟踪Sn的氧化。

2. 加热N2O4单层获得的最大氧原子覆盖率为θO=0.4 ML，但是通过在600 K下向合金表面施加NO2，可以去除共吸附NO的抑制，将覆盖率增加至θO=1.1 ML。
