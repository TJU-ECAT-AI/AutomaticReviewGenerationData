INTRODUCTION
Furfuryl alcohol is an important intermediate for the polymer industry. It is used mainly for the production of furan resin, phenolic resin and furfuryl resin. At present, furfuryl alcohol is prepared mainly by the catalytic hydrogenation of furfural in gaseous or liquid phase.14 A commercial process is the liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural over CuCr catalyst. However, the toxicity, high energy consumption and moderate activity of this catalyst provide a challenge to develop a new high-efficiency catalyst without chromium. Recently, a few works concerning the gaseous *Correspondence to: Ying Zheng, College of Chemistry and Materials Science, Fujian Normal University, Fuzhou, Fujian 35007, Peoples Republic of China.

phase hydrogenation of furfural over carbon-supported copper,1,5 Raney nickel,6 nickel amorphous alloys,79 mixed copperzinc oxides doped with Al, Mn and Fe10 and homogeneous complexes of Rh, Ru and Pt11 have been published, but the selectivity of these catalysts still does not reach commercial requirements. Therefore, the development of highly selective catalysts is currently a crucial goal.
Platinum is a known hydrogenation catalyst. However,platinum can usually catalyze deep hydrogenation and activate undesired side and consecutive reactions. Very recently, Kijenski12 reported that platinum deposited on supports (SiO2, γ -Al2O3, MgO, TiO2) covered with a transition metal oxide monolayer (TiO2, V2O5, ZrO2) had high selectivity for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol at temperatures from 423 to 573 K. The difference between the electronegativity of Pt and that of the transitional metal resulted in a strong polarization of the catalyst surface, which was considered to be the reason for the high selectivity.
Herein, we attempt to alter the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation via formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex in the channel pores of zeolites. This concept has been demonstrated by the Copyright 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The structure of the surface species was characterized by XRD, CO-TPD, in situ FTIR and XPS. The selective hydrogenation of furfural as a model reaction was used to examine the catalytic properties of the surface complex. It was found that the catalyst showed better performance in comparison with the parent Pt/NaY.
This study will provide a theoretical basis for designing at molecular level a catalyst for highly selective hydrogenation of furfural.
EXPERIMENTAL
Materials NH4Y zeolite was obtained from Aldrich (Si : Al = 5.0).
Tetramethyltin (SnMe4, 99.5%) was purchased from Aldrich.
H2PtCl6 · 6H2O (AR grade) was purchased from Shanghai Chem. Co.
Preparation of the Pt/NaY zeolite NH4Y zeolite was calcined at 793 K under flowing oxygen for 10 h to completely transform it into HY zeolite. NaY zeolite was prepared by the treatment of HY zeolite with a dilute solution of NaOH at 353 K for 2 h. The resulting solid was dried in air overnight at 373 K, and calcined at 773 K for 2 h. Then the NaY zeolite was immersed in the appropriate amount of an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 · 6H2O (AR grade) at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting powder was dried in air overnight at 383 K, and then incessantly heated in tube furnace with a ramping of 1 K min1 to 473, 573,623 and 673 K and maintained at each temperature for 0.5 h.
Subsequently, the temperature increased from 673 to 773 K.
After holding for 4 h, the sample was flushed with N2 and reduced under H2 for 5 h at this temperature. When the temperature decreased to room temperature, the sample was transferred into a desiccator filled with He. The as-prepared Pt/NaY zeolite was used as a starting material for preparing organotin-grafted samples.
Preparation of (Me)3SnPt/NaY The amount of Pt/NaY zeolite was enclosed in home- made glass equipment and treated under dynamic vacuum (0.133 Pa) at 673 K for 3 h. After cooling to room temperature,the reactor was filled with
1.6 × 104 Pa
of hydrogen.
Subsequently, an amount of liquid tetramethyltin was introduced to the reaction system with a syringe via a septum. The reactor was kept at the temperature 373 K for 24 h to ensure a complete reaction. The evolved gases were analyzed by gas phase chromatogram (GC). Elimination of hydrogen and unreacted SnMe4 was achieved by treatment under vacuum at this temperature for 1 h.
The reaction was also monitored by in situ infrared spectroscopy. A 2030 mg aliquot of Pt/NaY zeolite was pressed as a disk (diameter 18 mm) and used to redo the experiment under the same conditions as above.
Physico-chemical characterization The evolved gases were analyzed using an Agilent 6890 GC equipped with an FID detector. The chromatography used a HP-PLOT Al2O3 capillary column. The supporting gas was He.
The content of tin in the resulting solid was determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) after the sample was dissolved completely using diluted hydrochloric acid and a small amount of hydrofluoric acid. The ICP measurements were carried out using a model ICPQ-100. The content of carbon in the resulting solid was analyzed using a Vario EL III elemental analyzer (EA).
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed with a Brucker Advance D8 X-ray power diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA) at a scan speed of 0.2 in increments of 0.02.2θ.
In situ infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 670 FTIR Spectrometer. The BET surface area was detected by N2 adsorption with an OMNISORP 100CX gas adsorb analyzer.
XPS spectra were recorded on a PHI-5300/ESCA Spec- trometer (Al/Mg dianode, 0.8 eV energy resolution, 45angle resolution and 80 kCPS sensitivity). The base pressure was maintained at 2.0 × 107 Pa during XPS analysis (energy
3.0 kV, current 25 mA). Powder samples were mounted on
sample stubs with conductive carbon tape. The sputtering was operated at 30 kV, 25 mA and 4 nm min1, and argon ion bombardment was used. The analyzed area was 8 × 8 mm2.
The C 1s line (284.6 eV) was used as the reference to calculate the binding energies (BE).
Experiments of temperature-programmed CO desorption (CO-TPD) was performed on an Autochem 2910 automatic catalyst characterization system. The loading amount of the sample was 0.2000 g. The flow rate of the supporting gas (He for TPD) was 30 ml min1 and the heating rate was 5 K min1.
Catalytic activity tests The catalytic tests were performed in a home made glass reactor (i.d. 18 mm) with a thermocouple under atmosphere pressure. Catalyst was packed into the reactor and pretreated with hydrogen from room temperature to 423 K at a heating rate of 5 K min1. The furfural liquid was added into the hydrogen steam using a peristaltic pump. The reactant mixture was passed through the reactor.
The reaction products were cooled and analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890 GC) equipped with an FID detector. The chromatograph used an HP-FFAP Copyright 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The reactivity of SnMe4 on Pt/NaY zeolite The FTIR spectra of HY zeolite in the range of 40002400 cm1 is shown in Fig. 1. After treatment under dynamic vacuum at 673 K for 3 h, zeolite showed three vibration adsorption bands at 3744, 3669 and 3600 cm1, which could be assigned to external non-acidic silanol groups, supercage acidic hydroxyl groups and inaccessible other acidic hydroxyl groups [Fig. 1(a)],18 respectively. However, both supercage acidic hydroxyls at 3669 cm1 and acidic hydroxyls at 3600 cm1 in Pt/NaY zeolite are largely decreased [Fig. 1(b)],indicating that a majority of acidic hydroxyls are eliminated by OH. When SnMe4 is contacted with Pt/NaY zeolite at 353 K, and kept at this temperature for 24 h under vacuum conditions, supercage acidic hydroxyl groups disappear completely, and CH stretching vibration adsorptions of methyl and methylene appear at 28003000 cm1 [Fig. 1(d)].
Gas chromatography analysis revealed that per gram Pt/NaY zeolite (2% of Pt) reacting with excess of SnMe4 under the same conditions as above resulted in 0.11 mmol of MeH. It indicated that SnMe4 reacted with remanent supercage acid hydroxyls at this temperature.15 After the unreacted SnMe4 and gaseous products are removed, 1.6 × 104 Pa of hydrogen and excess SnMe4 are introduced into the reaction system at 353 K, and held for 24 h at this temperature in the hydrogen atmosphere, the band intensity at 28003000 cm1 clearly increased [Fig. 1(e)], while the acidic hydroxyls at 3600 cm1 did not change. In the meantime, 0.10 mmol of MeH was obtained. This indicates that SnMe4 reacts with absorbed hydrogen,19 thereby the second grafting reaction occurs on the surface Pt atoms of Pt/NaY zeolite.
Pt Hads + SnMe4
Pt-SnMe3 + MeH (1) Some evident change could be observed from the IR spectrum of CO chemisorption at 293 K (Fig. 2). For the parent Pt/NaY zeolite [Fig. 2(a)], its IR spectrum in the range 17502200 cm1 was composed of two IR bands,one, which was assignable to the PtCO linear vibrator,appeared at 2060 cm1; the other, which was attributed to bridged CO species, occurred at 1870 cm1.2024 However,after the second grafting reaction, the bridged CO band at 1870 cm1 disappeared. This indicates indirectly that a majority of Pt atoms react with SnMe4 to form bimetallic PtSn organometallic complexes, while those unreacted Pt atoms on the surface of NaY zeolite may be highly isolated. In the meantime, the band at 2060 cm1 shifts to low wavenumbers due to the increasing electron feedback from metal to CO molecules, and its absorption intensity clearly decreases. These change suggest that the electronic properties of Pt atoms on surface of NaY zeolite are altered by the introduction of tetramethyltin.
Structural characterization of the modified sample Comparison of the XRD patterns of Pt/NaY and the modified Pt/NaY sample (Fig. 3) shows that their structures are essentially the same and the diffraction intensity changes slightly, which suggests that the grafting reaction does not destroy the framework structure and the reaction occurs only on the surface of zeolite. The texture parameters (Table 1) showed that the Pt/NaY zeolite retained the microporous characteristics after modification.

CO-TPD profiles of NaY zeolite before and after modification. decreased remarkably, indicating that the surface properties of the Pt/NaY zeolite changed after the reaction.
CO-TPD and XPS characterization of the modified sample Figure 4 presents TPD spectra of CO on NaY, Pt/NaY and Me3SnPt/NaY. The CO-TPD profiles of these samples consist of only a broad desorption peak in the 350900 K region. Obviously, the higher temperature of CO desorption on Pt-modified NaY zeolite was obtained due to the strong adsorption between CO and Pt in comparison with the parent NaY zeolite. However, after the modification, the CO desorption temperature decreased because of the existence of organotin surface complex, and even the initial desorption temperature was lower than that of NaY. This indicates that the grafting reaction results in reducing surface adsorption capacity of Pt atoms, further confirming that the electronic properties of Pt atoms change after modification. The XPS analytic result on the Me3SnPt/NaY Sample also confirms this.
As is listed in Table 2, for Pt/NaY, the binding energy of Pt (4f7/2) equals 71.50 eV. However, after SnMe4 was grafted onto Pt atoms in Pt/NaY zeolite, the binding energy of Pt (4f7/2) split into 71.20 and 74.68 eV.25,26 This change in the binding energy confirms that SnMe4 reacts with Pt atoms in Pt/NaY zeolite, and shows that two different Pt species exist in the supercages of NaY zeolite.27 This is in agreement with the above IR results of CO chemisorption. The binding energies of Sn3d3/2 and Sn3d5/2 are 495.48 and 486.98 eV, respectively.28,29 The difference between these values is 8.50 eV, indicating that tin exists in the form of Sn4+, but not in the form of Sn0.30,31 Catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of furfural The above experimental results show that a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface complex in NaY zeolite can be successfully prepared by the grafting reaction of SnMe4 with Pt atoms in the H2 atmosphere. It is well known that methyl is an organic group with ample electrons. In principle, it can transfer electrons to Pt atom by the intermediate Sn atoms so as to increase the electron density around Pt atom, consequently weakening the absorption of Pt atom to hydrogen. Theoretically, the inductive effect of electrons between methyl and Pt inevitably impairs the hydrogenation ability of Pt to unsaturate hydrocarbons. Enhancement of the selectivity of hydrogenation of Pt may be realized.
In order to validate above theoretical deduction, as- synthesized bimetallic Me3SnPt/NaY was used to catalyze the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The primary experiment results are listed in Table 3. Despite there being no significant change in the conversion ratio of Furfural,it is worth noting that the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol was enhanced prominently in comparison with that of Pt/NaY zeolite. It can be seen from the above experimental results that, for as-synthesized bimetallic Me3SnPt/NaY,notwithstanding that some unreacted Pt atoms and Me3SnO complexes exist in the supercage of NaY zeolite, surely the Me3SnO complexes is not responsible for the reaction,and those unreacted Pt atoms also do not play a role Table 2.

in enhancing the selectivity since Pt atoms can catalyze deep furfural hydrogenation.32 Indeed, a key factor is the surface Me3SnPt complexes. In addition, the stereo effect of methyl may be propitious to producing unsaturated alcohol (UOL).33 Comprehensive evaluation of catalysis activity and optimization of the synthesis conditions will be further investigated in later work.
CONCLUSION
Pt atoms of Pt/NaY zeolite can react with tetramethyltin to form a bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species in the presence of hydrogen at 353 K. Per-gram Pt/NaY (2% of Pt) reacting with excessive of SnMe4 at 353 K for 24 h results in 0.085 mmol Sn grafted on the surface of Pt atoms. After modification,the crystal structure of Pt/NaY zeolite is not destroyed, but the surface properties are changed. The BET surface area and the pore volume of zeolite decrease, while the microporous structure is retained. The CO chemisorption results and the XPS results show that the electronic properties of the modified Pt atoms on surface of NaY zeolite are altered remarkably by the inductive effect of electrons between Pt and methyl groups, consequently weakening the deep hydrogenation ability of Pt to furfural, and enhancing the selectivity of furfuryl alcohol. The bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species is responsible for the enhancement of the selectivity.
