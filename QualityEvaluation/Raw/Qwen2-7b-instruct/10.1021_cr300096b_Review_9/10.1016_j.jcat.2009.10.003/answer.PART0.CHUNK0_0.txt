[1] "The trends in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein are reported here on several subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures."
[2] "The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields."
[3] "The highest hydrogenation activity of acrolein and yield toward the 2-propenol are observed on the H/PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, in agreement with the preferred di-r-CO adsorption mode of acrolein from the HREELS measurement."
[4] "Recent DFT modeling results indicate that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen, suggesting that surface science results from the current study should be relevant to hydrogenation activities of supported 3dPt bimetallic catalysts."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by providing a more efficient and selective method to convert aldehydes into alcohols. This process allows for the production of valuable intermediates for fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains involve the use of techniques like temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling.

2. In the context of the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst system, the hydrogenation of C═O bonds demonstrates a clear trend where the hydrogenation activity increases from PtCuPt(1 1 1) to PtCoPt(1 1 1) and then to PtNiPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields. This trend is attributed to the interaction of acrolein with the catalyst surface, with the PtNiPt(1 1 1) system showing the highest activity and yield towards the formation of 2-propenol, in line with the preferred di-r-CO adsorption mode of acrolein.

3. The Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst system displays a similar trend in hydrogenation activity and selectivity compared to the Pt-Co system, despite differences in the absolute yield. This is in agreement with the general similarity in the TPD spectra for both bimetallic systems and the fact that the PtCoPt(1 1 1) system, with and without pre-adsorbed hydrogen, exhibits the second highest overall hydrogenation activity and yield towards 2-propenol among the bimetallic series reported in the study.

4. The study provides insights into the hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, which can inform the design of supported 3dPt bimetallic catalysts. Recent DFT modeling results suggest that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. This implies that the surface science results from the current study should be applicable to the understanding and optimization of hydrogenation activities of supported 3dPt bimetallic catalysts, potentially leading to enhanced performance in industrial applications.

1. 在工业和研究应用中，特别是利用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化，为精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化提供了更高效、选择性更高的方法。这种方法允许生产有价值的中间体用于精细化学品和药物前体。在理论和实验领域研究、优化和提高该过程的选择性和效率的方法包括使用温度程序脱附（TPD）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和密度泛函理论（DFT）建模技术。

2. 在Pt-Ni双金属催化剂体系的背景下，C═O键的氢化显示出清晰的趋势，氢化活性从PtCuPt(1 1 1)到PtCoPt(1 1 1)再到PtNiPt(1 1 1)逐渐增加，基于TPD产率。这种趋势归因于丙酮与催化剂表面的相互作用，其中PtNiPt(1 1 1)系统显示出最高的活性和产率，形成2-丙烯醇，与丙酮在表面的首选di-r-CO吸附模式一致。

3. Pt-Ni双金属催化剂体系在氢化活性和选择性方面表现出相似的趋势，尽管绝对产率存在差异。这与两种双金属系统的TPD光谱的一致性相吻合，并且考虑到PtCoPt(1 1 1)系统，在预吸附氢的情况下，具有第二高的总体氢化活性和向2-丙烯醇的产率，这是在研究中报告的系列中报告的。

4. 当前的研究提供了关于丙酮在Pt基双金属表面上的氢化的信息，这可以指导支持的3dPt双金属催化剂的设计。最近的DFT模型结果表明，带有吸附氢的Pt3dPt亚表面结构是热力学上优选的。这意味着当前研究的表面科学结果应该适用于理解和优化支持的3dPt双金属催化剂的氢化活性，可能在工业应用中导致性能增强。
