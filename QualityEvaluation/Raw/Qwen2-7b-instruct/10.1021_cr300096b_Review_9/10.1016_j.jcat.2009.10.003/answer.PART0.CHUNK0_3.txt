[1] "Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
[2] "The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields."
[3] "The overall hydrogenation activity and selec- tivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."
[4] "The main hydrogenated products on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surface structures are also calculated and reported in Table 2. Due to the absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen, the production of propanal and 2-propenol on these surfaces is from the self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reaction of acrolein."
[5] "In comparison, the overall hydrogenation activity was the highest for the Ni/SiO2 catalyst."
[6] "Recent DFT modeling results indicate that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen, suggesting that surface science results from the current study should be relevant to hydro- genation activities of supported 3dPt bimetallic catalysts."

1. Acrolein serves as a probe molecule to investigate the impact of 3d transition metals, either on the surface or in the subsurface area of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate, on the hydrogenation activity towards C@C and C@O bonds.
2. The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures shows a trend of Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields.
3. The study focuses on understanding the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity towards the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.
4. The production of propanal and 2-propenol on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces is primarily through self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) reactions of acrolein due to the absence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.
5. The overall hydrogenation activity was the highest for the Ni/SiO2 catalyst compared to other systems.
6. Surface science findings from the study suggest that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures, with adsorbed hydrogen, are thermodynamically preferred, which implies that the results are applicable to supported 3dPt bimetallic catalyst hydrogenation activities.

1. 丙烯醛作为探针分子，用于研究3d过渡金属（无论是在铂（1 1 1）晶面的表面还是在亚表面区域）对C@C和C@O键氢化活性的影响。
2. 在亚表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)结构上，氢化活性呈现出以下趋势：Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1)，基于TPD产率。
3. 研究集中在理解3d/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面的整体氢化活性和选择性，针对相应的不饱和醇（2-丙烯醇）。
4. 缺乏预吸附氢的情况下，3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面通过自身氢化（分解）反应生成丙烯醛和2-丙烯醇。
5. 整体氢化活性最高的是Ni/SiO2催化剂。
6. 表面科学研究结果表明，带有吸附氢的Pt3dPt亚表面结构是热力学上更优选的，这意味着当前研究结果适用于支持的3dPt双金属催化剂的氢化活性。
