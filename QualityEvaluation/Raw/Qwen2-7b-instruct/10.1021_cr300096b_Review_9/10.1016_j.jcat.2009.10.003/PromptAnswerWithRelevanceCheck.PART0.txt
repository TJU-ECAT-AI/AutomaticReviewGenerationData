1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by providing a more efficient and selective method to convert aldehydes into alcohols. This process allows for the production of valuable intermediates for fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains involve the use of techniques like temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling.

2. In the context of the Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst system, the hydrogenation of C═O bonds demonstrates a clear trend where the hydrogenation activity increases from PtCuPt(1 1 1) to PtCoPt(1 1 1) and then to PtNiPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields. This trend is attributed to the interaction of acrolein with the catalyst surface, with the PtNiPt(1 1 1) system showing the highest activity and yield towards the formation of 2-propenol, in line with the preferred di-r-CO adsorption mode of acrolein.

3. The Pt-Ni bimetallic catalyst system displays a similar trend in hydrogenation activity and selectivity compared to the Pt-Co system, despite differences in the absolute yield. This is in agreement with the general similarity in the TPD spectra for both bimetallic systems and the fact that the PtCoPt(1 1 1) system, with and without pre-adsorbed hydrogen, exhibits the second highest overall hydrogenation activity and yield towards 2-propenol among the bimetallic series reported in the study.

4. The study provides insights into the hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces, which can inform the design of supported 3dPt bimetallic catalysts. Recent DFT modeling results suggest that the Pt3dPt subsurface structures are thermodynamically preferred with adsorbed hydrogen. This implies that the surface science results from the current study should be applicable to the understanding and optimization of hydrogenation activities of supported 3dPt bimetallic catalysts, potentially leading to enhanced performance in industrial applications.

1. 在工业和研究应用中，特别是利用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化，为精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化提供了更高效、选择性更高的方法。这种方法允许生产有价值的中间体用于精细化学品和药物前体。在理论和实验领域研究、优化和提高该过程的选择性和效率的方法包括使用温度程序脱附（TPD）、高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）和密度泛函理论（DFT）建模技术。

2. 在Pt-Ni双金属催化剂体系的背景下，C═O键的氢化显示出清晰的趋势，氢化活性从PtCuPt(1 1 1)到PtCoPt(1 1 1)再到PtNiPt(1 1 1)逐渐增加，基于TPD产率。这种趋势归因于丙酮与催化剂表面的相互作用，其中PtNiPt(1 1 1)系统显示出最高的活性和产率，形成2-丙烯醇，与丙酮在表面的首选di-r-CO吸附模式一致。

3. Pt-Ni双金属催化剂体系在氢化活性和选择性方面表现出相似的趋势，尽管绝对产率存在差异。这与两种双金属系统的TPD光谱的一致性相吻合，并且考虑到PtCoPt(1 1 1)系统，在预吸附氢的情况下，具有第二高的总体氢化活性和向2-丙烯醇的产率，这是在研究中报告的系列中报告的。

4. 当前的研究提供了关于丙酮在Pt基双金属表面上的氢化的信息，这可以指导支持的3dPt双金属催化剂的设计。最近的DFT模型结果表明，带有吸附氢的Pt3dPt亚表面结构是热力学上优选的。这意味着当前研究的表面科学结果应该适用于理解和优化支持的3dPt双金属催化剂的氢化活性，可能在工业应用中导致性能增强。

Trend in the C@C and C@O bond hydrogenation of acrolein on PtM (M = Ni, Co, Cu) bimetallic surfaces Luis E. Murillo a,1, Carl A. Menning b, Jingguang G. Chen b,* a Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States b Department of Chemical Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 9 July 2009 Revised 23 September 2009 Accepted 1 October 2009 Available online 31 October 2009 Keywords: Bimetallic Acrolein Ni Co Cu Pt(1 1 1) Selective hydrogenation

Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selec- tivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.

The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields. The absolute yield toward 2- propenol is also the highest on PtNiPt(1 1 1), which is further enhanced by the presence of pre- adsorbed hydrogen.

In contrast, the selective hydrogenation does not occur on the surface monolayer 3dPt(1 1 1) structures. The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibra- tional features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPt(1 1 1) structures.

In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes on catalysts without the effect of the catalyst support, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been carried out by adding Sn to Pt(5 5 3) [9] and Sn, Fe, and Ni to Pt(1 1 1) [2,3,1018].

In the current paper we extend our studies to other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, including Co and Cu, to determine the general trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures.

1. The trend in the hydrogenation activity of acrolein towards C@C and C@O bonds on PtM (M = Ni, Co, Cu) bimetallic surfaces shows that the hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures is higher than on the corresponding surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures. Specifically, the trend based on TPD yields is: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1). The highest yield towards the corresponding unsaturated alcohol, 2-propenol, is observed on PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, further enhanced by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.

2. The trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces is influenced by the binding energy of acrolein on the surface and the interaction of the carbonyl group with the bimetallic surfaces. The stronger binding energy favors the dissociation of the skeletal bonds of acrolein on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces, which diminishes the interaction of the carbonyl group with the bimetallic surfaces, leading to lower hydrogenation activity and yield towards 2-propenol.

3. The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibrational features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPt(1 1 1) structures, supporting the trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

4. The hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are studied using TPD, HREELS, and DFT modeling. These methodologies are employed to understand the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on the bimetallic surfaces.

5. The current paper extends the studies to other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, including Co and Cu, to determine the general trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures.

1. Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) 表明在PtM（M = Ni，Co，Cu）双金属表面中，向C@C和C@O键氢化活性的子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)结构高于相应的表面3dPtPt(1 1 1)结构。具体而言，基于TPD产率的趋势是：Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1)。在PtNiPt(1 1 1)表面上观察到最高产率的对应不饱和醇，2-丙烯醇，进一步通过预吸附的氢增强。

2. 在3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面上，由于更强的结合能有利于丙烯醛骨架键的分解，这减弱了羰基团与双金属表面的相互作用，导致2-丙烯醇的氢化活性和产率降低的趋势影响了丙烯醛在Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面的氢化活性和选择性。

3. 根据TPD结果与在子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和表面3dPt(1 1 1)结构上吸附和反应后的不同振动特征的HREELS测量一致，支持了丙烯醛在双金属表面的氢化活性和选择性的趋势。

4. 使用TPD，HREELS和DFT建模方法来理解丙烯醛在双金属表面的整体氢化活性和选择性趋势。

5. 当前论文扩展研究到其他3d/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面，包括Co和Cu，以确定在子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和表面3dPtPt(1 1 1)结构上的丙烯醛氢化活性和选择性的普遍趋势。
