<p>The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields.</p>
<p>The absolute yield toward 2-propenol is also the highest on PtNiPt(1 1 1), which is further enhanced by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.</p>
<p>In contrast, the selective hydrogenation does not occur on the surface monolayer 3dPt(1 1 1) structures.</p>
<p>The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibrational features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPt(1 1 1) structures.</p>
<p>In addition, DFT calculations suggest that the different hydrogenation activities between the subsurface and surface structures appear to be related to the differences in the binding energy of acrolein on the corresponding bimetallic surfaces.</p>

The study examines the catalytic hydrogenation of acrolein on Pt-based bimetallic surfaces. The hydrogenation activity on subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures follows the trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1), as indicated by TPD yields. The highest yield towards 2-propenol is observed on the PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, further enhanced by pre-adsorbed hydrogen. Selective hydrogenation does not occur on surface monolayer 3dPt(1 1 1) structures. The TPD results align with HREELS measurements of vibrational features after acrolein adsorption and reaction on the surfaces. DFT calculations attribute the varying hydrogenation activities to differences in the binding energy of acrolein on the bimetallic surfaces.

本研究考察了在Pt基双金属表面催化氢化丙烯醛的情况。在子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)结构上，氢化活性遵循这样的趋势：Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1)，由TPD产率指示。在PtNiPt(1 1 1)表面上，2-丙烯醇的最高产率被观察到，并且通过预先吸附的氢进一步增强。表面单层3dPt(1 1 1)结构上没有选择性氢化。TPD结果与吸附和反应后在子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和表面3dPt(1 1 1)结构上的振动特征测量一致。第一性原理计算将不同的氢化活性归因于相应的双金属表面上丙烯醛结合能的不同。
