[1] "Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
[2] "The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields."
[3] "The presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen enhances the production of 2-propenol from the PtNiPt(1 1 1) and PtCoPt(1 1 1) surfaces."
[4] "The trends in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein are reported here on several subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures."
[5] "The combination of TPD and HREELS experiments and DFT calculations leads to the following conclusions:(1) TPD experiments show that a higher activity toward self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) and hydrogenation of acrolein is observed on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures in comparison with that observed on the corresponding surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures."

1. Acrolein is utilized as a probe molecule to investigate the influence of 3d transition metals on the hydrogenation activity towards C@C and C@O bonds, both on the surface and in the subsurface area of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate.

2. The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures follows the trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1), as determined by TPD yields.

3. The addition of pre-adsorbed hydrogen significantly boosts the production of 2-propenol from PtNiPt(1 1 1) and PtCoPt(1 1 1) surfaces.

4. Trends regarding the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein are explored on various subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures.

5. TPD experiments reveal that the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures exhibit higher activity for self-hydrogenation (disproportionation) and acrolein hydrogenation in comparison to the corresponding surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures.
