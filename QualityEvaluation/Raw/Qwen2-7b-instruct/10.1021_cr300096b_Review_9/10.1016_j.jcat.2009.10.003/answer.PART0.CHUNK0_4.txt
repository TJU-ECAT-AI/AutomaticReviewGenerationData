Trend in the C@C and C@O bond hydrogenation of acrolein on PtM (M = Ni, Co, Cu) bimetallic surfaces Luis E. Murillo a,1, Carl A. Menning b, Jingguang G. Chen b,* a Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States b Department of Chemical Engineering, Center for Catalytic Science and Technology, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716, United States a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 9 July 2009 Revised 23 September 2009 Accepted 1 October 2009 Available online 31 October 2009 Keywords: Bimetallic Acrolein Ni Co Cu Pt(1 1 1) Selective hydrogenation

Acrolein, the smallest a,b-unsaturated aldehyde, is used as a probe molecule to study the effect on the hydrogenation activity toward the C@C and C@O bonds due to the presence of a 3d transition metal either on the surface or in the subsurface region of a Pt(1 1 1) substrate. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling are used to help explain the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selec- tivity toward the corresponding unsaturated alcohol (2-propenol) on the 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.

The hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures displays the following trend: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) based on the TPD yields. The absolute yield toward 2- propenol is also the highest on PtNiPt(1 1 1), which is further enhanced by the presence of pre- adsorbed hydrogen.

In contrast, the selective hydrogenation does not occur on the surface monolayer 3dPt(1 1 1) structures. The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibra- tional features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPt(1 1 1) structures.

In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of a,b-unsaturated aldehydes on catalysts without the effect of the catalyst support, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been carried out by adding Sn to Pt(5 5 3) [9] and Sn, Fe, and Ni to Pt(1 1 1) [2,3,1018].

In the current paper we extend our studies to other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, including Co and Cu, to determine the general trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures.

1. The trend in the hydrogenation activity of acrolein towards C@C and C@O bonds on PtM (M = Ni, Co, Cu) bimetallic surfaces shows that the hydrogenation activity on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) structures is higher than on the corresponding surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures. Specifically, the trend based on TPD yields is: Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1). The highest yield towards the corresponding unsaturated alcohol, 2-propenol, is observed on PtNiPt(1 1 1) surface, further enhanced by the presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen.

2. The trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces is influenced by the binding energy of acrolein on the surface and the interaction of the carbonyl group with the bimetallic surfaces. The stronger binding energy favors the dissociation of the skeletal bonds of acrolein on the 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces, which diminishes the interaction of the carbonyl group with the bimetallic surfaces, leading to lower hydrogenation activity and yield towards 2-propenol.

3. The TPD results are consistent with HREELS measurements of different vibrational features after the adsorption and reaction of acrolein on the subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPt(1 1 1) structures, supporting the trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity.

4. The hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on the Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and 3dPtPt(1 1 1) surfaces are studied using TPD, HREELS, and DFT modeling. These methodologies are employed to understand the trend in the overall hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on the bimetallic surfaces.

5. The current paper extends the studies to other 3d/Pt(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces, including Co and Cu, to determine the general trend in the hydrogenation activity and selectivity of acrolein on subsurface Pt3dPt(1 1 1) and surface 3dPtPt(1 1 1) structures.

1. Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1) 表明在PtM（M = Ni，Co，Cu）双金属表面中，向C@C和C@O键氢化活性的子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)结构高于相应的表面3dPtPt(1 1 1)结构。具体而言，基于TPD产率的趋势是：Pt NiPt(1 1 1) > PtCoPt(1 1 1) > PtCuPt(1 1 1)。在PtNiPt(1 1 1)表面上观察到最高产率的对应不饱和醇，2-丙烯醇，进一步通过预吸附的氢增强。

2. 在3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面上，由于更强的结合能有利于丙烯醛骨架键的分解，这减弱了羰基团与双金属表面的相互作用，导致2-丙烯醇的氢化活性和产率降低的趋势影响了丙烯醛在Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和3dPtPt(1 1 1)表面的氢化活性和选择性。

3. 根据TPD结果与在子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和表面3dPt(1 1 1)结构上吸附和反应后的不同振动特征的HREELS测量一致，支持了丙烯醛在双金属表面的氢化活性和选择性的趋势。

4. 使用TPD，HREELS和DFT建模方法来理解丙烯醛在双金属表面的整体氢化活性和选择性趋势。

5. 当前论文扩展研究到其他3d/Pt(1 1 1)双金属表面，包括Co和Cu，以确定在子表面Pt3dPt(1 1 1)和表面3dPtPt(1 1 1)结构上的丙烯醛氢化活性和选择性的普遍趋势。
