The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni systems, significantly contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. In this context, the study focused on the synthesis and confinement of PtRu nanoparticles for hydrogenation applications. These nanoparticles, when confined in functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), exhibited higher catalytic activity and selectivity than unsupported nanoparticles. The choice of solvent, especially supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), influenced the size and shape of the nanoparticles, serving as both a medium for preparation and a stabilizing agent. The study highlighted that phosphine-stabilized PtRu nanoparticles confined within MWCNTs showed more agglomeration than those stabilized by pyridine ligands. These confined catalysts were applied to the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, achieving higher selectivity due to the larger particle size observed in the confined systems.

在Pt-Ni系统等双金属催化剂的作用下，C═O键的催化氢化对精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业与研究领域具有重要意义。本研究主要关注铂铑纳米粒子的合成及其在氢化反应中的应用。当这些纳米粒子被限制在功能性多壁碳纳米管（MWCNT）中时，它们显示出比未支撑纳米粒子更高的催化活性和选择性。溶剂的选择，特别是超临界二氧化碳（scCO2），影响了纳米粒子的大小和形状，并作为制备过程中的介质和稳定剂。研究表明，用磷配体稳定并限制在MWCNT中的铂铑纳米粒子比使用吡啶配体的纳米粒子更容易团聚。这些限制的催化剂被应用于肉桂醛的氢化，由于在限制系统中观察到的较大颗粒尺寸，实现了更高的选择性。
