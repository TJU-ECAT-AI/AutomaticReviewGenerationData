The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ru systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve both theoretical and experimental approaches. The study of the behavior of these bimetallic nanoparticles under different conditions, such as in supercritical CO2 versus THF solvents, provides insights into their catalytic performance. Confined nanoparticles, especially those stabilized by phosphine ligands, exhibit higher catalytic activity and selectivity compared to unsupported nanoparticles. The enhanced activity and selectivity can be attributed to the increased local concentration of reactants and catalyst inside multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). This phenomenon facilitates the displacement of the equilibrium between ligands and reactants, thereby enhancing the adsorption of reactants and catalytic activity. The confinement of nanoparticles within the inner cavity of MWCNTs impacts properties at both the mesoscopic and microscopic scales, leading to improved catalytic performance.

催化氢化C═O键使用铂-钌等双金属催化剂对工业和研究应用，如精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化具有重大贡献。用于研究、优化和增强此过程选择性和效率的方法包括理论和实验方法。研究这些双金属纳米颗粒在不同条件下的行为提供了对其催化性能的见解。在超临界二氧化碳与四氢呋喃溶剂中合成的纳米颗粒表现出不同的聚集性，但催化性能没有显著差异。被磷配体稳定化的封闭纳米颗粒比无支撑纳米颗粒表现出更高的催化活性和选择性。这种增强的活性和选择性可以归因于纳米颗粒在多壁碳纳米管（MWCNT）内部的局部浓度增加。这促进了配体和反应物之间的平衡位移，从而增强了反应物的吸附能力和催化活性。将纳米颗粒封闭在MWCNT的内腔中影响了宏观和微观尺度上的性质，导致了更好的催化性能。
