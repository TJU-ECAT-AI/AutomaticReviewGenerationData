[1] "The application of metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) as catalysts has undergone an exponential growth during the last decade."
[2] "Immobilised on solid supports, such as carbon, inorganic oxides (e.g., silica, alumina, titanium dioxide), and polymeric materials, they have been applied to a number of catalytic transformations,710 and are easily separated from the organic product for recovery and reuse."
[3] "Notably, the catalytic activity and selectivity could be modified by changing the support."
[4] "Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have proven to be good catalyst supports, owing to their specificity: 1)high catalytic activities owing to their mesoporous nature, which avoids mass transfer limitations;12 2)high activity and selectivity owing to the confinement effect of their inner cavity;13 3)well-defined and tuneable structures;14 and 4)selective growth of nanocarbons by use of catalytic chemical vapour deposition on defined substrates to build nanoreactors.15"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni systems, significantly contributes to industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the selective and efficient transformation of organic compounds, which is crucial in pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and renewable energy industries. The methodologies employed involve both theoretical and experimental approaches to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process. These methods typically include:

1. **Synthesis and Characterization**: Preparing bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni nanoparticles, and characterizing their properties using techniques like Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), and X-ray Analysis to understand their size, shape, and stability.

2. **Immobilization**: Utilizing solid supports, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), to immobilize the catalysts. CNTs offer high catalytic activity due to their mesoporous structure, confinement effect, well-defined structure, and selective growth capabilities, enhancing the catalyst's performance.

3. **Reaction Optimization**: Conducting hydrogenation reactions under controlled conditions, including temperature, pressure, and solvent choice, to optimize the catalytic efficiency. This involves monitoring the reaction kinetics and product selectivity.

4. **Stability Studies**: Investigating the long-term stability of the catalysts to ensure they can be reused economically in industrial settings.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing the performance of unsupported catalysts versus those immobilized on supports or confined within cavities to understand the impact of support type and confinement on catalytic activity and selectivity.

6. **Theoretical Modeling**: Using computational methods to predict reaction pathways, optimize catalyst design, and understand the mechanism of hydrogenation reactions at the molecular level.

By employing these methodologies, researchers can tailor catalyst properties to achieve desired outcomes in specific chemical transformations, contributing to advancements in various industrial sectors and sustainable chemical processes.
