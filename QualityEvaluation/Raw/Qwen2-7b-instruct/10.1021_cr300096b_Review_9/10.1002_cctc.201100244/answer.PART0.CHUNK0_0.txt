[1] "Although bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized in supercritical CO2 led to more agglomerated materials than those in THF, no important differences were observed in catalysis."
[2] "Confined PtRu nanoparticles showed higher catalytic activity and selectivity than unsupported nanoparticles."
[3] "Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have proven to be good catalyst supports, owing to their specificity: 1)high catalytic activities owing to their mesoporous nature, which avoids mass transfer limitations; 2)high activity and selectivity owing to the confinement effect of their inner cavity; 3)well-defined and tuneable structures; 4)selective growth of nanocarbons by use of catalytic chemical vapour deposition on defined substrates to build nanoreactors."
[4] "The chemical preparation of MNPs often involves the reduction of a metal precursor in the presence of a stabilising agent dissolved in a solvent."
[5] "Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has recently been used as a medium for the preparation of MNPs1922 and the dispersion of nanoparticles over a solid support23 or over MWCNTs.24"

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process enables the selective conversion of organic compounds, leading to the production of valuable intermediates and end products. Methodologies for studying, optimizing, and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve both theoretical and experimental approaches. Theoretical studies often employ computational chemistry methods, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to predict reaction pathways, energies, and mechanisms. These calculations can help in understanding the electronic structure, reactivity, and stability of catalysts, as well as the interactions between reactants, catalysts, and products. Experimentally, researchers synthesize and characterize catalysts using various techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and gas chromatography. They also evaluate the catalytic performance under different reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure, and solvent, to identify optimal parameters for maximum efficiency and selectivity. Additionally, the confinement of bimetallic nanoparticles within multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been shown to improve catalytic activity and selectivity, likely due to the enhanced local concentration of reactants and catalysts within the confined space. This strategy leverages the unique properties of MWCNTs, including their high surface area, mesoporous structure, and ability to confine nanoparticles, to create highly effective and stable catalyst supports.
