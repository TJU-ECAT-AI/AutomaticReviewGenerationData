[2] "It should also be emphasized that in the selective hydrogenation of UA, in addition to the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, the adsorption of both the substrate and the formed crotylalcohol with their olefinic double bond should also be suppressed."
[3] "In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared."
[4] "The aim of this work"
[5] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."
[6] "In these experiments it was interesting to compare the value of x, i.e. the number related to the coordinative unsaturation of tin-containing surface organometallic moieties."
[7] "The highest extent of coordinative unsaturation has been obtained when tin anchoring has been carried out in the presence of excess gas-phase hydrogen."
[8] "The introduction of tin leads to significant increase of both the rate and the SCO selectivity."
[9] "In the presence of small amount of oxygen the value of x is nearly constant and x<1."
[10] "Over Pt/SiO2 undesired decarbonylation reaction takes place, leading to the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO."
[11] "This increase was also observed when the catalyst was reused without its contact to air."
[12] "The lack of positive results in this reaction can be attributed to (i) the steric hindrance of alkyl groups [6] ,[7] , and (ii) the decreased reactivity of the keto carbonyl group compared to the aldehyde one."
[13] "Despite the modest results obtained in this reaction the slight increase of SCO selectivity strongly indicates the involvement of ionic forms of tin formed during the treatment with crotonaldehyde."
[14] "Due to this activation the oxidation of CO over Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts takes place at much lower temperature than over the parent Pt/SiO2."
[15] "At higher CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.81.2, while at low CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.40.5 had the highest activity."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These applications rely on the ability to selectively hydrogenate or oxidize functional groups like aldehydes and CO at low temperatures or with high efficiency. To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers use a variety of methodologies. These include theoretical calculations to predict reaction pathways, kinetic studies to understand reaction rates, and experimental techniques like gas chromatography for product analysis. Theoretical models often involve computational chemistry methods to simulate the interaction of molecules with the catalyst surface. Experiments may involve preparing different catalyst compositions, varying reaction conditions, and monitoring the formation of desired products. The selectivity and efficiency are typically evaluated by measuring the conversion of reactants to products and comparing the yield of specific products relative to the total reaction output. By systematically varying experimental parameters and analyzing the results, researchers can identify optimal conditions for achieving high selectivity and efficiency in the hydrogenation or oxidation processes.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the selective hydrogenation of aldehydes and the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide, which are crucial reactions in the production of various chemicals and fuels. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve understanding the role of promoter species, the formation of ionic interactions between tin and carbonyl groups, and the controlled surface reactions between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum. By tailoring the activity and selectivity of the Pt/SiO2 catalysts through the introduction of tin, researchers can achieve high selectivities for the hydrogenation of aldehyde groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes or the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide. The preparation of supported Sn-Pt catalysts involves using controlled surface reactions to ensure exclusive tin-platinum interactions, which allows for the formation of alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with high Snanch/Pt ratios. This process not only enhances the efficiency of the catalytic reactions but also optimizes the selectivity towards desired products.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, specifically Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications including fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts allow for the selective hydrogenation of aldehyde and ketone groups, which is crucial for the production of alcohols, amides, and other valuable compounds. The optimization of this process involves studying and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalysts. Techniques include modifying the catalyst composition, improving reaction conditions, and utilizing advanced characterization methods to understand the active sites and mechanisms of the catalytic reactions. For instance, the paper discusses how the introduction of tin into a Pt/SiO2 catalyst system can tailor its activity and selectivity, enabling the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide. The experimental evidence indicates that the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites plays a key role in activating both carbonyl groups and the CO molecule, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of the system.
