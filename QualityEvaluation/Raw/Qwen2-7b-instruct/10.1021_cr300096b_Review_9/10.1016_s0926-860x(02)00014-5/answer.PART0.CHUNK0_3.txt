[1] "The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UA) is an important model reaction."
[2] "In the presence of heterogeneous catalysts both the aldehyde and the olefinic double bond of UA can be hydrogenated [1], [2]."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that supported platinum catalysts modified by tin, germanium or iron have much higher selectivities for the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group than the unmodified one [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]."
[4] "With respect to the form of promoters in modified platinum catalysts the role of ionic species has been emphasized [3], [4], [5], [6]."
[5] "It has also been suggested that in supported Sn-Pt catalysts the Snn+carbonyl interaction is responsible for the increased SCO selectivity [5], [6], [7], [8]."
[6] "This interaction, as shown in Scheme 1, requires the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, i.e. ionic Snn+ species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface."
[7] "In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared. Details on the preparation of these catalysts and their test results will be summarized in this study."
[8] "The aim of this work is to demonstrate how the activity and selectivity of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst can be tailored by introduction of tin either to hydrogenate the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (UA) or oxidize carbon monoxide at room temperature."
[9] "In Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts, due to the lack of control of interactions involved in the formation of active species, tin is introduced both into the platinum and the support, and the formation of alloy type surface entities cannot be controlled."
[10] "Upon using controlled surface reactions (CSRs) between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum (PtHa), alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with exclusive tin-platinum interaction can be obtained."
[11] "In this approach, due to the use of high initial concentration of tin tetraalkyls, high Snanch/Ms ratios (M=Rh, Pt, etc.) were obtained, but a definite amount of tin was also introduced into the support."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the selective hydrogenation of aldehydes and the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide, which are crucial reactions in the production of various chemicals and fuels. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve understanding the role of promoter species, the formation of ionic interactions between tin and carbonyl groups, and the controlled surface reactions between tin tetraalkyls and hydrogen adsorbed on platinum. By tailoring the activity and selectivity of the Pt/SiO2 catalysts through the introduction of tin, researchers can achieve high selectivities for the hydrogenation of aldehyde groups in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes or the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide. The preparation of supported Sn-Pt catalysts involves using controlled surface reactions to ensure exclusive tin-platinum interactions, which allows for the formation of alloy type supported Sn-Pt catalysts with high Snanch/Pt ratios. This process not only enhances the efficiency of the catalytic reactions but also optimizes the selectivity towards desired products.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用铂-锡双金属催化剂，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业与研究应用产生了重大影响。这一过程允许选择性氢化醛类分子和低温氧化二氧化碳，这对于化学制品和燃料的生产至关重要。为了研究、优化并提高此过程的选择性和效率，人们采用了理解促进剂物种的作用、锡与羰基团之间的离子相互作用以及锡四烷基化合物与吸附在铂上的氢进行受控表面反应的方法。通过调整铂/SiO2催化剂的活性和选择性，引入锡可以实现对α,β-不饱和醛中醛基组分的高选择性氢化或低温氧化二氧化碳。制备支持型Sn-Pt催化剂涉及采用受控表面反应确保仅存在锡-铂相互作用，从而形成具有高Snanch/Pt比的合金型支持Sn-Pt催化剂。这一过程不仅提高了催化反应的效率，而且优化了目标产物的选择性。
