1. "The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UA) is an important model reaction."
2. "It has been demonstrated that supported platinum catalysts modified by tin, germanium or iron have much higher selectivities for the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group than the unmodified one."
3. "This interaction, as shown in Scheme 1 , requires the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, i.e. ionic Snn+ species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface."
4. "In SnO2 supported catalysts a synergism between the oxide and the metal phases has been suggested."
5. "Upon using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4 the following Snanch/Pts ratios were obtained: 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively."
6. "In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared."
7. "The tin anchoring reaction was monitored for 1.57 h by determining the amount of C2H6, C2H4 or CH4 formed, respectively."
8. "Details on the preparation of these catalysts and their test results will be summarized in this study."
9. "The highest extent of coordinative unsaturation has been obtained when tin anchoring has been carried out in the presence of excess gas-phase hydrogen."
10. "Results presented in Table 3 indicate that the Snanch/Pts ratio can be increased substantially under the following experimental conditions of tin anchoring: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4; (ii) prolonged reaction time; (iii) increased reaction temperature; (iv) use of excess hydrogen; (v) addition of oxygen during tin anchoring."
11. "Over Pt/SiO2 undesired decarbonylation reaction takes place, leading to the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO."
12. "In this reaction similar trend has been observed as in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CA, i.e. the introduction of tin strongly increased the reaction rate and led to a very pronounced selectivity increase."
13. "At higher CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.81.2, while at low CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.40.5 had the highest activity."
