[1] "In this paper general aspects of catalyst design based on the use of tin tetraalkyls are described in detail."
[2] "It should also be emphasized that in the selective hydrogenation of UA, in addition to the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, the adsorption of both the substrate and the formed crotylalcohol with their olefinic double bond should also be suppressed."
[3] "In order to prove this assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with different Snanch/Pts ratios were prepared."
[4] "The aim of this work"
[5] "Results discussed previously firmly suggest that our alloy type Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts can be effectively used both in selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and LT CO oxidation provided the Sn4+Pt ensemble sites can be formed in situ on supported alloy type SnPt nanoclusters."
[6] "In these experiments it was interesting to compare the value of x, i.e. the number related to the coordinative unsaturation of tin-containing surface organometallic moieties."
[7] "The highest extent of coordinative unsaturation has been obtained when tin anchoring has been carried out in the presence of excess gas-phase hydrogen."
[8] "The introduction of tin leads to significant increase of both the rate and the SCO selectivity."
[9] "In the presence of small amount of oxygen the value of x is nearly constant and x<1."
[10] "Over Pt/SiO2 undesired decarbonylation reaction takes place, leading to the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO."
[11] "This increase was also observed when the catalyst was reused without its contact to air."
[12] "The lack of positive results in this reaction can be attributed to (i) the steric hindrance of alkyl groups [6] ,[7] , and (ii) the decreased reactivity of the keto carbonyl group compared to the aldehyde one."
[13] "Despite the modest results obtained in this reaction the slight increase of SCO selectivity strongly indicates the involvement of ionic forms of tin formed during the treatment with crotonaldehyde."
[14] "Due to this activation the oxidation of CO over Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts takes place at much lower temperature than over the parent Pt/SiO2."
[15] "At higher CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.81.2, while at low CO partial pressure catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratio around 0.40.5 had the highest activity."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These applications rely on the ability to selectively hydrogenate or oxidize functional groups like aldehydes and CO at low temperatures or with high efficiency. To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers use a variety of methodologies. These include theoretical calculations to predict reaction pathways, kinetic studies to understand reaction rates, and experimental techniques like gas chromatography for product analysis. Theoretical models often involve computational chemistry methods to simulate the interaction of molecules with the catalyst surface. Experiments may involve preparing different catalyst compositions, varying reaction conditions, and monitoring the formation of desired products. The selectivity and efficiency are typically evaluated by measuring the conversion of reactants to products and comparing the yield of specific products relative to the total reaction output. By systematically varying experimental parameters and analyzing the results, researchers can identify optimal conditions for achieving high selectivity and efficiency in the hydrogenation or oxidation processes.
