          The paper focuses on the detailed aspects of catalyst design incorporating tin tetraalkyls, highlighting the importance of hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes as a model reaction. It emphasizes the role of ionic species in modified platinum catalysts and introduces an alternative reaction mechanism involving the PtSnO2 interface for CO activation. To validate the hypothesis, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with varying Snanch/Pts ratios were synthesized. The results from tin anchoring experiments show that under favorable conditions, the Snanch/Pts ratio significantly exceeds monolayer coverage. The Pt/SiO2 catalysts exhibit undesired decarbonylation, resulting in the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO. The introduction of tin notably increases both the reaction rate and the selectivity of crotylalcohol (SCO). Similar trends were observed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, indicating that tin significantly enhances the reaction rate and leads to a pronounced increase in selectivity. The catalyst behavior is highly dependent on the CO partial pressure.

          论文详细探讨了基于四烷基锡的催化剂设计，强调了不饱和醛氢化作为模型反应的重要性。它强调了修改后铂催化剂中离子物种的作用，并提出了PtSnO2界面参与CO激活的替代反应机制。为了验证假设，制备了具有不同Snanch/Pts比率的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。从锡锚定实验中得到的结果表明，在有利的实验条件下，Snanch/Pts比率大大超过了单层覆盖率。Pt/SiO2催化剂表现出不希望的脱羰化反应，导致生成C3烃和吸附态CO。引入锡显著增加了反应速率和SCO选择性。在环已酮的液相氢化中观察到了类似的趋势，即锡显著提高了反应速率并导致选择性大幅增加。在cinnamaldehyde氢化反应中也观察到了相似的趋势，表明锡显著增强了反应速率并导致选择性显著提高。催化剂的行为高度依赖于CO分压。

          The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes is a critical model reaction, and it has been shown that modified platinum catalysts with tin, germanium, or iron additives have significantly higher selectivity for aldehyde hydrogenation compared to non-modified catalysts. The interaction depicted in Scheme 1 necessitates the formation of Snn+Pt cluster sites, which are ionic Snn+ species either anchored at the metal site or at the metal-support interface. In catalysts with SnO2 support, there is a synergistic effect between the oxide and metal phases. By using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4, Snanch/Pts ratios of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3 were achieved, respectively. To validate the assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with various Snanch/Pts ratios were synthesized. The tin anchoring reaction was monitored over 1.57 hours by determining the amount of C2H6, C2H4, or CH4 produced. Detailed information about the catalyst preparation and test outcomes will be summarized in this study. The maximum coordinative unsaturation was achieved when the tin anchoring occurred with excess gas-phase hydrogen. The experimental data in Table 3 show that under the following tin anchoring conditions, the Snanch/Pts ratio can be substantially increased: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4; (ii) extended reaction duration; (iii) increased reaction temperature; (iv) use of excess hydrogen; (v) oxygen addition during tin anchoring. The Pt/SiO2 catalyst undergoes undesired decarbonylation, yielding C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO. In this reaction, a similar pattern to the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CA is observed, where the introduction of tin markedly accelerates the reaction rate and results in a notable increase in selectivity. At higher CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.8 to 1.2 showed the highest activity, whereas at lower CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.4 to 0.5 exhibited the greatest activity.

          不饱和醛的氢化是重要的模型反应，已证明添加锡、锗或铁的改性铂催化剂在醛氢化方面的选择性明显高于未改性的催化剂。如图1所示的交互作用需要形成Snn+Pt簇集位点，即在金属位点或金属-支撑界面稳定化的离子Snn+物种。在SnO2支持的催化剂中，氧化物与金属相之间存在协同作用。通过使用Sn(CH3)4、Sn(C2H5)4和Sn(C4H9)4，分别获得了Snanch/Pts比率为0.6、0.4和0.3。为了验证假设，制备了具有不同Snanch/Pts比率的Sn-Pt/SiO2催化剂。锡锚定反应在1.57小时内被监测，通过确定生成的C2H6、C2H4或CH4的量来进行。本研究将总结这些催化剂的制备细节及其测试结果。最大配位不饱和度是在使用过量气体相氢气进行锡锚定时获得的。表3中的实验数据显示，在以下锡锚定条件下，Snanch/Pts比率可以显著增加：(i)Sn(C2H5)4的初始浓度较高；(ii)延长反应时间；(iii)提高反应温度；(iv)使用过量氢气；(v)在锡锚定时加入氧气。Pt/SiO2催化剂发生不希望的脱羰化反应，产生C3烃和吸附态CO。在这一反应中，观察到了类似于CA的液相氢化的相似模式，即添加锡显著提高了反应速率并导致了非常明显的选择性增加。在较高的CO分压下，Snanch/Pts比率为0.8至1.2的催化剂显示了最高的活性，而在较低的CO分压下，Snanch/Pts比率为0.4至0.5的催化剂表现出了最大的活性。
