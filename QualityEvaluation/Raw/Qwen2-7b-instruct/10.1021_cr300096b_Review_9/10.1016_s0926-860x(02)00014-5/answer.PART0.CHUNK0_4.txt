[1] "The paper is aimed to demonstrate how the activity and selectivity of a Pt/SiO2 catalyst can be tailored by introduction of tin either to hydrogenate the aldehyde group in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (UA) or oxidize carbon monoxide at room temperature."
[2] "It should also be emphasized that in the selective hydrogenation of UA, in addition to the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, the adsorption of both the substrate and the formed crotylalcohol with their olefinic double bond should also be suppressed."
[3] "Results obtained both in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen and excess hydrogen are summarized in Table 3 . As emerges from these results in excess hydrogen both the rate of tin anchoring and the values of x are much higher than in its absence (compare W0 and x values in Table 3 for experiments 16 and experiments 712)."
[4] "Consequently, these results strongly demonstrate the role of tin in the activation of carbon monoxide. Due to this activation the oxidation of CO over Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts takes place at much lower temperature than over the parent Pt/SiO2."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, specifically Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications including fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts allow for the selective hydrogenation of aldehyde and ketone groups, which is crucial for the production of alcohols, amides, and other valuable compounds. The optimization of this process involves studying and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the catalysts. Techniques include modifying the catalyst composition, improving reaction conditions, and utilizing advanced characterization methods to understand the active sites and mechanisms of the catalytic reactions. For instance, the paper discusses how the introduction of tin into a Pt/SiO2 catalyst system can tailor its activity and selectivity, enabling the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and the low-temperature oxidation of carbon monoxide. The experimental evidence indicates that the in situ formation of Sn4+Pt ensemble sites plays a key role in activating both carbonyl groups and the CO molecule, thus enhancing the catalytic performance of the system.

催化剂，特别是铂-镍复合体系，用于催化氢化C═O键，在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域具有重要应用。这些催化剂能够选择性地氢化醛基和酮基，对于醇、酰胺等有价值化合物的生产至关重要。优化这一过程包括研究和提高催化剂的选择性和效率的技术，如修改催化剂组成、改善反应条件以及利用高级表征方法理解活性位点和催化反应机制。文献提到通过在铂/SiO2催化剂系统中引入锡可以调整其活性和选择性，从而实现α,β不饱和醛的定向氢化和碳氧化合物低温氧化。实验结果表明，原位形成Sn4+Pt簇集位点在激活羰基团和CO分子方面起着关键作用，从而提高了系统的催化性能。
