Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially through the use of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, significantly contributes to various industrial and research applications such as the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. This process is studied and optimized across both theoretical and experimental domains using methodologies including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ultra-high vacuum (UHV) studies, and reactor evaluations. For instance, the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts serves as a model reaction to correlate the activity of CO bond hydrogenation with DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies, and catalytic performance in batch and flow reactors. 

Selective hydrogenation of CO bonds in unsaturated aldehydes, such as acrolein, is also a focus, aiming to produce specific products like alcohols. The presence of di-σ-CO configurations on PtFe/SiO2 surfaces is responsible for the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond leading to the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols. 

Bimetallic catalysts have been shown to outperform monometallic catalysts in the hydrogenation of molecules like maleic anhydride, yielding valuable products. For instance, supported PtNi catalysts catalyze the production of succinic acid from maleic anhydride with high efficiency. 

Similarly, in the hydrogenation of nitriles, such as butyronitrile, PtRh bimetallic catalysts prepared by a colloid method are found to be active, with Rh atoms concentrated at the surface of the bimetallic nanoparticles. Enhanced activity is observed on catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation of metals rather than coimpregnation.

In summary, the use of bimetallic catalysts for CO, CN, and NO hydrogenation processes enables the efficient and selective production of desired products in various industrial and research applications, leveraging a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to optimize catalyst design and performance.

催化氢化C═O键，尤其是通过使用如Pt-Ni体系这样的双金属催化剂，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业与研究应用产生了重要贡献。这一过程在理论和实验领域中得到了广泛的研究与优化，采用了包括密度泛函理论（DFT）计算、超真空（UHV）研究以及批式和流体反应器评估在内的方法。例如，通过PtNi双金属催化剂进行丙酮的氢化作为探针反应，用于关联CO键氢化活性与DFT结合能计算、UHV研究和支持催化剂的催化性能之间的联系。

对于不饱和醛中的CO键选择性氢化，例如对丙烯醛的研究，旨在生产特定产品，如醇类。PtFe/SiO2表面上的di-σ-CO配置被认为是选择性氢化CO键形成α,β-不饱和醇的原因。

双金属催化剂在马来酸酐的氢化中表现出优于单金属催化剂的效果，生成有价值的产品。例如，支持的PtNi催化剂能够高效地将马来酸酐转化为琥珀酸。

同样，在腈的氢化过程中，如丁腈，采用PtRh双金属催化剂制备的胶体方法显示出活性，Rh原子集中在双金属纳米颗粒的表面。通过顺序浸渍金属而非共浸渍的方法制备的催化剂表现出增强的活性。

综上所述，利用双金属催化剂进行CO、CN和NO氢化过程不仅能够高效且选择性地产生所需产品，而且通过结合理论与实验方法来优化催化剂设计和性能。
