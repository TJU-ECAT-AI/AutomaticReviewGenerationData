4.1.2 CO Hydrogenation
"Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."
"More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."
"In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation."
4.1.2.1 Example: Hydrogenation of Propanal
"The hydrogenation of propanal is used as a probe reaction to correlate the activity of CO bond hydrogenation over PtNi bimetallic surfaces and catalysts."
"DFT calculations predict that propanal is more weakly bound to the PtNiPt(111) subsurface structure than on either Ni or Pt, suggesting a possible low-temperature CO hydrogenation pathway based on trends observed for CC hydrogenation."
"UHV studies using TPD on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil verify that different bimetallic surface structures exhibit distinct CO hydrogenation activity."
"Batch and flow reactor studies show that the PtNi/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalyst exhibits a higher CO hydrogenation rate and a lower activation barrier than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
4.1.2.2 Selective Hydrogenation of CO in Unsaturated Aldehydes
"The selective hydrogenation of acrolein, the smallest α,β-unsaturated aldehyde, has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."
"Hydrogenation of the CO bond in crotonaldehyde over PtSn supported on SiO2 and α-Al2O3 demonstrated that the particle-size effect was not as important on bimetallic catalysts as it was on monometallic catalysts."
4.1.2.3 Hydrogenation of CO in Other Molecules
"The hydrogenation of maleic anhydride can produce many different products, but only some of the products are valuable in industry."
"Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
4.1.3 NO and CN Hydrogenation
"Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles is an important industrial process to manufacture the nylon monomer, hexamethylenediamine, from adiponitrile."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications. These include fine chemical synthesis, production of pharmaceutical precursors, and conversion of cellulosic biomass. Bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced activity and selectivity for CO hydrogenation. The process involves correlating theoretical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT) to predict binding energies, with experimental techniques like ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies and reactor evaluations. For instance, hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts serves as a model to demonstrate these correlations. Additionally, the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes like acrolein and CO in other molecules, such as maleic anhydride, showcases the versatility of these catalysts. The methodology includes utilizing DFT calculations, UHV studies, and reactor evaluations to optimize and enhance the efficiency of the process across different domains.

The hydrogenation of nitriles, particularly butyronitrile, is another key application. It is essential for the manufacturing of the nylon monomer, hexamethylenediamine. Bimetallic catalysts like PtRh systems can be active in hydrogenating the CN bond in butyronitrile, demonstrating the importance of bimetallic systems in industrial processes.

In summary, the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts, is pivotal for numerous industrial applications and research. The methodologies employed include theoretical predictions, experimental validations, and optimization strategies to ensure efficient and selective reactions.
