The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This methodology employs a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies, and batch and flow reactor evaluations, to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the process. For instance, the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts serves as a model to correlate the activity of CO bond hydrogenation with DFT predictions, UHV studies, and catalytic evaluation. Similarly, DFT calculations and reactor evaluations have been performed for the hydrogenation of acetaldehyde and acetone over supported Pt3d bimetallic catalysts. The selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, such as acrolein, has also been explored on various surfaces, highlighting the importance of catalyst design in achieving specific product outcomes. Additionally, the hydrogenation of other molecules, including maleic anhydride, showcases the versatility of bimetallic catalysts in producing valuable chemical intermediates and fine chemicals.
