4.1.2 CO Hydrogenation
"Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."
"The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."
"In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation."
"More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process enables the production of valuable fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors from α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. Recent studies have also highlighted the importance of CO bond hydrogenation as an initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass into biofuels and other value-added products. To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ methodologies ranging from theoretical calculations like density functional theory (DFT) to experimental techniques such as ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies and batch and flow reactor evaluations.
