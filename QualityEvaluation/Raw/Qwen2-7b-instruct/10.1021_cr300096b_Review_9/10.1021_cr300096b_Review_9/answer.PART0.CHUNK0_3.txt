"Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is an important industrial reaction for organic synthesis."
"The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes has been of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals and pharmaceutical precursors."
"In this section we will first use the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts as an example to demonstrate the correlation between DFT calculations of binding energies, UHV studies of low-temperature hydrogenation, and batch and flow reactor evaluation."
"Using similar approaches, DFT calculations and reactor evaluations were performed for CO bond hydrogenation of acetaldehyde (246) and acetone (246, 247) over supported Pt3d bimetallic catalysts."
"Selective hydrogenation of CO in unsaturated aldehydes has been investigated on several 3d/Pt(111) surfaces."
"The presence of the di-σ-CO configuration has also been proposed for the adsorption of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on PtFe/SiO2, responsible for the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond for the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols."
"PtCo/γ-Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts showed significantly higher hydrogenation rates for acetaldehyde and acetone than the monometallic Pt and Co catalysts."
"Defects on metal surfaces favor interactions with the CC moiety, which account for the undesired aldehyde products."
"Pt nanoparticles were more active for selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in cinnamaldehyde."
"Catalysts with Pt and Sn in close contact are more selective in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol as compared with catalysts with a lesser interaction."
"Supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts showed higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometals."
"The PtFe/SiO2 catalyst has been used for the partial hydrogenation of acetic acid."
"Amines are important compounds for manufacturing dyes, solvents, detergents, and drugs."
"Burch et al. found that PtRe/TiO2 supported catalysts, synthesized by impregnation, were able to selectively hydrogenate the CO bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to form N-methylpyrrolidine."
"Other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts have also shown increased hydrogenation activity such as Ti, Zr, Hf, and Zn (283) for CO and CC hydrogenation, Ag (326) for CC hydrogenation, and Mo (296) for CO hydrogenation."
"Catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles is an important industrial process to manufacture the nylon monomer, hexamethylenediamine, from adiponitrile."
"PtRh/AC catalysts synthesized by a colloid method were active for hydrogenation of the CN bond in butyronitrile."
"Catalysts with Cu and Pt also supported on NaY zeolite show increased reduction of the metal alloyed with Pt, but the activity is lower for acetonitrile hydrogenation."
"Synthesis of aromatic haloamines is important for the production of dyes, herbicides, and pesticides."
"PVP-stabilized PtRu colloids, prepared by a colloid-synthesis method, selectively hydrogenated the NO bond of o-chloronitrobenzene to form o-chloroaniline."
"PtCu/γ-Al2O3 catalysts can be used for the reduction of nitrates and nitrites into nitrogen for the treatment of drinking water."
"PtIn supported on γ-Al2O3 and SiO2, prepared by impregnation, were also active for the reduction of nitrates in drinking water."

Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications such as the synthesis of fine chemicals, pharmaceutical precursors, and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. This process is studied and optimized across theoretical and experimental domains through methodologies such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) studies, and batch and flow reactor evaluations. 

Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those featuring combinations like Pt-Ni, are employed to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of CO hydrogenation. For instance, the hydrogenation of propanal over PtNi bimetallic catalysts serves as a model system to correlate DFT predictions, UHV findings, and reactor evaluations. Additionally, the use of bimetallic surfaces and catalysts allows for the selective hydrogenation of CO bonds in unsaturated aldehydes. 

Selective hydrogenation of CO bonds is also explored on specific surfaces, like 3d/Pt(111) surfaces, and with elements like PtFe/SiO2, which facilitates the selective hydrogenation of CO bonds for the formation of α,β-unsaturated alcohols. Bimetallic catalysts like PtCo/γ-Al2O3 show higher rates of hydrogenation for compounds such as acetaldehyde and acetone compared to their monometallic counterparts. 

In the case of amine synthesis, PtRe/TiO2 supported catalysts are capable of selectively hydrogenating the CO bond in N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one. Other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts, including Ti, Zr, Hf, Zn, Ag, and Mo, also demonstrate increased activity in CO and CC hydrogenation processes. 

For the hydrogenation of nitriles, PtRh/AC catalysts effectively catalyze the hydrogenation of the CN bond in butyronitrile. The addition of metals like Cu and Pt on NaY zeolite catalysts can promote the reduction of Ni2+ and increase the hydrogenation rate of butyronitrile. Moreover, catalysts like PtCu/γ-Al2O3 are utilized for the reduction of nitrates and nitrites into nitrogen for water treatment, while PtIn supported on γ-Al2O3 and SiO2 is active for the reduction of nitrates in drinking water.

催化CO键氢化在精细化学品合成、制药前体生产以及木质素生物质转化等方面发挥着重要作用。这一过程在理论和实验领域通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算、超高真空（UHV）研究和批式及流动反应器评估等方法进行研究和优化。

双金属催化剂，尤其是Pt-Ni组合，被用于增强CO氢化的选择性和效率。例如，使用PtNi双金属催化剂对丙酮醛的氢化作为模型系统，来关联DFT预测、UHV发现和支持催化剂的评价。此外，使用双金属表面和催化剂允许对不饱和醛中的CO键进行选择性氢化。

对于CO键的选择性氢化，在特定表面上进行了探索，例如3d/Pt(111)表面，并使用元素如PtFe/SiO2，这促进了CO键的选择性氢化，形成α,β-不饱和醇。双金属催化剂如PtCo/γ-Al2O3显示了比其单金属催化剂更高的乙醛和乙酸酯的氢化速率。

在胺合成中，PtRe/TiO2支持催化剂能够选择性地氢化N-甲基吡咯啶-2-酮中的CO键。其他Pt基双金属催化剂，包括Ti、Zr、Hf、Zn、Ag和Mo，也表现出增加的CO和CC氢化活性。

对于腈的氢化，PtRh/AC催化剂有效地催化了丁腈的CN键氢化。向NaY沸石催化剂中添加Cu和Pt金属可以促进Ni2+的还原并增加丁腈的氢化速率。此外，PtCu/γ-Al2O3催化剂用于硝酸盐和亚硝酸盐的还原以处理饮用水。PtIn支持在γ-Al2O3和SiO2上的催化剂也是水处理中硝酸盐还原的活性物质。
