The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . As the derivatives of biomass often contain the CO functional groups, facile catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is crucial to the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels or chemicals [5] ,[6] . For example, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass [4] .

Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [7] ,[8] ,[9] . Many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to determine the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] . It has been demonstrated that bimetallic structures strongly affect their catalytic performance. For example, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface, with a monolayer of Ni atoms located on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, is more active for dehydrogenation [16] and oxygenate reforming than either of the parent metals [17] . In contrast, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, with Ni atoms residing underneath the Pt(1 1 1) surface, shows a novel low temperature hydrogenation pathway that is absent on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1) [14] . These surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than either of the monometallic catalysts [18] ,[19] .

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process facilitates the conversion of biomass derivatives into fuels or chemicals, particularly by breaking the CO functional groups within biomass. Bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-Ni systems, are utilized due to their unique properties that differ from monometallic catalysts. Surface science studies demonstrate that bimetallic structures significantly impact catalytic performance. For instance, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface shows enhanced dehydrogenation and oxygenate reforming activities compared to individual metals. Additionally, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure enables a novel low temperature hydrogenation pathway absent in pure Pt or Ni catalysts. These findings have been extended to γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic counterparts.

1. C═O键的催化氢化在生物质和生物质衍生氧杂烷烃的生产中引起了极大的关注，这些物质具有可再生、潜在可持续性和环境友好性等优点。由于生物质往往含有CO功能团，因此通过催化剂将生物质衍生物转化为燃料或化学品的关键步骤是催化氢化CO键。例如，考虑细胞质生物质的催化转化时，CO键氢化被认为是初始步骤之一。双金属催化剂在多种反应如氢化、脱氢和重整中被广泛使用，其独特的性质与对应的单金属催化剂显著不同。进行了许多实验和理论研究以确定在定义明确的单晶表面的双金属系统的活性和稳定性。研究表明，双金属结构强烈影响其催化性能。例如，NiPtPt(1 1 1)双金属表面，Ni层位于Pt(1 1 1)表面上的一层，对于脱氢作用更活跃，相比各自的母金属表现出更高的活性。相反，PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构，Ni原子位于Pt(1 1 1)表面之下，显示出一种在纯Pt或Ni催化剂上不存在的低温氢化途径。这些表面科学结果扩展到了γ-Al2O3支持的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂，其中终止于Pt的双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于各自单金属催化剂。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. It enables the conversion of biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons into valuable fuels and chemicals, which are renewable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This process is crucial in the initial steps of catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. Bimetallic catalysts, which have unique properties distinct from their monometallic counterparts, play a vital role in numerous reactions including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming. The formation of bimetallic bonds in these catalysts results in enhanced hydrogenation activity compared to the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The interaction between bimetallic catalysts and oxide supports affects the catalytic performance, and the lower activity and fewer chemisorption sites on TiO2-supported catalysts are likely due to the stronger interaction between TiO2 and metal particles.

However, the γ-Al2O3 support particles can agglomerate or dissolve due to their relatively poor hydrothermal stability at relatively high temperatures in aqueous phase, which are the reaction conditions typically used for biomass conversion. One approach for improving the hydrothermal stability is to use alumina in the form of zeolites and membrane [20] ,[21] ,[22] . Another approach is to use oxide supports with greater hydrothermal stability than γ-Al2O3. It is well known that supported catalysts often exhibit different catalytic performance depending on the nature of the support materials. In the current study acetone hydrogenation was used as the probe reaction to investigate the support effect on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2. The comparative studies showed that the oxide supports strongly affected the hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalysts, following the activity trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. The supported catalysts were characterized using TEM and EXAFS in order to understand the origins responsible for the difference in hydrogenation activity.

How does the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contribute to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, and what methodologies are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains?

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially through the utilization of bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications, including the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. This process is pivotal for the production of fuels and chemicals from renewable biomass sources, which are recognized for their environmental benefits.

2. Bimetallic catalysts offer unique properties that distinguish them from their monometallic counterparts, making them valuable in a wide range of reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to ascertain the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on defined crystal surfaces. These studies have revealed that the structure of bimetallic catalysts significantly influences their catalytic performance.

3. For instance, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface demonstrates enhanced dehydrogenation and oxygenate reforming activities compared to its constituent metals. Conversely, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure exhibits a distinctive low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not observed in pure Pt or Ni. These findings have been extended to γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic equivalents.

4. However, the hydrothermal stability of γ-Al2O3, a common support material, is limited, leading to agglomeration or dissolution under aqueous phase conditions typically encountered in biomass conversion processes. To overcome this challenge, researchers explore alternative support materials, such as zeolites and membranes, or opt for oxide supports with superior hydrothermal stability. The current study employs acetone hydrogenation as a probing reaction to evaluate the impact of various support materials—γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2—on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.

5. The methodology involves a comparative analysis of the hydrogenation activity of the supported catalysts, alongside the characterization of their properties using techniques like TEM and EXAFS. These approaches enable a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to the differences in hydrogenation activity among the catalysts. By elucidating the support effect on bimetallic catalysts, researchers can optimize and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process, thereby advancing the fields of fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

1. 通过使用如Pt-Ni体系这样的双金属催化剂，催化氢化C═O键在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究领域中起着至关重要的作用。这个过程对于从可再生生物质来源生产燃料和化学品至关重要，这些来源因其环境优势而受到认可。

2. 双金属催化剂在特性上与单一金属催化剂有显著差异，使其在包括氢化、脱氢和重整在内的多种反应中具有独特的价值。许多实验和理论研究已经对在定义的晶面表面的双金属系统进行了活动性和稳定性的评估。这些研究表明，双金属催化剂的结构对其催化性能有着显著影响。

3. 比如，NiPtPt(1 1 1)双金属表面在脱氢和氧化物重整方面表现出比其组成金属更高的活性。相反，PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构展示了在纯Pt或Ni中未见的低温氢化新途径。这些发现已经扩展到γ-Al2O3支持的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂，其中Pt终止的双金属催化剂比其单金属等效物表现出更高的氢化活性。

4. 然而，在水相条件下通常用于生物质转化过程的γ-Al2O3的热稳定性有限，导致其聚集或溶解。为了解决这一挑战，研究人员探索了诸如沸石和膜之类的替代支撑材料，或者选择具有更优越热稳定性氧化铝的支撑材料。当前的研究将丙酮氢化作为探针反应，以评估γ-Al2O3、SiO2和TiO2等不同支撑材料对Pt/Ni双金属催化剂催化活性的影响。

5. 这一方法包括对比分析支持催化剂的氢化活性，并结合使用TEM和EXAFS等技术对它们的性质进行表征。这些方法使得能够深入了解导致催化剂活性差异的潜在机制。通过阐明支持材料对双金属催化剂的影响，研究人员可以优化和提高催化过程的选择性和效率，从而推进精细化学品合成和生物质转化领域的进展。

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially through the use of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes are crucial because they facilitate the conversion of renewable biomass resources into valuable chemicals and fuels. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process span both theoretical and experimental domains. This includes using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict reaction pathways, pulse chemisorption to determine metal dispersion, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to monitor reaction kinetics, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize catalyst morphology.

2. The selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process are influenced by the nature of the support material. For instance, the study found that the activity trend for hydrogenation follows the sequence of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2 after normalizing by the number of chemisorption sites. This is consistent with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts. The lower activity on TiO2-supported catalysts could be attributed to a stronger interaction between TiO2 and the supported metal particles, which may reduce the number of active sites and hinder the effective hydrogenation of acetone.

3. The formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds in the catalysts leads to higher hydrogenation activity than that of the corresponding monometallic catalysts. This is supported by previous surface science and theoretical predictions. The study provides evidence that the extent of PtNi bond formation correlates with the enhanced hydrogenation activity, as indicated by the coordination numbers obtained from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis.

4. The interaction between bimetallic catalysts and oxide supports plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding how this interaction varies across different types of oxide supports, such as TiO2 with lower surface areas and other early transition metal oxides like ZrO2. Such knowledge is essential for identifying bimetallic catalysts with desirable activity and hydrothermal stability.

1. 从生物质和生物质衍生的氧化烃中生产燃料和化学品吸引了极大的关注，因为它们具有可再生、潜在可持续性和环境友好等优点。例如，通过使用如Pt-Ni系统的双金属催化剂，可以实现细化学品合成和细胞质生物质转换。这些过程对于将可再生生物质资源转化为有价值的化学品和燃料至关重要。研究、优化和提高选择性和效率的方法涵盖了理论和实验领域，包括使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算预测反应途径、脉冲化学吸附确定金属分散度、傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱监测反应动力学以及透射电子显微镜（TEM）表征催化剂形态。

2. 选择性和效率受到支持材料性质的影响。例如，研究发现氢化活性趋势遵循SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2的序列，这在通过气体吸附点数归一化后。这与三种催化剂中的PtNi双金属键的配位数一致。TiO2支持的催化剂活性较低可能是由于TiO2与支持金属粒子之间的较强相互作用导致的，这可能减少了活性位点并阻碍了乙酮的有效氢化。

3. 双金属催化剂中的PtNi双金属键的形成导致了比相应单金属催化剂更高的氢化活性。这是由之前的表面科学和理论预测所支持的。研究提供了证据表明PtNi键形成的程度与增强的氢化活性相关，这从扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析获得的配位数中得到体现。

4. bimetallic催化剂与氧化物支持之间的相互作用对催化性能起着关键作用。这项研究强调了理解不同类型的氧化物支持之间差异的重要性，如具有较低表面积的TiO2和其他早期过渡金属氧化物（如ZrO2）。这种知识对于识别具有理想活性和水热稳定性的双金属催化剂至关重要。

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion because these catalysts can facilitate the efficient conversion of oxygenated hydrocarbons into valuable chemical products. They offer unique properties compared to monometallic catalysts, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The methodologies employed involve studying, optimizing, and enhancing the catalytic performance through both theoretical and experimental approaches, including pulse CO chemisorption, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis.
   
2. The methodologies used to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process include employing theoretical predictions like density functional theory (DFT) calculations, experimental techniques such as pulse CO chemisorption, FTIR spectroscopy, TEM analysis, and EXAFS characterization, as well as reactor evaluations using batch reactors to measure the rates of acetone consumption and 2-propanol production. These methods help in understanding the origins of the differences in hydrogenation activity among the supported catalysts and in identifying the optimal conditions for the process.
   
3. The selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process are influenced by factors such as the nature of the support material. In this study, the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 was compared. The results showed that the activity trend followed the order of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, which can be correlated with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts. This indicates that the interaction between the bimetallic catalysts and oxide supports plays a significant role in determining the catalytic performance.
   
4. The catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts is higher than that of Pt or Ni monometallic catalysts. This supports the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds would result in higher hydrogenation activity than that of the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The enhanced activity is attributed to the unique properties of bimetallic structures, which can lead to more efficient adsorption and activation of reactants.
   
5. The lower hydrogenation activity and the smaller number of chemisorption sites on TiO2-supported catalysts are likely related to the stronger interaction between TiO2 and supported metal particles. This interaction could reduce the number of active sites and hinder the effective hydrogenation of acetone, which may require more detailed experimental and theoretical studies to fully understand.

4. Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的活性高于Pt或Ni单金属催化剂。这支持了表面科学和理论预测的观点，即形成PtNi双金属键会比相应的单金属催化剂产生更高的氢化活性。增强的活性归因于双金属结构的独特性质，这可以更有效地吸附和活化反应物。

5. TiO2支持的催化剂活性较低且化学吸附点较少可能与TiO2和支持金属颗粒之间的更强相互作用有关。这种相互作用可能会减少活性位点并阻碍乙酮的有效氢化，这可能需要更详细的实验和理论研究来完全理解。
