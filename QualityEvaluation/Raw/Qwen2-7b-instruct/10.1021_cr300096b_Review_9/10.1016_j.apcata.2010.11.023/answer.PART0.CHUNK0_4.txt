[1] "The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[3] "The current study acetone hydrogenation was used as the probe reaction to investigate the support effect on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2."
[4] "The comparative studies showed that the oxide supports strongly affected the hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalysts, following the activity trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2."
[5] "The trend is consistent with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion because these catalysts can facilitate the efficient conversion of oxygenated hydrocarbons into valuable chemical products. They offer unique properties compared to monometallic catalysts, enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The methodologies employed involve studying, optimizing, and enhancing the catalytic performance through both theoretical and experimental approaches, including pulse CO chemisorption, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis.
   
2. The methodologies used to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process include employing theoretical predictions like density functional theory (DFT) calculations, experimental techniques such as pulse CO chemisorption, FTIR spectroscopy, TEM analysis, and EXAFS characterization, as well as reactor evaluations using batch reactors to measure the rates of acetone consumption and 2-propanol production. These methods help in understanding the origins of the differences in hydrogenation activity among the supported catalysts and in identifying the optimal conditions for the process.
   
3. The selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process are influenced by factors such as the nature of the support material. In this study, the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2 was compared. The results showed that the activity trend followed the order of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2, which can be correlated with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts. This indicates that the interaction between the bimetallic catalysts and oxide supports plays a significant role in determining the catalytic performance.
   
4. The catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts is higher than that of Pt or Ni monometallic catalysts. This supports the argument from previous surface science and theoretical predictions that the formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds would result in higher hydrogenation activity than that of the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The enhanced activity is attributed to the unique properties of bimetallic structures, which can lead to more efficient adsorption and activation of reactants.
   
5. The lower hydrogenation activity and the smaller number of chemisorption sites on TiO2-supported catalysts are likely related to the stronger interaction between TiO2 and supported metal particles. This interaction could reduce the number of active sites and hinder the effective hydrogenation of acetone, which may require more detailed experimental and theoretical studies to fully understand.

1. 烃类氧化物中C═O键的催化氢化，尤其是使用如铂-镍双金属催化剂系统，对生物基和生物衍生的烃类合成以及生物质转化具有重大影响。这些催化剂能够促进氧气化合物转化为有价值的化学品，其独特的性质与单金属催化剂相比有所不同，能提高选择性和效率。研究、优化和提升这一过程的方法涉及理论和实验两方面，包括脉冲CO吸附、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）分析和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）表征，以及在批次反应器中测量乙酮消耗速率和2-丙醇生成速率，以了解支持催化剂之间差异的原因，并确定过程的最佳条件。

2. 在研究、优化和提升选择性和效率的过程中，采用的手段包括利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算进行理论预测，通过脉冲CO吸附、FTIR光谱、TEM分析和EXAFS表征等实验技术，以及在批次反应器中评价乙酮消耗速率和2-丙醇生成速率，这些方法有助于理解三种支持催化剂中双金属键协同作用的不同来源，并确定过程的最佳条件。

3. 支持材料的性质对催化氢化过程的选择性和效率有显著影响。本研究比较了γ-Al2O3、SiO2和TiO2上负载的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的活性。结果显示，活性趋势为SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2，这与三种催化剂中的PtNi双金属键的配位数相吻合。这表明双金属催化剂与氧化物支持之间的相互作用在确定催化性能中起着重要作用。

4. Pt/Ni双金属催化剂的活性高于Pt或Ni单金属催化剂。这支持了表面科学和理论预测的观点，即形成PtNi双金属键会比相应的单金属催化剂产生更高的氢化活性。增强的活性归因于双金属结构的独特性质，这可以更有效地吸附和活化反应物。

5. TiO2支持的催化剂活性较低且化学吸附点较少可能与TiO2和支持金属颗粒之间的更强相互作用有关。这种相互作用可能会减少活性位点并阻碍乙酮的有效氢化，这可能需要更详细的实验和理论研究来完全理解。
