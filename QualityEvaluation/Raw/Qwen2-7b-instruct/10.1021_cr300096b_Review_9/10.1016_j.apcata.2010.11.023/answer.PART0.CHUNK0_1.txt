The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. It enables the conversion of biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons into valuable fuels and chemicals, which are renewable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly. This process is crucial in the initial steps of catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. Bimetallic catalysts, which have unique properties distinct from their monometallic counterparts, play a vital role in numerous reactions including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming. The formation of bimetallic bonds in these catalysts results in enhanced hydrogenation activity compared to the corresponding monometallic catalysts. The interaction between bimetallic catalysts and oxide supports affects the catalytic performance, and the lower activity and fewer chemisorption sites on TiO2-supported catalysts are likely due to the stronger interaction between TiO2 and metal particles.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用如Pt-Ni这样的双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用（如精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化）具有重大意义。它使生物质和生物质衍生的氧化烃能够转化为有价值的燃料和化学品，这些燃料和化学品是可再生、可持续且环境友好的。这个过程在木质纤维素生物质的催化转化中被视为重要的初始步骤。双金属催化剂具有与相应单金属催化剂显著不同的独特性质，在氢化、脱氢和重整等多种反应中被广泛利用。双金属键的形成使得双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于相应的单金属催化剂。双金属催化剂与氧化物支持材料之间的相互作用影响其催化性能，TiO2支持的催化剂活动较低和化学吸附位点较少可能归因于TiO2与金属颗粒之间更强的相互作用。
