The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . As the derivatives of biomass often contain the CO functional groups, facile catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is crucial to the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels or chemicals [5] ,[6] . For example, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass [4] . Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [7] ,[8] ,[9] . Many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to determine the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] . It has been demonstrated that bimetallic structures strongly affect their catalytic performance. For example, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface, with a monolayer of Ni atoms located on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, is more active for dehydrogenation [16] and oxygenate reforming than either of the parent metals [17] . In contrast, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, with Ni atoms residing underneath the Pt(1 1 1) surface, shows a novel low temperature hydrogenation pathway that is absent on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1) [14] . These surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than either of the monometallic catalysts [18] ,[19] . However, the γ-Al2O3 support particles can agglomerate or dissolve due to their relatively poor hydrothermal stability at relatively high temperatures in aqueous phase, which are the reaction conditions typically used for biomass conversion. One approach for improving the hydrothermal stability is to use alumina in the form of zeolites and membrane [20] ,[21] ,[22] . Another approach is to use oxide supports with greater hydrothermal stability than γ-Al2O3. It is well known that supported catalysts often exhibit different catalytic performance depending on the nature of the support materials. In the current study acetone hydrogenation was used as the probe reaction to investigate the support effect on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2. The comparative studies showed that the oxide supports strongly affected the hydrogenation activity of the bimetallic catalysts, following the activity trend of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2. The supported catalysts were characterized using TEM and EXAFS in order to understand the origins responsible for the difference in hydrogenation activity.

How does the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contribute to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, and what methodologies are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains?

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially through the utilization of bimetallic catalysts such as Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications, including the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. This process is pivotal for the production of fuels and chemicals from renewable biomass sources, which are recognized for their environmental benefits.

2. Bimetallic catalysts offer unique properties that distinguish them from their monometallic counterparts, making them valuable in a wide range of reactions, including hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and reforming. Numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted to ascertain the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on defined crystal surfaces. These studies have revealed that the structure of bimetallic catalysts significantly influences their catalytic performance.

3. For instance, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface demonstrates enhanced dehydrogenation and oxygenate reforming activities compared to its constituent metals. Conversely, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure exhibits a distinctive low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not observed in pure Pt or Ni. These findings have been extended to γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic equivalents.

4. However, the hydrothermal stability of γ-Al2O3, a common support material, is limited, leading to agglomeration or dissolution under aqueous phase conditions typically encountered in biomass conversion processes. To overcome this challenge, researchers explore alternative support materials, such as zeolites and membranes, or opt for oxide supports with superior hydrothermal stability. The current study employs acetone hydrogenation as a probing reaction to evaluate the impact of various support materials—γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and TiO2—on the catalytic activity of Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts.

5. The methodology involves a comparative analysis of the hydrogenation activity of the supported catalysts, alongside the characterization of their properties using techniques like TEM and EXAFS. These approaches enable a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms contributing to the differences in hydrogenation activity among the catalysts. By elucidating the support effect on bimetallic catalysts, researchers can optimize and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic process, thereby advancing the fields of fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

3. 比如，NiPtPt(1 1 1)双金属表面在脱氢和氧化物重整方面表现出比其组成金属更高的活性。相反，PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构展示了在纯Pt或Ni中未见的低温氢化新途径。这些发现已经扩展到γ-Al2O3支持的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂，其中Pt终止的双金属催化剂比其单金属等效物表现出更高的氢化活性。

4. 然而，在水相条件下通常用于生物质转化过程的γ-Al2O3的热稳定性有限，导致其聚集或溶解。为了解决这一挑战，研究人员探索了诸如沸石和膜之类的替代支撑材料，或者选择具有更优越热稳定性氧化铝的支撑材料。当前的研究将丙酮氢化作为探针反应，以评估γ-Al2O3、SiO2和TiO2等不同支撑材料对Pt/Ni双金属催化剂催化活性的影响。

5. 这一方法包括对比分析支持催化剂的氢化活性，并结合使用TEM和EXAFS等技术对它们的性质进行表征。这些方法使得能够深入了解导致催化剂活性差异的潜在机制。通过阐明支持材料对双金属催化剂的影响，研究人员可以优化和提高催化过程的选择性和效率，从而推进精细化学品合成和生物质转化领域的进展。
