The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] . As the derivatives of biomass often contain the CO functional groups, facile catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond is crucial to the conversion of biomass derivatives to fuels or chemicals [5] ,[6] . For example, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass [4] .

Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [7] ,[8] ,[9] . Many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to determine the activity and stability of bimetallic systems on well-defined single crystal surfaces [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] . It has been demonstrated that bimetallic structures strongly affect their catalytic performance. For example, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface, with a monolayer of Ni atoms located on the Pt(1 1 1) surface, is more active for dehydrogenation [16] and oxygenate reforming than either of the parent metals [17] . In contrast, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure, with Ni atoms residing underneath the Pt(1 1 1) surface, shows a novel low temperature hydrogenation pathway that is absent on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1) [14] . These surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activity than either of the monometallic catalysts [18] ,[19] .

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process facilitates the conversion of biomass derivatives into fuels or chemicals, particularly by breaking the CO functional groups within biomass. Bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-Ni systems, are utilized due to their unique properties that differ from monometallic catalysts. Surface science studies demonstrate that bimetallic structures significantly impact catalytic performance. For instance, the NiPtPt(1 1 1) bimetallic surface shows enhanced dehydrogenation and oxygenate reforming activities compared to individual metals. Additionally, the PtNiPt(1 1 1) subsurface structure enables a novel low temperature hydrogenation pathway absent in pure Pt or Ni catalysts. These findings have been extended to γ-Al2O3-supported Pt/Ni bimetallic catalysts, where Pt-terminated bimetallic catalysts exhibit higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic counterparts.

1. C═O键的催化氢化在生物质和生物质衍生氧杂烷烃的生产中引起了极大的关注，这些物质具有可再生、潜在可持续性和环境友好性等优点。由于生物质往往含有CO功能团，因此通过催化剂将生物质衍生物转化为燃料或化学品的关键步骤是催化氢化CO键。例如，考虑细胞质生物质的催化转化时，CO键氢化被认为是初始步骤之一。双金属催化剂在多种反应如氢化、脱氢和重整中被广泛使用，其独特的性质与对应的单金属催化剂显著不同。进行了许多实验和理论研究以确定在定义明确的单晶表面的双金属系统的活性和稳定性。研究表明，双金属结构强烈影响其催化性能。例如，NiPtPt(1 1 1)双金属表面，Ni层位于Pt(1 1 1)表面上的一层，对于脱氢作用更活跃，相比各自的母金属表现出更高的活性。相反，PtNiPt(1 1 1)亚表面结构，Ni原子位于Pt(1 1 1)表面之下，显示出一种在纯Pt或Ni催化剂上不存在的低温氢化途径。这些表面科学结果扩展到了γ-Al2O3支持的Pt/Ni双金属催化剂，其中终止于Pt的双金属催化剂的氢化活性高于各自单金属催化剂。
