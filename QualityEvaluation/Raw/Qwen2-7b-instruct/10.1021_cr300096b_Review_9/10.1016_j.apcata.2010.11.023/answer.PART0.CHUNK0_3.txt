[1] "The production of fuel and chemicals from biomass and biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons has attracted a great deal of attention due to their merits such as renewable, potentially sustainable and environmentally benign."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts have been utilized in many reactions such as hydrogenation, dehydrogenation and reforming due to their unique properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[3] "It has been demonstrated that bimetallic structures strongly affect their catalytic performance."
[4] "The lower hydrogenation activity and the smaller number of chemisorption sites on TiO2 supported catalyst are also likely related to the stronger interaction between TiO2 and supported metal particles."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially through the use of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes are crucial because they facilitate the conversion of renewable biomass resources into valuable chemicals and fuels. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process span both theoretical and experimental domains. This includes using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict reaction pathways, pulse chemisorption to determine metal dispersion, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to monitor reaction kinetics, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize catalyst morphology.

2. The selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process are influenced by the nature of the support material. For instance, the study found that the activity trend for hydrogenation follows the sequence of SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2 after normalizing by the number of chemisorption sites. This is consistent with the coordination numbers of the PtNi bimetallic bonds in the three catalysts. The lower activity on TiO2-supported catalysts could be attributed to a stronger interaction between TiO2 and the supported metal particles, which may reduce the number of active sites and hinder the effective hydrogenation of acetone.

3. The formation of PtNi bimetallic bonds in the catalysts leads to higher hydrogenation activity than that of the corresponding monometallic catalysts. This is supported by previous surface science and theoretical predictions. The study provides evidence that the extent of PtNi bond formation correlates with the enhanced hydrogenation activity, as indicated by the coordination numbers obtained from extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis.

4. The interaction between bimetallic catalysts and oxide supports plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance. This study emphasizes the importance of understanding how this interaction varies across different types of oxide supports, such as TiO2 with lower surface areas and other early transition metal oxides like ZrO2. Such knowledge is essential for identifying bimetallic catalysts with desirable activity and hydrothermal stability.

1. 从生物质和生物质衍生的氧化烃中生产燃料和化学品吸引了极大的关注，因为它们具有可再生、潜在可持续性和环境友好等优点。例如，通过使用如Pt-Ni系统的双金属催化剂，可以实现细化学品合成和细胞质生物质转换。这些过程对于将可再生生物质资源转化为有价值的化学品和燃料至关重要。研究、优化和提高选择性和效率的方法涵盖了理论和实验领域，包括使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算预测反应途径、脉冲化学吸附确定金属分散度、傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱监测反应动力学以及透射电子显微镜（TEM）表征催化剂形态。

2. 选择性和效率受到支持材料性质的影响。例如，研究发现氢化活性趋势遵循SiO2 > γ-Al2O3 > TiO2的序列，这在通过气体吸附点数归一化后。这与三种催化剂中的PtNi双金属键的配位数一致。TiO2支持的催化剂活性较低可能是由于TiO2与支持金属粒子之间的较强相互作用导致的，这可能减少了活性位点并阻碍了乙酮的有效氢化。

3. 双金属催化剂中的PtNi双金属键的形成导致了比相应单金属催化剂更高的氢化活性。这是由之前的表面科学和理论预测所支持的。研究提供了证据表明PtNi键形成的程度与增强的氢化活性相关，这从扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）分析获得的配位数中得到体现。

4. bimetallic催化剂与氧化物支持之间的相互作用对催化性能起着关键作用。这项研究强调了理解不同类型的氧化物支持之间差异的重要性，如具有较低表面积的TiO2和其他早期过渡金属氧化物（如ZrO2）。这种知识对于识别具有理想活性和水热稳定性的双金属催化剂至关重要。
