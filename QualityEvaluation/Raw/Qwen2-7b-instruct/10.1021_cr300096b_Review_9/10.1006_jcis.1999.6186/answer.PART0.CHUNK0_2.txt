[1] "Metal colloids in the range of 110 nm are very important in academia and industry, especially in the field of catalysis."
[2] "Compared with single-metal colloids, bimetallic colloids are of special interest for three reasons. First, they may serve as models for studying the formation of different alloys. Second, it is possible to save precious metal, such as Pt, by optimizing the synthetic conditions. Third, they may have great potential to be tailored with respect to the activity, selectivity, and stability for their numerous possible combinations."
[3] "Among many metallic catalysts, palladium catalyst is the most active but it causes more dehalogenation."
[4] "Platinum is very effective in minimizing dehalogenation combined with a higher activity; however, it gives a lower purity because of formation of byproducts."
[5] "Although the selectivity of o-CAN over ruthenium colloids is very high (.99.9%), the activity is low, and the reaction could not be accomplished under hydrogen at atmospheric pressure."
[6] "In the presence of the cobalt ion, nearly 100% selectivity to o-chloroaniline (o-CAN) could be achieved over PVPRu/Pt colloids, and the activity was two orders of magnitude higher than that of the PVPRu colloid."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes allow for the efficient production of valuable chemical intermediates and fuels. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains include computational simulations, kinetic studies, and detailed characterization of catalysts using techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

2. Bimetallic colloids offer unique advantages over single-metal colloids due to their potential to serve as models for studying alloy formation, the possibility of saving precious metals through optimized synthesis, and the ability to tailor activity, selectivity, and stability for diverse applications. The synthesis typically involves reducing mixed-metal salts with a reducing agent like sodium borohydride in a solvent system.

3. Palladium is known for its high activity in catalysis, but it tends to cause more dehalogenation, which can lead to the formation of unwanted byproducts. On the other hand, platinum effectively minimizes dehalogenation while maintaining a higher activity, though it may result in lower purity due to the formation of additional byproducts.

4. Ruthenium colloids exhibit high selectivity for hydrogenation reactions, particularly for halonitroaromatics, achieving selectivities close to 100%. However, the activity is generally low, and the reaction might not proceed efficiently under atmospheric pressure conditions.

5. Cobalt ions can significantly enhance the catalytic properties of bimetallic ruthenium-platinum colloids. Specifically, they enable nearly 100% selectivity towards the desired product, o-chloroaniline (o-CAN), with an activity that is two orders of magnitude higher compared to the activity of the monometallic ruthenium colloids.

1. 金属氢化反应，特别是铂-镍体系双金属催化剂，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物转化等工业和研究应用具有重要意义。这些过程能够高效生产有价值的化学中间体和燃料。研究、优化和提高这种过程的选择性和效率的方法包括计算模拟、动力学研究以及使用技术如X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和X射线衍射（XRD）对催化剂进行详细表征。

2. 双金属胶体相较于单一金属胶体有独特优势，它们可以作为合金形成的研究模型，通过优化合成条件节约贵重金属，并且可以根据多种组合进行定制以调整活性、选择性和稳定性。合成通常涉及在溶剂系统中使用还原剂如钠硼氢化物来还原混合金属盐。

3. 钯因其高活性而在催化中被广泛使用，但它倾向于引起更多的去卤化，可能导致产生副产品。相比之下，铂有效地减少了去卤化作用，同时保持较高的活性，尽管这可能由于产生额外副产品的结果导致较低的纯度。

4. 钌胶体在氢化反应中显示出极高的选择性，特别是对于卤代硝基芳烃，其选择性接近100%。然而，活性通常较低，反应可能无法在大气压力条件下进行。

5. 锰离子可以显著增强双金属钌铂胶体的催化性能。具体来说，它们使目标产物o-氯苯胺（o-CAN）的选择性达到几乎100%，与单金属钌胶体相比，其活性高出两个数量级。
