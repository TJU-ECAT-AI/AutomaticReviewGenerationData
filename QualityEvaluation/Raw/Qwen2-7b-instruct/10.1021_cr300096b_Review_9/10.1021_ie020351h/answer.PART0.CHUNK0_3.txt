[1] "Among the supported bimetallics that are best investigated and most like monophasic alloys are the ones that are relatively large (about 2030 Å or more in diameter) and contain two platinum-group metals (e.g., Ir and Pt). These have properties not greatly different from those of the bulk metals."
[2] "However, when the preparation conditions are sufficiently mild and the two metals are strongly enough bonded to each other, the oxophilic metalnoble metal bonds may remain largely intact in the activated catalyst."
[3] "The metals in almost all bimetallics reported in the preceding paragraphs of this section were evidently zerovalent."
[4] "For example, in auto exhaust catalysts, the supported Rh may be partly cationic and partly zerovalent while the Pt is zerovalent, except at its surface."
[5] "The use of a second metal in the catalytic clusters also significantly affects the activity and selectivity for CC bond scission reactions in n-hexane conversion."
[6] "For example, CuPt/SiO2 and PtAu/SiO2 catalysts derived from molecular metal cluster precursors were found to be about 630 times less active than Pt/SiO2."

1. The bimetallic catalysts that are most thoroughly studied and resemble monophasic alloys are those composed of platinum-group metals like iridium (Ir) and palladium (Pd) in relatively large sizes (around 20-30 Å in diameter). These catalysts exhibit properties similar to those of bulk metals.

2. When preparation conditions are gentle enough, the oxophilic metal-noble metal bonds in bimetallic catalysts can remain largely undisturbed post-activation, leading to catalysts with distinct properties.

3. The majority of bimetallic catalysts discussed in this section contained metals in their zerovalent state.

4. In auto exhaust catalysts, rhodium (Rh) might be partially cationic and partially zerovalent, with palladium (Pt) being zerovalent except at its surface.

5. Incorporating a second metal into the catalytic clusters notably influences the activity and selectivity for cleaving CC bonds in the conversion of n-hexane.

6. Catalysts like CuPt/SiO2 and PtAu/SiO2, derived from molecular metal cluster precursors, were found to be approximately 630 times less active than pure platinum (Pt)/SiO2 catalysts.

1. 最为深入研究且与单相合金相似的双金属催化剂，是由铂族元素如铱（Ir）和钯（Pd）组成的较大尺寸（约20-30 Å直径）的催化剂。这些催化剂的性质类似于纯金属。

2. 当准备条件足够温和时，激活后的双金属催化剂中的亲氧金属-贵金属键可以保持大部分不变，导致具有独特性质的催化剂。

3. 在本段讨论的所有双金属催化剂中，大部分金属以零价状态存在。

4. 在汽车尾气催化剂中，铑（Rh）可能部分呈正电性，部分为零价，而钯（Pt）仅在其表面为零价。

5. 将第二金属引入催化簇中显著影响n-己烷转化中切断CC键的活性和选择性。

6. 来自分子金属簇前体的催化剂，如CuPt/SiO2和PtAu/SiO2，被发现比纯铂（Pt）/SiO2催化剂活性低约630倍。
