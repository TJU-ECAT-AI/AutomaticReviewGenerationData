[1] "Combinations of metals provide unique catalytic properties that are not available when only single metals are used."
[2] "For example, species formed by adsorption of Me3SnCo(CO)4 on zeolite NaY were characterized by EXAFS spectroscopy."
[3] "In catalysis by bimetallics containing Ni, the yield of C2C3 hydrocarbons was found to be 30%, whereas the monometallic catalyst gave almost entirely methane."
[4] "The enhancement of catalytic properties of noble metals in CO hydrogenation, especially for formation of higher alcohols, was associated with the presence of heteroatomic MM bimetallic sites in the catalysts."
[5] "The fact that a cluster precursor may be adsorbed intact on a support does not necessarily imply that the bimetallic interaction is preserved during ligand removal."
[6] "The removal of organic ligands from supported bimetallics is not only an important step in the transformation of adsorbed species into catalytically active metal clusters, but it also makes the analysis of EXAFS data simpler."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Ni systems, plays a significant role in various industrial applications like fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts allow for selective transformations of organic compounds, enabling the creation of valuable products with improved efficiency and purity. The methodologies employed to study this process involve both theoretical approaches, such as quantum chemical calculations, and experimental techniques, including spectroscopic analyses, to optimize the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic reactions. 

2. When bimetallic catalysts, particularly those combining noble metals like Pt with other metals like Ni, are used in hydrogenation reactions, they can exhibit enhanced performance compared to monometallic catalysts. For instance, in the hydrogenation of certain compounds, the yield of desired products, such as alcohols, is significantly higher when using bimetallic catalysts. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic interactions between the metals within the catalyst, which enable more efficient activation and recombination of reactants.

3. The EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) spectroscopy technique is crucial for understanding the structure and interactions within bimetallic catalysts. This method allows researchers to analyze the arrangement of atoms around a specific element in a sample, providing insights into the catalytic sites and the nature of interactions between metals and ligands. For example, EXAFS data can reveal whether a metal cluster precursor is adsorbed intact on a support or if the bimetallic interaction is preserved during ligand removal.

4. The catalytic properties of bimetallic clusters, such as the ability to selectively hydrogenate C═O bonds in organic compounds, can vary significantly depending on the composition of the catalyst. The presence of heteroatomic bimetallic sites, for instance, can enhance the efficiency of CO hydrogenation reactions, particularly in the formation of higher alcohols. This is due to the unique electronic and spatial configurations that arise from the interaction between the metals, facilitating the activation and recombination of reactants in a manner that monometallic catalysts cannot achieve.

5. The adsorption of molecular metal clusters on supports like zeolites can lead to the formation of bimetallic species. However, the preservation of the bimetallic interaction during ligand removal is not guaranteed. Factors such as the nature of the support and the strength of the interaction between the metal and the support can influence whether the cluster remains intact or disintegrates upon ligand removal.

6. The removal of organic ligands from bimetallic catalysts is a critical step in transforming the catalysts into active forms suitable for catalytic reactions. This process simplifies the analysis of EXAFS data by reducing the complexity of the system. By studying the changes in the structure and interactions of the metals post-ligand removal, researchers can gain deeper insights into the mechanism of catalysis and optimize the catalyst design for enhanced performance.

1. 使用铂-镍等双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化，在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域发挥着重要作用。这些催化剂能够实现有机化合物的选择性转化，提高产品的纯度和效率。研究这类过程的方法结合了理论计算（如量子化学）和实验技术（如光谱分析），以优化催化反应的选择性和效率。

2. 当使用双金属催化剂，特别是铂与镍等金属组合时，在某些化合物的氢化反应中，相比于单一金属催化剂，可以观察到更高的性能提升。例如，在氢化反应中，通过使用双金属催化剂，特定产物（如醇类）的产率显著增加。这种改进归因于催化剂中金属之间的协同作用，使反应物的激活和重组更加有效。

3. 扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱技术对于理解双金属催化剂的结构和相互作用至关重要。这种方法允许研究人员分析样品中围绕特定元素的原子排列，提供有关催化位点和金属与配体之间性质的洞察。例如，EXAFS数据可以揭示金属簇前体是否完整吸附在支撑材料上，或者在配体去除过程中是否保留了双金属相互作用。

4. 双金属簇的催化性质，如选择性氢化C═O键的能力，可以根据催化剂的组成而变化。含有异原子的双金属位点可以增强CO氢化反应的效率，特别是在醇类的形成中。这是由于金属之间独特的电子和空间配置，使反应物的激活和重组方式不同于单一金属催化剂。

5. 分子金属簇在沸石等支撑材料上的吸附会导致双金属物种的形成。然而，在配体去除过程中，双金属相互作用是否得以保留并非必然。支持材料的性质和金属与支持材料之间相互作用的强度等因素会影响簇是否保持完整或在配体去除后分解。

6. 从催化剂中去除有机配体是将其转化为适合催化反应活性形式的关键步骤。这个过程简化了EXAFS数据分析，因为减少了系统的复杂性。通过研究金属在配体去除后的结构和相互作用变化，研究人员可以获得对催化机制的更深层次理解，并优化催化剂设计以提高性能。

[1] "Among the supported bimetallics that are best investigated and most like monophasic alloys are the ones that are relatively large (about 2030 Å or more in diameter) and contain two platinum-group metals (e.g., Ir and Pt). These have properties not greatly different from those of the bulk metals."
[2] "However, when the preparation conditions are sufficiently mild and the two metals are strongly enough bonded to each other, the oxophilic metalnoble metal bonds may remain largely intact in the activated catalyst."
[3] "The metals in almost all bimetallics reported in the preceding paragraphs of this section were evidently zerovalent."
[4] "For example, in auto exhaust catalysts, the supported Rh may be partly cationic and partly zerovalent while the Pt is zerovalent, except at its surface."
[5] "The use of a second metal in the catalytic clusters also significantly affects the activity and selectivity for CC bond scission reactions in n-hexane conversion."
[6] "For example, CuPt/SiO2 and PtAu/SiO2 catalysts derived from molecular metal cluster precursors were found to be about 630 times less active than Pt/SiO2."
