The study investigates the impact of iron (Fe) on the properties of silica-supported platinum (SiO2-supported Pt) catalysts, focusing on their structure, chemisorption characteristics, and catalytic activities. The researchers synthesized a series of PtFe/SiO2 catalysts with varying Pt/Fe ratios using H2PtCl6 and Fe(NO3)3 as precursors. The catalysts were characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. The researchers measured the hydrogen chemisorption, EXAFS, FTIR, and catalytic activities of the catalysts for the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO), the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral.

研究考察了铁（Fe）对二氧化硅支持的铂（SiO2支持的Pt）催化剂的影响，重点关注其结构、化学吸附性质和催化活性。研究人员使用H2PtCl6和Fe(NO3)3作为前体合成了具有不同Pt/Fe比的一系列PtFe/SiO2催化剂。这些催化剂通过高分辨率透射电子显微镜（HRTEM）、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）和扩展X射线吸收精细结构（EXAFS）光谱进行了表征。研究人员测量了催化剂对一氧化碳（CO）的氧化、环己烷的脱氢以及柠檬醛选择性氢化的能力。
