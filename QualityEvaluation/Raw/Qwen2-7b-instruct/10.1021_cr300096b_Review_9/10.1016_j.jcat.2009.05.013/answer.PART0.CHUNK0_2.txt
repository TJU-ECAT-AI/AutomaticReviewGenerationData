The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. In the context of this research, the catalytic oxidation of CO in air, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and the selective hydrogenation of citral are highlighted. These processes are crucial in industries such as petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and biofuels production. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches. Theoretical studies often rely on computational chemistry techniques, including quantum mechanics and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to understand the electronic interactions and reactivity mechanisms involved in the catalytic processes. Experimentally, researchers use advanced characterization techniques like X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to analyze the structure and reactivity of the catalysts. Kinetic studies are conducted to determine reaction rates and pathways, while catalytic tests are performed under controlled conditions to assess the performance of the catalysts for specific reactions. The results of these studies are then used to optimize catalyst composition, structure, and operating conditions to achieve higher selectivity and efficiency in the desired reactions.
