          "Both thermal and catalytic decomposition of diborane resulting in borane as the main product were investigated under the pressure and temperature ranges of 215 bar and 100300 C, respectively over Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 in a fixed bed reactor. Catalytic decomposition rate was essentially higher than the thermal decomposition, however the catalyst deactivation was substantial."
          "Catalytic decomposition rate was essentially higher than the thermal decomposition, however the catalyst deactivation was substantial."
          "The catalytic process led to a notably higher decomposition rate compared to thermal methods, yet the catalyst experienced significant deactivation."
          "The study involved examining both thermal and catalytic decomposition of diborane to produce borane as the primary product under pressure and temperature conditions ranging from 215 bar to 100-300°C using Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 in a fixed bed reactor."
