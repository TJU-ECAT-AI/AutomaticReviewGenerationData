          The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications, including the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those like Pt-Ni systems, often exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that distinguish them from their parent metals. The main objectives of this study involve exploring the enhanced activity of NiPt bimetallic catalysts in CO bond hydrogenation and verifying predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and surface science experiments in supported catalysts. The results demonstrate that NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts display significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts, highlighting the potential of supported bimetallic catalysts for efficient hydrogenation processes. This study establishes a direct link between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a promising and efficient method for designing effective hydrogenation bimetallic catalysts.

The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes is a critical model reaction, and it has been shown that modified platinum catalysts with tin, germanium, or iron additives have significantly higher selectivity for aldehyde hydrogenation compared to non-modified catalysts. The interaction depicted in Scheme 1 necessitates the formation of Snn+Pt cluster sites, which are ionic Snn+ species either anchored at the metal site or at the metal-support interface. In catalysts with SnO2 support, there is a synergistic effect between the oxide and metal phases. By using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4, Snanch/Pts ratios of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3 were achieved, respectively. To validate the assumption, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with various Snanch/Pts ratios were synthesized. The tin anchoring reaction was monitored over 1.57 hours by determining the amount of C2H6, C2H4, or CH4 produced. Detailed information about the catalyst preparation and test outcomes will be summarized in this study. The maximum coordinative unsaturation was achieved when the tin anchoring occurred with excess gas-phase hydrogen. The experimental data in Table 3 show that under the following tin anchoring conditions, the Snanch/Pts ratio can be substantially increased: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4; (ii) extended reaction duration; (iii) increased reaction temperature; (iv) use of excess hydrogen; (v) oxygen addition during tin anchoring. The Pt/SiO2 catalyst undergoes undesired decarbonylation, yielding C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO. In this reaction, a similar pattern to the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CA is observed, where the introduction of tin markedly accelerates the reaction rate and results in a notable increase in selectivity. At higher CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.8 to 1.2 showed the highest activity, whereas at lower CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.4 to 0.5 exhibited the greatest activity.

Catalysis Letters focused on the study of catalytic processes, specifically examining the segregation of Pt and Re during the carbon dioxide reforming of methane.

The maximum coordinative unsaturation was achieved when the tin anchoring occurred with excess gas-phase hydrogen. The experimental data in Table 3 show that under the following tin anchoring conditions, the Snanch/Pts ratio can be substantially increased: (i) high initial concentration of Sn(C2H5)4; (ii) extended reaction duration; (iii) increased reaction temperature; (iv) use of excess hydrogen; (v) oxygen addition during tin anchoring. The Pt/SiO2 catalyst undergoes undesired decarbonylation, yielding C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO. In this reaction, a similar pattern to the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CA is observed, where the introduction of tin markedly accelerates the reaction rate and results in a notable increase in selectivity. At higher CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.8 to 1.2 showed the highest activity, whereas at lower CO partial pressures, catalysts with Snanch/Pts ratios around 0.4 to 0.5 exhibited the greatest activity.

Catalysis Letters focused on the study of catalytic processes, specifically examining the segregation of Pt and Re during the carbon dioxide reforming of methane. These studies suggest that the segregation enhances the availability of Pt sites for the decomposition of methane, leading to an increased conversion rate of methane over time. This outcome is comparable to the conversion rate observed with a monometallic catalyst, indicating the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of the reaction.

Hydrogenation of furfural can occur in either liquid or vapor phase. Industrially, this process is carried out under high temperature and pressure conditions using a CuCr catalyst, which shows moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural has been extensively researched with catalysts including Ni, Co, Ru, and Pd, sometimes enhanced with additional metals or promoters to boost activity and/or selectivity. Our research group's past studies have demonstrated that adding Sn to Pt-based systems yields more effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of numerous unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The conversion rate over time for the hydrogenation of furfural, using 2-propanol as the solvent, is depicted in Figure 2.
