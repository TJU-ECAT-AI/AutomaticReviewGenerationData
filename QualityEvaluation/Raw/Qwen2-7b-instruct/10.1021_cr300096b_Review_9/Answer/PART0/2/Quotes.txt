          [8] "Hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid-phase has been widely studied using catalysts based on Ni, Co, Ru and Pd, sometimes with the addition of a second metal or a promoter to improve the activity and/or the selectivity."

          [3] "The main objectives of the present work are twofold. First, to explore whether the NiPt bimetallic catalyst would show enhanced activity for CO bond hydrogenation. Second, to investigate whether predictions from DFT calculations and surface science experiments would be verified in supported catalysts."

"The hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes (UA) is an important model reaction."
          "It has been demonstrated that supported platinum catalysts modified by tin, germanium or iron have much higher selectivities for the hydrogenation of the aldehyde group than the unmodified one."
          "This interaction, as shown in Scheme 1 , requires the formation of Snn+Pt ensemble sites, i.e. ionic Snn+ species stabilized either at the metal site or the metal-support interface."
          "In SnO2 supported catalysts a synergism between the oxide and the metal phases has been suggested."
          "Upon using Sn(CH3)4, Sn(C2H5)4, and Sn(C4H9)4 the following Snanch/Pts ratios were obtained: 0.6, 0.4, and 0.3, respectively."

          "Over Pt/SiO2 undesired decarbonylation reaction takes place, leading to the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO."
