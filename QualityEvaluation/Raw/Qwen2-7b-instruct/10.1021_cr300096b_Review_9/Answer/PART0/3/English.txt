The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enhancing the conversion of methane through improved selectivity and efficiency. In the study of PtRe supported on Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2 for carbon dioxide reforming of methane at 800°C, it was found that segregation of Pt and Re occurs during the reaction. This segregation leads to an increase in the availability of Pt sites for CH4 decomposition, resulting in a higher conversion rate of methane over time. Notably, after 20 hours of reaction, the methane conversion observed for the bimetallic catalyst matched that of the monometallic catalyst, indicating the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in this context.
