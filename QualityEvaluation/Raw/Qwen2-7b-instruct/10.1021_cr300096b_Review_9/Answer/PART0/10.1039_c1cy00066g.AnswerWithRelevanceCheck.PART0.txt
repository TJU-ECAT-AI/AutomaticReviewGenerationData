          How does the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contribute to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, and what methodologies are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains?

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications, including the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those like Pt-Ni systems, often exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties that distinguish them from their parent metals. The main objectives of this study involve exploring the enhanced activity of NiPt bimetallic catalysts in CO bond hydrogenation and verifying predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and surface science experiments in supported catalysts. The results demonstrate that NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts display significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts, highlighting the potential of supported bimetallic catalysts for efficient hydrogenation processes. This study establishes a direct link between model surfaces and supported catalysts, offering a promising and efficient method for designing effective hydrogenation bimetallic catalysts.
