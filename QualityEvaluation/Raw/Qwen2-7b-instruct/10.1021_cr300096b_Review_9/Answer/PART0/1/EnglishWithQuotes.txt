To validate the hypothesis, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with varying Snanch/Pts ratios were synthesized. The results from tin anchoring experiments show that under favorable conditions, the Snanch/Pts ratio significantly exceeds monolayer coverage. The Pt/SiO2 catalysts exhibit undesired decarbonylation, resulting in the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO. The introduction of tin notably increases both the reaction rate and the selectivity of crotylalcohol (SCO). Similar trends were observed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, indicating that tin significantly enhances the reaction rate and leads to a pronounced increase in selectivity.
