The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is optimized through methodologies that aim to enhance its selectivity and efficiency across both theoretical and experimental domains.

Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications. It contributes to fine chemical synthesis, enabling the creation of valuable compounds through the selective hydrogenation of reactive functional groups. In the context of cellulosic biomass conversion, CO bond hydrogenation is seen as a pivotal step, facilitating the transformation of renewable resources into useful products. Moreover, studying the hydrogenation of propanal, a potential byproduct of acrolein hydrogenation, offers insights into selectively hydrogenating α,β-unsaturated aldehyde CO bonds. This knowledge aids in the development of efficient catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and the catalytic processing of cellulose, advancing sustainable chemical production methods.

The paper focuses on the detailed aspects of catalyst design incorporating tin tetraalkyls, highlighting the importance of hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes as a model reaction. It emphasizes the role of ionic species in modified platinum catalysts and introduces an alternative reaction mechanism involving the PtSnO2 interface for CO activation. To validate the hypothesis, Sn-Pt/SiO2 catalysts with varying Snanch/Pts ratios were synthesized. The results from tin anchoring experiments show that under favorable conditions, the Snanch/Pts ratio significantly exceeds monolayer coverage. The Pt/SiO2 catalysts exhibit undesired decarbonylation, resulting in the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO. The introduction of tin notably increases both the reaction rate and the selectivity of crotylalcohol (SCO). Similar trends were observed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde, indicating that tin significantly enhances the reaction rate and leads to a pronounced increase in selectivity. The catalyst behavior is highly dependent on the CO partial pressure.

The catalytic decomposition of diborane was found to be more efficient than its thermal counterpart, albeit with significant catalyst deactivation.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for enhanced selectivity and efficiency in converting feedstocks into desired products. Studies employing methodologies such as diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction have revealed that during the reaction, segregation of metals like Pt and Re occurs on the catalyst surface. This segregation increases the availability of active sites for the decomposition of molecules like methane, leading to improved conversion rates over time. For instance, in the case of Pt-Re supported on Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2, the bimetallic catalyst demonstrated comparable methane conversion efficiency to a monometallic catalyst after 20 hours of reaction.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, especially those with the lowest tin content, show high selectivity and efficiency in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. These catalysts allow achieving a high yield of furfuryl alcohol, with selectivities ranging from 96% to 98%. When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but they still maintain high selectivity to furfuryl alcohol.
