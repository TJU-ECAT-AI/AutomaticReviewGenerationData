          "Results of tin anchoring obtained (i) in the absence of gas-phase hydrogen, (ii) in excess hydrogen, and (iii) in the presence of small amount of oxygen strongly indicate (see Table 3 ) that under favorable experimental conditions the Snanch/Pts ratio strongly exceeds the monolayer coverage."
          "Over Pt/SiO2 undesired decarbonylation reaction takes place, leading to the formation of C3 hydrocarbons and chemisorbed CO."
          "The introduction of tin leads to significant increase of both the rate and the SCO selectivity."
          "In this reaction similar trend has been observed as in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of CA, i.e. the introduction of tin strongly increased the reaction rate and led to a very pronounced selectivity increase."
          "The behavior of catalysts shows a very pronounced dependence on the CO partial pressure."

"Both thermal and catalytic decomposition of diborane resulting in borane as the main product were investigated under the pressure and temperature ranges of 215 bar and 100300 C, respectively over Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 in a fixed bed reactor. Catalytic decomposition rate was essentially higher than the thermal decomposition, however the catalyst deactivation was substantial."
          "Catalytic decomposition rate was essentially higher than the thermal decomposition, however the catalyst deactivation was substantial."
          "The catalytic process led to a notably higher decomposition rate compared to thermal methods, yet the catalyst experienced significant deactivation."
          "The study involved examining both thermal and catalytic decomposition of diborane to produce borane as the primary product under pressure and temperature conditions ranging from 215 bar to 100-300°C using Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 in a fixed bed reactor."

[1] "PtRe supported on Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2 was studied for the carbon dioxide reforming of methane at 800 C."
          [2] "Diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction studies suggest that Pt and Re segregation occurs during the reaction."
          [3] "The segregation results in an increase in the Pt sites available for CH4 decomposition and results in the bimetallic catalyst exhibiting an increase in the conversion of methane with time on stream."
          [4] "After 20 h of reaction, the CH4 conversion observed for the bimetallic catalyst was the same as the CH4 conversion observed for the monometallic catalyst."

[1] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry."
          [2] "Due to the wide variety of compounds available, it is attractive to design systems that are highly selective to the desired product, furfuryl alcohol."
          [3] "The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase."
          [4] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds."
          [5] "When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol."
