[4] "Differences in activity for skeletal rearrangements can be explained in terms of the cyclic mechanism of isomerization and support the characterization data that very small and bimetallic particles are prepared using the cluster precursors."
[5] "Both of the cluster-derived catalysts have very similar light hydrocarbon distribution patterns and favor internal rather than terminal bond scission."
[6] "At the same time, the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst has significantly enhanced resistance to deactivation processes relative to the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst and a traditionally prepared Pt catalyst."

1. Ligand-stabilized organometallic cluster precursors are used to prepare bimetallic catalysts that are effective in alkane conversion reactions.
2. The 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst has a high selectivity for producing lighter hydrocarbons and exhibits significantly faster CC bond fission rates compared to other catalysts.
3. The DRIFTS spectrum of the catalyst reveals a broad and asymmetric peak related to CO bound to Pt, suggesting overlapping linear PtCO stretches and bridging or semibridging CO modes between Pt and Cu.
4. The enhanced selectivity for skeletal rearrangements can be attributed to the cyclic mechanism of isomerization and is supported by the characterization data showing small and bimetallic particle sizes.
5. The cluster-derived catalysts exhibit similar light hydrocarbon distribution patterns, favoring internal bond scission over terminal scission.
6. The 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst shows improved resistance to deactivation processes compared to the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst and traditional Pt catalysts.

1. 使用配体稳定化的有机金属簇前体制备的双金属催化剂在烷烃转化反应中表现出活性。
2. 0.15-Pt2Cu4 催化剂具有较高的轻烃产物选择性，并且其碳碳键断裂速率显著高于其他催化剂。
3. 催化剂的DRIFTS光谱显示一个宽而不对称的峰与吸附在Pt上的CO相关，这可能是因为Pt和Cu之间的线性PtCO伸展重叠以及半桥接或桥接模式中的CO。
4. 通过环状机制的异构化解释了骨架重排差异，这与使用簇前体制备的小而双金属粒子的表征数据相一致。
5. 这两类簇衍生催化剂具有相似的轻烃分布模式，倾向于内部而不是终端键裂解。
6. 0.15-Pt2Au4 催化剂在去活化过程中的耐受性明显优于0.15-Pt2Cu4催化剂和传统Pt催化剂。
