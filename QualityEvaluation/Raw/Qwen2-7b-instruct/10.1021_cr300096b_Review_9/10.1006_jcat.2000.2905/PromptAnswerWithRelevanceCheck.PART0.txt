[2] "Results with the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst indicate that this is not merely due to a lesser degree of successive terminal hydrogenolysis reactions by the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst; rather, it may be an intrinsic property of Au that is expressed by the bimetallic particles prepared using the cluster precursor method."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes enable the creation of valuable compounds from renewable resources and the modification of existing chemicals. The selectivity and efficiency of this process are enhanced through the optimization of catalyst design, reaction conditions, and the development of novel methodologies. The study employs both theoretical approaches, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental methods, including spectroscopy, catalytic tests, and characterization techniques, to understand and improve the performance of the catalysts. In the context of the document, the enhanced selectivity for the production of lighter hydrocarbons in the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst compared to the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst indicates that the intrinsic property of Au, when combined with Pt using the cluster precursor method, contributes to its resistance to deactivation. This is not solely due to a reduced level of successive terminal hydrogenolysis reactions, suggesting a unique catalytic behavior of the Au-bearing particles.
