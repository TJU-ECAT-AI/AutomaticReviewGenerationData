[1] "Both the 0.15-Pt2Au4 and 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts have enhanced selectivity for the production of lighter hydrocarbons; the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalysts in particular have significantly increased rates of CC bond fission."
[2] "Results with the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst indicate that this is not merely due to a lesser degree of successive terminal hydrogenolysis reactions by the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst; rather, it may be an intrinsic property of Au that is expressed by the bimetallic particles prepared using the cluster precursor method."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes enable the creation of valuable compounds from renewable resources and the modification of existing chemicals. The selectivity and efficiency of this process are enhanced through the optimization of catalyst design, reaction conditions, and the development of novel methodologies. The study employs both theoretical approaches, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental methods, including spectroscopy, catalytic tests, and characterization techniques, to understand and improve the performance of the catalysts. In the context of the document, the enhanced selectivity for the production of lighter hydrocarbons in the 0.15-Pt2Cu4 catalyst compared to the 0.15-Pt2Au4 catalyst indicates that the intrinsic property of Au, when combined with Pt using the cluster precursor method, contributes to its resistance to deactivation. This is not solely due to a reduced level of successive terminal hydrogenolysis reactions, suggesting a unique catalytic behavior of the Au-bearing particles.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用铂-镍等双金属催化剂，对工业和研究应用如精细化学品合成和木质素生物转化具有重要意义。这些过程允许从可再生资源创造有价值的化合物，并对现有化学品进行修改。通过优化催化剂设计、反应条件以及开发新型方法，可以提高此过程的选择性和效率。研究采用理论方法（如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算）和实验方法（包括光谱学、催化测试和表征技术），以理解和改进催化剂性能。在文档的背景下，15-Pt2Cu4催化剂相对于15-Pt2Au4催化剂在生产轻质烃方面的增强选择性表明，当使用簇前体方法结合Pt和Au时，Au的内在性质对其去活性的抵抗力做出了贡献。这不仅仅是由于15-Pt2Au4催化剂中连续终端氢解反应程度较低，而是表明Au载有的颗粒具有独特的催化行为。
