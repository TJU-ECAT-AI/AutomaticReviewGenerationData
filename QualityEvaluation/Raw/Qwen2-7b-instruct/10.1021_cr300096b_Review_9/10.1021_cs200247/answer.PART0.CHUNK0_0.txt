[1] "Our data show that Pt in the nanostructured PtmAu catalysts served as an efficient activity promoter to Au NPs in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds, by creating a new channel for H2 activation."
[2] "The high activity of PtmAu nanostructures also remained distinct on interacting support materials such as Al2O3 and carbon and when varying the reaction temperature, H2 pressure, or both."
[3] "Kinetic modeling of the hydrogenation reaction on PtmAu/SiO2 (Table 5) further indicates that H2 and CAL would not compete for the same kind of adsorption sites: they adsorb respectively on two kinds of active sites with different properties in the PtmAu nanostructures."
[4] "It is further shown that the catalytic feature of PtmAu was essentially not affected by the nature of their immobilizers or supporting materials."
[5] "The requirement for a proper proximity in maximizing the synergic catalysis could also explain why the bimetallic Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst showed a much lower activity than the Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst (Table 1)."

1. Pt in the nanostructured PtmAu catalysts serves as an efficient promoter for Au NPs in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds, creating a new channel for H2 activation.
2. The high activity of PtmAu nanostructures is maintained on interacting support materials, varying reaction temperatures, H2 pressures, or combinations thereof.
3. Kinetic modeling reveals that H2 and CAL do not compete for the same kind of adsorption sites, instead they adsorb on two distinct types of active sites in the PtmAu nanostructures.
4. The catalytic characteristics of PtmAu are not influenced by the nature of their immobilizers or supporting materials.
5. The bimetallic Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst exhibits lower activity compared to the Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst due to the lack of a proper proximity between Pt and Au sites.

1. 在纳米结构的PtmAu催化剂中，Pt作为Au NPs在α,β不饱和化合物氢化过程中的高效活性促进剂，创建了H2活化的新的途径。
2. PtmAu纳米结构的高活性在与交互支持材料、变化反应温度、H2压力或两者组合的情况下得以保持。
3. 动力学建模表明，H2和CAL不会竞争相同的吸附位点，相反它们分别在PtmAu纳米结构上的两种不同性质的活性位点上吸附。
4. PtmAu的催化特性不受其固定化载体或支撑材料性质的影响。
5. 由于Pt和Au之间的适当接近度不足，双金属Pt0.05Au/SiO2催化剂的活性低于Pt0.05Au/SiO2催化剂。
