1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes are studied and optimized across theoretical and experimental domains by employing methodologies that focus on enhancing selectivity and efficiency.

2. The presence of fully dispersed Pt deposits on Au nanoparticles (NPs) can significantly boost the activity of Au NPs in chemoselective hydrogenation reactions of α,β-unsaturated compounds without altering the selectivity of Au NPs. This synergy between Au and Pt NPs results in highly active nanogold catalysts suitable for demanding hydrogenation reactions.

3. The synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt entities in the hydrogenation of compounds like cinnamaldehyde is insensitive to changes in reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure, demonstrating the dominance of Pt in the activation process. This characteristic makes the Pt-Au nanostructures valuable for developing highly active catalysts for selectivity-demanding hydrogenation reactions.

4. The optimized and maintained selectivity of Au catalysts in novel PtmAu nanostructures implies that these catalysts could play a crucial role in the development of highly active nanogold catalysts for various hydrogenation reactions, particularly those requiring high selectivity.
