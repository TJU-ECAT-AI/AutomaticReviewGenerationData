[1] "Our data show that Pt in the nanostructured PtmAu catalysts served as an efficient activity promoter to Au NPs in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds, by creating a new channel for H2 activation."
[2] "The requirement for a proper proximity in maximizing the synergic catalysis could also explain why the bimetallic Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst showed a much lower activity than the Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst."
[3] "The Au NPs immobilized on the interacting Al2O3 and Vulcan XC-72 carbon showed significantly higher activity and lower selectivity for HCAL than the standard Au/SiO2 catalyst for the hydrogenation reaction of CAL."
[4] "These facts would demonstrate that the synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt well overweighed the effect of Ausupport interaction on the hydrogenation catalysis."
[5] "The product selectivity over PtmAu/SiO2 catalysts appeared also insensitive to the reaction temperature and H2 pressure, which is again in strong contrast with the results obtained over the standard Au/SiO2 catalyst."

1. Pt in the nanostructured PtmAu catalysts serves as an efficient activator for Au NPs in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds, creating a new pathway for H2 activation.

2. The necessity for an appropriate proximity is crucial in maximizing the synergistic catalysis.

3. The Au NPs immobilized on interacting Al2O3 and Vulcan XC-72 carbon demonstrated higher activity and lower selectivity for HCAL compared to the standard Au/SiO2 catalyst in the hydrogenation of CAL.

4. The synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt predominates over the effect of Au-support interaction in the hydrogenation catalysis.

5. The product selectivity remains insensitive to reaction temperature and H2 pressure when using PtmAu/SiO2 catalysts, contrasting with the outcomes observed with standard Au/SiO2 catalysts.

1.PtmAu纳米结构催化剂中的Pt作为α,β-不饱和化合物氢化反应中Au纳米颗粒的有效激活剂，通过创建新的H2活化途径发挥作用。

2.实现协同催化作用最大化需要适当的接近性。

3.固定在Al2O3和Vulcan XC-72碳上的Au纳米颗粒在CAL氢化反应中的活性更高，选择性更低，与标准的Au/SiO2催化剂相比。

4.PtmAu/SiO2催化剂中的Au纳米颗粒与其携带的Pt之间的协同效应大于Au支持交互对氢化催化的影响。

5.CAL氢化反应中使用PtmAu/SiO2催化剂时，产品选择性对反应温度和H2压力的变化不敏感，这与标准Au/SiO2催化剂的结果形成鲜明对比。
