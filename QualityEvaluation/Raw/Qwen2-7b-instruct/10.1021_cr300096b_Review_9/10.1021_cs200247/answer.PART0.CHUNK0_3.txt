[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, including cinnamaldehyde (CAL),... is a critical route in the syntheses of many important chemicals, such as fragrances, pharmaceuticals, and others."
[2] "Pt dispersion or the size of the Pt entities and PtAu boundary, as well, strongly affected this synergic catalysis."
[3] "The synergy depended critically on the dispersion of Pt entities and the PtAu proximity, but it was hardly affected by the temperature and H2 pressure of the reaction."
[4] "The well-maintained selectivity propensity for the hydrogenation reactions of Au catalyst in these novel PtmAu nanostructures would have important implications for developing highly active nanogold catalysts."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, like cinnamaldehyde, plays a crucial role in synthesizing various chemicals, including fragrances and pharmaceuticals.

2. The efficiency and effectiveness of Pt entities in catalytic hydrogenation processes depend significantly on their dispersion, the size of the Pt entities, and the proximity between Pt and Au in the nanostructure.

3. The synergy between Pt and Au in the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated compounds, especially in the context of Pt-on-Au nanostructures, remains largely unaffected by changes in reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure.

4. The ability to maintain selectivity in the hydrogenation reactions using Au catalysts within novel Pt-on-Au nanostructures suggests potential for developing highly active nanogold catalysts with improved selectivity.

1. 催化氢化α,β不饱和醛，例如肉桂醛，对于合成多种化学品（如香料、药物等）至关重要。

2. 在催化氢化过程中，Pt实体的效率和有效性在很大程度上取决于其分散度、Pt实体的大小以及Pt与Au之间的接近程度。

3. 在Pt-on-Au纳米结构中，Pt和Au在氢化α,β不饱和化合物时的协同作用受到温度和氢气压力变化的影响较小。

4. 在这些新型Pt-on-Au纳米结构中使用Au催化剂保持选择性表明有可能开发出具有更好选择性的高活性纳米金催化剂。
