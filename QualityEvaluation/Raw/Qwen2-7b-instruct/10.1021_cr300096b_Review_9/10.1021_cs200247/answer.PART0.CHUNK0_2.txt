[1] "The overall reaction rate was determined by a LangmuirHinshelwood surface reaction step between independently adsorbed CAL and H atoms over the PtmAu/SiO2 catalysts."
[2] "The requirement for a proper proximity in maximizing the synergic catalysis could also explain why the bimetallic Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst showed a much lower activity than the Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst (Table 1)."
[3] "These facts would demonstrate that the synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt well overweighed the effect of Ausupport interaction on the hydrogenation catalysis (Table 1)."
[4] "The product selectivity over PtmAu/SiO2 catalysts appeared also insensitive to the reaction temperature and H2 pressure (Tables 2 and 3),"

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This is because these catalysts can selectively hydrogenate functional groups in complex molecules, leading to the production of desired products with high purity and yield. The selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process are studied and optimized using a combination of theoretical approaches, such as kinetic modeling, and experimental methods, including catalyst characterization and reaction testing under various conditions.

2. The presence of fully dispersed Pt entities on the surface of Au NPs plays a crucial role in the hydrogenation process. These Pt entities function as efficient activity promoters for Au NPs, enabling the creation of a new channel for H2 activation. This synergy between Pt and Au leads to an improved catalytic activity, especially when the Pt entities are fully dispersed, maximizing the proximity between Pt and Au sites. This proximity is essential for maximizing the synergistic catalysis.

3. The catalytic hydrogenation process using bimetallic catalysts, like Pt0.05Au/SiO2, shows a significant difference in activity compared to the standard Au/SiO2 catalyst. The Pt0.05Au/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a much higher activity, demonstrating that the synergy between Au NPs and their carrying Pt outweighs the effect of Au-support interaction on the hydrogenation catalysis. This highlights the importance of Pt in enhancing the activity of Au NPs in hydrogenation reactions.

4. The product selectivity in the hydrogenation process using Pt-Ni systems or bimetallic Pt-Au catalysts appears insensitive to changes in reaction temperature and H2 pressure. This suggests that the presence of fully dispersed Pt entities on the surface of Au NPs favors a specific adsorption mode for the reactants, which remains stable under varying conditions. This stability in product selectivity is a crucial aspect for developing highly active nanocatalysts that can maintain selective hydrogenation capabilities under diverse reaction conditions.

1. Pt-Ni复合催化剂或Pt-Au双金属催化剂在精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化等工业与研究领域中的催化氢化反应，对功能基团的选择性氢化具有显著贡献。通过这些催化剂可以精确地将复杂分子中的功能基团氢化，生成高纯度、高产率的目标产物。氢化过程的选择性和效率通过理论方法（如动力学建模）和实验手段（如催化剂表征和不同条件下的反应测试）进行研究和优化。

2. Au纳米颗粒表面完全分散的Pt实体在氢化过程中扮演关键角色。这些Pt实体作为Au活性位点的高效促进剂，能够创建新的H2激活通道，从而增强Au的催化活性。在Pt完全分散时，通过最大化Pt-Au界面，可以实现最佳的协同催化作用。

3. Pt0.05Au/SiO2复合催化剂相对于标准的Au/SiO2催化剂表现出更高的活性差异。这表明Au纳米颗粒与携带的Pt之间的协同效应大于Au与支持物之间的相互作用对氢化催化性能的影响。这强调了Pt在提高Au纳米颗粒氢化能力方面的重要性。

4. 使用Pt-Ni系统或Pt-Au双金属催化剂进行的氢化过程的产品选择性在反应温度和H2压力变化的情况下保持不变。这表明，Au纳米颗粒表面完全分散的Pt实体对反应物的特定吸附模式有稳定的偏好，这种稳定性对于在各种反应条件下保持选择性氢化能力的高性能催化剂的发展至关重要。
