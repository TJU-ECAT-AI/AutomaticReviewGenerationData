The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly through the use of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling selective and efficient transformations of biomaterials into valuable chemicals. This process is studied and optimized using methodologies that encompass both theoretical and experimental approaches. For instance, the literature discusses the preparation of tungsten carbide catalysts via carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) methods. These catalysts are then employed in the conversion of cellulose into polyols, notably ethylene glycol (EG), with notable improvements achieved through the promotion with nickel. This not only reduces the reliance on precious metals but also enhances the yield of desired products, such as EG, aligning with the growing demand for EG in sectors like plastics manufacturing and automotive industries.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by providing an environmentally friendly and cost-effective means to convert cellulose into valuable organic compounds. This process involves the use of tungsten carbide (W2C) catalysts, which are capable of efficiently converting cellulose into polyols, including ethylene glycol (EG), with high yields. Nickel promotes the formation of W2C, leading to a synergistic effect that increases the yield of EG when used in conjunction with W2C. This method offers a significant advantage over precious metal catalysts due to its lower cost and environmental benefits. Additionally, the use of less expensive carbides in place of noble metals for biomass conversion reactions addresses concerns related to the scarcity and high price of precious metals, making it a promising approach for sustainable chemical production from renewable resources.

<p>Cellulose, the most abundant source of biomass, is currently regarded as a promising alternative for fossil fuels as it cannot be digested by human beings and thus its use, unlike corn and starch, will not impose a negative impact on food supplies.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of the above two studies is the use of precious-metal catalysts. The amount of precious metals needed for the degradation of cellulose was relatively high, 410mg per gram of cellulose. This is too expensive for the conversion of large quantities of cellulose, even though the solid catalyst could be reused.</p>
<p>The conversion of cellulose into polyols was conducted in an aqueous medium, in a similar fashion to procedures reported previously. The optimization of the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and reaction time) over tungsten carbide catalysts showed that the maximum yield of EG was obtained at 518K, 6MPa H2, and with a reaction time of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>In their work, the reaction was conducted at elevated temperatures so that water could generate H+ ions to catalyze the hydrolysis reactions. The subsequent hydrogenation reaction was catalyzed by Ru/C. An increased sugar alcohol yield was obtained, which was attributed to the higher reaction temperatures and the well-known high efficiency of Ru/C in the hydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>W2C/AC and nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts were prepared by a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method following our previous report and the method of Liang et al.

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The methodology involves using tungsten carbide catalysts promoted with a small amount of nickel, which leads to a high yield of ethylene glycol (EG) relative to other polyols. This process utilizes a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method followed by characterization through XRD and TEM to understand the phase evolution and particle size distribution. The catalysts are optimized for reaction conditions including temperature, pressure, and reaction time to achieve maximum yield. The results demonstrate that the use of less expensive carbides, specifically nickel-promoted tungsten carbide, can replace precious metal catalysts, leading to an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method for converting cellulose into valuable chemicals.

2. The selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process are enhanced by the synergy between nickel and tungsten carbides. Nickel promotes the formation of tungsten carbides, which increases the catalytic activity. The optimal nickel loading is 2 wt%, and the optimal CHR temperature is 973K, resulting in a high yield of ethylene glycol (61%) and low yields of other polyols. The catalysts show good reusability, with slight losses in the yield of ethylene glycol observed during recycling due to slight oxidation of the W2C phase by the reaction medium.

In conclusion, the catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose using nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts provides an environmentally friendly and economically viable method for producing valuable chemicals from renewable resources, particularly ethylene glycol, which is crucial in the petrochemical industry.

<p>Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB).</p>
<p>When the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased. These Ni-W2C/AC catalysts showed a remarkably higher selectivity for EG formation than Pt/Al2O34 and Ru/C.7</p>
<p>The product distribution from the degradation of cellulose is very complex.

<p>The conversion of cellulose into polyols was conducted in an aqueous medium, in a similar fashion to procedures reported previously.4,7 The optimization of the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and reaction time) over tungsten carbide catalysts showed that the maximum yield of EG was obtained at 518K, 6MPa H2, and with a reaction time of 30minutes.</p>
<p>The three W2C/AC catalysts, which were prepared at 1073K but had different tungsten loadings, led to a nearly 100% cellulose conversion; the main product was EG and its yield increased from 23.7% to 29.0% when the tungsten content was increased from 15% to 60% (Table1, entries13).</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the W2C/AC was prepared at a higher temperature, the yield of EG was decreased slightly (Table1, entry4).</p>
<p>In our previous work on hydrazine decomposition,14 alumina-supported tungsten carbides were also found to have an activity inferior to those supported on activated carbon.

<p>To further improve the yield of EG and sugar alcohols, we added a small amount of nickel to the above tungsten carbide catalysts. The presence of even a very small amount of nickel (0.5wt%) in W2C/AC resulted in a substantial increase in the yield of EG from 27.4 to 39.4% (Table1, entry8).</p>
