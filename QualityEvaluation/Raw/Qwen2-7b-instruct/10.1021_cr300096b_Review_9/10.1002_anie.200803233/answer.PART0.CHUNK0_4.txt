<p>Cellulose, the most abundant source of biomass, is currently regarded as a promising alternative for fossil fuels as it cannot be digested by human beings and thus its use, unlike corn and starch, will not impose a negative impact on food supplies.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of the above two studies is the use of precious-metal catalysts. The amount of precious metals needed for the degradation of cellulose was relatively high, 410mg per gram of cellulose. This is too expensive for the conversion of large quantities of cellulose, even though the solid catalyst could be reused.</p>
<p>Herein we report the first observation that carbon-supported tungsten carbide (W2C/AC; AC=activated carbon) can effectively catalyze cellulose conversion into polyols (Scheme1, RouteB).</p>
<p>When the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased. These Ni-W2C/AC catalysts showed a remarkably higher selectivity for EG formation than Pt/Al2O34 and Ru/C.7</p>
<p>The product distribution from the degradation of cellulose is very complex. In addition to the compounds listed in Table1, which include EG, sorbitol, mannitol, erythritol, and 1,2-propylene glycol, two unknown products with a molecular weight of 164 and 132Da were also detected by HPLCESI-MS.</p>
<p>The conversion of cellulose into polyols was conducted in an aqueous medium, in a similar fashion to procedures reported previously.4,7 The optimization of the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and reaction time) over tungsten carbide catalysts showed that the maximum yield of EG was obtained at 518K, 6MPa H2, and with a reaction time of 30minutes.</p>
<p>The three W2C/AC catalysts, which were prepared at 1073K but had different tungsten loadings, led to a nearly 100% cellulose conversion; the main product was EG and its yield increased from 23.7% to 29.0% when the tungsten content was increased from 15% to 60% (Table1, entries13).</p>
<p>On the other hand, when the W2C/AC was prepared at a higher temperature, the yield of EG was decreased slightly (Table1, entry4).</p>
<p>In our previous work on hydrazine decomposition,14 alumina-supported tungsten carbides were also found to have an activity inferior to those supported on activated carbon. This difference has been attributed to the different active phase formed on these two supports: W2C was formed on activated carbon whereas WC was formed on alumina; the metaphase W2C was found to have a higher intrinsic activity than the thermally stable WC.</p>
<p>To further improve the yield of EG and sugar alcohols, we added a small amount of nickel to the above tungsten carbide catalysts. The presence of even a very small amount of nickel (0.5wt%) in W2C/AC resulted in a substantial increase in the yield of EG from 27.4 to 39.4% (Table1, entry8).</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K.</p>
