<p>Cellulose, the most abundant source of biomass, is currently regarded as a promising alternative for fossil fuels as it cannot be digested by human beings and thus its use, unlike corn and starch, will not impose a negative impact on food supplies.</p>
<p>One of the most attractive routes for the reaction of cellulose utilization is its direct conversion into useful organic compounds.</p>
<p>This process occurs in up to 29% yield over a tungsten carbide catalyst, and in up to 61% yield when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel.</p>
<p>Recently, Luo etal. have studied this process further. In their work, the reaction was conducted at elevated temperatures so that water could generate H+ ions to catalyze the hydrolysis reactions. The subsequent hydrogenation reaction was catalyzed by Ru/C.</p>
<p>The product distribution from the degradation of cellulose is very complex. In addition to the compounds listed in Table1, which include EG, sorbitol, mannitol, erythritol, and 1,2-propylene glycol, two unknown products with a molecular weight of 164 and 132Da were also detected by HPLCESI-MS.</p>
<p>When the W2C/AC was prepared at a higher temperature, the yield of EG was decreased slightly (Table1, entry4).</p>
<p>According to the XRD results, treatment of the catalyst precursor with H2 at 1073K produced phase-pure W2C while a mixture of W2C and WC was yielded at 1123K.</p>
<p>The high selectivity of the W2C/AC catalyst in the production of EG suggests that the hydrogenolysis of glucose prevails over its hydrogenation.</p>
<p>Use of catalysts prepared at 1073K resulted in a lower yield of EG and a higher yield of sorbitol (Table1, entries12 and 13) than those prepared at 973K.</p>
<p>Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis of the liquid product shows that leaching of either nickel or tungsten is negligible.</p>
<p>In view of the importance of EG in the petrochemical industry, this approach may open a new avenue for the production of valuable chemicals from renewable resources.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K.</p>

To answer the first question, the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This is achieved through the direct conversion of cellulose into useful organic compounds. Studies focus on optimizing the selectivity and efficiency of this process, employing both theoretical modeling and experimental methodologies. For instance, researchers adjust parameters like temperature, pressure, and reaction time to achieve higher yields of desired products like ethylene glycol (EG). They also investigate the role of different catalysts, including tungsten carbide (W2C) and its promotion with nickel, to enhance the yield of EG relative to other polyols. Additionally, they ensure catalyst reusability and minimize leaching of metals, contributing to environmental sustainability. The synergy between nickel and W2C catalysts is crucial for maximizing efficiency in cellulose degradation processes, offering a promising avenue for producing valuable chemicals from renewable resources.

For the second question, the methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process include the use of advanced characterization techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to understand catalyst properties and behavior. Researchers conduct reactions under controlled conditions, varying factors such as temperature, pressure, and reaction duration, to determine optimal operating parameters. They also perform recycling tests to assess catalyst stability and efficiency over multiple cycles. Furthermore, they employ analytical methods such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to analyze product distributions and quantify yields accurately. These comprehensive approaches enable detailed insights into the catalytic mechanisms and guide the development of more efficient and sustainable processes.
