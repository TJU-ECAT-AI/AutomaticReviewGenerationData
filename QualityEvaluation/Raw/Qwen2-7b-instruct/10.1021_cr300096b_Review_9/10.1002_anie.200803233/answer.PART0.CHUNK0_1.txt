[1] "Nickel saves dimes: The expense of using precious-metal catalysts is avoided in the high-yielding conversion of cellulose to ethylene glycol."
[2] "The product distribution from the degradation of cellulose is very complex. In addition to the compounds listed in Table1, which include EG, sorbitol, mannitol, erythritol, and 1,2-propylene glycol, two unknown products with a molecular weight of 164 and 132Da were also detected by HPLCESI-MS."
[3] "When the reaction was carried out at a lower temperature (463K), the EG yield over Pt/Al2O3 was further decreased to 9.6%, and was accompanied with a sharp increase in the yield of sugar alcohols (26.3% of sorbitol and 8.9% of mannitol, Table1, entry18)."
[4] "Our results show that use of nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts led to a higher yield of EG and sugar alcohols compared to unpromoted catalysts (Table1)."
[5] "Clearly, there is a synergetic effect between nickel and W2C in the reactions involving cellulose degradation, and this synergy was maximized at a nominal nickel loading of 2 wt% and CHR temperature of 973K."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by providing an environmentally friendly and cost-effective means to convert cellulose into valuable organic compounds. This process involves the use of tungsten carbide (W2C) catalysts, which are capable of efficiently converting cellulose into polyols, including ethylene glycol (EG), with high yields. Nickel promotes the formation of W2C, leading to a synergistic effect that increases the yield of EG when used in conjunction with W2C. This method offers a significant advantage over precious metal catalysts due to its lower cost and environmental benefits. Additionally, the use of less expensive carbides in place of noble metals for biomass conversion reactions addresses concerns related to the scarcity and high price of precious metals, making it a promising approach for sustainable chemical production from renewable resources.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用如Pt-Ni系统的双金属催化剂，为精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物转化等工业和研究应用提供了环保且成本效益高的途径。该过程利用钨碳化物（W2C）催化剂，能够高效地将纤维素转化为多元醇，包括乙二醇（EG），具有高产率。镍促进了W2C的形成，与W2C结合时，增加了EG的产率。这种方法相对于贵金属催化剂的优势在于其较低的成本和环境友好性。此外，在生物质转化反应中使用较便宜的碳化物代替贵重金属，解决了贵重金属稀缺和价格高昂的问题，为从可再生资源生产有价值的化学物质开辟了新的途径。
