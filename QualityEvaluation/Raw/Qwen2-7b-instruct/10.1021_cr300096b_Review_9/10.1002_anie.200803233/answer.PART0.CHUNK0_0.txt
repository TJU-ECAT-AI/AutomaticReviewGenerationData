[1] "Nickel saves dimes: The expense of using precious-metal catalysts is avoided in the high-yielding conversion of cellulose to ethylene glycol (see picture; AC=activated carbon)."
[2] "In view of the increasing demand for EG for the manufacture of polyester fibers and resins in the plastics industry and as an antifreeze in the automotive industry, its direct production from cellulose will create a new method for reducing dependence on petroleum."
[3] "More interestingly, when the catalyst is promoted with a small amount of nickel, the yield of polyols, especially ethylene glycol (EG) and sorbitol, can be significantly increased."
[4] "This is the first report that EG can be directly produced from cellulose in such a high yield."
[5] "The global production of EG in 2007 is estimated to be 17.8 million tonnes, an increase of 5.4% from 2006."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly through the use of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling selective and efficient transformations of biomaterials into valuable chemicals. This process is studied and optimized using methodologies that encompass both theoretical and experimental approaches. For instance, the literature discusses the preparation of tungsten carbide catalysts via carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) methods. These catalysts are then employed in the conversion of cellulose into polyols, notably ethylene glycol (EG), with notable improvements achieved through the promotion with nickel. This not only reduces the reliance on precious metals but also enhances the yield of desired products, such as EG, aligning with the growing demand for EG in sectors like plastics manufacturing and automotive industries. The global production of EG, estimated at 17.8 million tonnes in 2007, highlights the significance of developing sustainable and efficient methods for its production, including direct conversion from cellulose.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是通过使用铂镍双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用如精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化具有重要意义。这使生物材料能够选择性且高效地转化为有价值的化学物质。这一过程涉及从理论到实验的方法进行研究和优化。文献中提到，通过热还原碳热法（CHR）方法制备钨碳化物催化剂。这些催化剂随后用于将纤维素转化为聚醇，尤其是乙二醇（EG），通过添加少量镍的促进作用，显著提高了产物的产率，尤其是EG和山梨醇。这不仅减少了对贵金属的依赖，而且提高了所需产品的产率，符合EG在塑料制造和汽车工业等领域的增长需求。2007年全球EG产量估计为1780万吨，突显了开发可持续和高效生产方法的重要性，包括直接从纤维素转化为EG。
