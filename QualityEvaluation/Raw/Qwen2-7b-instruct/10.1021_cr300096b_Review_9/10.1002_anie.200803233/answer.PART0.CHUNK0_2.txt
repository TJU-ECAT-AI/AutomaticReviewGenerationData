<p>Cellulose, the most abundant source of biomass, is currently regarded as a promising alternative for fossil fuels as it cannot be digested by human beings and thus its use, unlike corn and starch, will not impose a negative impact on food supplies.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of the above two studies is the use of precious-metal catalysts. The amount of precious metals needed for the degradation of cellulose was relatively high, 410mg per gram of cellulose. This is too expensive for the conversion of large quantities of cellulose, even though the solid catalyst could be reused.</p>
<p>The conversion of cellulose into polyols was conducted in an aqueous medium, in a similar fashion to procedures reported previously. The optimization of the reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, and reaction time) over tungsten carbide catalysts showed that the maximum yield of EG was obtained at 518K, 6MPa H2, and with a reaction time of 30 minutes.</p>
<p>In their work, the reaction was conducted at elevated temperatures so that water could generate H+ ions to catalyze the hydrolysis reactions. The subsequent hydrogenation reaction was catalyzed by Ru/C. An increased sugar alcohol yield was obtained, which was attributed to the higher reaction temperatures and the well-known high efficiency of Ru/C in the hydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>W2C/AC and nickel-promoted W2C/AC catalysts were prepared by a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method following our previous report and the method of Liang et al. Characterization of the samples showed that the addition of nickel brought about remarkable changes in the evolution of the W2C phase as well as the particle size distribution.</p>
<p>The presence of nickel lowered the W2C formation temperature by approximately 100K, possibly arising from nickel-promoted H2 dissociation and thereby the reduction of the tungsten precursor.</p>
<p>According to the XRD results, treatment of the catalyst precursor with H2 at 1073K produced phase-pure W2C while a mixture of W2C and WC was yielded at 1123K.</p>
<p>This is the first report that EG can be directly produced from cellulose in such a high yield. In view of the importance of EG in the petrochemical industry, this approach may open a new avenue for the production of valuable chemicals from renewable resources.</p>

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the process. The methodology involves using tungsten carbide catalysts promoted with a small amount of nickel, which leads to a high yield of ethylene glycol (EG) relative to other polyols. This process utilizes a carbothermal hydrogen reduction (CHR) method followed by characterization through XRD and TEM to understand the phase evolution and particle size distribution. The catalysts are optimized for reaction conditions including temperature, pressure, and reaction time to achieve maximum yield. The results demonstrate that the use of less expensive carbides, specifically nickel-promoted tungsten carbide, can replace precious metal catalysts, leading to an environmentally friendly and cost-effective method for converting cellulose into valuable chemicals.

2. The selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process are enhanced by the synergy between nickel and tungsten carbides. Nickel promotes the formation of tungsten carbides, which increases the catalytic activity. The optimal nickel loading is 2 wt%, and the optimal CHR temperature is 973K, resulting in a high yield of ethylene glycol (61%) and low yields of other polyols. The catalysts show good reusability, with slight losses in the yield of ethylene glycol observed during recycling due to slight oxidation of the W2C phase by the reaction medium.

In conclusion, the catalytic hydrogenation of cellulose using nickel-promoted tungsten carbide catalysts provides an environmentally friendly and economically viable method for producing valuable chemicals from renewable resources, particularly ethylene glycol, which is crucial in the petrochemical industry.

1. Pt-Ni复合催化剂的催化氢化反应在精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化等领域中发挥着重要作用。采用碳热氢还原（CHR）方法制备钨碳化物催化剂，并通过X射线衍射（XRD）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）表征来理解相演化和颗粒尺寸分布。优化反应条件，如温度、压力和反应时间，以实现最大产率。结果表明，使用价格较低的碳化物，特别是添加少量镍的钨碳化物，可以替代贵金属催化剂，从而提供一种环境友好且成本效益高的方法，用于将纤维素转化为有价值的化学品。

2. 钼碳化物与镍的协同效应提高了催化氢化过程的选择性和效率。镍促进了钼碳化物的形成，增加了催化剂活性。最佳的镍负载为2 wt%，最佳CHR温度为973K，导致乙二醇（EG）的高产率（61%）和其他聚醇的低产率。催化剂具有良好的可回收性，在回收过程中观察到轻微的乙二醇产率降低，这是由于反应介质对钼碳化物相的轻微氧化造成的。

综上所述，使用添加少量镍的钼碳化物作为催化剂的催化氢化纤维素方法提供了一种环境友好且经济有效的从可再生资源生产有价值化学品的新途径，尤其是用于制造在石油化工行业至关重要的乙二醇。
