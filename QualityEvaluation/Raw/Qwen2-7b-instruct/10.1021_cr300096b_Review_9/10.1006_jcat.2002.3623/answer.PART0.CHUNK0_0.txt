[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre-treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."
[2] "The addition of Pt to an Fe catalyst can alter the reaction pathway from one involving surface acetate species to one having acyl surface species as the principal active intermediate."
[3] "A model was proposed which described these titration results and allowed an estimation of the number of surface Pt and Fe atoms in the bimetallic particles dispersed on SiO2."
[4] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre-treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."

1. The incorporation of Pt into Fe catalysts forms bimetallic PtFe particles that improve the reducibility of iron during pretreatment, boost activity, eliminate the induction period, reduce the apparent activation energy, and maintain a high selectivity towards acetaldehyde, especially in catalysts with a low Pt/Fe ratio.

2. The introduction of Pt into an Fe catalyst modifies the reaction pathway from one involving surface acetate species to one featuring acyl surface species as the primary active intermediate.

3. A model was formulated to interpret these titration outcomes and estimate the number of surface Pt and Fe atoms in the bimetallic particles distributed on SiO2.

4. The inclusion of Pt in an Fe catalyst enhances the reducibility of iron during pretreatment, boosts activity, eradicates the induction period, lowers the apparent activation energy, and sustains a high selectivity for acetaldehyde, particularly in catalysts with a low Pt/Fe ratio.

1. 将Pt融入到Fe催化剂中形成的双金属PtFe颗粒在预处理过程中提高了铁的可还原性，增强了活性，消除了诱导期，降低了显热活化能，并且在低Pt/Fe比的催化剂中保持了高乙醛选择性。

2. 将Pt引入到Fe催化剂中改变了反应途径，从表面乙酸盐物种参与的途径转变为表面酰基物种作为主要活性中间体的途径。

3. 提出了一个模型来描述这些滴定结果并估算在SiO2上分散的双金属粒子中的表面Pt和Fe原子数量。

4. 在Fe催化剂中加入Pt可以提高铁的预处理过程中的可还原性，增强活性，消除诱导期，降低显热活化能，并且在低Pt/Fe比的催化剂中保持了高乙醛选择性。
