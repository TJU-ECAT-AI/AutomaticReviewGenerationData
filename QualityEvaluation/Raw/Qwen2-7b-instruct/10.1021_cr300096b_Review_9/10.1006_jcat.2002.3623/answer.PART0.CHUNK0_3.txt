[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre- treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction pe- riod, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet main- tained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."
[2] "It is proposed that acetic acid reduction with H2 over bimetallic PtFe catalysts occurs via a rate-determining sur- face reaction between a hydrogen atom and surface acyl species, and the kinetics can be described by a rate expres- sion derived from a LangmuirHinshelwood-type model invoking hydrogen dissociation on Pt sites and acetic acid adsorption and activation on an FeO phase to create the surface acyl species."

1. The addition of platinum (Pt) to iron (Fe) to create bimetallic PtFe catalysts improves several key aspects of the hydrogenation process, including enhancing the reducibility of iron, eliminating an induction period, reducing the apparent activation energy, and maintaining high selectivity for the formation of acetaldehyde, especially when the Pt/Fe ratio is low.

2. The reduction of acetic acid by hydrogen over bimetallic PtFe catalysts is proposed to occur through a rate-determining surface reaction between a hydrogen atom and an acyl species on the surface. The kinetics of this process can be modeled using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood-type expression, which accounts for hydrogen dissociation on Pt sites and acetic acid activation on an FeO phase to generate the acyl species.

1. 添加铂（Pt）到铁（Fe）以形成双金属PtFe催化剂可以提高氢化过程中的几个关键方面，包括增强铁的可还原性、消除诱导期、降低表观活化能，并且在低Pt/Fe比率的情况下保持高乙酸醛选择性。

2. 在双金属PtFe催化剂上通过氢还原乙酸的过程被提出是通过表面反应进行的，该反应涉及氢原子与表面的酰基物种。该过程的热力学可以通过Langmuir-Hinshelwood型表达式来建模，该表达式考虑了在Pt位点上的氢解离和在FeO相上激活乙酸，从而产生表面酰基物种。
