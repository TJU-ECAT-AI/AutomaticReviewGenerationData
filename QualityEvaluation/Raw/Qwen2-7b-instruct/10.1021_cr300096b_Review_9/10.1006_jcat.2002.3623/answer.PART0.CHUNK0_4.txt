[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre- treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction pe- riod, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet main- tained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."
[2] "The addition of Pt to an Fe catalyst can alter the reaction pathway from one involving surface acetate species to one having acyl surface species as the principal active intermediate."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. These include the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. The methodologies employed involve both theoretical analysis and experimental optimization to study, enhance, and refine the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

The addition of Pt to Fe catalysts forms bimetallic PtFe particles. This modification increases the reducibility of iron, boosts activity, eliminates the induction period, reduces the apparent activation energy, and maintains a high selectivity for acetaldehyde production. Particularly with catalysts that have a low Pt/Fe ratio, the selectivity towards acetaldehyde is enhanced. Moreover, the introduction of Pt alters the reaction pathway, making acyl surface species the primary active intermediate rather than surface acetate species.

使用铂-镍等双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化，在工业和研究领域有着重要的应用，包括精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化。采用理论分析与实验优化的方法，研究、改进和提升氢化过程的选择性和效率是主要手段。

向铁催化剂中添加铂形成双金属铂铁颗粒。这会增加铁的可还原性，提高活性，消除诱导期，降低表观活化能，并在低铂/铁比的催化剂中保持高乙醛选择性。特别是对于低铂/铁比的催化剂，乙醛的选择性得到增强。此外，铂的引入改变了反应途径，使表面酰基物种成为主要活性中间体，而非表面乙酸酯物种。
