[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre-treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."
[2] "The addition of Pt to an Fe catalyst can alter the reaction pathway from one involving surface acetate species to one having acyl surface species as the principal active intermediate."
[3] "The model correlated the experimental data very satisfactorily, and the enthalpy and entropy of adsorption for acetic acid and hydrogen on Pt obtained from the fitted parameters are thermodynamically consistent."
[4] "The fact that a PtFe catalyst has a much higher activity for acetic acid reduction by H2 than a monometallic Fe catalyst with a higher Fe loading indicates that the addition of Pt increases activity."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially through the use of bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, significantly contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes allow for the efficient conversion of organic compounds, leading to the production of valuable chemicals and fuels. The methodologies employed involve both theoretical studies and experimental validations to optimize and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the process.

For instance, the addition of platinum (Pt) to iron (Fe) to form bimetallic PtFe particles increases the reducibility of iron during the reduction pretreatment, enhancing the overall catalytic activity. This improvement eliminates the induction period, lowers the apparent activation energy, and maintains a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, especially in catalysts with a low Pt/Fe ratio. The selectivity is attributed to the altered reaction pathway, which now involves acyl surface species as the principal active intermediate, instead of surface acetate species as observed in monometallic catalysts.

The thermodynamic consistency of the enthalpy and entropy of adsorption for acetic acid and hydrogen on Pt, obtained from the fitted parameters of the kinetic model, further validates the effectiveness of this approach. The model successfully correlates with the experimental data, suggesting that the addition of Pt to an Fe catalyst can significantly alter the reaction pathway, leading to improved catalytic performance.

Moreover, the high activity of PtFe catalysts in acetic acid reduction demonstrates that the incorporation of Pt enhances the activity of the catalyst compared to monometallic Fe catalysts, even with a higher loading of Fe. This enhancement in activity is crucial for industrial applications, as it leads to more efficient and cost-effective chemical processes.

例如，通过铂（Pt）和铁（Fe）形成双金属PtFe粒子，增加了铁在还原预处理期间的可还原性，从而提高了整体催化活性。这种改进消除了诱导期，降低了显热能，同时保持了高选择性到乙醛醇，尤其是在Pt/Fe比例较低的催化剂中。选择性归因于反应途径的变化，现在涉及作为主要活性中间体的酰基表面物种，而不是单金属催化剂中观察到的表面乙酸酯物种。

从拟合参数得到的动态模型中，获得的乙酸和氢在Pt上的吸附焓和熵的一致热力学一致性进一步验证了这种方法的有效性。该模型成功地与实验数据相关联，表明将Pt添加到Fe催化剂中可以显著改变反应途径，从而提高催化性能。

此外，PtFe催化剂在乙酸氢化中的高活性证明了Pt的引入提高了催化剂的活性，即使Fe的负载更高也是如此。这种活性的增强对于工业应用至关重要，因为它导致更高效且成本效益更高的化学过程。
