[1] "The addition of Pt to Fe to form bimetallic PtFe particles increased the reducibility of iron during the reduction pre-treatment, enhanced activity, eliminated the induction period, lowered the apparent activation energy, and yet maintained a high selectivity to acetaldehyde, particularly with catalysts with low Pt/Fe ratios."

These quotes indicate that the addition of platinum (Pt) to iron (Fe) to form bimetallic PtFe catalysts leads to several advantageous properties. Specifically, the introduction of Pt increases the reducibility of Fe, boosts the activity of the catalyst, removes the induction period, reduces the apparent activation energy, and preserves a high selectivity towards acetaldehyde, especially in catalysts with a low Pt/Fe ratio.

这些引文表明，将铂（Pt）添加到铁（Fe）中形成双金属PtFe催化剂会带来一系列有利的特性。具体来说，引入Pt增加了Fe的可还原性，提高了催化剂的活性，消除了诱导期，降低了表观活化能，并保持了高选择性向乙醛，尤其是在Pt/Fe比例较低的催化剂中。
