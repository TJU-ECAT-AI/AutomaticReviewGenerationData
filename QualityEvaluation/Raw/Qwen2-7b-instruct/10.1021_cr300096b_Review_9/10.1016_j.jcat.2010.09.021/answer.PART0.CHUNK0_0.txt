[1] "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries."
[2] "Nevertheless, hydrogenation of CALD forms other by-products such as hydrocinnamaldehyde (HALD) and hydrocinnamal alcohol (HALC) due to the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of CC double bonds of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
[3] "Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD."
[4] "The catalytic performance of metallic nanoparticles may also be drastically changed by modifying the surface chemistry of the support, e.g., the activity of Pt nanoparticles was enhanced by a factor of 25 after removing the surface oxygen-containing groups from a carbon nanofiber (CNF) support."
[5] "Another promising approach to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles is to introduce a second metal (or metal oxide) to form bimetallic catalysts."
[6] "Recently, a novel preparation method, i.e., microwave-assisted polyol reduction (denoted as MAPR) technique has been proposed to synthesize Pt-based electro-catalysts for fuel cells."
[7] "In this contribution, we apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. This includes fine chemical synthesis, where selective hydrogenation enhances the yield and purity of desired products. In the context of cellulosic biomass conversion, these catalysts enable efficient conversion of biomass into valuable chemicals and biofuels, reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainability. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve a combination of theoretical calculations and experimental validation. Theoretical studies often utilize computational chemistry to predict the behavior of catalysts under various conditions. Experimentally, researchers use techniques like X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize catalysts and monitor the hydrogenation process. Competitive hydrogenations of toluene and benzene are also used to chemically probe the electron density of Pt nanoparticles, providing insights into the catalytic mechanism. Additionally, electrochemistry measurements, including cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping, are applied to identify the nature of the catalysts, further aiding in the optimization of the catalytic process.
