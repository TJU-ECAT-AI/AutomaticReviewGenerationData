<p>The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, hydrogenation of CALD forms other by-products such as hydrocinnamaldehyde (HALD) and hydrocinnamal alcohol (HALC) due to the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of CC double bonds of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.</p>
<p>Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD.</p>
<p>Recent studies have focused on the effects of supports and promoters on the activity and selectivity of Pt metallic nanoparticles in CALD selective hydrogenation.</p>
<p>Different support materials may lead to distinctive hydrogenation results due to the specific interactions between support and Pt nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of metallic nanoparticles may also be drastically changed by modifying the surface chemistry of the support, e.g., the activity of Pt nanoparticles was enhanced by a factor of 25 after removing the surface oxygen-containing groups from a carbon nanofiber (CNF) support.</p>
<p>Another promising approach to enhance the catalytic properties of Pt nanoparticles is to introduce a second metal (or metal oxide) to form bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>In this contribution, we apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method.</p>
<p>The effects on the catalytic performance of as-prepared bimetallic catalysts due to the pretreatment of multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) support surfaces, solvents and transition metal (metal oxide) promoters are examined.</p>
<p>Interestingly, other than generally adopted solvents such as alcohols and alkanes, the as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate as the solvent.</p>
<p>The selective hydrogenation of CALD was carried out in a stainless steel reactor with Teflon liner (Parr 4950, controller 4843).</p>
<p>The effect of stirring speed on CALD conversion was studied.</p>

1. Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion because it enables the selective transformation of organic compounds, producing valuable intermediates or final products. This process is optimized through various methodologies that include studying the effects of catalyst composition, support material, solvent choice, and promoter addition. These methodologies aim to enhance selectivity and efficiency by improving the interaction between the catalyst and reactants, facilitating faster and more controlled reactions.

2. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds across theoretical and experimental domains employs techniques like cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping to probe the electron density of Pt nanoparticles, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy for characterizing catalyst properties. Competitive hydrogenations of toluene and benzene are also utilized to chemically probe the nature of the catalysts. These methods collectively help in understanding the structure-reactivity relationships, identifying the active sites, and optimizing the catalyst design for better performance.
