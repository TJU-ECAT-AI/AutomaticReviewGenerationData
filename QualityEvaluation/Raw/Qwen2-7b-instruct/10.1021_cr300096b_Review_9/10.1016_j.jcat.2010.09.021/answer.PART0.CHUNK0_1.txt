<p>Nevertheless, hydrogenation of CALD forms other by-products such as hydrocinnamaldehyde (HALD) and hydrocinnamal alcohol (HALC) due to the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of CC double bonds of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes [2] ,[3] . In many cases, by-products such as acetals and other unidentified high molecular weight compounds may also be produced in large quantity [2] ,[4] .</p>
<p>Recent studies have focused on the effects of supports and promoters on the activity and selectivity of Pt metallic nanoparticles in CALD selective hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of metallic nanoparticles may also be drastically changed by modifying the surface chemistry of the support, e.g., the activity of Pt nanoparticles was enhanced by a factor of 25 after removing the surface oxygen-containing groups from a carbon nanofiber (CNF) support [8] .</p>
<p>In this contribution, we apply this facile MAPR method to prepare Pt-based bimetallic catalysts with high activity and selectivity for CALD hydrogenation, superior to those catalysts synthesized by the conventional IMP method.</p>
<p>Different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metalmetal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites.</p>
<p>The as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent.</p>

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. It enables the selective transformation of unsaturated aldehydes, like cinnamaldehyde, into desired alcohols with high efficiency and selectivity. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process encompass both theoretical modeling and experimental validation.

2. The effectiveness of catalysts in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde is influenced by multiple factors, including the support material, promoter selection, and preparation methods. Surface modifications, such as removing oxygen-containing groups from the support material, can significantly enhance catalyst activity. The use of bimetallic catalysts, which combine two metals, often leads to improved catalytic properties due to synergistic interactions between the metals. The microwave-assisted polyol reduction (MAPR) method has proven advantageous for synthesizing high-performance Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

3. The study demonstrated that the MAPR method outperforms traditional impregnation methods in terms of catalytic performance. This is attributed to the retention of hydrophobic surface properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the establishment of close contacts between the Pt active sites and promoters. These contacts facilitate electronic interactions that significantly boost the catalytic efficiency of the Pt nanoparticles.

4. Ethyl acetate emerged as an exceptional solvent for enhancing the catalytic activity and selectivity of the Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. This finding suggests that solvent choice plays a crucial role in optimizing the hydrogenation process and achieving high conversion rates while maintaining selectivity towards the desired product.
