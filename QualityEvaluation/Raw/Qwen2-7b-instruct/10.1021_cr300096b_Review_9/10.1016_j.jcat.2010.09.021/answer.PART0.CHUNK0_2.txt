[1] "Selective hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds is of paramount importance in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries."
[2] "Nevertheless, hydrogenation of CALD forms other by-products such as hydrocinnamaldehyde (HALD) and hydrocinnamal alcohol (HALC) due to the thermodynamically favorable hydrogenation of CC double bonds of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes."
[3] "Supported platinum nanoparticles have been extensively investigated and appear to be the most effective catalysts for the selective hydrogenation of CALD."
[4] "In many cases, by-products such as acetals and other unidentified high molecular weight compounds may also be produced in large quantity."
[5] "It is revealed that different from IMP method, MAPR retains the hydrophobic surface properties of CNT and affords close contact between promoters and Pt nanoparticles, e.g., metal-metal electronic interaction, which significantly improves the catalytic performance of Pt active sites."
[6] "Interestingly, other than generally adopted solvents such as alcohols, the as-prepared catalysts in this study showed remarkably high activity and selectivity in the presence of ethyl acetate (EA) as the solvent."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. This includes fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. It enables the selective conversion of unsaturated carbonyl compounds into valuable products, reducing the formation of unwanted by-products. This process is crucial in pharmaceutical and fragrance industries where precise control over product purity is essential.

2. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve both theoretical and experimental domains. Theoretical methods might include computational chemistry simulations, such as density functional theory calculations, to predict and understand the reaction mechanisms. Experimentally, researchers use techniques like X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electrochemistry measurements to characterize the catalysts' structure and electronic properties. Competitive hydrogenations of toluene and benzene, as well as cyclic voltammetry and CO stripping, are also utilized to probe the electron density of Pt nanoparticles and assess the catalysts' performance.

1. 催化氢解C═O键，特别是铂-镍双金属催化剂的应用，对精细化学合成和木质素生物质转化等工业及研究领域具有重要意义。这使得不饱和羰基化合物的选择性转化为有价值的产品成为可能，从而减少了副产品的生成。这一过程对于制药和香料行业至关重要，因为它们需要精确控制产品的纯度。

2. 研究、优化并提高此过程的活性和选择性的方法涉及理论与实验两个领域。理论上，可以使用计算化学模拟（如密度泛函理论计算）来预测和理解反应机制。实验上，则利用技术如X射线衍射、X射线光电子能谱、透射电子显微镜和电化学测量来表征催化剂的结构和电子性质。竞争氢化苯甲酸和苯、以及循环伏安法和CO脱附测试也被用来探测铂纳米颗粒的电子密度和评估催化剂的性能。
