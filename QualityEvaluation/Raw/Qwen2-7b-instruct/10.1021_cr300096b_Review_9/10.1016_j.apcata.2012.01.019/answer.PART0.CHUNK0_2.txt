<p>Hydrogenation of CO and CC bonds in cinnamaldehyde was evaluated over SiO2 supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic and Co, Cu, Pt monometallic catalysts in a batch reactor.</p>
<p>The reactor evaluation results show that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and Co-Pt shows much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation than Cu-Pt.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on bimetallic catalysts, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been performed by adding a 3d-metal, such as Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, to Pt(1 1 1).</p>
<p>The current work demonstrates a similar trend between model surfaces and supported catalysts, suggesting the possibility of using the relevant surface science results to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation.</p>

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts contributes to various industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Studies employ methodologies like H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), pulse CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to understand the catalytic behavior and bimetallic effects. These techniques allow for the optimization of selectivity and efficiency by examining factors such as reaction conditions, electronic and geometric structures of metal catalysts, catalyst supports, and preparation/activation procedures. The results from the studies demonstrate enhanced hydrogenation activity and selective CO bond hydrogenation over bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic catalysts. The findings suggest the potential use of surface science results to design efficient bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation processes.
