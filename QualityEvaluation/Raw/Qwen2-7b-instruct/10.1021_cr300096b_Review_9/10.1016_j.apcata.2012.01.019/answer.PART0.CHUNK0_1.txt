<p>More recently, these surface science results have been extended to γ-Al2O3 supported Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts, which exhibit significantly higher activity than monometallic Co and Pt catalysts for the hydrogenation of CO bonds in two probe molecules, acetone and acetaldehyde [23]. In the current work we extended the hydrogenation of monocarbonyl compounds to that of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on silica supported Co-Pt bimetallic catalysts.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity and selectivity are influenced by several factors, including reaction conditions and operation mode (e.g. gas or liquid phase hydrogenation), electronic and geometric structures of the metal catalysts, type of catalyst supports, and catalyst preparation and activation procedures.</p>
<p>The current work demonstrates a similar trend between model surfaces and supported catalysts, suggesting the possibility of using the relevant surface science results to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation.</p>

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains include the use of surface science results to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation. This involves understanding the electronic and geometric structures of metal catalysts, the type of catalyst supports, and the catalyst preparation and activation procedures. These factors influence the catalytic activity and selectivity, and by studying model surfaces and extending the findings to supported catalysts, researchers can apply surface science insights to improve hydrogenation processes.
