[1] "Selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to the corresponding allylic alcohols has received considerable attention because of its industrial applications [1] ,[2] ,[3] ."
[2] "The catalytic activity and selectivity are influenced by several factors, including reaction conditions and operation mode (e.g. gas or liquid phase hydrogenation), electronic and geometric structures of the metal catalysts, type of catalyst supports, and catalyst preparation and activation procedures."
[3] "The results presented above demonstrate that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, with Co-Pt showing much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation and Cu-Pt being more highly selective toward CC bond hydrogenation."
[4] "This weak interaction between the surface and the adsorbates allows for novel, low-temperature hydrogenation to occur."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling the selective transformation of substrates into valuable products. This process is optimized and enhanced across theoretical and experimental domains through methodologies that include studying the electronic and geometric structures of metal catalysts, understanding the influence of reaction conditions, and characterizing catalyst supports and preparation techniques. 

2. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process involve a range of approaches, such as examining the reduction behavior of catalysts through H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), assessing the number of active sites on the catalyst surface via pulse CO chemisorption, characterizing the metallic particle size distribution and bimetallic effects with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and analyzing local structural information using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements. These studies aim to gain insights into the catalytic behavior and bimetallic effects, facilitating the design of efficient catalysts.

3. The literature demonstrates that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit significantly higher hydrogenation activity than their monometallic counterparts. Specifically, Co-Pt catalysts show much higher selectivity towards the hydrogenation of C═O bonds, while Cu-Pt catalysts preferentially hydrogenate CC bonds. This trend aligns with previous surface science studies on the hydrogenation of acrolein, highlighting the potential of bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation processes.

4. The weak interaction between the surface of the catalyst and the adsorbates allows for novel, low-temperature hydrogenation reactions to occur, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity of bimetallic systems. This phenomenon is supported by both theoretical calculations and experimental evidence, which suggest that the presence of Pt-terminated bimetallic structures is responsible for the observed hydrogenation activity.

5. The enhanced hydrogenation activity observed over Co-Pt/SiO2 catalysts compared to Cu-Pt/SiO2 catalysts is attributed to the higher selectivity toward the CO bond hydrogenation in Co-Pt/SiO2. This selectivity trend is consistent with surface science studies on the hydrogenation of acrolein, indicating a similarity between model surfaces and supported catalysts in their behavior towards hydrogenation reactions.

6. The possibility of using relevant surface science results to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation processes is suggested by the alignment between the catalytic behavior of model surfaces and supported catalysts. This approach offers a promising avenue for optimizing catalyst design and enhancing the efficiency of hydrogenation reactions in industrial and research applications.

4. 表面与吸附剂之间的弱相互作用允许在较低温度下发生新颖的氢化反应，这有助于双金属系统的增强催化活性。这一现象由理论计算和实验证据支持，表明Pt终止的双金属结构的存在是观察到的氢化活性的原因。

5. 与Cu-Pt/SiO2催化剂相比，Co-Pt/SiO2催化剂显示出更高的CO键氢化选择性，这是由于在Co-Pt/SiO2催化剂中观察到的CO键氢化活性较高。这种选择性趋势与关于acrolein氢化的表面科学研究一致，表明模型表面和支撑催化剂之间行为的相似性。
