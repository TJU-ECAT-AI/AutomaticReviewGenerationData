<p>Hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde was evaluated over SiO2 supported Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic and Co, Cu, Pt monometallic catalysts in a batch reactor.</p>
<p>The reactor evaluation results show that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and Co-Pt shows much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation than Cu-Pt.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the hydrogenation pathways of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes on bimetallic catalysts, fundamental studies on Pt single crystal and Pt-based bimetallic surfaces have been performed by adding a 3d-metal, such as Fe, Co, Ni and Cu, to Pt(1 1 1).</p>
<p>The results presented above demonstrate that Co-Pt and Cu-Pt bimetallic catalysts exhibit much higher hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, with Co-Pt showing much higher selectivity toward CO bond hydrogenation and Cu-Pt being more highly selective toward CC bond hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The current work demonstrates a similar trend between model surfaces and supported catalysts, suggesting the possibility of using the relevant surface science results to design bimetallic catalysts for selective hydrogenation.</p>

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Co-Pt and Cu-Pt systems contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts enable the selective hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, producing desired products like cinnamyl alcohol. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), pulse CO chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). These techniques provide insights into the catalytic behavior and bimetallic effects, allowing for the design of bimetallic catalysts based on surface science results that can selectively hydrogenate CO bonds over CC bonds, thereby enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of the hydrogenation process.
