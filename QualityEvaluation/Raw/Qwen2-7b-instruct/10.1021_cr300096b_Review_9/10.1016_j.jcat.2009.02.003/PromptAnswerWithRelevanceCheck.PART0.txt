[2] "Detailed EXAFS, TEM-EDX and XPS studies showed that reductive deposition precipitation resulted in a close contact of tin with platinum."
[3] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst and a bimetallic catalyst prepared by impregnation in which such a close interaction was absent."
[4] "The general applicability of reductive deposition precipitation as synthesis technique was demonstrated using tin and gallium as promoters."
[5] "The challenge is to increase the selectivity of these Pt/CNF catalysts while maintaining a high activity."
[6] "Addition of a promoter metal(oxide) to CNF supported platinum catalysts is a promising route, since successful promotion of platinum based catalysts by tin, germanium, gallium or iron has been reported."
[7] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[8] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."
[9] "The number of accessible available platinum sites was determined using hydrogen chemisorption."
[10] "The hydrogen chemisorption results are also summarized in Table 3 and expressed as H/Pt ratio."
[11] "In general an increasing intended tin-loading resulted in a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP prepared samples."
[12] "This suggests that upon deposition of higher concentrations of promoter, a lower amount of hydrogenation sites is available on the catalysts, which can be ascribed to an increased coverage of platinum by tin."

[C1] "In literature, it has been reported that higher CALD concentrations resulted in a higher selectivity."
[C2] "It has also been reported that higher hydrogenation pressures can result in a lower selectivity compared to lower hydrogen pressures."
[C3] "Since in this study the hydrogenation pressure was increased and the CALD concentration was decreased at the same time when going from the low to the high pressure experiments, a combination of these two factors might have resulted in the observed decrease in absolute selectivities at high pressure."
[C4] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

1. The addition of promoter salts during hydrogenation was common practice, but making the promoter part of the catalyst was considered more convenient. Reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) was one technique that could be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, demonstrating its potential for catalytic performance.

2. Detailed characterization of the interaction between platinum and tin was insufficient, highlighting the need for further investigation. Bimetallic Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared using RDP, which led to a close contact of tin with platinum.

3. Catalysts with a close contact between platinum and promoter showed improved selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol. However, conclusions regarding activity could not be clearly drawn due to the influence of various reaction conditions like pressure and reactant concentration.

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, are used in various industrial processes such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. They are crucial because they enable selective hydrogenation of C═O bonds, producing valuable chemicals like alcohols from aldehydes. 

2. Researchers employ methodologies like EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), TEM-EDX (Transmission Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), and XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) to study the structure of these catalysts. These techniques help understand how the metals interact and influence the catalytic activity.

3. Catalysts prepared through reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) showed improved selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde towards cinnamyl alcohol. This is attributed to the close contact between platinum and the promoter metal, likely due to the RDP technique.

4. The activity of these catalysts isn't solely dependent on the presence of the promoter. Factors like pressure, reactant concentration, and possibly the size of the metal particles also play significant roles. The selectivity, however, seems to be more directly influenced by the promoter-metal interaction.

<p>It has been reported before that the addition of a second metal can result an increasing as well as a decreasing activity [5] ,[34] ,[38] . Increased activities have been ascribed to the presence of ionic promoters directing the CO bond towards the platinum, thereby enhancing both selectivity and activity. Decreased activities have been ascribed to the presence of high promoter concentrations resulting in a dramatically decreasing hydrogenation capacity [5] . Our results suggest that the optimum activity does not depend on a particular amount of promoter only, but may shift due to application of different test conditions as well.</p>

1. The addition of a second metal to a catalyst can result in either increased or decreased activity. Increased activity can be attributed to the presence of ionic promoters that direct the CO bond towards the platinum, enhancing both selectivity and activity. Decreased activity is often due to high promoter concentrations leading to a significant drop in hydrogenation capacity. The study suggests that the optimal activity isn't solely dependent on the amount of promoter but can shift based on different test conditions.
2. The reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) synthesis method results in a close interaction between tin and platinum, forming a bimetallic system. This leads to an increased selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol, regardless of the applied hydrogenation pressure.

1. 添加第二金属到催化剂中可能导致活性增加或减少。活性增加可以归因于离子促进剂的存在，它们将CO键导向铂，从而增强选择性和活性。活性降低通常归因于高促进剂浓度导致氢化能力大幅下降。研究表明，最佳活性不仅依赖于促进剂的量，还可能根据不同的测试条件而变化。
2. 减少沉积预处理（RDP）合成方法导致锡和铂之间形成紧密相互作用，形成双金属体系。这导致在不同氢化压力下，对肉桂醛氢化产生更高选择性，转化为肉桂醇。
