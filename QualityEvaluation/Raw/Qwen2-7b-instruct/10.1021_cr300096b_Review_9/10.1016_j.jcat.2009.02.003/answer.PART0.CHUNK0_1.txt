[C1] "In literature, it has been reported that higher CALD concentrations resulted in a higher selectivity."
[C2] "It has also been reported that higher hydrogenation pressures can result in a lower selectivity compared to lower hydrogen pressures."
[C3] "Since in this study the hydrogenation pressure was increased and the CALD concentration was decreased at the same time when going from the low to the high pressure experiments, a combination of these two factors might have resulted in the observed decrease in absolute selectivities at high pressure."
[C4] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling the selective conversion of functionalized molecules. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include detailed characterizations through techniques like EXAFS, TEM-EDX, XPS, and hydrogen chemisorption. These studies aim to understand the interaction between the metals, the structure of the catalyst, and how these factors influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. 

2. The methodologies used to study the hydrogenation process include detailed characterization techniques such as EXAFS, TEM-EDX, XPS, and hydrogen chemisorption. These methods allow researchers to understand the interaction between the metals, the structure of the catalyst, and how these factors influence the catalytic activity and selectivity. 

3. The decrease in absolute selectivities at high pressure can be attributed to a combination of factors, including an increase in hydrogenation pressure and a decrease in the concentration of the compound being hydrogenated (CALD). 

4. The selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process are primarily influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration. The presence of a particular amount of promoter does not solely determine the optimum activity, but rather, the behavior can shift due to changes in test conditions.
