[1] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques."
[2] "The general applicability of reductive deposition precipitation as synthesis technique was demonstrated using tin and gallium as promoters."
[3] "Catalysts which displayed a close and significant contact between platinum and promoter were more selective in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the samples in which such an interaction is not present."
[4] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, particularly those containing platinum, are used in various industrial processes such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. They are crucial because they enable selective hydrogenation of C═O bonds, producing valuable chemicals like alcohols from aldehydes. 

2. Researchers employ methodologies like EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), TEM-EDX (Transmission Electron Microscopy - Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy), and XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) to study the structure of these catalysts. These techniques help understand how the metals interact and influence the catalytic activity.

3. Catalysts prepared through reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) showed improved selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde towards cinnamyl alcohol. This is attributed to the close contact between platinum and the promoter metal, likely due to the RDP technique.

4. The activity of these catalysts isn't solely dependent on the presence of the promoter. Factors like pressure, reactant concentration, and possibly the size of the metal particles also play significant roles. The selectivity, however, seems to be more directly influenced by the promoter-metal interaction.

1. 含铂的双金属催化剂在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业过程中起着关键作用。它们通过选择性氢化C═O键，将醛转化为有价值的化学物质如醇。

2. 研究人员使用EXAFS（扩展X射线吸收精细结构）、TEM-EDX（透射电子显微镜-能量色散X射线光谱）和XPS（X射线光电子能谱）等方法研究这些催化剂。这些技术有助于理解金属之间的相互作用及其对催化活性的影响。

3. 通过还原沉积沉淀法(RDP)制备的催化剂在苯甲醛氢化为苯醇时显示出增强的选择性。这归因于铂与促进剂金属之间紧密的接触，可能是由于RDP技术。

4. 这些催化剂的活性并不完全取决于促进剂的存在。压力、反应物浓度等因素也起着重要作用。然而，选择性似乎更直接地受到促进剂-金属相互作用的影响。
