<p>It has been reported before that the addition of a second metal can result an increasing as well as a decreasing activity [5] ,[34] ,[38] . Increased activities have been ascribed to the presence of ionic promoters directing the CO bond towards the platinum, thereby enhancing both selectivity and activity. Decreased activities have been ascribed to the presence of high promoter concentrations resulting in a dramatically decreasing hydrogenation capacity [5] . Our results suggest that the optimum activity does not depend on a particular amount of promoter only, but may shift due to application of different test conditions as well.</p>
<p>The RDP synthesis results in close contact of tin with platinum, thereby forming a close interaction of the two metals. This results in a higher selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol for the cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation, irrespective the applied hydrogenation pressure.</p>

1. The addition of a second metal to a catalyst can result in either increased or decreased activity. Increased activity can be attributed to the presence of ionic promoters that direct the CO bond towards the platinum, enhancing both selectivity and activity. Decreased activity is often due to high promoter concentrations leading to a significant drop in hydrogenation capacity. The study suggests that the optimal activity isn't solely dependent on the amount of promoter but can shift based on different test conditions.
2. The reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) synthesis method results in a close interaction between tin and platinum, forming a bimetallic system. This leads to an increased selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol, regardless of the applied hydrogenation pressure.

1. 添加第二金属到催化剂中可能导致活性增加或减少。活性增加可以归因于离子促进剂的存在，它们将CO键导向铂，从而增强选择性和活性。活性降低通常归因于高促进剂浓度导致氢化能力大幅下降。研究表明，最佳活性不仅依赖于促进剂的量，还可能根据不同的测试条件而变化。
2. 减少沉积预处理（RDP）合成方法导致锡和铂之间形成紧密相互作用，形成双金属体系。这导致在不同氢化压力下，对肉桂醛氢化产生更高选择性，转化为肉桂醇。
