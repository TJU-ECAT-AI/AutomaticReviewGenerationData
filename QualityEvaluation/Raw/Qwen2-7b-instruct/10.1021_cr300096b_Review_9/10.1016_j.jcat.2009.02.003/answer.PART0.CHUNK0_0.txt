[1] "In this study, tin and gallium promoted Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared by reductive deposition precipitation (RDP, i.e. deposition under hydrogen atmosphere) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI)."
[2] "Detailed EXAFS, TEM-EDX and XPS studies showed that reductive deposition precipitation resulted in a close contact of tin with platinum."
[3] "These bimetallic catalysts displayed an improved selectivity for cinnamaldehyde hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol as compared to the monometallic platinum catalyst and a bimetallic catalyst prepared by impregnation in which such a close interaction was absent."
[4] "The general applicability of reductive deposition precipitation as synthesis technique was demonstrated using tin and gallium as promoters."
[5] "The challenge is to increase the selectivity of these Pt/CNF catalysts while maintaining a high activity."
[6] "Addition of a promoter metal(oxide) to CNF supported platinum catalysts is a promising route, since successful promotion of platinum based catalysts by tin, germanium, gallium or iron has been reported."
[7] "The majority of these bimetallic catalysts are prepared using impregnation techniques. Unfortunately, this technique does not necessarily result in a close contact of the two metals, which is assumed to be of importance."
[8] "To achieve this high activity, it was crucial to remove the majority of the oxygen surface groups from the CNF catalysts."
[9] "The number of accessible available platinum sites was determined using hydrogen chemisorption."
[10] "The hydrogen chemisorption results are also summarized in Table 3 and expressed as H/Pt ratio."
[11] "In general an increasing intended tin-loading resulted in a lower H/Pt ratio for the RDP prepared samples."
[12] "This suggests that upon deposition of higher concentrations of promoter, a lower amount of hydrogenation sites is available on the catalysts, which can be ascribed to an increased coverage of platinum by tin."
[13] "The general applicability of reductive deposition precipitation as synthesis technique was demonstrated using tin and gallium as promoters."
[14] "For activity such a clear conclusion could not be drawn since activity is mainly influenced by the reaction conditions, such as pressure and reactant concentration."

1. Bimetallic catalysts, specifically Pt-Ni systems, contribute to industrial applications like fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by improving selectivity and efficiency in hydrogenation processes. The methodology involves studying, optimizing, and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency through experimental and theoretical approaches.

2. Reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) and incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) are employed to prepare bimetallic Pt/CNF catalysts. RDP under hydrogen atmosphere results in a close contact between tin and platinum, leading to improved selectivity in hydrogenation reactions.

3. The selectivity of hydrogenation towards the desired cinnamyl alcohol is enhanced by RDP-prepared bimetallic catalysts compared to monometallic Pt catalysts and those prepared by impregnation without close metal interaction.

4. The close contact of tin with platinum obtained through RDP enhances the selectivity of the catalysts for hydrogenation reactions.

5. The selectivity of Pt/CNF catalysts can be increased by adding promoter metals like tin, germanium, gallium, or iron, improving the overall catalytic activity.

6. Impregnation techniques commonly used for preparing bimetallic catalysts do not necessarily ensure a close contact between metals, which is crucial for enhancing catalytic properties.

7. Removing the majority of oxygen surface groups from CNF catalysts is essential to achieve high activity in hydrogenation reactions.

8. Hydrogen chemisorption is utilized to determine the number of accessible platinum sites on the catalyst surface, providing insight into the catalyst's activity.

9. An increase in tin loading in RDP-prepared catalysts results in a decrease in the hydrogenation site availability, attributed to an increased coverage of platinum by tin.

10. Reductive deposition precipitation is a versatile technique that can be used to synthesize bimetallic catalysts with desirable properties for various applications.

11. The selectivity of Pt/CNF catalysts for hydrogenation reactions cannot be solely attributed to the amount of promoter added, as it depends on reaction conditions like pressure and reactant concentration.
