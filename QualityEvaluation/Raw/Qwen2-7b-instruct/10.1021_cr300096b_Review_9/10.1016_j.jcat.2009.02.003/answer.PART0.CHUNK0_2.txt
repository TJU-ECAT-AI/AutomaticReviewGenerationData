1. The addition of promoter salts during hydrogenation was common practice, but making the promoter part of the catalyst was considered more convenient. Reductive deposition precipitation (RDP) was one technique that could be performed below the equilibrium potential of the redox reaction, demonstrating its potential for catalytic performance.

2. Detailed characterization of the interaction between platinum and tin was insufficient, highlighting the need for further investigation. Bimetallic Pt/CNF catalysts were prepared using RDP, which led to a close contact of tin with platinum.

3. Catalysts with a close contact between platinum and promoter showed improved selectivity in the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde to cinnamyl alcohol. However, conclusions regarding activity could not be clearly drawn due to the influence of various reaction conditions like pressure and reactant concentration.

1. 在早期研究中，促进剂盐通常在氢化过程中添加到反应器中。但将促进剂作为催化剂的一部分更为方便。当红还沉积沉淀（RDP）可以执行在还原反应的电位平衡以下时，展示了其催化性能的潜力。

2. 对铂和锡之间的相互作用的详细表征不足，表明需要进一步研究。通过RDP制备了双金属Pt/CNF催化剂，这导致了锡与铂之间的紧密接触。

3. 具有铂和促进剂之间紧密接触的催化剂在氢化肉桂醛到肉桂醇中的选择性有所提高。然而，由于压力和反应物浓度等反应条件的影响，关于活性的结论无法清楚地得出。
