Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon.
Conversely to massive CeO2, TPR profile of CeO2/C showed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K), which are indicative of the easier reduction of the supported promoter.
Addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, this indicating a close metal-promoter interaction.
Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition.
The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst.
After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity.
Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts, specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values.
Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart.
The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Sn systems, contributes significantly to industrial and research applications, especially in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the hydrogenation process through specific interactions between metals and promoters. The impregnation method leads to a highly dispersed ceria on carbon, which facilitates easier reduction compared to massive CeO2. Platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, indicating a close interaction between metals and promoters. Tin addition increases ceria reducibility. The reduction treatment at 773 K results in a decrease in CO adsorption capacity, affecting the catalyst activity differently for monometallic versus bimetallic catalysts. Monometallic catalysts show higher activity after reduction at lower temperatures, whereas bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25, demonstrate increased citral conversion and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction explains the enhanced activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

使用如Pt-Sn这样的双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化，在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域具有重要贡献。这些催化剂通过金属与促进剂之间的特定相互作用，提高了氢化过程的效率和选择性。浸渍方法导致碳上高度分散的铈，这使得其在低温下更容易还原，相比大量的CeO2。铂部分促进了表面铈的还原，表明金属与促进剂之间有紧密的相互作用。锡的添加增加了铈的可还原性。在773 K下的还原处理导致CO吸附能力的下降，对单金属催化剂和双金属催化剂的影响不同。在较低温度下还原后的单金属催化剂表现出更高的活性，而特定Sn/Pt比例为0.25的双金属催化剂则显示出增加的异构醇转化率。还原过程后形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点解释了双金属催化剂的增强活性和选择性。
