[1] "A novel kind of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria were prepared by a co-impregnation method and tested in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral after reduction at low (473 K) and high (773 K) temperatures."
[2] "Results from N2 adsorption, XRD and TEM indicated that impregnation method used here led to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon."
[3] "Conversely to massive CeO2, TPR profile of CeO2/C showed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K), which are indicative of the easier reduction of the supported promoter."
[4] "Addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, this indicating a close metalpromoter interaction."
[5] "Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition."
[6] "The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst."
[7] "After reduction at low temperature (473 K), the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C was the most active catalyst, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity."
[8] "Reduction at high temperature (773 K) produced the decrease of activity in the case of monometallic sample while bimetallic catalysts, specially the one with Sn/Pt = 0.25, increased the citral conversion values."
[9] "Reduction treatment at 773 K also increased selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) of bimetallic samples, which presented in all cases higher values than their monometallic counterpart."
[10] "The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after the reduction process is proposed to explain the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts."

1. The research focuses on the development and application of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria for citral hydrogenation. These catalysts show enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts under different reduction temperatures.

2. The methodology involves the preparation of the catalysts through a co-impregnation method, followed by testing their performance in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts are characterized using techniques such as N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and CO chemisorption.

3. The results indicate that the impregnation method leads to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon, which facilitates easier reduction compared to bulk ceria. The addition of platinum promotes ceria reduction, suggesting a close interaction between the metals. Tin addition increases ceria reducibility.

4. The reduction treatment at 773 K results in a significant decrease in CO adsorption capacity, particularly for monometallic catalysts. However, this treatment enhances the activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts for the production of unsaturated alcohols.

5. The bimetallic catalysts with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25 exhibit increased citral conversion values and higher selectivity towards geraniol and nerol, compared to their monometallic counterparts.

6. The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after reduction is proposed as the reason for the improved activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

1. 研究关注了一种新型的PtSn双金属催化剂，该催化剂支持在碳上并以高度分散的氧化铈为促进剂，用于柠檬醛的氢化反应。这些催化剂在不同的还原温度下显示出与单金属催化剂相比增强的活性和选择性。

2. 方法包括通过共浸渍法制备催化剂，然后测试其在液相氢化柠檬醛中的性能。催化剂通过氮气吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序化还原（TPR）和CO化学吸附等技术进行表征。

3. 结果表明，浸渍方法导致了碳上的高度分散的氧化铈，这使得氧化铈更容易还原，相比块状氧化铈。铂的添加促进了氧化铈的还原，暗示了金属之间紧密的相互作用。锡的添加增加了氧化铈的可还原性。

4. 在773 K下的还原处理导致了显著的CO吸附能力下降，特别是对于单金属催化剂。然而，这种处理增强了双金属催化剂对不饱和醇的活性和选择性。

5. Sn/Pt比例为0.25的双金属催化剂表现出比其单金属对应物更高的柠檬醛转化值和更高地向geraniol和nerol的选择性。

6. 提议在还原过程中新生成的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点是双金属催化剂提高活性和选择性的原因。
