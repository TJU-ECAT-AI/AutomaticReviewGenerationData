[3] "Conversely to massive CeO2, TPR profile of CeO2/C showed two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures (803 and 903 K), which are indicative of the easier reduction of the supported promoter."
[4] "Addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, this indicating a close metalpromoter interaction."
[5] "Ceria reducibility was increased with tin addition."
[6] "The reduction treatment at 773 K produced a strong decrease in the CO adsorption capacity in all cases, although this loss was more relevant for the monometallic catalyst."

1. The research focuses on the development and application of bimetallic PtSn catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria for citral hydrogenation. These catalysts show enhanced activity and selectivity compared to monometallic catalysts under different reduction temperatures.

2. The methodology involves the preparation of the catalysts through a co-impregnation method, followed by testing their performance in the liquid phase hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts are characterized using techniques such as N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and CO chemisorption.

3. The results indicate that the impregnation method leads to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon, which facilitates easier reduction compared to bulk ceria. The addition of platinum promotes ceria reduction, suggesting a close interaction between the metals. Tin addition increases ceria reducibility.

4. The reduction treatment at 773 K results in a significant decrease in CO adsorption capacity, particularly for monometallic catalysts. However, this treatment enhances the activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts for the production of unsaturated alcohols.

5. The bimetallic catalysts with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25 exhibit increased citral conversion values and higher selectivity towards geraniol and nerol, compared to their monometallic counterparts.

6. The onset of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after reduction is proposed as the reason for the improved activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

1. 研究关注了一种新型的PtSn双金属催化剂，该催化剂支持在碳上并以高度分散的氧化铈为促进剂，用于柠檬醛的氢化反应。这些催化剂在不同的还原温度下显示出与单金属催化剂相比增强的活性和选择性。

2. 方法包括通过共浸渍法制备催化剂，然后测试其在液相氢化柠檬醛中的性能。催化剂通过氮气吸附、X射线衍射（XRD）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）、温度程序化还原（TPR）和CO化学吸附等技术进行表征。

3. 结果表明，浸渍方法导致了碳上的高度分散的氧化铈，这使得氧化铈更容易还原，相比块状氧化铈。铂的添加促进了氧化铈的还原，暗示了金属之间紧密的相互作用。锡的添加增加了氧化铈的可还原性。

4. 在773 K下的还原处理导致了显著的CO吸附能力下降，特别是对于单金属催化剂。然而，这种处理增强了双金属催化剂对不饱和醇的活性和选择性。

5. Sn/Pt比例为0.25的双金属催化剂表现出比其单金属对应物更高的柠檬醛转化值和更高地向geraniol和nerol的选择性。

6. 提议在还原过程中新生成的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点是双金属催化剂提高活性和选择性的原因。

The study demonstrates that bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts supported on highly-dispersed ceria on carbon exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of citral compared to monometallic catalysts. The use of ceria as a promoter facilitates easier reduction of the surface ceria, and the addition of tin increases ceria reducibility. After reduction, the presence of tin in the catalyst leads to a decrease in activity for the monometallic Pt catalyst but increases the activity of the bimetallic Pt-Sn catalyst, especially when the Sn/Pt ratio is 0.25. This bimetallic catalyst also shows improved selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites after reduction is hypothesized to explain the increased activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts.

研究结果表明，含铂锡的双金属催化剂在碳上支持高度分散的氧化铈表现出与单一金属催化剂相比，增强的活性和选择性，在环己醇的氢化过程中。氧化铈作为促进剂，可以更容易地还原表面氧化铈，而添加锡则增加了氧化铈的可还原性。在还原处理后，对于单一金属铂催化剂而言，锡的存在导致其活性下降，但对于铂锡双金属催化剂，尤其是在Sn/Pt比为0.25的情况下，其活性增加。此外，该双金属催化剂对不饱和醇的选择性也有所提高。还原过程后形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点被推测解释了双金属催化剂的活性和选择性的增加。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems, contributes significantly to industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the efficient conversion of various organic compounds into valuable products. The methodologies employed involve a co-impregnation method to prepare catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria. These catalysts are characterized through techniques such as N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and CO chemisorption.

The results indicate that the impregnation method leads to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon. The TPR profile of CeO2/C shows two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures, suggesting easier reduction of the supported promoter. The addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, indicating a close interaction between metals and promoters. Ceria reducibility increases with the addition of tin. 

After reduction at low temperature, the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst was the most active, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity. At high temperature, the activity of monometallic samples decreased, whereas bimetallic catalysts, especially those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25, showed increased citral conversion values. Reduction treatment at high temperature also enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in bimetallic samples compared to their monometallic counterparts. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction explains the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

催化剂的制备和测试，以及随后在低温（473K）和高温（773K）下进行的氢化反应表明，使用如Pt-Sn这类双金属催化剂在工业应用中，尤其是精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化方面具有显著贡献。这种方法允许有效转换各种有机化合物为有价值的产物。所采用的方法包括共浸渍法来准备碳支持和高度分散氧化铈促进的催化剂。通过N2吸附、X射线衍射、温度程序还原（TPR）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和CO化学吸附等技术对这些催化剂进行表征。

结果表明，浸渍方法导致碳上的高度分散氧化铈。氧化铈/C的TPR图谱显示在低温下的两个重叠峰，这表明支持促进剂的更容易还原。铂的添加部分促进了表面氧化铈的还原，表明金属与促进剂之间有密切的相互作用。随着锡的添加，氧化铈的可还原性增加。

在低温下还原后，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂最为活跃，而锡的存在降低了催化活性。在高温下，单金属样品的活性降低，而双金属催化剂，特别是Sn/Pt比为0.25的催化剂，显示出较高的异构醇（香叶醇和芳樟醇）的转化值。高温还原处理也提高了双金属样品中不饱和醇的选择性，与单金属对应物相比，这些双金属样品中的选择性更高。还原过程后形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点解释了双金属催化剂活性和选择性的增加。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt-Sn systems, contributes significantly to industrial and research applications, especially in fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the hydrogenation process through specific interactions between metals and promoters. The impregnation method leads to a highly dispersed ceria on carbon, which facilitates easier reduction compared to massive CeO2. Platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, indicating a close interaction between metals and promoters. Tin addition increases ceria reducibility. The reduction treatment at 773 K results in a decrease in CO adsorption capacity, affecting the catalyst activity differently for monometallic versus bimetallic catalysts. Monometallic catalysts show higher activity after reduction at lower temperatures, whereas bimetallic catalysts, particularly those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25, demonstrate increased citral conversion and selectivity to unsaturated alcohols. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction explains the enhanced activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.
