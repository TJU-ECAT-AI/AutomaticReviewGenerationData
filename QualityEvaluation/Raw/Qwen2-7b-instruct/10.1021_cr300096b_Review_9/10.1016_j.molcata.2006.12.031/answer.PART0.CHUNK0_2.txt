The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Sn systems, contributes significantly to industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the efficient conversion of various organic compounds into valuable products. The methodologies employed involve a co-impregnation method to prepare catalysts supported on carbon and promoted with highly-dispersed ceria. These catalysts are characterized through techniques such as N2 adsorption, X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and CO chemisorption.

The results indicate that the impregnation method leads to a highly-dispersed ceria on carbon. The TPR profile of CeO2/C shows two broad overlapped peaks at low temperatures, suggesting easier reduction of the supported promoter. The addition of platinum partially promotes the reduction of surface ceria, indicating a close interaction between metals and promoters. Ceria reducibility increases with the addition of tin. 

After reduction at low temperature, the monometallic Pt/CeO2/C catalyst was the most active, while the presence of tin reduced the catalytic activity. At high temperature, the activity of monometallic samples decreased, whereas bimetallic catalysts, especially those with a Sn/Pt ratio of 0.25, showed increased citral conversion values. Reduction treatment at high temperature also enhanced the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (geraniol and nerol) in bimetallic samples compared to their monometallic counterparts. The formation of new PtCeOx and PtSnOx sites post-reduction explains the increase in activity and selectivity of bimetallic catalysts.

催化剂的制备和测试，以及随后在低温（473K）和高温（773K）下进行的氢化反应表明，使用如Pt-Sn这类双金属催化剂在工业应用中，尤其是精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化方面具有显著贡献。这种方法允许有效转换各种有机化合物为有价值的产物。所采用的方法包括共浸渍法来准备碳支持和高度分散氧化铈促进的催化剂。通过N2吸附、X射线衍射、温度程序还原（TPR）、透射电子显微镜（TEM）和CO化学吸附等技术对这些催化剂进行表征。

结果表明，浸渍方法导致碳上的高度分散氧化铈。氧化铈/C的TPR图谱显示在低温下的两个重叠峰，这表明支持促进剂的更容易还原。铂的添加部分促进了表面氧化铈的还原，表明金属与促进剂之间有密切的相互作用。随着锡的添加，氧化铈的可还原性增加。

在低温下还原后，单金属Pt/CeO2/C催化剂最为活跃，而锡的存在降低了催化活性。在高温下，单金属样品的活性降低，而双金属催化剂，特别是Sn/Pt比为0.25的催化剂，显示出较高的异构醇（香叶醇和芳樟醇）的转化值。高温还原处理也提高了双金属样品中不饱和醇的选择性，与单金属对应物相比，这些双金属样品中的选择性更高。还原过程后形成的新的PtCeOx和PtSnOx位点解释了双金属催化剂活性和选择性的增加。
