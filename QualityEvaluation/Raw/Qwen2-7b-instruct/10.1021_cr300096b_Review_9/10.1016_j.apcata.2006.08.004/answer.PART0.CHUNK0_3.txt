[1] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide, prepared by the catalytic reduction method, were reduced either at 300 C or at 500 C (SMSI effect)."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge systems supported on titania oxide, plays a significant role in various industrial and research applications. These applications encompass fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include both theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

1. The hydrogenation of citral, an α-,β-unsaturated aldehyde, is a prime example of where these catalysts find application. The selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols (UA) can be finely tuned by adjusting the germanium content in the bimetallic catalysts, regardless of the reduction temperature (300°C or 500°C).

2. When the reduction temperature is increased to 500°C, the catalysts can exhibit a higher UA selectivity compared to lower temperatures. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic and SMSI (Strong Metal-Support Interaction) effects. The presence of TiO(2x) species derived from the reducible titania support enhances the activation of the CO bond, contributing to the selectivity towards UA.

3. However, at higher germanium loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), the reduction at 500°C leads to lower UA selectivities compared to the reduction at 300°C. This suggests that the bimetallic effect becomes dominant at higher germanium contents.

4. The optimal UA selectivity is achieved at lower germanium contents for catalysts reduced at 500°C compared to those reduced at 300°C. This indicates that the combination of bimetallic and SMSI effects is crucial for achieving high selectivity.

5. The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on titania oxide is notable. These particles are more stable than those supported on alumina or silica, indicating the potential benefits of using titania as a support material for these catalysts.

这些应用包括精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化。采用理论分析和实验验证的方法来研究、优化并提升这种过程的选择性和效率。

1. 通过使用铑-锗和铂-锗体系在二氧化钛上的双金属催化剂，对含有α-β不饱和羰基的化合物进行氢化，尤其是在环己烷脱氢反应中，是这些催化剂的应用实例。根据锗含量调整双金属催化剂，无论是在300°C还是500°C下还原，都能实现对不饱和醇（UA）选择性的精确控制。

2. 当将还原温度提高到500°C时，催化剂表现出比较低温度更高的UA选择性。这归因于双金属和SMSI（强金属支撑相互作用）效应的协同作用。从可还原的二氧化钛支持物中产生的TiO(2x)物种增强了CO键的激活，从而提高了选择性向UA。

3. 然而，在较高锗负载量（Rh为1.3 wt%，Pt为0.5 wt%）下，500°C下的还原导致较低的UA选择性，与300°C相比。这表明在较高锗含量下，双金属效果占主导地位。

4. 最佳的UA选择性是在较低的锗含量下通过500°C还原获得的，与通过300°C还原的催化剂相比。这表明双金属和SMSI效应的结合对于实现高选择性至关重要。

5. 通过催化还原制备的铑-锗和铂-锗颗粒在二氧化钛上的稳定性值得注意。这些颗粒比在氧化铝或硅胶上支撑的颗粒更稳定，这表明使用二氧化钛作为催化剂材料的潜在优势。
