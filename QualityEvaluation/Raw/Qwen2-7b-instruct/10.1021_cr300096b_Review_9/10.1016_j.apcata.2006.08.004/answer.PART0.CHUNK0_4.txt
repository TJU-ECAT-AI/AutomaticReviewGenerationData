<p>For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C). At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined. In this case, both oxidized Ge and TiO(2x) species participate to the activation of the CO bond. On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C. The bimetallic effect is then predominant at high Ge loadings.</p>

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge on titania oxide supports can contribute significantly to industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodology employed involves studying, optimizing, and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the process. By varying the germanium content and the reduction temperature, researchers can achieve optimal conditions for maximizing the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (UA). At low germanium contents, a reduction at 500°C combines the bimetallic and SMSI effects, leading to higher UA selectivities due to the participation of both oxidized germanium and TiO(2x) species in activating the CO bond. However, at higher germanium loadings, the bimetallic effect becomes predominant, resulting in lower UA selectivities compared to reductions at 300°C. This demonstrates how the balance between germanium content, reduction temperature, and the bimetallic effect can be tuned to optimize the hydrogenation process for specific applications.

使用如Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge这样的双金属催化剂在氧化钛支持下进行C═O键的催化氢化，可以显著应用于精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域。采用的研究方法包括研究、优化和提高过程的选择性和效率。通过改变锗含量和还原温度，研究人员可以实现最大化不饱和醇（UA）选择性的条件。在较低锗含量的情况下，在500°C的还原条件下结合双金属和SMSI效应，由于参与激活CO键的氧化锗和TiO(2x)物种的作用，可以获得更高的UA选择性。然而，在较高锗负载量下，双金属效应占主导地位，导致与在300°C还原条件下获得的选择性相比，UA选择性更低。这表明如何平衡锗含量、还原温度和双金属效应可以调优氢化过程以适应特定应用。
