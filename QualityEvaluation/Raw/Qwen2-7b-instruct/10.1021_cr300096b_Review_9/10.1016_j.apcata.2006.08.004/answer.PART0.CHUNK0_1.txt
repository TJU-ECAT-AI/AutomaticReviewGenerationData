[1] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 for citral hydrogenation: II. Catalytic properties Abstract Bimetallic Rh-Ge/TiO2 and Pt-Ge/TiO2 catalysts prepared by surface redox reaction (catalytic reduction method) were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral."
[2] "For both Rh and Pt series, the unsaturated alcohols (UA) selectivity goes through an optimum as a function of the germanium content whatever the reduction temperature."
[3] "On the other hand, at high Ge loadings the bimetallic effect was predominant and led also to a high UA selectivity."
[4] "Moreover, TiO2 support contributed to stabilize the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction toward an air exposure at ambient temperature."
[5] "In the case of the Pt-Ge/TiO2 samples, the comparison of Table 2 and Fig. 3, Fig. 5 leads to the same conclusion, i.e., an air exposure induces the behaviour of a catalyst with a lower Ge content."

1. Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 were utilized for the selective hydrogenation of citral, which is a process critical in the synthesis of fine chemicals and biomass conversion. The germanium content significantly influences the catalyst's selectivity for unsaturated alcohols, with the selectivity peaking at certain germanium concentrations. The TiO2 support plays a role in stabilizing the bimetallic particles, even after exposure to air.

2. The methodology employed to study the catalytic properties includes testing the selectivity of the catalysts for citral hydrogenation. The germanium content was varied to observe its effect on the catalyst's performance, specifically the selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. The study also involved comparing the catalytic properties of the catalysts after air exposure to those of catalysts with lower germanium content.

3. The air exposure of the bimetallic catalysts led to a behavior similar to that of a catalyst with a lower germanium content. This suggests that after air exposure, the germanium segregates from the bimetallic particles on the catalyst, which might affect the catalyst's stability and selectivity.

4. The TiO2 support contributes to the stabilization of the bimetallic particles prepared by the catalytic reduction method, even after the catalysts are exposed to air. This is important for maintaining the catalyst's performance over multiple uses.

5. The study compared the catalytic properties of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts on TiO2 after air exposure to those of catalysts with lower germanium content. The results indicated that the air exposure led to a catalyst behavior consistent with a lower germanium content, implying a possible segregation of germanium from the bimetallic particles.

1. 使用TiO2支持的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂用于异构醇的精炼氢化，这一过程在精细化学品合成和生物质转换中至关重要。锗含量显著影响催化剂对不饱和醇的选择性，无论还原温度如何，该选择性都会随着锗含量的变化达到峰值。TiO2支持有助于稳定通过催化还原制备的双金属粒子，在室温下暴露于空气中。

2. 研究采用测试催化剂对异构醇选择性的方法来研究其催化性能。通过改变锗含量观察其对催化剂性能的影响，特别是对不饱和醇的选择性。研究还涉及比较催化剂在空气暴露后的性能与较低锗含量催化剂的性能。

3. 催化剂在空气暴露后表现出与较低锗含量催化剂相似的行为。这表明空气暴露导致锗从双金属颗粒分离，可能会影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

4. TiO2支持有助于稳定通过催化还原方法制备的双金属粒子，即使在催化剂暴露于空气中后也是如此。这对于维持催化剂多次使用时的性能非常重要。

5. 研究比较了在空气暴露后TiO2上支持的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂的催化性能与较低锗含量催化剂的性能。结果表明，空气暴露导致催化剂行为类似于较低锗含量，暗示可能存在锗从双金属颗粒分离的情况。
