[1] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide, prepared by the catalytic reduction method, were reduced either at 300 C or at 500 C (SMSI effect). All these systems were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral."
[2] "For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C)."
[3] "At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined."
[4] "On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C."
[5] "As a consequence, for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C), the optimum for the UA selectivity was obtained at lower germanium contents compared to their counterparts reduced at 300 C."
[6] "Moreover, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support."

1. Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts were created using the catalytic reduction technique and tested for selective hydrogenation of citral.
2. The selectivity for geraniol and nerol (unsaturated alcohols) peaks with germanium content regardless of whether the reduction occurred at 300°C or 500°C.
3. At lower germanium concentrations, higher selectivities were achieved after a 500°C reduction, combining the bimetallic and SMSI effects.
4. At higher germanium loads, a 500°C reduction resulted in lower selectivities compared to a 300°C reduction.
5. For catalysts reduced at 500°C, the optimal selectivity for unsaturated alcohols was achieved with lower germanium contents compared to those reduced at 300°C.
6. The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared on TiO2 support is notable, unlike those on alumina or silica.

1. 使用催化还原法制备的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂被用于测试对异构醇的精选择性氢化。
2. 不论在300°C还是500°C下，锗含量与选择性对于异构醇（如香叶醇和芳樟醇）达到峰值。
3. 在较低锗含量下，通过500°C处理可以获得较高的选择性，结合了双金属和SMSI效应。
4. 对于较高锗负载量，500°C处理导致的选择性低于300°C处理。
5. 对于在500°C处理的催化剂，达到最高异构醇选择性的锗含量低于在300°C处理的催化剂。
6. TiO2支持下制备的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge颗粒的稳定性显著，这与在氧化铝或硅胶上得到的结果不同。
