[1] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide, prepared by the catalytic reduction method, were reduced either at 300 C or at 500 C (SMSI effect)."
[2] "For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C)."
[3] "At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined."
[4] "On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C."
[5] "The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support."

1. Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide were prepared using a catalytic reduction method and tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral. The catalysts' properties were influenced by the germanium content and the reduction temperature (either 300 C or 500 C).

2. The selectivity for the formation of unsaturated alcohols (UA) increased with the germanium content in both Rh and Pt-based catalysts, regardless of the reduction temperature.

3. At lower germanium contents, the highest selectivities were achieved after reducing the catalysts at 500 C, combining the bimetallic and SMSI effects.

4. For higher germanium loadings, a reduction at 500 C resulted in lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reducing at 300 C. The bimetallic effect dominated at high germanium loadings.

5. The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared on a TiO2 support was remarkable compared to those on alumina or silica supports.

1. 使用催化还原方法制备的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂，支持在氧化钛上，并测试了对环己酮的选择性氢化。催化剂的性质受到锗含量和还原温度（300°C或500°C）的影响。

2. 在两种Rh和Pt基催化剂中，不饱和醇（UA）的选择性随锗含量增加，在任何降低温度下都能达到最大值。

3. 在较低锗含量的情况下，通过在500°C下还原催化剂，可以结合双金属和SMSI效应，从而获得最高的选择性。

4. 对于更高的锗负载量，500°C下的还原导致UA选择性低于在300°C下得到的选择性。此时，双金属效应占主导。

5. 与在氧化铝或硅胶上的支持相比，双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge颗粒在氧化钛支持下的稳定性非常出色。
