[1] "Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on titania oxide, prepared by the catalytic reduction method, were reduced either at 300 C or at 500 C (SMSI effect). All these systems were tested for the selective hydrogenation of citral."
[2] "For both Rh and Pt based samples, the selectivity in geraniol and nerol (UA) goes through a maximum as function of the Ge content whatever the reduction temperature (300 or 500 C)."
[3] "At low Ge contents, the higher selectivities were obtained after reduction at 500 C when the bimetallic and SMSI effects are combined."
[4] "On the other hand, for higher Ge loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), a reduction at 500 C led to lower UA selectivities compared to those obtained after reduction at 300 C."
[5] "As a consequence, for the bimetallic catalysts reduced at high temperature (500 C), the optimum for the UA selectivity was obtained at lower germanium contents compared to their counterparts reduced at 300 C."
[6] "Moreover, the stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on TiO2 support is noteworthy contrary to that obtained with an alumina or a silica support."

1. Bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts supported on TiO2 were utilized for the selective hydrogenation of citral, which is a process critical in the synthesis of fine chemicals and biomass conversion. The germanium content significantly influences the catalyst's selectivity for unsaturated alcohols, with the selectivity peaking at certain germanium concentrations. The TiO2 support plays a role in stabilizing the bimetallic particles, even after exposure to air.

2. The methodology employed to study the catalytic properties includes testing the selectivity of the catalysts for citral hydrogenation. The germanium content was varied to observe its effect on the catalyst's performance, specifically the selectivity for unsaturated alcohols. The study also involved comparing the catalytic properties of the catalysts after air exposure to those of catalysts with lower germanium content.

3. The air exposure of the bimetallic catalysts led to a behavior similar to that of a catalyst with a lower germanium content. This suggests that after air exposure, the germanium segregates from the bimetallic particles on the catalyst, which might affect the catalyst's stability and selectivity.

4. The TiO2 support contributes to the stabilization of the bimetallic particles prepared by the catalytic reduction method, even after the catalysts are exposed to air. This is important for maintaining the catalyst's performance over multiple uses.

5. The study compared the catalytic properties of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge catalysts on TiO2 after air exposure to those of catalysts with lower germanium content. The results indicated that the air exposure led to a catalyst behavior consistent with a lower germanium content, implying a possible segregation of germanium from the bimetallic particles.

1. 使用TiO2支持的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂用于异构醇的精炼氢化，这一过程在精细化学品合成和生物质转换中至关重要。锗含量显著影响催化剂对不饱和醇的选择性，无论还原温度如何，该选择性都会随着锗含量的变化达到峰值。TiO2支持有助于稳定通过催化还原制备的双金属粒子，在室温下暴露于空气中。

2. 研究采用测试催化剂对异构醇选择性的方法来研究其催化性能。通过改变锗含量观察其对催化剂性能的影响，特别是对不饱和醇的选择性。研究还涉及比较催化剂在空气暴露后的性能与较低锗含量催化剂的性能。

3. 催化剂在空气暴露后表现出与较低锗含量催化剂相似的行为。这表明空气暴露导致锗从双金属颗粒分离，可能会影响催化剂的稳定性和选择性。

4. TiO2支持有助于稳定通过催化还原方法制备的双金属粒子，即使在催化剂暴露于空气中后也是如此。这对于维持催化剂多次使用时的性能非常重要。

5. 研究比较了在空气暴露后TiO2上支持的双金属Rh-Ge和Pt-Ge催化剂的催化性能与较低锗含量催化剂的性能。结果表明，空气暴露导致催化剂行为类似于较低锗含量，暗示可能存在锗从双金属颗粒分离的情况。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge systems supported on titania oxide, plays a significant role in various industrial and research applications. These applications encompass fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include both theoretical analysis and experimental validation.

1. The hydrogenation of citral, an α-,β-unsaturated aldehyde, is a prime example of where these catalysts find application. The selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols (UA) can be finely tuned by adjusting the germanium content in the bimetallic catalysts, regardless of the reduction temperature (300°C or 500°C).

2. When the reduction temperature is increased to 500°C, the catalysts can exhibit a higher UA selectivity compared to lower temperatures. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of the bimetallic and SMSI (Strong Metal-Support Interaction) effects. The presence of TiO(2x) species derived from the reducible titania support enhances the activation of the CO bond, contributing to the selectivity towards UA.

3. However, at higher germanium loadings (1.3 wt% for Rh and 0.5 wt% for Pt), the reduction at 500°C leads to lower UA selectivities compared to the reduction at 300°C. This suggests that the bimetallic effect becomes dominant at higher germanium contents.

4. The optimal UA selectivity is achieved at lower germanium contents for catalysts reduced at 500°C compared to those reduced at 300°C. This indicates that the combination of bimetallic and SMSI effects is crucial for achieving high selectivity.

5. The stability of the bimetallic Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge particles prepared by catalytic reduction on titania oxide is notable. These particles are more stable than those supported on alumina or silica, indicating the potential benefits of using titania as a support material for these catalysts.

这些应用包括精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化。采用理论分析和实验验证的方法来研究、优化并提升这种过程的选择性和效率。

1. 通过使用铑-锗和铂-锗体系在二氧化钛上的双金属催化剂，对含有α-β不饱和羰基的化合物进行氢化，尤其是在环己烷脱氢反应中，是这些催化剂的应用实例。根据锗含量调整双金属催化剂，无论是在300°C还是500°C下还原，都能实现对不饱和醇（UA）选择性的精确控制。

2. 当将还原温度提高到500°C时，催化剂表现出比较低温度更高的UA选择性。这归因于双金属和SMSI（强金属支撑相互作用）效应的协同作用。从可还原的二氧化钛支持物中产生的TiO(2x)物种增强了CO键的激活，从而提高了选择性向UA。

3. 然而，在较高锗负载量（Rh为1.3 wt%，Pt为0.5 wt%）下，500°C下的还原导致较低的UA选择性，与300°C相比。这表明在较高锗含量下，双金属效果占主导地位。

4. 最佳的UA选择性是在较低的锗含量下通过500°C还原获得的，与通过300°C还原的催化剂相比。这表明双金属和SMSI效应的结合对于实现高选择性至关重要。

5. 通过催化还原制备的铑-锗和铂-锗颗粒在二氧化钛上的稳定性值得注意。这些颗粒比在氧化铝或硅胶上支撑的颗粒更稳定，这表明使用二氧化钛作为催化剂材料的潜在优势。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Rh-Ge and Pt-Ge on titania oxide supports can contribute significantly to industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodology employed involves studying, optimizing, and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the process. By varying the germanium content and the reduction temperature, researchers can achieve optimal conditions for maximizing the selectivity to unsaturated alcohols (UA). At low germanium contents, a reduction at 500°C combines the bimetallic and SMSI effects, leading to higher UA selectivities due to the participation of both oxidized germanium and TiO(2x) species in activating the CO bond. However, at higher germanium loadings, the bimetallic effect becomes predominant, resulting in lower UA selectivities compared to reductions at 300°C. This demonstrates how the balance between germanium content, reduction temperature, and the bimetallic effect can be tuned to optimize the hydrogenation process for specific applications.
