[Catalytic denitrification is an efficient technology for water purification [1,2] and many solid catalysts have been reported in the literature [35].]

[We have chosen the In,Pt metallic couple because In promoted catalysts have good activity for the nitrates conversion and a potential high selectivity to N2, as reported by other authors [16].]

[Therefore, it would also be interesting to get some insight on the origin of this phenomenon.]

[Fig. 1(A) shows that the Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst has low activity, and that the nitrate conversion strongly increases after the addition of 0.25wt% In.]

[As the reaction progresses, a small increase in nitrites concentration takes place, reaching 2.5 ppm as the maximum value for the catalyst with the highest In content.]

[Results for ammonia production are depicted in Fig. 3(A). In general, higher Pt:In ratios produce higher ammonia concentrations, reaching about 2223 ppm.]

[The activity of Pt,In catalysts can be explained with a redox mechanism similar to that proposed for Cu promoted Pd catalysts supported on Al2O3 [11].]

[Table 3 shows that the superficial Pt/In ratio in both SiO2 and Al2O3 supported catalysts is lower than in the bulk, both in fresh and used solids.]

[For comparison purposes, Table 1 also summarizes the activities and selectivities of the Pt/In catalysts and those obtained for Pd/Cu, Pd/In and Pd/Co catalysts, which were studied in a previous work [21].]

1. Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling selective and efficient reactions that produce desired products. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include kinetic experiments, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization techniques. These methods help understand the nature of the active sites, the reaction mechanisms, and the possibility of regenerating the highly active catalysts.

2. Among the catalysts studied, the Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst shows the highest initial activity for the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen, even surpassing the Pd,Cu catalyst. However, the conversion rate decreases with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide phases, affecting the catalyst's performance over time.

3. Catalysts supported on silica have lower activities compared to those on alumina. This is likely due to the lower positive zeta potential (PZC) of silica, which decreases the nitrate ions' adsorption rate.

4. The selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process can be optimized by tuning the metal composition, support materials, and reaction conditions. The selectivity to N2 and the formation of undesirable products like nitrites and ammonia can be controlled by adjusting the Pt:In ratio and the reaction parameters.

5. EXAFS experiments are planned to further confirm the existence of bimetallic particles and estimate their composition, providing insights into the active sites and reaction mechanisms of the Pt,In catalysts.

1. Pt-Ni系统的催化氢化C═O键，特别是在双金属催化剂中，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物转化等工业和研究应用做出了贡献。通过选择性且高效的反应产生所需产品。研究、优化和提高选择性和效率的方法包括动力学实验、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、温度程序还原（TPR）和X射线衍射（XRD）表征技术。这些方法有助于理解活性位点、反应机制以及再生高效催化剂的可能性。

2. 在研究的催化剂中，Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3催化剂在硝酸盐还原为氮气时表现出最高的初始活性，甚至超过了Pd,Cu催化剂。然而，随时间增加，转化率会下降，这是由于铂和铟氧化物相的分离影响了催化剂的性能。

3. 相对于铝氧化物支持的催化剂，硅基支持的催化剂具有较低的活性。这可能是由于硅的较低正电势（PZC），降低了硝酸根离子的吸附速率。

4. 通过调整金属组成、支持材料和反应条件，可以优化催化氢化过程的选择性和效率。可以通过调整Pt:In比率和反应参数来控制选择性到N2以及生成副产物如亚硝酸盐和氨的形成。

5. 计划进行EXAFS实验以进一步确认双金属颗粒的存在并估算其组成，提供有关活性位点和Pt,In催化剂反应机制的见解。
