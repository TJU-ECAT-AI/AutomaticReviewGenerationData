In this work, bimetallic Pt,In catalysts supported on alumina and silica were studied for the reduction of nitrate to N2 in water, using H2 as reducing agent. Kinetic and characterization results suggest that the active sites are bimetallic particles with the surface enriched in Indium, probably Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7 species.

The catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate to nitrogen using bimetallic Pt-In catalysts on alumina and silica supports contributes to water purification processes. The active sites identified are bimetallic particles with an enriched surface in Indium, possibly Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7 species.
