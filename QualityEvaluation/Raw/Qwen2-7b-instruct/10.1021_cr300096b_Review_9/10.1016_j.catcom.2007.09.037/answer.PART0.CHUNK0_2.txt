[1] "Kinetic experiments using Pt,In supported catalysts together with XPS and TPR results suggest that the active sites consist of bimetallic particles with the surface enriched in Indium, probably Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7."
[2] "Among the catalysts studied in this work, Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 is the most active one. At low time-on-stream, it has a very high conversion rate, even higher than that observed for the Pd,Cu catalyst."
[3] "Catalysts supported on silica have considerably lower activities,probably due to the lower PZC of the support, which would decrease the nitrate ions adsorption rate."

The catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate to nitrogen using bimetallic Pt-In catalysts on supports like alumina and silica offers a pathway for the reduction of nitrates in water. Kinetic studies coupled with XPS and TPR indicate that the active sites are likely bimetallic particles enriched in Indium, possibly Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7. The most active catalyst among those tested is Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3, which exhibits a high conversion rate initially but declines over time due to the segregation of Pt and In oxide phases under reacting conditions in the aqueous medium. Silica-supported catalysts show lower activity compared to alumina, possibly due to the lower PZC (potential zero charge) of silica, affecting nitrate ion adsorption.

本文研究了含In的Pt催化剂在水中的硝酸盐氢化反应，发现在水相中使用铂-铟双金属催化剂可以有效地将硝酸盐还原为氮气。动力学实验与XPS和TPR结果表明，活性位点可能是表面富集了In的双金属颗粒，可能是Pt2In3或Pt3In7。在所有测试的催化剂中，Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3表现出最高的活性，在初期具有很高的转化率，甚至高于钯-铜催化剂。然而，随着时间的推移，由于Pt和In氧化物相的分离，转化率会下降。与氧化铝相比，硅酸盐支持的催化剂活性较低，这可能是因为硅酸盐的PZC（零电荷电位）较低，影响了硝酸根离子的吸附。
