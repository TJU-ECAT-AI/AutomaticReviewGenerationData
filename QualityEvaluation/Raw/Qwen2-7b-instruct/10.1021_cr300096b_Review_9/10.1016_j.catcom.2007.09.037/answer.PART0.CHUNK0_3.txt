[1] "Catalytic denitrification is an efficient technology for water purification."
[2] "The aim of this work is to relate the catalytic activity of Pt,In catalysts to their physico-chemical properties and analyze how they are affected by the aqueous reaction media."
[3] "Of all the catalysts studied in this work, Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3 is the most active one. At low time-on-stream it has a very high conversion rate, but it decreases with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide phases under reacting conditions in the aqueous media."
[4] "Studies are under- way to further clarify the nature of the active sites, the reaction mechanism and the possibility of regenerating the highly active Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst."

This work investigates the relationship between the physical and chemical properties of Pt-In catalysts and their catalytic activity in water purification processes, specifically focusing on the reduction of nitrates to nitrogen gas. The most active catalyst studied was Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3, which initially showed high conversion rates but decreased over time due to the segregation of platinum and indium oxide phases in the aqueous media. Ongoing studies aim to understand the active sites, reaction mechanism, and potential regeneration of the active sites in this catalyst.

本研究探讨了铂-铟催化剂的物理和化学性质与其在水净化过程中硝酸盐还原至氮气催化活性之间的关系，特别关注水中的硝酸盐转化为氮气的过程。研究中发现，活性最高的催化剂是Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3，该催化剂在初始阶段显示出很高的转化率，但随着时间的推移，由于在水性介质中反应条件下铂和铟氧化物相的分离，其转化率降低。正在进行的研究旨在进一步了解催化剂的活性位点、反应机理以及高度活性的Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3催化剂活性位点的再生可能性。
