In this work, bimetallic Pt,In catalysts supported on alumina and silica were studied for the reduction of nitrate to N2 in water, using H2 as reducing agent. Kinetic and characterization results suggest that the active sites are bimetallic particles with the surface enriched in Indium, probably Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7 species.

2.1. "The aim of this work is to relate the catalytic activity of Pt,In catalysts to their physico-chemical properties and analyze how they are affected by the aqueous reaction media."
2.2. "We have chosen the In,Pt metallic couple because In promoted catalysts have good activity for the nitrates conversion and a potential high selectivity to N2, as reported by other authors [16]."
2.3. "On the other hand, in a preliminary screening of different catalysts we found that Pt(1 wt.%),In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3 has a remarkable initial activity, which decays after some minutes on stream."
2.4. "Fig. 1(A) shows that the Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst has low activity, and that the nitrate conversion strongly increases after the addition of 0.25wt% In. The In(0.25%)Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst shows a very high initial conversion rate but after ca. 15 min, it decreases reaching 67.7% of conversion at 100 min."
2.5. "We calculated the initial reaction rates at nitrate conversions lower than 10%. At low conversions, product concentrations are small; thus, the initial rate is an intrinsic property of the active sites towards the nitrate hydrogenation reaction."
2.6. "A series of Pt,In supported on SiO2 was also prepared in order to gain insight into the effect of the support. Fig. 1(B) shows that the nitrate conversion rates are considerably lower than for Pt,In/Al2O3."
2.7. "However, the ammonia concentrations are an order of magnitude lower (see Fig. 3(B)). For example, for the most active Pt,In/Al2O3 catalyst, the ammonia concentration is ca. 20 ppm at 100 min, while at the same time it is only ca. 1 ppm for SiO2 supported catalysts."
2.8. "The activity of Pt,In catalysts can be explained with a redox mechanism similar to that proposed for Cu promoted Pd catalysts supported on Al2O3 [11]."
2.9. "The chemical state of the elements and their relative proportions have been determined by photoelectron spectroscopy (Table 3)."
2.10. "The superficial Pt/In ratio in both SiO2 and Al2O3 supported catalysts is lower than in the bulk, both in fresh and used solids."
2.11. "However, the conversion rate decreases with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide phases, as shown in TPR and XRD characterization."
2.12. "Studies are under-way to further clarify the nature of the active sites, the reaction mechanism and the possibility of regenerating the highly active Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst."

Industrial and research applications involving the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems are significant in areas such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This technique is crucial for the efficient conversion of various organic compounds into valuable products. To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers often employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies. These methodologies include kinetic experiments, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and dynamic CO chemisorption measurements. These techniques help in understanding the surface chemistry, structure, and reactivity of the catalysts. Additionally, researchers aim to elucidate the nature of the active sites, the reaction mechanisms, and the possibility of regenerating the highly active catalysts to improve the overall efficiency and sustainability of the hydrogenation process.

In the context of the provided literature, the study focuses on the catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate using Pt-In bimetallic catalysts supported on alumina and silica. The literature discusses the preparation of the catalysts, their characterization through various techniques, and the effects of different parameters on their performance. The Pt-In system is chosen due to its reported good activity for nitrate conversion and potential high selectivity towards nitrogen gas. The literature also explores the impact of the support type on the catalyst's activity, with alumina-supported catalysts showing higher activity compared to silica-supported ones. The results suggest that the active sites are bimetallic particles with the surface enriched in Indium, possibly Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7 species. The most active catalyst, Pt(1 wt.%),In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3, exhibits remarkable initial activity but loses efficiency over time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide phases. This catalyst's initial high activity makes it promising for further studies on the reaction mechanism and potential regeneration methods.

在工业和研究领域中，使用Pt-Ni等双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化技术对于精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化具有重要意义。这种方法对于有效转化各种有机化合物并生成有价值的产品至关重要。为了研究、优化并提高该过程的选择性和效率，研究人员通常采用理论和实验相结合的方法。这些方法包括动力学实验、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)、温度程序还原(TPR)以及动态CO化学吸附测量。这些技术有助于理解催化剂的表面化学、结构和反应性。此外，研究人员致力于阐明活性位点的性质、反应机制以及高度活性催化剂的再生可能性，以提高整体效率和可持续性。

在提供的文献中，研究重点是使用Pt-In双金属催化剂进行硝酸盐的催化氢化。文献讨论了催化剂的制备、表征以及不同参数对其性能的影响。选择Pt-In系统是因为其报告的高硝酸盐转化率和潜在的高氮气选择性。文献还探讨了支持类型对催化剂活性的影响，发现氧化铝支持的催化剂比二氧化硅支持的催化剂活性更高。结果表明，活性位点是表面富含铟的双金属颗粒，可能是Pt2In3和/或Pt3In7物种。最活跃的催化剂，Pt(1 wt.%),In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3，在初期表现出显著的活性，但随时间逐渐降低，原因是Pt和铟氧化物相的分离。这种催化剂的初始高活性使其有潜力用于进一步研究反应机制和可能的再生方法。

The catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate to nitrogen using bimetallic Pt-In catalysts on supports like alumina and silica offers a pathway for the reduction of nitrates in water. Kinetic studies coupled with XPS and TPR indicate that the active sites are likely bimetallic particles enriched in Indium, possibly Pt2In3 and/or Pt3In7. The most active catalyst among those tested is Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3, which exhibits a high conversion rate initially but declines over time due to the segregation of Pt and In oxide phases under reacting conditions in the aqueous medium. Silica-supported catalysts show lower activity compared to alumina, possibly due to the lower PZC (potential zero charge) of silica, affecting nitrate ion adsorption.

本文研究了含In的Pt催化剂在水中的硝酸盐氢化反应，发现在水相中使用铂-铟双金属催化剂可以有效地将硝酸盐还原为氮气。动力学实验与XPS和TPR结果表明，活性位点可能是表面富集了In的双金属颗粒，可能是Pt2In3或Pt3In7。在所有测试的催化剂中，Pt(1 wt.%)In(0.25 wt.%)/Al2O3表现出最高的活性，在初期具有很高的转化率，甚至高于钯-铜催化剂。然而，随着时间的推移，由于Pt和In氧化物相的分离，转化率会下降。与氧化铝相比，硅酸盐支持的催化剂活性较低，这可能是因为硅酸盐的PZC（零电荷电位）较低，影响了硝酸根离子的吸附。

[Catalytic denitrification is an efficient technology for water purification [1,2] and many solid catalysts have been reported in the literature [35].]

[We have chosen the In,Pt metallic couple because In promoted catalysts have good activity for the nitrates conversion and a potential high selectivity to N2, as reported by other authors [16].]

[Therefore, it would also be interesting to get some insight on the origin of this phenomenon.]

[Fig. 1(A) shows that the Pt(1%)/Al2O3 catalyst has low activity, and that the nitrate conversion strongly increases after the addition of 0.25wt% In.]

[As the reaction progresses, a small increase in nitrites concentration takes place, reaching 2.5 ppm as the maximum value for the catalyst with the highest In content.]

[Results for ammonia production are depicted in Fig. 3(A). In general, higher Pt:In ratios produce higher ammonia concentrations, reaching about 2223 ppm.]

[The activity of Pt,In catalysts can be explained with a redox mechanism similar to that proposed for Cu promoted Pd catalysts supported on Al2O3 [11].]

[Table 3 shows that the superficial Pt/In ratio in both SiO2 and Al2O3 supported catalysts is lower than in the bulk, both in fresh and used solids.]

[For comparison purposes, Table 1 also summarizes the activities and selectivities of the Pt/In catalysts and those obtained for Pd/Cu, Pd/In and Pd/Co catalysts, which were studied in a previous work [21].]

1. Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling selective and efficient reactions that produce desired products. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include kinetic experiments, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization techniques. These methods help understand the nature of the active sites, the reaction mechanisms, and the possibility of regenerating the highly active catalysts.

2. Among the catalysts studied, the Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3 catalyst shows the highest initial activity for the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen, even surpassing the Pd,Cu catalyst. However, the conversion rate decreases with time due to the segregation of Pt and Indium oxide phases, affecting the catalyst's performance over time.

3. Catalysts supported on silica have lower activities compared to those on alumina. This is likely due to the lower positive zeta potential (PZC) of silica, which decreases the nitrate ions' adsorption rate.

4. The selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process can be optimized by tuning the metal composition, support materials, and reaction conditions. The selectivity to N2 and the formation of undesirable products like nitrites and ammonia can be controlled by adjusting the Pt:In ratio and the reaction parameters.

5. EXAFS experiments are planned to further confirm the existence of bimetallic particles and estimate their composition, providing insights into the active sites and reaction mechanisms of the Pt,In catalysts.

1. Pt-Ni系统的催化氢化C═O键，特别是在双金属催化剂中，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物转化等工业和研究应用做出了贡献。通过选择性且高效的反应产生所需产品。研究、优化和提高选择性和效率的方法包括动力学实验、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、温度程序还原（TPR）和X射线衍射（XRD）表征技术。这些方法有助于理解活性位点、反应机制以及再生高效催化剂的可能性。

2. 在研究的催化剂中，Pt(1%)In(0.25%)/Al2O3催化剂在硝酸盐还原为氮气时表现出最高的初始活性，甚至超过了Pd,Cu催化剂。然而，随时间增加，转化率会下降，这是由于铂和铟氧化物相的分离影响了催化剂的性能。

3. 相对于铝氧化物支持的催化剂，硅基支持的催化剂具有较低的活性。这可能是由于硅的较低正电势（PZC），降低了硝酸根离子的吸附速率。

4. 通过调整金属组成、支持材料和反应条件，可以优化催化氢化过程的选择性和效率。可以通过调整Pt:In比率和反应参数来控制选择性到N2以及生成副产物如亚硝酸盐和氨的形成。

5. 计划进行EXAFS实验以进一步确认双金属颗粒的存在并估算其组成，提供有关活性位点和Pt,In催化剂反应机制的见解。
