1. Different types of carbon materials with varying proportions of micro- and mesoporosity were examined using a variety of NMR techniques. These methods were utilized to investigate the pore structure and the adsorbate's interaction with the pore walls.
2. The pore size distributions for the RGC30 and MAC-LMA12 samples were determined through NMR cryoporometry.
3. In the Takeda 4A material, the relaxation rates of adsorbates were higher and their diffusivities were lower compared to the Takeda 5A material.
4. In the MAC-LMA12 material, two distinct molecular species were identified, each displaying different relaxation and diffusion characteristics.
