[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials."
[2] "We demonstrate compatibility between the evidence of classical sorption experiments and NMR cryoporometry on pore size distribution."
[3] "There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients."
[4] "These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space."
[5] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 lm."

The document discusses the use of NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry to characterize porous carbon materials. These methods help in determining the pore size distribution, nuclear magnetic relaxation rates, and diffusion coefficients. These variations are indicative of heterogeneities in the pore space and can be estimated to extend over a spatial region of approximately 20 micrometers.

该文档讨论了如何使用核磁共振（NMR）测热法、弛豫度测量和扩散度测量来表征多孔碳材料。这些方法有助于确定孔径分布、核磁共振弛豫率和扩散系数。这些变化表明孔隙空间中的异质性，并且可以估计具有结构差异的区域的空间范围大约为20微米。
