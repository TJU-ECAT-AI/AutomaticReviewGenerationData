[1] "Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials."
[2] "There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients."
[3] "These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space."
[4] "Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 lm."
[5] "Nanoporous carbon materials are used in a wide range of industrial applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, separation, storage of gases and fluid purification."
[6] "The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materials strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used."
[7] "The relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene were shorter than in toluene correlates with the much stronger polarity of these liquids in comparison with toluene."
[8] "This is attributed to the presence of mesopores which tend to confine the dominating part of the liquid."

1. NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry techniques were utilized to examine porous carbon materials. 
2. Distributions in nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients were observed, which correspond to variations in the pore space. 
3. The spatial extent of regions with structural differences, indicated by differences in probe molecule diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation, might be approximately 20 micrometers.
4. Nanoporous carbon materials find extensive use in various industrial sectors such as heterogeneous catalysis, gas storage, and fluid purification.
5. The composition of micropores and mesopores in carbon materials largely depends on the synthesis methodology applied.
6. The shorter relaxation times of ethanol and nitrobenzene compared to toluene can be attributed to their higher polarity.
7. The presence of mesopores leads to the confinement of the dominant portion of the liquid.

1. 对多孔碳材料进行了核磁共振（NMR）孔压测量、弛豫度测量和扩散性测量，以进行表征。
2. 核磁共振弛豫率分布和扩散系数的分布与孔隙空间的变化相关联。  
3. 存在结构性差异的区域的空间范围，通过探针分子的扩散和核磁共振弛豫的变化来指示，可能约为20微米。
4. 纳米多孔碳材料广泛应用于包括异相催化、气体存储和流体净化在内的多个工业领域。
5. 碳材料中微孔和介孔的比例主要取决于合成过程的使用方法。
6. 乙醇和硝基苯的较短弛豫时间可以归因于它们与甲苯相比较高的极性。
7. 介孔的存在导致液态物质的主要部分被限制。
