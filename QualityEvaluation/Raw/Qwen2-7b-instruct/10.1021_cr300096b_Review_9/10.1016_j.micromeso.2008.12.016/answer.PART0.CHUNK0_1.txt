<p>Combined NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry and diffusometry were applied to characterize porous carbon materials.</p>
<p>There is a distribution in both the nuclear magnetic relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients. These distributions have to be referred to heterogeneities in the pore space.</p>
<p>Since they can only be observed if their influence is not averaged out on the diffusion paths covered by the molecules during the respective measurements, the spatial extension of the regions with structural differences (as evidenced by the dif- ferences in diffusion and nuclear magnetic relaxation of the probe molecules) may be estimated to be at least of the order of 20 lm.</p>
<p>The proportion of micropores and mesopores on carbon materials strongly depends on the synthesis procedure used.</p>
<p>Although the presence of microporosity is required to achieve a high surface area, i.e. a high adsorption capacity, the presence of some mesoporosity is quite often desirable.</p>
<p>Nanoporous carbon materials are used in a wide range of industrial applications, including heterogeneous catalysis, separation, storage of gases and fluid purification.</p>

1. NMR cryoporometry, relaxometry, and diffusometry were used to analyze porous carbon materials. 
2. Distributions in relaxation rates and diffusion coefficients were linked to variations in pore space.
3. Structural differences observed through probe molecule behavior suggest a spatial extent of at least 20 micrometers.
4. The ratio of micropores to mesopores in carbon materials depends on the synthesis process.
5. Microporosity is crucial for high surface area and adsorption capacity, while mesoporosity is beneficial for processes involving larger molecules and enhancing access to micropores.
6. Nanoporous carbon materials find applications in heterogeneous catalysis, separation, gas storage, and fluid purification.
