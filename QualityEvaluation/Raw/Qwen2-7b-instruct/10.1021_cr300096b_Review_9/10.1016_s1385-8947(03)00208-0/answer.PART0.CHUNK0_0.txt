<p>The first objective of this paper was to carry out and compare the accuracy of pulse and static hydrogen and oxygen chemisorption techniques on a monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and a series of coimpregnated PtSn catalysts.</p>

<p>Adding tin to platinum catalysts has proven to be beneficial for activity maintenance in applications such as catalytic reforming.</p>
<p>In the coimpregnated catalyst series, the O/Pt ratio increased with increasing Sn content.</p>
<p>The H/Pt ratio, on the other hand, reached the maximum value at 0.1 wt.% Sn.</p>
<p>Pulse chemisorption was then used to evaluate how the preparation method affects platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior.</p>
<p>Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates high Pt dispersion, while sequential impregnation of the support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to much lower Pt dispersion.</p>

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of pulse and static chemisorption methods for hydrogen and oxygen adsorption on a monometallic platinum catalyst and a series of platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts. The objectives were to assess how the preparation method impacts platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior, contrasting catalysts prepared through coimpregnation of Pt and Sn with those prepared sequentially with tin first. The research highlighted that adding tin to platinum catalysts enhances their performance in processes like catalytic reforming. As tin content increased, the oxygen-to-platinum (O/Pt) ratio rose, while the hydrogen-to-platinum (H/Pt) ratio peaked at 0.1% tin. The study also found that coimpregnation of the support with Pt and Sn promotes high platinum dispersion, whereas sequential impregnation with tin first followed by Pt results in lower dispersion.

本文旨在比较脉冲和静态吸附方法在单金属铂催化剂和一系列铂锡（PtSn）催化剂上的氢气和氧气吸附效果。研究目标是评估制备方法对铂分散度和吸附行为的影响，对比通过共浸渍铂和锡制备的催化剂与先以锡浸渍然后铂浸渍的催化剂。研究指出，在铂催化剂中添加锡可以提高其在催化重整等应用中的活性。随着锡含量的增加，氧/铂（O/Pt）比上升，而氢/铂（H/Pt）比在0.1%锡时达到峰值。研究还发现，通过共浸渍支持材料与铂和少量锡促进高铂分散度，而先以锡浸渍然后铂浸渍导致较低的分散度。
