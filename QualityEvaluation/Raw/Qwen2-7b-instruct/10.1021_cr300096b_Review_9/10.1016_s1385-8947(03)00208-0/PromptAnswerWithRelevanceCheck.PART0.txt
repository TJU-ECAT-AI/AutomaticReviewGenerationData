This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of pulse and static chemisorption methods for hydrogen and oxygen adsorption on a monometallic platinum catalyst and a series of platinum-tin (PtSn) catalysts. The objectives were to assess how the preparation method impacts platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior, contrasting catalysts prepared through coimpregnation of Pt and Sn with those prepared sequentially with tin first. The research highlighted that adding tin to platinum catalysts enhances their performance in processes like catalytic reforming. As tin content increased, the oxygen-to-platinum (O/Pt) ratio rose, while the hydrogen-to-platinum (H/Pt) ratio peaked at 0.1% tin. The study also found that coimpregnation of the support with Pt and Sn promotes high platinum dispersion, whereas sequential impregnation with tin first followed by Pt results in lower dispersion.

[1] "The method of catalyst preparation has great influence over the metal dispersion and adsorption behavior. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates the formation of high Pt dispersion, exceeding the dispersion of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar Pt loading. However, sequential impregnation of the Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion, as evidenced by consistently lower H/Pt and O/Pt ratios as compared to coimpregnated catalysts with similar overall Pt and Sn loading."
[2] "In the tin containing catalysts, the O/Pt ratios obtained are consistently higher than the H/Pt ratios, showing a trend towards enhanced oxygen uptake with increasing Sn content. It appears that oxygen adsorbed on highly dispersed platinum particles can migrate from the platinum sites to adjacent tin sites, populating the Sn surface. Sn is in a state of Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV), according to XPS results. This enhancement of oxygen uptake is not observed on catalysts containing large amount of tin, but low platinum dispersion, suggesting that the presence of highly dispersed platinum is required for populating nearby tin sites with oxygen."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is optimized and enhanced through methodologies that focus on studying, understanding, and controlling the selectivity and efficiency of the reaction. 

In the context of this study, the preparation method of the catalyst plays a crucial role in determining its performance. Specifically, the coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin leads to a higher dispersion of platinum, surpassing the dispersion found in monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar platinum loading. On the other hand, sequential impregnation of the support with tin followed by platinum results in lower dispersion, as evidenced by lower H/Pt and O/Pt ratios compared to coimpregnated catalysts with similar overall platinum and tin loading. 

Moreover, the presence of tin in the catalyst system leads to an enhancement of oxygen uptake, particularly on highly dispersed platinum particles. This oxygen migration from platinum sites to adjacent tin sites suggests that highly dispersed platinum is essential for populating nearby tin sites with oxygen. The tin is observed to exist in a state of Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV), according to XPS results, contributing to the observed trend of increased oxygen uptake with increasing tin content.

在铂镍双金属催化剂如铂钯系统的催化下，C═O键的氢化作用在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究应用中发挥着重要作用。通过研究、理解和控制反应的选择性和效率，这种方法得到了优化和增强。

在本研究中，催化剂的制备方法对性能至关重要。具体而言，将氧化铝载体与少量的铂和锡进行共浸渍可以实现铂的高分散度，超过具有相似铂负载的单金属铂氧化铝催化剂。另一方面，先用锡浸渍载体，然后再用铂浸渍，导致较低的分散度，这体现在与相似总体铂和锡加载的共浸渍催化剂相比，更低的H/Pt和O/Pt比率。

此外，在催化剂系统中存在锡导致氧气吸收增加，特别是在高度分散的铂粒子上。从铂位到相邻的锡位的氧迁移表明，高度分散的铂对于填充附近锡位上的氧是必不可少的。根据XPS结果，锡被观察到以Sn(II)和/或Sn(IV)状态存在，这有助于观察到随锡含量增加而增加的氧吸收趋势。

The differences in hydrogen and oxygen gas uptake behavior can be attributed to the different equilibration times provided by the two chemisorption methods. The method of catalyst preparation has great influence over the metal dispersion and adsorption behavior. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates the formation of high Pt dispersion, exceeding the dispersion of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar Pt loading. However, sequential impregnation of the Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion. Oxygen adsorbed on highly dispersed platinum particles can migrate from the platinum sites to adjacent tin sites, populating the Sn surface, enhancing the oxygen uptake.

氢和氧气体吸附行为的差异可以归因于两种化学吸附方法提供的不同平衡时间。催化剂制备方法对金属分散性和吸附行为有很大影响。通过将氧化铝支持体与少量的铂和锡共浸渍，可以促进高铂分散性的形成，超过具有相似铂负载的单金属铂/氧化铝催化剂。然而，先用锡浸渍氧化铝载体，然后用铂浸渍，会导致低铂分散性。高度分散的铂上吸附的氧可以迁移到附近的锡位点，填充Sn表面，增强氧吸附。

This paper discusses the effect of catalyst preparation and chemisorption methods on the uptake of hydrogen and oxygen by bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts. It highlights that pulse chemisorption provides lower uptakes compared to static volumetric chemisorption due to different equilibration times. The O/Pt ratio increases with the addition of tin in the coimpregnated catalyst series, whereas the H/Pt ratio peaks at a specific tin content. The preparation method impacts platinum dispersion, with coimpregnation leading to higher dispersion compared to sequential impregnation. This study reveals that tin addition benefits platinum catalyst activity in applications like catalytic reforming and that the interaction between tin and platinum is influenced by the preparation method. The paper also suggests that high dispersion of platinum enhances oxygen uptake in bimetallic catalysts with tin content.

本文探讨了催化剂制备和化学吸附方法对铂锡双金属催化剂中氢气和氧气吸收的影响。它指出脉冲化学吸附提供的吸收量低于静态体积化学吸附，这是由于不同的平衡时间。在共浸渍催化剂系列中，氧/铂比随着锡含量的增加而增加，而氢/铂比在特定锡含量时达到峰值。制备方法影响铂的分散度，共浸渍导致分散度高于顺序浸渍。这项研究表明，锡的添加可以提高铂催化剂在催化重整等应用中的活性，并且锡和铂之间的相互作用受制备方法的影响。文章还表明，在含锡量高的催化剂中，高分散的铂可以增强氧的吸收。

In the coimpregnated catalyst series, the O/Pt ratio increased with increasing Sn content. The H/Pt ratio, on the other hand, reached the maximum value at 0.1 wt.% Sn.

Pulse chemisorption was then used to evaluate how the preparation method affects platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior.

The study found that the pulse chemisorption method provides lower uptakes of hydrogen and oxygen compared to the static volumetric chemisorption method. This discrepancy is attributed to the different equilibration times offered by the two methods. In coimpregnated PtSn catalysts, the oxygen-to-platinum ratio increases with increasing tin content, whereas the hydrogen-to-platinum ratio peaks at 0.1 wt.% tin. The preparation method significantly influences platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin promotes high platinum dispersion, whereas sequential impregnation of tin followed by platinum results in much lower dispersion.

研究发现，脉冲化学吸附方法提供的氢和氧吸附量比体积静态化学吸附方法低。这种差异归因于两种方法提供不同的平衡时间。在共浸渍的PtSn催化剂中，氧与铂的比例随锡含量的增加而增加，而氢与铂的比例在0.1 wt.% 锡时达到峰值。制备方法对铂的分散性和化学吸附行为有显著影响。通过共浸渍的方式将铂和少量锡浸渍到氧化铝支撑材料上可促进高铂分散性，而先用锡进行序贯浸渍，然后再用铂浸渍，导致铂分散性大幅降低。
