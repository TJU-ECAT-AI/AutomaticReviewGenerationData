The differences in hydrogen and oxygen gas uptake behavior can be attributed to the different equilibration times provided by the two chemisorption methods. In the coimpregnated catalyst series, the O/Pt ratio increased with increasing Sn content. The H/Pt ratio, on the other hand, reached the maximum value at 0.1 wt.% Sn.

Pulse chemisorption was then used to evaluate how the preparation method affects platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior. The alumina-supported catalyst series prepared by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn was compared with a series of catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation with tin first, followed by platinum as second component. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates high Pt dispersion, while sequential impregnation of the support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to much lower Pt dispersion.

The study found that the pulse chemisorption method provides lower uptakes of hydrogen and oxygen compared to the static volumetric chemisorption method. This discrepancy is attributed to the different equilibration times offered by the two methods. In coimpregnated PtSn catalysts, the oxygen-to-platinum ratio increases with increasing tin content, whereas the hydrogen-to-platinum ratio peaks at 0.1 wt.% tin. The preparation method significantly influences platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin promotes high platinum dispersion, whereas sequential impregnation of tin followed by platinum results in much lower dispersion.

研究发现，脉冲化学吸附方法提供的氢和氧吸附量比体积静态化学吸附方法低。这种差异归因于两种方法提供不同的平衡时间。在共浸渍的PtSn催化剂中，氧与铂的比例随锡含量的增加而增加，而氢与铂的比例在0.1 wt.% 锡时达到峰值。制备方法对铂的分散性和化学吸附行为有显著影响。通过共浸渍的方式将铂和少量锡浸渍到氧化铝支撑材料上可促进高铂分散性，而先用锡进行序贯浸渍，然后再用铂浸渍，导致铂分散性大幅降低。
