[1] "The method of catalyst preparation has great influence over the metal dispersion and adsorption behavior. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates the formation of high Pt dispersion, exceeding the dispersion of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar Pt loading. However, sequential impregnation of the Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion, as evidenced by consistently lower H/Pt and O/Pt ratios as compared to coimpregnated catalysts with similar overall Pt and Sn loading."
[2] "In the tin containing catalysts, the O/Pt ratios obtained are consistently higher than the H/Pt ratios, showing a trend towards enhanced oxygen uptake with increasing Sn content. It appears that oxygen adsorbed on highly dispersed platinum particles can migrate from the platinum sites to adjacent tin sites, populating the Sn surface. Sn is in a state of Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV), according to XPS results. This enhancement of oxygen uptake is not observed on catalysts containing large amount of tin, but low platinum dispersion, suggesting that the presence of highly dispersed platinum is required for populating nearby tin sites with oxygen."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is optimized and enhanced through methodologies that focus on studying, understanding, and controlling the selectivity and efficiency of the reaction. 

In the context of this study, the preparation method of the catalyst plays a crucial role in determining its performance. Specifically, the coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin leads to a higher dispersion of platinum, surpassing the dispersion found in monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar platinum loading. On the other hand, sequential impregnation of the support with tin followed by platinum results in lower dispersion, as evidenced by lower H/Pt and O/Pt ratios compared to coimpregnated catalysts with similar overall platinum and tin loading. 

Moreover, the presence of tin in the catalyst system leads to an enhancement of oxygen uptake, particularly on highly dispersed platinum particles. This oxygen migration from platinum sites to adjacent tin sites suggests that highly dispersed platinum is essential for populating nearby tin sites with oxygen. The tin is observed to exist in a state of Sn(II) and/or Sn(IV), according to XPS results, contributing to the observed trend of increased oxygen uptake with increasing tin content.

在铂镍双金属催化剂如铂钯系统的催化下，C═O键的氢化作用在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究应用中发挥着重要作用。通过研究、理解和控制反应的选择性和效率，这种方法得到了优化和增强。

在本研究中，催化剂的制备方法对性能至关重要。具体而言，将氧化铝载体与少量的铂和锡进行共浸渍可以实现铂的高分散度，超过具有相似铂负载的单金属铂氧化铝催化剂。另一方面，先用锡浸渍载体，然后再用铂浸渍，导致较低的分散度，这体现在与相似总体铂和锡加载的共浸渍催化剂相比，更低的H/Pt和O/Pt比率。

此外，在催化剂系统中存在锡导致氧气吸收增加，特别是在高度分散的铂粒子上。从铂位到相邻的锡位的氧迁移表明，高度分散的铂对于填充附近锡位上的氧是必不可少的。根据XPS结果，锡被观察到以Sn(II)和/或Sn(IV)状态存在，这有助于观察到随锡含量增加而增加的氧吸收趋势。
