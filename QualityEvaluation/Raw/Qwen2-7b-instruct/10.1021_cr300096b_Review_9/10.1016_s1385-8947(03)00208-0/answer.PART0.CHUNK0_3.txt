<p>The differences in hydrogen and oxygen gas uptake behavior can be attributed to the different equilibration times provided by the two chemisorption methods.</p>
<p>In the coimpregnated catalyst series, the O/Pt ratio increased with increasing Sn content. The H/Pt ratio, on the other hand, reached the maximum value at 0.1 wt.% Sn.</p>
<p>Pulse chemisorption was then used to evaluate how the preparation method affects platinum dispersion and chemisorption behavior. The alumina-supported catalyst series prepared by coimpregnation of Pt and Sn was compared with a series of catalysts prepared by sequential impregnation with tin first, followed by platinum as second component.</p>
<p>Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates high Pt dispersion, while sequential impregnation of the support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to much lower Pt dispersion.</p>

<p>Adding tin to platinum catalysts has proven to be beneficial for activity maintenance in applications such as catalytic reforming.</p>
<p>The catalyst preparation method, especially the impregnation sequence, is known to affect the interaction of tin and platinum.</p>
<p>Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates the formation of high Pt dispersion, exceeding the dispersion of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar Pt loading.</p>
<p>Sequential impregnation of the Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion, as evidenced by consistently lower H/Pt and O/Pt ratios as compared to coimpregnated catalysts with similar overall Pt and Sn loading.</p>
<p>In the tin containing catalysts, the O/Pt ratios obtained are consistently higher than the H/Pt ratios, showing a trend towards enhanced oxygen uptake with increasing Sn content.</p>

This paper discusses the effect of catalyst preparation and chemisorption methods on the uptake of hydrogen and oxygen by bimetallic Pt-Sn catalysts. It highlights that pulse chemisorption provides lower uptakes compared to static volumetric chemisorption due to different equilibration times. The O/Pt ratio increases with the addition of tin in the coimpregnated catalyst series, whereas the H/Pt ratio peaks at a specific tin content. The preparation method impacts platinum dispersion, with coimpregnation leading to higher dispersion compared to sequential impregnation. This study reveals that tin addition benefits platinum catalyst activity in applications like catalytic reforming and that the interaction between tin and platinum is influenced by the preparation method. The paper also suggests that high dispersion of platinum enhances oxygen uptake in bimetallic catalysts with tin content.

本文探讨了催化剂制备和化学吸附方法对铂锡双金属催化剂中氢气和氧气吸收的影响。它指出脉冲化学吸附提供的吸收量低于静态体积化学吸附，这是由于不同的平衡时间。在共浸渍催化剂系列中，氧/铂比随着锡含量的增加而增加，而氢/铂比在特定锡含量时达到峰值。制备方法影响铂的分散度，共浸渍导致分散度高于顺序浸渍。这项研究表明，锡的添加可以提高铂催化剂在催化重整等应用中的活性，并且锡和铂之间的相互作用受制备方法的影响。文章还表明，在含锡量高的催化剂中，高分散的铂可以增强氧的吸收。
