The differences in hydrogen and oxygen gas uptake behavior can be attributed to the different equilibration times provided by the two chemisorption methods. The method of catalyst preparation has great influence over the metal dispersion and adsorption behavior. Coimpregnation of the Al2O3 support with platinum and small amounts of tin facilitates the formation of high Pt dispersion, exceeding the dispersion of monometallic Pt/Al2O3 catalysts with similar Pt loading. However, sequential impregnation of the Al2O3 support with Sn first, followed by Pt, leads to low Pt dispersion. Oxygen adsorbed on highly dispersed platinum particles can migrate from the platinum sites to adjacent tin sites, populating the Sn surface, enhancing the oxygen uptake.

氢和氧气体吸附行为的差异可以归因于两种化学吸附方法提供的不同平衡时间。催化剂制备方法对金属分散性和吸附行为有很大影响。通过将氧化铝支持体与少量的铂和锡共浸渍，可以促进高铂分散性的形成，超过具有相似铂负载的单金属铂/氧化铝催化剂。然而，先用锡浸渍氧化铝载体，然后用铂浸渍，会导致低铂分散性。高度分散的铂上吸附的氧可以迁移到附近的锡位点，填充Sn表面，增强氧吸附。
