1. The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules, especially those containing multiple functional groups, is crucial for industrial production of fine chemicals. The process involves transforming a carbonyl bond in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde into an unsaturated alcohol. This transformation is often achieved by using platinum-based catalysts, which can be enhanced by incorporating a second, more electropositive metal such as tin. The interaction between the platinum and tin species, whether they form alloys or mixtures, influences the catalyst's selectivity and activity.

2. In the context of the study, the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol) was observed in catalysts with larger bimetallic particles. These particles were associated with a higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species. This suggests that the presence of oxidized tin contributes to the selectivity of the hydrogenation process.

3. Catalysts prepared using separate metal precursors contained a higher amount of residual chlorides. These chlorides had a significant impact on the catalytic activity, but only a minor effect on the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.

4. Increasing the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) from 673 K to 773 K resulted in a substantial removal of surface chlorides. This led to a notable increase in the catalytic activity but only a slight enhancement in the selectivity for the production of crotyl alcohol.

1. 对于包含多个功能基团的有机分子的选择性氢化，对于精细化学品的工业生产具有巨大潜力。该过程涉及将α,β-不饱和醛中的羰基键转化为不饱和醇。通常，通过使用铂基催化剂，并通过引入更正电性的金属如锡来实现这一转换。铂和锡物种之间的相互作用，无论是形成合金还是混合物，都影响催化剂的选择性和活性。

2. 在研究中，最大的选择性对于不饱和醇（但-2-烯醇）在含有更大双金属颗粒的催化剂中被观察到。这些颗粒与氧化锡表面浓度更高相关。这表明氧化锡的存在有助于氢化过程的选择性。

3. 使用单独金属前体制备的催化剂含有更高的残留氯化物。这些氯化物对催化活性有显著影响，但仅轻微改变对羰基键氢化的选择性。

4. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度从673 K增加到773 K导致表面氯化物的显著去除。这导致催化活性显著增加，但仅轻微提高了生成丙烯醇的选择性。
