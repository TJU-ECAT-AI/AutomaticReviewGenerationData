[1] "The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production."
[2] "For catalysts prepared with the bimetallic complex, the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol) was achieved for the catalyst containing larger bimetallic particles, which are associated with a higher surface concentration of oxidised tin species."
[3] "The catalyst prepared with separate metal precursors contains a higher amount of residual chlorides, which significantly affect the catalytic activity but only slightly alter the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."
[4] "The reduction of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) at a higher temperature (773 K) removes a significant amount of surface chlorides, which is paralleled by an increase in the catalytic activity, but only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol."

1. The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules, especially those containing multiple functional groups, is crucial for industrial production of fine chemicals. The process involves transforming a carbonyl bond in an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde into an unsaturated alcohol. This transformation is often achieved by using platinum-based catalysts, which can be enhanced by incorporating a second, more electropositive metal such as tin. The interaction between the platinum and tin species, whether they form alloys or mixtures, influences the catalyst's selectivity and activity.

2. In the context of the study, the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol) was observed in catalysts with larger bimetallic particles. These particles were associated with a higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species. This suggests that the presence of oxidized tin contributes to the selectivity of the hydrogenation process.

3. Catalysts prepared using separate metal precursors contained a higher amount of residual chlorides. These chlorides had a significant impact on the catalytic activity, but only a minor effect on the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.

4. Increasing the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) from 673 K to 773 K resulted in a substantial removal of surface chlorides. This led to a notable increase in the catalytic activity but only a slight enhancement in the selectivity for the production of crotyl alcohol.

1. 对于包含多个功能基团的有机分子的选择性氢化，对于精细化学品的工业生产具有巨大潜力。该过程涉及将α,β-不饱和醛中的羰基键转化为不饱和醇。通常，通过使用铂基催化剂，并通过引入更正电性的金属如锡来实现这一转换。铂和锡物种之间的相互作用，无论是形成合金还是混合物，都影响催化剂的选择性和活性。

2. 在研究中，最大的选择性对于不饱和醇（但-2-烯醇）在含有更大双金属颗粒的催化剂中被观察到。这些颗粒与氧化锡表面浓度更高相关。这表明氧化锡的存在有助于氢化过程的选择性。

3. 使用单独金属前体制备的催化剂含有更高的残留氯化物。这些氯化物对催化活性有显著影响，但仅轻微改变对羰基键氢化的选择性。

4. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度从673 K增加到773 K导致表面氯化物的显著去除。这导致催化活性显著增加，但仅轻微提高了生成丙烯醇的选择性。

[1] "The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production."
[2] "Its performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and metallic and oxidised tin species."
[3] "The method followed and the metal precursors used in the preparation of catalysts clearly affect the catalytic performance."
[4] "The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts was related to the catalytic behaviour in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (but-2-enal)."
[5] "For catalysts prepared with the bimetallic complex, the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol) was achieved for the catalyst containing larger bimetallic particles, which are associated with a higher surface concentration of oxidised tin species."
[6] "The catalyst prepared with separate metal precursors contains a higher amount of residual chlorides, which significantly affect the catalytic activity but only slightly alter the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."
[7] "Furthermore, the support also plays a key role: the MgO-supported PtSn alloy shows higher selectivity for dehydrogenated products than silica- or alumina-supported catalysts."
[8] "Thus, the reduction of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) at a higher temperature (773 K) removes a significant amount of surface chlorides, which is paralleled by an increase in the catalytic activity, but only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol."

1. The hydrogenation of organic molecules with multiple functional groups provides substantial potential for the production of fine chemicals through industrial processes. The effectiveness of the hydrogenation process, particularly concerning the C═O bond, is influenced by factors including the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation technique, and the interaction between platinum and tin species. The type of metal precursors used in the catalyst preparation process significantly impacts its performance.

2. The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts are closely tied to their behavior in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Larger bimetallic particles of the PtSn alloy, characterized by a higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species, yield the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol, but-2-en-1-ol, during the hydrogenation process.

3. Catalysts prepared using separate metal precursors tend to have a greater amount of residual chlorides, which notably affect their catalytic activity but cause only a minor change in the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.

4. The magnesium oxide (MgO)-supported platinumtin (PtSn) alloy demonstrates superior selectivity for dehydrogenated products compared to catalysts supported on silica or alumina.

5. Increasing the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) from 673 K to 773 K leads to the removal of a significant portion of surface chlorides, which correlates with an increase in catalytic activity. However, this increase is accompanied by only a modest rise in the selectivity for the production of crotyl alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol).

2. 催化剂的主体和表面组成与其在醋酸丙烯蒸汽相氢化过程中的行为密切相关。较大尺寸的PtSn合金颗粒，具有较高表面氧化锡物种浓度，能够在氢化过程中实现最高选择性生成不饱和醇，但-2-烯-1-醇。

3. 使用单独金属前体制备的催化剂倾向于含有更多的残余氯化物，这些氯化物显著影响其催化活性，但仅轻微改变氢化羰基键的选择性。

4. 镁氧化物（MgO）支持的铂锡（PtSn）合金在脱氢产物的选择性上优于二氧化硅或氧化铝支持的催化剂。

5. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度从673 K提高到773 K导致表面氯化物的显著去除，这与催化活性的增加相关联。然而，这种增加伴随着仅适度提高的生成2-烯-1-醇（但-2-烯-1-醇）的选择性。
