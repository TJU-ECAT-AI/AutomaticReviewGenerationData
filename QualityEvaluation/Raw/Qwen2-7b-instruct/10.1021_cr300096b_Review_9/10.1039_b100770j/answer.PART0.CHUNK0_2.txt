1. Selective hydrogenation of organic molecules with multiple functional groups holds significant potential for the industrial production of fine chemicals. 

2. Among the catalysts made with larger bimetallic particles, those containing a higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species showed the highest selectivity for producing the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol).

3. Different preparation methods led to catalysts with varying properties and catalytic activities.

4. Oxidized tin species are crucial for ensuring the selectivity in hydrogenating carbonyl bonds.

5. Catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) displayed the highest selectivity, while catalyst 2PtSn(0.25) predominantly produced butanal.

6. Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) in the Pt/MgO system was initially noted by Adamiec et al. after reducing the catalyst at 773 K.

7. Increasing the reduction temperature resulted in enhanced catalytic activity.
