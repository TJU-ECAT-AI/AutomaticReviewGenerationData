[1] "The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production."
[2] "It is shown that the various preparation methods produce catalysts with distinct properties and catalytic behaviour."
[3] "For catalysts prepared with the bimetallic complex, the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol) was achieved for the catalyst containing larger bimetallic particles, which are associated with a higher surface concentration of oxidised tin species."
[4] "When tested in the skeletal reactions of n-hexane, these catalysts are highly stable and selective to dehydrogenated products."
[5] "The method followed and the metal precursors used in the preparation of catalysts clearly affect the catalytic performance."
[6] "The presence of oxidised tin species is required to ensure selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."
[7] "However, this was accompanied by only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol, as shown in Fig. 8."
[8] "Furthermore, the increase in activity of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) can be attributed to the removal of residual chlorides, which may poison surface platinum atoms."

1. Selective hydrogenation of organic molecules with multiple functional groups has significant potential for the production of fine chemicals through industrial processes. The preparation methods of catalysts impact their distinct properties and catalytic behavior.

2. Various preparation methods yield catalysts with different properties and catalytic performance.

3. Large bimetallic particles in catalysts containing PtSn alloys show the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol). This is linked to a higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species.

4. Catalysts tested in the skeletal reactions of n-hexane demonstrate high stability and selectivity for dehydrogenated products.

5. The approach and metal precursors utilized in catalyst preparation significantly influence their catalytic performance.

6. Oxidized tin species are crucial for ensuring the selectivity of the hydrogenation process of the carbonyl bond.

7. The increase in the reduction temperature leads to enhanced catalytic activity, but the selectivity for crotyl alcohol increases slightly.

8. The improvement in catalyst activity can be attributed to the removal of residual chlorides, which might poison surface platinum atoms.
