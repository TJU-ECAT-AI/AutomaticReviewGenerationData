1. The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules, especially those with multiple functional groups, is crucial for industrial processes in fine chemical production. It facilitates the creation of valuable intermediates in perfume, flavoring, and pharmaceutical synthesis.

2. The carbonyl bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes leads to the formation of unsaturated alcohols, which are key intermediates in the production of fragrances, flavors, and medicines.

3. To enhance the selectivity of the hydrogenation process for the carbonyl bond, promoting the metal is necessary. This ensures the production of unsaturated alcohols, such as crotyl alcohol or but-2-en-1-ol.

4. The platinumtin bimetallic system is widely studied for selectively hydrogenating carbonyl bonds in the presence of olefinic CC bonds. Proper coordination between oxidized and metallic or alloyed tin species is essential for achieving catalyst selectivity in this type of reaction.

5. The magnesium oxide (MgO)-supported platinumtin (PtSn) alloy demonstrates higher selectivity for dehydrogenated products compared to silica- or alumina-supported catalysts.

6. Recent studies have shown that magnesium oxide-supported platinumtin catalysts, prepared through a two-step impregnation process with Pt(acac)2 and Sn(Bu)4, exhibit high selectivity in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of citral. Monometallic Pt/MgO catalysts can achieve a selectivity of up to 70% at 100% conversion to unsaturated alcohols.

7. This research focuses on the catalytic behavior of well-characterized magnesium oxide-supported platinumtin catalysts, prepared from bimetallic complexes like cis-[PtCl(SnCl3)(PPh3)2] or monometallic complexes like cis-[PtCl2(PPh3)2] and SnCl2, in the vapor-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde.

8. The performance of these catalysts is linked to their structural and surface characteristics, as revealed through various analytical techniques.

9. Despite deactivation under reaction conditions, all catalysts were utilized effectively.

10. Increasing the reduction temperature from 673 K to 773 K for catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) leads to the removal of a significant amount of surface chlorides, which correlates with enhanced catalytic activity and only a slight improvement in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol.
