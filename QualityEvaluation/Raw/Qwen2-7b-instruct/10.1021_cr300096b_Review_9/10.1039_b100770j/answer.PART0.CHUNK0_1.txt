[1] "The selective hydrogenation of organic molecules containing several functional groups offers great potential for industrial processes of fine chemical production."
[2] "Its performance depends on the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation method and, chiefly, on the interaction between platinum and metallic and oxidised tin species."
[3] "The method followed and the metal precursors used in the preparation of catalysts clearly affect the catalytic performance."
[4] "The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts was related to the catalytic behaviour in the vapour phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (but-2-enal)."
[5] "For catalysts prepared with the bimetallic complex, the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol) was achieved for the catalyst containing larger bimetallic particles, which are associated with a higher surface concentration of oxidised tin species."
[6] "The catalyst prepared with separate metal precursors contains a higher amount of residual chlorides, which significantly affect the catalytic activity but only slightly alter the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond."
[7] "Furthermore, the support also plays a key role: the MgO-supported PtSn alloy shows higher selectivity for dehydrogenated products than silica- or alumina-supported catalysts."
[8] "Thus, the reduction of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) at a higher temperature (773 K) removes a significant amount of surface chlorides, which is paralleled by an increase in the catalytic activity, but only a slight increase in the selectivity for crotyl alcohol."

1. The hydrogenation of organic molecules with multiple functional groups provides substantial potential for the production of fine chemicals through industrial processes. The effectiveness of the hydrogenation process, particularly concerning the C═O bond, is influenced by factors including the Sn/Pt atomic ratio, the preparation technique, and the interaction between platinum and tin species. The type of metal precursors used in the catalyst preparation process significantly impacts its performance.

2. The bulk and surface composition of the catalysts are closely tied to their behavior in the vapor phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde. Larger bimetallic particles of the PtSn alloy, characterized by a higher surface concentration of oxidized tin species, yield the highest selectivity for the unsaturated alcohol, but-2-en-1-ol, during the hydrogenation process.

3. Catalysts prepared using separate metal precursors tend to have a greater amount of residual chlorides, which notably affect their catalytic activity but cause only a minor change in the selectivity for the hydrogenation of the carbonyl bond.

4. The magnesium oxide (MgO)-supported platinumtin (PtSn) alloy demonstrates superior selectivity for dehydrogenated products compared to catalysts supported on silica or alumina.

5. Increasing the reduction temperature of catalyst 2PtSn(2.5) from 673 K to 773 K leads to the removal of a significant portion of surface chlorides, which correlates with an increase in catalytic activity. However, this increase is accompanied by only a modest rise in the selectivity for the production of crotyl alcohol (but-2-en-1-ol).

1. 含有多个功能团的有机分子的氢化为精细化学品生产过程提供了巨大的潜力。氢化过程，尤其是对C═O键的影响，受Sn/Pt原子比、制备方法和铂与锡物种之间的相互作用等因素的影响。催化剂的制备过程中使用的金属前体类型显著影响其性能。

2. 催化剂的主体和表面组成与其在醋酸丙烯蒸汽相氢化过程中的行为密切相关。较大尺寸的PtSn合金颗粒，具有较高表面氧化锡物种浓度，能够在氢化过程中实现最高选择性生成不饱和醇，但-2-烯-1-醇。

3. 使用单独金属前体制备的催化剂倾向于含有更多的残余氯化物，这些氯化物显著影响其催化活性，但仅轻微改变氢化羰基键的选择性。

4. 镁氧化物（MgO）支持的铂锡（PtSn）合金在脱氢产物的选择性上优于二氧化硅或氧化铝支持的催化剂。

5. 将催化剂2PtSn(2.5)的还原温度从673 K提高到773 K导致表面氯化物的显著去除，这与催化活性的增加相关联。然而，这种增加伴随着仅适度提高的生成2-烯-1-醇（但-2-烯-1-醇）的选择性。
