[1] "Bimetallic Pt-Re catalysts have been shown to be able to reduce N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to N-methylpyrrolidine at low temperatures and moderate pressures (120 C and 20 bar H2 pressure) for the first time."
[2] "The interaction between the Pt and Re was found to be critical in forming active amide hydrogenation catalysts."
[3] "Although a range of supports was found to be effective for the hydrogenation, the use of titania was found to promote the activity of the bimetallic Pt/Re catalyst resulting in over 90% conversion and >99% selectivity to the corresponding amine after 24 h."
[4] "Density functional theory calculations clearly demonstrated that the role of the Re was to activate the CO bond, whereas the Pt aided the reduction of the ReO and enabled the formation of water and the amine."
[5] "Monometallic systems were shown not to provide the appropriate bifunctional capability."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic Pt-Re catalysts contributes to various industrial and research applications, such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, by enabling efficient and selective reduction of amides at low temperatures and pressures. The key to this process lies in the critical interaction between platinum (Pt) and rhenium (Re) metals. By employing titania (TiO2) as a support, the activity of the bimetallic catalyst is significantly enhanced, leading to over 90% conversion and greater than 99% selectivity to the corresponding amine after 24 hours. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate the mechanism, revealing that Re activates the CO bond, while Pt facilitates the reduction of ReO, enabling the formation of water and the amine. Monometallic systems, on the other hand, do not possess the necessary bifunctionality for this reaction.

利用铂（Pt）和铼（Re）双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化，对于各种工业和研究应用，如精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转换，具有重要意义。关键在于Pt与Re之间的相互作用。通过使用二氧化钛（TiO2）作为载体，双金属催化剂的活性显著增强，导致超过90%的转化率和大于99%的选择性胺在24小时内。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算揭示了这一过程的机制：Re激活CO键，而Pt促进了ReO的还原，从而形成水和胺。相比之下，单金属系统缺乏这种反应所需的双功能特性。
