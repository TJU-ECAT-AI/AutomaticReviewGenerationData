1. Catalytic hydrogenation of tertiary amides, especially N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, can be efficiently carried out at low temperatures and pressures using bimetallic Pt/Re-based catalysts on a TiO2 support. The key to the high activity is the close interaction between the rhenium (Re) and platinum (Pt) components. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that rhenium activates the CO bond while platinum acts as a hydrogenation catalyst, removing intermediates from the catalyst surface. The presence of oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 support enhances the rate by facilitating adsorption and weakening the CO bond.

2. Bimetallic PtRe catalysts enable the hydrogenation of amides under mild conditions, offering potential for various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The synergy between Pt and Re is crucial for the high activity of the catalyst, and DFT calculations elucidate the roles of each metal. The Pt facilitates hydrogenation, while the uncoordinated Re activates the CO bond.

3. The use of bimetallic PtRe catalysts on TiO2 support promotes the activity of the catalyst, achieving over 90% conversion and >99% selectivity to the corresponding amine after 24 hours. This is due to the close interaction between Pt and Re, which activates the CO bond, and the Pt facilitates the removal of intermediates, thus enhancing the efficiency of the hydrogenation process.

4. The DFT calculations reveal that the rhenium (Re) metal plays a critical role in activating the CO bond, whereas the platinum (Pt) metal acts as a hydrogenation catalyst, removing intermediates from the catalyst surface. The synergy between Pt and Re enables efficient hydrogenation of amides under mild conditions, demonstrating the potential for broad applications in chemical synthesis and conversion processes.
