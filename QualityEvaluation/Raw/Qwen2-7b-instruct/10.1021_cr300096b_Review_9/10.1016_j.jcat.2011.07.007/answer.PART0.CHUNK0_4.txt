[1] "PtRe bimetallic catalysts have been shown to be able to reduce N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to N-methylpyrrolidine at low temperatures and moderate pressures (120 C and 20 bar H2 pressure) for the first time."
[2] "The interaction between the Pt and Re was found to be critical in forming active amide hydrogenation catalysts."
[3] "Although a range of supports was found to be effective for the hydrogenation, the use of titania was found to promote the activity of the bimetallic Pt/Re catalyst resulting in over 90% conversion and >99% selectivity to the corresponding amine after 24 h."
[4] "Density functional theory calculations clearly demonstrated that the role of the Re was to activate the CO bond, whereas the Pt aided the reduction of the ReO and enabled the formation of water and the amine."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Re systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process enables the efficient and selective conversion of amides into amines under mild conditions, which is advantageous for the production of various organic compounds. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve both theoretical and experimental approaches. Theoretical studies often utilize computational chemistry tools, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, to understand the mechanisms involved and predict the most effective catalyst compositions and conditions. Experimentally, researchers test a range of catalysts, conditions, and supports to identify the optimal parameters for the hydrogenation process. The role of the Pt and Re metals in these catalysts is critical, with Re activating the C═O bond and Pt facilitating the hydrogenation of intermediates, including the removal of oxygen from the catalyst surface to form water and the desired amine product.

In this context, the use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a support promotes the activity of the bimetallic Pt-Re catalyst, leading to high conversions and selectivities towards the amine product. The synergistic interaction between the Pt and Re metals on the TiO2 surface enhances the catalytic performance, making the process suitable for the hydrogenation of tertiary amides at low temperatures and pressures. This approach not only reduces the environmental impact associated with high-temperature and high-pressure conditions but also facilitates the efficient production of amines, which are widely used in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and personal care products.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用如铂-铼双金属催化剂系统这样的双金属催化剂，在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域中发挥着重要作用。该过程允许在温和条件下高效选择性地将酰胺转化为胺，这在生产各种有机化合物方面具有优势。用于研究、优化和提高此过程的选择性和效率的方法涉及理论和实验两个方面。理论研究通常利用计算化学工具，如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，来理解所涉及的机制并预测最有效的催化剂组成和条件。实验上，研究人员测试一系列催化剂、条件和支持物，以确定氢化过程的最佳参数。铂和铼金属在这类催化剂中的作用至关重要，铼激活C═O键，而铂促进中间体的氢化，包括从催化剂表面去除氧以形成水和所需的胺产品。

在这种情况下，使用二氧化钛（TiO2）作为支持物可以促进双金属铂-铼催化剂的活性，导致高转化率和对胺产品的高选择性。铂和铼金属在TiO2表面上的协同相互作用提高了催化剂性能，使得在低温低压条件下进行酰胺氢化成为可能。这种方法不仅减少了与高温高压条件相关的环境影响，而且还促进了胺的高效生产，这些胺广泛应用于制药、农用化学品和化妆品等行业。
