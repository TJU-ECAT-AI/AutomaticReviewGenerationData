[1] "Bimetallic PtRe catalysts have been shown to be able to reduce N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one to N-methylpyrrolidine at low temperatures and moderate pressures (120 C and 20 bar H2 pressure) for the first time."
[2] "Although a range of supports was found to be effective for the hydrogenation, the use of titania was found to promote the activity of the bimetallic Pt/Re catalyst resulting in over 90% conversion and >99% selectivity to the corresponding amine after 24 h."
[3] "Density functional theory calculations clearly demonstrated that the role of the Re was to activate the CO bond, whereas the Pt aided the reduction of the ReO and enabled the formation of water and the amine."

The catalytic hydrogenation of tertiary amides, specifically N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one, has been successfully facilitated by bimetallic Pt/Re catalysts at low temperatures and pressures for the first time. This process enables the reduction of the amide to form the corresponding amine with high efficiency, achieving over 90% conversion and >99% selectivity within 24 hours. Titania supports were found to significantly enhance the activity of the Pt/Re catalysts. The DFT calculations elucidate that the rhenium (Re) metal plays a crucial role in activating the C=O bond, while the platinum (Pt) facilitates the reduction of ReO, contributing to the formation of water and the amine. Monometallic catalysts were not found to possess the necessary bifunctional capability for this hydrogenation process.

首次通过双金属Pt/Re催化剂在低温和中等压力（120°C和20巴氢气压力）下，实现了N-甲基吡咯烷-2-酮的催化氢化，将其转化为相应的胺。这一过程在24小时内实现了超过90%的转化率和>99%的选择性。发现二氧化钛支持材料可以显著提高Pt/Re催化剂的活性。密度泛函理论计算表明，Re的作用是激活C=O键，而Pt则有助于还原ReO，并促进水和胺的形成。单一金属催化剂未能提供此氢化过程所需的双功能能力。
