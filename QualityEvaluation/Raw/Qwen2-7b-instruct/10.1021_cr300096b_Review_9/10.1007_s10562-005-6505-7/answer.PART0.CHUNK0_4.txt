[1] "Diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction studies suggest that Pt and Re segregation occurs during the reaction."
[2] "The segregation results in an increase in the Pt sites available for CH4 decomposition and results in the bimetallic catalyst exhibiting an increase in the conversion of methane with time on stream."
[3] "After 20 h of reaction, the CH4 conversion observed for the bimetallic catalyst was the same as the CH4 conversion observed for the monometallic catalyst."

Catalysis Letters published a study on the segregation of Pt and Re during CO2 reforming of CH4. This process leads to an increase in the Pt sites available for CH4 decomposition, resulting in a higher conversion rate of methane over time compared to monometallic catalysts. This demonstrates the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the conversion of methane.

《催化信函》发表了一项关于在CO2重整CH4过程中Pt和Re的分离的研究。这一过程导致了可用于CH4分解的Pt位点数量增加，结果是双金属催化剂在流体时间内的甲烷转化率高于单金属催化剂。这证明了双金属催化剂在提高甲烷转化率方面的有效性。
