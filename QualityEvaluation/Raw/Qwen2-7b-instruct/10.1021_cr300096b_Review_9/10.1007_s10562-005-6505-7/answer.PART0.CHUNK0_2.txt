[1] "PtRe supported on Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2 was studied for the carbon dioxide reforming of methane at 800 C."
[2] "Diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction studies suggest that Pt and Re segregation occurs during the reaction."
[3] "The segregation results in an increase in the Pt sites available for CH4 decomposition and results in the bimetallic catalyst exhibiting an increase in the conversion of methane with time on stream."
[4] "After 20 h of reaction, the CH4 conversion observed for the bimetallic catalyst was the same as the CH4 conversion observed for the monometallic catalyst."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enhancing the conversion of methane through improved selectivity and efficiency. In the study of PtRe supported on Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2 for carbon dioxide reforming of methane at 800°C, it was found that segregation of Pt and Re occurs during the reaction. This segregation leads to an increase in the availability of Pt sites for CH4 decomposition, resulting in a higher conversion rate of methane over time. Notably, after 20 hours of reaction, the methane conversion observed for the bimetallic catalyst matched that of the monometallic catalyst, indicating the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in this context.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用如Pt-Ni体系的双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用如精细化学合成和木质素生物质转换做出了贡献，通过提高选择性和效率增强了甲烷的转化。在对Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2支持的PtRe进行二氧化碳重整甲烷研究时，在800°C下发现Pt和Re在反应过程中发生分离。这种分离导致可用于CH4分解的Pt位点增加，从而导致双金属催化剂表现出随时间增加的甲烷转化率。值得注意的是，在20小时的反应后，与单金属催化剂相比，双金属催化剂观察到的甲烷转化率相同，这表明双金属催化剂在这种情况下非常有效。
