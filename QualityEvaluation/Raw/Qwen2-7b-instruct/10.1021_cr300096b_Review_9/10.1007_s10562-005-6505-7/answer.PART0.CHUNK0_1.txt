[1] "Diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction studies suggest that Pt and Re segregation occurs during the reaction."
[2] "The segregation results in an increase in the Pt sites available for CH4 decomposition and results in the bimetallic catalyst exhibiting an increase in the conversion of methane with time on stream."
[3] "After 20 h of reaction, the CH4 conversion observed for the bimetallic catalyst was the same as the CH4 conversion observed for the monometallic catalyst."

Catalysis Letters focuses on the study of catalytic processes, specifically examining the segregation of Pt and Re during the carbon dioxide reforming of methane. These studies suggest that the segregation enhances the availability of Pt sites for the decomposition of methane, leading to an increased conversion rate of methane over time. This outcome is comparable to the conversion rate observed with a monometallic catalyst, indicating the effectiveness of bimetallic catalysts in enhancing the efficiency of the reaction.
