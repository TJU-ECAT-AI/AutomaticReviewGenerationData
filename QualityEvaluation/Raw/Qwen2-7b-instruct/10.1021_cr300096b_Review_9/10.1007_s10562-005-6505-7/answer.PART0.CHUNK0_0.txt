[1] "PtRe supported on Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2 was studied for the carbon dioxide reforming of methane at 800 C."
[2] "Diffuse reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction studies suggest that Pt and Re segregation occurs during the reaction."
[3] "The segregation results in an increase in the Pt sites available for CH4 decomposition and results in the bimetallic catalyst exhibiting an increase in the conversion of methane with time on stream."
[4] "After 20 h of reaction, the CH4 conversion observed for the bimetallic catalyst was the same as the CH4 conversion observed for the monometallic catalyst."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for enhanced selectivity and efficiency in converting feedstocks into desired products. Studies employing methodologies such as diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed reduction have revealed that during the reaction, segregation of metals like Pt and Re occurs on the catalyst surface. This segregation increases the availability of active sites for the decomposition of molecules like methane, leading to improved conversion rates over time. For instance, in the case of Pt-Re supported on Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2, the bimetallic catalyst demonstrated comparable methane conversion efficiency to a monometallic catalyst after 20 hours of reaction.

使用如Pt-Ni这样的双金属催化剂进行C═O键的催化氢化，在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业与研究应用中起着重要作用。此过程能够提高选择性和效率，将原料转化为所需产品。采用如差分反射傅里叶变换红外光谱法和温度程序还原等方法的研究表明，在反应过程中，Pt和Re等金属在催化剂表面发生分离。这种分离增加了分子（如甲烷）分解的活性位点数量，导致催化剂表现出随时间增加而增强的转化率。例如，在Ce0.52 Zr0.48 O2支持下的Pt-Re催化剂中，双金属催化剂在20小时反应后观察到的甲烷转化效率与单金属催化剂相同。
