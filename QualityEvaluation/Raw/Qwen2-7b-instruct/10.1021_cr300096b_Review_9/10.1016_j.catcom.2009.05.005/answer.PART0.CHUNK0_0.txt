<p>Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications.</p>
<p>The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase. The industrial process is conducted at high temperature and pressure, employing a CuCr catalyst, which exhibits a moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid-phase has been widely studied using catalysts based on Ni, Co, Ru and Pd, sometimes with the addition of a second metal or a promoter to improve the activity and/or the selectivity.</p>
<p>Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds.</p>
<p>When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol. The most efficient system was the catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3).</p>

1. Furfuryl alcohol, the product of furfural hydrogenation, is widely utilized in the chemical industry, serving as an additive or solvent in resin production, and as an intermediate in the synthesis of lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersants, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol.
2. The industrial hydrogenation process of furfural is typically carried out at high temperatures and pressures, using a CuCr catalyst that demonstrates moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol.
3. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural has been extensively explored with catalysts like Ni, Co, Ru, and Pd, often enhanced with a secondary metal or promoter for improved activity and selectivity.
4. Our previous research group studies revealed that incorporating Sn into Pt-based catalysts results in more effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of diverse unsaturated carbonyl compounds.
5. After sequential hydrogenation reactions, bimetallic catalysts exhibited a slight deactivation (25% from the first to the third cycle), yet they remained highly selective for furfuryl alcohol. The most efficient catalyst was the one with the least Sn content (PtSn0.3).

1. 葡萄糖醇，由糠醛氢化得到的主要产物，在化工行业中被广泛应用，用作不同特性的树脂添加剂或溶剂。它还用作制造赖氨酸、维生素C、润滑剂、分散剂和四氢糠醇等的化学中间体。
2. 糠醛的工业氢化过程通常在高温高压下进行，使用CuCr催化剂，该催化剂对葡萄糖醇表现出适度的活性。
3. 对于液相糠醛氢化，已广泛研究使用Ni、Co、Ru和Pd为基础的催化剂，有时添加第二种金属或促进剂以提高活性和选择性。
4. 我们的研究小组先前的研究表明，将Sn添加到Pt基催化剂中可导致更有效的催化剂用于氢化多种不饱和羰基化合物。
5. 在连续氢化反应后，双金属催化剂显示出一定程度的失活（从第一次到第三次循环的25%），但它们仍然对葡萄糖醇具有高度的选择性。最有效的催化剂是Sn含量最低的（PtSn0.3）。
