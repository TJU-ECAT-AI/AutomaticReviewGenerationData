[1] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry."
[2] "One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics."
[3] "It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications."
[4] "Due to the wide variety of compounds available, it is attractive to design systems that are highly selective to the desired product, furfuryl alcohol."
[5] "The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase."
[6] "With this type of catalyst, Vannice et al. found that the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol over copper chromite pretreated at 573 K was 70% for 64% of furfural converted."
[7] "The main drawback of this system is the toxicity of the catalyst, due to the presence of Cr2O3, which may have important consequences for the environment."
[8] "Hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid-phase has been widely studied using catalysts based on Ni, Co, Ru and Pd."
[9] "In this sense, systems based on Ni or Co modified with Cu, Fe, Ce or heteropolyacids have proved to be very successful, reaching 98% selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol, at almost total conversion."
[10] "However, in some cases, the main disadvantage is that the catalyst cannot be reused."
[11] "Pt-based catalysts have been much less employed, so little information is available in the open literature."
[12] "The systems most commonly used are Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3."
[13] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds."
[14] "In this paper, we propose the systematic study of the effect of tin content on the activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 that are employed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol."
[15] "In order to obtain well-defined bimetallic phases, surface-controlled reactions were used in the preparation of the catalysts."
[16] "The content of Sn fixed in each bimetallic catalyst was obtained by chromatographic analysis of the solution containing the organometallic compound, as a function of reaction time."
[17] "The metal particle size distribution of all catalysts used was measured by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)."
[18] "The results of conversion as a function of reaction time for the hydrogenation of furfural, using 2-propanol as solvent, are reported in Fig. 2."
[19] "The results of selectivity to different hydrogenation products of furfural, after 8 h of reaction, are gathered in Table 2."
[20] "The nature of the solvent can influence the kinetics of competitive hydrogenation reactions of both polar and non-polar substrates: it has been found that a polar solvent enhances adsorption of the non-polar reactant while a non-polar solvent enhances the adsorption of a polar reactant."
[21] "A general problem encountered in the hydrogenation of aldehydes using an alcohol as solvent is the formation of secondary products of the type of acetals, due to a reaction between the substrate and the solvent."
[22] "This observation is consistent with that reported for other systems used in the hydrogenation of furfural, which suggests that there may be a catalyst poisoning due to the adsorption of furfural and/or any of the reaction products on the active metal."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. For instance, furfuryl alcohol, produced from furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry for resin production, as an additive or solvent. It is also used in the manufacture of lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. Designing selective systems for furfuryl alcohol is attractive due to the wide variety of available compounds. The hydrogenation of furfural can be carried out in liquid or vapor phase, with varying catalyst selectivities and drawbacks. Liquid-phase hydrogenation using catalysts like Ni, Co, Ru, and Pd has been widely studied, showing high selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol. However, catalysts like copper chromium may have environmental concerns due to toxicity. Pt-based catalysts are less employed, with information scarcity in the open literature. Addition of Sn to Pt-based systems has shown promise in enhancing efficiency for the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In the study, the effect of tin content on activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 was systematically investigated for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Surface-controlled reactions were utilized for catalyst preparation, and Sn content was determined through chromatographic analysis. TEM was used to measure metal particle size distribution. Conversion and selectivity were evaluated, revealing that PtSn systems were more active than monometallic catalysts, with PtSn0.3 being the most efficient. Stability tests showed that although all systems exhibited some deactivation, PtSn0.3 maintained high conversion levels across three hydrogenation cycles, demonstrating enhanced selectivity to furfuryl alcohol.

2. Solvent effects in heterogeneous catalysis have been rationalized by correlating reaction rates and product distributions with solvent polarity or dielectric constant. Polar solvents enhance adsorption of non-polar substrates, while non-polar solvents enhance adsorption of polar substrates. This can influence the kinetics of competitive hydrogenation reactions of both polar and non-polar substrates. A polar solvent enhances adsorption of the non-polar reactant, whereas a non-polar solvent enhances the adsorption of a polar reactant. In the context of the study, the use of toluene and n-heptane led to slower reaction rates compared to 2-propanol, likely due to the adsorption of the polar substrate in the non-polar solvents. The authors also noted the absence of products of acetylation between furfural and the alcohol used as solvent, indicating an advantage of the proposed catalytic systems in avoiding unwanted side reactions.

1. 使用如铂-镍双金属催化剂系统，在液相中选择性氢化糠醛以制备糠醇的催化作用，对于精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究应用具有重要意义。例如，由糠醛制得的糠醇在化学工业中广泛用于树脂生产，作为添加剂或溶剂。它还用于赖氨酸、维生素C、润滑剂、分散剂和四氢糠醇的制造。设计对目标产物糠醇高度选择性的系统具有吸引力，因为有多种可用化合物。糠醛的氢化可以进行液相或气相，具有不同的催化剂选择性和缺点。液相氢化使用如镍、钴、钌和钯等催化剂体系已广泛研究，显示出对不饱和醇的高选择性。然而，铜铬催化剂可能因毒性而存在环境问题。铂基催化剂的使用较少，开放文献中的信息有限。向铂基系统添加锡已被证明能提高许多不同不饱和羰基化合物的氢化效率。在本研究中，探讨了锡含量对液相氢化糠醛制备糠醇的Pt/SiO2催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性的系统影响。表面控制反应用于催化剂的制备，通过色谱法分析溶液中有机金属化合物随反应时间的变化来确定锡含量。透射电子显微镜（TEM）用于测量所有催化剂的金属颗粒尺寸分布。根据反应时间对糠醛氢化进行了评估，结果表明，PtSn系统比单金属催化剂更活跃，其中PtSn0.3最为有效。稳定性测试显示，尽管所有系统都表现出一定程度的失活，但PtSn0.3在三次氢化周期内保持了较高的转化率，显示了对糠醇的高度选择性。

2. 不同溶剂在异质催化中的作用已被通过将反应速率和产物分布与溶剂极性和介电常数的相关性来合理化。极性溶剂增强非极性底物的吸附，而非极性溶剂增强极性底物的吸附。这可以影响竞争性氢化反应中极性和非极性底物的反应动力学。使用极性溶剂增强非极性反应物的吸附，而使用非极性溶剂增强极性反应物的吸附。在本研究的背景下，使用甲苯和庚烷导致反应速率相对于丙醇较慢，可能是因为非极性溶剂中极性底物的吸附。作者还注意到，没有发现糠醛和作为溶剂使用的醇之间的乙酰化产品，这表明所提出的催化系统在避免不希望的副反应方面具有优势。
