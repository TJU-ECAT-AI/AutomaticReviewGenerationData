          [1] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry."
          [2] "Due to the wide variety of compounds available, it is attractive to design systems that are highly selective to the desired product, furfuryl alcohol."
          [3] "The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase."
          [4] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds."
          [5] "When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol."

          The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, especially those with the lowest tin content, show high selectivity and efficiency in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. These catalysts allow achieving a high yield of furfuryl alcohol, with selectivities ranging from 96% to 98%. When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but they still maintain high selectivity to furfuryl alcohol.

          使用如铂-镍双金属催化剂系统，在液相中选择性氢化糠醛以制备糠醇的催化作用，对于精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究应用具有重要意义。含锡量最低的PtSn双金属催化剂尤其显示出高选择性和效率，在糠醛氢化为糠醇的过程中。这些催化剂能够实现高产率的糠醇，选择性范围在96%至98%之间。在连续氢化反应中，双金属催化剂表现出一定的失活（从第一轮到第三轮的25%），但它们仍然保持对糠醇的高度选择性。

          [6] "The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase."
          [7] "The industrial process is conducted at high temperature and pressure, employing a CuCr catalyst, which exhibits a moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol."
          [8] "Hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid-phase has been widely studied using catalysts based on Ni, Co, Ru and Pd, sometimes with the addition of a second metal or a promoter to improve the activity and/or the selectivity."
          [9] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds."
          [10] "The results of conversion as a function of reaction time for the hydrogenation of furfural, using 2-propanol as solvent, are reported in Fig. 2."

          Hydrogenation of furfural can occur in either liquid or vapor phase. Industrially, this process is carried out under high temperature and pressure conditions using a CuCr catalyst, which shows moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural has been extensively researched with catalysts including Ni, Co, Ru, and Pd, sometimes enhanced with additional metals or promoters to boost activity and/or selectivity. Our research group's past studies have demonstrated that adding Sn to Pt-based systems yields more effective catalysts for the hydrogenation of numerous unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The conversion rate over time for the hydrogenation of furfural, using 2-propanol as the solvent, is depicted in Figure 2.

          糠醛的氢化可以在液相或气相中进行。工业上，该过程在高温高压条件下使用CuCr催化剂进行，该催化剂对糠醇表现出适度的活性。液相糠醛氢化已被广泛研究，使用如Ni、Co、Ru、Pd等催化剂，有时添加额外的金属或促进剂以提高活性和/或选择性。我们研究小组过去的研究表明，将Sn添加到Pt基系统中可产生更有效的催化剂，用于氢化多种不饱和羰基化合物。使用2-丙醇作为溶剂，糠醛氢化的转化率随时间变化的情况在图2中有所体现。
