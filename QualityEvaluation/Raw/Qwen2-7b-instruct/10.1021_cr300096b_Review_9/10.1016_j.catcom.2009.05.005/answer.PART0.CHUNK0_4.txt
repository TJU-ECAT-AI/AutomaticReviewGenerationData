[1] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications [1] ,[2] ,[3]."
[2] "The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase. The industrial process is conducted at high temperature and pressure, employing a CuCr catalyst, which exhibits a moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol [5] ,[6] ,[7]."
[3] "Hydrogenation of furfural in the liquid-phase has been widely studied using catalysts based on Ni, Co, Ru and Pd, sometimes with the addition of a second metal or a promoter to improve the activity and/or the selectivity [2] ,[8]."
[4] "The systems most commonly used are Pt/C and Pt/Al2O3 [2] ,[8]. One of the main problems in the application of Pt-based catalysts in the hydrogenation of furfural is the often observed side reactions (hydrogenolysis of the CO bond, decarbonylation, hydrogenation and furan ring opening, etc.), which decrease the selectivity to the desired product."
[5] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds [14] ,[15]."
[6] "In this paper, we propose the systematic study of the effect of tin content on the activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 that are employed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol."
[7] "The content of Sn fixed in each bimetallic catalyst was obtained by chromatographic analysis of the solution containing the organometallic compound, as a function of reaction time, using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph, equipped with a capillary column FactorFour CP8907 (VF-1 ms, 15 m × 0.25 mm i.d., DF = 0.25) and a FID detector."
[8] "The results of conversion as a function of reaction time for the hydrogenation of furfural, using 2-propanol as solvent, are reported in Fig. 2."
[9] "The results of selectivity to different hydrogenation products of furfural, after 8 h of reaction, are gathered in Table 2."
[10] "Solvent effects in heterogeneous catalysis have been rationalized by correlating reaction rates and product distributions with solvent polarity or dielectric constant (ε) [23]."
[11] "A general problem encountered in the hydrogenation of aldehydes using an alcohol as solvent is the formation of secondary products of the type of acetals, due to a reaction between the substrate and the solvent [25]."
[12] "A valuable property of heterogeneous catalysts, in addition to their activity and selectivity, is the possibility to reuse them, looking forward to their practical application. Therefore, stability tests were performed on some of the studied systems, choosing 2-propanol as solvent."
[13] "As shown, in the first cycle the monometallic catalyst reached a conversion of 46% at 480 min of reaction, while for the same time elapsed, in the second and third cycles a conversion of 30% was reached."

1. Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry for the production of resins, manufacturing of lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents, and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. Liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural is a common practice in the industry, using catalysts like CuCr, Ni, Co, Ru, Pd, and their combinations to improve activity and selectivity. However, these catalysts often suffer from side reactions that decrease the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. Adding tin to platinum-based catalysts has been shown to improve their efficiency in hydrogenating various unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The authors propose a systematic study of the effect of tin content on the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Chromatographic analysis was used to determine the content of tin in each bimetallic catalyst. The results showed that the PtSn catalysts had higher activity than the monometallic catalysts, especially when the tin-to-platinum atomic ratio was lower. Stability tests showed that the PtSn0.3 catalyst maintained a high level of conversion after three hydrogenation cycles, indicating its potential for practical application.

2. In the hydrogenation of furfural, a general problem is the formation of secondary products like acetals due to reactions between the substrate and the solvent. However, the Pt-based catalysts used in this study did not show signs of such reactions, indicating an advantage of these catalysts over others.

3. The stability tests revealed that the Pt/SiO2 catalyst suffered a certain deactivation in subsequent cycles of hydrogenation, reaching a conversion of 30% after the third cycle. In contrast, the PtSn0.3 catalyst maintained a high level of conversion even after three cycles, showing its potential for practical use in the hydrogenation of furfural.

1. 焦基醇，通过糠醛的氢化的主要产物，在化学工业中被广泛应用于不同特性的树脂生产。它还被用作制造赖氨酸、维生素C、润滑剂、分散剂和四氢糠基醇等中间体。液相氢化是工业实践中常见的做法，使用如铜铬、镍、钴、钌和钯等催化剂及其组合来提高活性和选择性。然而，这些催化剂常伴随着CO键氢解、脱羰化、氢化和呋喃环开裂等副反应，导致对焦基醇的选择性降低。将锡添加到铂基催化剂中已被证明可以提高它们在氢化多种不饱和羰基化合物方面的效率。本文作者提出系统研究锡含量对铂/SiO2催化剂改性后SnBu4用于液相糠醛氢化到焦基醇的效果。通过气相色谱法分析溶液中有机金属化合物随反应时间的变化，确定了每个双金属催化剂中的锡含量。结果表明，PtSn催化剂比单金属催化剂具有更高的活性，尤其是当锡/铂原子比较低时。稳定性测试显示，PtSn0.3催化剂在三个氢化周期后仍能保持高转化率，表明其在实际应用中的潜力。

2. 在糠醛氢化过程中，一个普遍的问题是由于溶剂与底物之间的反应形成二甲醚类副产品。然而，本文使用的铂基催化剂并未显示出此类反应的迹象，这表明这些催化剂相对于其他催化剂的优势。

3. 稳定性测试揭示了Pt/SiO2催化剂在后续氢化周期中遭受了一定程度的失活，第三轮后转化率为30%。相比之下，PtSn0.3催化剂即使在三个循环后仍能维持较高的转化率，显示了其在糠醛氢化中的潜在实用性。
