[1] "Furfuryl alcohol, the main product from the hydrogenation of furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry. One of its main uses is as an additive or solvent in the production of resins of different characteristics. It is also used as a chemical intermediate to manufacture lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents and to obtain tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, among other applications [1] ,[2] ,[3] ."
[2] "In this sense, systems based on Ni or Co modified with Cu, Fe, Ce or heteropolyacids have proved to be very successful, reaching 98% selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol, at almost total conversion [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ."
[3] "However, in some cases, the main disadvantage is that the catalyst cannot be reused [9] ."
[4] "Previous studies conducted in our research group have shown that the addition of Sn to Pt-based systems leads to more efficient catalysts in the hydrogenation of many different unsaturated carbonyl compounds [14] ,[15] ."
[5] "The results of selectivity to different hydrogenation products of furfural, after 8 h of reaction, are gathered in Table 2 . As can be seen, all the catalysts used are highly selective to the desired product, furfuryl alcohol."
[6] "In each experience, after completing a hydrogenation test, the catalyst was washed with solvent and used again, completing three cycles of hydrogenation. The results of the conversion of furfural after 480 min of reaction, for three of the systems studied, are reported in Fig. 4 . As shown, in the first cycle the monometallic catalyst reached a conversion of 46% at 480 min of reaction, while for the same time elapsed, in the second and third cycles a conversion of 30% was reached."

1. Furfuryl alcohol, derived from furfural hydrogenation, is widely utilized in the chemical industry. Its primary applications include serving as an additive or solvent in resin production and as a chemical intermediary for the synthesis of lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol.

2. Systems utilizing nickel (Ni) or cobalt (Co) modified with copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cerium (Ce), or heteropolyacids have proven effective, achieving 98% selectivity in the production of unsaturated alcohols with near-total conversion.

3. A significant limitation of these catalysts is their inability to be reused after initial application.

4. Our research group's previous studies have indicated that incorporating tin (Sn) into platinum (Pt)-based systems enhances their efficiency in the hydrogenation of various unsaturated carbonyl compounds.

5. All catalysts used in the study demonstrated high selectivity for the desired product, furfuryl alcohol, in the hydrogenation of furfural.

6. Stability tests revealed that after completing a hydrogenation test, the catalysts could be washed with solvent and reused for three consecutive cycles. The first cycle saw a 46% conversion of furfural after 480 minutes, whereas the second and third cycles achieved a conversion of 30%.

1. 来自糠醛氢化的产品糠醇在化学工业中被广泛应用。它的主要用途包括作为不同特性的树脂添加剂或溶剂，以及作为制造赖氨酸、维生素C、润滑剂、分散剂和四氢糠醇等的化学中间体。

2. 利用镍（Ni）或钴（Co）改性铜（Cu）、铁（Fe）、铈（Ce）或杂多酸的系统已证明非常成功，能够在接近完全转化的情况下达到98%的不饱和醇选择性。

3. 这些催化剂的主要缺点是无法在初次应用后重复使用。

4. 我们的先前研究显示，将锡（Sn）添加到铂（Pt）基系统中可以提高其在多种不饱和羰基化合物氢化中的效率。

5. 所有用于研究的催化剂在糠醛氢化过程中都显示出对目标产物糠醇的高度选择性。

6. 稳定性测试表明，在完成氢化测试后，催化剂可以用水洗并重复使用三次。第一次循环在480分钟后实现了46%的糠醛转化率，而第二和第三次循环的转化率则为30%。
