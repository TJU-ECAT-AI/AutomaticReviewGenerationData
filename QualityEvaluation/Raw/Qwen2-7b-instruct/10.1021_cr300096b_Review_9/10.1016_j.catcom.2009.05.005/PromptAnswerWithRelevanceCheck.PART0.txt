1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. For instance, furfuryl alcohol, produced from furfural, is widely employed in the chemical industry for resin production, as an additive or solvent. It is also used in the manufacture of lysine, vitamin C, lubricants, dispersing agents, and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. Designing selective systems for furfuryl alcohol is attractive due to the wide variety of available compounds. The hydrogenation of furfural can be carried out in liquid or vapor phase, with varying catalyst selectivities and drawbacks. Liquid-phase hydrogenation using catalysts like Ni, Co, Ru, and Pd has been widely studied, showing high selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol. However, catalysts like copper chromium may have environmental concerns due to toxicity. Pt-based catalysts are less employed, with information scarcity in the open literature. Addition of Sn to Pt-based systems has shown promise in enhancing efficiency for the hydrogenation of unsaturated carbonyl compounds. In the study, the effect of tin content on activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 was systematically investigated for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Surface-controlled reactions were utilized for catalyst preparation, and Sn content was determined through chromatographic analysis. TEM was used to measure metal particle size distribution. Conversion and selectivity were evaluated, revealing that PtSn systems were more active than monometallic catalysts, with PtSn0.3 being the most efficient. Stability tests showed that although all systems exhibited some deactivation, PtSn0.3 maintained high conversion levels across three hydrogenation cycles, demonstrating enhanced selectivity to furfuryl alcohol.

2. Solvent effects in heterogeneous catalysis have been rationalized by correlating reaction rates and product distributions with solvent polarity or dielectric constant. Polar solvents enhance adsorption of non-polar substrates, while non-polar solvents enhance adsorption of polar substrates. This can influence the kinetics of competitive hydrogenation reactions of both polar and non-polar substrates. A polar solvent enhances adsorption of the non-polar reactant, whereas a non-polar solvent enhances the adsorption of a polar reactant. In the context of the study, the use of toluene and n-heptane led to slower reaction rates compared to 2-propanol, likely due to the adsorption of the polar substrate in the non-polar solvents. The authors also noted the absence of products of acetylation between furfural and the alcohol used as solvent, indicating an advantage of the proposed catalytic systems in avoiding unwanted side reactions.

1. 使用如铂-镍双金属催化剂系统，在液相中选择性氢化糠醛以制备糠醇的催化作用，对于精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究应用具有重要意义。例如，由糠醛制得的糠醇在化学工业中广泛用于树脂生产，作为添加剂或溶剂。它还用于赖氨酸、维生素C、润滑剂、分散剂和四氢糠醇的制造。设计对目标产物糠醇高度选择性的系统具有吸引力，因为有多种可用化合物。糠醛的氢化可以进行液相或气相，具有不同的催化剂选择性和缺点。液相氢化使用如镍、钴、钌和钯等催化剂体系已广泛研究，显示出对不饱和醇的高选择性。然而，铜铬催化剂可能因毒性而存在环境问题。铂基催化剂的使用较少，开放文献中的信息有限。向铂基系统添加锡已被证明能提高许多不同不饱和羰基化合物的氢化效率。在本研究中，探讨了锡含量对液相氢化糠醛制备糠醇的Pt/SiO2催化剂活性、选择性和稳定性的系统影响。表面控制反应用于催化剂的制备，通过色谱法分析溶液中有机金属化合物随反应时间的变化来确定锡含量。透射电子显微镜（TEM）用于测量所有催化剂的金属颗粒尺寸分布。根据反应时间对糠醛氢化进行了评估，结果表明，PtSn系统比单金属催化剂更活跃，其中PtSn0.3最为有效。稳定性测试显示，尽管所有系统都表现出一定程度的失活，但PtSn0.3在三次氢化周期内保持了较高的转化率，显示了对糠醇的高度选择性。

2. 不同溶剂在异质催化中的作用已被通过将反应速率和产物分布与溶剂极性和介电常数的相关性来合理化。极性溶剂增强非极性底物的吸附，而非极性溶剂增强极性底物的吸附。这可以影响竞争性氢化反应中极性和非极性底物的反应动力学。使用极性溶剂增强非极性反应物的吸附，而使用非极性溶剂增强极性反应物的吸附。在本研究的背景下，使用甲苯和庚烷导致反应速率相对于丙醇较慢，可能是因为非极性溶剂中极性底物的吸附。作者还注意到，没有发现糠醛和作为溶剂使用的醇之间的乙酰化产品，这表明所提出的催化系统在避免不希望的副反应方面具有优势。

Bimetallic PtSn catalysts, containing different amounts of tin, were obtained by means of controlled surface reactions and used in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural. All the studied systems allowed to obtain fufuryl alcohol with high selectivity (9698%).

When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol. The most efficient system was the catalyst with the lowest tin content (PtSn0.3).

The hydrogenation of furfural has been carried out in either liquid or vapor phase. The industrial process is conducted at high temperature and pressure, employing a CuCr catalyst, which exhibits a moderate activity towards furfuryl alcohol.

Nonalcoholic and non-polar solvents caused a drastic activity decrease.

In this paper, we propose the systematic study of the effect of tin content on the activity, selectivity and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 that are employed in the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol.

The results of conversion as a function of reaction time for the hydrogenation of furfural, using 2-propanol as solvent, are reported in Fig. 2. From the analysis of this figure it can be seen that PtSn systems have a higher activity than the corresponding monometallic catalyst.

All the catalysts used are highly selective to the desired product, furfuryl alcohol. In addition, tin-modified catalysts allowed obtaining higher conversions than the Pt/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. 2).

The study of the stability of the catalysts used in the hydrogenation of furfural in 2-propanol showed that, although there is some deactivation in all the systems, the catalyst PtSn0.3 gave a high level of conversion after three reaction cycles. Besides, the selectivity to unsaturated alcohol was kept during the three hydrogenation cycles.

1. The bimetallic PtSn catalysts, especially those with the lowest tin content, show high selectivity and efficiency in the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. These catalysts allow achieving a high yield of furfuryl alcohol, with selectivities ranging from 96% to 98%. 

2. The bimetallic PtSn catalysts exhibit some deactivation over multiple cycles, but the PtSn0.3 catalyst maintains a high level of conversion and selectivity to furfuryl alcohol, even after three consecutive hydrogenation cycles. This suggests that the PtSn0.3 catalyst might have better stability compared to other PtSn catalysts.

Liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural is a common practice in the industry, using catalysts like CuCr, Ni, Co, Ru, Pd, and their combinations to improve activity and selectivity. However, these catalysts often suffer from side reactions that decrease the selectivity to furfuryl alcohol. Adding tin to platinum-based catalysts has been shown to improve their efficiency in hydrogenating various unsaturated carbonyl compounds. The authors propose a systematic study of the effect of tin content on the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt/SiO2 catalysts modified with SnBu4 for the liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol. Chromatographic analysis was used to determine the content of tin in each bimetallic catalyst. The results showed that the PtSn catalysts had higher activity than the monometallic catalysts, especially when the tin-to-platinum atomic ratio was lower. Stability tests showed that the PtSn0.3 catalyst maintained a high level of conversion after three hydrogenation cycles, indicating its potential for practical application.

2. In the hydrogenation of furfural, a general problem is the formation of secondary products like acetals due to reactions between the substrate and the solvent. However, the Pt-based catalysts used in this study did not show signs of such reactions, indicating an advantage of these catalysts over others.

3. The stability tests revealed that the Pt/SiO2 catalyst suffered a certain deactivation in subsequent cycles of hydrogenation, reaching a conversion of 30% after the third cycle. In contrast, the PtSn0.3 catalyst maintained a high level of conversion even after three cycles, showing its potential for practical use in the hydrogenation of furfural.

1. 焦基醇，通过糠醛的氢化的主要产物，在化学工业中被广泛应用于不同特性的树脂生产。它还被用作制造赖氨酸、维生素C、润滑剂、分散剂和四氢糠基醇等中间体。液相氢化是工业实践中常见的做法，使用如铜铬、镍、钴、钌和钯等催化剂及其组合来提高活性和选择性。然而，这些催化剂常伴随着CO键氢解、脱羰化、氢化和呋喃环开裂等副反应，导致对焦基醇的选择性降低。将锡添加到铂基催化剂中已被证明可以提高它们在氢化多种不饱和羰基化合物方面的效率。本文作者提出系统研究锡含量对铂/SiO2催化剂改性后SnBu4用于液相糠醛氢化到焦基醇的效果。通过气相色谱法分析溶液中有机金属化合物随反应时间的变化，确定了每个双金属催化剂中的锡含量。结果表明，PtSn催化剂比单金属催化剂具有更高的活性，尤其是当锡/铂原子比较低时。稳定性测试显示，PtSn0.3催化剂在三个氢化周期后仍能保持高转化率，表明其在实际应用中的潜力。

2. 在糠醛氢化过程中，一个普遍的问题是由于溶剂与底物之间的反应形成二甲醚类副产品。然而，本文使用的铂基催化剂并未显示出此类反应的迹象，这表明这些催化剂相对于其他催化剂的优势。

3. 稳定性测试揭示了Pt/SiO2催化剂在后续氢化周期中遭受了一定程度的失活，第三轮后转化率为30%。相比之下，PtSn0.3催化剂即使在三个循环后仍能维持较高的转化率，显示了其在糠醛氢化中的潜在实用性。
