The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications due to its higher efficiency compared to thermal methods. This process is crucial for fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, both theoretical and experimental methodologies are employed. Theoretical approaches involve molecular kinetic models, while experimental methods include detailed analysis of reaction kinetics, catalyst characterization, and process optimization techniques.
