1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes significantly to industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process enhances activity and selectivity when using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems. Theoretical studies utilize computational methods to analyze and predict catalyst behavior, while experimental methodologies involve synthesis, characterization, and testing under specific conditions. Optimization of selectivity and efficiency occurs through systematic parameter adjustment.

2. The electronic and geometric structures of supported platinum, gold, and platinum-gold catalysts are crucial for understanding their catalytic properties. Theoretical approaches focus on elucidating how these structures influence reactivity, while experimental techniques aim to synthesize, characterize, and test catalysts under real-world conditions.
