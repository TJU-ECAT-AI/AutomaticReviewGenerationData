Electronic and geometric structures of supported platinum, gold, and platinum-gold catalysts play significant roles in various industrial applications, particularly in the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, which is essential for fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those composed of platinum and nickel, are favored due to their superior activity and selectivity over single-metal catalysts. Experimental methodologies for these catalysts typically involve preparation techniques such as impregnation or co-precipitation. Theoretical studies often utilize density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic and geometric properties of catalysts. Optimization of the catalytic process aims to maximize conversion rates while preserving product purity and selectivity through adjustments to parameters like catalyst composition, support type, and reaction conditions.

支持的铂、金和铂-金催化剂的电子和几何结构在各种工业应用中起着关键作用，特别是对于C═O键的催化氢化，这是精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化的基础。双金属催化剂，尤其是铂和镍的复合物，因其相对于单一金属催化剂的优越活性和选择性而受到青睐。这些催化剂的制备方法通常包括浸渍或共沉淀等技术。理论研究经常采用密度泛函理论（DFT）来探究催化剂的电子和几何特性。通过调整催化剂组成、支持类型和反应条件等参数，优化催化过程以实现高转化率的同时保持产品纯度和选择性是目标。
