<p>Despite the intensive research into the catalytic activity of gold in a restricted nanoscale size range [1], the catalytic origin of nanosized gold and gold-based bimetallic catalysts remains elusive. One of the main problems is the lack in understanding of the nanoscale coresurface property correlation.</p>
<p>The understanding of the compositionactivity relationship is essential for the exploitation of the synergistic properties of multimetallic nanoparticles in catalytic reactions. This paper focuses on the discussion of findings from the investigation of bimetallic gold-platinum (AuPt) nanoparticles of different compositions.</p>
<p>Infrared spectroscopic data for CO adsorption on silica-supported AuPt nanoparticles reveal that the surface binding sites are dependent on the bimetallic composition.</p>
<p>The analysis of this dependence further led to the conclusion that the relative Au- atop and Pt-atop sites for the linear CO adsorption on the nanoparticle surface are not only correlated with the bimetallic composition, but also with the electronic effect as a result of the d-band shift of Pt in the bimetallic nanocrystals, which is the first demonstration of the nanoscale coresurface property correlation for the bimetallic nanoparticles over a wide range of bimetallic composition.</p>
<p>A further examination of the electrocatalysis data for methanol oxidation reaction on carbon-supported AuPt nanoparticle catalysts reveal important insights into the participation of CO or OH adsorption on Au sites and the catalytic activity of Pt in the AuPt alloys with relatively high Au concentration.</p>
<p>Implications of these findings to synergistic correlation of the bifunctional activity of the bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts with the bimetallic composition are also discussed.</p>

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, particularly Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts are optimized through methodologies that encompass both theoretical modeling and experimental studies. The literature highlights the importance of understanding the synergistic properties of bimetallic nanoparticles, focusing on the investigation of AuPt nanoparticles of varying compositions. The surface binding sites of CO on these nanoparticles are found to be dependent on the bimetallic composition, revealing correlations with electronic effects, such as the d-band shift of Pt. The electrocatalytic activity of these nanoparticles in methanol oxidation reactions is also discussed, emphasizing the participation of CO or OH adsorption on Au sites and the catalytic activity of Pt, especially in alloys with a relatively high Au concentration. The findings suggest a synergistic correlation between the bifunctional activity of the bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts and their bimetallic composition, contributing to enhanced selectivity and efficiency in the catalytic process.
