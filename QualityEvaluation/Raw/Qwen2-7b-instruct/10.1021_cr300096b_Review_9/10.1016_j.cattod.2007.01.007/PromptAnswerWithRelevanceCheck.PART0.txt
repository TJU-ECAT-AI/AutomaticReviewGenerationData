[1] "The understanding of the electronic effect is based on the correlation between the spectral features and findings from a previous DFT calculation on the d-band of Pt atoms in bimetallic AuPt surfaces [17]."
[2] "The lattice parameters of the bimetallic nanoparticles, as shown by the half filled circle data points and lines, were found to scale linearly with Pt%."
[3] "It is very interesting that this band becomes insignificant or even absent at >  45% Pt."
[4] "The fact that the disappearance of the Au-atop CO band at >  45% Pt is accompanied by a gradual shift of the Pt-atop CO band is indicative of a unique synergistic surface property in which the Pt-atop CO adsorption is greatly favored over the Au-atop CO adsorption."
[5] "There seems to be a subtle difference in the redox current, which is perhaps suggestive of the surface composition difference."
[6] "The finding that the mass activity in the alkaline electrolyte exhibits a maximum around 6585% Au is in contrast to the small and gradual increase from no activity of Au to high activity of Pt in the acidic electrolyte."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes allow for the selective transformation of organic compounds into valuable products, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of chemical manufacturing. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include theoretical simulations using computational chemistry tools, such as density functional theory (DFT), to predict reaction pathways and catalyst behavior. Additionally, experimental techniques, like batch reactor studies, flow cell experiments, and in situ spectroscopic methods, are used to probe reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance under real-world conditions.
2. The maximum mass activity for the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds in the alkaline electrolyte is observed around 65-85% Au, which contrasts with the small and gradual increase from no activity of Au to high activity of Pt in the acidic electrolyte. This indicates that the presence of Au in the catalyst modifies the electrocatalytic properties of both Au and Pt, resulting in enhanced performance in the alkaline conditions. The Au atoms, possibly acting as a bifunctional catalyst, participate in the catalytic reaction of Pt in the alloy, contributing to the overall activity and selectivity of the process.

2. 在碱性电解质中，催化氢化C═O键的最大质量活性发生在约65-85%的Au中，这与酸性电解质中Au无活性到Pt高活性的小而渐进的增加形成对比。这表明Au在催化剂中的存在改变了Au和Pt的电催化性质，导致碱性条件下的增强性能。Au原子可能作为双功能催化剂参与Pt在合金中的催化反应，从而提高整个过程的活性和选择性。

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes are optimized and enhanced through methodologies that include theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and experimental studies. The bimetallic nature of these catalysts allows for synergistic interactions between the metals, improving the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process. For instance, the Au-atop and Pt-atop CO bands on the surface of AuPt nanoparticles correlate with the electronic effect due to the d-band shift of Pt, indicating a synergistic effect of Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms in the alloyed surface. The maximum mass activity for alkaline conditions around the composition of 65-85% Au matches the transition of the band features for CO adsorption, suggesting a cooperative interaction between CO and OH adsorption on Au sites and the catalytic activity of Pt in the alloy. Further research aims to quantitatively correlate these findings with DFT models and interfacial reactivity studies to provide mechanistic insights into the behavior of bimetallic nanoparticles and catalysts.
