[1] "The understanding of the electronic effect is based on the correlation between the spectral features and findings from a previous DFT calculation on the d-band of Pt atoms in bimetallic AuPt surfaces [17]."
[2] "The lattice parameters of the bimetallic nanoparticles, as shown by the half filled circle data points and lines, were found to scale linearly with Pt%."
[3] "It is very interesting that this band becomes insignificant or even absent at >  45% Pt."
[4] "The fact that the disappearance of the Au-atop CO band at >  45% Pt is accompanied by a gradual shift of the Pt-atop CO band is indicative of a unique synergistic surface property in which the Pt-atop CO adsorption is greatly favored over the Au-atop CO adsorption."
[5] "There seems to be a subtle difference in the redox current, which is perhaps suggestive of the surface composition difference."
[6] "The finding that the mass activity in the alkaline electrolyte exhibits a maximum around 6585% Au is in contrast to the small and gradual increase from no activity of Au to high activity of Pt in the acidic electrolyte."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes allow for the selective transformation of organic compounds into valuable products, enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of chemical manufacturing. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include theoretical simulations using computational chemistry tools, such as density functional theory (DFT), to predict reaction pathways and catalyst behavior. Additionally, experimental techniques, like batch reactor studies, flow cell experiments, and in situ spectroscopic methods, are used to probe reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance under real-world conditions.
2. The maximum mass activity for the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds in the alkaline electrolyte is observed around 65-85% Au, which contrasts with the small and gradual increase from no activity of Au to high activity of Pt in the acidic electrolyte. This indicates that the presence of Au in the catalyst modifies the electrocatalytic properties of both Au and Pt, resulting in enhanced performance in the alkaline conditions. The Au atoms, possibly acting as a bifunctional catalyst, participate in the catalytic reaction of Pt in the alloy, contributing to the overall activity and selectivity of the process.

1. 催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用铂-镍等双金属催化剂，对工业和研究应用如精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化具有重要意义。这些过程允许有机化合物的选择性转换为有价值的产物，提高了化学制造的效率和可持续性。用于研究、优化和增强选择性和效率的方法包括理论模拟，使用计算化学工具（如密度泛函理论）来预测反应途径和催化剂行为。此外，实验技术，如批式反应器研究、流动细胞实验和原位光谱方法，用于探查在实际条件下反应机制和催化剂性能。
2. 在碱性电解质中，催化氢化C═O键的最大质量活性发生在约65-85%的Au中，这与酸性电解质中Au无活性到Pt高活性的小而渐进的增加形成对比。这表明Au在催化剂中的存在改变了Au和Pt的电催化性质，导致碱性条件下的增强性能。Au原子可能作为双功能催化剂参与Pt在合金中的催化反应，从而提高整个过程的活性和选择性。
