[1] "In the present study, we focused on the relative shift of the CO adsorption bands by keeping the same preparation and measurement conditions."
[2] "The understanding of the electronic effect is based on the correlation between the spectral features and findings from a previous DFT calculation on the d-band of Pt atoms in bimetallic AuPt surfaces [17]."
[3] "The finding that the mass activity in the alkaline electrolyte exhibits a maximum around 6585% Au is in contrast to the small and gradual increase from no activity of Au to high activity of Pt in the acidic electrolyte."
[4] "The correlation between the composition and the electrocatalytic activity for the above catalysts is assessed by analyzing the mass activity (i.e., the peak current density per unit total mass of metals) and the kinetic parameters (Tafel slope)."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These catalysts enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the process through optimized methodologies that involve both theoretical and experimental approaches. The relative shift of CO adsorption bands, the correlation between the electronic effect and the d-band of Pt atoms in bimetallic AuPt surfaces, the maximum mass activity in the alkaline electrolyte around 6585% Au, and the assessment of electrocatalytic activity through mass activity and kinetic parameters all play key roles in advancing this field. The use of Pt-Ni systems allows for efficient hydrogenation of C═O bonds, facilitating the production of valuable chemical intermediates and biofuels.
