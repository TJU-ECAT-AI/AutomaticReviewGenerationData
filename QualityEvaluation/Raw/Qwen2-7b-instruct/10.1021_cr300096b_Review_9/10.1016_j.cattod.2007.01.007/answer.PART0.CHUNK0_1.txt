[1] "The understanding of the compositionactivity relationship is essential for the exploitation of the synergistic properties of multimetallic nanoparticles in catalytic reactions."
[2] "This paper focuses on the discussion of findings from the investigation of bimetallic gold-platinum (AuPt) nanoparticles of different compositions."
[3] "Infrared spectroscopic data for CO adsorption on silica-supported AuPt nanoparticles reveal that the surface binding sites are dependent on the bimetallic composition."
[4] "The analysis of this dependence further led to the conclusion that the relative Au- atop and Pt-atop sites for the linear CO adsorption on the nanoparticle surface are not only correlated with the bimetallic composition, but also with the electronic effect as a result of the d-band shift of Pt in the bimetallic nanocrystals."
[5] "A further examination of the electrocatalysis data for methanol oxidation reaction on carbon-supported AuPt nanoparticle catalysts reveal important insights into the participation of CO or OH adsorption on Au sites and the catalytic activity of Pt in the AuPt alloys with relatively high Au concentration."
[6] "The understanding of the bimetallic nanocrystal phase and surface binding properties is essential to address some of the major problems in direct methanol oxidation fuel cells, such as poor activity of the anode catalysts, the methanol cross-over to the cathode electrode [8,9], and the poisoning of Pt catalysts by CO-like intermediate species [1012]."
[7] "The electrocatalytic MOR activity was also found to be dependent on both composition and treatment temperature."
[8] "The mass activity for the alkaline condition appears to exhibit a maximum around the composition of 6585% Au, which is remarkably close to the composition range (65%Au) observed for the transition of the band features (see Fig. 3)."
[9] "The finding that the mass activity in the alkaline electrolyte exhibits a maximum around 6585% Au is in contrast to the small and gradual increase from no activity of Au to high activity of Pt in the acidic electrolyte."
[10] "Our previous in situ measurements of the interfacial mass change accompanying the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol also indicated the formation of Au oxides (Au2O3, AuOH or Au(OH)3) on gold nanoparticle surfaces [40]."
[11] "The bifunctional activity in the alkaline electrolyte involves the participation of CO and OH adsorption on Au sites in the catalytic reaction of Pt in the alloy via a combination of reaction steps (see Scheme 1),including the adsorption of MeOH on Pt followed by dehydrogenation, the formation of intermediate COad/Pt, the transfer of COad/Pt to neighboring Au-atop sites forming COad/ Au, and the reactions of Pt-COad + Au-OHad and Au- COad + Au-OHad towards the final product (CO3 2)."
