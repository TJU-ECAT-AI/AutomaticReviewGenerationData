[1] "The AuPt nanoparticles have been shown to exhibit bimetallic surface properties."
[2] "This finding further led to the correlation of the Au-atop and Pt-atop CO bands on the surface of the alloy nanoparticles of a wide range of bimetallic composition with the electronic effect as a result of the d-band shift of Pt in the bimetallic nanocrystals."
[3] "The finding of the maximum mass activity for alkaline conditions around the composition of 6585% Au coincides remarkably with the finding of the composition of 65% Au for the transition of the band features for CO adsorption, suggesting a synergistic effect of the surface reactivity for Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms in the alloyed nanocrystal surface."
[4] "Further quantitative correlation of the findings with theoretical modeling based on density functional theory [17,33,34,41] along with studies of the catalytic or interfacial reactivities, will provide mechanistic details into fundamental questions related to the bimetallic nanoparticles and catalysts."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes are optimized and enhanced through methodologies that include theoretical modeling based on density functional theory (DFT) and experimental studies. The bimetallic nature of these catalysts allows for synergistic interactions between the metals, improving the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process. For instance, the Au-atop and Pt-atop CO bands on the surface of AuPt nanoparticles correlate with the electronic effect due to the d-band shift of Pt, indicating a synergistic effect of Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms in the alloyed surface. The maximum mass activity for alkaline conditions around the composition of 65-85% Au matches the transition of the band features for CO adsorption, suggesting a cooperative interaction between CO and OH adsorption on Au sites and the catalytic activity of Pt in the alloy. Further research aims to quantitatively correlate these findings with DFT models and interfacial reactivity studies to provide mechanistic insights into the behavior of bimetallic nanoparticles and catalysts.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用如Pt-Ni这样的双金属催化剂，为精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究应用做出了贡献。这些过程通过理论建模（基于密度泛函理论DFT）和实验研究进行了优化和增强。双金属性质的这些催化剂允许金属之间的协同作用，提高了氢化过程的选择性和效率。例如，Au-atop和Pt-atopCO带在AuPt纳米颗粒表面的相关性与Pt原子d带偏移的电子效应有关，表明Au原子包围下的Pt原子在合金表面的协同作用效果。Au含量为65%-85%时的碱性条件下最大质量活性与CO吸附带特征的过渡相匹配，这表明CO和Au位点上的OH吸附与Pt在合金中的催化活性之间的合作互动。进一步的研究旨在定量地将这些发现与DFT模型和界面反应研究相关联，以提供关于双金属纳米粒子和催化剂行为的基本机制的见解。
