[1] "The book is intended primarily to provide experimental guidelines for organic synthesis."
[2] "There are no typical experimental procedures, no safety and handling information, and there is little practical detail on how to conduct a heterogeneous hydrogenation."
[3] "Perhaps the author will now produce a second volume on homogeneous hydrogenation."
[4] "Despite these criticisms, chemists will find this a useful guide, and it should be in all organic chemistry libraries."
[5] "Anyone doing a catalytic hydrogenation should consult the relevant chapter for reference."
[6] "The detail is excellent and should allow the chemist to choose how to carry out the process."
[7] "Of course, a major disadvantage of any work on heterogeneous hydrogenation is that synthetic chemists in the lab just want a good synthetic method."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis by S. Nishimura provides experimental guidelines for organic synthesis, focusing on hydrogenation reactions. While lacking detailed experimental procedures and safety information, it offers comprehensive coverage of different reduction processes. The book is considered useful for chemists due to its detailed content, enabling them to choose suitable methods for carrying out hydrogenation processes. It is aimed at organic chemists rather than catalysis experts, and it may inspire a second volume on homogeneous hydrogenation. Despite some limitations, the book should be valuable in organic chemistry libraries.
