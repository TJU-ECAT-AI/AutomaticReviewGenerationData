[1] "The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis is intended primarily to provide experimental guidelines for organic synthesis."
[2] "There are no typical experimental procedures, no safety and handling information, and there is little practical detail on how to conduct a heterogeneous hydrogenation."
[3] "Reactors are covered in one and a half pages mostly a list of references to other sources."
[4] "Scale-up issues are hardly mentioned, even in the section on nitro reductions."
[5] "Despite these criticisms, chemists will find this a useful guide, and it should be in all organic chemistry libraries."
[6] "The volume will inevitably be compared to Augustine's Heterogeneous Catalysis for the Synthetic Chemist (Marcel Dekker, 1995), which has much more fundamental information about catalysis, catalytic mechanisms, and kinetics."
[7] "The books are complementary - you should buy both!"

The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis aims to serve as a guide for organic synthesis, offering detailed information on reducing alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles, imines, nitros, acids and esters, aromatics, heterocycles, reductive alkylation, and hydrogenolysis. Despite lacking typical experimental procedures, safety information, and practical details on conducting heterogeneous hydrogenations, the book remains a valuable resource due to its comprehensive coverage and the quality of detail provided, enabling chemists to choose appropriate processes for their needs. It is intended to complement Augustine's Heterogeneous Catalysis for the Synthetic Chemist, which focuses more on fundamental aspects of catalysis, mechanisms, and kinetics.

《异相催化氢化有机合成手册》旨在为有机合成提供指导，涵盖了降低烯烃、炔烃、羰基、腈、腙、硝基、酸和酯、芳香族化合物、杂环化合物、还原烷基化和氢解等方面的内容。尽管缺少典型的实验程序、安全信息和实施异相氢化反应的具体细节，但由于其全面的覆盖范围和提供的详细信息质量高，使得该书成为有价值的参考资料，帮助化学家选择合适的流程。它旨在与《合成化学中的异相催化》互补，后者更侧重于催化作用的基础知识、机制和动力学。
