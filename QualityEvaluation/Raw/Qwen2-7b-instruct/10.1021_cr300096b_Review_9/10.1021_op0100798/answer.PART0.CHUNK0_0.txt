[1] "The book is intended primarily to provide experimental guidelines for organic synthesis."
[2] "There are no typical experimental procedures, no safety and handling information, and there is little practical detail on how to conduct a heterogeneous hydrogenation."
[3] "Reactors are covered in one and a half pages mostly a list of references to other sources and scale-up issues are hardly mentioned."
[4] "This is a very useful book, since it covers the topic from an organic chemist's viewpoint (rather than a catalysis expert's view)."
[5] "Anyone doing a catalytic hydrogenation should consult the relevant chapter for reference the detail is excellent and should allow the chemist to choose how to carry out the process."
[6] "Despite these criticisms, chemists will find this a useful guide, and it should be in all organic chemistry libraries."
[7] "Perhaps the author will now produce a second volume on homogeneous hydrogenation."
[8] "The books are complementary you should buy both!"

The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis provides experimental guidelines tailored for organic chemists, covering various types of reductions such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles, imines, nitros, acids, esters, aromatics, heterocycles, reductive alkylation, and hydrogenolysis. It offers detailed information suitable for choosing how to conduct a catalytic hydrogenation process, although it lacks typical experimental procedures, safety information, and practical details on reactor operations and scale-up issues. This book serves as a valuable resource for chemists due to its comprehensive coverage, and it is expected that a similar volume on homogeneous hydrogenation could complement its contents.

《异相催化氢化在有机合成中的手册》提供了针对有机化学家的实验指南，涵盖了各种类型的还原，包括烯烃、炔烃、羰基、腈、胺、硝基、酸、酯、芳烃、杂环化合物、重排烷基化和氢解。它提供了选择执行催化氢化过程的详细信息，尽管缺少典型实验程序、安全信息以及反应器操作和放大问题的实际细节。这本书对化学家来说是一个有价值的资源，因为它涵盖了广泛的内容，并且预计与之互补的一卷关于均相氢化的书籍将会出现。
