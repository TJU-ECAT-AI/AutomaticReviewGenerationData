[1] "The book is intended primarily to provide experimental guidelines for organic synthesis."
[2] "There are no typical experimental procedures, no safety and handling information, and there is little practical detail on how to conduct a heterogeneous hydrogenation."
[3] "Reactors are covered in one and a half pages mostly a list of references to other sources and scale-up issues are hardly mentioned, even in the section on nitro reductions."
[4] "Nevertheless, this is a very useful book, since it covers the topic from an organic chemist's viewpoint (rather than a catalysis expert's view)."
[5] "With over 700 pages the coverage is fairly comprehensive, and anyone doing a catalytic hydrogenation should consult the relevant chapter for reference."
[6] "The books are complementary - you should buy both!"
[7] "Despite these criticisms, chemists will find this a useful guide, and it should be in all organic chemistry libraries."

The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis provides experimental guidelines for organic synthesis, focusing on topics like reduction of alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles, imines, nitros, acids and esters, aromatics, heterocycles, reductive alkylation, and hydrogenolysis. It is considered useful for chemists due to its comprehensive coverage and detailed information, despite lacking typical experimental procedures, safety details, and practical conduct guidance for heterogeneous hydrogenations. The book is seen as complementary to other resources on the subject, making it a valuable guide for chemists in the field.

《异相催化氢化在有机合成中的手册》提供了有机合成的实验指导，涵盖了烯烃、炔烃、羰基、腈、酰胺、硝基、酸酯、芳香族化合物、杂环化合物、还原烷基化和氢解等领域的还原反应。这本书被视作实用指南，因为它提供了全面的内容和详细的信息，尽管它缺乏典型实验程序、安全细节和异相氢化过程的实际操作指导。这本书被认为是该领域资源的补充，对于化学家来说是一个有价值的参考。
