[1] "The book is intended primarily to provide experimental guidelines for organic synthesis."
[2] "There are no typical experimental procedures, no safety and handling information, and there is little practical detail on how to conduct a heterogeneous hydrogenation."
[3] "Reactors are covered in one and a half pages mostly a list of references to other sources and scale-up issues are hardly mentioned."
[4] "Despite these criticisms, chemists will find this a useful guide, and it should be in all organic chemistry libraries."

The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis aims to offer guidance on experimental procedures for organic synthesis. However, it lacks detailed experimental protocols, safety measures, and practical information on conducting heterogeneous hydrogenation. Despite these shortcomings, the book remains a valuable resource for chemists due to its comprehensive coverage and detailed insights into specific reduction processes. It is recommended for inclusion in organic chemistry libraries.
