[1] "The book is intended primarily to provide experimental guidelines for organic synthesis."
[2] "There are no typical experimental procedures, no safety and handling information, and there is little practical detail on how to conduct a heterogeneous hydrogenation."
[3] "Reactors are covered in one and a half pages mostly a list of references to other sources and scale-up issues are hardly mentioned."
[4] "This is a very useful book, since it covers the topic from an organic chemist's viewpoint (rather than a catalysis expert's view)."
[5] "Anyone doing a catalytic hydrogenation should consult the relevant chapter for reference the detail is excellent and should allow the chemist to choose how to carry out the process."
[6] "Despite these criticisms, chemists will find this a useful guide, and it should be in all organic chemistry libraries."
[7] "Perhaps the author will now produce a second volume on homogeneous hydrogenation."
[8] "The books are complementary you should buy both!"

The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis provides experimental guidelines tailored for organic chemists, covering various types of reductions such as alkenes, alkynes, carbonyls, nitriles, imines, nitros, acids, esters, aromatics, heterocycles, reductive alkylation, and hydrogenolysis. It offers detailed information suitable for choosing how to conduct a catalytic hydrogenation process, although it lacks typical experimental procedures, safety information, and practical details on reactor operations and scale-up issues. This book serves as a valuable resource for chemists due to its comprehensive coverage, and it is expected that a similar volume on homogeneous hydrogenation could complement its contents.

The Handbook of Heterogeneous Catalytic Hydrogenation for Organic Synthesis by S. Nishimura provides experimental guidelines for organic synthesis, focusing on hydrogenation reactions. While lacking detailed experimental procedures and safety information, it offers comprehensive coverage of different reduction processes. The book is considered useful for chemists due to its detailed content, enabling them to choose suitable methods for carrying out hydrogenation processes. It is aimed at organic chemists rather than catalysis experts, and it may inspire a second volume on homogeneous hydrogenation. Despite some limitations, the book should be valuable in organic chemistry libraries.
