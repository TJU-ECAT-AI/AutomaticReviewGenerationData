The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes enable the selective transformation of organic compounds into desired products, optimizing chemical pathways for enhanced efficiency and selectivity. 

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a range of methodologies. Theoretical approaches involve computational chemistry simulations to predict reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior. Experimentally, they synthesize catalysts using methods like sol-gel, anodic oxidation, ALD, CVD, and spin-coating to achieve desired properties. The selection of catalyst components and preparation conditions plays a crucial role in achieving high reactivity and selectivity.

The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol (UA) in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes is significantly improved by Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts compared to crude catalysts prepared via impregnation-reduction methods. This is attributed to the unique characteristics of the catalysts, such as the Pt-Ni particle size, distribution, and electronic state.

Mesoporous titania films with precise pore structures are successfully prepared on Ti substrates through the sol-gel method using Pluronic F127 as a template. The morphology and porous structure of these films can be tailored by adjusting parameters such as the F127/Ti ratio, pH, and aging time. Powder titania supports are also produced similarly, utilized for catalyst optimization.

The performance of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts can be varied by modifying conditions of the PtSn carbonyl complex adsorption and thermal treatment. This enables control over the metal content, mean particle size, and particle size distribution, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity.

In the hydrogenation of citral, PtSn/TiO2 catalysts demonstrate a reaction rate ranging from 0.2 to 3.3 min−1, with a high selectivity to UA reaching up to 90% at a citral conversion exceeding 95%. This highlights the effectiveness of these catalysts in fine chemical synthesis, showcasing the potential for practical applications in industry and research.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用铂-镍等双金属催化剂，对各种工业和研究应用（如精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化）做出了重大贡献。这些过程允许有机化合物的定向转化，优化化学路径以提高效率和选择性。

为了研究、优化并增强此过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用了一系列方法。理论方面涉及计算化学模拟来预测反应机制和催化剂行为。实验上，他们通过溶胶-凝胶法、阳极氧化、ALD、CVD和旋涂等方法合成催化剂，以实现所需特性。催化剂成分和制备条件的选择对于达到高反应性和选择性至关重要。

与通过浸渍还原方法制备的粗催化剂相比，铂-镍双金属催化剂在不饱和醛氢化为相应的不饱和醇时表现出显著更高的选择性。这归因于催化剂的独特特性，如铂-镍颗粒大小、分布和电子状态。

通过溶胶-凝胶方法使用聚氧乙烯作为模板成功制备了具有精确孔结构的Ti基体上的介孔二氧化钛薄膜。通过调整参数如聚氧乙烯/钛比、pH值和老化时间，可以调控这些薄膜的形态和孔隙结构。同样地，也制备了粉末型二氧化钛支持物，用于催化剂优化。

通过修改铂锡羰基复合物吸附和催化剂热处理条件，可以改变PtSn/TiO2催化剂的性能。这种方法能够控制金属含量、平均颗粒大小和颗粒大小分布，从而增强催化活性和选择性。
