The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes enable the selective transformation of organic compounds into desired products, optimizing chemical pathways for enhanced efficiency and selectivity. 

To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a range of methodologies. Theoretical approaches involve computational chemistry simulations to predict reaction mechanisms and catalyst behavior. Experimentally, they synthesize catalysts using methods like sol-gel, anodic oxidation, ALD, CVD, and spin-coating to achieve desired properties. The selection of catalyst components and preparation conditions plays a crucial role in achieving high reactivity and selectivity.

The selectivity to the unsaturated alcohol (UA) in the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes is significantly improved by Pt-Ni bimetallic catalysts compared to crude catalysts prepared via impregnation-reduction methods. This is attributed to the unique characteristics of the catalysts, such as the Pt-Ni particle size, distribution, and electronic state.

Mesoporous titania films with precise pore structures are successfully prepared on Ti substrates through the sol-gel method using Pluronic F127 as a template. The morphology and porous structure of these films can be tailored by adjusting parameters such as the F127/Ti ratio, pH, and aging time. Powder titania supports are also produced similarly, utilized for catalyst optimization.

The performance of PtSn/TiO2 catalysts can be varied by modifying conditions of the PtSn carbonyl complex adsorption and thermal treatment. This enables control over the metal content, mean particle size, and particle size distribution, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity.

In the hydrogenation of citral, PtSn/TiO2 catalysts demonstrate a reaction rate ranging from 0.2 to 3.3 min−1, with a high selectivity to UA reaching up to 90% at a citral conversion exceeding 95%. This highlights the effectiveness of these catalysts in fine chemical synthesis, showcasing the potential for practical applications in industry and research.
