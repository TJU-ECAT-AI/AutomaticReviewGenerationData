1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling more efficient and selective reactions in microreactors. Structured reactors improve heat and mass transfer, allow isothermal operation, and provide a narrow residence time distribution. Inorganic mesoporous thin films are attractive catalyst supports due to their large surface areas and narrow pore size distribution, which prevent metal sintering and facilitate good dispersion of the active component.

2. The efficiency of catalytic microreactors relies on deposition techniques that create thin, uniform, and stable catalytic coatings with high surface area and dispersion of the active component. Mesoporous titania supports are used to develop novel PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts with controlled stoichiometry, demonstrating superior performance in selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to corresponding unsaturated alcohols compared to crude catalysts.

3. The selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process are optimized through systematic variations in synthesis parameters such as solvent type, precursor concentration, metal precursor to support ratio, duration of adsorption, and thermal treatment methods. The use of PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursors provides more uniform metal particle size distribution, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity towards unsaturated alcohols.

1. 催化氢化C═O键在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究领域中起着重要作用，因为它能促进微反应器中更高效、选择性的反应。结构化反应器通过提高热和质量传递、实现恒温操作并提供窄的停留时间分布来优化催化性能。具有大比表面积和窄孔径分布的无机介孔薄膜是吸引人的催化剂支撑材料，因为它们可以防止金属聚集并促进活性组分的良好分散。

2. 催化微反应器的效率依赖于沉积技术，这些技术能够形成均匀、稳定且具有高比表面积的催化涂层。介孔二氧化钛支持被用于开发具有可控金属比例的新型铂锡双金属纳米结构催化剂，这些催化剂在选择性氢化不饱和醛类为相应的不饱和醇方面表现出优越性能，与通过浸渍还原方法制备的粗催化剂相比。

3. 通过改变吸附时间和热处理条件等合成参数优化氢化过程的选择性和效率。使用铂锡混合金属簇前体可以提供更均匀的金属颗粒大小分布，从而提高催化剂活性和选择性，使其偏向生成不饱和醇。
