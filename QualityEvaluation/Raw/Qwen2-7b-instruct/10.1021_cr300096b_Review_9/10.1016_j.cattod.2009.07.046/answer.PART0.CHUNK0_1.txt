Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications, such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is crucial for generating valuable chemical intermediates and end products efficiently. In the context of this study, researchers aimed to develop novel PtSn bimetallic nanostructured catalysts supported on mesoporous titania. These catalysts were optimized for enhanced selectivity and efficiency in hydrogenation reactions, particularly for converting unsaturated aldehydes into corresponding unsaturated alcohols (UA). The methodology involved preparing titania films with tailored pore structures and developing bimetallic catalysts by adsorbing PtSn mixed-metal cluster precursors onto these supports. The optimization of catalyst preparation conditions, such as the duration of adsorption and thermal treatment, allowed for the adjustment of mean particle size and mode of particle size distribution. The hydrogenation of citral was tested as a model reaction, demonstrating high selectivity to UA (up to 90%) with significant improvements in reaction rate (TOF between 0.2 and 3.3 min−1) compared to traditional catalysts.
