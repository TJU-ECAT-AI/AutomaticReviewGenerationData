[1] "Bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts have become increasingly important in industrial processes [13]."
[2] "Therefore, improved, industrially viable preparation techniques are necessary to more precisely formulate multicomponent catalysts."
[3] "Combined with previously published reports, the results presented here suggest that (1) the AgPt/ SiO2 catalysts that are most active for hydrogenation of the EpB olefin function consist of an adlayer of Ag on Pt rather than a surface or bulk alloy and that (2) the higher activity and selectivity of ED-prepared AgPt/SiO2 catalysts for C@C hydrogenation of EpB to 1-epoxybutane are consistent with computed electronic (ligand) and bifunctional effects."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like AgPt systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications such as the synthesis of fine chemicals and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches. Theoretical studies, often utilizing computational chemistry tools like density functional theory (DFT), help in understanding the electronic structure, chemical properties, and potential mechanisms underlying the catalytic activity. Experimental methods, including techniques like X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), allow for the characterization of catalysts and the evaluation of their performance under specific conditions. Together, these methodologies enable researchers to develop more effective catalysts with tailored properties for specific applications, such as enhancing the hydrogenation of olefin functions in epoxides or improving the conversion of biomass-derived materials.

The electronic structure and chemical properties of catalysts prepared by the electroless deposition (ED) of Ag onto Pt/SiO2 were studied using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and den- sity functional theory (DFT) calculations. XPS studies revealed a negative shift (up to 0.75 eV) in the Ag 3d binding energy (BE) relative to bulk Ag. Both the magnitude and direction of the shift are consistent with DFT calculations of model Ag/Pt(111) surfaces. DFT calculations have also been employed to study the adsorption of two probe molecules, carbon monoxide and 1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB), on the model surfaces. Combined with previously published reports, the results presented here suggest that (1) the AgPt/ SiO2 catalysts that are most active for hydrogenation of the EpB olefin function consist of an adlayer of Ag on Pt rather than a surface or bulk alloy and that (2) the higher activity and selectivity of ED-prepared AgPt/SiO2 catalysts for C@C hydrogenation of EpB to 1-epoxybutane are consistent with computed elec- tronic (ligand) and bifunctional effects.

[1] "Theoretical and experimental studies of AgPt interactions for supported AgPt bimetallic catalysts"
[2] "Bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts have become increasingly important in industrial processes"

[4] "Impregnation techniques are generally utilized for the preparation of large-volume bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts"

[9] "Modifications in electronic properties may be predicted using theoretical calculations"
[10] "For example, Hrtel et al. established a model which predicts that deposition of Ag onto Pt will yield a negative shift in the Ag 3d binding energy (XPS) based on the density of states (DOS) of the substrate (Pt) and secondary metal (Ag)"
[11] "The shift in the Ag 3d BE indicates modification of the Ag d-band structure by Pt"

After explaining the experimental and theoretical methodology used in the study, we present experimental XPS results showing that Ag is electronically modified through an interaction with Pt, thus confirming the preferential deposition of Ag onto Pt sites rather than on the support"

Industrial processes increasingly rely on bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts, necessitating the integration of modeling, preparation, and characterization techniques to optimize catalyst compositions, formulations, and surface sensitivity. Electroless deposition (ED) is an effective alternative for precise metal placement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) offers insights into the surface chemistry and electronic effects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can predict modifications in electronic properties, leading to rational tailoring of catalytic performance. The deposition of Ag onto Pt yields a negative shift in the Ag 3d binding energy, indicating an alteration of the Ag d-band structure. This shift enhances the AgCO bond strength, suggesting a rational approach to improving catalyst selectivity and efficiency. ED-prepared AgPt catalysts show enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenation reactions, particularly for the unsaturated epoxide 1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB) to 1-epoxybutane. XPS results confirm that Ag is preferentially deposited onto Pt sites, and DFT calculations elucidate the electronic structure and active surface mechanisms.

Industrial processes increasingly rely on bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts, necessitating the integration of modeling, preparation, and characterization techniques to optimize catalyst composition, formulation, and surface sensitivity. Traditional impregnation methods, though widely used, do not offer precise control over metal distribution, leading to catalysts with mixed particle compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) provides a more controlled approach for metal placement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is vital for evaluating preparation techniques, offering insights into surface chemistry. Theoretical calculations enable prediction of electronic property modifications, which can be tailored rationally. This study focuses on supported AgPt catalysts prepared via ED, demonstrating enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenating unsaturated epoxides. XPS and DFT calculations are employed to elucidate the catalyst's structure and mechanisms governing selectivity.
