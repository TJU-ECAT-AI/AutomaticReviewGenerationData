[1] "Theoretical and experimental studies of AgPt interactions for supported AgPt bimetallic catalysts"
[2] "Bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts have become increasingly important in industrial processes"
[3] "Efficient development of these complex, multimetallic catalysts requires collaboration between modeling, preparation, and characterization techniques to provide a priori determination of optimal compositions, accurate and reproducible formulations, and surface sensitive evaluation."
[4] "Impregnation techniques are generally utilized for the preparation of large-volume bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts"
[5] "However, these traditional techniques provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions"
[6] "One alternative preparation method that provides more control over metal placement is electroless deposition (ED)"
[7] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), is particularly useful for the evaluation of different preparation techniques since it provides information regarding the elements present at the surface (or near the surface) as well as their chemical environment"
[8] "The capability to tune the adsorption/desorption properties of a material through electronic interactions with a secondary metal suggests the ability to rationally tailor catalytic properties"
[9] "Modifications in electronic properties may be predicted using theoretical calculations"
[10] "For example, Hrtel et al. established a model which predicts that deposition of Ag onto Pt will yield a negative shift in the Ag 3d binding energy (XPS) based on the density of states (DOS) of the substrate (Pt) and secondary metal (Ag)"
[11] "The shift in the Ag 3d BE indicates modification of the Ag d-band structure by Pt"
[12] "Regardless, this modification in Ag d-electrons results in an increase in the AgCO bond strength (70 K increase in the desorption temperature) for AgPt compared to that of pure Ag"
[13] "While the AgPt bimetallic system has been methodically studied using model systems, little XPS data has been reported for supported AgPt catalysts"
[14] "XPS characterization is incorporated in concert with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to provide insights into the physical and electronic structure of the metal surface, and to facilitate identification of possible mechanisms that control the observed selectivity patterns"
[15] "This paper is organized as follows. After explaining the experimental and theoretical methodology used in the study, we present experimental XPS results showing that Ag is electronically modified through an interaction with Pt, thus confirming the preferential deposition of Ag onto Pt sites rather than on the support"
[16] "These results are compared to theoretical studies of various surface models to provide insights into the observed electronic effects"
[17] "This presentation is followed by a discussion of further theoretical calculations of the adsorption of CO and EpB on model bimetallic surfaces, which further elucidate the nature of the active catalytic surface"

Industrial processes increasingly rely on bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts, necessitating the integration of modeling, preparation, and characterization techniques to optimize catalyst compositions, formulations, and surface sensitivity. Electroless deposition (ED) is an effective alternative for precise metal placement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) offers insights into the surface chemistry and electronic effects. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can predict modifications in electronic properties, leading to rational tailoring of catalytic performance. The deposition of Ag onto Pt yields a negative shift in the Ag 3d binding energy, indicating an alteration of the Ag d-band structure. This shift enhances the AgCO bond strength, suggesting a rational approach to improving catalyst selectivity and efficiency. ED-prepared AgPt catalysts show enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenation reactions, particularly for the unsaturated epoxide 1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB) to 1-epoxybutane. XPS results confirm that Ag is preferentially deposited onto Pt sites, and DFT calculations elucidate the electronic structure and active surface mechanisms.

工业过程越来越多地依赖于双金属和多金属催化剂，需要将建模、制备和表征技术结合使用以优化催化剂组成、配方和表面敏感性。电沉积（ED）是一种有效的替代方法，用于精确控制金属分布。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）提供了关于表面化学和电子效应的见解。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算可以预测电子性质的变化，从而实现对催化性能的理性设计。将Ag沉积到Pt上导致Ag 3d结合能下降，表明Ag d带结构发生了改变。这种变化增强了AgCO键强度，暗示了一种改进催化剂选择性和效率的合理途径。ED制备的AgPt催化剂在氢化反应中表现出增强的活性和选择性，特别是对于不饱和环氧乙烷1-环氧-3-丁烯（EpB）转化为1-环氧丁烷。XPS结果证实Ag主要沉积在Pt位点上，而DFT计算揭示了表面的电子结构和活性机制。
