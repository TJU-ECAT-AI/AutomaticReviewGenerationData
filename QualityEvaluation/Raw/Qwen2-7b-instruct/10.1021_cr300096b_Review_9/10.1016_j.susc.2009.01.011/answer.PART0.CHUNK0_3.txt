[1] "Bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts have become increasingly important in industrial processes [13]."
[2] "Efficient development of these complex, multimetallic catalysts requires collaboration between modeling, preparation, and characterization techniques to provide a priori determination of optimal compositions, accurate and reproducible formulations, and surface sensitive evaluation."
[3] "Impregnation techniques are generally utilized for the preparation of large-volume bimetallic or multimetallic catalysts [4]."
[4] "However, these traditional techniques provide inadequate control over metal placement and accordingly yield catalysts containing both isolated, monometallic particles and bimetallic particles with varying compositions [57]."
[5] "One alternative preparation method that provides more control over metal placement is electroless deposition (ED)."
[6] "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), is particularly useful for the evaluation of different preparation techniques since it provides information regarding the elements present at the surface (or near the surface) as well as their chemical environment."
[7] "The capability to tune the adsorption/desorption properties of a material through electronic interactions with a secondary metal suggests the ability to rationally tailor catalytic properties."
[8] "Modifications in electronic properties may be predicted using theoretical calculations."
[9] "The AgPt bimetallic system has been methodically studied using model systems, little XPS data has been reported for supported AgPt catalysts."
[10] "In this study, we examine AgPt/SiO2 catalysts prepared by ED that show greatly enhanced activity and selectivity for C@C hydrogenation of the unsaturated epoxide 1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB) [10]."
[11] "XPS characterization is incorporated in concert with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to provide insights into the physical and electronic structure of the metal surface, and to facilitate identification of possible mechanisms that control the observed selectivity patterns."

Industrial processes increasingly rely on bimetallic and multimetallic catalysts, necessitating the integration of modeling, preparation, and characterization techniques to optimize catalyst composition, formulation, and surface sensitivity. Traditional impregnation methods, though widely used, do not offer precise control over metal distribution, leading to catalysts with mixed particle compositions. Electroless deposition (ED) provides a more controlled approach for metal placement. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is vital for evaluating preparation techniques, offering insights into surface chemistry. Theoretical calculations enable prediction of electronic property modifications, which can be tailored rationally. This study focuses on supported AgPt catalysts prepared via ED, demonstrating enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenating unsaturated epoxides. XPS and DFT calculations are employed to elucidate the catalyst's structure and mechanisms governing selectivity.

工业过程越来越依赖双金属和多金属催化剂，需要将建模、制备和表征技术结合使用，以优化催化剂的组成、配方和表面敏感性。传统的浸渍方法虽然被广泛使用，但无法提供精确的金属分布控制，导致催化剂中存在混合的单金属粒子。电沉积（ED）提供了更精确的金属定位方法。X射线光电子能谱（XPS）对于评估制备技术至关重要，能够提供表面（或接近表面）元素的存在及其化学环境的信息。理论计算可以预测电子属性的变化，并且可以通过与辅助金属的电子相互作用来调整，从而实现催化剂性能的理性设计。这项研究专注于通过ED制备的AgPt催化剂，这些催化剂显示出对不饱和环氧乙烷（EpB）氢化反应的增强活性和选择性。XPS和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算被用来阐明催化剂的结构，并揭示控制观察到的选择性模式的可能机制。
