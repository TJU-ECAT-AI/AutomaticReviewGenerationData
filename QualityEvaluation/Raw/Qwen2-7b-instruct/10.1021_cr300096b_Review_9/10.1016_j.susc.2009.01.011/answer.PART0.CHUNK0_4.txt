[1] "Bimetallic AgPt/SiO2 catalysts prepared by electroless deposition were studied by XPS, and various surface models for the catalysts were examined using DFT."
[2] "A significant shift (up to 0.75 eV) was observed in the Ag 3d BE relative to bulk Ag."
[3] "The magnitude and direction of the shift are consistent with a surface model in which Ag exists in an adlayer on the Pt surface, but are not incon- sistent with PtAg alloy models."
[4] "DFT studies of CO and EpB adsorption were used to refine the understanding of the surface model."
[5] "Since previous studies of the ED-prepared AgPt catalysts are consistent with weakened binding of CO and EpB, it is concluded that the active state of the surface is most likely well-represented by a Ag adlayer on a Pt surface."

1. Bimetallic AgPt/SiO2 catalysts prepared by electroless deposition were studied using XPS and DFT calculations. 
2. A notable shift in the Ag 3d binding energy (BE) up to 0.75 eV was observed compared to bulk Ag.  
3. The shift aligns with a surface model where Ag forms an adlayer on the Pt surface, though it's not inconsistent with PtAg alloy models.
4. DFT calculations of CO and EpB adsorption provided insights into the catalyst's surface structure.  
5. It was concluded that the active surface of the catalyst is likely represented by a Ag adlayer on a Pt surface, based on previous studies showing weakened binding of CO and EpB.

1. 通过电沉积制备的AgPt/SiO2双金属催化剂使用XPS和DFT计算进行了研究。
2. 相对于纯Ag，Ag的3d能级出现了高达0.75 eV的变化。
3. 这一变化与Ag在Pt表面形成吸附层的表面模型相吻合，并且不排斥PtAg合金模型。
4. DFT对CO和EpB吸附的研究深化了对催化剂表面结构的理解。  
5. 根据之前的研究结果，表现出CO和EpB结合力减弱，最终结论是活性表面可能由Ag吸附层覆盖在Pt表面表示。
