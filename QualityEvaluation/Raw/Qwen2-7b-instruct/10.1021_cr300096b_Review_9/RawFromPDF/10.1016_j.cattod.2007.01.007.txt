Abstract
The understanding of the composition–activity relationship is essential for the exploitation of the synergistic properties of multimetallic
nanoparticles in catalytic reactions. This paper focuses on the discussion of ﬁndings from the investigation of bimetallic gold-platinum (AuPt)
nanoparticles of different compositions. Infrared spectroscopic data for CO adsorption on silica-supported AuPt nanoparticles reveal that the
surface binding sites are dependent on the bimetallic composition. The analysis of this dependence further led to the conclusion that the relative Au-
atop and Pt-atop sites for the linear CO adsorption on the nanoparticle surface are not only correlated with the bimetallic composition, but also with
the electronic effect as a result of the d-band shift of Pt in the bimetallic nanocrystals, which is the ﬁrst demonstration of the nanoscale core–surface
property correlation for the bimetallic nanoparticles over a wide range of bimetallic composition. A further examination of the electrocatalysis data
for methanol oxidation reaction on carbon-supported AuPt nanoparticle catalysts reveal important insights into the participation of CO or OH
adsorption on Au sites and the catalytic activity of Pt in the AuPt alloys with relatively high Au concentration. Implications of these ﬁndings to
synergistic correlation of the bifunctional activity of the bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts with the bimetallic composition are also discussed.

1. Introduction
Despite the intensive research into the catalytic activity of
gold in a restricted nanoscale size range [1], the catalytic origin
of nanosized gold and gold-based bimetallic catalysts remains
elusive. One of the main problems is the lack in understanding
of the nanoscale core–surface property correlation. Gold-
platinum nanoparticles of 2–5 nm diameter presents an
intriguing system for delineating the correlation in view of
recent ability in synthesizing AuPt nanoparticles in a wide
range of bimetallic composition [2]. Is the AuPt nanocrystal
core alloyed or phase-segregated? How are the surface binding
properties correlated with the nanoscale bimetallic properties?
The answers to these questions have important implications not
only to the exploitation of catalytic activity of the nanoscale
bimetallic catalysts, but also to the general exploration of the
surface or interfacial reactivities of bimetallic or multimetallic
nanoparticles. XRD studies [2] revealed alloy properties for the
nanocrystal core which is in contrast to the miscibility gap
known for the bulk counterparts [3]. An infrared spectroscopic
study of the adsorption of CO on the nanoparticles can
effectively address the surface binding properties because its
stretching frequency is highly sensitive to the surface binding
sites [4], as widely reported for oxide-supported gold, platinum,
gold-platinum and other bimetallic catalysts prepared by vapor
deposition [5], cation-exchange, insipient wetness impregna-
tion [6] and dendrimer or cluster based methods [6,7].
The understanding of the bimetallic nanocrystal phase and
surface binding properties is essential to address some of the
major problems in direct methanol oxidation fuel cells, such as
poor activity of the anode catalysts, the ‘‘methanol cross-over’’
to the cathode electrode [8,9], and the poisoning of Pt catalysts
by CO-like intermediate species [10–12]. The exploration of
nanoscale gold-based bimetallic materials could potentially
provide a synergistic catalytic effect by minimizing or
eliminating the poisoning problem. For example, gold-
platinum (AuPt) nanoparticles could provide a synergistic
catalytic effect that involves the suppression of adsorbed
poisonous species and a change in electronic band structure to
modify the strength of the surface adsorption. With such a
bimetallic system, one could explore the viability of using Pt as
the main dehydrogenation sites, and Au together with Pt to

speed up the removal of poisonous species. The decrease in
activation energy to facilitate oxidative desorption or suppress
CO adsorption was previously considered to lead to sufﬁciently
high adsorptivity to support catalytic oxidation in alkaline
electrolytes [13–16]. A recent study [6] showed that catalysts
prepared by impregnation from Pt and Au precursors are similar
to those of monometallic Pt catalysts, suggesting that the
presence of Au did not affect the catalytic performance of Pt in
any signiﬁcant way. This was attributed to phase-segregation of
the two metals due to their miscibility gap. Recent density
functional theory (DFT) calculations [17] have indicated that
the d-band shift for Pt in a Pt-Au alloy on Au(1 1 1) differs from
that for a Pt-Au alloy on Pt(1 1 1). A stronger bonding of CO to
the ﬁrst layer of Pt on Au(1 1 1) exists compared with the
binding of CO on clean Pt. The Au substrate surprisingly
increases the Pt overlayer reactivity. The modeling suggests
that the change in the CO binding energy is proportional to the
shift of the d-band center of the metal overlayer. The adsorption
of CO showed an increased binding energy in comparison with
Pt(1 1 1), due to the larger lattice constant of Au, leading to an
expansion of Pt. The shift of d-band depends strongly on Au
coverage. The CO desorption temperature from an AuPt alloy
was shown to depend linearly on Au coverage [18]. The
understanding of how such a d-band shift applies for AuPt alloy
nanoparticles has important implications to the design of
bimetallic nanoparticle catalysts.
While the electrocatalytic activity of the bimetallic catalysts
for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) has been demonstrated
for AuPt nanoparticles prepared by molecular-capping based
chemical synthesis and subsequent assembly on carbon black
support and thermal activation treatment [19,20], the question
of how the bimetallic nanocrystal and surface alloy properties
are related to the surface binding and catalytic activities remain
unanswered. In view of the ﬁnding that the alloy properties of
the bimetallic AuPt nanoparticles are in sharp contrast to the
bimetallic miscibility gap known for the bulk counterparts in a
wide composition range (10–80% Au), there is a clear need to
assess the surface binding and the electrocatalytic properties of
the catalysts with different bimetallic compositions. We report
herein the recent results of an investigation of the CO
adsorption and the electrocatalytic MOR activities of AuPt
nanoparticle catalysts with different bimetallic composition.
The aim is to gain insights into the correlation between the
nanoscale core and surface properties over a wide range of
bimetallic composition [20,21].
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
Decanethiol (DT, 96%), oleylamine (OAM, 70%), hydrogen
tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl4, 99%), tetraoctylammonium bro-
mide (TOABr, 99%), hydrogen hexachloroplatinate (IV)
(H2PtCl6xH2O,
99.995%),
sodium
borohydride
(NaBH4,
99%), methanol (99.9%), ethanol (99.9%), silica gel (syloid
74) and Naﬁon (5 wt%) were purchased from Aldrich and used
as received. Other chemicals included hexane (99.9%) and
toluene (99.8%) from Fisher. Carbon black (Vulcan XC-72)
was obtained from Cabot. Water was puriﬁed with a Millipore
Milli-Q water system.
2.2. Synthesis of nanoparticles
TheAu,PtandAuPtcatalystswerepreparedbya combination
of two protocols. The ﬁrst involved a modiﬁed two-phase
synthesis [2,22] of nanoparticles of 2 nm core sizes with
different compositions (AumPt100m) capped with a mixed
monolayer of decanethiolate and oleylamine (as-synthesized
nanoparticles) [23,24]. The control of AuPt composition in the
range of 10–90% Au with 2–4 nm core sizes and high
monodispersity (<  0.5 nm) was achieved by manipulating
the precursor feed ratio. The second protocol involved assembly
of the as-synthesized nanoparticles on different supports (e.g.,
carbon (C) and silica (SiO2)) [21], followed by subsequent
thermal treatment under controlled temperature and atmosphere
[20]. The thermal treatment involved heating the catalyst at
300 8C under 20% O2 followed by treatment at 400–600 8C
under 15% H2. It has been found that the temperature range of
400–500 8C is the most appropriate thermal treatment condition
for both the electrocatalytic and the alloying properties [2]. The
actual loading ranged from 2.5 to 5.4% by mass for typical
samples. The silica-loaded nanoparticles were thermally treated
under controlled atmosphere and temperature, including shell
removal under 300 8C with 20% O2/N2 for 1 h and calcination
under 400 8C with 15% H2/N2 for 2 h. Several nanoparticle
samples were synthesized and subsequently studied in this paper,
which are listed in Table 1.
2.3. Preparation of catalysts on electrodes
Glassy carbon (GC) disks (geometric area: 0.07 cm2) were
polished with 0.03 mm Al2O3 powders. The geometric area of
the substrate electrode (glassy carbon), not the surface area of
the catalyst itself, provides a measure of the loading of catalyst
on the electrode surface. A typical suspension of the catalysts
was prepared by adding 1 mg catalyst (AuPt/C) to 1 mL of
0.25% Naﬁon solution, and sonicating for 15 min. The
suspension was stable for several days. The suspension was
then quantitatively transferred to the surface of the polished GC
disk. The electrodes were dried overnight at room temperature.

2.4. Measurements
Direct current plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (DCP-
AES) was employed to analyze the composition of the
as-synthesized bimetallic nanoparticles and the thermally
treated nanoparticles on supports (carbon black or SiO2) using
an ARL Fisons SS-7 DCP-AES instrument, the measurements
were made on emission peaks at 267.59 and 265.95 nm for Au
and Pt, respectively. The nanoparticle samples were dissolved
in concentrated aqua regia, and then diluted to concentrations in
the range of 1–50 ppm for analysis. Calibration curves were
made from dissolved standards with concentrations from 0 to
50 ppm in the same acid matrix as the unknowns. Standards and
unknowns were analyzed 10 times each for 3 s counts.
Instrument reproducibility, for concentrations greater than
100 times the detection limit, results in <  2% error. For
example, the DCP analysis of the bimetallic nanoparticles
synthesized under the above conditions yielded an atomic
composition of 35% Au and 65% Pt. The nanoparticles of this
composition is denoted as Au35Pt65.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on
a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope (100 kV). For TEM
measurements, samples were suspended in hexane solution and
were cast by dropping the nanoparticle solution onto a carbon-
coated copper grid followed by solvent evaporation in air at
room temperature.
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data were collected on a
Philips
X’Pert
diffractometer
using
Cu
Ka
radiation
(l = 1.5418 A
˚ ). The measurements were done in reﬂection
geometry and the diffraction (Bragg) angles 2u were scanned at
a step of 0.0258. Each data point was measured for at least 20 s
and several scans were taken of each sample.
Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were acquired on
a Nicolet Magna 760 spectrometer. The sample cell for the FT-
IR measurement consists of a glass tube with two windows and
two gas-ﬂow valves on the side, which allowed for purging with
nitrogen and CO. The thermally treated catalysts were ground
into ﬁne powders and pressed into a pellet, which was mounted
inside the glass tube on a NaCl window plate. Sixty-four scans
were collected for each spectrum with a resolution of 4 cm1.
Spectra were acquired at room temperature by ﬁrst purging the
chamber with nitrogen and then taking a background spectrum.
The chamber was then purged with 4% CO in nitrogen (for
10 min), and a spectrum was taken. By subtracting the spectrum
of the gas-phase CO (2171 and 2119 cm1) generated in a
separate measurement under the same conditions without the
catalyst, the resulting spectrum was obtained that corresponded
to the CO molecules adsorbed on the catalyst. In the present
study, we focused on the relative shift of the CO adsorption
bands by keeping the same preparation and measurement
conditions. The gas-phase CO can be purged away in less than
5 min. The resolution did not constitute an issue to affect the
data assessment. All spectra were baseline corrected and water
subtracted.
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were per-
formed using a microcomputer-controlled electrochemical
analyzer (CHI600a, CH Instruments), using three-electrode
electrochemical cells at room temperature. All electrolytic
solutions were de-aerated with high purity argon or nitrogen
before the measurement. The potentials are given with respect
to the reference electrode of Ag/AgCl saturated KCl.
3. Results and discussion
The discussion of the experimental results is divided into
three
sections.
In
the
ﬁrst
section,
the
morphological,
composition and structural properties of the bimetallic alloy
nanoparticle catalysts are described. The second section
discusses the results of an investigation of the CO adsorption
using FT-IR. The results allowed us to establish the correlation
between the bimetallic composition in the nanoparticles and the
strength of CO adsorption of the bimetallic catalysts. The third
section describes the results from the characterization of the
electrocatalytic MOR activity.
3.1. Morphological, composition and structural properties
AumPt100m nanoparticles with different atomic composi-
tions ranging from m  10 to 90% Au have been synthesized by
the method described in Section 2. Varying the feeding ratio of
the metal precursors used in the synthesis controlled the
bimetallic composition of the nanoparticles. The average sizes
of the as-synthesized particles determined from TEM data are
2.2  0.2 nm for Au, 4.8  0.8 nm for Pt and 1.8  0.6 nm for
Au82Pt18 nanoparticles [2]. While the average sizes were
slightly increased for the nanoparticles on SiO2 after thermal
treatment (e.g., 3.8  0.7 nm for Au/SiO2 and 3.3  0.4 for
Au82Pt18/SiO2) in comparison with the as-synthesized particles
(likely due to sintering effect), they displayed high mono-
dispersity. Each sample shown in Table 1 was analyzed using
TEM for size and morphology. It was found that all samples had
similar sizes. Fig. 1A shows a typical TEM micrograph for the
carbon-supported AuPt nanoparticles after thermal treatment
(example: Au82Pt18). The high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 1A,
bottom inset) indicates that the thermally treated nanoparticles
exhibit a highly crystalline morphology. As demonstrated in our
earlier report [25], there are two important pieces of evidence
supporting the effective removal of the capping monolayers
from the nanoparticles by the thermal-treatment process. First,
the vibrational bands characteristic of the capping molecules in
the C–H stretching region (na(CH3), 2955 cm1; ns(CH3),
2872 cm1; na(CH2), 2917 cm1; ns(CH2), 2848 cm1) were
not detected by FT-IR. Secondly, XPS analysis showed that the
bands associated with sulfur species (S(2p1/2), 163.8 eV; S(2p3/
2), 162.5 eV) were absent after the thermal treatment.
A close examination of the XRD data for AuPt nanoparticles
over a wide range of bimetallic composition [2] provides
important information for assessing the phase properties of
these bimetallic nanomaterials. In contrast to the bulk Au-Pt
counterparts which display a miscibility gap at 20–90% Au [3],
as shown by the open circle data points and lines in Fig. 1B, the
lattice parameters of the bimetallic nanoparticles, as shown by
the half ﬁlled circle data points and lines, were found to scale
linearly with Pt%. Such a relationship follows a Vegard’s type

380
law typically observed with binary metallic alloys, demonstrat-
ing the alloy properties for the bimetallic AuPt nanoparticles
[2]. The XRD pattern for Au52Pt48 synthesized using the
different protocol also showed alloy feature [26].
The thermal treatment of the catalysts is also believed to
inﬂuence the core and the surface crystallinity properties of the
nanocrystals. As stated in Section 1 on our recent XRD study
[2], the carbon-supported AuPt nanoparticles treated at 500 8C
exhibit single-phase characteristics as demonstrated by the
linear relationship between the lattice parameters and the
composition. While the diffraction patterns are characteristic of
the fcc-type lattice, there are subtle differences in peak shape,
width and position. The lattice parameters were determined for
each AuPt sample by carefully determining the positions of the
Bragg peaks in the diffraction patterns. The Bragg peaks (2u)
for the (1 1 1) plane are found at 38.6 or 38.3 for 400 or 500 8C
for treated Au82Pt18 samples, respectively [22]. It seems that the
relative changes in peak width and symmetry are more
signiﬁcant than that in peak position, which likely suggests a
higher degree of crystallinity for the catalysts treated at 500 8C
in comparison with that at 400 8C. There was also a slight
increase in particle size, and the estimate from the XRD peak
widths (from the (1 1 1) peak) yielded 4.2 (0.5 nm) and
5.0 nm (0.5 nm) after the treatment after 400 and 500 8C,
respectively, which are close to those determined from TEM
data [22]. Upon further increasing the treatment temperature to
higher than 650 8C, experiments revealed indications of
phase-segregation and larger particle sizes. In addition, the
values for the lattice parameter of the nanoscale AuPt are all
smaller than those for the bulk AuPt. This intriguing
phenomenon suggests that nanoparticles have smaller inter-
atomic distances than those for the bulk counterparts [27]. To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst example demonstrating that the
nanoscale AuPt nanoparticles not only have single-phase
character but also small inter-atomic distances in the entire
bimetallic composition range, both which are in sharp contrast
to those known for their bulk counterparts.
3.2. CO adsorption
A comparison among infrared spectra for CO adsorption on
AuPt nanoparticles over a wide range of bimetallic composition
provides important information for assessing the surface
binding properties of these bimetallic nanomaterials. All of
the samples here were immediately analyzed after removing
them from the tube furnace after the thermal treatment to
minimize poisoning and deactivation effects of adsorbed
species. We have also performed heating experiments, but we
did not observe any water effects for samples prepared this way.
In addition, we observed no indication of additional adsorbed
species in our analysis. There was no indication of CO2 in the
spectra of these samples. By comparing CO spectra for Au/
SiO2, Pt/SiO2, physical mixtures of Au/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2, and
an Au72Pt28/SiO2 alloy, the CO bands for the bimetallic alloy
catalyst are detected at 2115 and 2066 cm1, which are
distinctively different from the single band feature at 2115-
cm1 for CO linearly adsorbed on atop sites of Au [4,28–30],
and the single band feature at 2096-cm1 for CO on atop sites
for Pt [4,31]. The observation of single bands for CO adsorbed
on both Au and Pt sites is in agreement with observations
reported in two previous studies [6,7] for gold-platinum
bimetallic
catalysts
synthesized
by
other
methods.
For
example, for AuPt prepared by a 1:1-feeding ratio in a
dendrimer-based synthesis [7], the observed 2113-cm1 band
was attributed to adsorption on Au sites though the band for CO
on monometallic gold was not detected, and a 2063-cm1 band
was attributed to CO on Pt sites which was explained due to
dilution and dipole coupling effects. For the cluster-derived
AuPt bimetallic catalyst [6], the observed 2117-cm1 band was
similarly attributed to CO adsorbed to Au sites and the observed
2064-cm1 band was assigned to CO at Pt sites due to an
electronic effect caused by the incorporation of Au to the
bimetallic catalyst and not the dipolar coupling effect as
supported by 13CO data.
Fig. 2 shows a representative set of FT-IR spectra comparing
CO adsorption on AuPt/SiO2 with a wide range of bimetallic
compositions. Two most important features can be observed
from the spectral evolution as a function of bimetallic
composition. First, the 2115-cm1 band observed for Au/
SiO2 (a) displays a clear trend of diminishing absorbance as Pt

concentration increases in the bimetallic catalysts. It is very
interesting that this band becomes insigniﬁcant or even absent
at >  45% Pt. Secondly, the lower wavenumber CO band
(2050 cm1) shows a clear trend of shift towards that for the
Pt-atop CO band observed for Pt/SiO2 (i) as Pt concentration
increases. This trend is shown in Fig. 3. For higher
concentrations of Au, this band is strong and broad. Such a
dependence of the CO bands on the bimetallic concentration is
remarkable, and is to our knowledge observed for the ﬁrst time.
The higher wavenumber band (2115 cm1) is attributed to CO
adsorption on Au-atop sites in a Au-rich surface environment,
whereas the lower wavenumber band and its composition-
dependent shift reﬂect an electronic effect of the surface Pt-atop
sites alloyed in the bimetallic nanocrystal. The fact that the
disappearance of the Au-atop CO band at >  45% Pt is
accompanied by a gradual shift of the Pt-atop CO band is
indicative of a unique synergistic surface property in which the
Pt-atop CO adsorption is greatly favored over the Au-atop CO
adsorption. The observation of heightened CO band intensity
for some samples could be a result of the unique activity of the
catalyst, which is part of our on-going investigation. To
understand this preference, we must understand how Au atoms
surrounding Pt atoms produce an electronic effect on the
binding properties of CO on Pt.
The understanding of the electronic effect is based on the
correlation between the spectral features and ﬁndings from a
previous DFT calculation on the d-band of Pt atoms in
bimetallic AuPt surfaces [17]. The DFT calculation showed that
the d-band center of Pt atoms increases with Au concentration
in the AuPt alloy on a Au(1 1 1) or Pt(1 1 1) substrate. For an
AuPt alloy on Au(1 1 1), the d-band center of Pt atoms was
found to show an increase from 0 to 65–70% Au, after which a
slight decrease was observed. For a AuPt alloy on Pt(1 1 1), the
d-band center of Pt atoms is found to increase almost linearly
with the concentration of Au. Both were supported by
experimental data in which the adsorption of CO showed an
increased binding energy in comparison with Pt(1 1 1), due to
the larger lattice constant of Au, leading to an expansion of Pt
[17,18]. Since the theoretical data for nanocrystal alloys are not
yet available, the average d-band shift for Pt atoms from these
two sets of DFT calculation results is included in Fig. 3 to
illustrate the general trend. Since the DFT results provide
information on the Pt surface binding properties, let us consider
that the maximum concentration of Pt atoms on the surface in
which each Pt atom is completely surrounded by Au atoms. The
Pt concentration is 33% for

(1 1 1) or 50% for 2  2
(1 0 0) for a single layer bimetallic surface, and 25% (1 1 1) or
16% (1 0 0) for a multi-layer structure [32]. An average of these
values would yield 30–33%, which coincides closely with the
observed maximum of the d-band for Pt atoms in an AuPt alloy
on Au(1 1 1) [17]. Interestingly, a subtle transition for the
lower-wavenumber band, i.e., from a relatively broad band

feature to a narrow band feature that resembles that of the Pt-
atop CO band is observed to occur at 65% Au, below which
the Au-atop CO band basically disappeared. There exists a
stronger electron donation to the CO band by a Pt-atop site
surrounded by Au atoms in the bimetallic alloy surface than that
from the monometallic Pt surface as a consequence of the
upshift in d-band center of Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms,
which explains the preference of Pt-atop CO over the Au-atop
CO adsorption. The observed decrease of the Pt-atop CO band
frequency with increasing Au concentration is clearly in
agreement with the d-band theory for the bimetallic system
[17]. Note that the observed wavelength region of 2050–
2080 cm1 is quite close to those found recently based on DFT
calculations of CO adsorption on AuPt clusters (2030 and
2070 cm1) depending on the binding site (Pt or Au) [33,34].
It is important to note that the complete disappearance of the
Au-CO band for samples with a concentration below 65% Au
does not necessarily imply the absence of Au on the surface of
the nanoparticles; it implies rather the preferential Pt-atop CO
adsorption over Au-atop CO adsorption, which is supported by
the DFT calculation results [17]. This is an important ﬁnding, in
contrast to the linear trend observed for the lattice parameter of
the bimetallic alloy nanoparticles of different composition as
evidenced by the XRD data.
3.3. Electrocatalytic MOR activity
As an initial step to determine the electrocatalytic MOR
activity, the presence of Pt or Au on the surface of AuPt
nanoparticle catalysts was ﬁrst assessed by CV measurements
of the catalysts loaded on glassy carbon electrodes in acidic or
alkaline solution. In comparison with the redox waves for the
monometallic Au and Pt catalysts (in 0.5 M KOH) which
exhibit redox waves at 0.4 to 0.0 V for Pt and 0.0–0.4 V for
Au [19], the detection of the redox waves corresponding to Au
and Pt in the bimetallic Au72Pt28/C and Au35Pt65/C catalysts
(Fig. 4A) demonstrate the presence of a bimetallic surface
composition on the catalysts. This is consistent with the
bimetallic nanoparticle core composition.
In the absence of methanol, the catalysts exhibit redox waves
corresponding to gold and gold oxide on the surface. The gold
oxidation wave was found at 0.3 V whereas the reduction wave
was around 0.06–0.07 V for both catalysts. There seems to be a
subtle difference in the redox current, which is perhaps
suggestive of the surface composition difference. The AuPt/C
shows a methanol oxidation wave at around 0.15 V (Fig. 4B).
The methanol oxidation activity was also found to be dependent
on both composition and treatment temperature. Furthermore, a
smaller anodic wave is observed at 20 mV on the reverse
sweep for these AuPt/C catalysts, which is attributed to
oxidation of methanol on re-activated catalyst surface [35].
The catalytic modiﬁcation of the bimetallic composition is
in fact further reﬂected by the remarkable difference of the
voltammetric characteristic observed in the reverse scan,
especially in the alkaline electrolyte. For Pt/C, the reverse wave
for alkaline electrolyte occurs at a potential less positive than
the forward wave by 200 mV. In contrast, the reverse wave for
AuPt/C occurs at a potential which differs from the potential for
the wave in the forward sweep by only 20 mV. The relative
peak current of the reverse/forward wave is also found to be
dependent on Au% in the bimetallic nanoparticle. The oxides
formed on the catalyst surface at the potential beyond the
anodic peak potential in the positive sweep are reduced in the
reverse sweep [35]. Poisonous CO species formed on the Pt
surface can also be removed in the reverse sweep. The
observation of the more positive potential for the reverse wave
likely reﬂects the bimetallic effect on the re-activation of the
catalyst surface after the anodic sweep. The re-activation of the
surface catalytic sites after the anodic sweep is likely modiﬁed
by the presence of Au in the catalyst, which leads to a shift in
the peak potential of the reverse wave to a more positive
potential (by 200 mV) for AuPt/C than for Pt/C.
The correlation between the composition and the electro-
catalytic activity for the above catalysts is assessed by
analyzing the mass activity (i.e., the peak current density per
unit total mass of metals) and the kinetic parameters (Tafel
slope). Fig. 5 summarizes a representative set of results
showing the dependence of MOR mass activity on the
bimetallic composition. The dash lines show the general trend
for the entire composition range of AuPt alloy nanoparticles.
One of the signiﬁcant ﬁndings is that the mass activity for the
alkaline condition appears to exhibit a maximum around the
composition of 65–85% Au, which is remarkably close to the
composition range (65%Au) observed for the transition of the
band features (see Fig. 3). While the presence of Au in Pt
increases the lattice distance of Pt, the higher electronegativity
of Au than Pt could cause an increase of the amount of change
being transferred from Pt to Au, which was in fact supported by
high-resolution XPS data showing Au 4f7/2 binding energy
83.32 eV for Au/Pt and 83.87 eV bulk-like Au atoms [36], and

consequently, the increase of the d-orbital vacancy in the AuPt.
The composition was found to signiﬁcantly modify the
electrocatalytic properties of both Au and Pt. The ﬁnding that
the mass activity in the alkaline electrolyte exhibits a maximum
around 65–85% Au is in contrast to the small and gradual
increase from no activity of Au to high activity of Pt in the
acidic electrolyte. The variation of Tafel slope appears to be
relatively small (120 mV/dec). The display of the maximum
mass activity for AuPt/C catalysts comparable or higher than
that for Pt/C catalyst in the alkaline electrolyte is remarkable in
view of the fact that only 15–35% Pt was present in the catalyst.
To understand the origin, recent modeling results based on a
DFT calculation for CO adsorption on small clusters of AuPt
[17,34] are considered. The modeling results showed that the
CO adsorption energy increases with Pt% which maximize at
30% Pt for CO adsorption on Au atoms, and increases with
Pt% for CO adsorption on Pt atoms for all compositions. This is
important because it implies that gold atoms surrounding Pt
atoms in the AuPt alloy with a relatively high percentage of Au
may have played an important role in either removing the
intermediate CO-like species or providing oxygenated species
in the methanol oxidation process. This assessment is
consistent with the known facts that the nanoscale Au is
catalytically highly active for CO oxidation [1,37,38], and Au is
known to be capable of producing surface oxygenated species
in basic electrolytes [39,40].
We believe that a bifunctional electrocatalytic property may
be operative for the bimetallic catalysts in the alkaline
electrolyte. The similarity of the mass activity for the bimetallic
catalyst with 65–85% Au to those for pure Pt catalyst is
suggestive of the participation of Au in the catalytic reaction of
Pt. The alloy character for both the surface and the core of the
AuPt/C catalysts is supported by XRD data for the phase
properties and FT-IR data of CO adsorption to the catalysts.
Thus, the Pt atom for an AuPt alloy with 75% Au would be
practically surrounded by Au atoms. Scheme 1 illustrates the
proposed reaction pathway for the conversion of methanol to
carbonate ion mediated by a gold-platinum bimetallic catalyst.
While a detailed delineation of the proposed electrocatalytic
mechanism is part of our on-going work, several important
insights are supportive of the mechanistic view. The formation
of intermediate COad species on Pt is a well-known fact. The
transfer of the intermediate COad species from Pt-atop sites to
neighboring Au-atop sites is possible in view of the favorable
adsorption of CO on Au nanoparticles known from both
experimental measurements [1] and theoretical calculations
[17,34]. The formation of Au-OHad or surface oxides on gold in
alkaline electrolyte was in fact proposed to explain some of the
electrocatalytic properties observed for a gold electrode (e.g.,
incipient hydrous oxide/adatom mediator model [39]). Our
previous in situ measurements of the interfacial mass change
accompanying the electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol also
indicated the formation of Au oxides (Au2O3, AuOH or
Au(OH)3) on gold nanoparticle surfaces [40]. The bifunctional
activity in the alkaline electrolyte involves the participation of
CO and OH adsorption on Au sites in the catalytic reaction of Pt
in the alloy via a combination of reaction steps (see Scheme 1),
including the adsorption of MeOH on Pt followed by
dehydrogenation, the formation of intermediate COad/Pt, the
transfer of COad/Pt to neighboring Au-atop sites forming COad/
Au, and the reactions
of Pt-COad + Au-OHad and Au-
COad + Au-OHad towards the ﬁnal product (CO3
2).
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the AuPt nanoparticles have been shown to
exhibit bimetallic surface properties. This ﬁnding further led to
the correlation of the Au-atop and Pt-atop CO bands on the
surface of the alloy nanoparticles of a wide range of bimetallic
composition with the electronic effect as a result of the d-band
shift of Pt in the bimetallic nanocrystals. This ﬁnding, together

with previous ﬁndings of the nanocrystal core properties [2],
has provided the ﬁrst evidence that both the core and the surface
of the gold-platinum nanoparticles exhibit bimetallic alloy
properties. The ﬁnding of the maximum mass activity for
alkaline conditions around the composition of 65–85% Au
coincides remarkably with the ﬁnding of the composition of
65% Au for the transition of the band features for CO
adsorption, suggesting a synergistic effect of the surface
reactivity for Pt atoms surrounded by Au atoms in the alloyed
nanocrystal surface. Further quantitative correlation of the
ﬁndings with theoretical modeling based on density functional
theory [17,33,34,41] along with studies of the catalytic or
interfacial reactivities, will provide mechanistic details into
fundamental questions related to the bimetallic nanoparticles
and catalysts.
