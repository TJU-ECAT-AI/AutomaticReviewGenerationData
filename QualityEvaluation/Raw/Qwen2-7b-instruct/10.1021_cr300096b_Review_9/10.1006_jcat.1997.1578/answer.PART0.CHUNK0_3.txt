[1] "Bimetallic catalysts which consist of Mo and Pt have shown high activity in hydrogenolysis of alkanes (13) and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (4), while comparable ac- tivity was not observed for the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "Regarding the activities of CO hydrogenation, it was concluded that reduced Mo sites were responsible for the high activity and that Pt helped Mo sites become more reduced."
[3] "The coordination numbers of Mo/γ -Al2O3 are too small even considering the possibility of small particle sizes. Their shape is probably not sphere but like a raft."
[4] "The addition of Mo reduces the white line areas of Pt towards the values of Pt foil."
[5] "In CO hydrogenation over bimetallic catalysts, the active site should be reduced Mo with insignificant contribution from Pt sites."

1. Bimetallic catalysts consisting of Mo and Pt demonstrate high activity in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, whereas monometallic catalysts do not show similar activity. 

2. In the context of CO hydrogenation, the reduced Mo sites are identified as the active sites responsible for the high catalytic activity, with Pt playing a supportive role in facilitating the reduction of Mo sites.

3. The structure of Mo in the catalyst, when supported on alumina, is found to be irregular, resembling a raft-like shape, even when considering the possibility of small particle sizes.

4. The presence of Mo in the bimetallic catalyst leads to a reduction in the white line areas of Pt, suggesting a modification in the electronic state of Pt.

5. For CO hydrogenation reactions over bimetallic catalysts, the active site is determined to be the reduced Mo sites, with a negligible contribution from Pt sites.

1. 含有Mo和Pt的双金属催化剂在烷烃的氢解和环己烷的脱氢反应中表现出高活性，而单一金属催化剂则没有类似活性。

2. 在CO氢化反应中，研究指出还原后的Mo位点是活性中心，负责高催化活性，而Pt通过帮助Mo位点进一步还原起辅助作用。

3. 当Mo在氧化铝支持下作为催化剂时，其结构发现不规则，类似于筏状结构，即使考虑可能的小颗粒大小也是如此。

4. Mo的存在导致Pt的白线区域减少，表明Pt的电子状态发生了改变。

5. 对于使用双金属催化剂进行CO氢化反应，活性中心确定为还原后的Mo位点，Pt位点的贡献相对较小。
