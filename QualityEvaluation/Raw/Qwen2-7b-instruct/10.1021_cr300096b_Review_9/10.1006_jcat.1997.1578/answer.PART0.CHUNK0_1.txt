[1] "Bimetallic catalysts which consist of Mo and Pt have shown high activity in hydrogenolysis of alkanes (13) and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (4), while comparable acitivity was not observed for the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "For PtMo catalyst, Samant et al. have employed EXAFS and anomalous wide-angle X-ray scattering (AWAXS) to investigate the structure of PtMo bimetallic clusters which were prepared by the deposition of Mo(CO)6 vapor on preformed Pt/Yzeolites (9, 10)."
[3] "In CO hydrogenation over bimetallic catalysts, the active site should be reduced Mo with insignificant contribution from Pt sites."

1. Bimetallic catalysts containing Mo and Pt exhibit high activity in the hydrogenolysis of alkanes and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, whereas monometallic catalysts do not show comparable activity.
2. Samant et al. utilized EXAFS and AWAXS to examine the structure of PtMo bimetallic clusters created by depositing Mo(CO)6 vapor onto preformed Pt/Y zeolites.
3. In the CO hydrogenation reaction over bimetallic catalysts, the active site is believed to be reduced molybdenum, with negligible contribution from platinum sites.
4. XAFS revealed the formation of PtMo alloy clusters on gamma-alumina when bimetallic catalysts were synthesized through the impregnation of metal salts.

1. 含有Mo和Pt的双金属催化剂在烷烃氢解和环己烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性，而单一金属催化剂没有表现出相似的活性。
2. Samant等人通过将Mo(CO)6蒸气沉积到预形成的Pt/Y沸石上，利用EXAFS和AWAXS研究了PtMo双金属簇的结构。
3. 在双金属催化剂的CO氢化反应中，活性位点被认为是还原后的Mo，来自Pt的贡献很小。
4. XAFS表明，在通过金属盐浸渍合成双金属催化剂时，在γ-氧化铝上形成了PtMo合金簇。
