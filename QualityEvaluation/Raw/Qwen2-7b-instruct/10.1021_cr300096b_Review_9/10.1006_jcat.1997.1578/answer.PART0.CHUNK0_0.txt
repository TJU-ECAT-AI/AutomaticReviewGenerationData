[1] "The literature focuses on the characterization of PtMo bimetallic catalysts for CO hydrogenation."
[2] "Bimetallic catalysts which consist of Mo and Pt have shown high activity in hydrogenolysis of alkanes (13) and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (4), while comparable ac- tivity was not observed for the monometallic catalysts."
[3] "The structure of MoPt bimetallic catalysts, which were prepared by incipient wetness impreg- nation of γ -alumina with the variation of the order of Mo and Pt addition, was studied by XAFS and CO chemisorption."
[4] "The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) has been of great use in studying the structure of supported catalysts, and of multicomponent catalysts in particular."
[5] "The results of curve fitting of PtMo/γ -Al2O3 summarized in Table 3 confirm this observation."
[6] "All bimetallic catalysts showed higher CO conversions and, in most cases, higher TOF values than monometallic catalysts for CO hydrogenation."
[7] "As the reduction temperature increased, XANES of Mo K-edge (Fig. 4B) for the catalysts became more similar to that of Mo foil, indicating the existence of more metallic Mo phase."
[8] "The addition of Mo reduces the white line areas of Pt towards the values of Pt foil."
[9] "In CO hydrogenation over bimetallic catalysts, the active site should be reduced Mo and the addition of Pt may have helped the reduction of molybdenum (22)."
[10] "Reduced Mo appeared to be the active sites for the reaction and Pt seemed to help Mo sites become more reduced."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process is studied and optimized across theoretical and experimental domains employing methodologies such as XAFS (X-ray Absorption Fine Structure) and CO chemisorption. The selectivity and efficiency of the process are enhanced through the formation of PtMo alloy clusters, where molybdenum segregates to the surface and adjusts its metal-metal distance to that of platinum. The active sites for the reaction are reduced Mo, with the addition of Pt helping the reduction of molybdenum. Higher reduction temperatures lead to more metallic Mo phases and increased activity in CO hydrogenation.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用铂-镍等双金属催化剂，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域有重要贡献。这一过程在理论和实验领域通过XAFS（X射线吸收精细结构）和CO化学吸附等方法进行研究和优化，以提高选择性和效率。通过形成PtMo合金簇，钼倾向于聚集到表面，并调整其金属-金属距离接近铂的核心位置。反应的活性位点是还原的钼，而铂有助于钼位点的进一步还原。更高的还原温度导致更多的金属钼相，并且在CO氢化过程中表现出更高的活性。
