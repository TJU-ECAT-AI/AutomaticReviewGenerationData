[1] "Bimetallic catalysts which consist of Mo and Pt have shown high activity in hydrogenolysis of alkanes (13) and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (4), while comparable ac- tivity was not observed for the monometallic catalysts."
[2] "It was concluded that reduced Mo sites were responsible for the high activity and that Pt helped Mo sites become more reduced."
[3] "The addition of Mo reduces the white line areas of Pt towards the values of Pt foil."
[4] "The coordination numbers for Mo/γ -Al2O3 are too small even considering the possibility of small particle sizes. Their shape is probably not sphere but like a raft."
[5] "An interesting observation for the bimetallic catalysts is that the presence of the PtMo pair is indicated in RSF of Pt EXAFS by the asymmetric shape of the largest peak before performing curve fitting."
[6] "As indicated, as the reduction temperature increased, XANES of Mo K-edge (Fig. 4B) for the catalysts became more similar to that of Mo foil, indicating the existence of more metallic Mo phase."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains involve several key aspects:

1. **High Activity in Specific Reactions**: Bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Mo or Pt-Ni systems demonstrate high activity in reactions such as hydrogenolysis of alkanes and dehydrogenation of cyclohexane. This activity is often attributed to the synergistic effect of the two metals, where one metal modifies the electronic properties of the other, enhancing its catalytic performance.

2. **Active Sites Identification**: The active sites for the reaction are typically reduced Mo sites, with Pt helping Mo sites become more reduced. This insight comes from the observation that PtMo bimetallic catalysts are much more active in CO hydrogenation than their monometallic counterparts.

3. **Structural Characterization**: Techniques like X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) are crucial in understanding the structure of these bimetallic catalysts. XAFS analysis reveals that Mo segregates to the surface in the PtMo alloy clusters, adjusting its metal-metal distance to match that of the surrounding Pt atoms. This structure does not depend on the sequence of metal addition onto the support.

4. **Enhancing Selectivity and Efficiency**: The selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process can be optimized by controlling factors such as temperature, pressure, and the type of support material. The high reduction temperature tends to increase the degree of reduction of active Mo sites, leading to enhanced activity in CO hydrogenation.

5. **Theoretical and Experimental Domains**: Theoretical models, including computational chemistry simulations, complement experimental studies in elucidating the mechanisms behind the enhanced catalytic performance of bimetallic systems. These models can predict how changes in conditions affect the structure and reactivity of the catalysts.

In summary, the study of bimetallic catalysts for the hydrogenation of C═O bonds involves a combination of advanced analytical techniques, theoretical modeling, and careful experimental design to understand and optimize the catalytic performance, contributing significantly to the fields of fine chemical synthesis and biomass conversion.

在工业和研究领域，如精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化中，利用铂-镍等双金属催化剂对C═O键进行催化氢化具有重要意义。在理论和实验领域内，通过以下关键方面来研究、优化并提升该过程的选择性和效率：

1. **特定反应的高活性**：铂-钼或铂-镍系统等双金属催化剂在烷烃氢解和环己烷脱氢等反应中显示出高活性。这种活性通常归因于两种金属之间的协同效应，其中一种金属修改了另一种金属的电子性质，从而增强了其催化性能。

2. **活性位点识别**：催化反应的活性位点通常是还原的钼位点，而铂则帮助钼位点变得更加还原。这一见解源于观察到铂钼双金属催化剂在CO氢化反应中的活性远高于其单金属催化剂。

3. **结构表征**：通过X射线吸收精细结构（XAFS）技术等手段来理解这些双金属催化剂的结构。XAFS分析显示，钼倾向于在合金簇表面形成，调整其与周围铂原子间的金属-金属距离。这种结构不依赖于金属添加顺序。

4. **增强选择性和效率**：通过控制条件如温度、压力和支持材料类型等因素，可以优化氢化过程的选择性和效率。提高的还原温度往往会增加活性钼位点的还原度，从而在CO氢化反应中增强活性。

5. **理论与实验领域**：理论模型，包括计算化学模拟，与实验研究相结合，以揭示双金属系统的增强催化性能背后的机制。这些模型可以预测条件变化如何影响催化剂的结构和反应性。

综上所述，对于C═O键的氢化过程的研究涉及高级分析技术、理论建模和仔细的实验设计的结合，为精细化学品合成和生物质转化等领域做出了重大贡献。
