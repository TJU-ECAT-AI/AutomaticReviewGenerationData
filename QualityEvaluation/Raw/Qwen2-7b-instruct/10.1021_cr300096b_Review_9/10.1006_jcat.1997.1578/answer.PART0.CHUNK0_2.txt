[1] "The low activity of Pt/γ-Al2O3 is due to the intrinsic reactivity of the metal which is fully reduced as indicated by a large amount of CO chemisorption and XAFS results."
[2] "On the other hand, there exists significant difference between the XANES of Mo foil and that of Mo/γ-Al2O3."
[3] "The addition of Mo reduces the white line areas of Pt towards the values of Pt foil."
[4] "An interesting observation for the bimetallic catalysts is that the presence of the PtMo pair is indicated in RSF of Pt EXAFS by the asymmetric shape of the largest peak before performing curve fitting."

1. The low activity of platinum catalysts, like Pt/γ-Al2O3, is attributed to their complete reduction, as evidenced by extensive CO chemisorption and XAFS analysis. 
2. There is a notable difference in the XANES spectra between molybdenum foil and molybdenum catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3. 
3. Adding molybdenum reduces the white line areas of platinum, suggesting a shift towards a more active state akin to bulk platinum. 
4. The presence of the PtMo pair in bimetallic catalysts is indicated by the asymmetric shape of the largest peak in the Pt EXAFS spectrum before curve fitting.

1. 铂基催化剂，如Pt/γ-Al2O3的低活性归因于它们的完全还原，这是通过广泛的CO化学吸附和XAFS分析得出的。
2. 钼箔与γ-Al2O3上钼催化剂的XANES谱存在明显差异。
3. 添加钼降低了铂的白线面积，暗示向类似纯铂的更活跃状态转变。  
4. 在进行曲线拟合之前，钼铂对在Pt EXAFS谱中的最大峰的不对称形状表示了双金属催化剂中PtMo对的存在。
