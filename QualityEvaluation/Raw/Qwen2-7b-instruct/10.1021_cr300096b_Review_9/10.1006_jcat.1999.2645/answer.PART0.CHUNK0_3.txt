The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. These include fine chemical synthesis and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. Industrial applications benefit from the ability to selectively produce valuable chemicals from renewable resources. Research focuses on understanding, optimizing, and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of this process. Methodologies employed involve both theoretical studies, such as computational modeling to predict reaction pathways and catalyst properties, and experimental approaches, including catalyst preparation, characterization, and testing under various conditions.

The addition of metals like Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt to Ni enhances the reduction rate of Ni and significantly increases the catalytic activity for hydrogenating butyronitrile. This is primarily attributed to mixed ensembles within the surface of bimetal clusters. The interaction between Ru and Ni is notably stronger when RuCl3 is used as the precursor for RuNi catalyst preparation. The addition of Sn to Pt reduces the activity of Pt in hydrogenating acetonitrile, promoting the formation of secondary amine. Selectivity is influenced by the nature of the reactant, as ammonia shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of primary amine.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts allows for the selective production of valuable chemicals from renewable resources. The heat of chemisorption on mixed ensembles is between the values for the pure ensembles of the same size of either metal. The position of the maximum depends on the nature of the reactant. These findings contribute to both industrial applications and research advancements in the field of catalysis.

催化氢化C═O键使用双金属催化剂对各种工业和研究应用产生了重大影响。这些包括精细化学品合成和细胞质生物质转换。工业应用从可再生资源中选择性地生产有价值化学物质中受益。研究的重点在于理解、优化和提高此过程的选择性和效率。采用的方法包括理论研究，如计算建模预测反应途径和催化剂性质，以及实验方法，如催化剂制备、表征和在不同条件下测试。

向镍添加Ru、Rh、Pd或Pt可以增强镍的还原速率并显著增加其对丁基腈氢化的催化活性。这主要归因于表面双金属簇中的混合集合。Ru与Ni之间的相互作用在使用RuCl3作为RuNi催化剂制备的前体时尤为强烈。将Sn添加到Pt中会降低Pt在氢化乙腈中的活性，促进次级胺的形成。选择性受反应物性质的影响，氨会将平衡转向初级胺的形成。

使用双金属催化剂进行C═O键催化氢化允许从可再生资源选择性地生产有价值的化学品。混合集合上化学吸附热介于同一大小金属纯集合之间。最大位置取决于反应物的性质。这些发现对工业应用和催化领域研究进步做出了贡献。
