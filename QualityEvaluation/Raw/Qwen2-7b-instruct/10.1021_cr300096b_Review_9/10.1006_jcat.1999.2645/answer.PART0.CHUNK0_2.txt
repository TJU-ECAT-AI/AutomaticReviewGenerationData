[1] "The present findings on reducibility enhancement are in line with general experience. The reduction of metal ions by H2 to metal particles can be visualized as consisting of two main steps: nucleation and then growth. In bimetallic systems the noble metal will be reduced first; ions of the second metal can attach themselves to the clusters of the noble metal, where H2 will be dissociatively adsorbed."
[2] "With RuNi, alloy formation in zeolite cages is more complicated. TPR results indicate that ruthenium has a smaller effect than other transition metals on the enhancement of the reducibility of nickel when Ru(NH3)3+ 6 is used as the precursor."
[3] "Turning now to activity and selectivity, it is obvious from the present results that the conversion over alloyed Ni catalysts is much higher than over monometallic Ni; the enhancement exceeds the amount predicted on the basis of additivity or enhanced reducibility of the nickel."
[4] "The results on the activity changes due to alloying can thus be rationalized in terms of mixed ensembles with intermediate heat of adsorption. The catalytic reaction rate will be higher than that of the most active alloy partner, if the heats of chemisorption on both pure metals are located at different sides of the volcano-shaped curve."
[5] "The present results further show not only that addition of ammonia to the reactant mixture shifts the equilibrium of the three amines toward the primary amine, as predicted by thermodynamics, but also that ammonia also interferes with the reaction mechanism. As a strong competitor for active sites, it lowers the reaction rate significantly."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic catalysts enhance the reduction rate of metals, increasing the efficiency and selectivity of the hydrogenation process. The methodologies employed involve studying the properties of mixed ensembles with intermediate heat of adsorption, optimizing the catalytic activity based on the volcano-shaped relationship between catalytic activity and heat of adsorption, and understanding how additives like ammonia affect the reaction mechanism and equilibrium. This approach allows for the rationalization and enhancement of the selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process.
