[1] "Addition of Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt to Ni/NaY enhances the reduction rate of Ni and strongly increases the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of butyronitrile. The enhanced activity is predominantly attributed to mixed ensembles in the surface of bimetal clusters."
[2] "Addition of Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt to Cu/NaY enhances the reduction rate of Cu2+ but lowers the activity for acetonitrile hydrogenation. All CuM/NaY catalysts show high selectivity to secondary amine."
[3] "Addition of Sn to Pt lowers the activity of Pt for acetonitrile hydrogenation and promotes the formation of secondary amine."
[4] "Strong interaction between Ru and Ni is obtained if RuCl3 is used as the precursor for the preparation of RuNi/NaY."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. The methodologies employed include studying, optimizing, and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains. 

2. The addition of Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt to Ni catalysts enhances the reduction rate and catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of butyronitrile. This is attributed to the formation of mixed ensembles on the surface of bimetallic clusters.

3. The addition of Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt to Cu catalysts enhances the reduction rate of Cu2+, but decreases the activity for acetonitrile hydrogenation. These catalysts show high selectivity towards secondary amine.

4. The addition of Sn to Pt catalysts decreases the activity for acetonitrile hydrogenation while promoting the formation of secondary amine.

5. The strong interaction between Ru and Ni is achieved when RuCl3 is used as the precursor for the preparation of RuNi catalysts.

6. Ammonia reduces the reaction rate but improves the formation of primary amine.

1. C═O键的催化氢化使用如Pt-Ni这样的双金属催化剂，在精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等工业和研究应用中发挥了作用。采用的方法包括理论和实验领域的研究、优化和提高此过程的选择性和效率。

2. 向Ni催化剂添加Ru、Rh、Pd或Pt可以增强丁腈氢化反应的还原速率和催化活性。这主要归因于表面双金属簇中混合团簇的形成。

3. 向Cu催化剂添加Ru、Rh、Pd或Pt可以增强Cu2+的还原速率，但降低丙酮氰醇氢化活性。这些催化剂对二级胺具有高选择性。

4. 向Pt催化剂添加Sn会降低丙酮氰醇氢化活性，同时促进二级胺的形成。

5. 当使用RuCl3作为制备RuNi催化剂的前体时，可以获得Ru与Ni之间的强相互作用。

6. 氨气降低了反应速率，但提高了初级胺的形成。
