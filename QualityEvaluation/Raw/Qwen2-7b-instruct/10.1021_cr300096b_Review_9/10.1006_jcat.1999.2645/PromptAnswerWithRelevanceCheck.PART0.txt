[1] "The present findings on reducibility enhancement are in line with general experience. The reduction of metal ions by H2 to metal particles can be visualized as consisting of two main steps: nucleation and then growth. In bimetallic systems the noble metal will be reduced first; ions of the second metal can attach themselves to the clusters of the noble metal, where H2 will be dissociatively adsorbed."
[2] "With RuNi, alloy formation in zeolite cages is more complicated. TPR results indicate that ruthenium has a smaller effect than other transition metals on the enhancement of the reducibility of nickel when Ru(NH3)3+ 6 is used as the precursor."
[3] "Turning now to activity and selectivity, it is obvious from the present results that the conversion over alloyed Ni catalysts is much higher than over monometallic Ni; the enhancement exceeds the amount predicted on the basis of additivity or enhanced reducibility of the nickel."
[4] "The results on the activity changes due to alloying can thus be rationalized in terms of mixed ensembles with intermediate heat of adsorption. The catalytic reaction rate will be higher than that of the most active alloy partner, if the heats of chemisorption on both pure metals are located at different sides of the volcano-shaped curve."
[5] "The present results further show not only that addition of ammonia to the reactant mixture shifts the equilibrium of the three amines toward the primary amine, as predicted by thermodynamics, but also that ammonia also interferes with the reaction mechanism. As a strong competitor for active sites, it lowers the reaction rate significantly."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications. These include fine chemical synthesis and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. Industrial applications benefit from the ability to selectively produce valuable chemicals from renewable resources. Research focuses on understanding, optimizing, and enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of this process. Methodologies employed involve both theoretical studies, such as computational modeling to predict reaction pathways and catalyst properties, and experimental approaches, including catalyst preparation, characterization, and testing under various conditions.

The addition of metals like Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt to Ni enhances the reduction rate of Ni and significantly increases the catalytic activity for hydrogenating butyronitrile. This is primarily attributed to mixed ensembles within the surface of bimetal clusters. The interaction between Ru and Ni is notably stronger when RuCl3 is used as the precursor for RuNi catalyst preparation. The addition of Sn to Pt reduces the activity of Pt in hydrogenating acetonitrile, promoting the formation of secondary amine. Selectivity is influenced by the nature of the reactant, as ammonia shifts the equilibrium towards the formation of primary amine.

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts allows for the selective production of valuable chemicals from renewable resources. The heat of chemisorption on mixed ensembles is between the values for the pure ensembles of the same size of either metal. The position of the maximum depends on the nature of the reactant. These findings contribute to both industrial applications and research advancements in the field of catalysis.

向镍添加Ru、Rh、Pd或Pt可以增强镍的还原速率并显著增加其对丁基腈氢化的催化活性。这主要归因于表面双金属簇中的混合集合。Ru与Ni之间的相互作用在使用RuCl3作为RuNi催化剂制备的前体时尤为强烈。将Sn添加到Pt中会降低Pt在氢化乙腈中的活性，促进次级胺的形成。选择性受反应物性质的影响，氨会将平衡转向初级胺的形成。

使用双金属催化剂进行C═O键催化氢化允许从可再生资源选择性地生产有价值的化学品。混合集合上化学吸附热介于同一大小金属纯集合之间。最大位置取决于反应物的性质。这些发现对工业应用和催化领域研究进步做出了贡献。

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Studies employ methodologies that involve understanding the catalytic activity and selectivity, optimizing the reaction conditions, and enhancing the efficiency of the process. The selectivity and efficiency of the process can be improved by studying the interactions between metals in the bimetallic catalysts, such as the formation of mixed ensembles that have intermediate heats of adsorption, leading to higher catalytic activity.

2. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds include theoretical calculations based on the Balandin theory, which predicts a volcano-shaped curve relating the catalytic activity to the heat of adsorption. Experimental studies involve preparing bimetallic catalysts, characterizing their properties, and testing their performance under various conditions. Theoretical and experimental data are then correlated to understand the underlying mechanisms and to design more efficient catalysts.

3. The efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process can be influenced by factors such as the heat of chemisorption on mixed ensembles formed by the interaction of metals in the catalyst. If the heats of chemisorption on both pure metals are located at different sides of the volcano-shaped curve, the catalytic reaction rate will be higher than that of the most active alloy partner.

4. The interaction between metals in bimetallic catalysts can lead to enhanced reducibility and activity. For instance, the presence of metals like Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt can enhance the reduction of Ni, promoting the hydrogenation of butyronitrile. This enhanced activity is attributed to mixed ensembles formed on the surface of bimetal clusters.

5. When metals like Ru, Rh, Pd, or Pt are added to Cu-based catalysts, the reduction rate of Cu2+ is enhanced, but the activity for acetonitrile hydrogenation is lowered. This indicates that the bimetallic CuM/NaY catalysts show high selectivity towards secondary amine formation.
