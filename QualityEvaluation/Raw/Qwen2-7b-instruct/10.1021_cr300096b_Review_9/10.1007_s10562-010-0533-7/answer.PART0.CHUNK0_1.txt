The study aimed to create a highly efficient and stable catalyst for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride at low temperatures, targeting high selectivity and activity. The HYAl2O3 support proved to be the most effective. The introduction of a small amount of Pt to the Ni catalyst enhanced its selectivity and activity. Furthermore, the PtNi system was capable of converting maleic acid into succinic acid with 100% conversion at 40 C. The effectiveness of the PtNi bimetallic catalyst was linked to the degree of bimetallic bond formation, as observed through XRD and TPR analysis.

本研究旨在开发一种高效稳定的催化剂，用于在较低温度下氢化马来酸酐以产生高选择性SA。HYAl2O3支持表现出了最高的活性和选择性。向Ni催化剂中添加少量Pt可以提高其选择性和活性。此外，PtNi系统能够在40°C时将马来酸酐直接转化为琥珀酸，转化率高达100%。PtNi双金属催化剂的有效性与金属间二元合金键形成程度有关，这通过XRD和TPR分析得到了证实。
