<p>It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts.</p>
<p>In a recently published work by the authors [13], hydrogenation of maleic anhydride was investigated over Ni-loaded zeolites catalysts. The results indicated that zeolites were excellent supports for SA production from MA hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study was to develop a highly efficient, more stable catalyst for hydrogenation of maleic anhydride at relatively low temperature to produce SA with high selectivity.</p>
<p>Moreover, the results of the investigation of hydrogenation of MA on the selected NiPt/HYAl2O3 catalyst at 40 C and the deactivation of a reason were reported.</p>
<p>Owning to the high activity of PtNi for MA hydrogenation and the fact that MA is the main precursor for the production of succinic acid, we have also carried out the catalytic synthesis of succinic acid starting from maleic acid at 40 C, this help the viability and economics of the process.</p>
<p>It has been reported that large and medium pore supports display higher activities compared to smaller pore size ones [16]. However, we found that using large pore Al2O3 as supports decreased the conversion of hydrogenation of MA.</p>
<p>As can be seen the selectivity to SA parallels the increase of conversion, starting from an initial value of 42% and reaching 83%.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a process of deactivation in the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in the presence of PtNi metal catalysts is caused by the formation of H2O that would cover the active surface and prevent the adsorption of maleic anhydride.</p>
<p>In our case (see Fig. 9) more than 120 h of fast ageing (increased reaction temperature and higher WHSV) was carried out to observe only a 4% loss of activity.</p>
<p>Time on stream (TOS) studies showed the PtNi catalyst is not very active at the beginning of the test, but after an induction period of about 4 h the conversion raises steeply to 100%.</p>
<p>The PtNi catalyst showed high activity and stability at 40 C; No deactivation or change in product distribution was observed over 10 h TOS.</p>

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by offering distinct properties that differ from monometallic catalysts, leading to enhanced selectivity and efficiency. Studies employ methodologies to analyze, optimize, and improve this process across theoretical and experimental domains.

2. The bimetallic Pt-Ni catalysts demonstrate superior performance compared to their monometallic counterparts. This is attributed to the formation of PtNi bimetallic structures that offer higher hydrogenation activities, particularly at lower temperatures, which are crucial for industrial applications aiming to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.

3. The investigation focused on developing a highly efficient catalyst for the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride at a low temperature to produce succinic anhydride with high selectivity. The researchers optimized the catalyst composition, support materials, and reaction conditions to achieve this goal.

4. The study also explored the catalytic synthesis of succinic acid from maleic acid at 40°C, which is an economically viable and environmentally friendly approach. This process leverages the high activity of the PtNi catalyst for hydrogenation reactions, enabling the direct conversion of maleic acid to succinic acid, thereby avoiding additional steps and improving the overall efficiency of the process.

5. The use of large and medium pore supports generally enhances the activity of hydrogenation catalysts, whereas the use of large pore Al2O3 decreases the conversion of maleic anhydride hydrogenation. This finding highlights the importance of support selection in achieving optimal catalytic performance.

6. The PtNi catalyst shows high activity and stability at 40°C, even after prolonged operation. The selectivity of the maleic acid hydrogenation to succinic acid remains high, indicating that the catalyst maintains its efficiency and avoids deactivation over time, which is a significant advantage for industrial applications.

7. The results suggest that the PtNi catalysts are effective in hydrogenating C=C bonds in maleic acid, producing succinic acid with 100% conversion and high selectivity. This capability offers a promising avenue for the development of sustainable and efficient processes in the chemical industry.
