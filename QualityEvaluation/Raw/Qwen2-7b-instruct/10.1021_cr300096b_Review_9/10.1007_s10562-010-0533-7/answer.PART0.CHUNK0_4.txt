[1] "The reaction network for maleic anhydride (MA) hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 1. [13]. In this process, both hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions are involved."
[2] "Compared to the other processes, hydrogenation of maleic anhydride is the most direct, environmentally benign, and economic way to produce succinic anhydride."
[3] "The results show that HYAl2O3 supported PtNi bimetallic catalysts exhibit the best performance among all as-prepared bimetallic and monometallic catalysts, which is mainly due to the PtNi bimetallic formation."
[4] "For all the supports, PtNi bimetallic catalysts show higher hydrogenation activities than the corresponding monometallic catalysts."
[5] "Finally, we have shown that PtNi is able to catalyze the reaction for the production of succinic acid at 40 C with 100% conversion."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to industrial applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes allow for the efficient transformation of various organic compounds into valuable products. In the context of this study, the researchers aimed to develop highly active and selective catalysts for the low-temperature hydrogenation of maleic anhydride to succinic anhydride, and subsequently, the synthesis of succinic acid. The methodologies employed involve the preparation of catalysts through a kneading method and their evaluation using a flow reactor under specific conditions. The study highlights the strong influence of catalyst supports on the catalytic properties of both monometallic and bimetallic catalysts. The PtNi bimetallic catalysts supported on HYAl2O3 demonstrated the best performance, showing higher hydrogenation activities and selectivities compared to monometallic catalysts on the same support. The researchers successfully achieved 100% conversion of maleic anhydride to succinic anhydride at 40°C, and later, they synthesized succinic acid from maleic acid under similar conditions, further demonstrating the potential of PtNi catalysts for industrial applications at lower temperatures.
