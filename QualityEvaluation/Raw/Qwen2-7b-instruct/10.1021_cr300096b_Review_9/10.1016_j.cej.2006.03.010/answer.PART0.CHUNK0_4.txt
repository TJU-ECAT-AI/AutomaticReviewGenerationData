[1] "In view of this, it is a proper approximation to postulate the existence of three types of active sites, which we shall further denote as Z-, X- and Y-type."
[2] "Within the framework of the suggested model, these types of sites can be specified as follows: Z-type: Single Pt centers, facilitating dehydrogenation."
[3] "X-type: Catalytic clusters (ensembles) involving a number of Pt surface atoms in a proper configuration."
[4] "Y-type: Centers on the interfaces Pt/carrier (Yc) or Pt/promoter (Ya); Y = Yc + Ya."
[5] "It is of importance to note that in case the active phase is pure Pt (cat_1), the values of the coefficients in the denominators of the equations for r and rcr are identical, k2 = k5, which is an indication that the dehydrogenation and cracking steps occur on the same active sites."
[6] "The introduction of In or Sn promoters to Pt has resulted in acceleration of the dehydrogenation rate and in increase of the selectivity."
[7] "At the same time, the selectivityconversion curves exhibited on cat_2 and cat_3 give evidence of parallel proceeding of the dehydrogenation and cracking reactions."
[8] "The necessity to consider the key elementary steps proceeding on these types of active sites brings to the following reaction scheme."
[9] "According to experimental data obtained earlier [42], the limiting step for dehydrogenation is the removal of the first hydrogen atom via dissociative adsorption into HZ and half-hydrogenated intermediates, which undergo quick transformations."
[10] "Regarding the reaction scheme suggested above, steps 1 and 3 control the rate of dehydrogenation."
[11] "Considering that the contribution of the Z-sites is of major importance, the value of θ appreciably exceeding the value of (C1λ), the contribution of Y-sites may be disguised."
[12] "The introduction of promoters reduces the adsorption affinity of all types of sites."
[13] "In the presence of promoters, Y = Yc + Ya. Therefore, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation would increase."
[14] "Considering that cracking occurs onto Pt atoms engaged in X-sites inside the Pt islands, the apparent manifestation of the phenomenon may be interpreted as proceeding of dehydrogenation and cracking in parallel on independent sites."
[15] "It is essential to note that the proximity of the intermediates of adsorbed hydrogen [HZ], creates conditions for surface collisions resulting in breaking the chain of coke formation from these precursors."
[16] "Since the migration of the precursors is fast, it can be assumed that Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, following the relation."
[17] "Eq. (3) and (4) may be helpful in interpreting the fact that the dehydrogenation rate is affected upon attaining higher threshold values of coke depositions in the presence of promoters."

1. The model assumes the existence of three types of active sites - Z-, X-, and Y-type, to understand the behavior of catalytic systems involving multiple types of active sites. These sites differ in their adsorption ability, mode of action, and contribution to reaction routes.

2. The Z-type sites consist of single Pt centers that facilitate dehydrogenation. X-type sites are catalytic clusters of Pt atoms in proper configuration, responsible for cracking. Y-type sites are centers on the interfaces Pt/carrier or Pt/promoter, characterized by weaker adsorption strength.

3. In the case of a pure Pt catalyst (cat_1), dehydrogenation and cracking occur on the same active sites, indicated by identical coefficients in the equations for rates of reactions.

4. Promoters like In or Sn accelerate the dehydrogenation rate and increase selectivity. This is evidenced by the selectivity-conversion curves of cat_2 and cat_3, showing parallel dehydrogenation and cracking reactions.

5. The reaction scheme outlines key steps in the catalytic process, including adsorption, cracking, dehydrogenation, and formation of coke precursors.

6. The limiting step for dehydrogenation involves the removal of the first hydrogen atom, leading to quick transformations of intermediates.

7. Steps 1 and 3 in the reaction scheme control the rate of dehydrogenation. 

8. When the contribution of Z-sites is significant, their surface concentration exceeds that of Y-sites, potentially hiding the contribution of Y-sites to the catalytic action.

9. Promoters reduce the adsorption affinity of all types of sites, accelerating reactions and increasing selectivity.

10. With promoters, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation increases, potentially leading to parallel dehydrogenation and cracking reactions.

11. Cracking occurs onto Pt atoms engaged in X-sites inside the Pt islands, suggesting that dehydrogenation and cracking might happen on independent sites.

12. The proximity of hydrogen intermediates facilitates surface collisions, breaking the chain of coke formation.

13. The equilibrium between precursors Prec1 and Prec2 allows for the interpretation of the dehydrogenation rate's dependence on coke deposition thresholds in the presence of promoters.

1. 模型假设存在三种活性位点——Z、X和Y类型，以理解包含多种活性位点的催化系统的行为。这些位点在吸附能力、作用方式和反应途径贡献方面有所不同。

2. Z型位点由单个Pt中心组成，促进脱氢反应。X型位点是包含多个Pt原子的簇状结构，在适当配置下促进裂解。Y型位点位于Pt载体界面或Pt促进剂上，其吸附强度较弱。

3. 在纯Pt催化剂（cat_1）的情况下，脱氢和裂解发生在相同的活性位点上，这从方程中反应速率的分母中的系数相等可以得出。

4. In或Sn等促进剂加速了脱氢速率并提高了选择性。这通过cat_2和cat_3的选区转化曲线得到证据，显示了脱氢和裂解反应的平行进行。

5. 反应方案概述了催化过程的关键步骤，包括吸附、裂解、脱氢和焦炭前体形成。

6. 脱氢化限制步骤涉及移除第一个氢原子，导致中间体的快速转变。

7. 反应方案中的步骤1和3控制着脱氢速率。

8. 当Z位点的表面浓度显著超过(C1λ)值时，Y位点的贡献可能被掩盖。

9. 促进剂降低了所有类型位点的吸附能力，加快了反应速率并增加了选择性。

10. 有促进剂时，负责脱氢的Y位点数量增加，可能使脱氢和裂解反应在独立的位点上发生。

11. 裂解发生在Pt岛内的Pt原子参与的X位点上，这表明脱氢和裂解可能发生在独立的位点上。

12. 邻近氢中间体促进了表面碰撞，打断了焦炭生成链。

13. 前体Prec1和Prec2之间的平衡允许解释在有促进剂时焦炭沉积阈值依赖于脱氢速率的解释。
