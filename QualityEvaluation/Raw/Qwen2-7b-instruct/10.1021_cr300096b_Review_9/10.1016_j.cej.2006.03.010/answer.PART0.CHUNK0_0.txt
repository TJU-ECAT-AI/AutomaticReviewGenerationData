<p>It has been widely recognized that more than one type of active sites can be distinguished regarding the performance of supported platinum catalysts used for dehydrogenation and refining reactions. Promoting of the active phase with catalytically inactive metals such as Re, In, Ir and Sn is applied in view of increasing the catalyst activity, improving the selectivity and prolonging the catalyst lifetime.</p>
<p>It has been reported in ref.[12] for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst that, because of the lower strength of adsorption, coke precursors can migrate easily to the support, and this results in reduced coke accumulation over the active sites.</p>
<p>The capability of the promoting metal to weaken the adsorption of unsaturated species [33],[34],[35],[36],[37],[38],[39],[40] is considered to make for changing the location of coke through spill over the support also by the authors of refs.[18],[21],[33],[34],[35],[40].</p>
<p>It is of special interest for the present analysis the deactivation peculiarities which have been observed in the course of special experiments carried out [44],[46] to examine the influence of coke deposits on the main reaction rate, on the one side, and on the coke formation process, on the other.</p>
<p>According to experimental data obtained earlier [42], the limiting step for dehydrogenation is the removal of the first hydrogen atom via dissociative adsorption into HZ and half-hydrogenated intermediates, which undergo quick transformations. Regarding the reaction scheme suggested above, steps 1 and 3 control the rate of dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>In the presence of promoters, Y = Yc + Ya. Therefore, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation would increase. Possible change of the apparent kinetics may be caused by the fact that the equilibrium between Z- and Y-sites changes in favor of the fraction of Y-centers.</p>
<p>Since the migration of the precursors is fast, it can be assumed that Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, following the relation:(8)</p>
<p>λ denotes the fraction of unoccupied interfacial (Y-type) sites and ψ denotes the surface concentration of unoccupied X-type sites (catalytic clusters).</p>
<p>It can be assumed about the variation of r* in time (10)</p>
<p>Eq.(10) can be transformed into (13)</p>
<p>The coefficient Ks formally considers the impact of terminating the chain of coke formation (step 36 of the reaction scheme).</p>
<p>Regarding the first stage of the process, during which the coke formation rate r* is practically constant, it can be assumed (11)</p>
<p>Since the amount of coke increases in the course of this stage, (μ1/t) > 0, and it follows from Eqs.(10) and (11) that (12)</p>
<p>Eq.(12) can be transformed into (13)</p>
<p>It should be noted that λ = λc in case the process is carried out over cat_1 and λ = λc + λa for the cases of cat_2 and cat_3 which contain In or Sn as promoters.</p>
<p>Naturally, λc + λa > λc, or in the presence of promoters, the capacity of Y-type sites for keeping the quasi-stationary condition (13) would be higher.</p>
<p>Eqs.(3) and (4) may be helpful in interpreting the fact that the dehydrogenation rate is affected upon attaining higher threshold values of coke depositions in the presence of promoters.</p>

1. The promotion of the active phase with non-catalytic metals like Re, In, Ir, and Sn is utilized to increase catalyst activity, improve selectivity, and extend catalyst lifespan.
2. Promoters weaken the adsorption of unsaturated species, allowing coke precursors to migrate to the support, reducing coke accumulation on active sites.
3. The presence of promoters increases the number of Y-type sites, affecting the equilibrium between Z- and Y-sites and potentially altering the reaction kinetics.
4. The migration of precursors is fast, leading to an equilibrium between Prec1 and Prec2.
5. The rate of coke formation is influenced by the balance between Z- and Y-sites, with the presence of promoters enhancing the migration of precursors to interfacial sites.
6. The first stage of the process has a constant coke formation rate, followed by a decrease once the threshold amount of coke is reached.
7. In the presence of promoters, the capacity of Y-type sites to maintain a quasi-stationary condition is higher, influencing the deactivation pattern of the catalyst.
8. The dehydrogenation rate is affected by the presence of promoters, especially upon reaching higher threshold values of coke deposition.

1. 添加非催化金属如Re、In、Ir和Sn可以提高催化剂活性、改善选择性和延长催化剂寿命。
2. 推广剂削弱了不饱和物种的吸附，使得焦炭前体容易迁移到支撑物上，从而减少了活性位点上的焦炭积累。
3. 在促进剂的存在下，Y型位点的数量增加，影响了Z-和Y位点之间的平衡，可能改变了反应动力学。
4. 由于迁移速率快，前体之间达到了平衡状态。
5. 焦炭形成率受到Z-和Y位点平衡的影响，在促进剂的存在下，前体更容易迁移到界面位点。
6. 过程的第一阶段具有恒定的焦炭形成速率，随后在达到阈值焦炭量时减少。
