<p>It has been widely recognized that more than one type of active sites can be distinguished regarding the performance of supported platinum catalysts used for dehydrogenation and refining reactions. Promoting of the active phase with catalytically inactive metals such as Re, In, Ir and Sn is applied in view of increasing the catalyst activity, improving the selectivity and prolonging the catalyst lifetime.</p>
<p>It has been reported in ref.[12] for a PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst that, because of the lower strength of adsorption, coke precursors can migrate easily to the support, and this results in reduced coke accumulation over the active sites.</p>
<p>The capability of the promoting metal to weaken the adsorption of unsaturated species [33],[34],[35],[36],[37],[38],[39],[40] is considered to make for changing the location of coke through spill over the support also by the authors of refs.[18],[21],[33],[34],[35],[40].</p>
<p>It is of special interest for the present analysis the deactivation peculiarities which have been observed in the course of special experiments carried out [44],[46] to examine the influence of coke deposits on the main reaction rate, on the one side, and on the coke formation process, on the other.</p>
<p>According to experimental data obtained earlier [42], the limiting step for dehydrogenation is the removal of the first hydrogen atom via dissociative adsorption into HZ and half-hydrogenated intermediates, which undergo quick transformations. Regarding the reaction scheme suggested above, steps 1 and 3 control the rate of dehydrogenation.</p>
<p>In the presence of promoters, Y = Yc + Ya. Therefore, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation would increase. Possible change of the apparent kinetics may be caused by the fact that the equilibrium between Z- and Y-sites changes in favor of the fraction of Y-centers.</p>
<p>Since the migration of the precursors is fast, it can be assumed that Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, following the relation:(8)</p>
<p>λ denotes the fraction of unoccupied interfacial (Y-type) sites and ψ denotes the surface concentration of unoccupied X-type sites (catalytic clusters).</p>
<p>It can be assumed about the variation of r* in time (10)</p>
<p>Eq.(10) can be transformed into (13)</p>
<p>The coefficient Ks formally considers the impact of terminating the chain of coke formation (step 36 of the reaction scheme).</p>
<p>Regarding the first stage of the process, during which the coke formation rate r* is practically constant, it can be assumed (11)</p>
<p>Since the amount of coke increases in the course of this stage, (μ1/t) > 0, and it follows from Eqs.(10) and (11) that (12)</p>
<p>Eq.(12) can be transformed into (13)</p>
<p>It should be noted that λ = λc in case the process is carried out over cat_1 and λ = λc + λa for the cases of cat_2 and cat_3 which contain In or Sn as promoters.</p>
<p>Naturally, λc + λa > λc, or in the presence of promoters, the capacity of Y-type sites for keeping the quasi-stationary condition (13) would be higher.</p>
<p>Eqs.(3) and (4) may be helpful in interpreting the fact that the dehydrogenation rate is affected upon attaining higher threshold values of coke depositions in the presence of promoters.</p>

1. The promotion of the active phase with non-catalytic metals like Re, In, Ir, and Sn is utilized to increase catalyst activity, improve selectivity, and extend catalyst lifespan.
2. Promoters weaken the adsorption of unsaturated species, allowing coke precursors to migrate to the support, reducing coke accumulation on active sites.
3. The presence of promoters increases the number of Y-type sites, affecting the equilibrium between Z- and Y-sites and potentially altering the reaction kinetics.
4. The migration of precursors is fast, leading to an equilibrium between Prec1 and Prec2.
5. The rate of coke formation is influenced by the balance between Z- and Y-sites, with the presence of promoters enhancing the migration of precursors to interfacial sites.
6. The first stage of the process has a constant coke formation rate, followed by a decrease once the threshold amount of coke is reached.
7. In the presence of promoters, the capacity of Y-type sites to maintain a quasi-stationary condition is higher, influencing the deactivation pattern of the catalyst.
8. The dehydrogenation rate is affected by the presence of promoters, especially upon reaching higher threshold values of coke deposition.

[1] "In the presence of promoters, Y = Yc + Ya. Therefore, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation would increase."
[2] "Compared to Z-type sites, Ya-sites are supposed to be of weaker adsorption strength. Easier desorption of olefins formed on them is supposed to reduce the fraction of these sites which are out of action being blocked by adsorbed olefins."
[3] "The increased number of interfacial active sites, in combination with the provoked increase of their activity, is to bring the system to a point that the contribution of Y-type sites to dehydrogenation will be comparable, or even exceed the contribution of Z-sites."
[4] "Following this model, one can explain the experimentally observed conversion-selectivity curves relevant to the process in the presence of In or Sn, namely: the selectivity increases and becomes independent of conversion, what is characteristic of parallel proceeding."
[5] "It is essential to note that the proximity of the intermediates of adsorbed hydrogen [HZ], creates conditions for surface collisions resulting in breaking the chain of coke formation from these precursors."
[6] "This seems to be the most probable reason for the apparent observation that the Prec2 precursors evolve into coke more readily than the precursors inside the Pt domains."
[7] "Since the migration of the precursors is fast, it can be assumed that Prec1 and Prec2 are in equilibrium, following the relation:"
[8] "Under quasi-stationary conditions, while the main and cracking reactions do not feel the influence of coke, it can be assumed that λ, ψ and θH keep quasi-constant values."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic catalysts can enhance the efficiency and selectivity of this process, leading to more effective and environmentally friendly manufacturing techniques. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process span both theoretical and experimental domains.

For instance, researchers often employ computational simulations to predict the behavior of bimetallic catalysts under various conditions. This includes modeling the interaction between reactants and the catalyst surface, predicting product yields, and identifying optimal operating parameters. Additionally, experimental techniques such as spectroscopy, chromatography, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) are utilized to characterize the catalyst performance and understand the reaction mechanisms in detail.

In the context of cellulosic biomass conversion, bimetallic catalysts can facilitate the breakdown of complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars, which can then be fermented into biofuels or used as precursors for other valuable chemicals. The optimization of these catalysts involves tuning the composition and structure of the bimetallic nanoparticles to achieve high conversion rates, selectivities, and stability under industrial-scale conditions.

To enhance the selectivity and efficiency of the catalytic hydrogenation process, researchers focus on several strategies:
1. **Modifying Catalyst Composition**: By adjusting the ratio of metals or adding third elements, one can tune the electronic properties and surface chemistry of the catalyst to favor specific reaction pathways.
2. **Tailoring Particle Size and Shape**: Nanoparticle morphology significantly impacts the reactivity and selectivity. Smaller particles can offer more active sites per unit mass, while the shape can affect the surface area and orientation of reactive sites.
3. **Surface Modification**: Coating catalysts with thin layers of noble metals or incorporating ligands can alter the surface properties, enhancing the adsorption of reactants and products.
4. **Reaction Conditions Optimization**: Fine-tuning temperature, pressure, and solvent choice can maximize the desired reaction rates and product yields.
5. **Incorporating Supports**: Using appropriate supports can stabilize the catalyst, improve its mechanical properties, and modulate the reaction environment.

These approaches require a multidisciplinary approach, integrating knowledge from materials science, catalysis, chemical engineering, and computational chemistry. By continuously refining these strategies, scientists aim to develop more efficient and sustainable catalysts for a wide range of industrial applications.

1. The model assumes the existence of three types of active sites - Z-, X-, and Y-type, to understand the behavior of catalytic systems involving multiple types of active sites. These sites differ in their adsorption ability, mode of action, and contribution to reaction routes.

2. The Z-type sites consist of single Pt centers that facilitate dehydrogenation. X-type sites are catalytic clusters of Pt atoms in proper configuration, responsible for cracking. Y-type sites are centers on the interfaces Pt/carrier or Pt/promoter, characterized by weaker adsorption strength.

3. In the case of a pure Pt catalyst (cat_1), dehydrogenation and cracking occur on the same active sites, indicated by identical coefficients in the equations for rates of reactions.

4. Promoters like In or Sn accelerate the dehydrogenation rate and increase selectivity. This is evidenced by the selectivity-conversion curves of cat_2 and cat_3, showing parallel dehydrogenation and cracking reactions.

5. The reaction scheme outlines key steps in the catalytic process, including adsorption, cracking, dehydrogenation, and formation of coke precursors.

6. The limiting step for dehydrogenation involves the removal of the first hydrogen atom, leading to quick transformations of intermediates.

7. Steps 1 and 3 in the reaction scheme control the rate of dehydrogenation. 

8. When the contribution of Z-sites is significant, their surface concentration exceeds that of Y-sites, potentially hiding the contribution of Y-sites to the catalytic action.

9. Promoters reduce the adsorption affinity of all types of sites, accelerating reactions and increasing selectivity.

10. With promoters, the number of Y-type sites responsible for dehydrogenation increases, potentially leading to parallel dehydrogenation and cracking reactions.

11. Cracking occurs onto Pt atoms engaged in X-sites inside the Pt islands, suggesting that dehydrogenation and cracking might happen on independent sites.

12. The proximity of hydrogen intermediates facilitates surface collisions, breaking the chain of coke formation.

13. The equilibrium between precursors Prec1 and Prec2 allows for the interpretation of the dehydrogenation rate's dependence on coke deposition thresholds in the presence of promoters.
