[1] "Detailed knowledge on the behavior of catalytic systems in which more than one type of active sites participate in the reaction mechanism is a subject of both academic and manufacture interest."
[2] "Promoting of the active phase with catalytically inactive metals such as Re, In, Ir and Sn is applied in view of increasing the catalyst activity, improving the selectivity and prolonging the catalyst lifetime."
[3] "In the presence of promoters, the capacity of Y-type sites for keeping the quasi-stationary condition (13) would be higher."
[4] "The Y-type sites seem to be very active, and for this reason their decrease in number exerts not an apparent influence on the common catalyst activity before reaching a threshold limit c**."
[5] "The suggested explanations will be subject of additional verification and proof. Further light onto the problem would call forth better understanding of the intimate reaction mechanism, what is of primary importance for the optimal process design."
