<p>The study is aimed to gain understanding on the mechanism in which Sn and In promoters influence the catalyst deactivation in the course of isobutane dehydrogenation over alumina-supported Pt catalysts.</p>
<p>It has been widely recognized that more than one type of active sites can be distinguished regarding the performance of supported platinum catalysts used for dehydrogenation and refining reactions.</p>

<p>It is essential to note that in case the active phase is pure Pt (cat_1), the values of the coefficients in the denominators of the equations for r and rcr are identical, k2 = k5, which is an indication that the dehydrogenation and cracking steps occur on the same active sites.</p>
