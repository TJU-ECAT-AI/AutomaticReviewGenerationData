The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, especially using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These processes enable the efficient production of valuable intermediates and fuels. To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, researchers employ a combination of theoretical and experimental methodologies. Theoretical approaches involve computational modeling to predict the behavior of catalysts and reaction mechanisms. Experimentally, researchers synthesize and characterize catalysts, perform catalytic tests under controlled conditions, and analyze reaction products to assess the performance of the catalysts. In the specific context of the document, the authors demonstrate the preparation of a bimetallic SnPt complex in the supercages of NaY zeolite, which enhances the selectivity of hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol compared to the parent Pt/NaY catalyst. The selectivity improvement is attributed to the bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species formed during the catalytic process, which alters the electronic properties of the surface Pt atoms and weakens the hydrogenation ability of Pt to furfural, thus enhancing the selectivity for furfuryl alcohol.

催化氢化C═O键，尤其是使用铂-镍等双金属催化剂，对聚合物工业、精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域具有重要贡献。这些过程能够高效地生产有价值的中间体和燃料。为了研究、优化并提高这一过程的选择性和效率，研究人员采用理论和实验相结合的方法。理论方法涉及计算建模来预测催化剂的行为和反应机制。实验上，研究人员合成和表征催化剂，在受控条件下进行催化测试，并分析反应产物，以评估催化剂性能。在文档的具体背景下，作者展示了在钠Y沸石笼中制备SnPt复合物的方法，该复合物提高了糠醛氢化为糠醇的选择性，与纯铂/钠Y催化剂相比表现出更好的性能。选择性增强归因于形成在催化剂表面的双金属Me3SnPt物种，这改变了表面铂原子的电子性质，减弱了铂对糠醛的氢化能力，从而增强了糠醇的选择性。
