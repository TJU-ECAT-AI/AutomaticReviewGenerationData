[1] "Furfuryl alcohol is an important intermediate for the polymer industry. It is used mainly for the production of furan resin, phenolic resin and furfuryl resin."
[2] "A commercial process is the liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural over CuCr catalyst. However, the toxicity, high energy consumption and moderate activity of this catalyst provide a challenge to develop a new high-efficiency catalyst without chromium."
[3] "Recently, a few works concerning the gaseous phase hydrogenation of furfural over carbon-supported copper, Raney nickel, nickel amorphous alloys, mixed copper-zinc oxides doped with Al, Mn and Fe, and homogeneous complexes of Rh, Ru and Pt have been published, but the selectivity of these catalysts still does not reach commercial requirements."
[4] "Our previous results also indicated that the modified HY zeolite by tetraalkyltin exhibited better size selectivity in the absorption of hydrocarbons, and the surface properties changed."
[5] "It was found that the catalyst showed better performance in comparison with the parent Pt/NaY."
[6] "The difference between the electronegativity of Pt and that of the transitional metal resulted in a strong polarization of the catalyst surface, which was considered to be the reason for the high selectivity."
[7] "Herein, we attempt to alter the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation via formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex in the channel pores of zeolites."
[8] "It was found that the catalyst showed better performance in comparison with the parent Pt/NaY."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic catalysts offer improved selectivity and efficiency compared to single-metal catalysts. In the context of furfural hydrogenation, researchers aim to develop more efficient and selective catalysts to produce furfuryl alcohol. This is crucial for industries involved in the production of furan resins, phenolic resins, and furfuryl resins. The study utilizes surface organometallic chemistry to prepare bimetallic SnPt complexes in zeolite structures, which are capable of selectively hydrogenating furfural to furfuryl alcohol. The bimetallic complexes alter the electronic properties of the surface Pt atoms, leading to enhanced selectivity for furfuryl alcohol formation. This approach addresses the limitations of existing catalysts, such as high energy consumption and moderate activity, by offering a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative. Further research aims to optimize the synthesis conditions and catalytic activity for enhanced performance in industrial applications.
