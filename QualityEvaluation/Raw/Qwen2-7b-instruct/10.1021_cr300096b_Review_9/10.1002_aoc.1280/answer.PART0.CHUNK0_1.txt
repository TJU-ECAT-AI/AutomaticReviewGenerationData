[1] "Furfuryl alcohol is an important intermediate for the polymer industry."
[2] "It is used mainly for the production of furan resin, phenolic resin and furfuryl resin."
[3] "However, the toxicity, high energy consumption and moderate activity of this catalyst provide a challenge to develop a new high-efficiency catalyst without chromium."
[4] "Very recently, Kijenski reported that platinum deposited on supports (SiO2, γ -Al2O3, MgO, TiO2) covered with a transition metal oxide monolayer (TiO2, V2O5, ZrO2) had high selectivity for furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol at temperatures from 423 to 573 K."
[5] "Herein, we attempt to alter the electronic properties of surface Pt atoms to enhance the selectivity of hydrogenation via formation of a bimetallic SnPt complex in the channel pores of zeolites."
[6] "Our previous results also indicated that the modified HY zeolite by tetraalkyltin exhibited better size selectivity in the absorption of hydrocarbons, and the surface properties changed."
[7] "In this study, a well-defined surface SnPt bimetallic complex in NaY zeolite was prepared through surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC)."
[8] "It was found that the catalyst showed better performance in comparison with the parent Pt/NaY."
[9] "The bimetallic Me3SnPt surface species is responsible for the enhancement of the selectivity."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by enabling more efficient and selective transformations. These processes are studied and optimized through methodologies that include theoretical modeling, experimental testing, and detailed characterization of the catalysts and products. The selectivity and efficiency of the hydrogenation process can be enhanced by altering the electronic properties of the catalyst surfaces, such as through the formation of bimetallic complexes. This approach leads to improved selectivity in reactions like the hydrogenation of furfural to furfuryl alcohol, which is a key step in the synthesis of various valuable chemicals. The selectivity is attributed to the specific interactions between the catalyst components and the substrates, which can be influenced by factors like the electronic structure of the catalyst and the presence of modifying agents like organotin complexes. Further research aims to optimize these processes and expand their applicability across different industries.

催化氢化C═O键，特别是使用如Pt-Ni这样的双金属催化剂，对工业和研究应用（如精细化学品合成和木质纤维素生物质转化）具有重要意义。这些过程通过理论建模、实验测试和催化剂及其产物的详细表征等方法进行研究和优化。通过改变催化剂表面的电子性质来增强选择性和效率，例如通过在沸石通道孔中形成双金属复合物。这种策略导致了在如糠醛氢化为糠醇这类反应中的选择性增强。选择性归因于催化剂成分与底物之间的特定相互作用，这些作用受催化剂结构的电子特性以及如有机锡化合物这样的修饰剂的影响。进一步的研究旨在优化这些过程，并将它们应用于不同行业。
