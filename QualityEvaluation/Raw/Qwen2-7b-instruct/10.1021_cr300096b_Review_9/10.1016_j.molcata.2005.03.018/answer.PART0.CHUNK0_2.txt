[1] "The PtSn/CeO2 catalysts showed considerably high catalytic performances for the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 at 363 K. The modification of electronic configuration of Pt and the formation of PtSn alloys determined the nature of the active sites contributing to the increase of catalytic performance for the complete oxidation of ethanol."
[2] "In a comparative way, the results of CO adsorption still qualitatively indicated the change of accessibility of Pt to CO with the increase of tin content."
[3] "The separation of SnO2 phase at high tin loading would cover active Pt sites and impede ethanol chemisorption, resulting in a significant increase in the temperature required for complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2."
[4] "Considering the formation of methane must involve the leakage of C-C bond, so above discrepancy might be caused by the difference of the ability in activating C-C bond."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C=O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes significantly to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These applications benefit from enhanced selectivity and efficiency in the process. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance this process typically involve both theoretical and experimental approaches. Theoretical studies often involve computational chemistry to understand the mechanisms of the reactions and predict optimal conditions. Experimental studies include the synthesis and characterization of catalysts, as well as testing their performance under various conditions. For instance, the modification of electronic configuration of Pt and the formation of PtSn alloys in PtSn/CeO2 catalysts determines the nature of the active sites, leading to increased catalytic performance for the complete oxidation of ethanol. The separate SnO2 phase at high tin loading covers active Pt sites and impedes ethanol chemisorption, increasing the temperature required for complete oxidation. The ability to activate C-C bonds effectively plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic performances.

催化氢化C=O键，特别是使用如Pt-Ni这样的双金属催化剂，对精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转换等各个工业和研究应用具有重大贡献。这些应用从过程中的高选择性和效率中受益。用于研究、优化和增强此过程的方法通常涉及理论和实验两个方面。理论研究往往涉及到计算化学来理解反应机制并预测最佳条件。实验研究包括催化剂的合成和表征，以及在各种条件下测试其性能。例如，PtSn/CeO2催化剂中Pt的电子结构的修改和PtSn合金的形成决定了活性位点的性质，导致了乙醇完全氧化为CO2的催化性能的提高。高锡负载下分离的SnO2相覆盖了活性Pt位点，阻碍了乙醇的化学吸附，从而增加了完全氧化乙醇至CO2所需的温度。有效激活C-C键的能力对于提高催化性能至关重要。
