[1] "The PtSn/CeO2 catalysts showed considerably high catalytic performances for the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 at 363 K. The modification of electronic configuration of Pt and the formation of PtSn alloys determined the nature of the active sites contributing to the increase of catalytic performance for the complete oxidation of ethanol."
[2] "The role of tin is often attributed to the formation of PtSn alloy, which had better catalytic properties than Pt alone, and to the presence of well-dispersed Pt particles stabilized by tin."
[3] "The addition of tin can promote the catalytic performances of Pt/CeO2 for ethanol oxidation."
[4] "Clearly, the addition of tin can promote the catalytic performances of Pt/CeO2 for ethanol oxidation."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. These systems enable the selective and efficient conversion of organic compounds, leading to the production of valuable chemicals and fuels. To study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process, methodologies such as computational chemistry, kinetic modeling, and experimental characterization techniques are employed. The electronic configuration of the metals in the catalyst, the formation of metal alloys, and the dispersion of active sites play crucial roles in enhancing the catalytic activity. The presence of tin in PtSn systems, for instance, facilitates the activation of C-C bonds, allowing for the formation of methane and CO, which are further oxidized to final products. This effective interaction between metals improves the catalytic activity for the hydrogenation of C═O bonds. The optimization of these processes involves understanding the mechanisms of reaction, controlling the catalyst composition, and tailoring the catalyst properties to achieve high selectivity and efficiency.
