[1] "The role of tin is often attributed to the formation of PtSn alloy, which had better catalytic properties than Pt alone [912], and to the presence of well-dispersed Pt particles stabilized by tin [13]."
[2] "Considering the recently reported Pt/CeO2 catalysts, which attracted much attention with quite promising catalytic activities in various reactions [1517], it is expectable that PtSn/CeO2 may be potential catalyst for the complete oxidation of ethanol at lower temperatures."
[3] "For PtSn/CeO2 catalysts, the conversion of ethanol increased initially with the addition of Sn, and approached a maximum at Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 1:1. The complete conversion temperature of ethanol over PtSn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn = 1:1) decreased to at temperature as low as 363 K."
[4] "The PtSn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn = 1:1) gave the highest catalytic performances with the complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 and H2O at 363 K, while higher temperatures were needed for the PtSn/CeO2 (Pt/Sn = 1:2) and Pt/CeO2 catalysts."

1. The formation of a PtSn alloy enhances the catalytic properties of Pt, offering better performance than pure Pt. Well-dispersed Pt particles stabilized by tin also contribute to improved catalytic activity. These characteristics make PtSn alloys suitable for various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion.

2. The Pt/CeO2 catalysts have demonstrated promising catalytic activities in numerous reactions. Therefore, it is anticipated that PtSn/CeO2 catalysts, combining the benefits of Pt and Sn, may exhibit enhanced catalytic properties for the complete oxidation of ethanol at lower temperatures.

3. Adding tin to the PtSn/CeO2 catalysts resulted in an initial increase in the conversion of ethanol. This increase peaked at a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 1:1, leading to a complete conversion of ethanol at a remarkably low temperature of 363 K.

4. The PtSn/CeO2 catalyst with a Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 1:1 showed the highest catalytic performance, achieving complete oxidation of ethanol to CO2 and H2O at 363 K. Higher temperatures were required for catalysts with higher tin loading or pure Pt catalysts.

1. PtSn合金的形成提高了铂的催化性能，提供了比纯铂更好的性能。稳定在锡中的分散良好的铂颗粒也对提高催化活性有所贡献。这些特性使得PtSn合金适合各种工业和研究应用，包括精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化。

2. Pt/CeO2催化剂在多种反应中显示出有前景的催化活性。因此，预期PtSn/CeO2催化剂结合了铂和锡的优点，可能在较低温度下具有增强的催化性能以完全氧化乙醇。

3. 添加锡到PtSn/CeO2催化剂中导致了乙醇转化率的初始增加。这一增加在铂/锡原子比为1:1时达到峰值，使得在363 K的低温度下实现了完全的乙醇转化。

4. Pt/Sn原子比为1:1的PtSn/CeO2催化剂显示出了最高的催化性能，在363 K下实现了完全氧化乙醇至CO2和H2O。更高锡负载或纯铂催化剂需要更高的温度。
