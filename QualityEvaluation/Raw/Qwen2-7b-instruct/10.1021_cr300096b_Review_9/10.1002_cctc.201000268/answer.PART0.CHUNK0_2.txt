1. Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion because it allows for the selective transformation of carbonyl compounds into valuable products. For instance, the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes leads to the production of fine chemicals. In biomass conversion, CO bond hydrogenation is seen as an essential initial step. Acetone and acetaldehyde serve as model compounds for studying hydrogenation processes, enabling the production of 2-propanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, and facilitating chemical heat-pump systems.

2. Bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. By combining fundamental surface-science studies and theoretical calculations, researchers can correlate electronic and catalytic properties to optimize hydrogenation processes. In the study, the goal was to extend the activity of γ-Al2O3-supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts to the low-temperature hydrogenation of carbonyl groups using batch and flow reactors. The DFT analysis provided insights into the correlation between electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability, which is crucial for predicting the performance of bimetallic catalysts.

3. The experimental results showed that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibited significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than monometallic catalysts. The rate of hydrogenation was faster for acetone than for acetaldehyde, even though they were processed under similar conditions. The binding energies of the carbonyl compounds on the catalyst surfaces were found to correlate well with the hydrogenation activity, offering a predictive tool for identifying desirable bimetallic structures and formulations.

4. The methodologies employed in this study included batch and flow reactor experiments, CO chemisorption measurements, FTIR spectroscopy for monitoring reactants and products, and DFT calculations for theoretical predictions. These methods allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogenation processes, including the kinetics, product formation, and the role of catalyst structure in determining activity and selectivity.
