[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis."
[2] "The selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols is of growing interest for the production of fine chemicals."
[3] "More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been considered as an important initial step in catalytic conversion of cellulose biomass."
[4] "In addition to being a useful probe reaction, acetone hydrogenation is also an important reaction that can be used to produce 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone."
[5] "Furthermore, the facile hydrogenation of acetaldehyde and acetone is of interest for use in the ethanol-acetaldehyde- hydrogen and isopropanol-acetone-hydrogen chemical heat-pump systems."
[6] "Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity."
[7] "Similar to the correlation established previously for the hydrogenation of CC bonds, the facile CO bond hydrogenation on CoPt can also be correlated to the weaker binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the bimetallic surface, as determined by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[8] "Analysis of DFT results can provide important correlation between the electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability of many monolayer bimetallic surfaces."
[9] "The binding energy trend taken from Figure4 predicted that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface should show higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001)."
[10] "The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation."
[11] "In conclusion, acetone and acetaldehyde have been used as probe molecules to investigate the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group."

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to various industrial and research applications, including fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. Bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-Ni systems, offer enhanced activity and selectivity due to their unique properties compared to monometallic catalysts. The methodologies employed include theoretical calculations using density functional theory (DFT) to analyze electronic properties, chemical reactivity, and structural stability, as well as experimental studies conducted in batch and flow reactors to optimize the hydrogenation process. The binding energies of the carbonyl compounds on different catalyst surfaces are correlated with their hydrogenation activity, providing insights into predicting the most efficient catalyst structures for CO bond hydrogenation.
