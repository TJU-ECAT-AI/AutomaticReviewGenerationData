[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis."
[2] "In addition to being a useful probe reaction, acetone hydrogenation is also an important reaction that can be used to produce 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone."
[3] "Furthermore, the facile hydrogenation of acetaldehyde and acetone is of interest for use in the ethanol-acetaldehyde- hydrogen and isopropanol-acetone-hydrogen chemical heat-pump systems."
[4] "Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity."
[5] "As summarized in Table1, for the hydrogenation of both acetaldehyde and acetone the rate constants show the similar trend of CoPt>Pt>Co."
[6] "The binding energy trend taken from Figure4 predicted that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface should show higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001)."
[7] "The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation."
[8] "Results from batch and flow reactor studies show that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and that acetaldehyde reacts more slowly than acetone over the same catalyst."
[9] "The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001)."

1. Catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups, including C═O bonds, is a versatile and widely used method in organic synthesis. It can also serve as a valuable probe for studying reactions and producing useful compounds like 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone from acetone. This process is of particular interest for its potential in chemical heat-pump systems based on ethanol-acetaldehyde and isopropanol-acetone.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing cobalt and platinum, offer enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts due to the unique properties arising from the combination of metals.

3. The hydrogenation rate constants for both acetaldehyde and acetone indicate that CoPt catalysts perform better than Pt or Co catalysts individually. This is evident from the data in Table1, where the trend shows CoPt > Pt > Co.

4. According to DFT calculations, the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface is expected to have higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001) surfaces, which aligns with the experimental findings.

5. The superior performance of the CoPt catalysts over monometallic catalysts in hydrogenating C═O bonds suggests that the supported bimetallic structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the theoretical model proposed for the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface configuration.

6. The hydrogenation activity of CoPt catalysts is notably higher than that of corresponding monometallic catalysts, as demonstrated in both batch and flow reactor studies. Additionally, acetone reacts faster than acetaldehyde over the same catalyst.

7. The correlation between the hydrogenation activity and the binding energies of carbonyl compounds, as predicted by DFT calculations, supports the hypothesis that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) surface binds acetone and acetaldehyde less strongly, enhancing the hydrogenation efficiency.

1. 催化氢化羰基团，包括C═O键，是有机合成中非常有用且广泛适用的反应途径。它还可以用作研究反应和从丙酮生产有用的化合物（如2-丙醇和甲基异丁基酮）的有价值的探针。该过程特别适用于基于乙醇-丙酮和异丙醇-丙酮的化学热泵系统。

2. 含有钴和铂的双金属催化剂，由于两种金属结合后产生的独特性质，相对于单一金属催化剂提供了增强的活性和选择性。

3. 对于乙醛和丙酮的氢化速率常数表明，CoPt催化剂比单独的Pt或Co催化剂表现更好。这从表格1的数据中可以看出，趋势显示CoPt > Pt > Co。

4. 根据第一原理计算（DFT），预计Pt-Co-Pt(111)双金属表面的氢化活性高于Pt(111)或Co(0001)表面，这与实验结果一致。

5. CoPt催化剂在氢化C═O键方面的优越性能表明，支持的双金属结构应该是Pt终止的，类似于理论模型中提出的Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面配置。

6. CoPt催化剂的氢化活性明显高于相应的单金属催化剂，在批处理和流体反应器研究中均得到证明。此外，相同催化剂下，丙酮的反应速度比丙酮快。

7. 第一原理计算预测的羰基化合物的吸附能与氢化活性之间的相关性支持这样一个假设：Pt-Co-Pt(111)表面吸附丙酮和丙酮较弱，从而提高氢化效率。
