[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis."
[2] "In addition to being a useful probe reaction, acetone hydrogenation is also an important reaction that can be used to produce 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone."
[3] "Furthermore, the facile hydrogenation of acetaldehyde and acetone is of interest for use in the ethanol-acetaldehyde- hydrogen and isopropanol-acetone-hydrogen chemical heat-pump systems."
[4] "Bimetallic catalysts often show properties that differ distinctly from those of the parent metals, offering the opportunity to obtain novel catalysts with enhanced activity and/or selectivity."
[5] "As summarized in Table1, for the hydrogenation of both acetaldehyde and acetone the rate constants show the similar trend of CoPt>Pt>Co."
[6] "The binding energy trend taken from Figure4 predicted that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface should show higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001)."
[7] "The superior CO hydrogenation activity over the CoPt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, as compared to the Co/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, suggests that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the Pt-Co-Pt subsurface configuration identified in the theoretical calculation."
[8] "Results from batch and flow reactor studies show that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and that acetaldehyde reacts more slowly than acetone over the same catalyst."
[9] "The experimental results correlate well with binding energies from DFT calculations, which predict that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface bimetallic structure should be a better hydrogenation catalyst, as it binds acetone and acetaldehyde more weakly than on Pt(111) or Co(0001)."

1. Catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups, including C═O bonds, is a versatile and widely used method in organic synthesis. It can also serve as a valuable probe for studying reactions and producing useful compounds like 2-propanol and methyl isobutyl ketone from acetone. This process is of particular interest for its potential in chemical heat-pump systems based on ethanol-acetaldehyde and isopropanol-acetone.

2. Bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing cobalt and platinum, offer enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts due to the unique properties arising from the combination of metals.

3. The hydrogenation rate constants for both acetaldehyde and acetone indicate that CoPt catalysts perform better than Pt or Co catalysts individually. This is evident from the data in Table1, where the trend shows CoPt > Pt > Co.

4. According to DFT calculations, the Pt-Co-Pt(111) bimetallic surface is expected to have higher hydrogenation activity than either Pt(111) or Co(0001) surfaces, which aligns with the experimental findings.

5. The superior performance of the CoPt catalysts over monometallic catalysts in hydrogenating C═O bonds suggests that the supported bimetallic structure should be Pt-terminated, similar to the theoretical model proposed for the Pt-Co-Pt(111) subsurface configuration.

6. The hydrogenation activity of CoPt catalysts is notably higher than that of corresponding monometallic catalysts, as demonstrated in both batch and flow reactor studies. Additionally, acetone reacts faster than acetaldehyde over the same catalyst.

7. The correlation between the hydrogenation activity and the binding energies of carbonyl compounds, as predicted by DFT calculations, supports the hypothesis that the Pt-Co-Pt(111) surface binds acetone and acetaldehyde less strongly, enhancing the hydrogenation efficiency.

4. 根据第一原理计算（DFT），预计Pt-Co-Pt(111)双金属表面的氢化活性高于Pt(111)或Co(0001)表面，这与实验结果一致。

5. CoPt催化剂在氢化C═O键方面的优越性能表明，支持的双金属结构应该是Pt终止的，类似于理论模型中提出的Pt-Co-Pt(111)亚表面配置。

6. CoPt催化剂的氢化活性明显高于相应的单金属催化剂，在批处理和流体反应器研究中均得到证明。此外，相同催化剂下，丙酮的反应速度比丙酮快。

7. 第一原理计算预测的羰基化合物的吸附能与氢化活性之间的相关性支持这样一个假设：Pt-Co-Pt(111)表面吸附丙酮和丙酮较弱，从而提高氢化效率。

1. Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion because it allows for the selective transformation of carbonyl compounds into valuable products. For instance, the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes leads to the production of fine chemicals. In biomass conversion, CO bond hydrogenation is seen as an essential initial step. Acetone and acetaldehyde serve as model compounds for studying hydrogenation processes, enabling the production of 2-propanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, and facilitating chemical heat-pump systems.

2. Bimetallic catalysts offer enhanced activity and selectivity compared to their monometallic counterparts. By combining fundamental surface-science studies and theoretical calculations, researchers can correlate electronic and catalytic properties to optimize hydrogenation processes. In the study, the goal was to extend the activity of γ-Al2O3-supported CoPt bimetallic catalysts to the low-temperature hydrogenation of carbonyl groups using batch and flow reactors. The DFT analysis provided insights into the correlation between electronic density of states, chemical reactivity, and structural stability, which is crucial for predicting the performance of bimetallic catalysts.

3. The experimental results showed that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibited significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than monometallic catalysts. The rate of hydrogenation was faster for acetone than for acetaldehyde, even though they were processed under similar conditions. The binding energies of the carbonyl compounds on the catalyst surfaces were found to correlate well with the hydrogenation activity, offering a predictive tool for identifying desirable bimetallic structures and formulations.

4. The methodologies employed in this study included batch and flow reactor experiments, CO chemisorption measurements, FTIR spectroscopy for monitoring reactants and products, and DFT calculations for theoretical predictions. These methods allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the hydrogenation processes, including the kinetics, product formation, and the role of catalyst structure in determining activity and selectivity.
