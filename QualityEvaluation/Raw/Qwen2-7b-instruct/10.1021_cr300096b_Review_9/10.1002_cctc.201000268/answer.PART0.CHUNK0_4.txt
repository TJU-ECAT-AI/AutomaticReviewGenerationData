[1] "The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is one of the most useful and widely applicable reaction routes for organic synthesis."
[2] "The hydrogenation activity of acetone over the CoPt bimetallic and Co and Pt monometallic catalysts in batch reactor studies is compared in Figure1."
[3] "Similar to the correlation established previously for the hydrogenation of CC bonds, the facile CO bond hydrogenation on CoPt can also be correlated to the weaker binding energies of acetone and acetaldehyde on the bimetallic surface, as determined by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations."
[4] "In conclusion, acetone and acetaldehyde have been used as probe molecules to investigate the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group. Results from batch and flow reactor studies show that the CoPt bimetallic catalyst exhibits significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity than the corresponding monometallic catalysts, and that acetaldehyde reacts more slowly than acetone over the same catalyst."
[5] "DFT calculations were performed by using periodic density functional theory, as implemented in the Vienna abinitio simulations package (VASP) code."

1. Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. It enables the production of valuable compounds and materials from renewable resources. Bimetallic catalysts, like CoPt systems, are studied and optimized for enhanced selectivity and efficiency through both theoretical methods (like DFT calculations) and experimental approaches (batch and flow reactor studies).

2. The catalytic hydrogenation of carbonyl groups is a versatile method used in organic synthesis, facilitating the conversion of carbonyl compounds into alcohols, alkanes, and other valuable intermediates.

3. DFT calculations are employed to correlate the electronic properties of catalyst surfaces with their catalytic performance. In this context, they predict the binding energies of carbonyl compounds on different surfaces, which in turn correlates with the hydrogenation activity.

4. Bimetallic catalysts like CoPt show higher CO hydrogenation activity than their monometallic counterparts. This is evidenced by both batch and flow reactor studies, indicating improved catalytic performance and selectivity for the hydrogenation of acetone and acetaldehyde.

5. Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations, using software like VASP, are utilized to model the electronic structure of surfaces and predict the binding energies of adsorbates. These calculations provide insights into the catalytic mechanisms and guide the design of efficient catalysts.
