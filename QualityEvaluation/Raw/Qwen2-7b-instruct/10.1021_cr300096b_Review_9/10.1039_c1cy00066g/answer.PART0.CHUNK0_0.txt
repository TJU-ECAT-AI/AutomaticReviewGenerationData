1. Catalytic hydrogenation of the CO bond plays a crucial role in organic synthesis industries. The hydrogenation of propanal, potentially resulting from the hydrogenation of acrolein, offers insights into selectively hydrogenating the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. More recently, CO bond hydrogenation has been recognized as a pivotal initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass. Understanding the connection between catalyst formulation and its properties in propanal hydrogenation aids in selecting catalysts for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and the conversion of cellulose.

2. The investigation of predicting desirable bimetallic catalysts through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and surface science experiments has utilized the hydrogenation of propanal as a model reaction. DFT calculations aimed to forecast the weaker binding energies of propanal on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure. TPD studies on Ni-modified polycrystalline Pt foil confirmed that the subsurface PtNiPt structure displayed higher CO bond hydrogenation activity compared to the surface NiPtPt structure and monometallic Ni and Pt surfaces. The bridging of the materials and pressure gaps between fundamental surface science research and practical catalysis was achieved by evaluating γ-Al2O3-supported NiPt bimetallic catalysts with Ni/Pt molar ratios of 3:1 and 10:1 in batch and flow reactors. The enhanced hydrogenation activity observed with NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts indicates that the supported bimetallic nanoparticle structure might resemble the Pt-terminated configurations identified in theoretical models and surface science studies.

2. 使用丙酮酸氢化作为模型反应，通过密度泛函理论（DFT）计算和表面科学实验来预测理想的双金属催化剂的可能性已经进行了研究。DFT计算旨在预测丙酮酸在亚表面PtNiPt(111)结构上的较弱结合能。Ni改性的多晶Pt箔的TPD结果验证了亚表面PtNiPt结构比表面NiPtPt结构和单金属Ni及Pt表面显示出了更高的CO键氢化活性。通过在批式和流式反应器中评估γ-Al2O3支持的NiPt双金属催化剂（Ni/Pt摩尔比分别为3:1和10:1），实现了材料和压力间隙从基础表面科学研究到实际催化作用的跨越。NiPt/γ-Al2O3催化剂表现出的增强氢化活性表明，支持的双金属纳米颗粒结构可能类似于理论计算和表面科学中识别的终止于Pt的配置。
