1. Catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the selective hydrogenation of CO bonds in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which is crucial for producing desired chemical compounds. In the context of cellulosic biomass conversion, CO bond hydrogenation is recognized as an essential preliminary step. Methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process include theoretical calculations, surface science experiments, and catalytic evaluations using both batch and flow reactors.

2. The catalytic hydrogenation of propanal, specifically through the use of transition metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), and nickel-molybdenum (NiMo), facilitates the production of 1-propanol. This process is also relevant to the selective hydrogenation of the CO bond in α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, which can be achieved through the hydrogenation of acrolein. Moreover, the hydrogenation of propanal serves as a potential initial step in the catalytic conversion of cellulosic biomass, highlighting its importance in the field of renewable energy and biotechnology.

3. Gas phase hydrogenation of propanal is studied using batch reactor techniques with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to quantify the rate constants for hydrogenation. Flow reactor studies employing gas chromatography (GC) are utilized to determine the steady-state conversion and activation barriers. These methodologies enable a comprehensive assessment of the catalytic performance of the bimetallic catalysts.

4. Bimetallic catalysts, notably those containing nickel (Ni) and platinum (Pt), have been found to exhibit significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity compared to their monometallic counterparts. The enhanced activity of these catalysts suggests that they may adopt a Pt-terminated configuration, which is more closely aligned with the subsurface structure identified in theoretical calculations and surface science experiments. This finding implies that the nanoparticle structure of the NiPt catalysts might closely resemble the Pt-terminated subsurface configuration, offering insights into the enhanced catalytic efficiency of bimetallic systems.
