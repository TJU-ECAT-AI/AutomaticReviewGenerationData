How does the catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contribute to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion, and what methodologies are employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process across theoretical and experimental domains?

The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds using bimetallic catalysts, specifically Pt-Ni systems, plays a crucial role in various industrial and research applications. These applications include fine chemical synthesis and the conversion of cellulosic biomass. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process encompass theoretical approaches such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict the binding energies of the reactants on different bimetallic surfaces. Experimental methods involve fundamental surface science studies using techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) to verify the activity of the catalysts. Additionally, practical catalytic evaluation is conducted through batch and flow reactor studies to assess the performance of supported catalysts under real-world conditions. The integration of these theoretical and experimental approaches allows for a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic properties of bimetallic catalysts and facilitates the rational design of catalysts with enhanced hydrogenation activity.

The bimetallic catalysts often exhibit distinct electronic and chemical properties that differ from their parent metals, which can lead to improved catalytic performance. In the context of this research, the main objectives are to explore if a NiPt bimetallic catalyst can enhance the activity for CO bond hydrogenation and to confirm the predictions made by DFT calculations and surface science experiments in supported catalysts. The results indicate that NiPt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts display significantly higher CO hydrogenation activity compared to monometallic catalysts, supporting the feasibility of designing efficient hydrogenation bimetallic catalysts.

This study establishes a direct connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts, demonstrating that the insights gained from theoretical predictions and surface science can be effectively translated into practical applications. The findings suggest that the rational design of bimetallic catalysts for CO bond hydrogenation can be achieved through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental validation, offering a promising and efficient approach to enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this industrially relevant reaction.
