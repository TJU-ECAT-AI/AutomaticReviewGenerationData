The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the efficient production of valuable chemicals like succinic anhydride (SA), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), tetrahydrofurane (THF), and 1,4 butanediol (BDO) from maleic anhydride (MA). These products serve as essential starting materials for the manufacturing of polymers, pharmaceutical compounds, and additives. The use of bimetallic catalysts, especially those containing platinum and nickel, demonstrates enhanced hydrogenation activities compared to monometallic catalysts, leading to higher yields and selectivities. This is due to the distinct properties of bimetallic catalysts, which can improve the reaction selectivity and stability towards the desired products. Researchers employ a variety of methods, including X-ray diffraction (XRD) and hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), to study, optimize, and enhance the efficiency of the hydrogenation process. Through systematic studies involving factors such as reaction temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading, researchers aim to achieve the highest reaction rates with high selectivity to SA, as demonstrated in the case of the PtNi bimetallic catalyst, which showed the highest activity and selectivity among the tested catalysts. The findings suggest that the addition of a small amount of platinum to nickel catalysts can further improve their activity and selectivity, making them more effective for industrial applications.
