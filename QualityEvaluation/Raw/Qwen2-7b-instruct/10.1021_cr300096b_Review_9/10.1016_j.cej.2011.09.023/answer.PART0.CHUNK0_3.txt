[1] "The reaction network for maleic anhydride (MA) hydrogenation is shown in Fig. 1 [1]."
[2] "Some of the reaction products, succinic anhydride (SA), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), tetrahydrofurane (THF), and 1,4 butanediol (BDO), are important starting materials in chemical industry in order to obtain polymers, pharmaceutical compounds and additives."
[3] "It is well known that bimetallic catalysts often show properties that are distinctly different from those of the corresponding monometallic catalysts [17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] , including the enhancement of hydrogenation activities."
[4] "Over the most active catalyst, systematic studies of the reaction system including the influence of reaction temperature and reaction pressure were carried out."
[5] "Moreover, metal loading and reaction pressure have been investigated."
[6] "Furthermore, XRD and H2-TPR were used to characterize the bimetallic catalysts and to determine the possible origin of the enhanced hydrogenation activities of the bimetallic catalysts."
[7] "Results in Fig. 4 show that while activity of these NiPt/Al2O3 catalysts for the hydrogenation of MA, measured as conversion, increases when increasing Pt content, the SA selectivity to reduce the MA decreases for Pt contents over 0.3."
[8] "In our experiment, we have also checked that the full conversion of maleic anhydride could be achieved over 5% Ni/Al2O3 at the reaction temperature of 220 C."
[9] "In agreement with the results shown here, previous studies have reported that the rapid deactivation was initially attributed to carbonaceous compounds deposited on the metal surface [1]."
[10] "The results obtained with PtNi have been compared with those reported in the literature using Rh and Pd catalysts."
[11] "There is an interesting report on the hydrogenation of maleic anhydride in supercritical CO2 medium in place of toxic and hazardous organic solvents."

1. The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion by providing more efficient and selective routes to produce valuable chemicals. Bimetallic catalysts offer higher hydrogenation activities than their monometallic counterparts, enhancing the yield of desired products like succinic anhydride (SA) from maleic anhydride (MA).

2. The methodologies employed to study, optimize, and enhance the selectivity and efficiency of this process involve a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches. Theoretical studies might involve computational simulations to understand the electronic interactions and reaction pathways on the catalyst surface. Experimentally, researchers use techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD) and H2 temperature programmed reduction (TPR) to characterize the catalysts, and gas chromatography (GC) or GCMS to analyze the products. Systematic studies of the reaction system, including the influence of reaction temperature, pressure, and metal loading, are carried out to optimize the process conditions.

3. The process of hydrogenation of MA is controlled by the dissociation of hydrogen on the surface of nickel (Ni) atoms. Adding a small amount of platinum (Pt) to Ni catalysts can further improve the rate of hydrogen dissociation, thereby enhancing the overall catalytic activity without sacrificing the selectivity towards SA.

4. Bimetallic catalysts like PtNi have been shown to exhibit higher hydrogenation activities than monometallic catalysts, indicating distinct properties and enhanced selectivity for the hydrogenation of MA. These catalysts are crucial for industrial applications due to their ability to produce important chemical intermediates like SA with high yields and selectivities.

5. The process of hydrogenation in supercritical CO2 medium offers an alternative approach to traditional solvent-based methods, potentially leading to greener and more sustainable industrial processes. The PtNi catalysts, when compared to other metals like rhodium (Rh) and palladium (Pd), demonstrate higher activity in hydrogenating MA, suggesting that platinum alone can be an effective catalyst for producing SA without the need for consecutive hydrogenations.

1. 镍钯双金属催化剂在CO键氢化反应中的应用，特别是在MA氢化中使用Pt-Ni系统，对于精细化学品合成和木质素生物质转化等领域具有重要意义。双金属催化剂通常展现出与单一金属催化剂截然不同的特性，包括增强的氢化活性，这为制备有价值的化学品如琥珀酸酐（SA）提供了更高效、选择性更高的途径。

2. 研究、优化和提高此过程的选择性和效率的方法涉及理论和实验相结合。理论上，可能通过计算模拟来理解催化剂表面的电子相互作用和反应路径。实验上，研究人员使用X射线衍射(XRD)和H2温度程序还原(TPR)等技术来表征催化剂，以及气相色谱(GC)或GC-MS分析产物。对反应系统的系统研究，包括反应温度、压力和金属负载的影响，用于优化工艺条件。

3. MA氢化过程受镍（Ni）原子表面氢解离控制。向Ni催化剂中添加少量铂（Pt）可以进一步提高氢解离速率，从而增强整体催化活性，同时不牺牲SA选择性。

4. PtNi双金属催化剂已显示出比单一金属催化剂更高的氢化活性，表明它们在MA氢化方面具有独特的性质和增强的选择性。这些催化剂对于工业应用至关重要，因为它们能够以高产率和选择性生产重要化学中间体如SA。

5. 在超临界CO2介质中的氢化过程提供了一种替代传统的溶剂基方法的途径，可能导致更环保、更可持续的工业流程。与铑(Rh)、钯(Pd)等其他金属相比，PtNi催化剂在氢化MA时表现出更高的活性，表明仅使用铂就足以作为生产SA的有效催化剂，无需进行连续氢化。
