The catalytic hydrogenation of C═O bonds, particularly using bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni systems, contributes to various industrial and research applications such as fine chemical synthesis and cellulosic biomass conversion. This process allows for the production of valuable intermediates and products like succinic anhydride (SA), γ-butyrolactone (GBL), tetrahydrofurane (THF), and 1,4 butanediol (BDO), which are essential in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industries. The methodology involves studying the reaction network, focusing on the involvement of hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions, and the formation of products like SA and GBL. The optimization of parameters such as reaction temperature, pressure, and catalyst loading is crucial for enhancing the selectivity and efficiency of the process. Bimetallic catalysts like Pt-Ni are particularly effective, showing the highest activity and selectivity for MA hydrogenation, mainly due to the formation of a PtNi compound. A small amount of Pt can further improve the activity and selectivity of Ni-based catalysts. The process is controlled by H2 dissociation on nickel and can be improved without sacrificing selectivity by adding a small amount of Pt. The hydrogenation activities of bimetallic catalysts are higher than those of their monometallic counterparts, indicating the potential for significant advancements in the field of catalytic hydrogenation.
