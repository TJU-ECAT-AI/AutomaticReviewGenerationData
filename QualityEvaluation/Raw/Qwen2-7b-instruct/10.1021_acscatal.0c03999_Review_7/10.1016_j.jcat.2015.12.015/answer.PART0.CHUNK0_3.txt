The presence of tungsten oxide (WOx) in the catalyst plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation of propane. It affects the reducibility and dispersion of vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene. The reducibility of VOx species is influenced by the amount of WOx present, as shown in the inset of Figure 2. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was employed to study the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species on the silica support. The reaction orders for propane (C3H8) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were determined by plotting the logarithm of the average turnover frequency (TOF) against the logarithm of the inlet molar flow rate of the respective compounds.

钨氧化物（WOx）在催化剂中的存在对丙烷的脱氢作用起着关键作用。它影响了钒氧化物（VOx）物种的可还原性和分散性，从而提高了催化活性和丙烯选择性。WOx含量的多少会影响VOx物种的可还原性，如图2插入所示。通过氢温程法（H2-TPR）研究了二氧化硅支持上的范德华表面物种的可还原性。通过将化合物的进料摩尔流率的对数与平均转化频率（TOF）的对数作图，确定了丙烷（C3H8）和二氧化碳（CO2）的反应级数。

The catalyst with a W/V molar ratio of 0.1 has the highest average turnover frequency for C3H6, but higher selectivities are achieved with a W/V molar ratio of 0.6. The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness method. The investigated catalysts contain approximately 3.5% weight of vanadium and are denoted based on their weight percentage of tungsten as 0WV (0%), 1.5WV (1.5%), 4.5WV (4.5%), and 6.8WV (6.8%).

与W/V摩尔比为0.6相比，W/V摩尔比为0.1的催化剂对于C3H6具有最高的平均转化频率，但更高的选择性是在W/V摩尔比为0.6时获得的。催化剂是通过初始湿法法制备的。研究的催化剂含有大约3.5%的重量的钒，并基于其钨的重量百分比表示为0WV（0%），1.5WV（1.5%），4.5WV（4.5%）和6.8WV（6.8%）。

[1] "The amount of hydrogen at any time during the reaction was higher than the propylene yield for the VOx unpromoted catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
During the reaction, the amount of hydrogen produced was always greater than the propylene yield for the VOx-unpromoted catalyst. This clearly demonstrates that less than half of the exchangeable oxygen is regenerated by CO2, which is attributed to the oxidation of V2O3 into V2O4 rather than V2O5. After the catalytic experiments, the carbon deposits were burned off from the catalysts.

在反应过程中，产生的氢气量总是大于未促进的VOx催化剂的丙烯产量。这清楚地表明，CO2再生的氧少于一半，这是归因于V2O3氧化为V2O4而不是V2O5。在催化实验后，从催化剂上烧去了碳沉积物。
