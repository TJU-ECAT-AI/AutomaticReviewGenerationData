[1] "When using chromium or vanadium oxide based catalysts, CO2 can re-oxidize partially reduced metal oxides."
[2] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state."
[3] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[4] "Based on the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane,while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is occurring on a smaller timescale."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. The reducibility of Fe oxide affects its ability to undergo redox cycling, which is crucial for CO2-ODHP. The support material, particularly activated carbon (AC), plays a role in maintaining the dispersion of Fe oxide particles and facilitating the redox process. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe oxide species are reduced and then re-oxidized, leading to the activation of propane molecules and the formation of propylene. The CO2-ODHP process is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, as calculated by DFT at 600°C. The re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a smaller timescale compared to the activation of propane, influencing the overall efficiency of the process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。Fe氧化物的可还原性影响其进行氧化还原循环的能力，这对于CO2-ODHP至关重要。支持材料，特别是活性炭（AC），在保持Fe氧化物颗粒的分散性和促进氧化还原过程方面发挥作用。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe氧化物物种被还原并随后重新氧化，导致丙烷分子的激活和丙烯的形成。CO2-ODHP过程受丙烷中二级CAH键的活化限制，在600°C时通过DFT计算得出。催化剂用CO2重新氧化的速率较慢，与丙烷的活化相比，影响整个过程的效率。
