The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the Fe oxide surface species and the characteristics of the support material. Specifically, the presence of a support material such as activated carbon (AC) can enhance the reducibility of the Fe oxide, allowing for a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. This is evidenced by the statement: "Catalysts characterization using temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),temperature programmed oxidation (CO2-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy shows that the combination of the two metal components allows retention of VOx dispersion during the reaction." The reducibility of the Fe oxide is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as stated: "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene." 

In CO2-ODHP, the presence of D2 in the feed with propane and CO2 leads to only 45% of the resulting water containing D2O, suggesting that the reaction involves both oxidative dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) processes, as stated: "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O." This indicates that CO2 plays a role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon, as stated: "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon." 

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a partially reduced vanadia dimer as the active site confirmed that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, as stated: "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed. This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio showed the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency, but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6, as stated: "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6." This suggests that the optimal ratio of tungsten to vanadium can affect the efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation process.

The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is rate-limiting in the presence of CO2, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale, as stated: "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster." This highlights the importance of the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the role of CO2 in controlling the reaction kinetics and product distribution.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的表现受到铁氧化物表面物种可还原性及支持材料特性的显著影响。具体而言，活性碳（AC）等支持材料的存在可以增强铁氧化物的可还原性，从而更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。这一点可以从以下表述中看出：“催化剂的表征使用温度程序还原（H2-TPR）、温度程序氧化（CO2-TPO）、拉曼光谱、X射线衍射和透射电子显微镜显示，两种金属成分的组合允许在反应过程中保持VOx的分散。”铁氧化物的可还原性对于丙烷的氧化脱氢至关重要，因为二氧化碳具有将V2O3氧化为V2O4的能力，并且参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢过程，如上所述：“二氧化碳具有将V2O3氧化为V2O4的能力，并参与丙烷的氧化脱氢以生成丙烯。”

在CO2-ODHP中，向丙烷和二氧化碳中加入氘（D2）导致只有45%的生成水含有D2O，这表明反应涉及氧化脱氢和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）过程，如上所述：“当反应在D2与C3H8和CO2（D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1）共存的情况下进行时，只有45%的生成水中含有D2O。”这表明二氧化碳在抑制表面碳形成方面起着重要作用，正如上述：“此外，二氧化碳的一个主要作用是抑制表面碳的形成。”

使用部分还原的钒二聚体作为活性位点并进行密度泛函理论（DFT）计算证实，在二氧化碳存在下，丙烷脱氢可以同时通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后由逆水煤气变换反应实现，如上所述：“使用部分还原的钒二聚体作为活性位点并进行了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。这使得确认在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢可以同时通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后由逆水煤气变换反应实现。”

钨/钒比例为0.1 M的催化剂显示出最高的C3H6平均转速频率，但更高选择性是在钨/钒比例为0.6的情况下获得的，正如上文所述：“钨/钒比例为0.1 M的催化剂显示出最高的C3H6平均转速频率，但更高选择性是在钨/钒比例为0.6的情况下获得的。”这意味着催化剂中钨和钒的比例可能会影响脱氢过程的效率和选择性。

在二氧化碳存在下，丙烷的次级CAH键的活化是限制性步骤，而催化剂用二氧化碳重新氧化则发生在更快的时间尺度上，如上所述：“根据在600°C时由DFT计算得到的吉布斯自由能图谱，丙烷的次级CAH键活化（EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol）是限制性步骤，而催化剂用二氧化碳重新氧化可能发生在更快的时间尺度上。”这突出了铁氧化物的氧化还原循环及其在控制反应动力学和产品分布方面的作用。
