The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support materials, particularly activated carbon (AC). Fe oxide's reducibility determines its ability to undergo redox reactions, which are crucial for the activation of propane molecules and the formation of propylene. Activated carbon provides a large surface area for Fe oxide deposition and supports the distribution of Fe oxide species, enhancing catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) ions are reduced to Fe(II) ions during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and subsequently oxidized back to Fe(III) ions with the assistance of CO2. This cycle facilitates the activation of the propane molecule and the formation of propylene, making Fe oxide-based catalysts efficient for CO2-ODHP.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到铁氧化物可还原性和支撑材料，特别是活性炭（AC）的影响。铁氧化物的可还原性决定了其进行氧化还原反应的能力，这是激活丙烷分子和形成丙烯的关键。活性炭提供了大量的表面积，用于铁氧化物的沉积，并支持铁氧化物物种的分布，从而增强催化活性。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，在此过程中，铁(III)离子被还原为铁(II)离子，随后在二氧化碳的帮助下重新氧化回铁(III)离子。这一循环促进了丙烷分子的激活和丙烯的形成，使铁氧化物基催化剂成为高效的CO2-ODHP催化剂。
