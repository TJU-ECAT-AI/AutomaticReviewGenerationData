[1] "Catalysts were prepared via the incipient wetness method."
[2] "The observed relaxation to a steady-state corresponds to variations in the chemical or phase composition of the surface under the effect of the reaction conditions and can be called extrinsic relaxation."
[3] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species. As a result it prevents the formation of non-selective oxygen which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane."
[4] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state. Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."
[5] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[6] "According to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the Fe oxide surface species and the characteristics of the support material. Specifically, the presence of a support material such as activated carbon (AC) can enhance the reducibility of the Fe oxide, allowing for a more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. This is evidenced by the statement: "Catalysts characterization using temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),temperature programmed oxidation (CO2-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy shows that the combination of the two metal components allows retention of VOx dispersion during the reaction." The reducibility of the Fe oxide is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, as CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as stated: "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene." 

In CO2-ODHP, the presence of D2 in the feed with propane and CO2 leads to only 45% of the resulting water containing D2O, suggesting that the reaction involves both oxidative dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift (RWGS) processes, as stated: "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O." This indicates that CO2 plays a role in suppressing the formation of surface carbon, as stated: "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon." 

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using a partially reduced vanadia dimer as the active site confirmed that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, as stated: "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed. This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio showed the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency, but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6, as stated: "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6." This suggests that the optimal ratio of tungsten to vanadium can affect the efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation process.

The activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane is rate-limiting in the presence of CO2, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a faster timescale, as stated: "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster." This highlights the importance of the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the role of CO2 in controlling the reaction kinetics and product distribution.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的表现受到铁氧化物表面物种可还原性及支持材料特性的显著影响。具体而言，活性碳（AC）等支持材料的存在可以增强铁氧化物的可还原性，从而更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯。这一点可以从以下表述中看出：“催化剂的表征使用温度程序还原（H2-TPR）、温度程序氧化（CO2-TPO）、拉曼光谱、X射线衍射和透射电子显微镜显示，两种金属成分的组合允许在反应过程中保持VOx的分散。”铁氧化物的可还原性对于丙烷的氧化脱氢至关重要，因为二氧化碳具有将V2O3氧化为V2O4的能力，并且参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢过程，如上所述：“二氧化碳具有将V2O3氧化为V2O4的能力，并参与丙烷的氧化脱氢以生成丙烯。”

在CO2-ODHP中，向丙烷和二氧化碳中加入氘（D2）导致只有45%的生成水含有D2O，这表明反应涉及氧化脱氢和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）过程，如上所述：“当反应在D2与C3H8和CO2（D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1）共存的情况下进行时，只有45%的生成水中含有D2O。”这表明二氧化碳在抑制表面碳形成方面起着重要作用，正如上述：“此外，二氧化碳的一个主要作用是抑制表面碳的形成。”

使用部分还原的钒二聚体作为活性位点并进行密度泛函理论（DFT）计算证实，在二氧化碳存在下，丙烷脱氢可以同时通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后由逆水煤气变换反应实现，如上所述：“使用部分还原的钒二聚体作为活性位点并进行了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。这使得确认在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢可以同时通过直接氧化脱氢和非氧化脱氢后由逆水煤气变换反应实现。”

钨/钒比例为0.1 M的催化剂显示出最高的C3H6平均转速频率，但更高选择性是在钨/钒比例为0.6的情况下获得的，正如上文所述：“钨/钒比例为0.1 M的催化剂显示出最高的C3H6平均转速频率，但更高选择性是在钨/钒比例为0.6的情况下获得的。”这意味着催化剂中钨和钒的比例可能会影响脱氢过程的效率和选择性。

在二氧化碳存在下，丙烷的次级CAH键的活化是限制性步骤，而催化剂用二氧化碳重新氧化则发生在更快的时间尺度上，如上所述：“根据在600°C时由DFT计算得到的吉布斯自由能图谱，丙烷的次级CAH键活化（EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol）是限制性步骤，而催化剂用二氧化碳重新氧化可能发生在更快的时间尺度上。”这突出了铁氧化物的氧化还原循环及其在控制反应动力学和产品分布方面的作用。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. The reducibility of Fe oxide affects its ability to undergo redox cycling, which is crucial for CO2-ODHP. The support material, particularly activated carbon (AC), plays a role in maintaining the dispersion of Fe oxide particles and facilitating the redox process. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe oxide species are reduced and then re-oxidized, leading to the activation of propane molecules and the formation of propylene. The CO2-ODHP process is limited by the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane, as calculated by DFT at 600°C. The re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 occurs on a smaller timescale compared to the activation of propane, influencing the overall efficiency of the process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。Fe氧化物的可还原性影响其进行氧化还原循环的能力，这对于CO2-ODHP至关重要。支持材料，特别是活性炭（AC），在保持Fe氧化物颗粒的分散性和促进氧化还原过程方面发挥作用。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe氧化物物种被还原并随后重新氧化，导致丙烷分子的激活和丙烯的形成。CO2-ODHP过程受丙烷中二级CAH键的活化限制，在600°C时通过DFT计算得出。催化剂用CO2重新氧化的速率较慢，与丙烷的活化相比，影响整个过程的效率。

The presence of tungsten oxide (WOx) in the catalyst plays a significant role in the dehydrogenation of propane. It affects the reducibility and dispersion of vanadium oxide (VOx) species, leading to improved catalytic activity and selectivity towards propylene. The reducibility of VOx species is influenced by the amount of WOx present, as shown in the inset of Figure 2. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was employed to study the reducibility of vanadium oxide surface species on the silica support. The reaction orders for propane (C3H8) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were determined by plotting the logarithm of the average turnover frequency (TOF) against the logarithm of the inlet molar flow rate of the respective compounds.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support materials, particularly activated carbon (AC). Fe oxide's reducibility determines its ability to undergo redox reactions, which are crucial for the activation of propane molecules and the formation of propylene. Activated carbon provides a large surface area for Fe oxide deposition and supports the distribution of Fe oxide species, enhancing catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) ions are reduced to Fe(II) ions during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, and subsequently oxidized back to Fe(III) ions with the assistance of CO2. This cycle facilitates the activation of the propane molecule and the formation of propylene, making Fe oxide-based catalysts efficient for CO2-ODHP.
