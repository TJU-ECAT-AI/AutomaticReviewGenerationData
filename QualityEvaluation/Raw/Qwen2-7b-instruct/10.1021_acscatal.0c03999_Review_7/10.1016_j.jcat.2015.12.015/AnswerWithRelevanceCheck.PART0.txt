          [1] "Catalysts were prepared via the incipient wetness method."
          [2] "The observed relaxation to a steady-state corresponds to variations in the chemical or phase composition of the surface under the effect of the reaction conditions and can be called extrinsic relaxation."
          [3] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene."
          [4] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state."
          [5] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
          [6] "According to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

          The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness method. The relaxation to a steady-state reflects changes in the chemical or phase composition of the catalyst surface due to reaction conditions, known as extrinsic relaxation. The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) significantly impacts the catalyst and the propane-to-propylene conversion reaction. Carbon dioxide (CO2), as the oxidant, only oxidizes to V2O4 and cannot fully restore the catalyst to its original V2O5 state. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation increases propylene production selectivity and reduces carbon formation. Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, as supported by isotopic experiments and DFT calculations.

          催化剂是通过初始湿润法制备的。转至稳定状态反映出催化剂表面化学或相组成因反应条件变化而发生的变化，这被称为外在松弛。钨氧化物（WOx）的存在明显影响催化剂本身以及丙烷转化为丙烯的反应。二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂，仅氧化至V2O4，无法完全恢复催化剂至原始的V2O5状态。二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢作用提高了丙烯产率的选择性并减少了碳的形成。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢作用可以通过直接氧化脱氢作用和非氧化脱氢作用后继以逆水煤气变换反应同时进行，这一过程得到了同位素实验和DFT计算的支持。

          [1] "The catalysts characterization using temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR),temperature programmed oxidation (CO2-TPO), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy shows that the combination of the two metal components allows retention of VOx dispersion during the reaction."
          [2] "CO2 has the ability to oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and participates in the oxidative dehydrogenation of pro- pane to propylene."
          [3] "When the reaction is carried out with D2 present in the feed together with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the resulting water contains D2O."
          [4] "Moreover, one of the major roles of CO2 is the suppression of the formation of surface carbon."
          [5] "A partially reduced vana- dia dimer was used to represent the active site and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were per- formed. This allowed to confirm that propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."
          [6] "The catalyst with a W/V = 0.1 M ratio has the highest C3H6 average turnover frequency but higher selectivities were obtained with W/V = 0.6."
          [7] "According to the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600 C, the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, while re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 is potentially much faster."

          The catalyst characterization through H2-TPR, CO2-TPO, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy indicates that the combination of metals enables the retention of VOx dispersion during the reaction. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and is involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. When D2 is present in the feed with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the generated water contains D2O, suggesting simultaneous oxidative dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions. CO2 helps suppress the formation of surface carbon. DFT calculations using a partially reduced vanadia dimer as the active site confirmed that propane dehydrogenation with CO2 can occur concurrently through direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalyst with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M has the highest average C3H6 turnover frequency, but higher selectivities were achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6. At 600°C, the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile shows that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, whereas catalyst re-oxidation with CO2 could occur much faster.

          使用H2-TPR、CO2-TPO、拉曼光谱、X射线衍射和透射电子显微镜对催化剂进行表征显示，两种金属成分的组合可以在反应期间保留VOx的分散。二氧化碳可以将V2O3氧化为V2O4，并参与丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢作用。当在丙烷、二氧化碳（D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1）的混合物中加入D2时，生成水中只有45%含有D2O，这表明存在同时的氧化脱氢作用和逆水煤气变换反应。二氧化碳有助于抑制表面碳的形成。使用部分还原的钒二聚体作为活性位点的DFT计算确认了在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢作用可以通过直接氧化脱氢作用和非氧化脱氢作用后继以逆水煤气变换反应同时进行。钨/钒比例为0.1 M的催化剂显示出最高的平均C3H6转速频率，但更高选择性是在钨/钒比例为0.6的情况下获得的。在600°C时，由DFT计算得到的吉布斯自由能图谱表明，丙烷中二级CAH键的活化（EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol）是限制性步骤，而催化剂用二氧化碳重新氧化则可能发生在更快的时间尺度上。

          Vanadium oxide is recognized as a key component in metal oxide catalysis. Enhancements in yield can be achieved by incorporating WOx. The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over WOxVOx/SiO2 involves oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4 and participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. CO2 also helps in suppressing the formation of surface carbon. A partially reduced vanadia dimer was utilized as the active site for DFT calculations. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600°C reveals that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) acts as a rate-limiting step, whereas the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 could occur much faster.
