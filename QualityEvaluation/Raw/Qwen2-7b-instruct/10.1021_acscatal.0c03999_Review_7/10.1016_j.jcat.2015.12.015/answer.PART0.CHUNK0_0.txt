[1] "Catalysts were prepared via the incipient wetness method."
[2] "The observed relaxation to a steady-state corresponds to variations in the chemical or phase composition of the surface under the effect of the reaction conditions and can be called extrinsic relaxation."
[3] "The presence of WOx clearly has an impact on the catalyst itself and the conversion reaction of propane to propylene. It hinders the clustering of the VOx species during reaction by acting as a physical barrier between the VOx species. As a result it prevents the formation of non-selective oxygen which reduces the probability of CO2 formation and thus total oxidation of propane."
[4] "CO2 as the oxidant, on the other hand, cannot re-oxidize the catalyst completely to its V2O5 state. Using CO2, it is only possible to oxidize to V2O4, as confirmed by the isothermal reduction experiments of the CO2 re-oxidized sample."
[5] "Furthermore, CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation results in a higher selectivity toward propylene production and a reduction of carbon formation."
[6] "According to isotopic experiments during reaction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can proceed simultaneously via direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction."

1. Catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness method.
2. The relaxation to a steady-state reflects changes in the chemical or phase composition of the catalyst surface due to reaction conditions.
3. The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) inhibits the clustering of vanadium oxide (VOx) species, preventing the formation of non-selective oxygen and reducing CO2 formation and total oxidation of propane.
4. Carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant only oxidizes to vanadium dioxide (V2O4) and cannot fully re-oxidize the catalyst back to its original V2O5 state.
5. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation leads to higher propylene production and reduced carbon formation.
6. DFT calculations and isotopic experiments demonstrate that CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation can proceed through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction.

1. 催化剂是通过初始湿润法制备的。
2. 转变为稳定状态反映了催化剂表面化学或相组成的变化，这是由于反应条件的影响。
3. 钨氧化物（WOx）的存在抑制了二氧化钒（VOx）物种的聚集，阻止了非选择性氧的形成，减少了二氧化碳的生成和丙烷的完全氧化。
4. 二氧化碳（CO2）作为氧化剂只能氧化到二氧化钒（V2O4），无法完全将催化剂还原回原始的V2O5状态。
5. 二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢作用导致更高的丙烯产量和碳形成的减少。
6. DFT计算和同位素实验表明，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，丙烷脱氢作用可以通过直接氧化脱氢作用和非氧化脱氢作用以及随后的逆水煤气转换反应同时进行。
