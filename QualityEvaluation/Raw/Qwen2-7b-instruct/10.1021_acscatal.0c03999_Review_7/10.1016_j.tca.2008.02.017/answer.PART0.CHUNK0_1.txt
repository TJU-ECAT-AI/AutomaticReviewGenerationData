[1] "Many active carbon supported catalysts have been already commercialized (e.g. active carbon supported noble metals for hydrogenation processes) [1]."
[2] "Their catalytic performance was tested in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide [25]."
[3] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[4] "A behavior of the fresh and used samples was tested in a temperature range of 251000 C in different atmospheres (inert gas, air or CO2)."
[5] "It was found that the catalytic runs resulted in a partial decomposition of surface O-containing groups, which together with CrOx species play a role of active centers."
[6] "Moreover, a formation of inactive carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface was observed."
[7] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one. This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) [9,10]; (2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium [1114]; (3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst [11,13]."
[8] "The optimal catalyst composition was determined for the reaction performed at a thermodynamically reasonable temperature of 600 C."
[9] "An increase in the Cr loading results in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the catalytic activity."
[10] "Unfortunately, the active carbon-based catalyst underwent a fast deactivation."
[11] "On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface."
[12] "The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons of the activity loss."

1. Active carbon-supported catalysts have been commercialized for hydrogenation processes, including use in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide.
2. The demand for propene is increasing due to its use in various industries like polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and cumene, driving research for alternative production methods and improved yields from conventional sources.
3. The temperature range for testing the catalytic activity of the samples was 25-1000°C under different atmospheres.
4. The partial decomposition of surface oxygen-containing groups and the formation of inactive carbon deposits on the catalyst surface were observed.
5. The direct oxidation of propane to propene, hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction, and coke gasification are mechanisms through which carbon dioxide promotes the dehydrogenation of propane.
6. The optimal catalyst composition was determined for a reaction at a temperature of 600°C.
7. Increasing chromium loading leads to the formation of the crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, which partially blocks micropores and reduces catalytic activity.
