[1] "Growing demand on propene, driven mainly by increasing demand on polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and cumene, stimulates studies aimed at finding new methods of propene production from alternative sources and an improvement of propene yield from conventional sources."
[2] "Recently, the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has been studied as an alternative technology for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one."
[4] "This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:"
[5] "(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O)"
[6] "(2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium"

[10] "Inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) and carbonaceous materials (diamond, active carbon) were tested as the supports."
[11] "Some of these studies have demonstrated that promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane strongly depends on properties of support."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and the properties of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. The catalytic activity is enhanced by the presence of carbon dioxide, which promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through several mechanisms. These include direct oxidation of propane to propene, hydrogen consumption by the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and coke gasification. The support materials play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity, as their properties can affect the distribution and reactivity of the Fe oxide catalyst. In the context of Fe2O3/AC, the active carbon support provides a large surface area and can stabilize the Fe oxide catalyst, contributing to the overall catalytic performance. The thermal analysis method, specifically through TG (Thermogravimetric Analysis), helps elucidate the reasons behind the deactivation of the catalyst, revealing the importance of both the reduction of active sites due to the formation of inactive coke and the decomposition of surface groups during the reaction process.
