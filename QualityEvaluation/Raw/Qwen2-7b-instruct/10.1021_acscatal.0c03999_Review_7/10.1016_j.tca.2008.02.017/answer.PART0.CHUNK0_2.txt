<p>The CrOx-containing active carbons appeared to be extremely active catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. It was found that the catalytic activity and selectivity strongly depended on the Cr loading. The highest propane conversions were achieved for the sample with the Cr content closed to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the active carbon-based catalyst underwent a fast deactivation.</p>
<p>The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons of the activity loss. TG experiments performed in the flow of inert gas showed that the active carbon support exhibited the presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species which played a role in the catalytic process. A gradual decrease in the surface concentration of these groups was observed after the catalytic run. On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface. This effect was confirmed by TG measurements in the O2-rich atmosphere. Additionally, it was proved that CO2 was practically inert in a relation to the carbonaceous support in the conditions used during the catalytic process.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity. The presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species on the active carbon support contributes to the catalytic process, but their gradual decrease upon the catalytic run indicates a potential mechanism for catalyst deactivation. Inactive coke formation on the catalyst surface further diminishes the activity over time. The study highlights the importance of the interplay between the redox properties of the Fe oxide, the support material characteristics, and the effect of CO2 on the catalytic activity and deactivation pathways.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环对增强催化活性至关重要。活性碳支持上的羰基和羧基类似表面物种对催化过程有贡献，但它们在催化运行后的浓度逐渐减少表明催化剂失活机制的可能性。催化剂表面上形成的无活性焦炭进一步减少了随时间的活动性。研究强调了Fe氧化物的还原性质、支持材料特性和CO2对催化活性和失活途径的重要作用。
