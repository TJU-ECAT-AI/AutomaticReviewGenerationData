[1] "Many active carbon supported catalysts have been already commercialized (e.g. active carbon supported noble metals for hydrogenation processes) [1]."
[2] "Active carbon appeared to be a very promising candidate for a support of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts as well."
[3] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one. This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene (C3H8 + CO2 = C3H6 + CO + H2O) [9,10]; (2) hydrogen consumption by reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2 + H2 = CO + H2O), which shifts propane dehydrogenation equilibrium [11-14]; (3) coke gasification (CO2 + Ccoke = 2CO), which slows down the deactivation rate of catalyst [11,13]."
[4] "In the presented work, we have shown the promoting effect of active carbon support in the catalytic process of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. The real role of this support in the studied reaction has been discussed basing on the results of TG analysis of fresh and used chromium oxide supported on active carbon in inert and oxidizing (the presence of air or CO2) atmospheres."
[5] "Unfortunately, the active carbon-based catalyst underwent a fast deactivation."
[6] "The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons of the activity loss. TG experiments performed in the flow of inert gas showed that the active carbon support exhibited the presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species which played a role in the catalytic process. A gradual decrease in the surface concentration of these groups was observed after the catalytic run. On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface."
[7] "It was found that the catalytic activity and selectivity strongly depended on the Cr loading. The highest propane conversions were achieved for the sample with the Cr content close to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the catalytic activity."
[8] "It was proved that CO2 was practically inert in relation to the carbonaceous support in the conditions used during the catalytic process."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC combinations. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. As per the document, the presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species on the active carbon support contributes to the catalytic process. These groups gradually decrease in concentration after the catalytic run, suggesting their importance in the dehydrogenation reaction. The document also indicates that the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface during the propane dehydrogenation process is another factor contributing to the catalyst's deactivation. The use of active carbon as a support material for Fe oxide catalysts shows promise in CO2-ODHP due to its ability to enhance the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, especially when the Fe content is around 5 wt.%. The effectiveness of CO2 in the catalytic process is limited under the conditions described, indicating its minor role in the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC组合。Fe氧化物的还原循环在催化活性中起着关键作用。根据文档，活性碳支持上存在的羰基和羧基类似表面物种对催化过程有贡献。这些群体在催化运行后浓度逐渐减少，表明它们在脱氢反应中的重要性。文档还指出，在丙烷脱氢过程中催化剂表面形成无活性焦炭是催化剂失活的另一个因素。使用活性碳作为Fe氧化物催化剂的支持材料显示出在CO2-ODHP中的潜力，因为它能够增强催化剂的活性和选择性，特别是在Fe含量约为5 wt.%时。在描述的条件下，CO2在催化过程中的有效性有限，表明它在Fe氧化物的还原循环中的作用较小。
