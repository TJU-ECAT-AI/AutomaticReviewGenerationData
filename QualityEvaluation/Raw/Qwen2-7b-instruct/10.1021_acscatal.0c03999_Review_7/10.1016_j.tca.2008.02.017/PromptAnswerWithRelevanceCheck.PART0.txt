The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and the properties of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. The catalytic activity is enhanced by the presence of carbon dioxide, which promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane through several mechanisms. These include direct oxidation of propane to propene, hydrogen consumption by the reverse water-gas shift reaction, and coke gasification. The support materials play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity, as their properties can affect the distribution and reactivity of the Fe oxide catalyst. In the context of Fe2O3/AC, the active carbon support provides a large surface area and can stabilize the Fe oxide catalyst, contributing to the overall catalytic performance. The thermal analysis method, specifically through TG (Thermogravimetric Analysis), helps elucidate the reasons behind the deactivation of the catalyst, revealing the importance of both the reduction of active sites due to the formation of inactive coke and the decomposition of surface groups during the reaction process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料性质的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。通过几种机制促进丙烷的氧化脱氢，包括直接氧化丙烷为丙烯、氢消耗的逆水煤气变换反应以及焦炭气化。支持材料对催化活性起着关键作用，其性质可以影响催化剂Fe氧化物的分布和活性。在Fe2O3/AC的情况下，活性碳支持提供了大量的表面积，并可以稳定Fe氧化物催化剂，从而贡献到整体催化性能。通过热重分析（TG）方法研究催化剂的失活原因，揭示了活性位点由于形成无活性焦炭的分解和反应过程中表面组分的分解而导致催化剂失活的重要性。

<p>The CrOx-containing active carbons appeared to be extremely active catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. It was found that the catalytic activity and selectivity strongly depended on the Cr loading. The highest propane conversions were achieved for the sample with the Cr content closed to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the formation of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the catalytic activity.</p>

<p>The thermal analysis method was applied to study the reasons of the activity loss. TG experiments performed in the flow of inert gas showed that the active carbon support exhibited the presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species which played a role in the catalytic process. A gradual decrease in the surface concentration of these groups was observed after the catalytic run. On the other hand, inactive coke was formed in the course of the propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst surface. This effect was confirmed by TG measurements in the O2-rich atmosphere. Additionally, it was proved that CO2 was practically inert in a relation to the carbonaceous support in the conditions used during the catalytic process.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity. The presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species on the active carbon support contributes to the catalytic process, but their gradual decrease upon the catalytic run indicates a potential mechanism for catalyst deactivation. Inactive coke formation on the catalyst surface further diminishes the activity over time. The study highlights the importance of the interplay between the redox properties of the Fe oxide, the support material characteristics, and the effect of CO2 on the catalytic activity and deactivation pathways.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC combinations. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. As per the document, the presence of carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species on the active carbon support contributes to the catalytic process. These groups gradually decrease in concentration after the catalytic run, suggesting their importance in the dehydrogenation reaction. The document also indicates that the formation of inactive coke on the catalyst surface during the propane dehydrogenation process is another factor contributing to the catalyst's deactivation. The use of active carbon as a support material for Fe oxide catalysts shows promise in CO2-ODHP due to its ability to enhance the activity and selectivity of the catalyst, especially when the Fe content is around 5 wt.%. The effectiveness of CO2 in the catalytic process is limited under the conditions described, indicating its minor role in the redox cycle of Fe oxide.
