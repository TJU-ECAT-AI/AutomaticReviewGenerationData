The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the study. The catalysts showed enhanced performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity when the Fe/Ce ratio was increased, leading to suppression of propane cracking. The synthesized catalysts exhibited stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours. The deactivation mechanisms were found to vary depending on the Fe loading. Low Fe catalysts deactivated due to coke deposition on the surface, whereas high Fe loading catalysts experienced deactivation primarily due to CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the study. Reducibility of the Fe oxide and the support material, particularly the Fe2O3/AC combination, influenced catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involved the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The introduction of Fe3+ into the ceria lattice with varying Fe/Ce molar ratios enhanced stability and catalytic performance. The ceria-based catalysts exhibited improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity, forming a stable surface active site. At higher Fe/Ce ratios, the propane oxidative dehydrogenation pathway was enhanced, and propane cracking was suppressed. The catalysts showed stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours with moderate Fe loading. Post-reaction analysis through ex-situ Raman, XPS, and STEM confirmed the deactivation mechanisms, which were coke deposition on the surface for low Fe catalysts and CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals for high Fe loading catalysts.

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the study demonstrates that catalyst reducibility and support materials significantly influence catalytic activity. Specifically, the incorporation of Fe oxide into ceria creates a redox-active site that facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 as the oxidant. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) during the reaction, promoting the breaking of C-H bonds in propane. This reduction enhances the activation of CO2, enabling the formation of propylene and hydrogen. 

The support material, particularly ceria, plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Fe oxide species and providing a surface for the adsorption of reactants and products. The study confirms that catalysts with a high Fe/Ce ratio exhibit enhanced activity in the ODH pathway, indicating an optimized balance between the redox activity of Fe and the oxygen storage capacity of ceria. Moreover, the use of ceria as the support material ensures stable conversion and high propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours, demonstrating the robustness of the catalyst under continuous operation.

The deactivation mechanisms of the catalysts are attributed to the surface formation of coke for low Fe loading catalysts, leading to a decrease in surface area and accessibility for reactants. For high Fe loading catalysts, the primary causes of deactivation include the sintering of CeO2, which reduces the surface area and porosity, and the migration of Fe to form nanocrystals, disrupting the catalyst's structure and activity. The application of ex-situ techniques like Raman, XPS, and STEM confirms these deactivation pathways and highlights the importance of optimizing the Fe loading and calcination conditions to maintain catalyst stability and activity.

In summary, the study reveals that Fe oxide-based catalysts supported on ceria offer a promising approach for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability. The redox cycle of Fe oxide and the synergistic effect between Fe and ceria are key factors driving the catalytic performance, while careful control of the catalyst preparation parameters is essential to prevent deactivation and maintain high efficiency.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，研究显示催化剂还原性和支持材料对催化活性的影响。具体来说，在铈中掺杂铁氧化物形成了一个可逆性中心，促进了丙烷与二氧化碳作为氧化剂的氧化脱氢。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，在该循环中，铁（III）在反应期间被还原为铁（II），促进丙烷中C-H键的断裂。这种还原增强了二氧化碳的活化，使得丙烯和氢的形成成为可能。

支持材料，尤其是铈，对于稳定铁氧化物物种和提供吸附反应物和产物的表面起着关键作用。研究表明，高Fe/Ce比例的催化剂在ODH途径中表现出增强的活性，表明Fe和铈氧存储能力之间优化平衡的存在。此外，使用铈作为支持材料确保了稳定的转化和长达20小时的高丙烯选择性，这证明了催化剂在连续操作下的稳定性。

催化剂失活机制被归因于低Fe负载催化剂表面形成焦炭，导致表面积减少和反应物可达性降低。对于高Fe负载催化剂，主要的失活原因包括铈氧化物的烧结，减少了表面积和孔隙率，以及铁迁移到形成纳米晶体，破坏了催化剂的结构和活性。应用诸如拉曼、XPS和STEM等离线技术确认了这些失活路径，并强调了优化Fe负载和煅烧条件以保持催化剂稳定性和活性的重要性。

综上所述，研究表明，铈基铁氧化物催化剂提供了在二氧化碳辅助下高效氧化脱氢丙烷的有前景的方法，具有增强的活性、选择性和稳定性。铁氧化物的氧化还原循环和Fe和铈之间的协同效应是推动催化性能的关键因素，而仔细控制催化剂制备参数对于防止失活并维持高效率至关重要。

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the study highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The reducibility of Fe oxides plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity, as evidenced by the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and the dehydrogenation of propane. The Fe2O3 support material enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst, allowing for better conversion and selectivity of propane to propylene under CO2-assisted conditions.
