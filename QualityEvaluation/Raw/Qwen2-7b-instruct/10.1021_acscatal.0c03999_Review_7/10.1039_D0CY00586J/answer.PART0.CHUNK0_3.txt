Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the study highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The reducibility of Fe oxides plays a crucial role in their catalytic activity, as evidenced by the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and the dehydrogenation of propane. The Fe2O3 support material enhances the stability and activity of the catalyst, allowing for better conversion and selectivity of propane to propylene under CO2-assisted conditions. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the Fe oxide catalysts undergoing a redox cycle that activates CO2, enabling the formation of reactive species capable of reacting with propane to produce propylene. The study demonstrates that the introduction of Fe3+ into the ceria lattice, with optimized Fe/Ce molar ratios, leads to enhanced stability and improved catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP, benefiting from the well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity of ceria-based catalysts. This approach enables the formation of stable surface active sites that are conducive to the efficient conversion of propane to propylene under mild conditions, utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant.
