1. The use of CO2 as an alternative oxidant in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane offers benefits such as avoiding deep oxidation, reducing coke formation, and enhancing propane conversion due to the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

2. A series of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts were reported to exhibit improved stability and catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as the oxidant.

3. Iron (Fe3+) was introduced into the ceria lattice to create a solid solution, which is active for propane dehydrogenation and CO2 activation.

4. Calcination at 600°C resulted in a higher specific surface area and formation of a Fe-Ce solid solution, rather than separate cerianite and hematite phases.
