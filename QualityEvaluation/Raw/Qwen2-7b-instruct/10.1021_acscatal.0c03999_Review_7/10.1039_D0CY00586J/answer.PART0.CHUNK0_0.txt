[1] "Propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) in the presence of CO2 was investigated over a series of Fe-doped CeO2 catalysts."
[2] "Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed."
[3] "Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours was achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading."
[4] "Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the study. The catalysts showed enhanced performance in terms of propane conversion and propylene selectivity when the Fe/Ce ratio was increased, leading to suppression of propane cracking. The synthesized catalysts exhibited stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours. The deactivation mechanisms were found to vary depending on the Fe loading. Low Fe catalysts deactivated due to coke deposition on the surface, whereas high Fe loading catalysts experienced deactivation primarily due to CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals.

研究分析了Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的表现。随着Fe/Ce比例的增加，催化剂在促进丙烷转化和提高丙烯选择性的同时抑制了丙烷裂解，表现出良好的性能。合成的催化剂能够在长达20小时的时间内保持稳定的丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。低Fe负载的催化剂由于表面焦炭沉积而失效，而高Fe负载的催化剂主要由于CeO2团聚和Fe迁移形成纳米晶体导致失效。
