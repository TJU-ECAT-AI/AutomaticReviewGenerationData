<p>The use of CO2 as, alternative to oxygen, soft oxidant has the potential to i) avoid deep oxidation of alkanes/alkenes, ii) reduce coke formation and iii) favor propane conversion due to participation of the produced hydrogen in the reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS).</p>
<p>In this work, we report a series of Fe doped CeO2 as catalysts that show enhanced stability and promising catalytic performance for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation using CO2 as soft oxidant.</p>
<p>To that end, we introduce Fe3+, which is proved to be active for propane dehydrogenation as well as CO2 activation, into ceria lattice with a series of Fe/Ce molar ratios.</p>
<p>The well-reported oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria based catalysts sets the foundation and main hypothesis of this work towards the formation of stable surface active sites.</p>
<p>As shown in the Supporting Information, (Figures S1, Table S1) calcination at 600°C is beneficial in the following aspects: higher specific surface area and formation of Fe-Ce solid solution rather than two separated cerianite-hematite phases is achieved.</p>
<p>The well-recognized properties of cerium oxide materials regarding improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) was utilized towards the synthesis of stable catalytic systems.</p>
<p>Initial screening of catalytic behavior showed that propane ODH pathway was enhanced at high Fe/Ce ratio while propane cracking was suppressed.</p>
<p>Stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours was achieved for the synthesized catalysts with moderate Fe loading.</p>
<p>Ex-situ Raman, XPS and STEM was applied to analyze post-reaction catalyst and confirmed that deactivation occurred over low Fe catalysts were resulted from coke deposition on the surface, while CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals were the primary deactivation reasons for high Fe loading catalysts.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the study. Reducibility of the Fe oxide and the support material, particularly the Fe2O3/AC combination, influenced catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involved the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The introduction of Fe3+ into the ceria lattice with varying Fe/Ce molar ratios enhanced stability and catalytic performance. The ceria-based catalysts exhibited improved oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity, forming a stable surface active site. At higher Fe/Ce ratios, the propane oxidative dehydrogenation pathway was enhanced, and propane cracking was suppressed. The catalysts showed stable propane conversion and high propylene selectivity for up to 20 hours with moderate Fe loading. Post-reaction analysis through ex-situ Raman, XPS, and STEM confirmed the deactivation mechanisms, which were coke deposition on the surface for low Fe catalysts and CeO2 sintering and Fe migration to form nanocrystals for high Fe loading catalysts.

研究分析了Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。Fe氧化物的可还原性和支撑材料，特别是Fe2O3/AC组合，影响了催化活性。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。通过将Fe3+引入铈氧化物晶格中，并且随着Fe/Ce摩尔比的变化，提高了稳定性与催化性能。铈基催化剂表现出改进的氧移动性和氧存储能力，形成了稳定的表面活性位点。在较高的Fe/Ce比下，丙烷氧化脱氢途径增强，而丙烷裂解被抑制。催化剂显示了稳定丙烷转化和高丙烯选择性长达20小时，在适度的Fe负载下。后处理反应分析通过离线拉曼、XPS和STEM证实了失活机制，低Fe催化剂表面沉积焦炭导致失活，而高Fe负载催化剂的CeO2烧结和Fe迁移形成纳米晶体是主要的失活原因。
