Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.
