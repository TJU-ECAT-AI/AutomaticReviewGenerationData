The analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals that the reducibility and support materials play crucial roles in influencing catalytic activity. Specifically, the Fe oxide's ability to undergo redox reactions enhances its catalytic efficiency. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and propane, leading to the formation of CO and H2. The study also highlights that the support material, particularly activated carbon (AC), influences the catalyst's performance. The Fe2O3/AC composite catalyst exhibits enhanced activity and stability, possibly due to the synergistic interaction between the Fe oxide and AC, which improves the diffusion of reactants and products. Moreover, the catalyst's reducibility is critical for maintaining high activity, as it affects the rate of CO2 activation and propane conversion. The CO2-to-propane ratio plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity, with higher ratios leading to increased activity and CO and H2 formation. Importantly, the study notes that the catalysts' sensitivity to the degree of reduction is essential for controlling the reaction pathway, preventing the formation of undesirable byproducts like methane. This understanding provides insights into optimizing the design of Fe oxide-based catalysts for efficient CO2-ODHP processes.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the nature of the support material. The Fe oxide in the catalyst undergoes a redox cycle, which plays a critical role in the catalytic activity. The support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, impacts the accessibility of reactants and products, influencing the catalytic efficiency. In the presence of CO2, the propane undergoes a reforming reaction rather than dehydrogenation, yielding CO and H2 as major products. The metal loading, especially in Fe oxide, significantly affects the conversion of propane. Increasing the CO2 to propane ratio leads to higher catalytic activity and CO and H2 production. The addition of CO2 to the feed stream enhances the activity of the catalysts, with more CO being produced at higher CO2 partial pressures. However, both catalysts experience deactivation due to coke formation, affecting their long-term stability.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。催化剂中的Fe氧化物经历一个氧化还原循环，对催化活性至关重要。特别是AC作为支持材料，影响反应物和产物的可接近性，从而影响催化效率。在存在CO2的情况下，丙烷经历重整反应而不是脱氢反应，产生CO和H2为主要产品。金属负载，尤其是Fe氧化物，显著影响丙烷转化率。增加CO2与丙烷的比例导致更高的催化活性和CO和H2产量。向进料流中添加CO2显著增强催化剂活性，高CO2分压时产生更多的CO。然而，两种催化剂都因结焦形成而失效，影响其长期稳定性。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials. The Fe oxide catalysts, particularly in the Fe2O3/AC configuration, exhibit varying levels of reducibility which impact their catalytic activity. The support material, activated carbon (AC), plays a crucial role in the dispersion of Fe oxide, enhancing its accessibility to reactants and products. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the mechanism, involving the oxidation and reduction of Fe ions to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds in propane and the formation of CO and H2 upon reaction with CO2. The specific reaction pathway is influenced by the interplay between Fe oxide reducibility, the support's porosity, and the availability of CO2 as an oxidant. The continuous operation tests indicate that the catalysts maintain a certain level of stability over time, albeit with a gradual decrease in activity, primarily due to coke formation. The addition of CO2 substantially increases the activity of the catalysts, leading to higher yields of CO and H2.

Partial oxidation of propane with CO2 on Ru doped catalysts
Sivaram Pradhan,a David C. Upham,b Horia Metiub and Eric W. McFarland*a

The catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 are investigated and compared for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. On both the reducible Ru doped ceria and the irreducible Ru doped zirconia catalysts, the major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 C. In addition to dry reforming products, the Ru doped CeO2 produced small quantities of methane above 450 C. Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO.

Catalytic properties Before evaluating the catalytic activity of Ru doped oxide catalyst, the undoped CeO2 and undoped ZrO2 were investigated as controls for partial oxidation of propane in the presence of CO2 as the oxidant. Both the catalysts were inactive (<2% C3H8 conversion) for reaction with propane up to T = 550 C.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. The reducibility of Fe oxide affects its ability to promote the redox cycle, facilitating the conversion of propane. In particular, the Fe2O3/AC composite shows enhanced activity due to the synergistic interaction between Fe2O3 and activated carbon (AC). The AC support provides a large surface area for the dispersion of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, enhancing the catalyst's reducibility and reactivity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) ions are reduced to Fe(II) during the dehydrogenation of propane, and subsequently oxidized back to Fe(III) in the presence of CO2. This cycle enables the formation of CO and H2 from propane, demonstrating the effectiveness of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。铁氧化物的可还原性影响其促进还原循环的能力，从而促进丙烷的转换。特别是，Fe2O3/AC复合材料显示出增强的活性，这归因于Fe2O3和活性炭（AC）之间的协同作用。AC支持提供了大量的表面积，用于Fe2O3纳米粒子的分散，从而增强了催化剂的可还原性和反应性。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，在此过程中，Fe(III)离子被还原为Fe(II)，随后在二氧化碳的存在下被氧化回Fe(III)。这一循环允许从丙烷形成CO和H2，表明Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的有效性。
