[1] "The catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 are investigated and compared for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant."
[2] "Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO."
[3] "In the absence of CO2, very little propane conversion was observed for either catalyst, and propane was not converted at all below 450 C."
[4] "The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for both these catalysts."
[5] "Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (22% conversion)."
[6] "As the oxidant (CO2) to propane ratio increases, the catalytic activity increases and as well CO and H2 formation increased."
[7] "During propane partial oxidation, the more oxidized catalyst does not favor methane formation, which is consistent with the prior work showing the sensitivity of catalyst to the degree of reduction."

The analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals that the reducibility and support materials play crucial roles in influencing catalytic activity. Specifically, the Fe oxide's ability to undergo redox reactions enhances its catalytic efficiency. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and propane, leading to the formation of CO and H2. The study also highlights that the support material, particularly activated carbon (AC), influences the catalyst's performance. The Fe2O3/AC composite catalyst exhibits enhanced activity and stability, possibly due to the synergistic interaction between the Fe oxide and AC, which improves the diffusion of reactants and products. Moreover, the catalyst's reducibility is critical for maintaining high activity, as it affects the rate of CO2 activation and propane conversion. The CO2-to-propane ratio plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity, with higher ratios leading to increased activity and CO and H2 formation. Importantly, the study notes that the catalysts' sensitivity to the degree of reduction is essential for controlling the reaction pathway, preventing the formation of undesirable byproducts like methane. This understanding provides insights into optimizing the design of Fe oxide-based catalysts for efficient CO2-ODHP processes.
