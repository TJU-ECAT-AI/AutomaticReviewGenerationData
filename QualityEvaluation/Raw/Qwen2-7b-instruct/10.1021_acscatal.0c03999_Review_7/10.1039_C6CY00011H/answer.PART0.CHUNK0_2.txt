The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials. The Fe oxide catalysts, particularly in the Fe2O3/AC configuration, exhibit varying levels of reducibility which impact their catalytic activity. The support material, activated carbon (AC), plays a crucial role in the dispersion of Fe oxide, enhancing its accessibility to reactants and products. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the mechanism, involving the oxidation and reduction of Fe ions to facilitate the breaking of C-H bonds in propane and the formation of CO and H2 upon reaction with CO2. The specific reaction pathway is influenced by the interplay between Fe oxide reducibility, the support's porosity, and the availability of CO2 as an oxidant. The continuous operation tests indicate that the catalysts maintain a certain level of stability over time, albeit with a gradual decrease in activity, primarily due to coke formation. The addition of CO2 substantially increases the activity of the catalysts, leading to higher yields of CO and H2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响。特别是Fe2O3/AC配置的Fe氧化物催化剂，其还原性不同，对催化活性产生影响。支持材料活性炭（AC）在Fe氧化物的分散中起着关键作用，增强其对反应物和产物的可接近性。Fe氧化物的红ox循环是机制的核心，涉及Fe离子的氧化和还原，以促进丙烷中C-H键的断裂，并在与CO2反应时形成CO和H2。特定的反应路径受到Fe氧化物还原性、支持材料的孔隙率以及CO2作为氧化剂的可用性的相互作用的影响。连续操作测试表明，催化剂在一段时间内保持一定的稳定性，但其活动度逐渐下降，主要是由于焦炭形成导致的。向系统中添加CO2显著提高催化剂的活性，导致CO和H2的更高产率。
