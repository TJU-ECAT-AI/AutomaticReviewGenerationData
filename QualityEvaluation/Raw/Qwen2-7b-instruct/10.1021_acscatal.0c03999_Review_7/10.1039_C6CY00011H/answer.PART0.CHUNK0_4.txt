1. The utilization of carbon dioxide as a reactant in chemical conversions holds significant importance in both theoretical and practical aspects.

2. Nickel-based and noble metal-based catalysts (such as Pt, Rh, Pd) have been documented for propane reforming applications.

3. The catalyst's effectiveness varies across a spectrum of conditions, including temperature, feed ratios, and space times.

4. Without carbon dioxide, both catalysts failed to convert propane, and propane was not converted below 450°C.

5. The primary products identified were carbon monoxide and hydrogen, with no detection of propylene for both catalysts.

6. Under oxidative conditions, 5% ruthenium-doped ceria demonstrated higher activity (53% conversion) than 5% ruthenium-doped zirconia (22% conversion).

7. The impact of the CO2/C3H8 ratio on the performance of 5% ruthenium-doped ceria is illustrated in Figure 10.

8. Given the presence of reducing gases like propane, propylene, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen during propane partial oxidation, CO-methanation is not anticipated to occur.

1. 将二氧化碳作为反应物在化学转化中的应用具有重要的理论和实践意义。

2. 镍基和贵金属基催化剂（如Pt、Rh、Pd）已被记录用于丙烷重整。

3. 催化剂的有效性随温度、进料比例和空间时间等条件的变化而变化。

4. 在没有二氧化碳的情况下，两种催化剂都无法将丙烷转化为产物，并且在低于450°C时丙烷无法被转换。

5. 主要产物是二氧化碳和氢气，这两种催化剂中都没有检测到丙烯。

6. 在氧化条件下，5% 钨酸铈复合的催化剂比5% 钨酸锆复合的催化剂显示出更高的活性（53% 转化率），后者为22%。

7. 图10显示了5% 钨酸铈复合催化剂对CO2/C3H8比率的性能影响。

8. 给出丙烷部分氧化过程中存在还原气体如丙烷、丙烯、一氧化碳和氢气的情况，预期不会发生CO甲烷化。
