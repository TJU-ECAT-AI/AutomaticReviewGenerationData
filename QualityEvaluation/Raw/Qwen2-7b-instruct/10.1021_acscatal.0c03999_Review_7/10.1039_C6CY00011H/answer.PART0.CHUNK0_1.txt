[1] "The catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 are investigated and compared for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant."
[2] "Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO."
[3] "In the absence of CO2, very little propane conversion was observed for either catalyst, and propane was not converted at all below 450 C."
[4] "As the oxidant (CO2) to propane ratio increases, the catalytic activity increases and as well CO and H2 formation increased."
[5] "In presence of CO2 propane makes significant amount of H2 and CO. Instead of dehydrogenation reaction, CO2 reforming reaction takes place."
[6] "The major products detected were CO and H2 (Fig. 9)."
[7] "Despite incorporation into different host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest effect on propane conversion."
[8] "Co-feeding CO2 substantially increased the activity for both catalysts and more CO was observed at high partial pressures of CO2."
[9] "Both catalysts suffered from deactivation from coke formation."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the nature of the support material. The Fe oxide in the catalyst undergoes a redox cycle, which plays a critical role in the catalytic activity. The support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, impacts the accessibility of reactants and products, influencing the catalytic efficiency. In the presence of CO2, the propane undergoes a reforming reaction rather than dehydrogenation, yielding CO and H2 as major products. The metal loading, especially in Fe oxide, significantly affects the conversion of propane. Increasing the CO2 to propane ratio leads to higher catalytic activity and CO and H2 production. The addition of CO2 to the feed stream enhances the activity of the catalysts, with more CO being produced at higher CO2 partial pressures. However, both catalysts experience deactivation due to coke formation, affecting their long-term stability.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。催化剂中的Fe氧化物经历一个氧化还原循环，对催化活性至关重要。特别是AC作为支持材料，影响反应物和产物的可接近性，从而影响催化效率。在存在CO2的情况下，丙烷经历重整反应而不是脱氢反应，产生CO和H2为主要产品。金属负载，尤其是Fe氧化物，显著影响丙烷转化率。增加CO2与丙烷的比例导致更高的催化活性和CO和H2产量。向进料流中添加CO2显著增强催化剂活性，高CO2分压时产生更多的CO。然而，两种催化剂都因结焦形成而失效，影响其长期稳定性。
