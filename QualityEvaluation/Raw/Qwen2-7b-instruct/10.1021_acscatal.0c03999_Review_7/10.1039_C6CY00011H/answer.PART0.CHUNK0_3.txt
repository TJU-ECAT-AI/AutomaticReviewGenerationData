Partial oxidation of propane with CO2 on Ru doped catalysts
Sivaram Pradhan,a David C. Upham,b Horia Metiub and Eric W. McFarland*a

The catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 are investigated and compared for the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. On both the reducible Ru doped ceria and the irreducible Ru doped zirconia catalysts, the major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 C. In addition to dry reforming products, the Ru doped CeO2 produced small quantities of methane above 450 C. Neither catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with CO2 or CO.

Catalytic properties Before evaluating the catalytic activity of Ru doped oxide catalyst, the undoped CeO2 and undoped ZrO2 were investigated as controls for partial oxidation of propane in the presence of CO2 as the oxidant. Both the catalysts were inactive (<2% C3H8 conversion) for reaction with propane up to T = 550 C.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. The reducibility of Fe oxide affects its ability to promote the redox cycle, facilitating the conversion of propane. In particular, the Fe2O3/AC composite shows enhanced activity due to the synergistic interaction between Fe2O3 and activated carbon (AC). The AC support provides a large surface area for the dispersion of Fe2O3 nanoparticles, enhancing the catalyst's reducibility and reactivity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) ions are reduced to Fe(II) during the dehydrogenation of propane, and subsequently oxidized back to Fe(III) in the presence of CO2. This cycle enables the formation of CO and H2 from propane, demonstrating the effectiveness of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。铁氧化物的可还原性影响其促进还原循环的能力，从而促进丙烷的转换。特别是，Fe2O3/AC复合材料显示出增强的活性，这归因于Fe2O3和活性炭（AC）之间的协同作用。AC支持提供了大量的表面积，用于Fe2O3纳米粒子的分散，从而增强了催化剂的可还原性和反应性。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，在此过程中，Fe(III)离子被还原为Fe(II)，随后在二氧化碳的存在下被氧化回Fe(III)。这一循环允许从丙烷形成CO和H2，表明Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的有效性。
