[1] "Molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations catalyze both alkane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, and these functionalities can be tuned via co-feed of H2 and/or CO2."
[2] "Propane conversion was observed over Mo2C at 823 K both in absence of a co-feed and under three separate co-feed regimes:(i) CO2 co-feed, (ii) H2 co-feed, and (iii) H2/CO2 co-feed."
[3] "Concurrent co-feed of CO2 and H2 results in the highest conversion of propane with a typical dehydrogenation selectivity of 55%; the remaining 45% of propane is converted via CAC scission pathways to form C1 and C2 compounds, with reforming CO dominating the selectivity among CAC scission products."
[4] "Dehydrogenation can be modeled by a two-site mechanism with dehydrogenation events being catalyzed by three distinct site pairs: oxidized OAO site pairs, carbidic A site pairs, and cooperative OA site pairs. Dehydrogenation catalyzed by OA site pairs results in the highest observed rates of dehydrogenation."
[5] "Transient and steady state kinetic modeling were used in conjunction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were calculated from both transient and steady state models."
[6] "Presence of H2 co-feed leads to CAC scission, and O is postulated to inhibit hydrogenolysis pathways that are dependent upon ensembles of sites to accommodate dehydrogenated alkyl intermediates that precede CAC scission."
[7] "Occlusion of O and rapid bulk O diffusion relative to the rate of O-removal via surface reduction allows for a direct comparison between rates of surface reduction and time constants extracted from observed dehydrogenation transients."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play crucial roles in determining catalytic activity. Reducibility affects the accessibility of active sites for the reaction, while the support material influences the dispersion of the active catalyst, impacting its surface area and interaction with the reactants.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide includes the following steps:

1. **Reduction**: Fe oxide is reduced by CO2, leading to the formation of Fe(II) species. This reduction step is critical for creating active sites on the catalyst surface.

2. **Activation of Propane**: The reduced Fe(II) sites become active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface and undergo dehydrogenation, forming propylene and hydrogen.

3. **Oxidation**: After dehydrogenation, the active sites undergo oxidation, returning to the Fe(III) state. This oxidation step is necessary for regenerating the catalyst and allowing it to cycle through the reaction process.

4. **Reduction of CO2**: The Fe(III) species can further reduce CO2 to CO, which helps in maintaining the redox cycle and enhancing the overall catalytic activity.

5. **Formation of Products**: Propylene and CO are the primary products formed in this process. The efficiency of the reaction depends on the balance between the reduction and oxidation steps, as well as the catalyst's ability to facilitate the activation and deactivation of the active sites.

The influence of Fe oxide reducibility and support materials on catalytic activity highlights the importance of optimizing these parameters for efficient CO2-ODHP. High reducibility ensures that the catalyst can readily form active sites, while the support material influences the distribution and stability of these sites, affecting the overall reaction kinetics and product selectivity.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the mechanism of CO2-ODHP, enabling the catalyst to efficiently convert propane into valuable products like propylene, while utilizing CO2 as an oxidant. This process not only facilitates the production of useful chemicals but also contributes to sustainable waste management by utilizing CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a reactant.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受几个因素的影响。催化剂的可还原性以及支持材料，特别是Fe2O3/AC，在确定催化活性方面起着关键作用。可还原性影响了反应中活性位点的可接近性，而支持材料影响了催化剂的分散性，从而影响其表面积和与反应物的相互作用。

CO2-ODHP涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环的拟议反应机制包括以下步骤：

1. **还原**：Fe氧化物被CO2还原，形成了Fe(II)物种。这一还原步骤对于在催化剂表面形成活性位点至关重要。

2. **丙烷活化**：还原后的Fe(II)位点成为氧化脱氢丙烷的活性位点。丙烷分子吸附到催化剂表面并发生脱氢反应，形成丙烯和氢气。

3. **氧化**：脱氢后，活性位点经历氧化，回到Fe(III)状态。这一氧化步骤对于再生催化剂并允许其循环通过反应过程是必要的。

4. **CO2的还原**：Fe(III)物种可以进一步还原CO2为CO，这有助于维持氧化还原循环，并增强催化剂的整体活性。

5. **产物形成**：丙烯和CO是这一过程中主要形成的产物。反应效率取决于还原和氧化步骤之间的平衡，以及催化剂促进活性位点激活和去激活的能力。

Fe氧化物的可还原性和支持材料对催化活性的影响强调了优化这些参数以实现高效CO2-ODHP的重要性。高可还原性确保了催化剂能够快速形成活性位点，而支持材料影响了这些位点的分布和稳定性，从而影响整体反应动力学和产物选择性。

Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环是CO2-ODHP机制的核心，使催化剂能够有效地将丙烷转化为有价值的产物，同时利用CO2作为氧化剂。这一过程不仅促进了有用化学品的生产，而且通过将温室气体CO2用作反应物来促进可持续废物管理。
