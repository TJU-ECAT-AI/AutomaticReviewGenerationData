Analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reveals that the catalyst's activity and selectivity are significantly influenced by its reducibility and support material properties. Specifically, the presence of sulfur in Fe2O3/AC catalysts significantly enhances their activity, enabling high propane conversion rates of 95% at 400°C and high propane selectivity of 98% at 450°C. The reducibility of Fe oxides plays a critical role, as it affects the catalyst's ability to effectively promote the desired reactions. Additionally, supports with high surface area, such as activated carbon (AC), facilitate better dispersion of metal oxide particles, thereby boosting the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP processes.
