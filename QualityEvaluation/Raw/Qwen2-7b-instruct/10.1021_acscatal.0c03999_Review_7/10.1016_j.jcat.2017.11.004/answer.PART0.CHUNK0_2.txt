[1] "Multifunctional transition metal carbides, capable of both COx reduction [18] and alkane activation [911], provide an opportunity to use CO2 for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to produce olefins."
[2] "Solymosi et al. [9,11] reported that co-processing of CO2AC2H6 and CO2AC3H8 mixtures at ambient pressure and 850923 K over bulk and supported Mo2C resulted in 860% alkane conversion with >90% selectivity to dehydrogenation pathways below 873 K and high selectivity to CO via alkane reforming above 873 K with effluent CO/C2H4 > 10 at temperatures above 960 K."
[3] "Porosoff et al. [12] and Frank et al. [10] reported increased alkane conversion and CO selectivity over Mo2C catalysts at 773873 K and enhanced time-on-stream stability of these formulations upon introducing H2 to C3H8/CO2 or C2H6/CO2 influent mixtures (1:1:2 C3H8:CO2:H2 or 5:5:1 C2H6:CO2:H2)."
[4] "The changes in selectivity are mediated by an evolution in the coverage of oxidized (O) and carbidic () surface sites which results in an evolution of OAO, OA, and A site pairs that catalyze propane dehydrogenation."
[5] "The fraction of O in relation to  was assessed from measured CO2/CO ratios because reverse water gas shift equilibrium exists under H2/CO2 co-feed steady state reaction conditions."
[6] "Kinetic models based on the two-site dehydrogenation mechanism could be used to quantitatively describe measured rates of propane dehydrogenation at steady state with or without H2 and/or CO2 co-feed and the transient evolution in dehydrogenation rates upon removing H2 or CO2 in the influent stream to note that OA site pairs exhibit the highest rate per gram."
[7] "This study extends concepts developed for examining the catalytic effects of O coverage on oxidative light alkane conversion from transition metal catalysts to also include carbidic formulations."
[8] "Molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations catalyze both alkane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, and these functionalities can be tuned via co-feed of H2 and/or CO2."
[9] "Transient and steady state kinetic modeling were used in conjunction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were calculated from both transient and steady state models."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature suggests that catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play crucial roles in influencing catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed as the driving force behind the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Specifically, Fe2+ ions can be reduced to Fe0 by CO2, while Fe3+ ions are generated through the oxidation of propane or other alkanes. The Fe3+ ions then facilitate the dehydrogenation of the alkane to form olefins. The support material, activated carbon (AC), helps in maintaining the Fe oxide's reducibility and stability under reaction conditions, thus enhancing the catalytic efficiency. The literature also indicates that the catalyst's activity is significantly influenced by the redox potential created by the interaction between Fe oxide and CO2, leading to the selective oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with high yield and selectivity. 

Answer: Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, influence the catalytic activity in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox cycle of Fe oxide drives the process, where Fe2+ ions are reduced to Fe0 by CO2, generating Fe3+ ions that facilitate the dehydrogenation of propane to form olefins. The support material, activated carbon, maintains the Fe oxide's reducibility and stability, enhancing catalytic efficiency. The redox potential created by the interaction between Fe oxide and CO2 leads to selective oxidative dehydrogenation with high yield and selectivity.
