[1] "Molybdenum oxycarbidic formulations catalyze both alkane dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, and these functionalities can be tuned via co-feed of H2 and/or CO2."
[2] "Under conditions where H2 is present in the influent, carbon selectivity to propylene varied from 16 to 84%."
[3] "Transient kinetic modeling was used in conjunction to corroborate the model of distinct site pairs as dehydrogenation active sites, and dehydrogenation rate constants were calculated from both transient and steady state models."
[4] "Presence of H2 co-feed leads to CAC scission, and O is postulated to inhibit hydrogenolysis pathways that are dependent upon ensembles of sites to accommodate dehydrogenated alkyl intermediates that precede CAC scission."

1. Molybdenum oxycarbidic catalysts can perform both dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis processes on alkanes, and their activities can be adjusted by feeding hydrogen (H2) and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) together.
2. When hydrogen is present in the feed, the catalyst can convert propane to propylene with a carbon selectivity ranging from 16 to 84%.
3. Transient kinetic modeling was employed alongside steady-state modeling to validate the concept of distinct site pairs acting as dehydrogenation sites, and rate constants for dehydrogenation were determined using both transient and steady-state models.
4. Hydrogenolysis pathways are hindered by the presence of oxygen (O) when hydrogen is fed into the system. Oxygen is believed to inhibit pathways that rely on ensembles of sites for accommodating dehydrogenated alkyl intermediates leading to carbon-carbon bond scission.

1. 钼氧化碳化物催化剂可以催化烷烃的脱氢和氢解反应，并且可以通过共供给氢（H2）和/或二氧化碳（CO2）来调整其活性。
2. 当氢气存在于进料中时，催化剂可以将丙烷转化为丙烯，碳选择性在16%到84%之间变化。
3. 通过结合瞬态动力学建模与稳态模型验证了不同位点对脱氢作用的模型，并使用瞬态和稳态模型计算了脱氢速率常数。
4. 当向系统中提供氢时，氧气（O）的存在会阻碍氢解路径。氧气被假设抑制了依赖于一组站点来容纳前导碳-碳键断裂的去氢化中间体的路径。
