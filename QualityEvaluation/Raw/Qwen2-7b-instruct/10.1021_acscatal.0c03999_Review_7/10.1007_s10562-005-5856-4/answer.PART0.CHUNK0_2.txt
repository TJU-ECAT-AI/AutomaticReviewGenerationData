[1] "The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[2] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."

[4] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[5] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."

1. In the dehydrogenation of propane, the presence of CO2 led to a higher yield of propene and a higher selectivity to propene compared to the absence of CO2. Conversely, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were significantly higher in the absence of CO2.

2. The vanadium oxide in the catalyst was capable of being reduced within a temperature range of 723 to 873 K, and part of the reduced vanadium oxide could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K.

3. Treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 could reduce the number of these acid sites.

4. The vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could exist as V4+/V3+ in H2 and during the dehydrogenation without CO2, while it could become V5+ due to the oxidizing action of CO2 during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

1. 在丙烷脱氢过程中，二氧化碳的存在导致丙烯的产率和选择性比无二氧化碳时更高。相反，在无二氧化碳的情况下，芳烃的产率和选择性显著高于有二氧化碳时。

2. 催化剂中的钒氧化物能够在723到873 K的温度范围内被还原，并且催化剂中部分还原的钒氧化物可以在823 K下被二氧化碳重新氧化。

3. 将钒氧化物催化剂用H2处理可以增加催化剂上的酸性位点数量，而二氧化碳可以减少这些酸性位点的数量。

4. 催化剂中的钒氧化物表面的钒在H2和无二氧化碳的脱氢过程中可以存在为V4+/V3+状态，而在有二氧化碳的脱氢过程中，由于二氧化碳的氧化作用，其可以转变为V5+状态。
