[1] "In the case of the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, the pre-treatment of the catalyst with H2 hardly altered the yields of aromatics and propene and the selectivities to aromatics and to propene in the dehydrogenation."
[2] "In the case of the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, the pre-treatment of the catalyst with H2 increased the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics in the dehydrogenation of propane at 13 h of time on stream, whereas it reduced the yield of propene and the selectivity to propene and hardly altered the conversion of propane."
[3] "These findings suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play crucial roles in influencing catalytic activity. When pre-treated with H2, the catalysts showed an increase in the yield of aromatics and selectivity towards aromatics in the absence of CO2. Conversely, the presence of CO2 led to a higher yield of propene and a reduced amount of carbonaceous deposits. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed to involve the transformation of Fe oxides from V4+/V3+ states in H2 and the absence of CO2 to V5+ states in the presence of CO2, which affects the formation of acid sites and the catalytic performance of the catalysts.

在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中，Fe氧化物基催化剂的性能进行了分析。催化剂可还原性和支持材料，特别是Fe2O3/AC，在影响催化活性方面起着关键作用。当用H2预处理时，催化剂在没有CO2的情况下表现出增加芳烃产率和对芳烃的选择性。相反，在CO2的存在下，丙烯产率更高，碳沉积量更少。提出了Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，涉及从H2和无CO2状态下的V4+/V3+状态转变为有CO2状态下的V5+状态，这影响了催化剂上酸位的形成和催化性能。
