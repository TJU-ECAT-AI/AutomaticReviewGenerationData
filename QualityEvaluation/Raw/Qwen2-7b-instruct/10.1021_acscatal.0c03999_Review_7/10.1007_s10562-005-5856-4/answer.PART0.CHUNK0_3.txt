[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated at 823 K in the presence/absence of CO2. The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[2] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[3] "The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K."
[4] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[5] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the proposed reaction mechanism. When CO2 is absent, the vanadium oxide in the catalyst can be reduced to V4+/V3+, leading to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide. These acid sites contribute to a higher yield of aromatics and a larger amount of carbonaceous deposits. Conversely, in the presence of CO2, the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide remains as V5+, which does not lead to the formation of acid sites but results in a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits. The pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 reduces the number of these acid sites. The redox cycle of Fe oxide influences the catalytic activity by affecting the formation and stability of acid sites, thus impacting the selectivity and yield of products in CO2-ODHP.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性及支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在反应机理中起着关键作用。当CO2不存在时，催化剂中的钒氧化物可以被还原为V4+/V3+，导致表面钒氧化物上形成酸性位点。这些酸性位点促进了芳烃的更高产率和更多碳沉积物的产生。相反，在CO2存在的情况下，催化剂表面上的钒保持为V5+状态，这不导致酸性位点的形成，但导致丙烯的更高产率和更少碳沉积物的产生。对催化剂进行H2预处理可增加催化剂上的酸性位点数量，而CO2减少了这些酸性位点的数量。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环通过影响酸性位点的形成和稳定性，从而影响CO2-ODHP中的选择性和产物产率。
