[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated at 823 K in the presence/absence of CO2. The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[2] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[3] "In addition, the dehydrogenation of propane over bulk V2O5 in the presence/absence of CO2 was also carried out. The initial yield of aromatics in the dehy- drogenation in the absence of CO2 was three times higher than that in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The amount of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was much smaller than that during the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, as shown in figure 2."
[5] "The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K."
[6] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[7] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vana- dium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."
[8] "It is also suggested that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 could be V5+ which could not lead to the formation of acid sites but result in a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), we find that the reducibility of Fe oxide and the choice of support material significantly influence catalytic activity. Specifically, the catalyst's ability to be reduced to Fe4+/Fe3+ states facilitates the formation of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This process is hindered in the presence of CO2, which leads to the oxidation of Fe to Fe5+. As a result, the yield of propene is enhanced, while the yield of aromatics is suppressed. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the reduction phase enables the formation of active sites for dehydrogenation, and the subsequent oxidation phase by CO2 prevents the formation of these active sites, thus favoring propene production over aromatic formation. 

In the context of Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon), the support material plays a critical role in accommodating the Fe oxide particles, enhancing their dispersion, and providing a suitable environment for the redox reactions to occur efficiently. This synergy between the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support material ensures optimal catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，我们发现铁氧化物的可还原性和支撑材料的选择对催化活性有着显著影响。具体而言，催化剂能够被还原到Fe4+/Fe3+状态，促进了催化剂表面活性位点的形成，这对于丙烷脱氢为丙烯至关重要。然而，在CO2的存在下，这一过程受阻，导致Fe被氧化至Fe5+。结果，丙烯的产率得到增强，而芳香烃的产率则受到抑制。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，在还原阶段允许形成用于脱氢的活性位点，而在随后由CO2引发的氧化阶段阻止这些活性位点的形成，从而有利于丙烯生产而非芳香烃形成。

在Fe2O3/AC（活性炭）的背景下，支撑材料在容纳Fe氧化物颗粒、提高其分散性以及提供适合的环境以促进氧化还原反应发生方面发挥着关键作用。这种Fe氧化物和支撑材料之间的协同效应确保了CO2-ODHP中最佳的催化活性。
