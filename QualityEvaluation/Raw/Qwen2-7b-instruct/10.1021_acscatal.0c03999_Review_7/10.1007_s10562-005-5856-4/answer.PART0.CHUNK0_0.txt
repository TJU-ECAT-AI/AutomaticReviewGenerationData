[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated at 823 K in the presence/absence of CO2."
[2] "The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[3] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K."
[5] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[6] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of Fe oxide and the nature of the support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility affects the ability of the catalyst to reduce to Fe2+ or Fe3+, which influences its reactivity and selectivity towards the desired products. The support material, like activated carbon (AC), provides a suitable surface for the Fe oxide particles, enhancing both the stability and activity of the catalyst.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ by CO2, followed by the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by hydrogen or another reducing agent. This redox process facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, leading to the formation of propene and other hydrocarbons.

The presence of CO2 in the reaction system leads to a shift in the redox equilibrium towards the formation of Fe2+, which enhances the catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of propane. This results in a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits compared to reactions conducted in the absence of CO2. The support material, AC, helps in stabilizing the Fe oxide particles, preventing agglomeration and maintaining their surface area for better interaction with reactants.

In summary, the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support material play crucial roles in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst in CO2-ODHP. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, facilitated by CO2, drives the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in the formation of propene and minimizing side products like aromatics.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到Fe氧化物可还原性和支撑材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。可还原性影响催化剂将到Fe2+或Fe3+的能力，这影响其对所需产品的反应性和选择性。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在此过程中，Fe2+由CO2氧化为Fe3+，随后Fe3+通过还原剂（如氢气）还原为Fe2+。这个氧化还原过程促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢，导致丙烯和其它烃类化合物的形成。

CO2在反应体系中的存在导致红ox平衡向Fe2+的形成方向转移，从而增强催化剂对丙烷脱氢的活性。这导致丙烯的更高产率和碳沉积物量的减少，与没有CO2的反应相比。支撑材料，如活性炭（AC），有助于稳定Fe氧化物颗粒，防止聚集并保持其表面积以更好地与反应物相互作用。

总之，Fe氧化物的可还原性和支撑材料对于确定CO2-ODHP中催化剂的效率和选择性起着关键作用。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在CO2的促进下，驱动丙烷的氧化脱氢，导致丙烯的形成，并最小化副产品如芳香烃的生成。
