[1] "The dehydrogenation of propane over a silica-supported vanadium oxide catalyst was investigated at 823 K in the presence/absence of CO2."
[2] "The yield of propene and the selectivity to propene were higher in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2."
[3] "On the other hand, the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics were much higher in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 than those in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
[4] "The vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be reduced at temperatures ranging from 723 to 873 K and a part of the reduced vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be re-oxidized with CO2 at 823 K."
[5] "NH3 desorption studies on the vanadium oxide catalyst suggest that the pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 could increase the number of acid sites on the catalyst and that CO2 could reduce the number of the acid sites on the catalyst."
[6] "UVvis studies on the vanadium oxide in the catalyst suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of Fe oxide and the nature of the support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility affects the ability of the catalyst to reduce to Fe2+ or Fe3+, which influences its reactivity and selectivity towards the desired products. The support material, like activated carbon (AC), provides a suitable surface for the Fe oxide particles, enhancing both the stability and activity of the catalyst.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe2+ is oxidized to Fe3+ by CO2, followed by the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by hydrogen or another reducing agent. This redox process facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, leading to the formation of propene and other hydrocarbons.

The presence of CO2 in the reaction system leads to a shift in the redox equilibrium towards the formation of Fe2+, which enhances the catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of propane. This results in a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits compared to reactions conducted in the absence of CO2. The support material, AC, helps in stabilizing the Fe oxide particles, preventing agglomeration and maintaining their surface area for better interaction with reactants.

In summary, the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support material play crucial roles in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the catalyst in CO2-ODHP. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, facilitated by CO2, drives the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, resulting in the formation of propene and minimizing side products like aromatics.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到Fe氧化物可还原性和支撑材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。可还原性影响催化剂将到Fe2+或Fe3+的能力，这影响其对所需产品的反应性和选择性。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在此过程中，Fe2+由CO2氧化为Fe3+，随后Fe3+通过还原剂（如氢气）还原为Fe2+。这个氧化还原过程促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢，导致丙烯和其它烃类化合物的形成。

CO2在反应体系中的存在导致红ox平衡向Fe2+的形成方向转移，从而增强催化剂对丙烷脱氢的活性。这导致丙烯的更高产率和碳沉积物量的减少，与没有CO2的反应相比。支撑材料，如活性炭（AC），有助于稳定Fe氧化物颗粒，防止聚集并保持其表面积以更好地与反应物相互作用。

总之，Fe氧化物的可还原性和支撑材料对于确定CO2-ODHP中催化剂的效率和选择性起着关键作用。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在CO2的促进下，驱动丙烷的氧化脱氢，导致丙烯的形成，并最小化副产品如芳香烃的生成。

[1] "In the case of the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, the pre-treatment of the catalyst with H2 hardly altered the yields of aromatics and propene and the selectivities to aromatics and to propene in the dehydrogenation."
[2] "In the case of the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, the pre-treatment of the catalyst with H2 increased the yield of aromatics and the selectivity to aromatics in the dehydrogenation of propane at 13 h of time on stream, whereas it reduced the yield of propene and the selectivity to propene and hardly altered the conversion of propane."
[3] "These findings suggest that the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide in the catalyst could be V4+/V3+ in H2 and in the dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, whereas that could be V5+ in the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 by the oxidizing action of CO2."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play crucial roles in influencing catalytic activity. When pre-treated with H2, the catalysts showed an increase in the yield of aromatics and selectivity towards aromatics in the absence of CO2. Conversely, the presence of CO2 led to a higher yield of propene and a reduced amount of carbonaceous deposits. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed to involve the transformation of Fe oxides from V4+/V3+ states in H2 and the absence of CO2 to V5+ states in the presence of CO2, which affects the formation of acid sites and the catalytic performance of the catalysts.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the proposed reaction mechanism. When CO2 is absent, the vanadium oxide in the catalyst can be reduced to V4+/V3+, leading to the formation of acid sites on the surface of the vanadium oxide. These acid sites contribute to a higher yield of aromatics and a larger amount of carbonaceous deposits. Conversely, in the presence of CO2, the vanadium on the surface of vanadium oxide remains as V5+, which does not lead to the formation of acid sites but results in a higher yield of propene and a smaller amount of carbonaceous deposits. The pre-treatment of the vanadium oxide catalyst with H2 increases the number of acid sites on the catalyst, while CO2 reduces the number of these acid sites. The redox cycle of Fe oxide influences the catalytic activity by affecting the formation and stability of acid sites, thus impacting the selectivity and yield of products in CO2-ODHP.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性及支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在反应机理中起着关键作用。当CO2不存在时，催化剂中的钒氧化物可以被还原为V4+/V3+，导致表面钒氧化物上形成酸性位点。这些酸性位点促进了芳烃的更高产率和更多碳沉积物的产生。相反，在CO2存在的情况下，催化剂表面上的钒保持为V5+状态，这不导致酸性位点的形成，但导致丙烯的更高产率和更少碳沉积物的产生。对催化剂进行H2预处理可增加催化剂上的酸性位点数量，而CO2减少了这些酸性位点的数量。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环通过影响酸性位点的形成和稳定性，从而影响CO2-ODHP中的选择性和产物产率。

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), we find that the reducibility of Fe oxide and the choice of support material significantly influence catalytic activity. Specifically, the catalyst's ability to be reduced to Fe4+/Fe3+ states facilitates the formation of acid sites on the catalyst surface, which is crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This process is hindered in the presence of CO2, which leads to the oxidation of Fe to Fe5+. As a result, the yield of propene is enhanced, while the yield of aromatics is suppressed. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the reduction phase enables the formation of active sites for dehydrogenation, and the subsequent oxidation phase by CO2 prevents the formation of these active sites, thus favoring propene production over aromatic formation. 

In the context of Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon), the support material plays a critical role in accommodating the Fe oxide particles, enhancing their dispersion, and providing a suitable environment for the redox reactions to occur efficiently. This synergy between the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support material ensures optimal catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，我们发现铁氧化物的可还原性和支撑材料的选择对催化活性有着显著影响。具体而言，催化剂能够被还原到Fe4+/Fe3+状态，促进了催化剂表面活性位点的形成，这对于丙烷脱氢为丙烯至关重要。然而，在CO2的存在下，这一过程受阻，导致Fe被氧化至Fe5+。结果，丙烯的产率得到增强，而芳香烃的产率则受到抑制。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，在还原阶段允许形成用于脱氢的活性位点，而在随后由CO2引发的氧化阶段阻止这些活性位点的形成，从而有利于丙烯生产而非芳香烃形成。

在Fe2O3/AC（活性炭）的背景下，支撑材料在容纳Fe氧化物颗粒、提高其分散性以及提供适合的环境以促进氧化还原反应发生方面发挥着关键作用。这种Fe氧化物和支撑材料之间的协同效应确保了CO2-ODHP中最佳的催化活性。
