<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The role of CO2 in the soft oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over ceria-based catalysts was explored using Fe oxide-based catalysts. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC, have significant effects on catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the proposed reaction mechanism.
