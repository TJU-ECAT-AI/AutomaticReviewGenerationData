<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. In particular, the use of Fe2O3/AC supports shows significant effects on catalytic activity due to their role in the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is proposed to be involved in the reaction mechanism.
