The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has been analyzed. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, especially in the context of Fe2O3/AC, significantly influence catalytic activity. A redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed as a key component of the reaction mechanism involved in this process.
