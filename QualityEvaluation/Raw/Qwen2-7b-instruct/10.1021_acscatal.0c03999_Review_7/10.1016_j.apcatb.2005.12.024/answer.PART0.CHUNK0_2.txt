<p>The oxidizing power of CO2 at low or mild temperature has already been reported in the literature [16,17,52,57,58].</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Bernal et al. [52] reported that the support of a pre-reduced Pt/CeO2 catalyst was partly reoxidized after exposure to CO2 (300 Torr) at 200 °C.</p>
<p>Dury et al. observed higher conversion rates and lower selectivity values when some CO2 was added in the feed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) on NiMoO4 and on a mixture of NiMoO4 + a-Sb2O4 between 400 and 480 °C [16,17]. They attributed this catalytic behavior to the formation of highly active O species coming from the dissociation of CO2 during the reaction [16,17].</p>
<p>In this work, we could observe a direct spectroscopic evidence of the oxidizing power of CO2 at mild (300 °C) temperature on a Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst.</p>
