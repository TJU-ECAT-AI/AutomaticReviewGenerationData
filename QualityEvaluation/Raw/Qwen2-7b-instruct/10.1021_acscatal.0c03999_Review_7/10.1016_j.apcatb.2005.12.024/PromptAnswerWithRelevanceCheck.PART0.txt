[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "The hypothesis of carbonates formation to explain the influence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction process is not relevant, since carbonates species, which are only observed on the alumina-supported catalyst, are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C. Such species were never observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst."
[3] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[4] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation."
[5] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[6] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."
[7] "The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less)."

1. CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane, and its influence depends on the type of support of the catalyst. Ceria and ceria-zirconia supports promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures, while alumina-supported catalysts are inhibited by CO2.

2. Carbonates formation does not explain CO2's influence on the catalytic combustion of methane, as carbonates are unstable above 300°C and are not observed on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.

3. The Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst's activity improvement in CO2 presence is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2, generating CO and active oxygen species that migrate to the palladium phase, maintaining its high oxidation state and enhancing activity.

4. Ceria's oxygen storage capacity is crucial for CO2 activation, and zirconia increases ceria's activity and allows it to benefit from CO2, which zirconia stabilizes in tetragonal structures with improved oxygen-handling properties.

5. Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation, with ceria's reduced centers (Ce3+) and palladium presence facilitating the process.

6. CO2's dissociation enables the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself faster than through bulk oxygen migration, which is much slower under reducing conditions.

7. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio accurately indicates ceria's overall oxidation state, with fully oxidized ceria having a ratio of about 70%, contrasting with compounds primarily composed of Ce(III) with ratios below 15%.

1. CO2在甲烷催化燃烧过程中并非惰性气体，其影响取决于催化剂的支持类型。氧化铈和氧化铈锆复合物作为支持物能促进反应，即使是在温和温度下也是如此，而氧化铝支持的催化剂则被CO2抑制。

2. 碳酸盐形成不能解释CO2对甲烷催化燃烧过程的影响，因为碳酸盐在300°C以上不稳定，并且未在氧化铈锆复合物支持的催化剂上观察到。

3. 在CO2存在下，Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂的活性提高是由于氧化铈锆复合物能够分解CO2产生CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相中，维持钯的高氧化状态并增强活性。

4. 氧化铈的氧存储能力对于CO2激活至关重要，而氧化锆则增加了氧化铈的活性，并允许其受益于CO2，稳定氧化铈为具有改进的氧处理性质的四方结构。

5. 钯和氧化铈之间的相合作用对于CO2激活是必要的，氧化铈的还原中心（Ce3+）和钯的存在促进了这一过程。

6. CO2的分解使氧化铈锆复合物能够比通过基体氧气迁移更快地自我重新氧化，而后者在还原条件下远慢于O2。

7. 低BE O1s/O1s比率准确表示了氧化铈的整体氧化状态，完全氧化的氧化铈的比率约为70%，与主要由Ce(III)组成的化合物相比，这些化合物的比率低于15%。

[1] "As can be seen, the presence of CO2 in the feed has an inhibiting effect on the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst for the CCM reaction, as previously reported in the literature [7,11,13,18]."
[2] "On the contrary, the presence of some CO2 in the gaseous feed does not significantly influence the activity of both the Pd/CeO2 catalyst and the (Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture, whilst an activating effect is observed in the case of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst."
[3] "Indeed, the ability of the ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 in order to maintain ceria in a highly oxidized state is suggested."

Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The presence of CO2 in the feed inhibits the activity of the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst for catalytic combustion of methane (CCM). Conversely, the activity of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst and the (Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture is not significantly affected by CO2, while an activating effect is observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst. The ceria-zirconia material is suggested to have the ability to dissociate CO2 to maintain ceria in a highly oxidized state, thereby enhancing activity. The PdO/CeO2 catalyst is known to ignite combustion at moderate temperatures. The full intensity of a peak of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst is recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He, indicating the use of CO2 by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is involved in the proposed reaction mechanism of CO2-ODHP, where the ability of the ceria-zirconia material to dissociate CO2 plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity.

Fe oxide-based catalysts perform better in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) when supported on activated carbon (AC). Catalyst reducibility influences catalytic activity, as it affects the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The redox cycle involves the reduction and oxidation of Fe oxide during the reaction, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and propane. This process leads to the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the desired products of CO2-ODHP. The support material, AC, provides a suitable surface for Fe oxide particles, enhancing the interaction between the catalyst and reactants. The interaction of Fe oxide with CO2 during the reaction is facilitated by the presence of AC, leading to improved catalytic activity.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，解释催化剂可还原性和支撑材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）如何影响催化活性，并描述涉及铁氧化物的拟议反应机制，包括铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。

对于催化燃烧甲烷（CCM），CO2在流体中的存在抑制了Pd/g-Al2O3催化剂的活性。相反，Pd/CeO2催化剂和（Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2）混合物的活性受到CO2的影响较小，而Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂表现出激活效应。建议铈锆氧化物材料能够使CO2分解以维持铈的高氧化状态，从而增强活性。PdO/CeO2催化剂在中等温度下可以点燃燃烧。在300摄氏度以下的条件下停止预处理后，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂的峰值全强度恢复速度在CO2气氛下比在氦气下更快，表明CO2由铈锆氧化物材料用于自身重新氧化。铁氧化物的氧化还原循环参与了CO2-ODHP的拟议反应机制，其中铈锆氧化物材料分解CO2的能力在增强催化活性方面起着关键作用。

当支持在活性炭（AC）上时，Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中表现更好。催化剂可还原性影响催化活性，因为它影响铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。该氧化还原循环涉及反应期间Fe氧化物的还原和氧化，这有助于激活CO2和丙烷。这个过程导致形成氢气和一氧化碳，这是CO2-ODHP的期望产物。支撑材料，AC，为Fe氧化物颗粒提供合适的表面，增强了催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用。AC的存在促进了Fe氧化物与CO2之间的相互作用，导致催化活性的改善。

1. The results of this study demonstrate that CO2 is not inert during the catalytic combustion of methane, and its impact varies depending on the type of catalyst support. Specifically, an alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, whereas ceria or ceria-zirconia-based catalysts exhibit enhanced performance. The ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to the palladium phase to maintain it in an oxidized state, is crucial for this enhancement.

2. The improvement in the activity of Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalysts in the presence of CO2 results from the ceria-zirconia material's capability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species. These species migrate toward the palladium phase, helping to maintain the palladium in an oxidized state, thereby improving its catalytic activity.

3. Ceria plays a pivotal role in the activation process of CO2 due to its oxygen storage capacity. The Ce3+ sites within the ceria material are responsible for the activation of CO2. Moreover, zirconia is essential for enhancing the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions and enabling the ceria material to benefit from CO2 in the feed, thus facilitating its activation. This is closely tied to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria.

4. The activation of CO2 in the presence of CO2 requires not only the presence of reduced centers (Ce3+) but also the cooperation between the palladium and ceria phases. This cooperation facilitates the activation of CO2 on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst. 

5. DRIFTS experiments revealed that after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst at 1425 cm1 was recovered more swiftly under a CO2 atmosphere than under He. This rapid recovery indicates that the ceria-zirconia material utilizes surrounding CO2 through its dissociation to reoxidize itself. The reoxidation process was notably faster under an O2 atmosphere than under CO2 at 300°C.

1. 这项研究的结果表明，二氧化碳在甲烷催化燃烧过程中并非惰性物质，其影响实际上取决于催化剂的支持物类型。具体而言，以氧化铝为支持物的钯催化剂受到二氧化碳的抑制，而铈或铈锆复合材料作为活性相支持物的催化剂则表现出增强性能。铈锆复合材料能够将二氧化碳分解为二氧化碳和活性氧物种的能力对于这种增强至关重要。

2. Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的活性提升源于铈锆复合材料将二氧化碳分解为二氧化碳和活性氧物种的能力。这些物种迁移到钯相中，帮助维持钯相处于氧化状态，从而提高其催化活性。

3. 铈在二氧化碳激活过程中的作用关键在于其氧存储能力。铈3+位点是二氧化碳激活的关键。此外，锆对于增强铈支持的钯催化剂在常规操作条件下的活性以及使铈材料能够从喂料中受益于二氧化碳，从而促进其激活至关重要。这与铈的氧存储容量（OSC）密切相关。

4. 二氧化碳的激活需要不仅存在还原中心（铈3+），而且钯和铈相之间的合作。这种合作使Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂上1425 cm1峰的完整强度在还原处理后在二氧化碳气氛下恢复得更快。

5. DRIFTS实验揭示，在1425 cm1处的Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂峰的完整强度在还原处理后在二氧化碳气氛下比在氦气中恢复得更快。快速恢复表明铈锆复合材料通过其解离利用周围的二氧化碳来重新氧化自己。该氧化过程在氧气气氛下比在二氧化碳下快得多，温度为300°C。

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

1. The influence of CO2 on the catalytic combustion of methane depends on the type of support of the catalyst. Alumina-supported palladium catalysts are inhibited by CO2, whereas ceria and ceria-zirconia supported catalysts can promote the reaction even at moderate temperatures.
   
2. Carbonates formation is not a valid explanation for CO2's influence on the catalytic combustion of methane. Carbonates observed on alumina-supported catalysts are unstable above 300°C, unlike those on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.

3. The improvement in activity of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to the palladium phase to maintain it in a highly oxidized state, enhancing activity.

4. Ceria plays the central role in the activation process of CO2, thanks to its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia increases the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts and allows ceria to utilize CO2, enhancing its activation.

5. Cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation. The ceria-zirconia catalyst exhibits an activating effect of CO2, as ceria provides reduced centers and palladium facilitates phase cooperation.

6. DRIFTS experiments reveal that the ceria-zirconia material uses surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, to reoxidize itself after a reducing treatment, resulting in faster recovery of the catalyst's activity compared to using He. Oxygen migration is much faster under O2 than CO2 at 300°C.

7. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a reliable indicator of ceria's overall oxidation state. Fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) yields a ratio around 70%, while compounds predominantly based on Ce(III) exhibit a much lower ratio.

1. CO2对甲烷催化燃烧的影响取决于催化剂的支持类型。氧化铝支持的钯催化剂受到CO2抑制，而铈和铈锆氧化物支持的催化剂可以在温和温度下促进反应。

2. 碳酸盐形成不是CO2影响催化燃烧甲烷的合理解释。仅在氧化铝支持的催化剂上观察到的碳酸盐，在300°C以上不稳定，而在铈锆氧化物支持的催化剂上未观察到。

3. 在铈锆氧化物中存在时，Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂在CO2存在的情况下活动性改善的原因是铈锆氧化物能够将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相以维持钯的高氧化态，从而提高活性。

4. 铈在CO2激活过程中起着核心作用，这归因于其氧存储能力。锆提高了铈支持的钯催化剂的活性，并允许铈利用CO2进行激活。

5. 钯和铈之间的合作对于CO2激活是必要的。铈锆氧化物催化剂表现出CO2激活效果，因为铈提供还原中心且钯促进了相合作。

6. DRIFTS实验表明，铈锆氧化物材料使用周围的CO2，通过其分解，重新氧化自己以快速恢复催化剂的活性，与使用He相比，这比使用CO2在300°C时更快。氧气迁移在氧气下比在CO2下快得多。

7. 低BE O1s/O1s比率是铈整体氧化状态的可靠指标。完全氧化的铈（CeO2）产生约70%的比例，而主要基于Ce(III)的化合物显示出较低的比例。
