[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "The hypothesis of carbonates formation to explain the influence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction process is not relevant, since carbonates species, which are only observed on the alumina-supported catalyst, are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C. Such species were never observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst."
[3] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[4] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation."
[5] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[6] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."
[7] "The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less)."

1. CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane, and its influence depends on the type of support of the catalyst. Ceria and ceria-zirconia supports promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures, while alumina-supported catalysts are inhibited by CO2.

2. Carbonates formation does not explain CO2's influence on the catalytic combustion of methane, as carbonates are unstable above 300°C and are not observed on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.

3. The Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst's activity improvement in CO2 presence is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2, generating CO and active oxygen species that migrate to the palladium phase, maintaining its high oxidation state and enhancing activity.

4. Ceria's oxygen storage capacity is crucial for CO2 activation, and zirconia increases ceria's activity and allows it to benefit from CO2, which zirconia stabilizes in tetragonal structures with improved oxygen-handling properties.

5. Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation, with ceria's reduced centers (Ce3+) and palladium presence facilitating the process.

6. CO2's dissociation enables the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself faster than through bulk oxygen migration, which is much slower under reducing conditions.

7. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio accurately indicates ceria's overall oxidation state, with fully oxidized ceria having a ratio of about 70%, contrasting with compounds primarily composed of Ce(III) with ratios below 15%.

1. CO2在甲烷催化燃烧过程中并非惰性气体，其影响取决于催化剂的支持类型。氧化铈和氧化铈锆复合物作为支持物能促进反应，即使是在温和温度下也是如此，而氧化铝支持的催化剂则被CO2抑制。

2. 碳酸盐形成不能解释CO2对甲烷催化燃烧过程的影响，因为碳酸盐在300°C以上不稳定，并且未在氧化铈锆复合物支持的催化剂上观察到。

3. 在CO2存在下，Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂的活性提高是由于氧化铈锆复合物能够分解CO2产生CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相中，维持钯的高氧化状态并增强活性。

4. 氧化铈的氧存储能力对于CO2激活至关重要，而氧化锆则增加了氧化铈的活性，并允许其受益于CO2，稳定氧化铈为具有改进的氧处理性质的四方结构。

5. 钯和氧化铈之间的相合作用对于CO2激活是必要的，氧化铈的还原中心（Ce3+）和钯的存在促进了这一过程。

6. CO2的分解使氧化铈锆复合物能够比通过基体氧气迁移更快地自我重新氧化，而后者在还原条件下远慢于O2。

7. 低BE O1s/O1s比率准确表示了氧化铈的整体氧化状态，完全氧化的氧化铈的比率约为70%，与主要由Ce(III)组成的化合物相比，这些化合物的比率低于15%。
