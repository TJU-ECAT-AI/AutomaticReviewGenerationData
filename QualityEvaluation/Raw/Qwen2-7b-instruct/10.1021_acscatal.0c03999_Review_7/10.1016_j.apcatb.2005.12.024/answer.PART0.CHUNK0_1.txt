Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The presence of CO2 in the feed inhibits the activity of the Pd/g-Al2O3 catalyst for catalytic combustion of methane (CCM). Conversely, the activity of the Pd/CeO2 catalyst and the (Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2) mixture is not significantly affected by CO2, while an activating effect is observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst. The ceria-zirconia material is suggested to have the ability to dissociate CO2 to maintain ceria in a highly oxidized state, thereby enhancing activity. The PdO/CeO2 catalyst is known to ignite combustion at moderate temperatures. The full intensity of a peak of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst is recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He, indicating the use of CO2 by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is involved in the proposed reaction mechanism of CO2-ODHP, where the ability of the ceria-zirconia material to dissociate CO2 plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity.

Fe oxide-based catalysts perform better in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) when supported on activated carbon (AC). Catalyst reducibility influences catalytic activity, as it affects the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The redox cycle involves the reduction and oxidation of Fe oxide during the reaction, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and propane. This process leads to the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, the desired products of CO2-ODHP. The support material, AC, provides a suitable surface for Fe oxide particles, enhancing the interaction between the catalyst and reactants. The interaction of Fe oxide with CO2 during the reaction is facilitated by the presence of AC, leading to improved catalytic activity.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，解释催化剂可还原性和支撑材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）如何影响催化活性，并描述涉及铁氧化物的拟议反应机制，包括铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。

对于催化燃烧甲烷（CCM），CO2在流体中的存在抑制了Pd/g-Al2O3催化剂的活性。相反，Pd/CeO2催化剂和（Pd/g-Al2O3 + CeO2）混合物的活性受到CO2的影响较小，而Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂表现出激活效应。建议铈锆氧化物材料能够使CO2分解以维持铈的高氧化状态，从而增强活性。PdO/CeO2催化剂在中等温度下可以点燃燃烧。在300摄氏度以下的条件下停止预处理后，Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂的峰值全强度恢复速度在CO2气氛下比在氦气下更快，表明CO2由铈锆氧化物材料用于自身重新氧化。铁氧化物的氧化还原循环参与了CO2-ODHP的拟议反应机制，其中铈锆氧化物材料分解CO2的能力在增强催化活性方面起着关键作用。

当支持在活性炭（AC）上时，Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中表现更好。催化剂可还原性影响催化活性，因为它影响铁氧化物的氧化还原循环。该氧化还原循环涉及反应期间Fe氧化物的还原和氧化，这有助于激活CO2和丙烷。这个过程导致形成氢气和一氧化碳，这是CO2-ODHP的期望产物。支撑材料，AC，为Fe氧化物颗粒提供合适的表面，增强了催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用。AC的存在促进了Fe氧化物与CO2之间的相互作用，导致催化活性的改善。
