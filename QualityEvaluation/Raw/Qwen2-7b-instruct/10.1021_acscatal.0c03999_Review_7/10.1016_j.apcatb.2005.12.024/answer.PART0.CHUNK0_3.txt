[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[3] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. This would be related to the OSC of ceria."
[4] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[5] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."

1. The results of this study demonstrate that CO2 is not inert during the catalytic combustion of methane, and its impact varies depending on the type of catalyst support. Specifically, an alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, whereas ceria or ceria-zirconia-based catalysts exhibit enhanced performance. The ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to the palladium phase to maintain it in an oxidized state, is crucial for this enhancement.

2. The improvement in the activity of Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalysts in the presence of CO2 results from the ceria-zirconia material's capability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species. These species migrate toward the palladium phase, helping to maintain the palladium in an oxidized state, thereby improving its catalytic activity.

3. Ceria plays a pivotal role in the activation process of CO2 due to its oxygen storage capacity. The Ce3+ sites within the ceria material are responsible for the activation of CO2. Moreover, zirconia is essential for enhancing the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions and enabling the ceria material to benefit from CO2 in the feed, thus facilitating its activation. This is closely tied to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of ceria.

4. The activation of CO2 in the presence of CO2 requires not only the presence of reduced centers (Ce3+) but also the cooperation between the palladium and ceria phases. This cooperation facilitates the activation of CO2 on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst. 

5. DRIFTS experiments revealed that after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak on the Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst at 1425 cm1 was recovered more swiftly under a CO2 atmosphere than under He. This rapid recovery indicates that the ceria-zirconia material utilizes surrounding CO2 through its dissociation to reoxidize itself. The reoxidation process was notably faster under an O2 atmosphere than under CO2 at 300°C.

1. 这项研究的结果表明，二氧化碳在甲烷催化燃烧过程中并非惰性物质，其影响实际上取决于催化剂的支持物类型。具体而言，以氧化铝为支持物的钯催化剂受到二氧化碳的抑制，而铈或铈锆复合材料作为活性相支持物的催化剂则表现出增强性能。铈锆复合材料能够将二氧化碳分解为二氧化碳和活性氧物种的能力对于这种增强至关重要。

2. Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的活性提升源于铈锆复合材料将二氧化碳分解为二氧化碳和活性氧物种的能力。这些物种迁移到钯相中，帮助维持钯相处于氧化状态，从而提高其催化活性。

3. 铈在二氧化碳激活过程中的作用关键在于其氧存储能力。铈3+位点是二氧化碳激活的关键。此外，锆对于增强铈支持的钯催化剂在常规操作条件下的活性以及使铈材料能够从喂料中受益于二氧化碳，从而促进其激活至关重要。这与铈的氧存储容量（OSC）密切相关。

4. 二氧化碳的激活需要不仅存在还原中心（铈3+），而且钯和铈相之间的合作。这种合作使Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂上1425 cm1峰的完整强度在还原处理后在二氧化碳气氛下恢复得更快。

5. DRIFTS实验揭示，在1425 cm1处的Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂峰的完整强度在还原处理后在二氧化碳气氛下比在氦气中恢复得更快。快速恢复表明铈锆复合材料通过其解离利用周围的二氧化碳来重新氧化自己。该氧化过程在氧气气氛下比在二氧化碳下快得多，温度为300°C。
