[1] "The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures."
[2] "The hypothesis of carbonates formation to explain the influence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction process is not relevant, since carbonates species, which are only observed on the alumina-supported catalyst, are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C. Such species were never observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst."
[3] "The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity."
[4] "Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. This would be related to the OSC of ceria."
[5] "Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation."
[6] "DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C."
[7] "The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less)."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

1. The influence of CO2 on the catalytic combustion of methane depends on the type of support of the catalyst. Alumina-supported palladium catalysts are inhibited by CO2, whereas ceria and ceria-zirconia supported catalysts can promote the reaction even at moderate temperatures.
   
2. Carbonates formation is not a valid explanation for CO2's influence on the catalytic combustion of methane. Carbonates observed on alumina-supported catalysts are unstable above 300°C, unlike those on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.

3. The improvement in activity of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to the palladium phase to maintain it in a highly oxidized state, enhancing activity.

4. Ceria plays the central role in the activation process of CO2, thanks to its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia increases the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts and allows ceria to utilize CO2, enhancing its activation.

5. Cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation. The ceria-zirconia catalyst exhibits an activating effect of CO2, as ceria provides reduced centers and palladium facilitates phase cooperation.

6. DRIFTS experiments reveal that the ceria-zirconia material uses surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, to reoxidize itself after a reducing treatment, resulting in faster recovery of the catalyst's activity compared to using He. Oxygen migration is much faster under O2 than CO2 at 300°C.

7. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a reliable indicator of ceria's overall oxidation state. Fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) yields a ratio around 70%, while compounds predominantly based on Ce(III) exhibit a much lower ratio.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中的性能：

1. CO2对甲烷催化燃烧的影响取决于催化剂的支持类型。氧化铝支持的钯催化剂受到CO2抑制，而铈和铈锆氧化物支持的催化剂可以在温和温度下促进反应。

2. 碳酸盐形成不是CO2影响催化燃烧甲烷的合理解释。仅在氧化铝支持的催化剂上观察到的碳酸盐，在300°C以上不稳定，而在铈锆氧化物支持的催化剂上未观察到。

3. 在铈锆氧化物中存在时，Pd/Ce-Zr-O催化剂在CO2存在的情况下活动性改善的原因是铈锆氧化物能够将CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相以维持钯的高氧化态，从而提高活性。

4. 铈在CO2激活过程中起着核心作用，这归因于其氧存储能力。锆提高了铈支持的钯催化剂的活性，并允许铈利用CO2进行激活。

5. 钯和铈之间的合作对于CO2激活是必要的。铈锆氧化物催化剂表现出CO2激活效果，因为铈提供还原中心且钯促进了相合作。

6. DRIFTS实验表明，铈锆氧化物材料使用周围的CO2，通过其分解，重新氧化自己以快速恢复催化剂的活性，与使用He相比，这比使用CO2在300°C时更快。氧气迁移在氧气下比在CO2下快得多。

7. 低BE O1s/O1s比率是铈整体氧化状态的可靠指标。完全氧化的铈（CeO2）产生约70%的比例，而主要基于Ce(III)的化合物显示出较低的比例。
