In the realm of catalytic chemistry, the utilization of iron oxide-based catalysts in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has garnered significant attention for its potential in sustainable chemical processes. This technique involves the conversion of propane into valuable hydrocarbons using oxygen and carbon dioxide as reactants, facilitated by a catalyst. The performance of these catalysts is notably influenced by their composition and support materials, with a particular focus on the Fe2O3/AC system demonstrating exceptional activity.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, when supported on activated carbon (AC), exhibit superior performance due to the synergistic effects between the metal oxide and the carbon support. The support material plays a crucial role in enhancing the dispersion of active metal sites, improving the stability of the catalyst, and facilitating mass transport of reactants and products. In the case of Fe2O3/AC, the high surface area of the AC provides ample sites for adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, while the iron oxide particles are well dispersed, ensuring efficient contact and reaction rates.

The reaction mechanisms underlying the CO2-ODHP process are complex but can be generally described as follows: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface, followed by the sequential addition of oxygen and carbon dioxide, leading to the formation of intermediate species that undergo dehydrogenative reactions to produce hydrocarbons. The presence of CO2 is critical as it not only acts as a reactant but also aids in the stabilization of the catalyst under the high-temperature conditions required for the dehydrogenation process. The Fe2O3 component is particularly adept at promoting these reactions due to its ability to facilitate the adsorption and activation of both oxygen and carbon dioxide, thus accelerating the overall conversion efficiency.

Moreover, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst system benefits from enhanced thermal stability and resistance to sintering compared to unsupported Fe2O3, making it more durable over multiple reaction cycles. This durability, combined with its high activity and selectivity towards desired hydrocarbon products, underscores the significance of Fe2O3/AC as an efficient catalyst for CO2-ODHP, paving the way for more environmentally friendly and economically viable industrial applications.
