{"Quotes": "[1] \"The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst: the alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures.\"\n          [2] \"The hypothesis of carbonates formation to explain the influence of CO2 upon the CCM reaction process is not relevant, since carbonates species, which are only observed on the alumina-supported catalyst, are not stable under reaction conditions above 300 8C. Such species were never observed in the case of the ceria-zirconia supported catalyst.\"\n          [3] \"The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity.\"\n          [4] \"Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation.\"\n          [5] \"Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation.\"\n          [6] \"DRIFTS experiments evidenced that, after a reducing treatment, the full intensity of a peak of the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst (at 1425 cm1) was recovered faster under a CO2 atmosphere than under He (O migration from the bulk). This would result from the use of surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, by the ceria-zirconia material to reoxidize itself. However, the recovery of full intensity of the peak (reoxidation) was much faster under O2 than under CO2 at 300 8C.\"\n          [7] \"The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less).\"", "English": "Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) are influenced by CO2, depending on the catalyst support type. Ceria and ceria-zirconia supports enhance catalytic activity, possibly through CO2 dissociation into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to the palladium phase. Ceria plays a central role in CO2 activation due to its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia boosts ceria's activity and allows it to utilize CO2 for enhanced activation. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is critical in these processes, with CO2 activation facilitated by the cooperation between palladium and ceria. DRIFTS experiments suggest that CO2 aids ceria reoxidation after a reducing treatment, faster under O2 than CO2. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio is a reliable indicator of ceria's oxidation state, with fully oxidized ceria yielding a higher ratio compared to compounds based on Ce(III).", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.12.024"},
