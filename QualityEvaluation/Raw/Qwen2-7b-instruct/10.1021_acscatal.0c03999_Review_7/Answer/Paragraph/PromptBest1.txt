Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, have been thoroughly analyzed for their effectiveness in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Their superior activity is attributed to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity, and the interaction between Fe oxide catalysts and CO2 molecules facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is reduced to Fe(III) during the reaction. This redox cycle is facilitated by the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and CO2 molecules, leading to the dehydrogenation of propane. The reducibility of the Fe oxide was found to significantly influence its catalytic activity, and Fe2O3/AC showed enhanced catalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of the support material.

The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst. The alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures. The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity.

Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation.

The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less).

In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, significantly enhance CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, characterized by Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III), is pivotal in the process. Catalyst reducibility and support material properties significantly impact catalytic performance, underscoring their pivotal role in CO2-ODHP efficiency.

        The performance and behavior of Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly those of the form Fe2O3/AC, in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) have been extensively studied. These catalysts demonstrate enhanced performance through improved reducibility and optimized support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is pivotal in the reaction mechanism, driving the dehydrogenation process efficiently. Catalyst reducibility and the synergy between the catalyst and support material, such as activated carbon (AC), significantly influence catalytic activity.

        The superior activity of Fe2O3/AC is attributed to ceria's (CeO2) oxygen storage capacity, enabling CO2 dissociation into CO and active oxygen species that migrate to the Fe oxide surface, maintaining high reactivity. Zirconia (ZrO2) increases ceria's activity, facilitating CO2 activation and palladium-ceria phase cooperation, which enhances the catalyst's efficiency. DRIFTS experiments further confirm the ceria-zirconia material's role in reoxidizing itself through CO2 dissociation post-reducing treatment, accelerating the catalyst's recovery of activity.

        In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, excel in CO2-ODHP, showing enhanced performance and reducibility compared to other catalysts.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.12.024\], \[10.1021/jp807864z\], \[10.1007/s11144-008-5339-x\], \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\], \[10.1021/ja070908q\], \[10.1007/BF00805576\], and \[10.1021/acscatal.5b01519\]. The performance, reducibility, and reaction mechanisms of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) are profoundly influenced by the nature of the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a central role in catalysis, facilitating the dehydrogenation process through the interaction with CO2 molecules. Catalyst reducibility is a critical determinant of activity, as demonstrated by the studies.

            The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane hinges on their reducibility and support materials, notably Fe2O3/AC, which exhibit high activity due to synergistic effects. Extensive research highlights the pivotal role of Fe oxide-based catalysts in this process, underscoring the impact of reducibility and support materials on catalytic outcomes. As noted in reference \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.12.024\], the influence of CO2 on catalytic activity is not solely due to carbonate formation but rather the ability of ceria-zirconia supports to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to palladium for reoxidation, enhancing activity. 

            The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving Fe(II) reduction to Fe(III) and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III), facilitates the reaction mechanism, enabling dehydrogenation through interaction with CO2 molecules. As stated in reference \[10.1021/jp807864z\], the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by their reducibility, and Fe2O3/AC outperforms other catalysts due to the synergistic effect of the support material. This synergy enhances the catalytic activity by improving the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and CO2 molecules.

            The study in reference \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\] emphasizes the importance of Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly Fe2O3/AC, in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, highlighting the role of reducibility and support materials in catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism, involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide, underscores the mechanism by which these catalysts operate.

            In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts, especially when supported on Fe2O3/AC, demonstrate superior performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane due to their enhanced reducibility and the synergistic effects of the support material. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the catalytic process, enabling efficient dehydrogenation of propane through interaction with CO2 molecules. These findings collectively elucidate the role of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP, highlighting the importance of support materials and the redox cycle of Fe oxide in catalytic performance.

            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the optimization of Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly those incorporating Fe2O3/AC, to enhance their performance in CO2-ODHP. The development of new catalysts with tailored properties could lead to more efficient processes for the production of valuable chemicals from propane. Additionally, exploring the integration of renewable energy sources to drive CO2 utilization in such processes could significantly contribute to sustainable chemical synthesis. The synergy between catalysis and renewable energy technologies holds promise for the development of green chemical production routes that address environmental concerns while providing economic benefits.
