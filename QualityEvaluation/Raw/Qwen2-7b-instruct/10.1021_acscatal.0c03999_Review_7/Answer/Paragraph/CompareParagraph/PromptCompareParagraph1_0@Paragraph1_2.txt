Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, have been thoroughly analyzed for their effectiveness in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Their superior activity is attributed to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity, and the interaction between Fe oxide catalysts and CO2 molecules facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is reduced to Fe(III) during the reaction. This redox cycle is facilitated by the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and CO2 molecules, leading to the dehydrogenation of propane. The reducibility of the Fe oxide was found to significantly influence its catalytic activity, and Fe2O3/AC showed enhanced catalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of the support material.

The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst. The alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures. The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity.

Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation.

The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less).

In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, significantly enhance CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, characterized by Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III), is pivotal in the process. Catalyst reducibility and support material properties significantly impact catalytic performance, underscoring their pivotal role in CO2-ODHP efficiency.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies.

Additionally, the integration of CO2 capture and storage technologies with CO2-ODHP processes could lead to more environmentally friendly and economically viable industrial applications.

            Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on developing more efficient catalysts that can operate under mild conditions, exploring the synergistic effects of multiple metal oxides in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation processes, and investigating the role of various support materials beyond activated carbon to enhance catalytic activity. Moreover, the integration of computational methods with experimental studies could provide deeper insights into the reaction mechanisms and catalyst design, enabling the creation of catalysts with tailored properties for optimal CO2-ODHP performance. Additionally, the development of in-situ monitoring techniques for real-time assessment of catalyst performance and activity degradation could lead to the implementation of self-regulating systems capable of maintaining high efficiency over extended periods.
