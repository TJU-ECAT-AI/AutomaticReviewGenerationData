Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, have been thoroughly analyzed for their effectiveness in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Their superior activity is attributed to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity, and the interaction between Fe oxide catalysts and CO2 molecules facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is reduced to Fe(III) during the reaction. This redox cycle is facilitated by the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and CO2 molecules, leading to the dehydrogenation of propane. The reducibility of the Fe oxide was found to significantly influence its catalytic activity, and Fe2O3/AC showed enhanced catalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of the support material.

The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst. The alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures. The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity.

Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation.

The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less).

In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, significantly enhance CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, characterized by Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III), is pivotal in the process. Catalyst reducibility and support material properties significantly impact catalytic performance, underscoring their pivotal role in CO2-ODHP efficiency.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能得到了彻底的分析。它们的优越活性归因于它们的高可还原性和支持材料的协同作用。Fe氧化物的红ox循环在增强催化活性方面起着关键作用，并且Fe氧化物催化剂与CO2分子之间的相互作用促进了丙烷的脱氢。这些催化剂的性能受到可还原性和支持材料的显著影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC配置中的作用。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的红ox循环，在反应过程中Fe(II)被还原为Fe(III)。这种红ox循环通过Fe氧化物催化剂与CO2分子的相互作用促进丙烷的脱氢。Fe氧化物的可还原性对催化剂活性有显著影响，而Fe2O3/AC由于支持材料的协同效应表现出增强的催化性能。

研究结果表明，CO2在甲烷催化燃烧中并非惰性，其影响实际上取决于催化剂的支持类型：铝基钯催化剂受CO2抑制，但如果使用氧化铈或更进一步的氧化铈-氧化锆作为钯活性相的支持材料，CO2可以促进反应，即使在较低温度下也是如此。Pd/Ce-Zr-O在CO2存在下的活动性改进是由于氧化铈-氧化锆材料能够将一些CO2分解为CO和活性氧物种，这些物种迁移到钯相以保持钯处于高度氧化状态，从而提高活性的结果。

氧化铈在CO2激活过程中扮演主要角色，因为它具有氧储存能力特性：Ce3+位点负责激活CO2。然而，氧化锆是必要的（i）增加氧化铈支持钯催化剂在常规操作条件下的活性，（ii）使氧化铈材料能够利用CO2进料中的某些CO2，允许其激活。氧化铈-氧化锆之间Pd的合作也是CO2激活所必需的。因此，可以在Pd/Ce0.21Zr0.79O2催化剂中观察到CO2进料中存在的激活效果，因为（i）存在减少中心（Ce3+），并且（ii）存在一些钯以允许相合作。

低BE O1s/O1s比率可以作为氧化铈整体氧化状态的相应指标：完全氧化的氧化铈（CeO2）给出大约70%的比例，而主要基于Ce(III)的化合物则具有更低的比例（15%或更少）。

总之，Fe氧化物基催化剂，尤其是Fe2O3/AC，显著增强了CO2辅助下丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的过程，这得益于它们的高可还原性和支持材料的协同作用。Fe氧化物的红ox循环，通过Fe(III)还原至Fe(II)并随后氧化回Fe(III)，在该过程中至关重要。可还原性和支持材料属性对催化性能的影响显著，强调了它们在CO2-ODHP效率中的关键作用。
