In the realm of catalytic chemistry, the utilization of iron oxide-based catalysts in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has garnered significant attention for its potential in sustainable chemical processes. This technique involves the conversion of propane into valuable hydrocarbons using oxygen and carbon dioxide as reactants, facilitated by a catalyst. The performance of these catalysts is notably influenced by their composition and support materials, with a particular focus on the Fe2O3/AC system demonstrating exceptional activity.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, when supported on activated carbon (AC), exhibit superior performance due to the synergistic effects between the metal oxide and the carbon support. The support material plays a crucial role in enhancing the dispersion of active metal sites, improving the stability of the catalyst, and facilitating mass transport of reactants and products. In the case of Fe2O3/AC, the high surface area of the AC provides ample sites for adsorption and desorption of reactants and products, while the iron oxide particles are well dispersed, ensuring efficient contact and reaction rates.

The reaction mechanisms underlying the CO2-ODHP process are complex but can be generally described as follows: Propane molecules adsorb onto the catalyst surface, followed by the sequential addition of oxygen and carbon dioxide, leading to the formation of intermediate species that undergo dehydrogenative reactions to produce hydrocarbons. The presence of CO2 is critical as it not only acts as a reactant but also aids in the stabilization of the catalyst under the high-temperature conditions required for the dehydrogenation process. The Fe2O3 component is particularly adept at promoting these reactions due to its ability to facilitate the adsorption and activation of both oxygen and carbon dioxide, thus accelerating the overall conversion efficiency.

Moreover, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst system benefits from enhanced thermal stability and resistance to sintering compared to unsupported Fe2O3, making it more durable over multiple reaction cycles. This durability, combined with its high activity and selectivity towards desired hydrocarbon products, underscores the significance of Fe2O3/AC as an efficient catalyst for CO2-ODHP, paving the way for more environmentally friendly and economically viable industrial applications.

Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.apcatb.2017.08.052\] and \[10.1016/j.jcat.2015.12.015\]. The Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, have been thoroughly analyzed for their effectiveness in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Their superior activity is attributed to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing catalytic activity, and the interaction between Fe oxide catalysts and CO2 molecules facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane. The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is reduced to Fe(III) during the reaction. This redox cycle is facilitated by the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and CO2 molecules, leading to the dehydrogenation of propane. The reducibility of the Fe oxide was found to significantly influence its catalytic activity, and Fe2O3/AC showed enhanced catalytic performance due to the synergistic effect of the support material.

The results of this study show that CO2 is not inert during catalytic combustion of methane and that its influence actually depends on the type of support of the catalyst. The alumina-supported palladium catalyst is inhibited by CO2, but if ceria and, even more, ceria-zirconia is used as supporting material for the palladium active phase, CO2 can promote the reaction, even at moderate temperatures. The activity improvement of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O in presence of CO2 would be the consequence of the ability of ceria-zirconia material to dissociate some CO2 to CO and active oxygen species, which migrate towards the palladium phase in order to maintain palladium in a highly oxidized state, improving activity.

Ceria plays the main role in the activating process of CO2, due to its oxygen storage capacity character: the Ce3+ sites would be responsible for the activation of CO2. However, zirconia is necessary (i) to increase the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts in conventional operating conditions, and (ii) to allow the ceria material to take advantage of the presence of some CO2 in the feed, allowing its activation. Phase cooperation between palladium and ceria is also necessary for CO2 activation. Thus, an activating effect of the presence of CO2 in the feed can be observed on the Pd/ Ce0.21Zr0.79O2 catalyst, since (i) reduced centers (Ce3+) are present, and (ii) some palladium is present to allow phase cooperation.

The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio can be used as a relevant indicator of the overall oxidation state of ceria: fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) gives a ratio of about 70%, whereas compounds mainly based on Ce(III) are characterized by a much lower ratio (15% or less).

In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts, notably Fe2O3/AC, significantly enhance CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) due to their high reducibility and the synergistic role of support materials. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, characterized by Fe(III) reduction to Fe(II) and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III), is pivotal in the process. Catalyst reducibility and support material properties significantly impact catalytic performance, underscoring their pivotal role in CO2-ODHP efficiency.



Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Taking into consideration the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on the development of new catalyst materials with enhanced CO2 utilization, optimization of reaction conditions to achieve higher selectivity and yield, and the integration of CO2-ODHP processes into sustainable energy systems. The exploration of alternative support materials with enhanced stability and activity, as well as the development of novel reaction mechanisms that could further enhance the efficiency of CO2-ODHP processes, presents a promising avenue for future research. Additionally, the integration of CO2 capture and storage technologies with CO2-ODHP processes could lead to more environmentally friendly and economically viable industrial applications.
