          [1] "As shown in fig. 1 methane interacts with Mo2C at 973 K."
          [2] "The reaction starts with a maximum rate, the con- version is, however, very low (0.16%), which further decreases in time."
          [3] "The main gaseous product is H2."
          [4] "Ethane is formed only in a very small amount."
          [5] "Exposing the catalyst, free of contamination of non- carbidic carbon, to methane flow at 973 K, we obtained somewhat higher initial activity, but the general behav- ior remained the same (fig. 1)."
          [6] "One possible reason for the low reactivity of Mo2C is that during its preparation excess carbon was deposited on the surface of Mo2C, which poisoned its surface."
          [7] "In the next experiment the catalytic performance of Mo2C mixed with ZSM-5 was examined."
          [8] "It is known that ZSM-5 is a very active catalyst in the oligomerization and aromatization of ethylene [17,18]."
          [9] "The absence of a larger production of hydrocarbons suggests that methane decomposes completely to carbon."
          [10] "The fact that CO was also identified among the prod- ucts suggests that the carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 was not complete during the preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5."
          [11] "To overcome this problem, MOEC was produced by the carburization of 2% MoO3/ZSM-5 following the method of Lee et al. [14] (fig. 2)."
          [12] "In this case we experi- enced a dramatic change in the conversion of methane and also in the product distribution."
          [13] "The induction period is practically missing; the reaction starts with the highest rate."
          [14] "Although a decay in the con- version occurs in this case too, the conversion at the steady state is higher (5-6%) compared to that obtained for 2 wt% MoO3/ZSM-5 under the same conditions [11,12]."
          [15] "The selectivity to benzene is also higher, N 85.0%, on Mo2C/ZSM-50 and remained constant after 30 rain."
          [16] "In order to explore the influence of molybdenum oxi- des, in the subsequent experiments we examined the effect of the oxidation of 2 wt% Mo2C (Aldrich) mixed with ZSM-5 support."
          [17] "Based on this finding, the oxidation of Mo2C was performed in situ to different extents and the catalytic behavior of the solid so formed was tested."
          [18] "Note that this sample exhibited very little activity towards methane decomposition before the oxidation (fig. 1)."
          [19] "As we wanted to explore the product formation in the initial phase of the interaction of methane with the partially oxidized catalyst, the methane flow through the catalyst bed was stopped dur- ing the analysis of outlet gases."
          [20] "In fig. 3 are plotted the conversion of methane and the rate of benzene formation allowing the oxidation of 1.4 wt% Mo2C/ZSM-5 to different extents."
          [21] "The conversion of methane started with a maximum value on the sample oxidized to 15%."
          [22] "Following a more extensive oxidation,the development of a more active catalyst required a longer contact of CH4 with the catalyst."
          [23] "This feature was also exhibited in the rate of benzene formation."
          [24] "The initial rate was high on the Mo2C oxidized to 15%."
          [25] "A much lower rate (0.1 #mol at 2.5 min and 2.65 #tool at 4 min) was measured on the catalyst oxidized to 50%,although the conversion of methane was 8% in the latter case."

          The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not discussed in the provided literature. The focus is on the conversion of methane to benzene over Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts. There is no mention of Fe oxide-based catalysts, their reducibility, or the influence of support materials like activated carbon (AC) in the context of CO2-ODHP.

          在提供的文献中，没有提到Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷的脱氢氧化（CO2-ODHP）的性能。讨论的重点是甲烷在Mo2C和Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上的转化。没有提及Fe氧化物基催化剂、其可还原性或支持材料如活性炭（AC）在CO2-ODHP中的影响。
