The improvement in activity of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to the palladium phase to maintain it in a highly oxidized state, enhancing activity.\n          \n          4. Ceria plays the central role in the activation process of CO2, thanks to its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia increases the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts and allows ceria to utilize CO2, enhancing its activation.\n          \n          5. Cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation. The ceria-zirconia catalyst exhibits an activating effect of CO2, as ceria provides reduced centers and palladium facilitates phase cooperation.\n          \n          6. DRIFTS experiments reveal that the ceria-zirconia material uses surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, to reoxidize itself after a reducing treatment, resulting in faster recovery of the catalyst's activity compared to using He. Oxygen migration is much faster under O2 than CO2 at 300Â°C.\n          \n          7. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a reliable indicator of ceria's overall oxidation state. Fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) yields a ratio around 70%, while compounds predominantly based on Ce(III) exhibit a much lower ratio.", "Doi": "10.1016/j.apcatb.2005.12.024"},
