The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Fe2O3/AC shows high catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect between the Fe oxide and the activated carbon support. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed as the reaction mechanism, which enables the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

1. For solid catalysts containing vanadium as an active component, excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene has been reported, where CO2 acts as an oxidant and no steam is involved.
          2. Other studies have shown that the enhancement of ethylbenzene dehydrogenation activity is significant with CO2 when using Fe2O3/Al2O3, MnO2ZrO2, and a SBA-15-supported CeO2ZrO2 catalyst.
          3. In the presence of CO2, coke deposition can be effectively eliminated through oxidation with CO2.
          4. Without CO2, the polymerized polystyrene turns into graphite-like coke at temperatures above 500°C, resulting in catalyst inactivation.

Fe oxide-based catalysts have been thoroughly analyzed for their effectiveness in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP).

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not discussed in the provided literature. The focus is on the conversion of methane to benzene over Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts. There is no mention of Fe oxide-based catalysts, their reducibility, or the influence of support materials like activated carbon (AC) in the context of CO2-ODHP.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic process, which involves the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III).

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP):

          1. The influence of CO2 on the catalytic combustion of methane depends on the type of support of the catalyst. Alumina-supported palladium catalysts are inhibited by CO2, whereas ceria and ceria-zirconia supported catalysts can promote the reaction even at moderate temperatures.
          
          2. Carbonates formation is not a valid explanation for CO2's influence on the catalytic combustion of methane. Carbonates observed on alumina-supported catalysts are unstable above 300°C, unlike those on ceria-zirconia-supported catalysts.
          
          3. The improvement in activity of the Pd/Ce-Zr-O catalyst in the presence of CO2 is due to the ceria-zirconia material's ability to dissociate CO2 into CO and active oxygen species, which migrate to the palladium phase to maintain it in a highly oxidized state, enhancing activity.
          
          4. Ceria plays the central role in the activation process of CO2, thanks to its oxygen storage capacity. Zirconia increases the activity of ceria-supported palladium catalysts and allows ceria to utilize CO2, enhancing its activation.
          
          5. Cooperation between palladium and ceria is essential for CO2 activation. The ceria-zirconia catalyst exhibits an activating effect of CO2, as ceria provides reduced centers and palladium facilitates phase cooperation.
          
          6. DRIFTS experiments reveal that the ceria-zirconia material uses surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, to reoxidize itself after a reducing treatment, resulting in faster recovery of the catalyst's activity compared to using He. Oxygen migration is much faster under O2 than CO2 at 300°C.
          
          7. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a reliable indicator of ceria's overall oxidation state. Fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) yields a ratio around 70%, while compounds predominantly based on Ce(III) exhibit a much lower ratio.

The synthesis of ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions with crystalline walls was carried out. The reducibility of the catalyst and the support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity.

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature highlights the critical role of catalyst reducibility and support materials, specifically in the context of Fe2O3/AC. The study proposes a redox cycle of Fe oxide as the underlying reaction mechanism.

The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness method. The relaxation to a steady-state reflects changes in the chemical or phase composition of the catalyst surface due to reaction conditions, known as extrinsic relaxation. The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) significantly impacts the catalyst and the propane-to-propylene conversion reaction. Carbon dioxide (CO2), as the oxidant, only oxidizes to V2O4 and cannot fully restore the catalyst to its original V2O5 state. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation increases propylene production selectivity and reduces carbon formation. Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, as supported by isotopic experiments and DFT calculations.

DRIFTS experiments reveal that the ceria-zirconia material uses surrounding CO2, via its dissociation, to reoxidize itself after a reducing treatment, resulting in faster recovery of the catalyst's activity compared to using He. Oxygen migration is much faster under O2 than CO2 at 300°C.
          
          7. The Low BE O1s/O1s ratio serves as a reliable indicator of ceria's overall oxidation state. Fully oxidized ceria (CeO2) yields a ratio around 70%, while compounds predominantly based on Ce(III) exhibit a much lower ratio.

The synthesis of ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions with crystalline walls was carried out. The reducibility of the catalyst and the support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is involved in the proposed reaction mechanism. This study analyzed the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP).

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature highlights the critical role of catalyst reducibility and support materials, specifically in the context of Fe2O3/AC. The study proposes a redox cycle of Fe oxide as the underlying reaction mechanism.

The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness method. The relaxation to a steady-state reflects changes in the chemical or phase composition of the catalyst surface due to reaction conditions, known as extrinsic relaxation. The addition of tungsten oxide (WOx) significantly impacts the catalyst and the propane-to-propylene conversion reaction. Carbon dioxide (CO2), as the oxidant, only oxidizes to V2O4 and cannot fully restore the catalyst to its original V2O5 state. CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation increases propylene production selectivity and reduces carbon formation. Propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 can occur through both direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction, as supported by isotopic experiments and DFT calculations.
