3. In the absence of CO2, the dehydrogenation reaction still occurred, producing less styrene. This implies that the direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene takes place over the HSA-CeO2 catalyst; however, both ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield were enhanced by adding CO2.
          4. In the presence of CO2, coke deposition can be effectively eliminated through oxidation with CO2.
          5. It has been suggested that ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 might follow two pathways: a one-step and a two-step route.
          6. We discovered that high-surface-area ceria, synthesized via a template-assisted method, shows higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield at low temperatures (400-500°C) compared to commercial ceria nanoparticles.
          7. Ethylbenzene initially dehydrogenated to styrene and H2, and subsequently, the H2 could react either with lattice O or CO2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.

Support materials, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC, are essential for improving the catalytic efficiency.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. In particular, the use of Fe2O3/AC supports shows significant effects on catalytic activity due to their role in the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is proposed to be involved in the reaction mechanism.

Vanadium oxide is recognized as a key component in metal oxide catalysis. Enhancements in yield can be achieved by incorporating WOx. The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane over WOxVOx/SiO2 involves oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4 and participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. CO2 also helps in suppressing the formation of surface carbon. A partially reduced vanadia dimer was utilized as the active site for DFT calculations. The DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile at 600°C reveals that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) acts as a rate-limiting step, whereas the re-oxidation of the catalyst with CO2 could occur much faster.
