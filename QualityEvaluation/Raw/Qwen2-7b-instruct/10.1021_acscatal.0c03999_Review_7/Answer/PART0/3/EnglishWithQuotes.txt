In the absence of CO2, the dehydrogenation reaction still occurred, producing less styrene. This implies that the direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene takes place over the HSA-CeO2 catalyst; however, both ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield were enhanced by adding CO2.\n          4. In the presence of CO2, coke deposition can be effectively eliminated through oxidation with CO2.\n          5. It has been suggested that ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 might follow two pathways: a one-step and a two-step route.\n          6. We discovered that high-surface-area ceria, synthesized via a template-assisted method, shows higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield at low temperatures (400-500°C) compared to commercial ceria nanoparticles.\n          7. Ethylbenzene initially dehydrogenated to styrene and H2, and subsequently, the H2 could react either with lattice O or CO2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction.", "Doi": "10.1021/acscatal.5b01519"},
