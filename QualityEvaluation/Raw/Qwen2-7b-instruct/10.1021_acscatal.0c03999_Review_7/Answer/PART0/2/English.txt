The research aimed to examine the periodic density functional theory regarding propane dehydrogenation on a perfect Ga2O3(100) surface. The study focused on evaluating the performance of iron oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The researchers emphasized the effect of catalyst reducibility and the role of support materials, specifically in the context of Fe2O3/AC, on the catalytic activity. A suggested reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of iron oxide was outlined, which elucidates the contribution of these elements in enhancing the catalytic process.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is significantly influenced by their reducibility and support materials. In particular, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst shows enhanced activity due to its unique structure and composition. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the proposed reaction mechanism, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has been analyzed. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, especially in the context of Fe2O3/AC, significantly influence catalytic activity. A redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed as a key component of the reaction mechanism involved in this process.

The catalyst characterization through H2-TPR, CO2-TPO, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy indicates that the combination of metals enables the retention of VOx dispersion during the reaction. CO2 can oxidize V2O3 to V2O4 and is involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. When D2 is present in the feed with C3H8 and CO2 (D2:C3H8:CO2 = 1:1:1), only 45% of the generated water contains D2O, suggesting simultaneous oxidative dehydrogenation and reverse water gas shift reactions. CO2 helps suppress the formation of surface carbon. DFT calculations using a partially reduced vanadia dimer as the active site confirmed that propane dehydrogenation with CO2 can occur concurrently through direct oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water gas shift reaction. The catalyst with a W/V ratio of 0.1 M has the highest average C3H6 turnover frequency, but higher selectivities were achieved with a W/V ratio of 0.6. At 600°C, the DFT-calculated Gibbs free energy profile shows that the activation of the secondary CAH bond of propane (EDFT,act = 158 kJ/mol) is rate-limiting, whereas catalyst re-oxidation with CO2 could occur much faster.
