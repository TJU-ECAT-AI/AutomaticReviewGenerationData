[1] "Several types of chromium species, including monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide, have been reported to exist on these samples."
[2] "It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chromate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method."
[3] "The two kinds of samples exhibit similar catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide."
[4] "The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion."
[5] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."
[6] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."

1. Various types of chromium species, such as monochromates, polychromates, and aggregated chromium oxides, are found on the catalyst samples. 

2. By the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method, monochromate species predominantly exist on the Cr-MCM-41, whereas several chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist when using the template-ion exchange (TIE) method.

3. Both types of Cr-MCM-41 samples demonstrate comparable catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane using carbon dioxide.

4. The yield of propylene exceeds 90% and the use of carbon dioxide boosts propane conversion.

5. In contrast, the sample prepared by the DHT method shows significantly higher selectivity for formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen compared to the TIE method.

6. During methane oxidation, the structure of the chromate species remains intact. The superior dispersion of monochromate species likely explains the higher selectivity observed in the DHT method.

1. 这些催化剂样品中发现了多种类型的铬物种，包括单铬酸盐、多铬酸盐和聚合铬氧化物。

2. 直接水热合成（DHT）方法下，Cr-MCM-41主要含有单铬酸盐物种，而模板离子交换（TIE）方法下的样品则同时存在多种铬酸盐物种，包括单铬酸盐和多铬酸盐。

3. DHT法和TIE法制备的两种Cr-MCM-41样品在丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应中展现出相似的催化性能。

4. 丙烯的产率超过90%，且二氧化碳的存在提高了丙烷转化率。

5. 相比于TIE方法，通过DHT方法制备的样品在甲烷与氧气的部分氧化反应中对甲醛的选择性显著更高。

6. 在甲烷氧化过程中，铬酸盐物种的结构保持不变。单铬酸盐物种的高分散度可能解释了DHT方法下更高的选择性。
