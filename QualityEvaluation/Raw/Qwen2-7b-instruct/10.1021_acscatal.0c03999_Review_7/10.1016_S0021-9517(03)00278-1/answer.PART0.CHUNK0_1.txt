<p>There exist several studies on the syntheses and characterizations of Cr-MCM-41 [1621]. For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide [21] or hydrogen peroxide [22], but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials [2325]. Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieves (Cr-HMS) were reported to exhibit high photocatalytic reactivity in ethylene polymer- ization [26]. Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5% [20]. Recently, a SBA- 15-supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and showed good catalytic performance [27].</p>
<p>The oxidation state of chromium and the coordination structure of chromium species over supported chromium oxides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been inves- tigated by various techniques such as ESR [28], UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [29], XPS [30], XANES [21,31], and TPR [32]. Several types of chromium species,e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chrom- ium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and the support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The catalyst reducibility allows for the redox cycle of Fe oxide to occur efficiently, enhancing the conversion of propane and the selectivity towards propylene. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), plays a crucial role in maintaining the dispersion of the Fe oxide, which is essential for optimal catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) upon reaction with oxygen, followed by reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) with the release of hydrogen. This cycle facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, converting it into propylene with the assistance of CO2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。催化剂的可还原性使Fe氧化物的还原循环发生得更有效，从而提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），在维持Fe氧化物的分散方面起着关键作用，这对于最佳催化活性至关重要。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，在氧气作用下Fe(II)被氧化为Fe(III)，随后Fe(III)在二氧化碳的帮助下被还原为Fe(II)，释放出氢气。这个循环促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢，将其转化为丙烯，同时利用二氧化碳作为助剂。
