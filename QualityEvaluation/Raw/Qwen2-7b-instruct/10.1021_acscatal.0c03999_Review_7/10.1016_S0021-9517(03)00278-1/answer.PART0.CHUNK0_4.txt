The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was not directly addressed in the literature. However, it can be inferred that the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play crucial roles in influencing the catalytic activity. The literature suggests that the structure-property relationships for Cr-MCM-41 samples prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods are being studied for their catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen. The literature does not provide details on a specific reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide as requested.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能没有直接在文献中讨论。然而，可以推断出Fe氧化物的可还原性和支持材料的性质，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中，对催化活性有着重要影响。文献表明，正在研究由直接水热合成（DHT）和模板离子交换（TIE）方法制备的Cr-MCM-41样品在丙烷脱氢和甲烷部分氧化过程中的催化特性。文献没有提供关于涉及Fe氧化物的特定反应机制的详细信息。
