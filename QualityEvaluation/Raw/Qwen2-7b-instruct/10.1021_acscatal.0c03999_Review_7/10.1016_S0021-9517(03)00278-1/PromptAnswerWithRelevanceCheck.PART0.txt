[1] "Studies of chromium species introduced into MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, would thus be useful in developing Cr-containing catalysts with desirable catalytic properties."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5% [20]."
[3] "Recently, a SBA-15-supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and showed good catalytic performance [27]."
[4] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
[5] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides [33], such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."

An analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals that catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, significantly impact catalytic activity. Reducible Fe oxides facilitate the redox cycle, enhancing the conversion of propane. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), provides a stable structure for the Fe oxide catalyst, allowing for better dispersion and accessibility of reactants. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) upon reaction with CO2, forming a reactive intermediate capable of dehydrogenating propane. The enhanced reducibility and dispersion of Fe2O3 on AC support contribute to improved CO2-ODHP performance, leading to higher propylene yields and selectivities.

<p>There exist several studies on the syntheses and characterizations of Cr-MCM-41 [1621]. For catalytic reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide [21] or hydrogen peroxide [22], but the leaching of chromium to the liquid phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro- porous and mesoporous materials [2325]. Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieves (Cr-HMS) were reported to exhibit high photocatalytic reactivity in ethylene polymer- ization [26]. Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5% [20]. Recently, a SBA- 15-supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and showed good catalytic performance [27].</p>
<p>The oxidation state of chromium and the coordination structure of chromium species over supported chromium oxides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been inves- tigated by various techniques such as ESR [28], UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [29], XPS [30], XANES [21,31], and TPR [32]. Several types of chromium species,e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chrom- ium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and the support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The catalyst reducibility allows for the redox cycle of Fe oxide to occur efficiently, enhancing the conversion of propane and the selectivity towards propylene. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), plays a crucial role in maintaining the dispersion of the Fe oxide, which is essential for optimal catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) upon reaction with oxygen, followed by reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) with the release of hydrogen. This cycle facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, converting it into propylene with the assistance of CO2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。催化剂的可还原性使Fe氧化物的还原循环发生得更有效，从而提高丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），在维持Fe氧化物的分散方面起着关键作用，这对于最佳催化活性至关重要。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，在氧气作用下Fe(II)被氧化为Fe(III)，随后Fe(III)在二氧化碳的帮助下被还原为Fe(II)，释放出氢气。这个循环促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢，将其转化为丙烯，同时利用二氧化碳作为助剂。

1. Various types of chromium species, such as monochromates, polychromates, and aggregated chromium oxides, are found on the catalyst samples. 

2. By the direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) method, monochromate species predominantly exist on the Cr-MCM-41, whereas several chromate species, including both monochromates and polychromates, coexist when using the template-ion exchange (TIE) method.

3. Both types of Cr-MCM-41 samples demonstrate comparable catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane using carbon dioxide.

4. The yield of propylene exceeds 90% and the use of carbon dioxide boosts propane conversion.

5. In contrast, the sample prepared by the DHT method shows significantly higher selectivity for formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen compared to the TIE method.

6. During methane oxidation, the structure of the chromate species remains intact. The superior dispersion of monochromate species likely explains the higher selectivity observed in the DHT method.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves a complex interplay between catalyst reducibility and the specific characteristics of the support material, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the activity of the catalyst. In the presence of CO2, the Fe(III) centers undergo reduction to Fe(II), which then oxidizes the CO2 to CO, releasing hydrogen. This hydrogen is then used in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The support material, AC (activated carbon), provides a surface for the Fe oxide particles, influencing the dispersion and accessibility of the active sites. High dispersion of Fe oxide on the AC support is critical for efficient CO2-ODHP, as it increases the surface area available for the redox reactions and enhances the contact between the reactants and the active sites. The stability and reducibility of the Fe oxide, along with the porosity and surface area of the AC support, are key factors determining the overall catalytic activity in this process.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及催化剂可逆性和特定支撑材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）之间的复杂相互作用。铁氧化物的还原循环在活性催化剂中起着关键作用。在CO2的存在下，Fe(III)中心被还原为Fe(II)，然后氧化CO2生成CO，释放出氢。这些氢随后用于丙烷的脱氢生产丙烯。AC（活性炭）作为支撑材料，为Fe氧化物颗粒提供表面，影响了活性位点的分散性和可接近性。AC支持物上的Fe氧化物的高度分散是该过程高效性的关键，因为它增加了可用于红ox反应的表面积，并增强了反应物与活性位点的接触。Fe氧化物的稳定性和可逆性，以及AC支持物的孔隙率和表面积，是决定整体催化活性的关键因素。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was not directly addressed in the literature. However, it can be inferred that the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play crucial roles in influencing the catalytic activity. The literature suggests that the structure-property relationships for Cr-MCM-41 samples prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods are being studied for their catalytic properties in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen. The literature does not provide details on a specific reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide as requested.
