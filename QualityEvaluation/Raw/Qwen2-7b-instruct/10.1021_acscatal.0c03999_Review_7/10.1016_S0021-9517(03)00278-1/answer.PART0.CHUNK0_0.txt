[1] "Studies of chromium species introduced into MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, would thus be useful in developing Cr-containing catalysts with desirable catalytic properties."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5% [20]."
[3] "Recently, a SBA-15-supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and showed good catalytic performance [27]."
[4] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
[5] "Although there are many studies on the correlation between catalytic properties and coordination structures of the supported chromium oxides [33], such structure-property relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of reactions."

An analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals that catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, significantly impact catalytic activity. Reducible Fe oxides facilitate the redox cycle, enhancing the conversion of propane. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), provides a stable structure for the Fe oxide catalyst, allowing for better dispersion and accessibility of reactants. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) upon reaction with CO2, forming a reactive intermediate capable of dehydrogenating propane. The enhanced reducibility and dispersion of Fe2O3 on AC support contribute to improved CO2-ODHP performance, leading to higher propylene yields and selectivities.

对Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的分析表明，催化剂的可还原性和支持材料，特别是Fe2O3/AC，对催化活性有显著影响。可还原的Fe氧化物促进红ox循环，增强丙烷的转化率。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），为Fe氧化物催化剂提供稳定的结构，有利于催化剂的分散和反应物的接触。提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的红ox循环，在与CO2反应时Fe(II)被氧化为Fe(III)，形成一个可反应的中间体，能够脱氢丙烷。Fe2O3在AC支持上的增强可还原性和分散性导致CO2-ODHP性能的改善，从而获得更高的丙烯产率和选择性。
