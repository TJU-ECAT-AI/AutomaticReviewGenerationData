[1] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), diffuse reflectance UVvis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements."
[3] "The structure of the chromate species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity over the sample by the DHT method."
[4] "On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves a complex interplay between catalyst reducibility and the specific characteristics of the support material, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the activity of the catalyst. In the presence of CO2, the Fe(III) centers undergo reduction to Fe(II), which then oxidizes the CO2 to CO, releasing hydrogen. This hydrogen is then used in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The support material, AC (activated carbon), provides a surface for the Fe oxide particles, influencing the dispersion and accessibility of the active sites. High dispersion of Fe oxide on the AC support is critical for efficient CO2-ODHP, as it increases the surface area available for the redox reactions and enhances the contact between the reactants and the active sites. The stability and reducibility of the Fe oxide, along with the porosity and surface area of the AC support, are key factors determining the overall catalytic activity in this process.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及催化剂可逆性和特定支撑材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）之间的复杂相互作用。铁氧化物的还原循环在活性催化剂中起着关键作用。在CO2的存在下，Fe(III)中心被还原为Fe(II)，然后氧化CO2生成CO，释放出氢。这些氢随后用于丙烷的脱氢生产丙烯。AC（活性炭）作为支撑材料，为Fe氧化物颗粒提供表面，影响了活性位点的分散性和可接近性。AC支持物上的Fe氧化物的高度分散是该过程高效性的关键，因为它增加了可用于红ox反应的表面积，并增强了反应物与活性位点的接触。Fe氧化物的稳定性和可逆性，以及AC支持物的孔隙率和表面积，是决定整体催化活性的关键因素。
