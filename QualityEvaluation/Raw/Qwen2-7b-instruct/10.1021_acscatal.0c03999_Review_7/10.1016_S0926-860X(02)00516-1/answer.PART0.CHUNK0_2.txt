[1] "In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), the addition of small amounts of CO2 in the gas feed leads to an increase in the conversion of propane and a decrease in the yield and selectivity in propene."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption of CO2 on the surface of NiMoO4 catalysts is suggested to form monoatomic oxygen species (O(a)), which can oxidize reduced molybdenum oxides at temperatures around 400-450 C."
[3] "Under the reaction conditions used in this work, the reduction rate of the surface is not so high, making that the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state which leads to the deterioration of the selectivity of the catalyst."

1. In the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), adding CO2 to the gas feed enhances the conversion of propane but reduces the yield and selectivity of propene.

2. The dissociative adsorption of CO2 on NiMoO4 catalyst surfaces is thought to create monoatomic oxygen species (O(a)). These species can oxidize reduced molybdenum oxides at temperatures around 400-450 degrees Celsius.

3. Under the reaction conditions employed in this study, the rate of surface reduction is relatively low, leading to the stabilization of active sites in a high oxidation state, which negatively impacts catalyst selectivity.

4. Injecting CO2 into the feed stream is suggested as a promising method for further controlling and enhancing catalytic performance.

1. 在丙烷氧化脱氢化（ODP）过程中，向气体流中添加少量二氧化碳可以增加丙烷的转化率，但降低丙烯的产率和选择性。

2. 据推测，在NiMoO4催化剂表面的二氧化碳离解吸附会形成单原子氧（O(a)）。这些物种可以在约400-450摄氏度下氧化还原钼氧化物。

3. 在本研究采用的反应条件下，表面的还原速率相对较低，导致活性位点在高氧化态下稳定，这会损害催化剂的选择性。

4. 将二氧化碳注入进料中被提议为进一步控制和提高催化性能的一种有前景的方法。
