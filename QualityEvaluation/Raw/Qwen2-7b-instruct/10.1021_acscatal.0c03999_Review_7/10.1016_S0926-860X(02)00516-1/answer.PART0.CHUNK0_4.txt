[1] "In the case of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) to propene on NiMoO4 catalysts, in spite of the low reaction temperature range (400480 C), it turns out that CO2 is not inert during the reaction. CO2 behaves as a strong oxidant with respect to the catalyst."
[2] "Under particular conditions it can improve propene formation."
[3] "We suggest that CO2 dissociates during the reaction to CO and an active oxygen species, which is responsible for the oxidizing effect of carbon dioxide."
[4] "This work opens promising perspectives in using CO2 to tune dynamically the oxidation state of working oxide surfaces in their most active and selective configurations for oxidation processes."
[5] "Precisely, in the case of the oxidation of hydrocarbons on Mo-containing oxides (MoO3 and molybdates), high performances are obtained with catalysts having their surfaces maintained in a slightly reduced suboxide state."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalysts and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. High reducibility allows for a more effective adsorption of propane, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), provides a larger surface area, enhancing the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites on the Fe oxide catalyst. This combination of high reducibility and a supportive framework leads to improved catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the Fe oxide is reduced by the adsorbed propane and then oxidized by molecular oxygen or the active oxygen species formed upon the dissociation of CO2, thus promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This dynamic interplay between reduction and oxidation is crucial for the catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP, offering promising opportunities for dynamic control of the oxidation state of the catalyst surfaces for optimized performance in oxidation processes.

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能，催化剂的还原性以及支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）对催化活性有重要影响。高还原性有助于更有效的吸附丙烷，促进氧化脱氢过程。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），提供更大的表面积，增强反应物到达Fe氧化物催化剂活性位点的可达性。这种结合高还原性和支持框架的组合导致CO2-ODHP中改善的催化活性。提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在此过程中，Fe氧化物被吸附的丙烷还原，并由分子氧或CO2分解后形成的活性氧物种氧化，从而促进丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。这种还原和氧化之间的动态相互作用对于催化活性和选择性至关重要，在氧化过程中为优化性能提供了有前景的机会。
