[1] "It is well established that dynamic processes occur at the surface of oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions."
[2] "The new structures are more stable but also less active [4]."
[3] "At the macroscopic level, the dynamic behavior of the oxides at work materializes as structuration and reconstruction of the catalytic sites which lead to modifications with time-on-stream of the catalysts,of the kinetics (oscillations, bistabilities, etc.), and to the emergence of synergetic effects between phases [59]."
[4] "In the case of the oxidation of hydrocarbons on Mo-containing oxides (MoO3 and molybdates), high performances are obtained with catalysts having their surfaces maintained in a slightly reduced suboxide state [11]."
[5] "Under the reaction conditions used in this work, the reduction rate is not so high, making that the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state which leads to the deterioration of the selectivity of the catalyst."

1. It is well established that dynamic processes occur at the surface of oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. New structures become more stable but less active, leading to modifications in catalysts' properties over time. Macroscopically, these dynamic behaviors manifest as restructuring of catalytic sites, affecting catalyst kinetics and causing synergistic effects between phases.

2. High performances are obtained with Mo-containing oxide catalysts, specifically MoO3 and molybdates, when their surfaces are maintained in a slightly reduced suboxide state during the oxidation of hydrocarbons.

3. Under the specific reaction conditions used in this study, the high rate of reduction is not present. As a result, the active sites remain in a high oxidation state, which unfortunately deteriorates the selectivity of the catalyst.

4. The injection of CO2 into the feed stream appears as a promising method for further controlling and enhancing catalytic performances. This is because CO2 can be utilized to tune the oxidation state of catalyst surfaces, potentially leading to improved selectivity and reduced deactivation.

1. 已经证明，在氧化反应中，氧化物催化剂表面发生动态过程。新结构变得更加稳定但活性降低，导致催化剂性能随时间变化。宏观上，这些动态行为表现为催化位点的重构，影响催化剂动力学，并引起相间协同效应。

2. 在Mo含氧化物（MoO3和钼酸盐）的情况下，当表面保持在稍微还原的亚氧化态时，通过氧化烃类可以获得高性能。

3. 在本研究使用的特定反应条件下，还原速率不高。因此，活性位点保持在高氧化状态，这实际上损害了催化剂的选择性。

4. 向进料中注入CO2似乎是一种有前景的方法，用于进一步控制和提高催化性能。因为CO2可以用来调整催化剂表面的氧化状态，可能有助于改善选择性和减少失活。

[1] "In the case of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on NiMoO4 catalysts, in spite of the low reaction temperature range (400480 C), it turns out that CO2 is not inert during the reaction. CO2 behaves as a strong oxidant with respect to the catalyst."
[2] "CO2 clearly promotes the non-selectivity of the catalyst and can inhibit deactivation. Under particular conditions it can improve propene formation."
[3] "Under the reaction conditions used in this work, the reduction rate is not so high, making that the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state which leads to the deterioration of the selectivity of the catalyst."

1. CO2 acts as a strong oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on NiMoO4 catalysts, even at low temperatures (400-480°C). It promotes non-selectivity and can inhibit deactivation of the catalyst. 

2. Under specific conditions, CO2 can enhance propene formation. It stabilizes the active sites in a high oxidation state, which negatively impacts the catalyst's selectivity.

3. At the given reaction conditions, the rate of reduction is not high enough to fully compensate for the reduction induced by the hydrocarbon. This results in the catalyst operating in a less oxidized state, which might further improve selective product formation.

4. Injecting CO2 into the feed stream offers a promising approach for controlling and enhancing catalytic performance. It adjusts the oxidation state of active sites, potentially improving selectivity and mitigating deactivation.

1. 在NiMoO4催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应时，尽管反应温度范围在400-480°C之间，CO2并非惰性物质。它对催化剂表现出强烈的氧化性。

2. 在特定条件下，CO2可以增加丙烯的形成量。它使活性位点在高氧化态下稳定，从而降低催化剂的选择性。

3. 在给定的反应条件下，由于烃类的还原速率不高，无法完全抵消由烃类引起的还原作用。这导致催化剂以较低的氧化态运行，可能进一步提高选择性产物的形成。

4. 将CO2注入进料流中为控制和增强催化性能提供了有前景的方法。它调整了活性位点的氧化状态，有可能改善选择性和减少失活。

In the study of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on NiMoO4 catalysts, it was found that CO2 behaves as a strong oxidant with respect to the catalyst. CO2 helps to maintain the catalytic surface in a high oxidation state under conditions for which NiMoO4 undergoes a reduction. CO2 clearly promotes the non-selectivity of the catalyst and can inhibit deactivation. Under particular conditions, it can improve propene formation. CO2 is able to oxidize propane to propene. We suggest that CO2 dissociates during the reaction to CO and an active oxygen species, which is responsible for the oxidizing effect of carbon dioxide. This work opens promising perspectives in using CO2 to tune dynamically the oxidation state of working oxide surfaces in their most active and selective configurations for oxidation processes.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalysts and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. High reducibility allows for a more effective adsorption of propane, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), provides a larger surface area, enhancing the accessibility of the reactants to the active sites on the Fe oxide catalyst. This combination of high reducibility and a supportive framework leads to improved catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the Fe oxide is reduced by the adsorbed propane and then oxidized by molecular oxygen or the active oxygen species formed upon the dissociation of CO2, thus promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This dynamic interplay between reduction and oxidation is crucial for the catalytic activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP, offering promising opportunities for dynamic control of the oxidation state of the catalyst surfaces for optimized performance in oxidation processes.

对于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能，催化剂的还原性以及支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）对催化活性有重要影响。高还原性有助于更有效的吸附丙烷，促进氧化脱氢过程。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），提供更大的表面积，增强反应物到达Fe氧化物催化剂活性位点的可达性。这种结合高还原性和支持框架的组合导致CO2-ODHP中改善的催化活性。提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在此过程中，Fe氧化物被吸附的丙烷还原，并由分子氧或CO2分解后形成的活性氧物种氧化，从而促进丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢。这种还原和氧化之间的动态相互作用对于催化活性和选择性至关重要，在氧化过程中为优化性能提供了有前景的机会。
