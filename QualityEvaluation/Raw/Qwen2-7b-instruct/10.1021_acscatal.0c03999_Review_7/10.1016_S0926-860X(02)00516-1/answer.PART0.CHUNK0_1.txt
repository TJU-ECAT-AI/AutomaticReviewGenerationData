[1] "In the case of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on NiMoO4 catalysts, in spite of the low reaction temperature range (400480 C), it turns out that CO2 is not inert during the reaction. CO2 behaves as a strong oxidant with respect to the catalyst."
[2] "CO2 clearly promotes the non-selectivity of the catalyst and can inhibit deactivation. Under particular conditions it can improve propene formation."
[3] "Under the reaction conditions used in this work, the reduction rate is not so high, making that the active sites are stabilized in a high oxidation state which leads to the deterioration of the selectivity of the catalyst."
[4] "The injection of CO2 in the feed could thus appear as a promising way for further controlling or improving catalytic performances."

1. CO2 acts as a strong oxidant in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on NiMoO4 catalysts, even at low temperatures (400-480°C). It promotes non-selectivity and can inhibit deactivation of the catalyst. 

2. Under specific conditions, CO2 can enhance propene formation. It stabilizes the active sites in a high oxidation state, which negatively impacts the catalyst's selectivity.

3. At the given reaction conditions, the rate of reduction is not high enough to fully compensate for the reduction induced by the hydrocarbon. This results in the catalyst operating in a less oxidized state, which might further improve selective product formation.

4. Injecting CO2 into the feed stream offers a promising approach for controlling and enhancing catalytic performance. It adjusts the oxidation state of active sites, potentially improving selectivity and mitigating deactivation.

1. 在NiMoO4催化剂上进行丙烷氧化脱氢反应时，尽管反应温度范围在400-480°C之间，CO2并非惰性物质。它对催化剂表现出强烈的氧化性。

2. 在特定条件下，CO2可以增加丙烯的形成量。它使活性位点在高氧化态下稳定，从而降低催化剂的选择性。

3. 在给定的反应条件下，由于烃类的还原速率不高，无法完全抵消由烃类引起的还原作用。这导致催化剂以较低的氧化态运行，可能进一步提高选择性产物的形成。

4. 将CO2注入进料流中为控制和增强催化性能提供了有前景的方法。它调整了活性位点的氧化状态，有可能改善选择性和减少失活。
