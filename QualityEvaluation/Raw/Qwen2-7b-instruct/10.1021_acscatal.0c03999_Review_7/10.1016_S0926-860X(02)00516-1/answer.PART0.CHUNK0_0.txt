1. It is well established that dynamic processes occur at the surface of oxide catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions. New structures become more stable but less active, leading to modifications in catalysts' properties over time. Macroscopically, these dynamic behaviors manifest as restructuring of catalytic sites, affecting catalyst kinetics and causing synergistic effects between phases.

2. High performances are obtained with Mo-containing oxide catalysts, specifically MoO3 and molybdates, when their surfaces are maintained in a slightly reduced suboxide state during the oxidation of hydrocarbons.

3. Under the specific reaction conditions used in this study, the high rate of reduction is not present. As a result, the active sites remain in a high oxidation state, which unfortunately deteriorates the selectivity of the catalyst.

4. The injection of CO2 into the feed stream appears as a promising method for further controlling and enhancing catalytic performances. This is because CO2 can be utilized to tune the oxidation state of catalyst surfaces, potentially leading to improved selectivity and reduced deactivation.

1. 已经证明，在氧化反应中，氧化物催化剂表面发生动态过程。新结构变得更加稳定但活性降低，导致催化剂性能随时间变化。宏观上，这些动态行为表现为催化位点的重构，影响催化剂动力学，并引起相间协同效应。

2. 在Mo含氧化物（MoO3和钼酸盐）的情况下，当表面保持在稍微还原的亚氧化态时，通过氧化烃类可以获得高性能。

3. 在本研究使用的特定反应条件下，还原速率不高。因此，活性位点保持在高氧化状态，这实际上损害了催化剂的选择性。

4. 向进料中注入CO2似乎是一种有前景的方法，用于进一步控制和提高催化性能。因为CO2可以用来调整催化剂表面的氧化状态，可能有助于改善选择性和减少失活。
