1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation of light hydrocarbons has a considerable industrial impact, because it rep- resents a method to obtain unsaturated hydrocarbons from feedstocks of the corresponding paraffins. Nowa- days, the dehydrogenation of propane has become very important. Propene is used in chemical industry for the synthesis of cumene, acrylonitrile and high purity polypropylene.
Dehydrogenation of alkanes is an endothermic pro- cess which requires relatively high temperatures and low pressures to obtain good yield of alkenes. As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective. Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to re- move heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high se- lectivity towards propene. Therefore, it is necessary to develop selective catalysts that can depress the overoxidation, or to explore weak oxidants replacing oxygen in this reaction.
In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon diox- ide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the prob- lem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The at- tractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for com- mercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.
Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hy- drocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with 0926-860X/$  see front matter  2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/S0926-860X(03)00368-5 426

CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6. The key problem is the development of a new catalyst with desirable selec- tivity. Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydro- genation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent per- formance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They re- ported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence.
Ga2O3-based catalysts have been proved to be ac- tive in dehydrogenation or amortisation of light alka- nes [10] and in selective catalytic reduction of NOx by hydrocarbons in the presence of oxygen [11]. It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide cat- alysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8].
In our previous work we reported that gallium ox- ide showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 873 K, giving 30.6% propene yield with selectiv- ity 93.3% [9]. In this work the catalytic performance of gallium oxide catalysts in conversion of propane to propene with CO2 have been examined. The influence of modification of the gallium oxide acidity/basicity properties has also been investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
The bulk Ga2O3 catalyst was obtained by ther- mal decomposition of Ga(NO3)3·9H2O (Fluka AG) at 923 K for 3 h in air. Ga2O3 was impregnated suc- cessively with an aqueous solution of KNO3 (POCh Gliwice) to yield the K/Ga atomic ratios of 0.03 (Ga2O3-K1) and 0.1 (Ga2O3-K2). After the impreg- nation, the catalysts were dried at 423 K for 2 h and calcinated at 923 K for 3 h in air.
Specific surface area of the catalysts was deter- mined by the BET method using Ar as adsorbate at 77 K. Ga2O3 and Ga2O3-K2 catalysts were analysed with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray diffractometre (Philips X-PERT) at room temperature with Cu K radiation (40 kV and 30 mA). The carbon deposit on the Ga2O3 catalyst after reaction in a stream of CO2 and argon was determined by TGA analysis (Universal V2.3C TA). The samples of the catalysts were heated up to 873 K at a rate of 5 K min1 in a stream of air (flow rate, 30 ml min1).
2.2. Catalytic tests
The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 was carried out at atmospheric pres- sure in flow-type stainless steel reactor packed with
0.5 g of the catalyst and 1.5 g of quartz sand (grain
size 0.20.3 mm). The feed was a mixture of 17 vol.% of propane and 83 vol.% of carbon dioxide. The total flow rate was 30 ml/min. The catalysts were first de- gassed in a helium stream at 873 K and then the reac- tion was started at this temperature. The samples for GC analyses were taken after 0.2 and 0.75 h. Blank tests were conducted under the same conditions, by replacing the catalyst with quartz sand particles of the same size.
The reactants and products were analysed on-line using two gas chromatographs. One of them was equipped with a glass column packed with 3 m×3 mm Porapak Q and a flame ionisation detector. It was used to analyse the hydrocarbons (C1C3). The second chromatograph was equipped with a stainless steel column packed with 3 mm × 3 mm Carboxen 1000 and, a thermal conductivity detector (for CO, H2 and CO2 analyses).
The propane conversion and selectivities toward the formation of products were calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2), where ai is the number of carbon atoms in compound i.

427 Si = (ai/3)ni nC3H6 + 2/3nC2H6 + 2/3nC2H4 + 1/3nCH4 × 100 (2) The calculations do not consider the conversion of propane to coke, as its instantaneous formation is time dependent and difficult to estimate. Therefore,the calculations are based on the propane conver- sion to propene, ethane, ethene and methane. Coke deposition was estimated by TGA.
Pulse reaction technique was employed for better understanding of the role of CO2. The pulse was a mixture of 50 vol.% of propane and 50 vol.% of carbon dioxide. The Ga2O3 reducibility was also studied by a pulse method. The samples 0.5 g of Ga2O3 catalysts were degassed at 873 K in stream of helium and re- duced by pulses of hydrogen or propane. The reduced catalysts were then reoxidised at the same conditions,by pulses of carbon dioxide. The impulse volumes of hydrogen, propane and carbon dioxide were the same (0.012 mmol). The reactants and products were anal- ysed as above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Role of carbon dioxide
The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be considered as follows:
CH3CH2CH3 = CH2=CHCH3 + H2
(3)
H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O
(4) As was shown by thermodynamic considerations [13],propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift (4). Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted to- wards products. For example, at 873 K at a molar ra- tio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92%, while in the presence of an in- ert gas only 75% conversion can be achieved under the same condition. It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5,the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas.
The dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Ga2O3 in the presence or absence of carbon diox- ide were investigated under similar conditions. Fig. 1 presents the catalytic performance in both processes as a function of the reaction time. The promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was observed only in the initial state of the reaction.
Under carbon dioxide atmosphere after reaction period
0.2 h, the propene yield reached 30.6%, while under
argon 23.0%.
Rapid deactivation of the catalyst performance was observed in both atmospheres. After 1 h, the propene yield strongly decreased to 6.9% both in the presence or absence of CO2. Such remarkable decreases in the propene yield can be attributed to carbon deposition on the Ga2O3 surface, as suggested in the previous paper [9]. TGA analysis showed 3% increase in the mass of the Ga2O3 catalyst after 4 h reaction period.
These results indicate that in the reaction conditions carbon dioxide does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst. However, as was shown by the pulse reaction (Section 3.5.) the role of CO2 could be to eliminate deposited carbon (reaction 5).
CO2 + C = 2CO
(5) Pulse reaction studies were performed for compar- ing between the initial yield of hydrocarbon products during the reaction in a stream of carbon dioxide or argon. Fig. 2 shows the propane conversion and the yield of hydrocarbon products as a function of pulse number. The propene yield and the total yield of hy- drocarbons (C1C3) in the presence of carbon dioxide are higher than those in argon atmosphere.
This result suggests that the promoting role of carbon dioxide is observed only, when little coke is present on the surface of the Ga2O3 catalyst.
3.2. Influence of the reaction temperature
The effect of the reaction temperature on the dehy- drogenation activity of Ga2O3 catalyst was examined.
Propene yield and selectivity as a function of reaction temperature are shown in Fig. 3.
With increase of the reaction temperature, the propene yield markedly increased from 0.7% at 673 K to 30.6% at 873 K, whereas the selectivity to propene decreased from 100% at 673 K to 93.3% at 873 K, but the selectivities were still over 90% at all 428

The decrease of the propene selectivity could be partly attributed to the increase of the yield of by-products (methane and ethylene).

results clearly indicate that the high temperature accelerates coke deposition on the Ga2O3 catalyst surface.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of oxygen concentration on the propene yield and selectivity over Ga2O3. In the absence of O2, the selectivity is the highest. Increase of O2 concentration up to 9.1% weakly decrease propane conversion and propene yield.
Further investigations are needed to explain the ex- act mechanism of the effect of oxygen on the dehy- drogenation of propane with CO2.

3.4. Effect of the addition of potassium to the
Ga2O3 catalyst The carbon deposition is one of the major prob- lems in the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga2O3.
Coke formation is accelerated at high temperatures and in the presence of acid sites on the catalyst. There- fore, proper modification of acidity properties of the Ga2O3 catalyst can suppress the formation of coke.
For this purpose potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalyst

Moreover, potas- sium also assists in removing coke with steam as fol- lows:
C + H2O = CO + H2
(6) Table 1 shows the catalytic activities and product dis- tributions over unpromoted and potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts.
The catalytic activities of the potassium promoted catalysts are much lower than those observed with unpromoted catalyst. The propane conversion and propene selectivity dramatically decrease with in- creasing K/Ga atomic ratio. For the Ga2O3-K1 catalyst with K/Ga ratio of 0.03, the propane conversion and propene selectivity were 18.6 and 92.1%, while only
1.3 and 66.9%, respectively, in the case of Ga2O3-K2
(at K/Ga ratio = 0.1). This indicates that excess of potassium blocks active sites for dehydrogenation.
Probably, the acidic sites of gallium oxide were the active sites of the dehydrogenation of propane. The decrease in the catalytic activity is partly correlated with the decrease in the specific surface area of the catalyst.
3.5. Pulse reaction
Pulse reaction study was performed for better under- standing of the role of carbon dioxide in the dehydro- genation of propane. Before reaction, samples of the fresh catalysts were reduced by a pulse of hydrogen or propane. In both cases, respectively, 0.12 mmol of hydrogen or propane were used. Fig. 6 shows change in the amount of CO after treatment of the Ga2O3 samples with hydrogen (a) and propane (b).
The amount of CO slightly decreased from 5.4 × 104 to 1.6×104 mmol after treatment of the Ga2O3 catalyst with hydrogen. The amount of CO after sec- ond reduction cycle () with hydrogen was similar to that after the first cycle ( ). These results suggest that the carbon dioxide can react with hydrogen adsorbed on the Ga2O3 surface. However, we cannot exclude another explanation where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant in the oxidative pathway. This pathway is based on the redox cycle.
RCH2CH3 + MeOx = RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1 (7) The MeOx1 species, which lost the active O species,are reoxidised by the carbon dioxide. 432

CO2 + MeOx1 = CO + MeOx (8) The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to
7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide.
However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number. These results suggest that CO2 can remove the carbon deposit by the Boudouard reaction (4).
3.6. XRD analyses of the catalysts
Fig. 7 represents the phase detectable by XRD of unpromoted (a, b) and potassium promoted (c) gallium oxide catalysts.
For all of the Ga2O3 samples the major phase was confirmed to be -Ga2O3 which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known. For Ga2O3-K2 catalyst additionally K2CO3 was detected (Fig. 7c). No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before (Fig. 7a) and after (Fig. 7b) the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow. However, the fresh Ga2O3 cat- alyst was more amorphous than that after reaction at
873 K.
4. Conclusions
The obtained results lead to the following conclu- sions:• Bulk Ga2O3 prepared by thermal decomposition of gallium nitrate is an effective catalyst for dehydro- genation of propane to propene. • The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only ob- served in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the cata- lyst during the reaction. • The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.
