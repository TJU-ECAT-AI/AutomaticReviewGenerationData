<p>Dehydrogenation of propane to propene over gallium oxide in the presence of CO2 has been carried out.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The catalytic activity is affected by the acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts show a loss of activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the steps are:

1. RCH2CH3 + MeOx → RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1 (7)
2. CO2 + MeOx1 → CO + MeOx (8)

In these reactions, MeOx represents an active species that loses the oxygen atom in step 1 and is reoxidized by CO2 in step 2. This redox cycle facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。催化剂活性受到催化剂酸性位点的影响，因为钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂显示出活性的损失。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原-氧化循环，其中步骤如下：

1. RCH2CH3 + MeOx → RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1 (7)
2. CO2 + MeOx1 → CO + MeOx (8)

在这些反应中，MeOx代表一个失去氧原子的活性物种，在步骤1中，并通过CO2在步骤2中被重新氧化。这个还原-氧化循环促进了脱氢过程。
