<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon dioxide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the problem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The attractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for commercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They reported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8].</p>
<p>In our previous work we reported that gallium oxide showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 873 K, giving 30.6% propene yield with selectivity 93.3% [9].</p>
<p>It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas.</p>
<p>The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane can be considered as follows:</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is analyzed in the provided literature. The reducibility of the catalyst and the support material play crucial roles in determining the catalytic activity. Specifically, the introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is further detailed in the text.

The key points regarding the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials are:
1. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst reduces its activity.
2. The reaction takes place on acidic sites of the catalyst, as indicated by the behavior of potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts.
3. The proposed reaction mechanism includes a redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the steps RCH2CH3 + MeOx = RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1 and CO2 + MeOx1 = CO + MeOx.

The XRD analyses of the catalysts show that for all Ga2O3 samples, the major phase is confirmed to be -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, additional K2CO3 is detected. No significant changes in the diffraction patterns are observed between the patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under a CO2 flow. However, the fresh Ga2O3 catalyst is more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

本文分析了Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。催化剂的可还原性和支持材料对催化活性有重要影响。特别是，向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致催化剂活性降低。反应似乎在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这从钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂的行为中可以看出来。提出的反应机制包括Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，进一步详细说明在文本中。

关于催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响的关键点如下：
1. 向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾会降低其活性。
2. 反应发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，这是由镓氧化物钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂的行为所指示的。
3. 提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，包括步骤RCH2CH3 + MeOx = RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1和CO2 + MeOx1 = CO + MeOx。

X射线衍射分析显示，对于所有Ga2O3样品，主要相被确认为-Ga2O3，这是已知的唯一稳定的Ga2O3形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，还检测到了K2CO3。在CO2流下进行丙烷脱氢之前和之后获得的衍射图案之间没有显著的变化。然而，新鲜的Ga2O3催化剂比在873 K反应后更非晶态。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The catalytic activity is affected by the acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts show a loss of activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the steps are:

1. RCH2CH3 + MeOx → RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1 (7)
2. CO2 + MeOx1 → CO + MeOx (8)

In these reactions, MeOx represents an active species that loses the oxygen atom in step 1 and is reoxidized by CO2 in step 2. This redox cycle facilitates the dehydrogenation process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。催化剂活性受到催化剂酸性位点的影响，因为钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂显示出活性的损失。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原-氧化循环，其中步骤如下：

1. RCH2CH3 + MeOx → RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1 (7)
2. CO2 + MeOx1 → CO + MeOx (8)

在这些反应中，MeOx代表一个失去氧原子的活性物种，在步骤1中，并通过CO2在步骤2中被重新氧化。这个还原-氧化循环促进了脱氢过程。

However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene.

<p>2.2. Catalytic tests The dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 was carried out at atmospheric pressure in flow-type stainless steel reactor packed with 0.5 g of the catalyst and 1.5 g of quartz sand (grain size 0.20.3 mm). The feed was a mixture of 17 vol.% of propane and 83 vol.% of carbon dioxide. The total flow rate was 30 ml/min. The catalysts were first degassed in a helium stream at 873 K and then the reaction was started at this temperature. The samples for GC analyses were taken after 0.2 and 0.75 h.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly those in the form of Fe2O3 supported on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC), are effective in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The reducibility of these catalysts plays a crucial role in enhancing their catalytic activity. When a fresh Fe2O3/AC catalyst is treated with hydrogen or propane, the amount of CO adsorbed on the catalyst surface decreases, suggesting that CO2 can react with the hydrogen adsorbed on the surface or act as a mild oxidant in an oxidative pathway, leading to the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The support material, activated carbon (AC), is essential as it provides a high surface area for the Fe2O3 particles, facilitating better contact between the catalyst and the reactants. The interaction between Fe2O3 and AC might alter the reducibility and the distribution of Fe oxidation states, thus influencing the catalytic performance.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe2+ ions are oxidized to Fe3+ by CO2, forming FeO22-. This FeO22- species can then reduce back to Fe2+ in the presence of CO, forming CO2. This cycle is believed to be responsible for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2.

The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity, indicating that the reaction likely proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. This is consistent with the observation that potassium promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, acting as a mild oxidant.

In conclusion, Fe oxide-based catalysts, especially those supported on activated carbon, show promising performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The reducibility of the catalyst, along with the support material, significantly influences the catalytic activity. The proposed redox cycle of Fe oxide is a plausible mechanism for this reaction, and the acidity/basicity properties of the catalyst play a crucial role in determining its efficiency.

Fe氧化物基催化剂，特别是Fe2O3负载在活化碳（Fe2O3/AC）上的形式，在二氧化碳辅助下氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中表现出高效性。这些催化剂的可还原性在增强其催化活性方面起着关键作用。当新鲜的Fe2O3/AC催化剂用氢气或丙烷处理时，吸附在催化剂表面的CO量会减少，这表明CO2可以与吸附在表面的氢反应，或者作为氧化路径中的温和氧化剂，从而引发Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环。

支持材料，活化碳（AC），对于提供Fe2O3颗粒的高表面积至关重要，这有利于催化剂和反应物之间的良好接触。Fe2O3和AC之间的相互作用可能改变催化剂的可还原性和铁氧化态分布，从而影响催化性能。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe2+离子通过CO2被氧化为Fe3+，形成FeO22-。这种FeO22-物种然后可以在CO的存在下还原回Fe2+，形成CO2。该循环被认为是丙烷在CO2存在下氧化脱氢到丙烯的可能机制。

向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾会导致催化剂活性的损失，这表明反应似乎在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，因为含钾的镓氧化物催化剂没有显示出高活性。

总之，Fe氧化物基催化剂，尤其是负载在活化碳上的形式，在二氧化碳辅助下氧化脱氢丙烷中表现出有前景的性能。催化剂的可还原性和支持材料显著影响催化活性。提出的Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环是这种反应的合理机制，并且催化剂的酸碱性质对确定其效率起着关键作用。
