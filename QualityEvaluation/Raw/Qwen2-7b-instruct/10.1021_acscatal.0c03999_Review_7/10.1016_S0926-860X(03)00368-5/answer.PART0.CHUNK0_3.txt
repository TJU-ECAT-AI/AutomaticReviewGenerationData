[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]."
[2] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[3] "Furthermore, the required high temperature favours thermal cracking reactions to coke and light alkanes."
[4] "Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6."
[5] "In our previous work we reported that gallium oxide showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 873 K, giving 30.6% propene yield with selectivity 93.3% [9]."
[6] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction."
[7] "However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[8] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[9] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."
[10] "The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with C3H8 increased amount of carbon monoxide to 7.5 × 103 mmol after reoxidation by carbon dioxide."
[11] "However, the amount of CO gradually decreased with increasing pulse number."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is discussed in the document. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, influence catalytic activity. The role of carbon dioxide in the initial stage of reaction is highlighted. CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst, as evidenced by the behavior of potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts. The treatment of the fresh sample of Ga2O3 catalyst with propane resulted in an increase in the amount of carbon monoxide, which gradually decreased with increasing pulse number.

在文档中讨论了Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。催化剂可还原性和支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中，影响催化活性。在反应初期阶段，二氧化碳的作用被观察到。二氧化碳不抑制催化剂在反应过程中的快速失活。向镓氧化物添加钾会导致催化活性的丧失。反应似乎在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这是通过钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂的行为来证明的。新鲜的Ga2O3催化剂样品与丙烷处理后，碳一氧化合物的数量增加到了7.5×103 mmol，在用二氧化碳再氧化后。然而，随着脉冲数量的增加，碳一氧化合物的数量逐渐减少。
