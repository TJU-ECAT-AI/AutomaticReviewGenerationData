<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon dioxide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the problem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The attractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for commercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Recently, several research groups tried to use CO2 as a mild oxidant in dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons [25], synthesis of acrylonitrile [6] or in oxidative coupling of methane [7]. Its advantage is that the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 can be performed at relatively low temperature with high selectivity to C3H6.</p>
<p>Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance. Similar results were obtained by Takahara et al. [5] for dehydrogenation of propane. They reported that the carbon dioxide exerted promoting effect only on silica supported Cr2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>Nakagawa et al. [8] studied a series of metal-oxide catalysts in dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 and found that Ga2O3 was effective. Ethylene yield in the presence of CO2 was approximately twice of that in its absence.</p>
<p>The catalytic activity of gallium oxide catalysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8].</p>
<p>In our previous work we reported that gallium oxide showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of carbon dioxide at 873 K, giving 30.6% propene yield with selectivity 93.3% [9].</p>
<p>It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas.</p>
<p>The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane can be considered as follows:</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is analyzed in the provided literature. The reducibility of the catalyst and the support material play crucial roles in determining the catalytic activity. Specifically, the introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst leads to a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is further detailed in the text.

The key points regarding the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials are:
1. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst reduces its activity.
2. The reaction takes place on acidic sites of the catalyst, as indicated by the behavior of potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts.
3. The proposed reaction mechanism includes a redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the steps RCH2CH3 + MeOx = RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1 and CO2 + MeOx1 = CO + MeOx.

The XRD analyses of the catalysts show that for all Ga2O3 samples, the major phase is confirmed to be -Ga2O3, which is the only stable form of Ga2O3 known. For the Ga2O3-K2 catalyst, additional K2CO3 is detected. No significant changes in the diffraction patterns are observed between the patterns obtained before and after the dehydrogenation of propane under a CO2 flow. However, the fresh Ga2O3 catalyst is more amorphous than that after reaction at 873 K.

本文分析了Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。催化剂的可还原性和支持材料对催化活性有重要影响。特别是，向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致催化剂活性降低。反应似乎在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，这从钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂的行为中可以看出来。提出的反应机制包括Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，进一步详细说明在文本中。

关于催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响的关键点如下：
1. 向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾会降低其活性。
2. 反应发生在催化剂的酸性位点上，这是由镓氧化物钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂的行为所指示的。
3. 提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，包括步骤RCH2CH3 + MeOx = RCH=CH2 + H2O + MeOx1和CO2 + MeOx1 = CO + MeOx。

X射线衍射分析显示，对于所有Ga2O3样品，主要相被确认为-Ga2O3，这是已知的唯一稳定的Ga2O3形式。对于Ga2O3-K2催化剂，还检测到了K2CO3。在CO2流下进行丙烷脱氢之前和之后获得的衍射图案之间没有显著的变化。然而，新鲜的Ga2O3催化剂比在873 K反应后更非晶态。
