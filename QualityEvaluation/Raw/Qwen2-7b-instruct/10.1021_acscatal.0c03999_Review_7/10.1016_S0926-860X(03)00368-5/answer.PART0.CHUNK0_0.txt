[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]."
[2] "As all of the equivalent CH bonds in propane have equal chance of reacting, the dehydrogenation reaction is expected to be rather nonselective."
[3] "However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to remove heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high selectivity towards propene."
[4] "The key problem is the development of a new catalyst with desirable selectivity."
[5] "The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene can be considered as follows:"
[6] "Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted towards products."
[7] "The promoting role of carbon dioxide was only observed in the initial stage of reaction. However, CO2 does not suppress the fast deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction."
[8] "The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity."
[9] "The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst, since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity."
