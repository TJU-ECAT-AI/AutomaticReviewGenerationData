The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Fe2O3/AC shows high catalytic activity because of the synergistic effect between the Fe oxide and the activated carbon support. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed as the reaction mechanism, which enables the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
