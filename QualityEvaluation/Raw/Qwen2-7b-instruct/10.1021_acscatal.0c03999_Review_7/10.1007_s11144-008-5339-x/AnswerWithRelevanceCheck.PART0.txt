          [1] "The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has been extensively studied."
          [2] "Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play a crucial role in determining catalytic activity."
          [3] "The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is reduced to Fe(III) during the reaction."
          [4] "This redox cycle is facilitated by the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and the CO2 molecules, leading to the dehydrogenation of propane."

          The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Fe2O3/AC shows high catalytic activity due to the synergistic effect between the Fe oxide and the activated carbon support. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed as the reaction mechanism, which enables the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
