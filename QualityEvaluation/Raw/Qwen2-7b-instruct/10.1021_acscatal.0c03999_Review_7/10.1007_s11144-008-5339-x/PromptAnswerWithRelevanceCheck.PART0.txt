Answer: The literature does not provide specific details on the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), nor does it discuss the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials on catalytic activity. It also does not propose a reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has been studied. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, significantly influence catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is reduced to Fe(III) during the reaction, facilitated by the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and CO2 molecules, leading to the dehydrogenation of propane.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Fe2O3/AC shows high catalytic activity because of the synergistic effect between the Fe oxide and the activated carbon support. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is proposed as the reaction mechanism, which enables the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
