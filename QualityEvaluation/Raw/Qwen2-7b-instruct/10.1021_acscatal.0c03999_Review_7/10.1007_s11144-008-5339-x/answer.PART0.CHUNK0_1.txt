The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has been studied. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, significantly influence catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(II) is reduced to Fe(III) during the reaction, facilitated by the interaction between the Fe oxide catalyst and CO2 molecules, leading to the dehydrogenation of propane.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能已经进行了广泛研究。催化剂可还原性和支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中，对催化活性起着关键作用。提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在反应过程中Fe(II)被还原为Fe(III)，这种氧化还原循环由Fe氧化物催化剂与CO2分子之间的相互作用促进，导致丙烷的脱氢。
