[1] "The catalysts were characterized by XRD, TEM, N2 adsorption/desorption, and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)."
[2] "The CO2-ODHP reaction was carried out under a variety of conditions, including different temperatures, pressures, and gas compositions."
[3] "The catalyst performance was evaluated based on the conversion of propane and the selectivity towards propylene."
[4] "The redox cycle of Fe oxide was proposed to involve the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ during CO adsorption and subsequent oxidation to Fe3+ during the formation of propylene."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding how catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, influence catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism. The cycle involves the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ upon CO adsorption, followed by oxidation to Fe3+ during the formation of propylene.

分析在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中Fe氧化物基催化剂的性能，需要理解催化剂可还原性和支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中的影响。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环对反应机制至关重要。该循环涉及在CO吸附时Fe3+还原为Fe2+，随后在丙烯形成期间Fe3+的氧化。
