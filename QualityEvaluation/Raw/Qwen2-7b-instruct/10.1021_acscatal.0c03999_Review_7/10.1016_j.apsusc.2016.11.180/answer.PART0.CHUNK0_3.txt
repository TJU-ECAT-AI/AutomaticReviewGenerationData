The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, were found to significantly influence catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide was proposed as the mechanism involved in the reaction. The study demonstrated that the catalyst had high activity and stability, with the CO2-ODHP process conducted at 450°C, 1 atm pressure, and 1 h reaction time. An increase in the catalyst amount from 0.5 g to 1.0 g led to a yield of styrene rising from 50% to 70%. The Fe2O3/AC catalyst showed excellent activity due to its high surface area and redox properties.

对Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷的氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能进行了分析。催化剂可还原性和支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中的作用，被发现显著影响催化活性。提出了Fe氧化物的还原循环作为反应机制。研究表明，催化剂具有高活性和稳定性，CO2-ODHP过程在450°C、1 atm压力和1 h反应时间下进行。催化剂量从0.5 g增加到1.0 g导致苯乙烯产率从50%提高到70%。Fe2O3/AC催化剂由于其高比表面积和氧化还原性质而表现出出色的活性。
