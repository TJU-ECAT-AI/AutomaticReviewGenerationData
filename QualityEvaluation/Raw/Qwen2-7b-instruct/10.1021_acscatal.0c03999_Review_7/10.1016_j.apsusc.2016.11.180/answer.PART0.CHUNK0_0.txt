<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the literature. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, especially in the context of Fe2O3/AC, were found to significantly influence catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide was proposed as the reaction mechanism.
