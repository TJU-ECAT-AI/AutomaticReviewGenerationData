The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors. Firstly, the reducibility of the Fe oxide catalysts is critical for their effectiveness. Secondly, the support materials, notably in the context of Fe2O3/AC, impact catalytic activity significantly. Lastly, the reaction mechanism includes a redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is instrumental in converting propane to propylene.
