Catalysts based on iron oxides were employed in the process of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The ability of these catalysts to be reduced was observed to have a substantial effect on their catalytic efficiency. Specifically, the catalyst composed of Fe2O3 on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) demonstrated superior activity relative to other catalysts. The suggested reaction pathway features a redox cycle of iron oxide, which comprises reduction, oxidation, and regeneration stages.
