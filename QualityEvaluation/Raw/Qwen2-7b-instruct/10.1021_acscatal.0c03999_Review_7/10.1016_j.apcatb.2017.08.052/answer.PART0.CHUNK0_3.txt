<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) has been evaluated. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, have a significant impact on catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is suggested as the primary reaction mechanism. The catalyst system shows high activity in CO2-ODHP.
