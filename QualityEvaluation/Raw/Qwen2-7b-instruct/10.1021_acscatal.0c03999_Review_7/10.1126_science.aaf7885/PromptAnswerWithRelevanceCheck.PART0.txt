[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption."
[3] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the fact that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."
[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[5] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[6] "When using the supported vanadia catalyst the main byproducts are COx, accounting for 33% of total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion."
[7] "Meanwhile, the traditional V/SiO2 allows for a modest 61% propene selectivity at only 9% propane conversion (12)."
[8] "The obtained selectivities using state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (11, 13-19) are compared in Fig. 1A."
[9] "Comparisons between key reaction parameters of the referenced catalysts are included in table S1."
[10] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[11] "When using the supported vanadia catalyst the main byproducts are COx, accounting for 33% of total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion."
[12] "Conversely, when using BN materials, the main byproduct is ethene, a highly valuable olefin itself, rather than COx."
[13] "The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT: 975 m2 g−1 versus h-BN: 161 m2 g−1)."
[14] "This kinetic behavior clearly distinguishes boron nitride from traditional supported vanadia catalysts, which follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism (rate-determining substrate oxidation, followed by fast re-oxidation of the surface by oxygen)."
[15] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[16] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl-radical site."
[17] "Indeed, the one-dimensional nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of zero-dimensional single site catalysts) (34), and also the over-oxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of two-dimensional surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The reducibility of Fe oxide affects its ability to reduce CO2 to CO, enhancing the reaction efficiency. The support material, AC, provides a suitable surface for Fe oxide to be anchored, influencing the dispersion and thus the activity of the catalyst. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) to facilitate CO2 reduction to CO. The Fe(II) then oxidizes back to Fe(III) to regenerate the active site, allowing for continuous catalysis. The redox cycle is crucial for the efficiency of CO2-ODHP, as it enables the effective conversion of CO2 to CO, which can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), it is crucial to understand how catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, influence catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide includes several key steps. Initially, the Fe oxide catalyst is reduced under the reaction conditions, creating an active surface capable of facilitating the reaction. The support material, in this case, activated carbon (AC), provides a high surface area for the catalyst, enhancing the reaction efficiency and selectivity. During the CO2-ODHP process, CO2 acts as an electron acceptor, assisting in the reduction of the Fe oxide. This redox cycle is essential for the successful conversion of propane to propene, with the Fe oxide catalyst playing a critical role in promoting the reaction.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide is thought to involve multiple intermediates, including Fe(II) and Fe(III) states, which facilitate the transfer of electrons and hydrogen atoms between the catalyst and the reactants. This mechanism enables the selective conversion of propane into propene, with CO2 acting as a co-catalyst, potentially influencing the reaction pathway and product distribution. The precise details of the redox cycle, including the specific intermediates involved and the kinetics of the reaction, require further investigation through detailed kinetic studies and spectroscopic analysis.

The proposed reaction mechanism suggests that the Fe oxide catalyst undergoes a series of redox reactions, alternating between the Fe(II) and Fe(III) states, to promote the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The Fe(II) state is believed to be more active in reducing CO2, while the Fe(III) state facilitates the hydrogenation of the resulting aldehyde or ketone intermediates to form propene. The support material, AC, helps in stabilizing the catalyst structure, preventing sintering, and providing a suitable environment for the redox reactions to occur efficiently. The presence of CO2 assists in the reduction of Fe oxide, potentially through a synergistic effect with the Fe oxide catalyst, leading to a more effective and selective conversion of propane to propene.

In summary, the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is significantly influenced by the catalyst reducibility and the support material. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving multiple electron transfer steps, is central to the mechanism of this reaction, enabling the selective conversion of propane to propene with CO2 acting as a co-catalyst. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the detailed mechanisms and optimize the catalyst design for enhanced performance in CO2-ODHP processes.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，需要理解催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）如何影响催化活性。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环包括几个关键步骤。最初，Fe氧化物催化剂在反应条件下被还原，形成活性表面以促进反应。支持材料，在这种情况下为活化碳（AC），提供高比表面积，增强反应效率和选择性。在CO2-ODHP过程中，CO2作为电子受体，协助Fe氧化物的还原。这个还原循环对于成功将丙烷转化为丙烯至关重要，其中Fe氧化物催化剂在促进反应中起着核心作用。

提出的反应机制包括Fe氧化物催化剂的多个中间体，涉及Fe(II)和Fe(III)状态之间的电子转移，促进催化剂与反应物之间的电子和氢原子转移。这一机制使丙烷的选择性转化为丙烯成为可能，CO2作为协同催化剂，可能影响反应路径和产物分布。精确的还原循环细节，包括涉及的具体中间体和反应动力学，需要进一步通过详细的动力学研究和光谱分析进行调查。

提出的反应机制表明，Fe氧化物催化剂经历一系列还原反应，交替处于Fe(II)和Fe(III)状态，以促进丙烷的氧化脱氢。据信，Fe(II)状态更有利于还原CO2，而Fe(III)状态有助于醛或酮中间体的氢化，形成丙烯。支持材料，AC，有助于稳定催化剂结构，防止结块，并提供适当的环境，使得还原反应高效发生。CO2的存在有助于Fe氧化物的还原，可能通过与Fe氧化物催化剂的协同效应，导致丙烷更有效和选择性地转化为丙烯。

总之，Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢中的性能显著受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。Fe氧化物的还原循环，涉及多个电子转移步骤，是这一反应机制的核心，使丙烷选择性转化为丙烯成为可能，CO2作为协同催化剂发挥作用。需要进一步研究来完全阐明详细的机制并优化催化剂设计，以提高CO2-ODHP过程的性能。
