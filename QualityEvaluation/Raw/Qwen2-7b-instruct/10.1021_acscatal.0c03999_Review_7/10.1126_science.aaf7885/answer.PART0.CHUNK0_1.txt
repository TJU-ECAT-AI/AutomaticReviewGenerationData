[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption."
[3] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the fact that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."
[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[5] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[6] "When using the supported vanadia catalyst the main byproducts are COx, accounting for 33% of total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion."
[7] "Meanwhile, the traditional V/SiO2 allows for a modest 61% propene selectivity at only 9% propane conversion (12)."
[8] "The obtained selectivities using state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts (11, 13-19) are compared in Fig. 1A."
[9] "Comparisons between key reaction parameters of the referenced catalysts are included in table S1."
[10] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[11] "When using the supported vanadia catalyst the main byproducts are COx, accounting for 33% of total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion."
[12] "Conversely, when using BN materials, the main byproduct is ethene, a highly valuable olefin itself, rather than COx."
[13] "The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT: 975 m2 g−1 versus h-BN: 161 m2 g−1)."
[14] "This kinetic behavior clearly distinguishes boron nitride from traditional supported vanadia catalysts, which follow a Mars van Krevelen mechanism (rate-determining substrate oxidation, followed by fast re-oxidation of the surface by oxygen)."
[15] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[16] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl-radical site."
[17] "Indeed, the one-dimensional nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of zero-dimensional single site catalysts) (34), and also the over-oxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of two-dimensional surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The reducibility of Fe oxide affects its ability to reduce CO2 to CO, enhancing the reaction efficiency. The support material, AC, provides a suitable surface for Fe oxide to be anchored, influencing the dispersion and thus the activity of the catalyst. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) to facilitate CO2 reduction to CO. The Fe(II) then oxidizes back to Fe(III) to regenerate the active site, allowing for continuous catalysis. The redox cycle is crucial for the efficiency of CO2-ODHP, as it enables the effective conversion of CO2 to CO, which can then participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。Fe氧化物的可还原性影响其将CO2还原为CO的能力，从而提高反应效率。支持材料，如活性炭，为Fe氧化物提供了合适的表面，影响其分散度和活性。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在此过程中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，促进CO2的还原为CO。Fe(II)然后氧化回Fe(III)以再生活性位点，允许连续催化作用。氧化还原循环对于ODHP的效率至关重要，因为它使有效将CO2转化为CO成为可能，然后CO可以参与丙烷的氧化脱氢。
