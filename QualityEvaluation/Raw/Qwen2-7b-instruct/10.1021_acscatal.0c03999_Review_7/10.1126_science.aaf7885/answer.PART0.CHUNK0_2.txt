[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a contemporary example of such a challenging reaction."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "To date, supported vanadium oxide catalysts show the most promising activity for ODHP, owing to the favorable redox properties of the active vanadium sites."
[4] "The lack of kinetic control identifies the need for the discovery of alternative materials with the ability to bet- ter control this partial oxidation."
[5] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[6] "The entire product distribution further distinguishes boron nitride materials from supported vanadia catalysts (Fig. 1B)."
[7] "When using the supported vanadia catalyst the main byproducts are COx, accounting for 33% of total product selectivity at 9% propane conversion. Conversely, when using BN materials, the main byproduct is ethene, a highly valuable olefin itself, rather than COx."
[8] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity [kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1], comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this "on-purpose" propene technology."
[9] "Indeed,boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a signif- icant role."
[10] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity,spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[11] "We consider that the observed high olefin selectivity may largely be due to the stabilization of the propyl radical by the nitroxyl-radical site. Indeed, the one-dimensional nature of this edge avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical (typical of zero-dimensional single site catalysts) (34), and also the over-oxidation of the adsorbed species (typical of two-dimensional surface catalysts) is suppressed (35)."

Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

In the provided literature, there is no specific discussion about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The text focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials that exhibit unique catalytic properties for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene. The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not addressed in the document.

Answer: No relevant quotes found in the document regarding the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP).
