[1] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[2] "It is estimated that the potential energy savings for moving to ODHP would be around 45% of the energy consumption (4, 5)."
[3] "This gain in reaction efficiency, coupled with the fact that demand for propene is around 100,000 kt and its production consumes around 1 quad of energy, illustrates the potential impact of ODHP if it could be implemented on a large scale."
[4] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions. For instance, h-BN afforded 79% selectivity to propene at 14% propane conversion (Fig. 1A)."
[5] "Meanwhile, the traditional V/SiO2 allows for a modest 61% propene selectivity at only 9% propane conversion (12)."
[6] "The higher activity of BNNTs at least partially reflects the higher surface area of BNNTs relative to h-BN (BNNT: 975 m2 g1 versus h-BN: 161 m2 g1)."
[7] "This high reactivity and selectivity with BNNTs results in a substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity [kg-C3H6 kg-cat1 hr1] (Fig. 1C), comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation of this "on-purpose" propene technology (15, 21)."
[8] "The appearance and change of the different spectroscopic features furthermore indicates that a site is created by exposure of the material to propane and oxygen and that, in line with the higher intensity of this feature, a larger amount of these sites is present in the BNNT sample and the exposure to both propane and oxygen leads to the creation of those sites."
[9] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O-N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."
[10] "We suggest that the dehydrogenation initiates by the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the >B-O-O-N< sites, breaking the O-O bond while forming a B-OH species and one nitroxyl-radical (Fig. 3C)."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not discussed in the provided literature. The document focuses on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) as metal-free materials able to catalyze the ODHP reaction, showing high selectivity to propene and ethene.

在提供的文献中，并没有讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能。该文档主要关注六方氮化硼（h-BN）和氮化硼纳米管（BNNTs）作为无金属材料，能够催化ODHP反应，显示出高丙烯和乙烯选择性。
