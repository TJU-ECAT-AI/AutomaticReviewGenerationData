[1] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains,however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[2] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[3] "Indeed,boron nitride samples from various suppliers, containing different impurities (fig. S5) show almost identical catalytic performance (figs. S6 and S7), which indicates that said metal impurities in the material are unlikely to play a significant role."
[4] "We therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, it is mentioned that boron nitride (BN) materials, including hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), exhibit unique and unanticipated catalytic properties resulting in high selectivity to olefins, such as propene and ethene. The literature does not discuss the specifics of Fe oxide-based catalysts or their influence on catalytic activity, particularly in the context of CO2-ODHP. The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide is not presented in this document.

在提供的文献中，没有直接讨论Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。然而，文献提到，硼氮化物（BN）材料，包括六方硼氮化物（h-BN）和硼氮化物纳米管（BNNTs），显示出独特的催化特性，导致高烯烃选择性，如丙烯和乙烯。文献没有详细描述Fe氧化物基催化剂或它们对催化活性的影响，特别是在CO2-ODHP的背景下。关于Fe氧化物的还原循环所提出的反应机制没有在这份文件中呈现。
