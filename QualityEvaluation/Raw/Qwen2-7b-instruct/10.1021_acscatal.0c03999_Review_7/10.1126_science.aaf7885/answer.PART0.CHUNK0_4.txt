[1] "While propene is conventionally produced via steam cracking of large hydrocarbons in naphtha, the more recent trend to use shale gas as feeds to steam cracker units greatly increases the availability of low-cost ethene but also results in a gap between demand and supply of propene, as well as other higher olefins."
[2] "Despite non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation being the emerging technology used today, ODHP has the potential to improve reaction efficiency over its non-oxidative counterpart because of favorable thermodynamics (exothermic, lower reaction temperatures) and enhanced catalyst stability (prevention of coke deposition on the catalyst surface)."
[3] "Use of BN materials results in extraordinary selectivity to propene among the highest reported under ODHP conditions."
[4] "The key scientific challenge that must be overcome remains, however, the prevention of the facile over-oxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx)."
[5] "To better understand the catalytically active parts of the material and to provide evidence for oxygen functionali- zation of the BN surface when exposed to ODHP reaction conditions, we used a combination of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Attenuated Total Reflectance IR (ATR-IR), and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) measurements to characterize the material before (fresh) and after (spent) exposure to the ODHP reaction mixture."
[6] "Based upon the combination of catalytic activity, spectroscopic data and DFT calculations and in line with the observed oxygen-dependence of the kinetics, we therefore propose that an oxygen molecule bonded to one B and one N (an oxygen terminated armchair edge of BN (>B-O-O- N<)) acts as active site for the ODHP reaction."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), it is crucial to understand how catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, influence catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide includes several key steps. Initially, the Fe oxide catalyst is reduced under the reaction conditions, creating an active surface capable of facilitating the reaction. The support material, in this case, activated carbon (AC), provides a high surface area for the catalyst, enhancing the reaction efficiency and selectivity. During the CO2-ODHP process, CO2 acts as an electron acceptor, assisting in the reduction of the Fe oxide. This redox cycle is essential for the successful conversion of propane to propene, with the Fe oxide catalyst playing a critical role in promoting the reaction.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide is thought to involve multiple intermediates, including Fe(II) and Fe(III) states, which facilitate the transfer of electrons and hydrogen atoms between the catalyst and the reactants. This mechanism enables the selective conversion of propane into propene, with CO2 acting as a co-catalyst, potentially influencing the reaction pathway and product distribution. The precise details of the redox cycle, including the specific intermediates involved and the kinetics of the reaction, require further investigation through detailed kinetic studies and spectroscopic analysis.

The proposed reaction mechanism suggests that the Fe oxide catalyst undergoes a series of redox reactions, alternating between the Fe(II) and Fe(III) states, to promote the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The Fe(II) state is believed to be more active in reducing CO2, while the Fe(III) state facilitates the hydrogenation of the resulting aldehyde or ketone intermediates to form propene. The support material, AC, helps in stabilizing the catalyst structure, preventing sintering, and providing a suitable environment for the redox reactions to occur efficiently. The presence of CO2 assists in the reduction of Fe oxide, potentially through a synergistic effect with the Fe oxide catalyst, leading to a more effective and selective conversion of propane to propene.

In summary, the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is significantly influenced by the catalyst reducibility and the support material. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving multiple electron transfer steps, is central to the mechanism of this reaction, enabling the selective conversion of propane to propene with CO2 acting as a co-catalyst. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the detailed mechanisms and optimize the catalyst design for enhanced performance in CO2-ODHP processes.
