[1] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[2] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
[3] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[4] "Noteworthily, the absence of H2 from the reaction excludes the occurrence of RWGS. Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Answer: The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials. Specifically, the catalyst Fe2O3/AC outperforms others in terms of propane conversion and ethane yield, maintaining comparable ethane selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes significantly to the high catalytic performance. The reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where propane is oxidized to ethane on the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. The absence of hydrogen in the reaction excludes the occurrence of the water-gas shift (RWGS) process.

[1] 其中，Fe2O3/AC在丙烷转化率和乙烯产率上表现最佳，与裸露的Fe2O3的乙烯选择性相当（表7）。 
[2] H2-TPR结果表明，Fe2O3/AC表现出改进的还原性，其还原过程为Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe。
[3] 显然，Fe2O3在AC上的改善还原性解释了测试催化剂中获得的高催化性能，并且Fe氧化物的红ox循环在CO2-ODHP中起着关键作用。
[4] 值得注意的是，反应中没有H2排除了水煤气转换（RWGS）的发生。结合这些观察，可以推断出反应通过以下步骤进行：（i）丙烷在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上被氧化为乙烯，以及（ii）还原的Fe氧化物由CO2软氧化剂重新氧化。
