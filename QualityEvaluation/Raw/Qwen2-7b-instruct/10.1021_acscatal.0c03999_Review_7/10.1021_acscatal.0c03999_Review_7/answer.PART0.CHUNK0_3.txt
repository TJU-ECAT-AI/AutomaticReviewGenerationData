[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Michorczyk et al. have conducted screening tests on bare Fe2O3, supported Fe2O3 (active carbon (AC) and γ-Al2O3) catalysts, and hydrotalcite-derived MgFe oxides."
[3] "Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3."
[4] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe."
[5] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[6] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[7] "The reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals that catalysts featuring improved reducibility and specific support materials, particularly Fe2O3 on active carbon (AC), significantly enhance catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is pivotal in this process, driving the conversion of propane to propylene through oxidative dehydrogenation. Specifically, Fe2O3 catalysts supported on AC show superior performance compared to those on γ-Al2O3 or MgFe oxides, primarily due to the enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC. This improved reducibility facilitates the redox cycle, allowing for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. The reaction mechanism involves the oxidation of propane to propylene on the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. This process effectively converts propane into propylene, highlighting the critical role of the redox cycle and catalyst design in achieving high efficiency in CO2-ODHP.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能表明，具有改进还原性和特定支撑材料（尤其是Fe2O3在活性碳（AC）上的负载）的催化剂显著提高了催化活性。铁氧化物的红ox循环在这一过程中起着关键作用，驱动丙烷转化为丙烯的过程。具体来说，负载在AC上的Fe2O3催化剂比负载在γ-Al2O3或MgFe氧化物上的催化剂表现出更优越的性能，主要归因于Fe2O3在AC上的增强可还原性。这种增强的可还原性促进了Fe氧化物的红ox循环，从而实现了更高效的丙烷转化为丙烯。该反应机制涉及丙烷在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上的氧化转化为丙烯，随后通过CO2软氧化剂重新氧化减少的Fe氧化物。这一过程有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，突出了红ox循环和催化剂设计在实现高效CO2-ODHP中的关键作用。
