[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
[4] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[5] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the study highlights the superior activity of Fe2O3/AC compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on an active carbon (AC) support, as demonstrated by hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) results, plays a crucial role in the high catalytic performance. This is attributed to the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which involves the oxidation of propane to produce propene and the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. The study further elucidates that the interaction between Fe oxide and support materials, such as γ-Al2O3, results in the formation of a spinel phase, which retards the reducibility of Fe oxide, leading to lower catalytic performance compared to Fe2O3/AC.

在CO2辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中，铁氧化物基催化剂的表现分析表明，Fe2O3/AC的活性显著优于其他铁氧化物基催化剂。改善的Fe2O3在活性碳（AC）支持上的还原性，根据氢温度程序化还原（H2-TPR）结果，对高催化性能至关重要。这归因于Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，它涉及丙烷的氧化产生丙烯以及由CO2软氧化剂重新氧化还原Fe氧化物的过程。研究进一步阐明，Fe氧化物与支撑材料（如γ-Al2O3）之间的相互作用会导致Fe氧化物形成尖晶石相，从而减缓其还原性，导致催化性能低于Fe2O3/AC。

Answer: The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials. Specifically, the catalyst Fe2O3/AC outperforms others in terms of propane conversion and ethane yield, maintaining comparable ethane selectivity to bare Fe2O3. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC contributes significantly to the high catalytic performance. The reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where propane is oxidized to ethane on the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. The absence of hydrogen in the reaction excludes the occurrence of the water-gas shift (RWGS) process.

[1] 其中，Fe2O3/AC在丙烷转化率和乙烯产率上表现最佳，与裸露的Fe2O3的乙烯选择性相当（表7）。 
[2] H2-TPR结果表明，Fe2O3/AC表现出改进的还原性，其还原过程为Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe。
[3] 显然，Fe2O3在AC上的改善还原性解释了测试催化剂中获得的高催化性能，并且Fe氧化物的红ox循环在CO2-ODHP中起着关键作用。
[4] 值得注意的是，反应中没有H2排除了水煤气转换（RWGS）的发生。结合这些观察，可以推断出反应通过以下步骤进行：（i）丙烷在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上被氧化为乙烯，以及（ii）还原的Fe氧化物由CO2软氧化剂重新氧化。

Analysis of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals that catalysts featuring improved reducibility and specific support materials, particularly Fe2O3 on active carbon (AC), significantly enhance catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is pivotal in this process, driving the conversion of propane to propylene through oxidative dehydrogenation. Specifically, Fe2O3 catalysts supported on AC show superior performance compared to those on γ-Al2O3 or MgFe oxides, primarily due to the enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC. This improved reducibility facilitates the redox cycle, allowing for more efficient conversion of propane to propylene. The reaction mechanism involves the oxidation of propane to propylene on the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. This process effectively converts propane into propylene, highlighting the critical role of the redox cycle and catalyst design in achieving high efficiency in CO2-ODHP.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能表明，具有改进还原性和特定支撑材料（尤其是Fe2O3在活性碳（AC）上的负载）的催化剂显著提高了催化活性。铁氧化物的红ox循环在这一过程中起着关键作用，驱动丙烷转化为丙烯的过程。具体来说，负载在AC上的Fe2O3催化剂比负载在γ-Al2O3或MgFe氧化物上的催化剂表现出更优越的性能，主要归因于Fe2O3在AC上的增强可还原性。这种增强的可还原性促进了Fe氧化物的红ox循环，从而实现了更高效的丙烷转化为丙烯。该反应机制涉及丙烷在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上的氧化转化为丙烯，随后通过CO2软氧化剂重新氧化减少的Fe氧化物。这一过程有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，突出了红ox循环和催化剂设计在实现高效CO2-ODHP中的关键作用。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the catalyst's reducibility and the properties of the support material. Specifically, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst shows superior performance in both propane conversion and propane hexene yield compared to bare Fe2O3. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on activated carbon (AC) contributes to the high catalytic activity of this system. The reduction process of Fe2O3 follows the sequence Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. The use of γ-Al2O3 as a support leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3, which is hardly reduced, and the Fe3+ ions are stabilized in the MgO matrix. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the oxidation of propane to propane hexene on the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant.
