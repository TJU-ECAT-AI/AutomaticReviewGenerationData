[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[4] "Clearly, the improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on AC accounts for the obtained high catalytic performance among the catalysts tested, and the redox cycle of Fe oxide likely plays a crucial role in CO2ODHP."
[5] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the type of support materials. Specifically, Fe2O3/AC catalysts exhibit superior performance compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on the active carbon (AC) support leads to higher catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a critical role in the reaction mechanism. The proposed mechanism involves the oxidation of propane to propane-derivative intermediates on the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4. Subsequently, the reduced Fe oxide is reoxidized by the CO2 soft oxidant, contributing to the overall catalytic process.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到其还原性和支撑材料类型的影响。特别是，Fe2O3/AC催化剂表现出与纯Fe2O3相比更高的转化率和丙烯衍生物的产率。Fe2O3在活性碳（AC）支持上的增强还原性导致了更高的催化活性。铁氧化物的还原循环在反应机制中起着关键作用。提出的机制涉及丙烷在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上的氧化生成丙烷衍生物中间体。随后，还原的Fe氧化物通过CO2软氧化剂重新氧化，对整个催化过程产生贡献。
