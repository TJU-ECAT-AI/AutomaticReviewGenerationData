[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe."
[4] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[5] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the catalyst's reducibility and the properties of the support material. Specifically, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst shows superior performance in both propane conversion and propane hexene yield compared to bare Fe2O3. The enhanced reducibility of Fe2O3 on activated carbon (AC) contributes to the high catalytic activity of this system. The reduction process of Fe2O3 follows the sequence Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe. The use of γ-Al2O3 as a support leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3, which is hardly reduced, and the Fe3+ ions are stabilized in the MgO matrix. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the oxidation of propane to propane hexene on the lattice oxygen of Fe2O3 or Fe3O4, followed by the reoxidation of the reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant.

Fe氧化物催化剂在CO2辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支撑材料性质的影响。具体而言，Fe2O3/AC催化剂在丙烷转化率和丙烷己烯产率方面表现出优异性能，与裸露的Fe2O3相比。Fe2O3在活性碳（AC）上的增强可还原性是此系统高催化活性的关键。Fe2O3的还原过程遵循Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 → FeO → Fe的序列。使用γ-Al2O3作为支撑材料会导致FeAl2O3尖晶石相的形成，该相很难被还原，Fe3+离子在MgO矩阵中被稳定化。γ-Al2O3作为支持材料的使用导致FeAl2O3尖晶石相的形成，该相难以被还原，Fe3+离子在MgO矩阵中被稳定化。提出的反应机制涉及在Fe2O3或Fe3O4的晶格氧上氧化丙烷到丙烷己烯，随后通过CO2软氧化剂重新氧化还原的Fe氧化物。
