[1] "Fe oxide-based catalysts are potential candidates for CO2ODHP as they have been known to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, such as ethylbenzene and isobutane."
[2] "Among them, Fe2O3/AC outperforms the rest in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield, along with comparable C3H6 selectivity to the bare Fe2O3 (Table 7)."
[3] "H2-TPR results demonstrate that Fe2O3/AC exhibits improved reducibility, and its reduction proceeds through Fe2O3  Fe3O4  FeO  Fe."
[4] "For example, loading Fe2O3 on γ-Al2O3 leads to the formation of a spinel phase FeAl2O3 which is hardly reduced; Fe3+ cations are reduced to Fe2+ ions which are strongly stabilized in the MgO matrix."
[5] "Combined with these observations, it is postulated that the reaction proceeds through (i) C3H8 oxidation to C3H6 on lattice oxygen from Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 and (ii) reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the study highlights the superior activity of Fe2O3/AC compared to other Fe oxide-based catalysts. The improved reducibility of Fe2O3 on an active carbon (AC) support, as demonstrated by hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) results, plays a crucial role in the high catalytic performance. This is attributed to the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which involves the oxidation of propane to produce propene and the reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide by the CO2 soft oxidant. The study further elucidates that the interaction between Fe oxide and support materials, such as γ-Al2O3, results in the formation of a spinel phase, which retards the reducibility of Fe oxide, leading to lower catalytic performance compared to Fe2O3/AC.

在CO2辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中，铁氧化物基催化剂的表现分析表明，Fe2O3/AC的活性显著优于其他铁氧化物基催化剂。改善的Fe2O3在活性碳（AC）支持上的还原性，根据氢温度程序化还原（H2-TPR）结果，对高催化性能至关重要。这归因于Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，它涉及丙烷的氧化产生丙烯以及由CO2软氧化剂重新氧化还原Fe氧化物的过程。研究进一步阐明，Fe氧化物与支撑材料（如γ-Al2O3）之间的相互作用会导致Fe氧化物形成尖晶石相，从而减缓其还原性，导致催化性能低于Fe2O3/AC。
