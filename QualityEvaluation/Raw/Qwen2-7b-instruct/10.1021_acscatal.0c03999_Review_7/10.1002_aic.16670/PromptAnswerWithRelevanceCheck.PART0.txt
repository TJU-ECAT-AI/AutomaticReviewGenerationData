[1] "Fe3Ni1 was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."
[2] "Doubling the catalyst metal loading but maintaining the 3:1 Fe to Ni ratio (Fe9Ni3) increased the conversion but negatively impacted the selectivity toward propylene (22.5% SC3H6 at 3.4% XC3H6)."
[3] "Setting an equal atomic concentration of Fe to Ni (Fe3Ni3) also increased the conversion, but at 5.0% C3H8 conversion only exhibited 20.4% C3H6 selectivity."
[4] "Finally, changing the atomic ratio from Fe3Ni1 to Fe1Ni3 also increased the catalyst activity but completely altered the selectivity pathway to favor the DRP (90.6% SCO) even at a comparable propane conversion of 2.1%."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was studied. It was found that catalyst reducibility and support materials significantly influenced catalytic activity. For instance, the Fe2O3/AC support material was crucial for enhancing the catalytic performance. The redox cycle of Fe oxide played a key role in the proposed reaction mechanism, contributing to the activation of CO2 and facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The study also highlighted the importance of the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni in the Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts. Doubling the Fe loading in the Fe9Ni3 catalyst increased the conversion but decreased the selectivity towards propylene. Similarly, setting an equal atomic concentration of Fe to Ni in the Fe3Ni3 catalyst increased the conversion but reduced the propylene selectivity. Lastly, changing the atomic ratio from Fe3Ni1 to Fe1Ni3 in the catalyst increased its activity while shifting the selectivity pathway to favor the dry reforming process, even at a comparable propane conversion.

These findings suggest that the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni significantly affects the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. Optimizing the atomic ratio can help tailor the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards the desired products, propylene or synthesis gas, depending on the application requirements.

对CO2辅助氧化脱氢反应中的Fe氧化物基催化剂性能的研究表明，催化剂的可还原性和支持材料对于催化活性有显著影响。例如，Fe2O3/AC支持材料对于提高催化性能至关重要。Fe氧化物的还原循环在提出的反应机制中起着关键作用，有助于激活CO2并促进氧化脱氢过程。

研究还强调了Fe-Ni双金属催化剂中Fe与Ni原子比的重要性。将Fe的负载量翻倍在Fe9Ni3催化剂中增加了转化率但降低了丙烯选择性（丙烯选择性为22.5%，丙烷转化率为3.4%）。同样，将Fe和Ni的原子浓度设置相等在Fe3Ni3催化剂中增加了转化率但降低了丙烯选择性（丙烯选择性为20.4%，丙烷转化率为5.0%）。最后，将Fe3Ni1催化剂的原子比从Fe1Ni3改变到Fe1Ni3后，催化剂的活性增加，而选择性路径完全转向有利于干重整（丙烷转化率为2.1%，选择性为90.6%）。

这些发现表明，Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的性能受到Fe与Ni原子比的影响。优化原子比可以帮助调整催化剂的活性和选择性，以适应所需的产品，即丙烯或合成气，具体取决于应用需求。

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding the role of catalyst reducibility and the influence of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in activating CO2 for the reaction. Support materials, especially those with high surface areas and capable of accommodating oxygen vacancies, facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2. The Fe2O3/AC composite supports provide a platform where Fe oxide can be reduced and reoxidized, participating in a redox cycle that enhances the catalytic activity for CO2 reduction. 

In the context of Fe oxide-based catalysts, the reducibility of Fe2O3 allows it to absorb CO2 and facilitate its activation through a redox reaction. The reoxidation step regenerates the Fe oxide surface, ready for the next cycle of CO2 adsorption and activation. This cyclic behavior contributes to the catalytic efficiency of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), ensures that the Fe oxide particles are well dispersed and have a high surface area, which is essential for efficient CO2 adsorption and activation.

The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide suggests that during the reaction, Fe oxide in its reduced form (Fe+) can adsorb CO2, leading to the breaking of C-O bonds. Upon reoxidation (Fe3+), the liberated oxygen species can participate in further reactions, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox cycle ensures continuous activation of CO2 and supports the catalytic conversion of propane into propylene in the presence of CO2.

The Fe oxide-based catalysts showed different performances in terms of CO2 and propane conversions. Fe3Ni1 catalysts were found to be less active at steady state, while Fe1Ni3 catalysts favored the dry reforming pathway. The Co3Ni1 catalyst demonstrated higher steady-state conversion and improved stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, showcasing the synergistic effect of cobalt and nickel in enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP reactions.

In summary, the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support materials, particularly the Fe2O3/AC composite, play a significant role in the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox cycle of Fe oxide facilitates the activation of CO2, leading to efficient conversion of propane into propylene in the presence of CO2.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及到理解催化剂还原性的作用和支持材料的影响，尤其是铁氧化物/活性炭（Fe2O3/AC）。铁氧化物的可还原性在激活CO2反应中起着关键作用。支持材料，特别是具有高比表面积并能容纳氧空位的材料，有助于CO2的吸附和活化。Fe2O3/AC复合支持提供了铁氧化物表面可以被还原和重新氧化的平台，这增强了CO2减少的催化活性。

在铁氧化物基催化剂的背景下，Fe2O3的可还原性使其能够吸收CO2并通过还原反应促进其活化。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），确保Fe氧化物颗粒分散良好且比表面积高，这对于有效CO2吸附和活化至关重要。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的红ox循环，表明在反应过程中，还原形式的Fe氧化物（Fe+）可以吸附CO2，导致C-O键的断裂。在重新氧化（Fe3+）时，释放出的氧物种可以参与进一步的反应，例如丙烷的氧化脱氢。循环行为保证了CO2的持续激活，并支持Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化效率。

在不同Fe氧化物基催化剂中观察到了不同的CO2和丙烷转化率。Fe3Ni1催化剂在稳定状态下显示出较低的活性，而Fe1Ni3催化剂倾向于干燥重整途径。Co3Ni1催化剂展示了更高的稳定性和改善的转化率，与镍1和钴3相比，这表明钴和镍的协同效应在提高CO2-ODHP反应的催化活性和选择性方面的作用。

综上所述，Fe氧化物的可还原性及其支持材料，尤其是Fe2O3/AC复合体，在Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下对丙烷氧化脱氢的性能中扮演着重要角色。Fe氧化物的红ox循环促进了CO2的激活，从而有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，在存在CO2的情况下。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Specifically, catalysts containing Fe2O3/AC exhibit high reducibility, allowing for efficient activation of CO2. This is crucial for the CO2-ODHP reaction, where CO2 needs to be converted into useful products. The support material, AC (activated carbon), provides a suitable environment for the Fe oxide catalyst to interact with CO2, enhancing the conversion efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide involves the following steps:
1. Fe oxide is reduced by hydrogen, creating an active surface.
2. CO2 adsorbs onto this active surface.
3. The adsorbed CO2 is then reduced, leading to the formation of CO and H2.
4. The CO formed reacts with propane, undergoing oxidative dehydrogenation to produce propylene.

The reducibility of Fe oxide and the interaction with AC support enable the catalyst to efficiently perform the CO2-ODHP reaction. The redox cycle of Fe oxide ensures that the catalyst remains active throughout the reaction, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process.
