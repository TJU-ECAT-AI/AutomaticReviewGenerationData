[1] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperformed Pd-based catalysts on both mass-based conversion and site-specific TOF values."
[2] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[3] "The CoxNiy catalyst, which are composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, were also active and selective for the DRP pathway."
[4] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[5] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Specifically, catalysts containing Fe2O3/AC exhibit high reducibility, allowing for efficient activation of CO2. This is crucial for the CO2-ODHP reaction, where CO2 needs to be converted into useful products. The support material, AC (activated carbon), provides a suitable environment for the Fe oxide catalyst to interact with CO2, enhancing the conversion efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide involves the following steps:
1. Fe oxide is reduced by hydrogen, creating an active surface.
2. CO2 adsorbs onto this active surface.
3. The adsorbed CO2 is then reduced, leading to the formation of CO and H2.
4. The CO formed reacts with propane, undergoing oxidative dehydrogenation to produce propylene.

The reducibility of Fe oxide and the interaction with AC support enable the catalyst to efficiently perform the CO2-ODHP reaction. The redox cycle of Fe oxide ensures that the catalyst remains active throughout the reaction, contributing to the overall efficiency of the process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。具体来说，包含Fe2O3/AC的催化剂表现出高可还原性，允许高效激活CO2。这对于CO2-ODHP反应至关重要，因为需要将CO2转换为有用的产物。支持材料AC（活性炭）为Fe氧化物催化剂与CO2相互作用提供了合适的环境，提高了转化效率。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环如下：
1. Fe氧化物通过氢被还原，形成活性表面。
2. CO2吸附到这个活性表面上。
3. 吸附的CO2随后被还原，导致CO和H2的形成。
4. 形成的CO与丙烷反应，经过氧化脱氢生成丙烯。

Fe氧化物的可还原性和与AC支持材料的相互作用使催化剂能够高效执行CO2-ODHP反应。Fe氧化物的还原循环确保催化剂在整个反应过程中保持活性，从而提高过程的整体效率。
