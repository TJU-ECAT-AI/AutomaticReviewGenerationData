Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding the role of catalyst reducibility and the influence of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in activating CO2 for the reaction. Support materials, especially those with high surface areas and capable of accommodating oxygen vacancies, facilitate the adsorption and activation of CO2. The Fe2O3/AC composite supports provide a platform where Fe oxide can be reduced and reoxidized, participating in a redox cycle that enhances the catalytic activity for CO2 reduction. 

In the context of Fe oxide-based catalysts, the reducibility of Fe2O3 allows it to absorb CO2 and facilitate its activation through a redox reaction. The reoxidation step regenerates the Fe oxide surface, ready for the next cycle of CO2 adsorption and activation. This cyclic behavior contributes to the catalytic efficiency of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP reactions. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), ensures that the Fe oxide particles are well dispersed and have a high surface area, which is essential for efficient CO2 adsorption and activation.

The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide suggests that during the reaction, Fe oxide in its reduced form (Fe+) can adsorb CO2, leading to the breaking of C-O bonds. Upon reoxidation (Fe3+), the liberated oxygen species can participate in further reactions, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox cycle ensures continuous activation of CO2 and supports the catalytic conversion of propane into propylene in the presence of CO2.

The Fe oxide-based catalysts showed different performances in terms of CO2 and propane conversions. Fe3Ni1 catalysts were found to be less active at steady state, while Fe1Ni3 catalysts favored the dry reforming pathway. The Co3Ni1 catalyst demonstrated higher steady-state conversion and improved stability compared to Ni1 and Co3, showcasing the synergistic effect of cobalt and nickel in enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP reactions.

In summary, the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support materials, particularly the Fe2O3/AC composite, play a significant role in the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox cycle of Fe oxide facilitates the activation of CO2, leading to efficient conversion of propane into propylene in the presence of CO2.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及到理解催化剂还原性的作用和支持材料的影响，尤其是铁氧化物/活性炭（Fe2O3/AC）。铁氧化物的可还原性在激活CO2反应中起着关键作用。支持材料，特别是具有高比表面积并能容纳氧空位的材料，有助于CO2的吸附和活化。Fe2O3/AC复合支持提供了铁氧化物表面可以被还原和重新氧化的平台，这增强了CO2减少的催化活性。

在铁氧化物基催化剂的背景下，Fe2O3的可还原性使其能够吸收CO2并通过还原反应促进其活化。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），确保Fe氧化物颗粒分散良好且比表面积高，这对于有效CO2吸附和活化至关重要。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的红ox循环，表明在反应过程中，还原形式的Fe氧化物（Fe+）可以吸附CO2，导致C-O键的断裂。在重新氧化（Fe3+）时，释放出的氧物种可以参与进一步的反应，例如丙烷的氧化脱氢。循环行为保证了CO2的持续激活，并支持Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中的催化效率。

在不同Fe氧化物基催化剂中观察到了不同的CO2和丙烷转化率。Fe3Ni1催化剂在稳定状态下显示出较低的活性，而Fe1Ni3催化剂倾向于干燥重整途径。Co3Ni1催化剂展示了更高的稳定性和改善的转化率，与镍1和钴3相比，这表明钴和镍的协同效应在提高CO2-ODHP反应的催化活性和选择性方面的作用。

综上所述，Fe氧化物的可还原性及其支持材料，尤其是Fe2O3/AC复合体，在Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下对丙烷氧化脱氢的性能中扮演着重要角色。Fe氧化物的红ox循环促进了CO2的激活，从而有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，在存在CO2的情况下。
