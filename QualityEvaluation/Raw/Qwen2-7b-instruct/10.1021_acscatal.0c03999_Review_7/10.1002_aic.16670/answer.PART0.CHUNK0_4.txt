The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. High reducibility of Fe oxide allows for better activation of CO2, leading to enhanced catalytic activity. The support material, such as AC, provides a suitable environment for the formation of redox centers crucial for the reaction mechanism. In the redox cycle of Fe oxide, the Cr6+ active center generated from a redox cycle with Cr3+ plays a key role in activating CO2. Moreover, CeO2 supports high oxygen vacancy concentrations without structural change, which is beneficial for CO2 adsorption and activation. The metallic Ni and oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni1 catalyst under reaction conditions suggests that the catalyst can efficiently facilitate the CO2-ODHP pathway, contributing to its selectivity and activity.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。高可还原性使Fe氧化物能够更好地激活CO2，从而提高催化活性。支持材料如AC为形成反应机制所需的还原中心提供了合适的环境。在Fe氧化物的还原循环中，从Cr3+到Cr6+的活性中心对于激活CO2起着关键作用。此外，CeO2能够容纳高氧空位浓度而不会改变晶体结构，这对于CO2吸附和激活是有利的。Fe3Ni1催化剂下反应条件下的金属Ni和氧化铁表明，催化剂可以有效地促进CO2-ODHP途径，有助于其选择性和活性。
