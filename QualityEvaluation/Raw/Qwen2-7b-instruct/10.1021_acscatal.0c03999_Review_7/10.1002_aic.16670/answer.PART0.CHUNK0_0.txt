[1] "Fe3Ni1 was a promising system for the CO2-ODHP reaction."
[2] "Doubling the catalyst metal loading but maintaining the 3:1 Fe to Ni ratio (Fe9Ni3) increased the conversion but negatively impacted the selectivity toward propylene (22.5% SC3H6 at 3.4% XC3H6)."
[3] "Setting an equal atomic concentration of Fe to Ni (Fe3Ni3) also increased the conversion, but at 5.0% C3H8 conversion only exhibited 20.4% C3H6 selectivity."
[4] "Finally, changing the atomic ratio from Fe3Ni1 to Fe1Ni3 also increased the catalyst activity but completely altered the selectivity pathway to favor the DRP (90.6% SCO) even at a comparable propane conversion of 2.1%."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was studied. It was found that catalyst reducibility and support materials significantly influenced catalytic activity. For instance, the Fe2O3/AC support material was crucial for enhancing the catalytic performance. The redox cycle of Fe oxide played a key role in the proposed reaction mechanism, contributing to the activation of CO2 and facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation process.

The study also highlighted the importance of the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni in the Fe-Ni bimetallic catalysts. Doubling the Fe loading in the Fe9Ni3 catalyst increased the conversion but decreased the selectivity towards propylene. Similarly, setting an equal atomic concentration of Fe to Ni in the Fe3Ni3 catalyst increased the conversion but reduced the propylene selectivity. Lastly, changing the atomic ratio from Fe3Ni1 to Fe1Ni3 in the catalyst increased its activity while shifting the selectivity pathway to favor the dry reforming process, even at a comparable propane conversion.

These findings suggest that the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni significantly affects the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. Optimizing the atomic ratio can help tailor the catalyst's activity and selectivity towards the desired products, propylene or synthesis gas, depending on the application requirements.

对CO2辅助氧化脱氢反应中的Fe氧化物基催化剂性能的研究表明，催化剂的可还原性和支持材料对于催化活性有显著影响。例如，Fe2O3/AC支持材料对于提高催化性能至关重要。Fe氧化物的还原循环在提出的反应机制中起着关键作用，有助于激活CO2并促进氧化脱氢过程。

研究还强调了Fe-Ni双金属催化剂中Fe与Ni原子比的重要性。将Fe的负载量翻倍在Fe9Ni3催化剂中增加了转化率但降低了丙烯选择性（丙烯选择性为22.5%，丙烷转化率为3.4%）。同样，将Fe和Ni的原子浓度设置相等在Fe3Ni3催化剂中增加了转化率但降低了丙烯选择性（丙烯选择性为20.4%，丙烷转化率为5.0%）。最后，将Fe3Ni1催化剂的原子比从Fe1Ni3改变到Fe1Ni3后，催化剂的活性增加，而选择性路径完全转向有利于干重整（丙烷转化率为2.1%，选择性为90.6%）。

这些发现表明，Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的性能受到Fe与Ni原子比的影响。优化原子比可以帮助调整催化剂的活性和选择性，以适应所需的产品，即丙烯或合成气，具体取决于应用需求。
