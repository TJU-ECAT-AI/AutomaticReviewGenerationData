[1] "The effects of bimetallic interactions for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming of propane"
[2] "Pt-based bimetallic catalysts outperformed Pd-based catalysts on both mass-based conversion and site-specific TOF values."
[3] "Compared to monometallic Pt1 and Pd1, the bimetallics with Ni3 and Co3 were not only more active, but also exhibited greater stability."
[4] "The CoxNiy catalyst, which are composed of metallic Co and Ni under reaction conditions, were also active and selective for the DRP pathway."
[5] "In comparison, the FexNiy catalysts exhibited selectivity toward CO2-ODHP, and the selectivity can be further modified by changing the Ni content in the bimetallic composition."
[6] "Increasing the Ni atomic ratio above 1 altered the selectivity to favor the DRP pathway rather than CO2-ODHP."
