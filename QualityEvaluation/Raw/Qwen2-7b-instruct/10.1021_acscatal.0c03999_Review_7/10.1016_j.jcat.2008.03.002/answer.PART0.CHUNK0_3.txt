[1] "The role of vanadyl and peroxovanadate oxygen species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was analyzed by density functional theory (DFT)."
[2] "O2 was a more active oxidizing agent than N2O."
[3] "N2O and O2 also differ in terms of the nature of oxygen species formed on reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
[4] "N2O is less active and can oxidize VIII sites only, whereas O2 can oxidize both VIII and VIV."
[5] "Only in the case of reoxidation by O2 is the vanadyl oxygen species reached via a peroxovanadate precursor."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the type of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. Reducibility affects the ability of the catalyst to reduce and regenerate its active sites during the reaction. The type of support material influences the dispersion of the Fe oxide, which impacts the accessibility of reactants and products. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, as it determines the ability of the catalyst to oxidize and reduce propane efficiently.

The nature of the oxidizing agent also significantly impacts the catalytic activity. Oxygen species formed during reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide sites vary between N2O and O2. N2O can only oxidize VIII sites, while O2 can oxidize both VIII and VIV sites. The formation of a peroxovanadate precursor during reoxidation by O2 leads to a more reactive species for propene oxidation compared to vanadyl species. This explains why propene is formed primarily from propane via oxidative dehydrogenation by lattice oxygen of Fe oxide species, and why the presence of peroxovanadate enhances the catalytic activity for consecutive propene oxidation.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性的影响，以及支持材料的类型，特别是Fe2O3/AC系统。可还原性决定了催化剂在反应过程中减少和再生其活性位点的能力。支持材料的类型影响Fe氧化物的分散度，这影响了反应物和产物的可接近性。Fe氧化物的还原循环对催化活性至关重要，因为它决定了催化剂有效氧化和还原丙烷的能力。

氧化剂的性质也显著影响催化活性。在还原Fe氧化物位点期间形成的不同氧物种之间，N2O只能氧化VIII位点，而O2可以氧化VIII和VIV位点。通过O2进行再氧化时形成的过氧钒酸盐前体导致了比钒酸盐物种更活跃的物种，用于丙烯氧化。这就是为什么丙烯主要通过通过Fe氧化物晶格氧进行丙烷氧化脱氢，以及为什么存在过氧钒酸盐可以增强连续丙烯氧化的催化活性的原因。
