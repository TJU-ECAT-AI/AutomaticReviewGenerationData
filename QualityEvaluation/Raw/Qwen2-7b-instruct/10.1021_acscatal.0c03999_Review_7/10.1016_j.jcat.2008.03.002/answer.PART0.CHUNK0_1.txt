[1] "The role of vanadyl and peroxovanadate oxygen species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was analyzed by density functional theory (DFT)."
[2] "The ODP reaction with N2O occurred via a VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox couple, whereas both VV(d0)/VIV(d1) and VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox cycles were active with O2."
[3] "O2 was a more active oxidizing agent than N2O."
[4] "The absence of peroxovanadates may explain the superior performance of N2O compared with O2 in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species."

The document discusses the differences in performance between N2O and O2 as oxidizing agents in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over vanadium oxide catalysts. DFT calculations reveal that O2 is a more active oxidizing agent than N2O, leading to a higher degree of reduction of surface VOx species and a lower density of active oxygen species. This results in a higher selectivity for the formation of propene from propane. The document also explains that the absence of peroxovanadates might contribute to the superior performance of N2O compared to O2 in selective ODP reactions.

文档讨论了在范德华氧化催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，氮氧化物（N2O）和氧气（O2）作为氧化剂的不同性能。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算显示，氧气比氮氧化物更活跃，导致表面VOx物种的更高程度还原和活性氧物种的更低密度。这导致丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性更高。文档还解释了缺乏过氧钒酸盐可能有助于氮氧化物在选择性ODP反应中优于氧气的性能。
