Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity. The literature discusses how different oxidants, specifically O2 and N2O, impact the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the formation of vanadyl and peroxo species. N2O selectively restores vanadyl oxygen in reduced VOx species, whereas O2 can form peroxovanadates that decompose into vanadyl and oxygen, which are more reactive for propene oxidation. The absence of peroxovanadates in N2O explains its superior performance in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species. The literature highlights the role of different oxidants and their influence on the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the formation of selective and non-selective species, affecting the catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) depends on factors like catalyst reducibility, support materials, and the type of oxidant used. Specifically, N2O selectively restores vanadyl oxygen in reduced VOx species, leading to improved propene selectivity compared to O2. This is due to the formation of peroxovanadates in the presence of O2, which then decompose into vanadyl and oxygen, increasing the reactivity for propene oxidation. The absence of peroxovanadates in N2O contributes to its superior performance in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species. Understanding these dynamics helps in designing more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP by optimizing catalyst reducibility, support materials, and the choice of oxidant.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，涉及理解催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）对催化活性的影响。文献讨论了不同氧化剂（尤其是O2和N2O）对铁氧化物的还原循环以及范德里夫特和过氧物种形成的影响。N2O选择性地恢复了在还原VOx物种中范德里夫特的氧，而O2可以形成过氧范德里夫特，然后分解成范德里夫特和氧气，这增加了对丙烯的反应性。N2O在高度分散的VOx物种中选择性性能优于O2的部分原因在于其不存在过氧范德里夫特。文献强调了不同氧化剂及其对铁氧化物还原循环和过氧物种形成的动态影响，从而影响CO2-ODHP的催化活性。

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能取决于催化剂可还原性、支持材料和所用氧化剂等因素。具体而言，N2O选择性地恢复了在还原VOx物种中的范德里夫特氧，导致与使用O2相比，丙烯选择性得到显著提高。这是由于O2的存在导致形成过氧范德里夫特，然后分解成范德里夫特和氧气，增加对丙烯的反应性。N2O不存在过氧范德里夫特的事实是其在高度分散的VOx物种中选择性性能优于O2的重要因素。通过优化催化剂可还原性、支持材料和氧化剂的选择，设计更高效的催化剂来提高CO2-ODHP的性能。
