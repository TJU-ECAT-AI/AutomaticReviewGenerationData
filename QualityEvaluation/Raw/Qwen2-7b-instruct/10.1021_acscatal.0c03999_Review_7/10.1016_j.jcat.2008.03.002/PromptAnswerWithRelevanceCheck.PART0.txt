[1] "Among the catalysts for which high propene selectivity has been achieved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) are supported vanadium [13] and molybdenum oxide- based [4] materials."
[2] "But with O2 as an oxidizing agent, high propene selectivity (>80%) is observed only at low propane conversion (<2%)."
[3] "Recent studies of the ODP reaction over differently loaded VOx/γ -Al2O3 [5] and VOx/MCM-41 [6] cat- alysts have shown that propene selectivity is significantly im- proved when the reaction is performed with N2O instead of O2."
[4] "O2 was a more active oxidizing agent than N2O."
[5] "Peroxovanadates as precursors of vanadyl species were formed on reoxidation of reduced vanadium oxide species with O2, but not with N2O."
[6] "The absence of peroxovanadates may explain the superior performance of N2O compared with O2 in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species."
[7] "N2O and O2 also differ in terms of the nature of oxygen species formed on reoxidation of reduced VOx species."
[8] "N2O selectively restores vanadyl oxygen in the reduced VOx species, whereas O2 can form peroxovanadates, which then decompose into vanadyl and oxygen."
[9] "The significantly higher barriers demonstrate that N2O is a less-reactive oxidizing agent than O2."
[10] "Under these conditions, the route of COx formation via propene reaction with peroxovana- dates disappeares in the presence of N2O."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity. The literature discusses how different oxidants, specifically O2 and N2O, impact the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the formation of vanadyl and peroxo species. N2O selectively restores vanadyl oxygen in reduced VOx species, whereas O2 can form peroxovanadates that decompose into vanadyl and oxygen, which are more reactive for propene oxidation. The absence of peroxovanadates in N2O explains its superior performance in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species. The literature highlights the role of different oxidants and their influence on the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the formation of selective and non-selective species, affecting the catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) depends on factors like catalyst reducibility, support materials, and the type of oxidant used. Specifically, N2O selectively restores vanadyl oxygen in reduced VOx species, leading to improved propene selectivity compared to O2. This is due to the formation of peroxovanadates in the presence of O2, which then decompose into vanadyl and oxygen, increasing the reactivity for propene oxidation. The absence of peroxovanadates in N2O contributes to its superior performance in the selective ODP reaction over highly dispersed VOx species. Understanding these dynamics helps in designing more efficient catalysts for CO2-ODHP by optimizing catalyst reducibility, support materials, and the choice of oxidant.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，涉及理解催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）对催化活性的影响。文献讨论了不同氧化剂（尤其是O2和N2O）对铁氧化物的还原循环以及范德里夫特和过氧物种形成的影响。N2O选择性地恢复了在还原VOx物种中范德里夫特的氧，而O2可以形成过氧范德里夫特，然后分解成范德里夫特和氧气，这增加了对丙烯的反应性。N2O在高度分散的VOx物种中选择性性能优于O2的部分原因在于其不存在过氧范德里夫特。文献强调了不同氧化剂及其对铁氧化物还原循环和过氧物种形成的动态影响，从而影响CO2-ODHP的催化活性。

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能取决于催化剂可还原性、支持材料和所用氧化剂等因素。具体而言，N2O选择性地恢复了在还原VOx物种中的范德里夫特氧，导致与使用O2相比，丙烯选择性得到显著提高。这是由于O2的存在导致形成过氧范德里夫特，然后分解成范德里夫特和氧气，增加对丙烯的反应性。N2O不存在过氧范德里夫特的事实是其在高度分散的VOx物种中选择性性能优于O2的重要因素。通过优化催化剂可还原性、支持材料和氧化剂的选择，设计更高效的催化剂来提高CO2-ODHP的性能。

[1] "The role of vanadyl and peroxovanadate oxygen species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) was analyzed by density functional theory (DFT)."
[2] "The ODP reaction with N2O occurred via a VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox couple, whereas both VV(d0)/VIV(d1) and VV(d0)/VIII(d2) redox cycles were active with O2."
[3] "O2 was a more active oxidizing agent than N2O."

The document discusses the differences in performance between N2O and O2 as oxidizing agents in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) over vanadium oxide catalysts. DFT calculations reveal that O2 is a more active oxidizing agent than N2O, leading to a higher degree of reduction of surface VOx species and a lower density of active oxygen species. This results in a higher selectivity for the formation of propene from propane. The document also explains that the absence of peroxovanadates might contribute to the superior performance of N2O compared to O2 in selective ODP reactions.

文档讨论了在范德华氧化催化剂上丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，氮氧化物（N2O）和氧气（O2）作为氧化剂的不同性能。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算显示，氧气比氮氧化物更活跃，导致表面VOx物种的更高程度还原和活性氧物种的更低密度。这导致丙烷转化为丙烯的选择性更高。文档还解释了缺乏过氧钒酸盐可能有助于氮氧化物在选择性ODP反应中优于氧气的性能。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the type of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. Reducibility affects the ability of the catalyst to reduce and regenerate its active sites during the reaction. The type of support material influences the dispersion of the Fe oxide, which impacts the accessibility of reactants and products. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, as it determines the ability of the catalyst to oxidize and reduce propane efficiently.

The nature of the oxidizing agent also significantly impacts the catalytic activity. Oxygen species formed during reoxidation of reduced Fe oxide sites vary between N2O and O2. N2O can only oxidize VIII sites, while O2 can oxidize both VIII and VIV sites. The formation of a peroxovanadate precursor during reoxidation by O2 leads to a more reactive species for propene oxidation compared to vanadyl species. This explains why propene is formed primarily from propane via oxidative dehydrogenation by lattice oxygen of Fe oxide species, and why the presence of peroxovanadate enhances the catalytic activity for consecutive propene oxidation.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性的影响，以及支持材料的类型，特别是Fe2O3/AC系统。可还原性决定了催化剂在反应过程中减少和再生其活性位点的能力。支持材料的类型影响Fe氧化物的分散度，这影响了反应物和产物的可接近性。Fe氧化物的还原循环对催化活性至关重要，因为它决定了催化剂有效氧化和还原丙烷的能力。

氧化剂的性质也显著影响催化活性。在还原Fe氧化物位点期间形成的不同氧物种之间，N2O只能氧化VIII位点，而O2可以氧化VIII和VIV位点。通过O2进行再氧化时形成的过氧钒酸盐前体导致了比钒酸盐物种更活跃的物种，用于丙烯氧化。这就是为什么丙烯主要通过通过Fe氧化物晶格氧进行丙烷氧化脱氢，以及为什么存在过氧钒酸盐可以增强连续丙烯氧化的催化活性的原因。
