Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, especially those containing iron oxide (Fe2O3), play a crucial role in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Catalyst reducibility is essential because it affects the ability of the Fe oxide to undergo redox reactions, which are central to the CO2-ODHP process. When exposed to reducing conditions, Fe2O3 can reduce to lower valence states, enhancing its reactivity and thus improving catalytic activity.

Support materials, such as activated carbon (AC), significantly impact the performance of Fe oxide catalysts. The specific surface area and porosity of the support material can influence the dispersion of the active Fe oxide particles, affecting their accessibility to reactants and products. A well-dispersed catalyst ensures efficient utilization of the active sites, leading to enhanced conversion rates and product yields.

The proposed reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP involving Fe oxide catalysts includes several key steps:

1. **Reduction of Fe Oxide**: Under reducing conditions, Fe2O3 can reduce to lower valence states, such as Fe3+ or Fe2+, facilitating the adsorption of CO2 and subsequent reactions.

2. **Adsorption of CO2**: CO2 adsorbs onto the surface of the Fe oxide catalyst, forming a reactive intermediate that can participate in the subsequent chemical transformations.

3. **Formation of Fe Oxycarbide**: Upon interaction with CO2, the Fe oxide undergoes redox reactions, forming Fe oxycarbide (FeOC). This compound plays a pivotal role in the activation of propane, acting as a bridge between CO2 and the propane molecules.

4. **Activation of Propane**: The Fe oxycarbide facilitates the cleavage of C-H bonds in propane through a series of hydrogen abstraction and insertion reactions. This step is critical for the conversion of propane into smaller hydrocarbons and other products.

5. **Hydrocarbon Formation**: The cleaved C-H bonds lead to the formation of smaller hydrocarbons, such as propylene, ethylene, and methane, as well as other products like butane and benzene, depending on the reaction conditions and catalyst properties.

6. **Redox Reactions and Product Evolution**: Throughout the process, the catalyst undergoes redox cycling, with Fe returning to its oxide state upon the release of products like CO2 and H2O. This continuous redox cycle ensures sustained catalytic activity.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP is thus characterized by a dynamic interplay between reduction, adsorption, activation, and product formation, ultimately driving the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，解释催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）如何影响催化活性，并描述涉及Fe氧化物的反应机制，包括Fe氧化物的还原循环。

Fe氧化物基催化剂，尤其是含有铁氧化物（Fe2O3）的催化剂，在CO2-ODHP过程中起着关键作用。催化剂的可还原性至关重要，因为它影响Fe氧化物在进行还原反应时的能力，从而提高其活性并改善催化性能。

支持材料，如活性炭（AC），对Fe氧化物催化剂的性能产生显著影响。支持材料的特定比表面积和孔隙率可以影响活性Fe氧化物颗粒的分散，从而影响它们对反应物和产物的接触效率。良好的分散确保了活性位点的有效利用，从而提高了转化率和产品产率。

CO2-ODHP中涉及Fe氧化物催化剂的提议反应机制包含几个关键步骤：

1. **Fe氧化物的还原**：在还原条件下，Fe2O3可以还原到更低价态，如Fe3+或Fe2+，这有助于CO2的吸附和随后的化学转变，从而增强催化活性。

2. **CO2的吸附**：CO2吸附到Fe氧化物催化剂的表面，形成一个可参与后续化学转变的活性中间体。

3. **Fe氧化碳的形成**：在与CO2相互作用后，Fe氧化物经历红ox反应，形成Fe氧化碳（FeOC）。这种化合物在丙烷的活化过程中起着核心作用，作为CO2和丙烷分子之间的桥梁。

4. **丙烷的活化**：Fe氧化碳通过一系列氢提取和插入反应促进了C-H键的裂解，这是将丙烷转化为较小的烃类和其他产品的关键步骤。

5. **烃类的形成**：裂解的C-H键导致形成较小的烃类，如丙烯、乙烯和甲烷，以及其他产品如丁烷和苯，具体取决于反应条件和催化剂性质。

6. **红ox循环和产物演化**：在整个过程中，催化剂经历连续的红ox循环，其中Fe在释放CO2和水等产物后返回其氧化状态。这种持续的红ox循环确保了催化活性的持续性。

因此，Fe氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的红ox循环是通过一系列动态交互过程驱动的，包括还原、吸附、活化和产物形成，最终驱动丙烷在CO2存在的条件下氧化脱氢。
