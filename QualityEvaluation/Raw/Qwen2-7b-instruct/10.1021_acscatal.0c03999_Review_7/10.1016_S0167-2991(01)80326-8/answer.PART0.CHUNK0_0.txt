The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is characterized by their ability to efficiently convert propane into propylene, ethylene, methane, and butane. Catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play a significant role in determining catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where CO2 is utilized in the activation of propane through the formation of a Mo oxycarbide, enhancing the dehydrogenation process. The CO2-ODHP process yields propylene with a selectivity of 85-90% under temperatures ranging from 773 to 873 K, and the yield of propylene production reaches -11% at 943 K. The presence of CO2 alters the product distribution, emphasizing the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway, especially when considering the CO2/C3H8 ratio at 873 K.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能表现为有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯、乙烯、甲烷和丁烷。催化剂的可还原性和支持材料，特别是Fe2O3/AC，在确定催化活性方面起着重要作用。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中通过形成Mo氧化碳化物利用CO2激活丙烷，增强脱氢过程。CO2-ODHP过程在773至873 K的温度范围内，丙烯的选择性达到85-90%，在943 K时丙烯的产率达到-11%。当考虑873 K时的CO2/C3H8比时，CO2改变了产物分布，特别强调了氧化脱氢途径。
