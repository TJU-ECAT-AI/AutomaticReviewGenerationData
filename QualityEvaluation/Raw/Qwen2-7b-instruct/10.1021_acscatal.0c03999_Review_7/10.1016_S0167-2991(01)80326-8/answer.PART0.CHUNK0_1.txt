<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The interaction of propane with Mo2C/SiO2 at temperatures between 373-573 K led to the formation of 7r-bonded and di-o-bonded propylene, as well as propylidyne, as identified through Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
2. Mo2C/SiO2 catalysts are highly effective in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, with a selectivity to propylene of 85-90% within the temperature range of 773-873 K.
3. In addition to propylene, other hydrocarbon products such as ethylene, methane, and butane were also produced.
4. The formation of a Mo oxycarbide in the reaction between CO2 and Mo2C is believed to play a crucial role in the activation of propane.
5. The main hydrocarbon products generated during the catalytic process were propylene, ethylene, and methane.
6. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane became the predominant reaction pathway when CO2 was present.
