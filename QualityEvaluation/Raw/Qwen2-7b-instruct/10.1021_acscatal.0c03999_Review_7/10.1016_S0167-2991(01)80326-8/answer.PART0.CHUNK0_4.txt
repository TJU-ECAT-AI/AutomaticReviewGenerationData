<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), it is evident that catalyst reducibility and support materials, notably in Fe2O3/AC, significantly impact catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the proposed reaction mechanism.
