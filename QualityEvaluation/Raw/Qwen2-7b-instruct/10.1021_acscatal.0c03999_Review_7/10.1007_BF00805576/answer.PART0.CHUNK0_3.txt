[1] "The activation and dehydrogenation of CH4 on Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 have been investigated under non-oxidizing conditions."

[2] "Unsupported Mo2C exhibited very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K."

[3] "Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support somewhat enhanced its catalytic activity, but did not change the products of the reaction."

[4] "A dramatic change in the product formation occurred on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst; besides some hydrocarbons benzene was produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%."

[5] "Carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also led to a very active catalyst: the conversion of methane at the steady state was 5-6% and the selectivity of benzene formation was 85%."

The research focused on the activation and dehydrogenation of methane (CH4) on Mo2C and Mo2C supported on ZSM-5 under non-oxidizing conditions. Initially, unsupported Mo2C showed negligible activity for methane decomposition at 973 K, producing mainly hydrogen and carbon with a trace amount of ethane. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 slightly increased its catalytic activity but did not alter the products. When Mo2C was partially oxidized on ZSM-5, a significant transformation occurred, producing benzene with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Moreover, carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 resulted in an extremely active catalyst, achieving a steady-state methane conversion of 5-6% and a benzene selectivity of 85%.

研究集中在Mo2C和Mo2C在ZSM-5上的非氧化条件下对甲烷（CH4）的激活和脱氢。最初，未支持的Mo2C在973 K下表现出对甲烷分解的极低活性，主要生成氢气和碳，同时有少量乙烷。将Mo2C与ZSM-5混合仅略微提高了其催化活性，但没有改变反应产物。当Mo2C在ZSM-5上部分氧化时，发生显著变化，产生苯，选择性为70-80%，转化率为5-7%。此外，通过在ZSM-5上碳化高度分散的MoO3，得到了一个非常活跃的催化剂，在稳定状态下实现了甲烷转化率5-6%和苯选择性85%。
