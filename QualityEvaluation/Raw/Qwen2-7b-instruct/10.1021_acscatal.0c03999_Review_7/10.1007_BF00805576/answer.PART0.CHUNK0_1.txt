[1] "As shown in fig. 1 methane interacts with Mo2C at 973 K."
[2] "The reaction starts with a maximum rate, the con- version is, however, very low (0.16%), which further decreases in time."
[3] "The main gaseous product is H2."
[4] "Ethane is formed only in a very small amount."
[5] "Exposing the catalyst, free of contamination of non- carbidic carbon, to methane flow at 973 K, we obtained somewhat higher initial activity, but the general behav- ior remained the same (fig. 1)."
[6] "One possible reason for the low reactivity of Mo2C is that during its preparation excess carbon was deposited on the surface of Mo2C, which poisoned its surface."
[7] "In the next experiment the catalytic performance of Mo2C mixed with ZSM-5 was examined."
[8] "It is known that ZSM-5 is a very active catalyst in the oligomerization and aromatization of ethylene [17,18]."
[9] "The absence of a larger production of hydrocarbons suggests that methane decomposes completely to carbon."
[10] "The fact that CO was also identified among the prod- ucts suggests that the carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 was not complete during the preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5."
[11] "To overcome this problem, MOEC was produced by the carburization of 2% MoO3/ZSM-5 following the method of Lee et al. [14] (fig. 2)."
[12] "In this case we experi- enced a dramatic change in the conversion of methane and also in the product distribution."
[13] "The induction period is practically missing; the reaction starts with the highest rate."
[14] "Although a decay in the con- version occurs in this case too, the conversion at the steady state is higher (5-6%) compared to that obtained for 2 wt% MoO3/ZSM-5 under the same conditions [11,12]."
[15] "The selectivity to benzene is also higher, N 85.0%, on Mo2C/ZSM-50 and remained constant after 30 rain."
[16] "In order to explore the influence of molybdenum oxi- des, in the subsequent experiments we examined the effect of the oxidation of 2 wt% Mo2C (Aldrich) mixed with ZSM-5 support."
[17] "Based on this finding, the oxidation of Mo2C was performed in situ to different extents and the catalytic behavior of the solid so formed was tested."
[18] "Note that this sample exhibited very little activity towards methane decomposition before the oxidation (fig. 1)."
[19] "As we wanted to explore the product formation in the initial phase of the interaction of methane with the partially oxidized catalyst, the methane flow through the catalyst bed was stopped dur- ing the analysis of outlet gases."
[20] "In fig. 3 are plotted the conversion of methane and the rate of benzene formation allowing the oxidation of 1.4 wt% Mo2C/ZSM-5 to different extents."
[21] "The conversion of methane started with a maximum value on the sample oxidized to 15%."
[22] "Following a more extensive oxidation,the development of a more active catalyst required a longer contact of CH4 with the catalyst."
[23] "This feature was also exhibited in the rate of benzene formation."
[24] "The initial rate was high on the Mo2C oxidized to 15%."
[25] "A much lower rate (0.1 #mol at 2.5 min and 2.65 #tool at 4 min) was measured on the catalyst oxidized to 50%,although the conversion of methane was 8% in the latter case."
[26] "All these results suggest that, besides Mo2C, the presence of some other Mo compounds, perhaps the oxygen deficient MOO2,is also necessary for the activa- tion of methane and for the promotion of the formation of ethylene from CHx fragments."

The document discusses the conversion of methane to benzene over Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts. It highlights that unsupported Mo2C exhibits very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K, with the main reaction pathway being the decomposition of methane to give hydrogen and carbon with a trace amount of ethane. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support somewhat enhances its catalytic activity, but does not change the products of the reaction. A dramatic change in the product formation occurs on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst; besides some hydrocarbons, benzene is produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also leads to a very active catalyst, with the conversion of methane at the steady state being 5-6% and the selectivity of benzene formation being 85%.

文档讨论了Mo2C和Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂对甲烷的转化。它指出，不支持的Mo2C在973 K时表现出很少的活性，主要反应途径是甲烷分解产生氢气和碳，伴有少量乙烷。将Mo2C与ZSM-5支持混合会略微增强其催化活性，但不会改变反应产物。在部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上，产品形成发生了显著变化；除了一些烃类物质，还产生了苯，其选择性为70-80%，转化率为5-7%。高度分散的MoO3在ZSM-5上的碳化也导致了一个非常活跃的催化剂，甲烷在稳态下的转化率为5-6%，苯形成的活性为85%。
