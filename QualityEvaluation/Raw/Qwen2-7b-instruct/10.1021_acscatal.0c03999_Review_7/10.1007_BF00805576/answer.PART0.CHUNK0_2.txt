The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Catalyst reducibility affects the ability of the Fe oxide to react with CO2 and propane, facilitating the redox cycle and enhancing the conversion efficiency. Support materials, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC, play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst structure and influencing the reaction kinetics. The presence of an appropriate support can improve the dispersion of Fe2O3, leading to better access of reactants and products, and thus enhancing the overall catalytic activity.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide is a proposed reaction mechanism in CO2-ODHP. During this cycle, Fe2+ ions are reduced by CO2, forming Fe3+ ions, which then react with propane to produce CO, H2, and other hydrocarbons. The Fe3+ ions are subsequently reduced by H2 to regenerate Fe2+, completing the redox cycle. This cycle is facilitated by the support material, which helps maintain the stability of the Fe oxide species and provides a surface for the reaction to occur.

In the case of the Mo2C catalysts discussed in the document, the introduction of ZSM-5 support leads to a significant enhancement in the conversion of methane to benzene. This is attributed to the ability of ZSM-5 to facilitate the decomposition of methane into carbon and hydrogen, with a subsequent high selectivity for the formation of benzene. The partial oxidation of Mo2C further increases the catalytic activity, with the highest selectivity for benzene formation observed at the steady state of 5-6% methane conversion, reaching up to 85%.

However, it's important to note that the document does not specifically address the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, the information provided here is based on the context of the document and may not directly correlate with the requested analysis.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响。催化剂的还原性影响着Fe氧化物与二氧化碳和丙烷的反应能力，促进还原循环并提高转化效率。支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的情况下，对稳定催化剂结构和影响反应动力学至关重要。适当的支撑材料可以改善Fe2O3的分散，从而提高反应物和产物的接触效率，从而增强整体催化活性。

Fe氧化物的还原循环是CO2-ODHP的一个提议的反应机制。在此循环中，Fe2+离子通过与二氧化碳反应被还原为Fe3+离子，然后与丙烷反应产生CO、H2和其他烃类化合物。随后，Fe3+离子通过与H2反应再生为Fe2+，完成还原循环。这个循环由支持材料促进，有助于保持Fe氧化物种的稳定性，并提供反应发生的表面。

文档中讨论的Mo2C催化剂的引入ZSM-5支持导致了显著增强的甲烷到苯的转化。这归因于ZSM-5能够促进甲烷分解为碳和氢，随后高度选择性地形成苯。部分氧化Mo2C进一步提高了催化活性，在稳定的甲烷转化率为5-6%时，最高苯选择性达到85%。

然而，值得注意的是，文档没有具体涉及Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢中的性能分析。因此，提供的信息基于文档的上下文，可能不直接对应于所需分析。
