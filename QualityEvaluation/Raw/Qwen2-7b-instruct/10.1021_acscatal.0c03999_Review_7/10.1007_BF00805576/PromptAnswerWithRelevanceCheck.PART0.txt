[1] "Recently many attempts have been made to activate methane under non-oxidative conditions and to convert it into higher hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds."
[2] "In the case of supported Pt metal catalysts the dehydrogenation of methane occurred readily yielding a small amount of ethane in addition to the main products, H2 and surface carbon."
[3] "Similar studies on MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts produced more attractive results: it appeared that methane can be directly transformed to aromatic products."
[4] "Wang et al. [10] reported 100% selectivity of benzene formation at 7.2% conversion."
[5] "As the reduction of Mo 6+ to Mo 4+ proceeded during the induction period, Mo 4+ or its compounds were considered as key species in the methane conversion."
[6] "Taking into account the large amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in the course of the high temperature methane reaction, MoaC is a good candidate for the active compound."
[7] "In the present paper the interaction of CH4 is investigated with unsupported and supported MOEC under the same conditions as reported in our previous studies."
[8] "Exposing the catalyst, free of contamination of non-carbidic carbon, to methane flow at 973 K, we obtained somewhat higher initial activity, but the general behavior remained the same."
[9] "One of the reasons of the lack of improvement of the catalytic performance of MOEC mixed with ZSM-5 is the low dispersion of MOEC, and/or blocking of some of the channels in the ZSM-5."
[10] "To overcome this problem, MOEC was produced by the carburization of 2% MoO3/ZSM-5 following the method of Lee et al. [14]."
[11] "In this case we experienced a dramatic change in the conversion of methane and also in the product distribution."
[12] "The induction period is practically missing; the reaction starts with the highest rate."
[13] "Although a decay in the conversion occurs in this case too, the conversion at the steady state is higher (5-6%) compared to that obtained for 2 wt% MoO3/ZSM-5 under the same conditions."
[14] "The selectivity to benzene is also higher, N 85.0%, on Mo2C/ZSM-50 and remained constant after 30 min."
[15] "The fact that CO was also identified among the products suggests that the carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 was not complete during the preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5."
[16] "Based on this finding, the oxidation of Mo2C to MoO3 proceeds at a measurable rate at 773 K."
[17] "The conversion of methane started with a maximum value on the sample oxidized to 15%."
[18] "Following a more extensive oxidation, the development of a more active catalyst required a longer contact of CH4 with the catalyst."
[19] "This feature was also exhibited in the rate of benzene formation."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support materials. Reducibility affects the ability of Fe oxide to undergo redox reactions, which are crucial for the activation of propane and the formation of hydrocarbons. The support materials, particularly activated carbon (AC), facilitate the dispersion of Fe oxide, enhancing the accessibility of reactants and products. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then oxidized back to Fe(III), facilitating the activation of propane and the formation of hydrocarbons. The selectivity to benzene is improved when the catalyst is partially oxidized, indicating the necessity of both Fe oxide and Fe oxide compounds with an oxygen deficiency for the activation of methane and the promotion of ethylene formation from CHx fragments, which is then transformed into benzene on the acidic sites of the zeolite.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷的氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的表现涉及到铁氧化物的可还原性以及支持材料。可还原性影响铁氧化物进行还原反应的能力，这是激活丙烷和形成烃类化合物的关键。支持材料，尤其是活性炭（AC），有助于铁氧化物的分散，增强反应物和产物的可接近性。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的红ox循环，其中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，然后氧化回Fe(III)，从而促进丙烷的激活和烃类化合物的形成。当催化剂部分氧化时，苯的选择性得到改善，这表明铁氧化物和氧缺陷的FeO2复合物对于激活甲烷以及从CHx片段形成乙烷是必要的，然后在沸石的酸性位点上转化为苯。

[24] "The initial rate was high on the Mo2C oxidized to 15%."
[25] "A much lower rate (0.1 #mol at 2.5 min and 2.65 #tool at 4 min) was measured on the catalyst oxidized to 50%,although the conversion of methane was 8% in the latter case."
[26] "All these results suggest that, besides Mo2C, the presence of some other Mo compounds, perhaps the oxygen deficient MOO2,is also necessary for the activa- tion of methane and for the promotion of the formation of ethylene from CHx fragments."

The document discusses the conversion of methane to benzene over Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts. It highlights that unsupported Mo2C exhibits very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K, with the main reaction pathway being the decomposition of methane to give hydrogen and carbon with a trace amount of ethane. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support somewhat enhances its catalytic activity, but does not change the products of the reaction. A dramatic change in the product formation occurs on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst; besides some hydrocarbons, benzene is produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also leads to a very active catalyst, with the conversion of methane at the steady state being 5-6% and the selectivity of benzene formation being 85%.

文档讨论了Mo2C和Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂对甲烷的转化。它指出，不支持的Mo2C在973 K时表现出很少的活性，主要反应途径是甲烷分解产生氢气和碳，伴有少量乙烷。将Mo2C与ZSM-5支持混合会略微增强其催化活性，但不会改变反应产物。在部分氧化的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上，产品形成发生了显著变化；除了一些烃类物质，还产生了苯，其选择性为70-80%，转化率为5-7%。高度分散的MoO3在ZSM-5上的碳化也导致了一个非常活跃的催化剂，甲烷在稳态下的转化率为5-6%，苯形成的活性为85%。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Catalyst reducibility affects the ability of the Fe oxide to react with CO2 and propane, facilitating the redox cycle and enhancing the conversion efficiency. Support materials, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC, play a crucial role in stabilizing the catalyst structure and influencing the reaction kinetics. The presence of an appropriate support can improve the dispersion of Fe2O3, leading to better access of reactants and products, and thus enhancing the overall catalytic activity.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide is a proposed reaction mechanism in CO2-ODHP. During this cycle, Fe2+ ions are reduced by CO2, forming Fe3+ ions, which then react with propane to produce CO, H2, and other hydrocarbons. The Fe3+ ions are subsequently reduced by H2 to regenerate Fe2+, completing the redox cycle. This cycle is facilitated by the support material, which helps maintain the stability of the Fe oxide species and provides a surface for the reaction to occur.

In the case of the Mo2C catalysts discussed in the document, the introduction of ZSM-5 support leads to a significant enhancement in the conversion of methane to benzene. This is attributed to the ability of ZSM-5 to facilitate the decomposition of methane into carbon and hydrogen, with a subsequent high selectivity for the formation of benzene. The partial oxidation of Mo2C further increases the catalytic activity, with the highest selectivity for benzene formation observed at the steady state of 5-6% methane conversion, reaching up to 85%.

However, it's important to note that the document does not specifically address the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, the information provided here is based on the context of the document and may not directly correlate with the requested analysis.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响。催化剂的还原性影响着Fe氧化物与二氧化碳和丙烷的反应能力，促进还原循环并提高转化效率。支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的情况下，对稳定催化剂结构和影响反应动力学至关重要。适当的支撑材料可以改善Fe2O3的分散，从而提高反应物和产物的接触效率，从而增强整体催化活性。

Fe氧化物的还原循环是CO2-ODHP的一个提议的反应机制。在此循环中，Fe2+离子通过与二氧化碳反应被还原为Fe3+离子，然后与丙烷反应产生CO、H2和其他烃类化合物。随后，Fe3+离子通过与H2反应再生为Fe2+，完成还原循环。这个循环由支持材料促进，有助于保持Fe氧化物种的稳定性，并提供反应发生的表面。

文档中讨论的Mo2C催化剂的引入ZSM-5支持导致了显著增强的甲烷到苯的转化。这归因于ZSM-5能够促进甲烷分解为碳和氢，随后高度选择性地形成苯。部分氧化Mo2C进一步提高了催化活性，在稳定的甲烷转化率为5-6%时，最高苯选择性达到85%。

然而，值得注意的是，文档没有具体涉及Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷氧化脱氢中的性能分析。因此，提供的信息基于文档的上下文，可能不直接对应于所需分析。

The research focused on the activation and dehydrogenation of methane (CH4) on Mo2C and Mo2C supported on ZSM-5 under non-oxidizing conditions. Initially, unsupported Mo2C showed negligible activity for methane decomposition at 973 K, producing mainly hydrogen and carbon with a trace amount of ethane. Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 slightly increased its catalytic activity but did not alter the products. When Mo2C was partially oxidized on ZSM-5, a significant transformation occurred, producing benzene with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%. Moreover, carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 resulted in an extremely active catalyst, achieving a steady-state methane conversion of 5-6% and a benzene selectivity of 85%.
