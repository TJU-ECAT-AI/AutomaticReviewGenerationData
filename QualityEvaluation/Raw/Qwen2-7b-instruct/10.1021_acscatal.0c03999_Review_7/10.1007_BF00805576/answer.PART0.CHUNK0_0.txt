[1] "Recently many attempts have been made to activate methane under non-oxidative conditions and to convert it into higher hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds."
[2] "In the case of supported Pt metal catalysts the dehydrogenation of methane occurred readily yielding a small amount of ethane in addition to the main products, H2 and surface carbon."
[3] "Similar studies on MoO3/ZSM-5 catalysts produced more attractive results: it appeared that methane can be directly transformed to aromatic products."
[4] "Wang et al. [10] reported 100% selectivity of benzene formation at 7.2% conversion."
[5] "As the reduction of Mo 6+ to Mo 4+ proceeded during the induction period, Mo 4+ or its compounds were considered as key species in the methane conversion."
[6] "Taking into account the large amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst in the course of the high temperature methane reaction, MoaC is a good candidate for the active compound."
[7] "In the present paper the interaction of CH4 is investigated with unsupported and supported MOEC under the same conditions as reported in our previous studies."
[8] "Exposing the catalyst, free of contamination of non-carbidic carbon, to methane flow at 973 K, we obtained somewhat higher initial activity, but the general behavior remained the same."
[9] "One of the reasons of the lack of improvement of the catalytic performance of MOEC mixed with ZSM-5 is the low dispersion of MOEC, and/or blocking of some of the channels in the ZSM-5."
[10] "To overcome this problem, MOEC was produced by the carburization of 2% MoO3/ZSM-5 following the method of Lee et al. [14]."
[11] "In this case we experienced a dramatic change in the conversion of methane and also in the product distribution."
[12] "The induction period is practically missing; the reaction starts with the highest rate."
[13] "Although a decay in the conversion occurs in this case too, the conversion at the steady state is higher (5-6%) compared to that obtained for 2 wt% MoO3/ZSM-5 under the same conditions."
[14] "The selectivity to benzene is also higher, N 85.0%, on Mo2C/ZSM-50 and remained constant after 30 min."
[15] "The fact that CO was also identified among the products suggests that the carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 was not complete during the preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5."
[16] "Based on this finding, the oxidation of Mo2C to MoO3 proceeds at a measurable rate at 773 K."
[17] "The conversion of methane started with a maximum value on the sample oxidized to 15%."
[18] "Following a more extensive oxidation, the development of a more active catalyst required a longer contact of CH4 with the catalyst."
[19] "This feature was also exhibited in the rate of benzene formation."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves the reducibility of Fe oxide and the support materials. Reducibility affects the ability of Fe oxide to undergo redox reactions, which are crucial for the activation of propane and the formation of hydrocarbons. The support materials, particularly activated carbon (AC), facilitate the dispersion of Fe oxide, enhancing the accessibility of reactants and products. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then oxidized back to Fe(III), facilitating the activation of propane and the formation of hydrocarbons. The selectivity to benzene is improved when the catalyst is partially oxidized, indicating the necessity of both Fe oxide and Fe oxide compounds with an oxygen deficiency for the activation of methane and the promotion of ethylene formation from CHx fragments, which is then transformed into benzene on the acidic sites of the zeolite.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷的氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的表现涉及到铁氧化物的可还原性以及支持材料。可还原性影响铁氧化物进行还原反应的能力，这是激活丙烷和形成烃类化合物的关键。支持材料，尤其是活性炭（AC），有助于铁氧化物的分散，增强反应物和产物的可接近性。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的红ox循环，其中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，然后氧化回Fe(III)，从而促进丙烷的激活和烃类化合物的形成。当催化剂部分氧化时，苯的选择性得到改善，这表明铁氧化物和氧缺陷的FeO2复合物对于激活甲烷以及从CHx片段形成乙烷是必要的，然后在沸石的酸性位点上转化为苯。
