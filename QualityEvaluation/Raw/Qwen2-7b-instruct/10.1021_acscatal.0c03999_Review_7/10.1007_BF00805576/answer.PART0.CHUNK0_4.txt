[1] "The activation and dehydrogenation of CH4 on Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 have been investigated under non-oxidizing conditions."
[2] "Unsupported Mo2C exhibited very little activity towards methane decomposition at 973 K."
[3] "Mixing Mo2C with ZSM-5 support somewhat enhanced its catalytic activity, but did not change the products of the reaction."
[4] "A dramatic change in the product formation occurred on partially oxidized Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalyst; besides some hydrocarbons benzene was produced with a selectivity of 70-80% at a conversion of 5-7%."
[5] "Carburization of highly dispersed MoO3 on ZSM-5 also led to a very active catalyst: the conversion of methane at the steady state was 5-6% and the selectivity of benzene formation was 85%."
[6] "As we wanted to explore the product formation in the initial phase of the interaction of methane with the partially oxidized catalyst, the methane flow through the catalyst bed was stopped during the analysis of outlet gases."
[7] "The initial products were CO, CO2 and H20, which diminished to a very low level after 10 min. At the same time, the formation of various hydrocarbons including benzene became prominent."
[8] "All these results suggest that, besides Mo2C, the presence of some other Mo compounds, perhaps the oxygen deficient MOO2,is also necessary for the activation of methane and for the promotion of the formation of ethylene from CHx fragments."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not discussed in the provided literature. The focus is on the conversion of methane to benzene over Mo2C and Mo2C/ZSM-5 catalysts. There is no mention of Fe oxide-based catalysts, their reducibility, or the influence of support materials like activated carbon (AC) in the context of CO2-ODHP.

在提供的文献中，没有提到Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷的脱氢氧化（CO2-ODHP）的性能。讨论的重点是甲烷在Mo2C和Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂上的转化。没有提及Fe氧化物基催化剂、其可还原性或支持材料如活性炭（AC）在CO2-ODHP中的影响。
