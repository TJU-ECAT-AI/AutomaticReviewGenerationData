<p>The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3. Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.</p>
<p>Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species. The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.</p>
<p>Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites [7] by different methods: ionic exchange, impregnation using gallium salts in aqueous or organic media [5,8], mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 with ZSM-5 followed by thermal treatment [6], and by direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis [9,10].</p>
<p>The presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance. Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity.</p>
<p>An additional information on the nature and location of the gallium species in the Ga/(0.5) sample, following various treatments, were obtained from TPR and TG/DSC studies performed under reducing and oxidising conditions. Gallium may be present as oxide or hydroxide species deposited in the pores or at the external surface of the zeolite crystals, and/or it may occupy cationic positions in the zeolite channels.</p>
<p>No reduction of pure Ga2O3 was observed in our conditions, which agrees with a previous report of Price and Kanazirev [26] and demonstrates that the presence of acidic sites is necessary for the reduction of gallium oxide to occur.</p>
<p>The effect of a H2O2 redox cycle on calcined Ga/(0.5) was further investigated by TG/DSC. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Reduction again occurs in two steps (a shoulder at ca. 675 K and a peak at 840 K; both peaks are shifted by ca. 60 K to lower temperature due to the different operating conditions).</p>

1. The state of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites includes small GaO(OH) particles and Ga2O3 needles. After calcination, both transform into small Ga2O3 particles, remaining at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reducingoxidising cycles enable the migration of gallium species into the zeolite, enhancing its catalytic properties for propane aromatisation. Maintaining gallium in its reduced state boosts aromatic yield.

2. Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites through ionic exchange, impregnation with gallium salts, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis.

3. Highly dispersed gallium species, in synergy with zeolite acidic sites, are crucial for high catalytic performance. Reduced gallium species enhance aromatics selectivity.

4. Gallium oxide does not reduce in certain conditions, highlighting the necessity of acidic sites for gallium reduction.

5. H2O2 redox cycles on calcined Ga/(0.5) catalyst cause a two-step reduction process, shifting the peaks by about 60 K due to different operating conditions.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility allows the Fe oxide to switch between reduced and oxidized states, facilitating the redox cycle that is crucial for the reaction mechanism. The support material, in this case, activated carbon (AC), helps to stabilize the Fe oxide and provide a suitable surface area for the reaction. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the catalyst undergoes reduction to a more reactive form, followed by oxidation to regenerate the active site for the next cycle. This dynamic behavior is essential for efficient CO2-ODHP, as it allows the catalyst to maintain its activity over multiple reaction cycles.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中。可还原性使Fe氧化物在还原和氧化状态之间切换，促进了反应机制中至关重要的氧化还原循环。支持材料，在这种情况下是活化碳（AC），有助于稳定Fe氧化物并提供合适的表面面积进行反应。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，催化剂在每次循环中经历还原以形成更活泼的形式，随后氧化以再生活性位点以进行下一轮循环。这种动态行为对于高效的CO2-ODHP至关重要，因为它允许催化剂保持其活动性超过多个反应周期。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. Reducibility affects the ability of Fe oxide to participate in redox cycles, which are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), influences the dispersion and accessibility of the Fe oxide catalyst, impacting its activity and selectivity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then oxidized back to Fe(III), facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

<p>The FT-IR spectrum of the Ga/(0.5) calcined sample shows a shoulder at ca. 760 cm1 and a broad absorption band in the range 650750 cm1 compared to the spectrum of the parent H-ZSM-5 material.</p>
<p>After H2O2 treatment, both the shoulder and the broad absorption band disappeared entirely, indicating the disappearance of the Ga2O3 phase.</p>
<p>DRIFT spectra of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample in the OH stretching vibration region show that, after evacuation, three bands are observed: (i) a band at 3739 cm1 attributed to terminal SiOH groups; (ii) a band at 3606 cm1 characteristic of bridging acidic Brnsted sites [21]; and (iii) a band at 3660 cm1 which can be assigned to extra-lattice species bearing hydroxyl groups.</p>
<p>After ammonia adsorption followed by evacuation at ambient temperature, the band near 3650 cm1, was deconvoluted into two bands centred at 3660 and 3642 cm1, most probably corresponding to gallium species such as Ga(OH)2+ or Ga(OH)2+ in ion-exchange position.</p>
<p>The 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of the NH4+-form of calcined and H2O2-treated Ga/(0.5) samples are shown in Fig. 3A and B.

1. The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange exist as small GaO(OH) particles (45 nm diameter) on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, along with some large particles of Ga2O3. Upon calcination at 823 K, both are transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (45 nm diameter) at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reducing-oxidising cycles at 823 K facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite, likely as ion-exchanged Ga species, enhancing the catalytic properties for propane aromatisation.

2. The effect of treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts impacts their catalytic performance for propane aromatisation. Gallium is incorporated into zeolites through methods including ionic exchange, impregnation, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution. The study provides insights into the redox behavior of gallium species and their synergistic action with zeolite acidic sites.

3. The FT-IR spectrum of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample shows the presence of gallium species such as Ga(OH)2+ or Ga(OH)2+ in ion-exchange position after H2O2 treatment, as indicated by the disappearance of the broad absorption band at 650-750 cm−1 and the shoulder at 760 cm−1.

4. The DRIFT spectra of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample reveal bands at 3739 cm−1 (terminal SiOH groups), 3606 cm−1 (bridging acidic Brnsted sites), and 3660 cm−1 (extra-lattice species bearing hydroxyl groups). After ammonia adsorption, two bands at 3660 and 3642 cm−1 are observed, likely corresponding to gallium species in ion-exchange position.

5. The 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of the calcined and H2O2-treated Ga/(0.5) samples indicate that gallium following H2O2 treatment is not incorporated into the zeolite framework but most likely exists as ion-exchanged species.

6. The HRTEMEDX analyses of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample show needles of gallium oxide and zeolite crystals supporting micro-crystallites of Ga oxide, GaO(OH), or Ga2O3 on their external surface. The H2O2-treated sample exhibits spongy needles, suggesting the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels.

1. 在通过离子交换制备的Ga/H-ZSM-5沸石中，镓物种主要以直径为45nm的小GaO(OH)颗粒形式存在于沸石晶体表面，同时存在一些大的Ga2O3颗粒。在823K的煅烧下，它们都转变成直径为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，仍然位于沸石晶体表面。在823K的还原氧化循环中，镓物种能够迁移到沸石通道内，并且最有可能以离子交换态的形式存在，从而增强丙烷芳构化催化剂的催化性能。

2. 对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂而言，不同处理对镓状态和分布的影响对其丙烷芳构化性能产生重要影响。镓通过多种方法（包括离子交换、浸渍、机械混合和直接等同置换）被引入沸石中。研究提供了关于镓物种的还原行为及其与沸石酸性位点协同作用的见解。

3. 煅烧后的Ga/(0.5)样品的傅里叶变换红外光谱显示，在经过H2O2处理后，镓物种如Ga(OH)2+或Ga(OH)2+存在于离子交换位置，这是由650-750 cm−1范围内的宽吸收带和760 cm−1处的肩峰消失所指示的。

4. 该样品的DRIFT光谱揭示了3739 cm−1（终端SiOH基团）、3606 cm−1（桥接酸性Brnsted位点）和3660 cm−1（额外晶格上携带羟基的物种）的带。在氨吸附后，观察到两个位于3660和3642 cm−1的带，可能对应于离子交换位置的镓物种。

5. 29Si MAS-NMR谱表明，经过H2O2处理的Ga/(0.5)样品中的镓在沸石框架中并没有被整合，而是最有可能以离子交换物种的形式存在。

6. 对于煅烧后的Ga/(0.5)样品的HRTEMEDX分析显示，针状的Ga2O3和支撑微晶体的沸石晶体上存在GaO(OH)或Ga2O3。对于经过H2O2处理的样品，剩余的针状物呈海绵状，这表明镓物种确实迁移到了沸石通道内。
