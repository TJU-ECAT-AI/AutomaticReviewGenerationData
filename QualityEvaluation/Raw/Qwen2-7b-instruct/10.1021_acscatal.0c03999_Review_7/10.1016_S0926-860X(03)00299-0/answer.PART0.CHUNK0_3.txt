<p>The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques.</p>
<p>Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3.</p>
<p>Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.</p>
<p>Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species.</p>
<p>The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.</p>
<p>Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites [7] by different methods: ionic exchange, impregnation using gallium salts in aqueous or organic media [5,8], mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 with ZSM-5 followed by thermal treatment [6], and by direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis [9,10].</p>
<p>The present contribution aims at providing additional information on the effect of such treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, and their impact on catalytic performance for the aromatisation of propane.</p>
<p>The FT-IR spectrum of the Ga/(0.5) calcined sample shows a shoulder at ca. 760 cm1 and a broad absorption band in the range 650750 cm1 compared to the spectrum of the parent H-ZSM-5 material.</p>
<p>After H2O2 treatment, both the shoulder and the broad absorption band disappeared entirely, indicating the disappearance of the Ga2O3 phase.</p>
<p>DRIFT spectra of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample in the OH stretching vibration region show that, after evacuation, three bands are observed: (i) a band at 3739 cm1 attributed to terminal SiOH groups; (ii) a band at 3606 cm1 characteristic of bridging acidic Brnsted sites [21]; and (iii) a band at 3660 cm1 which can be assigned to extra-lattice species bearing hydroxyl groups.</p>
<p>After ammonia adsorption followed by evacuation at ambient temperature, the band near 3650 cm1, was deconvoluted into two bands centred at 3660 and 3642 cm1, most probably corresponding to gallium species such as Ga(OH)2+ or Ga(OH)2+ in ion-exchange position.</p>
<p>The 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of the NH4+-form of calcined and H2O2-treated Ga/(0.5) samples are shown in Fig. 3A and B. Two main signals [22] are observed centred at approximately 112 ppm corresponding to Si (4Si) and at approximately 105 ppm corresponding to Si (1T, 3Si), with T being Al, Ga or a defect site.</p>
<p>Following the procedure used by Fyfe et al. [23] who deconvoluted the 29Si NMR spectrum of a highly crystalline ZSM-5 zeolite into nine peaks corresponding to 29Si in various crystallographic sites, seven peaks were used to fit the signal observed after calcination and H2O2 treatment, as shown in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>Deconvolution of the 29Si MAS-NMR spectra permits to calculate the Si/Al ratio for the different samples [24] as shown in Table 3.</p>
<p>No reduction of pure Ga2O3 was observed in our conditions, which agrees with a previous report of Price and Kanazirev [26] and demonstrates that the presence of acidic sites is necessary for the reduction of gallium oxide to occur.</p>
<p>Quantitative determination of the total H2 consumption shows that Ga3+ is nearly totally reduced to Ga+ in all cases.</p>
<p>HRTEMEDX analyses show that the distribution of the Ga species in the dried, calcined, and H2O2-treated samples was further investigated by HRTEMEDX.</p>
<p>The HRTEM picture and EDX analyses of calcined Ga/(0.5) show needles of gallium oxide (0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) and zeolite crystals of a few m supporting micro-crystallites (diameter = 45 nm) of Ga oxide, GaO(OH) or Ga2O3, on their external surface.</p>
<p>Most of the needles have disappeared and those remaining appear spongy in the H2O2-treated sample, suggesting that migration of Ga species into the zeolite channels has indeed occurred.</p>

1. The gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange exist as small GaO(OH) particles (45 nm diameter) on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, along with some large particles of Ga2O3. Upon calcination at 823 K, both are transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (45 nm diameter) at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reducing-oxidising cycles at 823 K facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite, likely as ion-exchanged Ga species, enhancing the catalytic properties for propane aromatisation.

2. The effect of treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts impacts their catalytic performance for propane aromatisation. Gallium is incorporated into zeolites through methods including ionic exchange, impregnation, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution. The study provides insights into the redox behavior of gallium species and their synergistic action with zeolite acidic sites.

3. The FT-IR spectrum of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample shows the presence of gallium species such as Ga(OH)2+ or Ga(OH)2+ in ion-exchange position after H2O2 treatment, as indicated by the disappearance of the broad absorption band at 650-750 cm−1 and the shoulder at 760 cm−1.

4. The DRIFT spectra of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample reveal bands at 3739 cm−1 (terminal SiOH groups), 3606 cm−1 (bridging acidic Brnsted sites), and 3660 cm−1 (extra-lattice species bearing hydroxyl groups). After ammonia adsorption, two bands at 3660 and 3642 cm−1 are observed, likely corresponding to gallium species in ion-exchange position.

5. The 29Si MAS-NMR spectra of the calcined and H2O2-treated Ga/(0.5) samples indicate that gallium following H2O2 treatment is not incorporated into the zeolite framework but most likely exists as ion-exchanged species.

6. The HRTEMEDX analyses of the calcined Ga/(0.5) sample show needles of gallium oxide and zeolite crystals supporting micro-crystallites of Ga oxide, GaO(OH), or Ga2O3 on their external surface. The H2O2-treated sample exhibits spongy needles, suggesting the migration of gallium species into the zeolite channels.

1. 在通过离子交换制备的Ga/H-ZSM-5沸石中，镓物种主要以直径为45nm的小GaO(OH)颗粒形式存在于沸石晶体表面，同时存在一些大的Ga2O3颗粒。在823K的煅烧下，它们都转变成直径为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，仍然位于沸石晶体表面。在823K的还原氧化循环中，镓物种能够迁移到沸石通道内，并且最有可能以离子交换态的形式存在，从而增强丙烷芳构化催化剂的催化性能。

2. 对于Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂而言，不同处理对镓状态和分布的影响对其丙烷芳构化性能产生重要影响。镓通过多种方法（包括离子交换、浸渍、机械混合和直接等同置换）被引入沸石中。研究提供了关于镓物种的还原行为及其与沸石酸性位点协同作用的见解。

3. 煅烧后的Ga/(0.5)样品的傅里叶变换红外光谱显示，在经过H2O2处理后，镓物种如Ga(OH)2+或Ga(OH)2+存在于离子交换位置，这是由650-750 cm−1范围内的宽吸收带和760 cm−1处的肩峰消失所指示的。

4. 该样品的DRIFT光谱揭示了3739 cm−1（终端SiOH基团）、3606 cm−1（桥接酸性Brnsted位点）和3660 cm−1（额外晶格上携带羟基的物种）的带。在氨吸附后，观察到两个位于3660和3642 cm−1的带，可能对应于离子交换位置的镓物种。

5. 29Si MAS-NMR谱表明，经过H2O2处理的Ga/(0.5)样品中的镓在沸石框架中并没有被整合，而是最有可能以离子交换物种的形式存在。

6. 对于煅烧后的Ga/(0.5)样品的HRTEMEDX分析显示，针状的Ga2O3和支撑微晶体的沸石晶体上存在GaO(OH)或Ga2O3。对于经过H2O2处理的样品，剩余的针状物呈海绵状，这表明镓物种确实迁移到了沸石通道内。
