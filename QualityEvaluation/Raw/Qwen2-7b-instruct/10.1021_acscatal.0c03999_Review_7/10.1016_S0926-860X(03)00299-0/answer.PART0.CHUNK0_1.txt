[1] "The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques."
[2] "The present contribution aims at providing additional information on the effect of such treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, and their impact on catalytic performance for the aromatisation of propane."
[3] "Reductionoxidising cycles at 823 K promote the migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels where highly dispersed cationic Ga species are stabilised in ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely Ga(OH)2+ species."
[4] "From a catalytic viewpoint, the presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance. Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility allows the Fe oxide to switch between reduced and oxidized states, facilitating the redox cycle that is crucial for the reaction mechanism. The support material, in this case, activated carbon (AC), helps to stabilize the Fe oxide and provide a suitable surface area for the reaction. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the catalyst undergoes reduction to a more reactive form, followed by oxidation to regenerate the active site for the next cycle. This dynamic behavior is essential for efficient CO2-ODHP, as it allows the catalyst to maintain its activity over multiple reaction cycles.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中。可还原性使Fe氧化物在还原和氧化状态之间切换，促进了反应机制中至关重要的氧化还原循环。支持材料，在这种情况下是活化碳（AC），有助于稳定Fe氧化物并提供合适的表面面积进行反应。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，催化剂在每次循环中经历还原以形成更活泼的形式，随后氧化以再生活性位点以进行下一轮循环。这种动态行为对于高效的CO2-ODHP至关重要，因为它允许催化剂保持其活动性超过多个反应周期。
