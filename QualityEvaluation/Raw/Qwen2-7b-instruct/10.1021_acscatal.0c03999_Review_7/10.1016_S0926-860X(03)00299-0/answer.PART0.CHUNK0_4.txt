<p>The present contribution aims at providing additional information on the effect of such treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, and their impact on catalytic performance for the aromatisation of propane.</p>
<p>Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites by different methods: ionic exchange, impregnation using gallium salts in aqueous or organic media, mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 with ZSM-5 followed by thermal treatment, and by direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis.</p>
<p>The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3.</p>
<p>Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.</p>
<p>Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species.</p>
<p>From a catalytic viewpoint, the presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance.</p>
<p>Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity.</p>
<p>The latter is probably the case when the process is operated at high conversion, i.e. in conditions where ample hydrogen, as a product, is available such that Ga should be kept in a reduced state.</p>

1. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of different treatments on the state and dispersion of gallium in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, particularly regarding their effectiveness in propane aromatization.

2. Gallium can be introduced into zeolites through ionic exchange, impregnation with gallium salts, mechanical mixing with ZSM-5 followed by thermal treatment, or direct substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis.

3. After ion-exchange, gallium species are initially found as small GaO(OH) particles (45 nm diameter) at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, alongside larger Ga2O3 particles (0.5-1.5 m long and 0.1-0.2 m wide).

4. Upon calcination at 823 K, the GaO(OH) particles transform into smaller Ga2O3 particles (45 nm diameter) at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the larger Ga2O3 needles largely disappear.

5. Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K facilitate the migration of gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species.

6. The presence of highly dispersed gallium species in the zeolite framework, in synergy with the zeolite's acidic sites, is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance.

7. Keeping gallium species in their reduced state enhances aromatic selectivity, especially when operating at high conversion conditions where ample hydrogen is available as a product.

1. 本研究旨在探讨不同处理对Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中镓状态和分布的影响，特别是对于丙烷芳构化的效果。

2. 镓可以通过离子交换、含镓盐的水溶液或有机介质浸渍、机械混合Ga2O3与ZSM-5后热处理，或者在合成过程中直接代替Si进行等晶型置换的方法引入到沸石中。

3. 在离子交换后，镓物种最初以直径为45nm的小GaO(OH)颗粒形式存在于沸石晶体的外表面，还存在较大的Ga2O3颗粒（长度0.5-1.5 m，宽度0.1-0.2 m）。

4. 在823 K的煅烧下，GaO(OH)颗粒转化为直径为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，仍然位于沸石晶体的外表面，而较大的Ga2O3针状体几乎完全消失。

5. 在823 K的还原氧化循环中，可以促进镓物种向沸石内部迁移，最有可能是以离子交换形式的镓物种。

6. 高分散的镓物种在沸石框架中的存在，与沸石酸性位点协同作用，是实现高催化性能的关键。

7. 将镓物种保持在还原态状态可以增强芳香选择性，特别是在高转化率条件下操作时，此时有足够的氢作为产物存在。
