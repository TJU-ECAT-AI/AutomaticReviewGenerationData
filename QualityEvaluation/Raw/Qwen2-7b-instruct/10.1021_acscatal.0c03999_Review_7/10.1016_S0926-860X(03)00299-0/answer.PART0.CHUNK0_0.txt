<p>The state and local environment of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by ion-exchange have been identified by various techniques. Small GaO(OH) particles (diameter 45 nm) were present after synthesis at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals together with some isolated large particles (needles 0.51.5 m long and 0.10.2 m wide) of Ga2O3. Upon calcination at 823 K both were transformed into small Ga2O3 particles (diameter 45 nm), still at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals, while the needles disappeared almost completely.</p>
<p>Reducingoxidising cycles at 823 K enable the migration of these gallium species into the zeolite, most likely as ion-exchanged Ga species. The latter enhance the bifunctional (dehydrogenating and acidic) catalytic properties of the Ga-modified zeolite for the aromatisation of propane and it appears that maintaining those in the GaI oxidation state may enhance the aromatic yield.</p>
<p>Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites [7] by different methods: ionic exchange, impregnation using gallium salts in aqueous or organic media [5,8], mechanical mixing of Ga2O3 with ZSM-5 followed by thermal treatment [6], and by direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis [9,10].</p>
<p>The presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance. Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity.</p>
<p>An additional information on the nature and location of the gallium species in the Ga/(0.5) sample, following various treatments, were obtained from TPR and TG/DSC studies performed under reducing and oxidising conditions. Gallium may be present as oxide or hydroxide species deposited in the pores or at the external surface of the zeolite crystals, and/or it may occupy cationic positions in the zeolite channels.</p>
<p>No reduction of pure Ga2O3 was observed in our conditions, which agrees with a previous report of Price and Kanazirev [26] and demonstrates that the presence of acidic sites is necessary for the reduction of gallium oxide to occur.</p>
<p>The effect of a H2O2 redox cycle on calcined Ga/(0.5) was further investigated by TG/DSC. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Reduction again occurs in two steps (a shoulder at ca. 675 K and a peak at 840 K; both peaks are shifted by ca. 60 K to lower temperature due to the different operating conditions).</p>

1. The state of gallium species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolites includes small GaO(OH) particles and Ga2O3 needles. After calcination, both transform into small Ga2O3 particles, remaining at the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. Reducingoxidising cycles enable the migration of gallium species into the zeolite, enhancing its catalytic properties for propane aromatisation. Maintaining gallium in its reduced state boosts aromatic yield.

2. Gallium can be incorporated into zeolites through ionic exchange, impregnation with gallium salts, mechanical mixing, and direct isomorphous substitution of Ga for Si during synthesis.

3. Highly dispersed gallium species, in synergy with zeolite acidic sites, are crucial for high catalytic performance. Reduced gallium species enhance aromatics selectivity.

4. Gallium oxide does not reduce in certain conditions, highlighting the necessity of acidic sites for gallium reduction.

5. H2O2 redox cycles on calcined Ga/(0.5) catalyst cause a two-step reduction process, shifting the peaks by about 60 K due to different operating conditions.

1. 铟在Ga/H-ZSM-5沸石中的状态包括小的GaO(OH)颗粒和Ga2O3针。在煅烧后，两者都转化为直径为45nm的小Ga2O3颗粒，仍位于沸石晶体的外表面。还原氧化周期使镓物种迁移到沸石中，增强其丙烷芳构化催化剂的催化性能。保持镓物种在GaI氧化态可以增加芳香产物的产率。

2. 铟可以通过离子交换、使用镓盐的浸渍、机械混合和直接将镓替换为硅进行合成期间的等离子替代方法被引入沸石。

3. 高分散的镓物种与沸石酸性位点协同作用对于实现高催化性能至关重要。还原的镓物种增强了芳香产物的选择性。

4. 在某些条件下，镓氧化物不会减少，强调了酸性位点对于镓还原的必要性。

5. H2O2还原氧化循环对煅烧后的Ga/(0.5)催化剂导致两步还原过程，由于不同的操作条件，峰向较低温度偏移约60 K。
