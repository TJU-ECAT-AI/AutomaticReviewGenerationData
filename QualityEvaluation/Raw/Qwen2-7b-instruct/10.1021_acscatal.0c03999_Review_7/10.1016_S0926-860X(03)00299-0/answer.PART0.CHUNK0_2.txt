<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 following Ga ion-exchange and drying at 293 K contains mostly GaO(OH) small particles (diameter = 45 nm) located on the external surface of the zeolite crystallites, a few Ga cationic species in ion-exchange position and some large crystallites of gallium oxide.</p>
<p>Upon calcination, GaO(OH) small particles are transformed into Ga2O3 particles of comparable size also located at the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites.</p>
<p>Reductionoxidation cycles at 823 K promote the migration of gallium inside the zeolite channels where highly dispersed cationic Ga species are stabilised in ion-exchange position as Ga+, GaO+, and less likely Ga(OH)2+ species.</p>
<p>The presence of highly dispersed Ga species in the zeolite framework, acting in synergy with the zeolite acidic sites, is paramount to achieving high performance.</p>
<p>Maintaining Ga species in their reduced state enhances aromatics selectivity.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. Reducibility affects the ability of Fe oxide to participate in redox cycles, which are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), influences the dispersion and accessibility of the Fe oxide catalyst, impacting its activity and selectivity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then oxidized back to Fe(III), facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。可还原性影响Fe氧化物参与氧化还原循环的能力，这是氧化脱氢过程的关键。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），影响Fe氧化物催化剂的分散和可接近性，影响其活性和选择性。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，然后氧化回Fe(III)，在二氧化碳的存在下促进丙烷的氧化脱氢。
