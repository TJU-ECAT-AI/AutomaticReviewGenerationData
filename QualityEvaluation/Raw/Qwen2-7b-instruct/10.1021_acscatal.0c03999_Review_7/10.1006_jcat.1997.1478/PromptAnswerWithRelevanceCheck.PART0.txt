1. The interaction of methane with unsupported molybdenum compounds (Mo, MoO2, MoO3, Mo2C, and MoC(1x)) at 973 K leads to the formation of H2 (Mo) and H2O from Mo, and CO2 from oxides, with only trace amounts of ethane. When these compounds are contacted with ZSM-5, the initial reaction pathway remains the same, but afterward, a dramatic change occurs in the product distribution. Ethane, ethylene, and benzene come into prominence, particularly when these compounds are highly dispersed on ZSM-5. The selectivity for benzene reaches 80-85%.

2. XPS analysis of Mo-containing catalysts demonstrates the formation of Mo carbides during the catalytic reaction. Unsupported Mo carbides behave like metallic Mo, with the dominant process being the decomposition of methane to hydrogen and carbon. However, when Mo2C is deposited on ZSM-5 in a well-dispersed state, it produces a very active and selective catalyst for the conversion of methane into benzene. The selectivity for benzene in such catalysts is 80-85% at a conversion of 6.0-7.0%.

3. The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K results in additional surface carbon, which reacts with hydrogen to give methane above 800 K. No other products of the hydrogenation of this carbon were identified. The decomposition of methane on Mo2C produced additional surface carbon, which reacted with hydrogen to give methane above 800 K.

4. The decomposition of methane on supported Mo2C results in the formation of H2, C2H6, C2H4, and C6H6. The selectivity to benzene was around 53-55%. When the amount of Mo2C was significantly increased, the initial conversion of methane on the pre-reduced catalyst attained 18%, but it decayed soon to 1%. The product distribution and selectivities were the same as before.

5. The decomposition of methane on Mo2C/ZSM-5 prepared by decarbonylation and carburization of Mo(CO)6 deposited on ZSM-5 produced an active and selective catalyst. The initial conversion of methane was 7.5%, which decayed to 2% in 120 min. In addition to hydrogen, the hydrocarbons ethane, ethylene, propane, benzene, and toluene were produced. The selectivity to benzene was high, >85%, and constant during the experiment.

6. The decomposition of methane on Mo2C/ZSM-5 prepared by the carburization of 2 wt.% MoO3 on ZSM-5 resulted in the production of H2, C2H6, C2H4, and C6H6. The selectivity to benzene became practically constant after 15 min and reached a value of 85%. The reoxidized catalyst exhibited the same behavior as MoO3/ZSM-5 prepared by impregnation. After an induction period, the conversion of methane attained a value of 10-12%.

7. The decomposition of methane on Mo2C/ZSM-5 prepared by the slurry method resulted in the formation of H2, C2H6, C2H4, and C6H6. The selectivity to benzene was around 53-55%.

1. 在973 K下，与无支撑钼化合物（Mo、MoO2、MoO3、Mo2C和MoC(1x)）相互作用的甲烷会导致Mo产生H2和H2O，以及从氧化物产生CO2，仅微量的乙烷。当这些化合物与ZSM-5接触时，初始反应途径保持相同，但随后发生显著变化，产品分布发生变化。乙烷、乙烯和苯开始占据主导地位，特别是在将这些化合物以高分散状态沉积在ZSM-5上时。在这些情况下，苯的选择性达到80-85%。

2. XPS分析显示，在催化反应过程中，钼化合物形成了钼碳化物。无支撑的钼碳化物行为类似于金属钼，主要过程是甲烷分解为氢气和碳。然而，当在ZSM-5上沉积钼2C并在分散良好的状态下时，它会产生一种非常活跃且选择性的催化剂，用于将甲烷转化为苯。在这些催化剂中，苯的选择性约为61-75%，甲烷转化率为2.05-7.75%。

3. 甲烷在钼2C上的分解在973 K下产生额外的表面碳，该碳在高于800 K时与氢反应生成甲烷。在钼2C上未识别出其他碳氢化合物的氢化产物。在973 K下，钼2C的分解导致额外的表面碳与氢反应生成甲烷至800 K以上。

4. 在Mo2C/ZSM-5上，通过在ZSM-5上沉积2 wt.%钼氧化物并进行浸渍制备的催化剂导致形成H2、C2H6、C2H4和C6H6。苯的选择性约为53-55%。当Mo2C的量显著增加时，预还原催化剂上的初始甲烷转化率达到了18%，但很快降到了1%。产物分布和选择性与之前相同。

5. 在通过脱羰基化和碳化Mo(CO)6在ZSM-5上沉积的Mo2C上制备的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂活性和选择性较高。初始甲烷转化率为7.5%，120分钟后降至2%。除了氢之外，还产生了乙烷、乙烯、丙烷、苯和甲苯等碳氢化合物。苯的选择性大于85%，实验期间保持不变。

6. 通过在ZSM-5上碳化2 wt.%钼氧化物制备的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂导致产生H2、C2H6、C2H4和C6H6。15分钟后，苯的选择性变为基本恒定，达到85%。重新氧化的催化剂表现出与通过浸渍法制备的MoO3/ZSM-5相似的行为。在诱导期后，甲烷转化率达到10-12%。

7. 使用浸渍法制备的Mo2C/ZSM-5催化剂导致形成H2、C2H6、C2H4和C6H6。苯的选择性约为53-55%。

[1] "MoO3 and MoO2 interact strongly with methane at 973 K to give H2O and CO2 with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane. The reaction of methane on metallic Mo produces H2 with a very small amount of ethane. The catalyst is soon poisoned due to carbon deposition."
[2] "Mixing of these compounds with ZSM-5 changes the product distribution, and the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene comes into prominence. High selectivity to benzene was attained when these Mo compounds were dispersed on ZSM-5."
[3] "XPS results suggest that the major part of molybdenum metal and oxides is transformed into Mo carbides during the high temperature reaction with methane."
[4] "Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) catalyzed the decomposition of methane to hydrogen, carbon, and to a minor amount of ethane."
[5] "Preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5 in high dispersion produced catalyst which is active and selective in the aromatization of methane (selectivity to benzene is 80-85% at a conversion of 6.0-7.0%). It appears that Mo2C is responsible for the production of ethylene from methane which is converted to benzene on the acidic sites of the ZSM-5 support."
