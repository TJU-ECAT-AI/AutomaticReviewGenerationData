[1] "The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K produced additional surface carbon, which reacted with hydrogen to give methane above 800 K. No other products of the hydrogenation of this carbon were identified."
[2] "The decomposition of methane on Mo2C at 973 K led to the formation of H2, C2H6, and a small amount of C2H4. The C2Hx/H2 ratio varied between 2.8 × 104 and 6.5 × 104."
[3] "When the amount of Mo2C was significantly increased (the Mo2C/ZSM-5 weight ratio was 1 : 2), we observed similar picture. The initial conversion of methane on the pre-reduced catalyst attained 18%, but it decayed soon to 1%."

1. The reaction of methane on Mo2C resulted in the production of additional surface carbon, which upon hydrogenation at temperatures above 800 K, returned to methane. No other hydrogenation products were detected.

2. At 973 K, the decomposition of methane on Mo2C led to the formation of H2, C2H6, and a small amount of C2H4. The ratio of C2Hx to H2 ranged from 2.8 × 104 to 6.5 × 104.

3. Increasing the amount of Mo2C to 1:2 with ZSM-5 led to an initial methane conversion of 18% on the catalyst. However, this quickly dropped to 1% after a short time.

1. 在Mo2C上甲烷的反应产生了额外的表面碳，在800 K以上的温度下，通过氢化返回为甲烷。没有检测到其他氢化产物。

2. 在973 K时，甲烷在Mo2C上的分解产生了H2、C2H6和少量的C2H4。C2Hx与H2的比例从2.8×104到6.5×104。

3. 将Mo2C量增加到与ZSM-5的比例为1：2后，预还原催化剂的初始甲烷转化率达到了18%，但很快降至1%。
