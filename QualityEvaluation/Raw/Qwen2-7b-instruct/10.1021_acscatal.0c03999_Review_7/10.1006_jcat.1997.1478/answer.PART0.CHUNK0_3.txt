[1] "MoO3 and MoO2 interact strongly with methane at 973 K to give H2O and CO2 with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane. The reaction of methane on metallic Mo produces H2 with a very small amount of ethane. The catalyst is soon poisoned due to carbon deposition."
[2] "Mixing of these compounds with ZSM-5 changes the product distribution, and the formation of ethylene, ethane, and benzene comes into prominence. High selectivity to benzene was attained when these Mo compounds were dispersed on ZSM-5."
[3] "XPS results suggest that the major part of molybdenum metal and oxides is transformed into Mo carbides during the high temperature reaction with methane."
[4] "Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) catalyzed the decomposition of methane to hydrogen, carbon, and to a minor amount of ethane."
[5] "Preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5 in high dispersion produced catalyst which is active and selective in the aromatization of methane (selectivity to benzene is 80-85% at a conversion of 6.0-7.0%). It appears that Mo2C is responsible for the production of ethylene from methane which is converted to benzene on the acidic sites of the ZSM-5 support."

1. MoO3 and MoO2 react strongly with methane at 973 K to produce H2O and CO2, along with trace amounts of ethylene and ethane. When metallic Mo reacts with methane, it yields H2 with a minimal amount of ethane. The catalyst becomes poisoned due to carbon deposition.
2. Mixing these compounds with ZSM-5 alters the product distribution, with ethylene, ethane, and benzene becoming prominent products. High selectivity for benzene is achieved when these Mo compounds are dispersed on ZSM-5.
3. XPS analysis indicates that the majority of molybdenum metal and oxides are converted into Mo carbides during high-temperature reactions with methane.
4. Unsupported Mo2C and MoC(1x) facilitate the decomposition of methane into hydrogen, carbon, and a small amount of ethane.
5. Preparation of Mo2C on ZSM-5 in high dispersion creates an active and selective catalyst for the aromatization of methane, with a selectivity to benzene of 80-85% at a 6.0-7.0% conversion. Mo2C is responsible for producing ethylene from methane, which is then converted to benzene on the acidic sites of the ZSM-5 support.

1. 在973 K时，MoO3和MoO2与甲烷强烈反应生成H2O和CO2，以及微量的乙烯和乙烷。当金属Mo与甲烷反应时，它产生H2和少量的乙烷。催化剂由于碳沉积而中毒。
2. 将这些化合物与ZSM-5混合改变了产物分布，乙烷、乙烯和苯开始成为主要产物。在Mo化合物分散在ZSM-5上时，可以实现高选择性苯的形成。
3. XPS结果表明，在高温下与甲烷反应时，大部分钼金属和氧化物转化为Mo碳化物。
4. 未支持的Mo2C和MoC(1x)催化甲烷分解为氢气、碳和少量乙烷。
5. 将Mo2C在ZSM-5上高分散制备产生活性和选择性的催化剂用于甲烷的芳香化，苯的选择性为80-85%，转化率为6.0-7.0%。Mo2C负责从甲烷产生乙烯，然后在ZSM-5的支持酸性位点上将其转化为苯。
