The study analyzed the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). It was found that catalyst reducibility and support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC, had a substantial impact on the catalytic activity. A suggested reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide was also presented.
