<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials used, especially in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the proposed reaction mechanism for this process.
