The study examined the impact of cerium oxide catalyst morphology on the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene. It was discovered that catalyst reducibility and the support material, especially in the context of Fe2O3/AC, significantly affect catalytic efficiency. A suggested reaction pathway involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide was also presented.
