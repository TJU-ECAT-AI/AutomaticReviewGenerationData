[1] "We find that the high-surface-area ceria prepared by the template-assisted synthesis method exhibits higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield at low temperatures (400500 C) than commercial ceria nanoparticles."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The high-surface-area ceria, synthesized using a template-assisted method, demonstrated higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield at low temperatures (400-500 C) compared to commercial ceria nanoparticles.

[1] "We conclude that the ethylbenzene ODH reaction with CO2 over ceria by the two-step pathway must occur."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We conclude that the ethylbenzene oxidative dehydrogenation reaction with CO2 over ceria follows a two-step pathway.

[1] "We have found it is easy for styrene to polymerize and form polystyrene, whereas polystyrene was also able to decompose to styrene monomers in the temperature range of 200450 C, but at temperatures above 500 C, the polystyrene further dehydrogenated to produce coke (reaction 9)."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
We've determined that styrene readily polymerizes to form polystyrene. Polystyrene can also revert to styrene monomers within the temperature range of 200-450 C. However, at temperatures above 500 C, polystyrene further dehydrogenates to form coke (reaction 9).
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
我们发现，苯乙烯容易聚合形成聚苯乙烯。聚苯乙烯也能在200-450 C的温度范围内转化为苯乙烯单体。然而，当温度高于500 C时，聚苯乙烯进一步脱氢生成焦炭（反应9）。

[1] "In contrast, no significant coking was observed in the presence of CO2 during the ODH reaction over HSA-CeO2 at high temperature (Figure 10), which indicates that CO2 helps inhibit deposition of coke on the catalyst."
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Contrary to observations, no notable coke formation was detected during the ODH reaction over high-surface-area ceria in the presence of CO2 at high temperatures (Figure 10), suggesting that CO2 assists in preventing coke accumulation on the catalyst.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
<ChineseVersionAnswer>
相反，在高表面面积铈氧化物上进行ODH反应，并且在高温下存在CO2的情况下（图10），未观察到明显的结焦现象，这表明CO2有助于防止催化剂上的结焦沉积。
