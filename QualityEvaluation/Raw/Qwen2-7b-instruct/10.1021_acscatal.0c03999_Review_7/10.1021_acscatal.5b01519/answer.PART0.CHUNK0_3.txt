[1] "The catalyst reducibility plays a critical role in the activity of the Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP)."
[2] "The support material, particularly in the case of Fe2O3/AC, can also significantly influence the catalytic activity."
[3] "A proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide suggests that during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the Fe oxide is first reduced by the propane, forming Fe2+. The Fe2+ then reacts with CO2 to form FeCO3, which is subsequently oxidized back to Fe3+, completing the redox cycle."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), it is observed that catalyst reducibility and the support material, especially in the context of Fe2O3/AC, significantly impact catalytic activity. A proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide explains the process as follows: Initially, the Fe oxide is reduced by propane, transforming into Fe2+. Subsequently, Fe2+ reacts with CO2 to form FeCO3. Lastly, FeCO3 is oxidized back to Fe3+, completing the redox cycle.

在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能分析表明，催化剂还原性和支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的情况下，对催化活性有显著影响。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环解释过程如下：首先，铁氧化物由丙烷还原，转化为Fe2+。随后，Fe2+与CO2反应形成FeCO3。最后，FeCO3被氧化回Fe3+，完成氧化还原循环。
