The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. The reducibility allows the Fe oxide to facilitate the redox reactions necessary for the dehydrogenation process. The support material, in this case, activated carbon (AC), provides a surface for the Fe oxide and helps in stabilizing the catalyst under reaction conditions. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) during the dehydrogenation step, and subsequently oxidized back to Fe(III) in the presence of CO2, which facilitates the removal of hydrogen atoms from the propane molecule. This redox cycle is crucial for the efficient dehydrogenation process in CO2-ODHP.

The presence of CO2 as an oxidant in the CO2-ODHP process plays a dual role. Firstly, it enhances the reaction rate and styrene yield by acting as a soft oxidant. Secondly, it helps mitigate the coke deposition during the reaction, which is a common issue in dehydrogenation processes. This is achieved by oxidizing the coke formed on the catalyst surface, thereby regenerating the catalyst and preventing its deactivation. The coke is likely formed from the polymerization of styrene, which is a byproduct of the dehydrogenation reaction. The oxidation of coke by CO2 opens up the catalyst surface, restoring its activity and improving the overall efficiency of the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到Fe氧化物可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。可还原性允许Fe氧化物促进所需还原反应的过程。支持材料，在这种情况下是活化碳（AC），为Fe氧化物提供表面，并在反应条件下帮助稳定催化剂。提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，其中Fe(III)在脱氢步骤中被还原为Fe(II)，随后在CO2的存在下重新氧化为Fe(III)，这有助于从丙烷分子中移除氢原子。这个还原循环对于高效进行CO2-ODHP过程至关重要。

在CO2-ODHP过程中CO2作为氧化剂的作用是双管齐下的。首先，它通过充当软氧化剂来增强反应速率和苯乙烯产率。其次，它有助于缓解反应期间的焦炭沉积问题，这是脱氢过程中常见的问题。这是通过氧化催化剂表面上形成的焦炭实现的，从而再生催化剂并防止其失活。焦炭可能由脱氢反应的副产品苯乙烯聚合形成。CO2对焦炭的氧化打开催化剂表面，恢复其活性并提高CO2-ODHP过程的整体效率。
