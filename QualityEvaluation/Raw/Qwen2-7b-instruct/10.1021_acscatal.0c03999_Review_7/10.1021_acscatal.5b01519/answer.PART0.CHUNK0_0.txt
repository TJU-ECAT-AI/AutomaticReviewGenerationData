[1] "Good performance for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene has been reported for a solid catalyst containing vanadium as an active component, wherein CO2 serves as oxidant and without steam."
[2] "Others also reported that the enhancement effects of the dehydrogenation activity of ethylbenzene were significant with CO2 in the presence of Fe2O3/Al2O3, (21) MnO2ZrO2, (22) and a SBA-15-supported CeO2ZrO2 catalyst. (23)"
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the coke deposition can be effectively removed via oxidation with CO2."
[4] "In the absence of CO2, the produced polystyrene transforms into graphite-like coke at temperatures above 500 C, which leads to catalyst deactivation."

1. Solid catalysts containing vanadium, with CO2 as the oxidant and no steam, have demonstrated excellent performance in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.
2. CO2 has been reported to significantly enhance the dehydrogenation activity of ethylbenzene when used with Fe2O3/Al2O3, MnO2ZrO2, and a SBA-15-supported CeO2ZrO2 catalyst.
3. CO2 facilitates the removal of coke deposits from the catalyst surface through oxidation, thus preventing catalyst deactivation.
4. Without CO2, the polymerized polystyrene transforms into graphite-like coke at temperatures above 500°C, leading to catalyst inactivation.

1. 含有钒的固体催化剂，使用CO2作为氧化剂且不使用蒸汽，在乙苯脱氢反应中表现出优异性能。
2. CO2被报道能够显著增强Fe2O3/Al2O3、MnO2ZrO2和SBA-15支持的CeO2ZrO2催化剂在乙苯脱氢过程中的活性。
3. CO2通过氧化作用有效移除催化剂表面的焦炭沉积物，防止催化剂失效。
4. 在没有CO2的情况下，聚合的聚苯乙烯在温度高于500°C时转化为类似石墨的焦炭，导致催化剂失效。
