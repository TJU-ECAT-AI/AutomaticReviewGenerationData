The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. The reducibility allows the Fe oxide to facilitate the redox reactions necessary for the dehydrogenation process. The support material, in this case, activated carbon (AC), provides a surface for the Fe oxide and helps in stabilizing the catalyst under reaction conditions. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) during the dehydrogenation step, and subsequently oxidized back to Fe(III) in the presence of CO2, which facilitates the removal of hydrogen atoms from the propane molecule. This redox cycle is crucial for the efficient dehydrogenation process in CO2-ODHP.

The presence of CO2 as an oxidant in the CO2-ODHP process plays a dual role. Firstly, it enhances the reaction rate and styrene yield by acting as a soft oxidant. Secondly, it helps mitigate the coke deposition during the reaction, which is a common issue in dehydrogenation processes. This is achieved by oxidizing the coke formed on the catalyst surface, thereby regenerating the catalyst and preventing its deactivation. The coke is likely formed from the polymerization of styrene, which is a byproduct of the dehydrogenation reaction. The oxidation of coke by CO2 opens up the catalyst surface, restoring its activity and improving the overall efficiency of the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助的丙烷脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到Fe氧化物可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。可还原性允许Fe氧化物促进所需还原反应的过程。支持材料，在这种情况下是活化碳（AC），为Fe氧化物提供表面，并在反应条件下帮助稳定催化剂。提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，其中Fe(III)在脱氢步骤中被还原为Fe(II)，随后在CO2的存在下重新氧化为Fe(III)，这有助于从丙烷分子中移除氢原子。这个还原循环对于高效进行CO2-ODHP过程至关重要。

在CO2-ODHP过程中CO2作为氧化剂的作用是双管齐下的。首先，它通过充当软氧化剂来增强反应速率和苯乙烯产率。其次，它有助于缓解反应期间的焦炭沉积问题，这是脱氢过程中常见的问题。这是通过氧化催化剂表面上形成的焦炭实现的，从而再生催化剂并防止其失活。焦炭可能由脱氢反应的副产品苯乙烯聚合形成。CO2对焦炭的氧化打开催化剂表面，恢复其活性并提高CO2-ODHP过程的整体效率。

[1] "In the absence of CO2, the dehydrogenation reaction also occurred and produced a lower amount of styrene. This suggests that the direct dehydrogenation reaction of ethylbenzene to styrene occurred over the HSA-CeO2 catalyst; however, both the ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield were increased by the addition of CO2."
[2] "In the presence of CO2, the coke deposition can be effectively removed via oxidation with CO2."
[3] "It has been proposed that (13) ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 may proceed by two routes: namely, one-step and two-step pathways."
[4] "We find that the high-surface-area ceria prepared by the template-assisted synthesis method exhibits higher ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield at low temperatures (400500 C) than commercial ceria nanoparticles."
[5] "The ethylbenzene first dehydrogenated to styrene and H2, and then the H2 was available to react either with lattice O or with CO2 via the reverse water gas reaction."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of Fe oxide and the type of support material. Specifically, Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon) supports often exhibit superior catalytic activity due to their ability to maintain the reducibility of Fe oxide. This allows for an effective redox cycle that facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation process. In this context, the Fe oxide can be reduced by CO2, which then reacts with the hydrogen atoms released, promoting the dehydrogenation of propane. This mechanism involves the utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant, which not only enhances the catalytic activity but also helps in mitigating the deposition of coke during the reaction, thus maintaining the efficiency of the catalyst.

In the presence of CO2, the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation reaction follows a two-step pathway: ethylbenzene is first dehydrogenated to styrene, and then CO2 reacts with the hydrogen (H2) byproduct via the reverse water gas shift. The coke deposit, formed from the polymerization of styrene and further graphitization in the absence of CO2, is effectively oxidized by CO2 in the presence of CO2, inhibiting the coke deposition and enhancing the overall catalytic activity.

The high-surface-area ceria catalyst, synthesized via a template-assisted method, shows improved ethylbenzene conversion and styrene yield at lower temperatures (400-500°C) compared to commercial ceria nanoparticles. This improvement is attributed to the enhanced interaction of ethylbenzene with the ceria surface, facilitated by the CO2 soft oxidant. The direct dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene can occur over the ceria catalyst, and the H2 produced can react with the surface lattice oxygen or CO2 via the reverse water gas shift, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance.

The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity of the Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP. It acts as a soft oxidant, facilitating the dehydrogenation process, and helps in mitigating the coke deposition by effectively oxidizing the coke formed during the reaction. This dual functionality of CO2, as both a soft oxidant and a coke remover, significantly improves the efficiency and sustainability of the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到Fe氧化物的还原性和支持材料类型的影响。特别是，使用AC（活化碳）作为支持材料的Fe2O3/AC系统通常表现出更优越的催化活性，这得益于其维持Fe氧化物还原性的能力。这允许有效实施一个红ox循环，从而促进脱氢过程。在此背景下，Fe氧化物可以通过CO2被还原，然后与释放出的氢原子反应，促进丙烷的脱氢。这一机制涉及将CO2作为软氧化剂的利用，不仅增强了催化活性，而且帮助减轻了反应过程中产生的焦炭沉积，从而保持催化剂的效率。

在CO2的存在下，乙苯脱氢反应遵循两步途径：乙苯首先脱氢生成苯乙烯，然后CO2与氢气（H2）产物通过逆水煤气转换反应。在没有CO2的情况下形成的焦炭，通过CO2的有效氧化而分解，抑制了焦炭的沉积并提高了整体催化活性。

合成的高比表面积铈催化剂，通过模板辅助法制备，显示在较低温度（400-500°C）下比商业铈纳米颗粒更高的乙苯转化率和苯乙烯产率。这种改进归因于乙苯与铈表面增强的相互作用，得益于CO2软氧化剂的作用。乙苯可以直接在铈催化剂上脱氢为苯乙烯，产生的H2可以与表面晶格氧或CO2通过逆水煤气反应反应，有助于提高催化性能。

CO2在反应混合物中的存在对Fe氧化物基催化剂的CO2-ODHP性能具有关键作用。它作为软氧化剂，促进了脱氢过程，并通过有效氧化反应中形成的焦炭来减轻焦炭沉积。CO2的双重功能，既是软氧化剂又是焦炭去除剂，显著提高了CO2-ODHP过程的效率和可持续性。
