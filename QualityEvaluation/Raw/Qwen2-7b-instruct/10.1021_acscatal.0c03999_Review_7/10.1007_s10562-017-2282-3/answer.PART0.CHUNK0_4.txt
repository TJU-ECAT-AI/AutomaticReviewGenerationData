[1] "The present study was undertaken against the aforesaid background. In this investigation, chromium containing Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various Cr loadings (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by MW irradiation and characterized by different techniques."
[2] "The catalysts were found to be quite stable up to 8 h of time-on-stream investigated."
[3] "As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species."
[4] "The 7 wt% catalyst did not shown much drop in the catalytic activity even after 8 h of reaction time."
[5] "The mechanism of propane ODH over metal-oxide surfaces under CO2 atmosphere could be tentatively proposed in the following equations."

1. Chromium-containing Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various chromium loadings were prepared and characterized.
2. The catalysts demonstrated stability up to 8 hours of operation.
3. In the case of a lower loading sample (3 wt%), chromium(6+) is predominant, forming a framework species with CrOCr.
4. The 7 wt% catalyst maintained its catalytic activity without significant decline over 8 hours.
5. A tentative mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over metal-oxide surfaces under CO2 atmosphere is proposed.
