<p>However, it is a challenging task to design a better catalytic system with high product yield and good propylene selectivity due to the tendency of the formed alkenes towards further oxidation.</p>
<p>A number of transition metals, namely, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and other metals supported on various carriers such as metal oxides, mesoporous materials, and zeolites have been examined in the search of more effective catalysts for ODH of light alkanes including propane...</p>
<p>The UVvis DRS measurements of the synthesized samples were done under ambient conditions, and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra are found to be complex with several overlapping bands. However, some of the prominent bands were distinguishable at around 268, 370, 460, and 600 nm.</p>
<p>As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species. The presence of nanoparticles or bulk crystals of Cr2O3 are also apparent from the UVvis DRS studies. In the case of 5 wt% Cr-TUD-1 sample, the spectra reveal that there might be both 3+ and 6+ states of Cr in isolated and abundant amounts of nanoparticles.</p>
<p>The XP spectra of various samples are shown in Fig. 4. As known, the XPS analysis of Cr6+ is complex owing to the reduction of Cr6+ under the X-ray irradiation [47]. Therefore, we have analyzed the presence of Cr3+ sites, which are known to be active for the stable production of propylene.</p>
<p>As can be noted from this figure, the initial catalytic activity was found to be low at 425 C, and with the raise in the temperature the conversion increased with concomitant decrease in the selectivity towards propylene. At 550 C reaction temperature, the same trend of activity and selectivity were followed and reached to 70% selectivity at 650 C with a high conversion of 48%.</p>
<p>As can be observed from Fig. 7, various catalysts exhibited different catalytic activities based on the availability of the active Cr species. As can be seen from Fig. 7, the propane conversion increased with loading up to 7 wt% and thereafter there was a decrease with further loading of Cr to 9 wt%.</p>
<p>Based on the present study and in line with earlier reported literature, the mechanism of propane ODH over metal-oxide surfaces under CO2 atmosphere could be tentatively proposed in the following equations [10]: A weak associative adsorption of propane on the lattice oxygen...</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Catalyst reducibility affects the availability of active sites for the reaction. Support materials, like activated carbon (AC), can modify the electronic properties of Fe2O3, enhancing its catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the CO2-ODHP mechanism. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the weak associative adsorption of propane on the lattice oxygen, followed by cleavage via H-abstraction, desorption of propylene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species, and recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M (metal) center. The re-oxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of CO2 completes the redox cycle, facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

In the context of the literature, the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP is influenced by the reducibility of the Fe oxide, which determines the availability of active sites for the reaction. The support material, particularly activated carbon (AC), can modify the electronic properties of Fe2O3, enhancing its catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the mechanism of CO2-ODHP, involving steps like weak associative adsorption of propane, cleavage via H-abstraction, desorption of propylene, and recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M (metal) center, followed by re-oxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of CO2.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受催化剂还原性及支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。催化剂的还原性决定了反应活性位点的可用性。支持材料，尤其是活性炭（AC），可以改变Fe2O3的电子性质，增强其催化活性。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在CO2-ODHP机制中起着关键作用。提出的反应机制包括丙烷在晶格氧上的弱吸附性吸附、裂解通过H抽象、丙烯由吸附醇基物种的脱氢消除以及OH组分的重新组合形成水和还原M（金属）中心。还原M中心通过二氧化碳的离散化学吸附重新氧化完成氧化还原循环，促进脱氢过程。
