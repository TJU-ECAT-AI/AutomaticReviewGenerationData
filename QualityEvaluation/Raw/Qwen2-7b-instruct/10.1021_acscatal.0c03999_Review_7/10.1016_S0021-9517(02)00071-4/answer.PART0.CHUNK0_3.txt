[1] "Propane interacted with supported Rh to give propylene and propylidyene even at 253300 K."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurred with selectivities of 4055% over supported Rh catalysts."
[3] "Carbon species deposited was very unreactive toward H2: the peak temperature of its dehydrogenation fell in the range of 900950 K."
[4] "In the presence of CO2 the reaction pathway of propane is changed, and the formation of CO and H2 came into prominence."
[5] "It was shown that propylene, the product of the dehydrogenation of propane, reacted rapidly with CO2 to give CO and H2."
[6] "As regards the dry reforming of propane, the highest specific rates were measured for Rh/TiO2."

1. Supported rhodium catalysts enabled propane to interact and yield propylene and propylidyne even at temperatures as low as 253K.
2. Over supported rhodium catalysts, propane dehydrogenation to propylene occurred with selectivities ranging from 40% to 55%.
3. Deposited carbon species on the catalyst surface were very unreactive towards hydrogen, with their dehydrogenation peaking at around 900 to 950K.
4. The presence of CO2 significantly altered the reaction pathway of propane, leading to the prominence of CO and H2 formation.
5. It was demonstrated that propylene, a product of propane dehydrogenation, reacted quickly with CO2 to produce CO and H2.
6. Among the tested catalysts, those containing rhodium on titanium dioxide exhibited the highest specific rates for propane reforming.
