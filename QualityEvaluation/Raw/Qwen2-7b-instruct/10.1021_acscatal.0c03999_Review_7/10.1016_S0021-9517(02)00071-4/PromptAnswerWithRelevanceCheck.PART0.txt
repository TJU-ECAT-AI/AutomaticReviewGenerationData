<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by both the reducibility of Fe oxide and the type of support material. Catalysts containing Fe2O3 on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC) exhibit high catalytic activity due to the unique properties of Fe2O3 and the structure of AC. Fe2O3, being a redox-active material, facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by undergoing a redox cycle. This cycle involves the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe, which then reacts with CO2 to form CO and H2, and subsequently oxidizes back to Fe2O3. The support material, AC, provides a large surface area and pore structure, enhancing the accessibility of reactants and products. The electronic interaction between Fe and TiO2 in Rh/TiO2 catalysts leads to the extended dissociation of CO2 and CO, contributing to the highest specific rates of H2 and CO production among the tested catalysts.

In the presence of CO2, the reaction pathway of propane is altered, and the formation of CO and H2 becomes prominent. This is due to the promotion of CO2 dissociation and the facilitation of propane dehydrogenation by adsorbed oxygen formed in the CO2 decomposition. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the CO2-ODHP process, enabling the selective formation of CO and H2 through a series of reactions involving the reduction and oxidation of Fe oxide species.

The high activity of Rh/TiO2 catalysts towards CO2 dissociation and CO formation can be attributed to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2. This interaction extends the electron transfer from Rh into the π orbital of CO2 and CO, leading to enhanced dissociation and activation of CO2 and CO. As a result, Rh/TiO2 exhibits the highest specific rates for H2 and CO production among the catalysts tested.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受铁氧化物的可还原性和支持材料类型的影响。含Fe2O3的活性炭（Fe2O3/AC）催化剂表现出高催化活性，这是由于Fe2O3的独特性质和AC的结构。作为可还原材料，Fe2O3通过一个红ox循环促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢作用。这个循环涉及Fe2O3的还原为Fe，随后与CO2反应生成CO和H2，并且随后氧化回Fe2O3。支持材料，即活性炭，提供了大的表面积和孔结构，增强了反应物和产物的可达性。Fe与TiO2在Rh/TiO2催化剂中的电子相互作用导致CO2的延伸分解以及CO的激活，这有助于产生最高特定速率的H2和CO。 

在存在CO2的情况下，丙烷的反应途径被改变，CO和H2的形成变得突出。这是由于CO2分解和由CO2分解形成的氧吸附促进丙烷脱氢。Fe氧化物的红ox循环在CO2-ODHP过程中起着关键作用，通过一系列涉及Fe氧化物物种的还原和氧化反应，选择性地形成了CO和H2。

Rh/TiO2催化剂中电子相互作用导致的CO2和CO的增强分解可以归因于Fe与TiO2之间的电子相互作用。这种相互作用将电子从Rh传递到CO2和CO的π轨道，导致CO2和CO的增强分解和激活。因此，Rh/TiO2表现出测试催化剂中最高的H2和CO产率特定速率。
