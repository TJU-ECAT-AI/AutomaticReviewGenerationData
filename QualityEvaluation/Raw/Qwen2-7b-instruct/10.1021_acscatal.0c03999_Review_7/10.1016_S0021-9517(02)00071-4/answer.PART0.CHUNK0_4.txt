[1] "The presence of CO2 dramatically influenced the reaction pathway of C3H8, and, instead of dehydrogenation and cracking, the formation of H2 and CO came into prominence."
[2] "It was shown that propylene, the product of the dehydrogenation of propane, reacted rapidly with CO2 to give CO and H2."
[3] "The highest specific rates for the production of H2 and CO were measured for Rh/TiO2; this was explained by the extended dissociation of CO2 due to the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2."

(iii) In the presence of CO2, the reaction pathway of propane shifts, with the formation of CO and H2 becoming predominant over dehydrogenation and cracking. 

(iv) Propylene, a product of propane's dehydrogenation, reacts swiftly with CO2 to produce CO and H2. 

The highest specific rates for the creation of H2 and CO were observed with Rh/TiO2 catalysts. This is attributed to the enhanced dissociation of CO2 facilitated by the electronic interaction between Rh and TiO2, leading to more efficient CO2 utilization in the reaction.

(iii) 在二氧化碳的存在下，丙烷反应途径发生转变，生成氢气和二氧化碳成为主要产物，而非脱氢和裂解。

(iv) 丙烯（丙烷脱氢产物）迅速与二氧化碳反应生成一氧化碳和氢气。 

对于H2和CO的最高特定速率，Rh/TiO2催化剂表现出最佳性能。这归因于Rh和TiO2之间的电子相互作用导致二氧化碳的高效离解，从而在反应中更有效地利用二氧化碳。
