<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the properties of the support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC systems. A suggested reaction mechanism includes a redox cycle of Fe oxide.
