[1] "Propane interacted with supported Rh to give propylene and propylidyene even at 253300 K."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene occurred with selectivities of 4055% over supported Rh catalysts."
[3] "Carbon species deposited was very unreactive toward H2: the peak temperature of its dehydrogenation fell in the range of 900950 K."
[4] "In the presence of CO2 the reaction pathway of propane is changed, and the formation of CO and H2 came into prominence."
[5] "It was shown that propylene, the product of the dehydrogenation of propane, reacted rapidly with CO2 to give CO and H2."

(i) Supported rhodium (Rh) catalysts effectively interact with propane to produce propylene and propylidyne even at temperatures as low as 253 to 300 K.
(ii) Over Rh catalysts, propane undergoes dehydrogenation to form propylene with selectivities ranging from 40% to 55%.
(iii) Deposited carbon species on Rh catalysts are highly unreactive towards hydrogen, with their dehydrogenation peak temperature falling between 900 and 950 K.
(iv) The presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) alters the reaction pathway of propane, highlighting the formation of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2).
(v) Propylene, a product of propane dehydrogenation, reacts swiftly with CO2 to yield CO and H2.
