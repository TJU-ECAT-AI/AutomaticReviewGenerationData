<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was not discussed in the provided literature. The literature focuses on Au/ZnO catalysts and their interactions with propane and CO2. It explains that Au/ZnO catalysts show significantly higher activity in propane dehydrogenation and CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation compared to Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 catalysts. The enhanced activity of Au/ZnO catalysts is attributed to an electronic interaction between Au and n-type ZnO, which activates CO2. Adding CO2 to propane further increases the conversion in the reaction with Au/ZnO catalysts.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能没有在这份文献中讨论。文献关注于Au/ZnO催化剂及其与丙烷和CO2的相互作用。它解释说，与Au/MgO和Au/Al2O3催化剂相比，Au/ZnO催化剂在丙烷脱氢和CO2辅助氧化脱氢方面的活性显著更高。Au/ZnO催化剂增强的活性归因于Au和n型ZnO之间的电子交互，这激活了CO2。向丙烷添加CO2进一步增加了与Au/ZnO催化剂反应的转化率。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. In particular, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst showed improved activity due to its reducibility and the nature of the support material. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and enhances the dehydrogenation of propane.

3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
The main size of the Au particles in the Au/ZnO is small, 23 nm, and uniform. This value for Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 falls in the range of 210 nm. BET surface area of the catalysts used is as follows: 50 m2/g for Au/ZnO, 170 m2/g for Au/MgO and 100 m2/g for Au/Al2O3.

3.2. IR spectroscopic studies
The adsorption of propane on Au/ZnO catalyst was performed around 215 K. FTIR spectra obtained are presented in Fig. 1A. Note that the gas-phase spectrum has been subtracted from each spectrum. At 215 K absorption bands can be identified at 2981, 2967, 2960, 2901, 2875 cm−1 in the high frequency region, and 1472, 1457, 1387, 1375 cm−1 in the low frequency range.

3.3. TPD measurements
The interaction of propane with Au/ZnO catalysts and ZnO support was also examined by means of TPD measurements. The sample was kept in the propane flow for 15 min at 300 K, and then it was washed with pure Ar until it contained propane (15–20 min). TPD spectra are displayed in Fig. 1C and D.

3.4. Dehydrogenation of C3H8
Conversion of propane on various Au samples as a function of reaction temperature is given in Fig. 2A. Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO exhibited a very slight catalytic effect even at 873 K. A much higher activity was found on Au/ZnO. The reaction started above 725–750 K and the conversion of propane reached 17% at 873 K.

3.5. Reaction of CO2 + C3H8
Adding CO2 to propane caused only a slight increase in the extent of the reaction of C3H8 on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3. CO2 enhanced only moderately the extent of the reaction of propane on pure ZnO used for the preparation of Au/ZnO: the conversion of C3H8 reached only 13% at 873 K. A dramatic increase occurred, however, on Au/ZnO catalyst. The reaction started even at 650 K.

When the amount of CO2 is varied keeping the concentration of C3H8 constant, the extent of reaction of C3H8 at lower CO2 content decreased. An increase in the CO2:C3H6 ratio only slightly enhanced the conversion of C3H8 and altered only little the product distribution.

3.6. Reactions of propylene
In order to find out the fate of propylene formed in the decomposition propane, its reaction with CO2 was also examined on Au/ZnO. Propylene underwent relatively little decomposition over this catalyst. The conversion reached only 4.5% at 873 K. The main product was H2. Less amount of CH4 was also detected.

Fe oxide-based catalysts, specifically Fe2O3/AC, exhibit a notable performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The reducibility of the Fe oxide plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity, allowing for more effective interaction with the reactants and intermediates involved in the reaction. The support material, activated carbon (AC), contributes to the catalyst's surface area and porosity, providing additional sites for adsorption and reaction. This combination of reducibility and support properties enables the Fe2O3/AC catalyst to facilitate the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is central to the CO2-ODHP process. The redox cycle involves the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3+ during the reaction, followed by the oxidation back to Fe2O3, creating a dynamic environment that promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.

In the proposed reaction mechanism, the redox cycle of Fe oxide facilitates the activation of CO2, transforming it into a reactive form capable of participating in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This activation step is crucial because CO2 is typically inert under typical reaction conditions. Once activated, CO2 reacts with propane, leading to the formation of more reactive intermediates, such as CxHy fragments, which subsequently undergo decomposition or further reactions to yield desired products. The Fe2O3/AC catalyst's ability to effectively reduce and oxidize the Fe oxide species, combined with its surface properties, enables it to efficiently mediate these reactions, resulting in enhanced activity and selectivity towards the targeted products in the CO2-ODHP process.

铁氧化物基催化剂，特别是Fe2O3/AC，在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中表现出显著的性能。Fe氧化物的可还原性在提高催化活性方面起着关键作用，允许更有效地与反应物和中间体相互作用。支持材料，即活性炭（AC），为催化剂提供了表面面积和孔隙度，提供了额外的吸附和反应位点。这种结合可还原性和支持性质使Fe2O3/AC催化剂能够促进Fe氧化物的红ox循环，这是CO2-ODHP过程的核心。红ox循环涉及Fe2O3的还原到Fe3+，随后被氧化回Fe2O3，形成动态环境，促进在CO2存在的条件下丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。

在提出的反应机制中，Fe氧化物的红ox循环促进了CO2的活化，将其转化为活性形式，能够参与丙烷的氧化脱氢反应。这一活化步骤至关重要，因为通常情况下CO2在典型反应条件下是惰性的。一旦激活，CO2与丙烷反应，导致形成更活泼的中间体，如CxHy碎片，进而进一步反应以生成所需的产品。Fe2O3/AC催化剂能够有效调节Fe氧化物物种的还原和氧化，结合其表面特性，使其能够高效地介导这些反应，从而在CO2-ODHP过程中实现增强的活性和目标产品的选择性。
