The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. In particular, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst showed improved activity due to its reducibility and the nature of the support material. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, which facilitates the activation of CO2 and enhances the dehydrogenation of propane.
