[1] "Propane interacts with Au/ZnO even below 300 K yielding adsorbed propylene and propylidene."
[2] "Dehydrogenation of C3H8 and its reaction with CO2 are limited on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3."
[3] "In contrast, Az/ZnO exhibited a much higher activity in the dehydrogenation of propane. Adding CO2 to propane further increased the conversion."
[4] "The catalytic performance of Au/ZnO was explained by the occurrence of an electronic interaction between Au and n- type ZnO leading to the activation of CO2."

(i) Au/ZnO catalysts enable the interaction of propane even at temperatures below 300 K, resulting in the adsorption of propylene and propylidene.
(ii) Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 catalysts show limited activity in the dehydrogenation of propane and its reaction with CO2.
(iii) Au/ZnO catalysts exhibit significantly higher activity in propane dehydrogenation, and the addition of CO2 enhances this activity further.
(iv) The superior catalytic performance of Au/ZnO is attributed to the electronic interaction between Au particles and the n-type ZnO support, which activates CO2.

(i) Au/ZnO催化剂在低于300K的温度下就能与丙烷发生反应，产生丙烯和丙基二烯。
(ii) Au/MgO和Au/Al2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢和丙烷与CO2反应中的活性受限。
(iii) Au/ZnO催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中的活性显著更高，并且向丙烷中添加CO2可以进一步增加其转化率。
(iv) Au/ZnO催化剂表现出优越的催化性能的原因是Au颗粒与n型ZnO支持之间发生的电子相互作用，这激活了CO2。
