The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was not discussed in the provided literature. The literature focuses on Au/ZnO catalysts and their interactions with propane and CO2. It explains that Au/ZnO catalysts show significantly higher activity in propane dehydrogenation and CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation compared to Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 catalysts. The enhanced activity of Au/ZnO catalysts is attributed to an electronic interaction between Au and n-type ZnO, which activates CO2. Adding CO2 to propane further increases the conversion in the reaction with Au/ZnO catalysts.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能没有在这份文献中讨论。文献关注于Au/ZnO催化剂及其与丙烷和CO2的相互作用。它解释说，与Au/MgO和Au/Al2O3催化剂相比，Au/ZnO催化剂在丙烷脱氢和CO2辅助氧化脱氢方面的活性显著更高。Au/ZnO催化剂增强的活性归因于Au和n型ZnO之间的电子交互，这激活了CO2。向丙烷添加CO2进一步增加了与Au/ZnO催化剂反应的转化率。
