<p>Propane interacts with Au/ZnO even below 300 K yielding adsorbed propylene and propylidene.</p>
<p>In contrast, Az/ZnO exhibited a much higher activity in the dehydrogenation of propane. Adding CO2 to propane further increased the conversion.</p>
<p>The catalytic performance of Au/ZnO was explained by the occurrence of an electronic interaction between Au and n-type ZnO leading to the activation of CO2.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Au/ZnO catalysts enable the interaction of propane at temperatures as low as 300 K, resulting in the adsorption of propylene and propylidene.
2. Au/ZnO catalysts demonstrate significantly higher activity in propane dehydrogenation compared to Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3. The addition of CO2 further enhances the conversion of propane.
3. The superior catalytic performance of Au/ZnO catalysts is attributed to the electronic interaction between Au nanoparticles and the n-type ZnO support, which activates CO2.

1. Au/ZnO 催化剂在300 K以下就能与丙烷发生相互作用，产生丙烯和丙基二烯。
2. Au/ZnO 催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性远高于Au/MgO和Au/Al2O3。向丙烷中添加CO2可进一步提高转化率。
3. Au/ZnO 催化剂表现出优异的催化性能的原因在于Au纳米颗粒与n型ZnO支持之间发生的电子相互作用，激活了CO2。
