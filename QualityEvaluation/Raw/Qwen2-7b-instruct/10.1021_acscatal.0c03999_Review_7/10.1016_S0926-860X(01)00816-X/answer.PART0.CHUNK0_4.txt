Choudhary et al. at the National Chemical Laboratory, India, have examined strontium and other rare earth oxides deposited on sintered low surface area supports precoated with lanthanum and other rare earth oxides [49,50]. A Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst showed the high-est activity and selectivity for ethane. At 800 C, the Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst was capable of giving 60% conversion of ethane and greater than 80% selectivity to ethylene.

Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous, and at least one promoter selected from a list of elements [51,52]. At 650 C, the lithium/titanium catalyst with manganese gave an ethane conversion of 47% and a selectivity to ethylene of 75%.

Dang et al. at the Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, China, have examined a vanadium oxide on barium carbonate catalyst at 650 C that gave good activity [46]. At 34% conversion of ethane,they obtained 76% selectivity for ethylene. Au and coworkers at Hong Kong Baptist University examined SrFeO3δClσ and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 [47,48]. Of the two, SrFeO3δClσ gave the higher yield of ethylene.

Lin et al. at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan, and Chonnam National University, Korea, found that a SrBi3O4Cl3 catalyst at 640 C is capable of giving 90% selectivity to ethylene at a 25% conversion of ethane [45]. Co-feeding HCl did not change the conversion or the selectivity,but did slow the activity decrease along with the loss of chlorine observed in its absence.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the catalyst's reducibility and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations. Catalysts like Sr-Nd2O3, SrFeO3δClσ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 show high activity and selectivity for ethane, capable of giving 60% conversion and over 80% selectivity to ethylene at 800 C. The Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst specifically demonstrates high activity and selectivity for ethane. The Li/Ti/Mn catalyst provides 47% ethane conversion and 75% selectivity to ethylene at 650 C. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, influencing the conversion and selectivity of the ethane to ethylene. 

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe oxide acts as both a reducing agent and an oxidizing agent. Initially, the Fe oxide reduces H2 to H2O, generating heat and removing O2. Following this, dehydrogenation of C2H6 occurs to produce C2H4 and H2. This process might involve catalytic reactions on the FeSn surface, pure homogeneous reactions, or a catalytic H2 oxidation followed by homogeneous ethane decomposition. The exact mechanism remains subject to debate, as none appears fully satisfactory. The redox cycle allows for efficient conversion of ethane to ethylene, but questions remain regarding long-term catalyst activity, selectivity, and safety on a commercial scale.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支撑材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC配置。Sr-Nd2O3、SrFeO3δClσ和Ho2O3与BaCl2等催化剂显示出高活性和乙烷选择性，在800℃时能提供60%的乙烷转化率和超过80%的乙烯选择性。具体而言，Sr-Nd2O3催化剂表现出对乙烷的高活性和选择性。Li/Ti/Mn催化剂在650℃时提供47%的乙烷转化率和75%的乙烯选择性。Fe氧化物的还原循环在催化活性中起着关键作用，影响乙烷向乙烯的转化和选择性。 

提出的反应机理涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，Fe氧化物作为还原剂和氧化剂发挥作用。首先，Fe氧化物将H2还原为H2O，产生热量并移除O2。随后，C2H6发生脱氢反应生成C2H4和H2。此过程可能涉及FeSn表面的催化反应、纯均相反应或催化H2氧化后进行均相乙烷分解。具体的机制仍有待讨论，因为没有一个完全令人满意。还原循环允许高效地将乙烷转化为乙烯，但关于催化剂的长期活性、选择性和商业规模的安全性仍存在疑问。
