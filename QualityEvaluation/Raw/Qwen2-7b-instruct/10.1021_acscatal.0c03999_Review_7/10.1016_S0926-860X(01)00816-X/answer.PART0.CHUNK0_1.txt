Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the support material. Specifically, in Fe2O3/AC catalysts, the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support, particularly the activation carbon (AC), play crucial roles in enhancing catalytic activity. 

Reduction of the Fe oxide allows for better exposure of active sites and promotes the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is central to the reaction mechanism. This cycle involves the adsorption of CO2, followed by the reduction of Fe oxide, which leads to the formation of surface carboxyl groups and subsequent oxidation of these groups to form CO and H2O. This process facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

The support material, especially the AC, influences the activity by providing a surface for the adsorption and reaction of CO2, facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products, and promoting the redox cycle. The porosity and surface area of the AC can affect the efficiency of CO2 adsorption and the accessibility of the Fe oxide active sites, thereby impacting the overall catalytic activity.

In summary, the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP is enhanced by the synergistic effects of the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material, particularly the AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the adsorption of CO2, reduction, and subsequent oxidation, is the proposed reaction mechanism driving the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
