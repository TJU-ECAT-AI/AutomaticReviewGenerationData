The Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) are influenced by their reducibility and support materials. Specifically, Fe2O3/AC catalysts have been used in this context. The reducibility of Fe2O3 allows for the formation of Fe3+, which is crucial for the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The AC support material enhances the dispersion of Fe2O3, promoting better catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ upon adsorption of propane, leading to the breaking of the alkane C-H bonds and the formation of ethylene. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture facilitates the oxidation of the evolved H2, contributing to the selectivity of ethylene production.

Analyze the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), explaining how catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) influence catalytic activity, and describe the proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the support material. Specifically, in Fe2O3/AC catalysts, the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support, particularly the activation carbon (AC), play crucial roles in enhancing catalytic activity. 

Reduction of the Fe oxide allows for better exposure of active sites and promotes the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which is central to the reaction mechanism. This cycle involves the adsorption of CO2, followed by the reduction of Fe oxide, which leads to the formation of surface carboxyl groups and subsequent oxidation of these groups to form CO and H2O. This process facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

The support material, especially the AC, influences the activity by providing a surface for the adsorption and reaction of CO2, facilitating the diffusion of reactants and products, and promoting the redox cycle. The porosity and surface area of the AC can affect the efficiency of CO2 adsorption and the accessibility of the Fe oxide active sites, thereby impacting the overall catalytic activity.

In summary, the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP is enhanced by the synergistic effects of the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material, particularly the AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving the adsorption of CO2, reduction, and subsequent oxidation, is the proposed reaction mechanism driving the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), we find that the reducibility of Fe oxide and the choice of support material play critical roles in determining the catalytic activity. 

Specifically, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst system exhibits high catalytic activity due to the synergistic effects of the Fe oxide and the activated carbon support. The reducibility of Fe oxide allows for the formation of active Fe species upon reaction with oxygen, which are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the high surface area and porosity of activated carbon facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) ions are reduced to Fe(II) by oxygen or surface hydrogen, leading to the formation of reactive intermediates that facilitate the dehydrogenation and oxidation of propane to propylene. The surface of the Fe2O3/AC catalyst is rich in active sites for the reaction, enabling high selectivity towards propylene formation.

Furthermore, the catalyst can be tuned to favor either propylene or acetic acid production by modifying the elemental composition of the catalyst and adjusting the reaction conditions. This tunability provides flexibility in optimizing the catalyst for specific applications.

In summary, the Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP are effective due to their reducibility, high surface area, and the ability to promote a redox cycle that facilitates the desired chemical transformations. The catalysts can be further customized to enhance propylene selectivity or acetic acid production, depending on the desired outcome.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the catalyst's reducibility and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations. Catalysts like Sr-Nd2O3, SrFeO3δClσ, and Ho2O3 with BaCl2 show high activity and selectivity for ethane, capable of giving 60% conversion and over 80% selectivity to ethylene at 800 C. The Sr-Nd2O3 catalyst specifically demonstrates high activity and selectivity for ethane. The Li/Ti/Mn catalyst provides 47% ethane conversion and 75% selectivity to ethylene at 650 C. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, influencing the conversion and selectivity of the ethane to ethylene. 

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe oxide acts as both a reducing agent and an oxidizing agent. Initially, the Fe oxide reduces H2 to H2O, generating heat and removing O2. Following this, dehydrogenation of C2H6 occurs to produce C2H4 and H2. This process might involve catalytic reactions on the FeSn surface, pure homogeneous reactions, or a catalytic H2 oxidation followed by homogeneous ethane decomposition. The exact mechanism remains subject to debate, as none appears fully satisfactory. The redox cycle allows for efficient conversion of ethane to ethylene, but questions remain regarding long-term catalyst activity, selectivity, and safety on a commercial scale.
