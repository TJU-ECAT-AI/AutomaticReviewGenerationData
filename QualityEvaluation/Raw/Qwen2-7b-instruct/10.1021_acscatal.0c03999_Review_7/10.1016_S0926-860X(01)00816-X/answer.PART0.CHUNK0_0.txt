The Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) are influenced by their reducibility and support materials. Specifically, Fe2O3/AC catalysts have been used in this context. The reducibility of Fe2O3 allows for the formation of Fe3+, which is crucial for the redox cycle of Fe oxide. The AC support material enhances the dispersion of Fe2O3, promoting better catalytic activity. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe3+ is reduced to Fe2+ upon adsorption of propane, leading to the breaking of the alkane C-H bonds and the formation of ethylene. The presence of CO2 in the reaction mixture facilitates the oxidation of the evolved H2, contributing to the selectivity of ethylene production.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在丙烷的二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中受到其可还原性和支持材料的影响。具体来说，使用了Fe2O3/AC催化剂。Fe2O3的可还原性允许Fe3+的形成，这对Fe氧化物的还原循环至关重要。AC作为支持材料，提高了Fe2O3的分散性，促进了更好的催化活性。提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，其中Fe3+在丙烷吸附时被还原，导致烷烃C-H键的断裂和乙烯的生成。反应混合物中的CO2有助于蒸发H2的氧化，从而增加了乙烯的选择性。
