[1] "Early work in this area was conducted by Thorstein-son et al. using a vanadium molybdenum niobium oxide catalyst [30,31], and a number of papers and patents based on that work have been issued by Union Carbide Corp. and other laboratories [3239]."
[2] "Ethane is thought to react with molybdenum or vanadium in the catalyst to form surface ethoxide, which can then undergo a beta-elimination process to form ethylene."
[3] "The surface ethoxide can be oxidized further to make surface acetate, which leads to acetic acid on hydrolysis. Acetic acid in varying amounts is co-produced with ethylene at pressures greater than one atmosphere."
[4] "Later work has shown that catalysts can be made selective for either ethylene or acetic acid by modifications in the elemental makeup of the catalyst and suitable adjustments of reaction conditions [38,39]."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), we find that the reducibility of Fe oxide and the choice of support material play critical roles in determining the catalytic activity. 

Specifically, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst system exhibits high catalytic activity due to the synergistic effects of the Fe oxide and the activated carbon support. The reducibility of Fe oxide allows for the formation of active Fe species upon reaction with oxygen, which are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. Meanwhile, the high surface area and porosity of activated carbon facilitate the diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the catalytic efficiency.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) ions are reduced to Fe(II) by oxygen or surface hydrogen, leading to the formation of reactive intermediates that facilitate the dehydrogenation and oxidation of propane to propylene. The surface of the Fe2O3/AC catalyst is rich in active sites for the reaction, enabling high selectivity towards propylene formation.

Furthermore, the catalyst can be tuned to favor either propylene or acetic acid production by modifying the elemental composition of the catalyst and adjusting the reaction conditions. This tunability provides flexibility in optimizing the catalyst for specific applications.

In summary, the Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP are effective due to their reducibility, high surface area, and the ability to promote a redox cycle that facilitates the desired chemical transformations. The catalysts can be further customized to enhance propylene selectivity or acetic acid production, depending on the desired outcome.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能，我们发现催化剂的可还原性以及支持材料的选择对催化活性具有关键作用。

具体而言，Fe2O3/AC催化剂体系表现出高催化活性，这是由于Fe氧化物和活性炭支持的协同效应。Fe氧化物的可还原性允许在其与氧气反应后形成活性Fe物种，这对于氧化脱氢过程至关重要。同时，活性炭的高比表面积和孔隙率有助于反应物和产物的扩散，从而提高催化效率。

提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，其中Fe(III)离子通过氧或表面氢被还原为Fe(II)，导致形成促进丙烷到丙烯转化的活性中间体。Fe2O3/AC催化剂表面富含活性位点，能够促进所需化学转换。

此外，可以通过修改催化剂的元素组成和调整反应条件来调节催化剂，以优化其用于丙烯或乙酸生产。这提供了根据特定应用优化催化剂的灵活性。

综上所述，CO2-ODHP中的铁氧化物基催化剂有效，原因是它们的可还原性、高比表面积以及促进所需化学转化的还原循环。催化剂可以根据需要优化以增强丙烯选择性或乙酸生产。
