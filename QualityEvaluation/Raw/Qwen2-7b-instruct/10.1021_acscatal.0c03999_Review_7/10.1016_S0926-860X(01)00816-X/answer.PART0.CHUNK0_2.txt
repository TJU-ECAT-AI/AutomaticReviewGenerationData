Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, suitably modified with other elements give a selectivity to ethylene in the range of approximately 70% at approximately 70% conversion of ethane.

Iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide are optimally used with a flow of hydro- gen chloride and water in addition to ethane and wa-ter. 

A Na2WO4-Mn/SiO2 catalyst (a high-selectivity methane coupling catalyst) at 700 C is capable of giving greater than 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 10% selectivity to methane) at >70% conversion of ethane.

Lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650 C yielded 70% selectivity to ethylene (and 2% to methane) at 98% conversion of ethane.

A SrBi3O4Cl3 catalyst at 640 C is capable of giving 90% selectivity to ethylene at a 25% conversion of ethane.

Workers at Phillips Petroleum Company have examined catalysts comprising lithium, titanium, and manganese, and catalysts comprising cobalt, phosphorous potassium, and zirconium where the cobalt was introduced as cobalt sulfide.

A Pt-coated ceramic foam monolith at approximately 1000 C at contact times on the order of 1 ms gives conversions of ethane on the order of 70% and selectivities on the order of 65%.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. The use of iron-containing solid solution catalysts stabilized with metal oxide, in conjunction with a flow of hydrogen chloride and water, allows for an optimal catalytic activity. These catalysts can achieve a selectivity of approximately 70% to ethylene at around 70% conversion of ethane.

Phosphorous/molybdenum/antimony oxide catalysts, when suitably modified with other elements, demonstrate a selectivity of around 70% for ethylene at approximately 70% conversion of ethane. Lithium chloride on sulfated zirconia at 650°C yields a selectivity of 70% to ethylene and 2% to methane at 98% conversion of ethane. A SrBi3O4Cl3 catalyst at 640°C provides 90% selectivity to ethylene at a 25% conversion of ethane.

Catalysts composed of lithium, titanium, and manganese, as well as cobalt, phosphorous potassium, and zirconium, where the cobalt is introduced as cobalt sulfide, are also effective in CO2-ODHP. A Pt-coated ceramic foam monolith operating at around 1000°C with contact times of milliseconds enables conversions of ethane around 70% and selectivities around 65%.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。通过使用含铁固溶体催化剂并稳定金属氧化物，结合氢氯气和水的流动，可以获得最佳催化活性。这些催化剂可以在大约70%的乙烷转化率时达到约70%的乙烯选择性。

磷酸、钼、锑氧化物催化剂，在适当改性后，显示出在大约70%的乙烷转化率时，对于乙烯的选择性约为70%。在650°C下，锂氯化物负载在硫化锆上可以得到70%的乙烯选择性和2%的甲烷选择性，当乙烷转化率为98%时。在640°C下，SrBi3O4Cl3催化剂可以提供90%的乙烯选择性和25%的乙烷转化率。

由锂、钛和锰组成的催化剂，以及钴、磷钾和锆组成的催化剂，其中钴以二氧化钴的形式引入，也在CO2-ODHP中表现出良好的效果。在大约1000°C下，使用接触时间在毫秒级的铂涂层陶瓷泡沫多孔体可以实现大约70%的乙烷转化率和65%的选择性。
