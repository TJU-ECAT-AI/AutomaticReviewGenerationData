An analysis of the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals several key factors influencing catalytic activity. Reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material play crucial roles. In particular, the use of Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon) as a support material has been highlighted. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the catalyst undergoes reduction and oxidation cycles during the reaction, facilitating the activation of propane and subsequent conversion to olefins.

The presence of oxygen is critical for enhancing the catalytic activity. It accelerates the reaction pathway, leading to a significant increase in the formation rates of hydrocarbon products when the oxygen concentration is increased from 0 to 5 mbar. This effect is attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals.

The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step. This is supported by the observation that the selectivity patterns are largely determined by the gas-phase radical chemistry. 

Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibitory effect on the catalyst activity, leading to an apparent order of 1 for all products. This is believed to be due to the blocking of active sites by the formation of Li+CO3 on the active site of the catalyst.

对Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）性能的分析揭示了几个影响催化活性的关键因素。Fe氧化物的还原性和支持材料的特性起着至关重要的作用。特别是在使用Fe2O3/AC（活化碳）作为支持材料时，已经进行了强调。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在反应过程中，催化剂经历还原和氧化周期，促进丙烷的激活和随后转化为烯烃。

氧气的存在对于提高催化活性至关重要。它加快了反应途径，导致当氧气浓度从0增加到5毫巴时，形成各种碳氢化合物产品的速率显著增加。这种效果归因于氧分子与链载体自由基的相互作用，通过OH自由基打开了快速反应路径。

丙烷、乙烷和丁烷的转化趋势证明了烷基氢提取是决定性步骤。这得到了观察到的选择性模式主要由气相自由基化学所确定的支持。

二氧化碳对催化剂活性有强烈的抑制作用，导致所有产物的明显顺序为1。这被认为是由于活性位点被Li+CO3在催化剂活性位点上的形成所阻塞的结果。
