An analysis of the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals several key factors influencing catalytic activity. Reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material play crucial roles. In particular, the use of Fe2O3/AC (activated carbon) as a support material has been highlighted. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the catalyst undergoes reduction and oxidation cycles during the reaction, facilitating the activation of propane and subsequent conversion to olefins.

The presence of oxygen is critical for enhancing the catalytic activity. It accelerates the reaction pathway, leading to a significant increase in the formation rates of hydrocarbon products when the oxygen concentration is increased from 0 to 5 mbar. This effect is attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals.

The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step. This is supported by the observation that the selectivity patterns are largely determined by the gas-phase radical chemistry. 

Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibitory effect on the catalyst activity, leading to an apparent order of 1 for all products. This is believed to be due to the blocking of active sites by the formation of Li+CO3 on the active site of the catalyst.

对Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）性能的分析揭示了几个影响催化活性的关键因素。Fe氧化物的还原性和支持材料的特性起着至关重要的作用。特别是在使用Fe2O3/AC（活化碳）作为支持材料时，已经进行了强调。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，在反应过程中，催化剂经历还原和氧化周期，促进丙烷的激活和随后转化为烯烃。

氧气的存在对于提高催化活性至关重要。它加快了反应途径，导致当氧气浓度从0增加到5毫巴时，形成各种碳氢化合物产品的速率显著增加。这种效果归因于氧分子与链载体自由基的相互作用，通过OH自由基打开了快速反应路径。

丙烷、乙烷和丁烷的转化趋势证明了烷基氢提取是决定性步骤。这得到了观察到的选择性模式主要由气相自由基化学所确定的支持。

二氧化碳对催化剂活性有强烈的抑制作用，导致所有产物的明显顺序为1。这被认为是由于活性位点被Li+CO3在催化剂活性位点上的形成所阻塞的结果。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the materials they are supported on, particularly in the case of Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility allows the Fe oxide to switch between its oxidized and reduced states, facilitating the redox cycle necessary for the catalytic process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), affects the accessibility of reactants and products to the catalyst surface. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then reoxidized, playing a key role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and propene.

The presence of gas-phase oxygen is crucial for propane conversion in the context of CO2-ODHP. Oxygen facilitates a fast reaction pathway, enhancing the conversion rates significantly. This is attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with chain-carrier radicals, accelerating the formation of OH radicals.

Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of the catalyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site. This effect is observed in the gas phase as well, where reactions are not influenced by CO2.

The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane support the proposition that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. This is in line with the observations that the conversion level of propane does not influence the selectivities, unlike in typical redox catalysts such as vanadia. The relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction conditions is responsible for the lower reactivity of propene conversion compared to propane.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到其可还原性以及支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的情况下。可还原性允许铁氧化物在氧化和还原状态之间转换，这对于催化过程至关重要。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），影响反应物和产物对催化剂表面的可接近性。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，然后重新氧化，在丙烷和丙烯的氧化脱氢中起关键作用。

氧气的存在对于丙烷转化在CO2-ODHP中至关重要。氧气促进了快速反应途径，显著提高了转化速率。这归因于氧分子与链载体自由基的相互作用，加速了OH自由基的形成。

二氧化碳对催化剂所有产品的活性有强烈的抑制作用。观察到的顺序为1，这是由于在活性位点上形成Li+CO3导致活性位点被阻塞的结果。这一效果不仅在气体相中被观察到，气体相中的反应不受CO2影响。

乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化趋势支持氢从烷烃的提取是决定性步骤的假设。这与观察到的丙烷转化水平不影响选择性相反，类似于典型的氧化还原催化剂如二氧化钒。在反应条件下，中间的亚甲基自由基相对稳定，导致丙烯的转化速率低于丙烷。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide.

Catalyst reducibility plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity of Fe oxide-based catalysts. High reducibility allows for better exposure of active sites, leading to improved performance in CO2-ODHP. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), facilitates dispersion of the metal oxide, ensuring uniform distribution of active sites and improving the overall catalytic efficiency.

Support materials like AC contribute to the catalytic performance by providing a large surface area, which enhances the contact between the catalyst and reactants. Additionally, the support material may influence the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, affecting its stability and activity over multiple reaction cycles.

The reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP in the context of Fe oxide-based catalysts likely involves a redox cycle of the Fe oxide. This cycle enables the catalyst to switch between reduced and oxidized states, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox activity of Fe oxide is critical for the activation of propane, as well as the formation and regeneration of reactive intermediates involved in the dehydrogenation process.

In summary, the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP is enhanced by the combination of high reducibility and the presence of a suitable support material like AC. The proposed reaction mechanism includes a redox cycle of the Fe oxide, contributing to the efficient oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
