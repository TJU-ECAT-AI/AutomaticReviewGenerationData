The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the materials they are supported on, particularly in the case of Fe2O3/AC. Reducibility allows the Fe oxide to switch between its oxidized and reduced states, facilitating the redox cycle necessary for the catalytic process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), affects the accessibility of reactants and products to the catalyst surface. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then reoxidized, playing a key role in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and propene.

The presence of gas-phase oxygen is crucial for propane conversion in the context of CO2-ODHP. Oxygen facilitates a fast reaction pathway, enhancing the conversion rates significantly. This is attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with chain-carrier radicals, accelerating the formation of OH radicals.

Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibitory effect on the activity of the catalyst for all products. The apparent order is 1, which is attributed to blocking of active sites by forming Li+CO3 on the active site. This effect is observed in the gas phase as well, where reactions are not influenced by CO2.

The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane support the proposition that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step. This is in line with the observations that the conversion level of propane does not influence the selectivities, unlike in typical redox catalysts such as vanadia. The relative stability of the intermediate allyl radical compared to the propyl radical under reaction conditions is responsible for the lower reactivity of propene conversion compared to propane.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到其可还原性以及支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的情况下。可还原性允许铁氧化物在氧化和还原状态之间转换，这对于催化过程至关重要。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），影响反应物和产物对催化剂表面的可接近性。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，然后重新氧化，在丙烷和丙烯的氧化脱氢中起关键作用。

氧气的存在对于丙烷转化在CO2-ODHP中至关重要。氧气促进了快速反应途径，显著提高了转化速率。这归因于氧分子与链载体自由基的相互作用，加速了OH自由基的形成。

二氧化碳对催化剂所有产品的活性有强烈的抑制作用。观察到的顺序为1，这是由于在活性位点上形成Li+CO3导致活性位点被阻塞的结果。这一效果不仅在气体相中被观察到，气体相中的反应不受CO2影响。

乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化趋势支持氢从烷烃的提取是决定性步骤的假设。这与观察到的丙烷转化水平不影响选择性相反，类似于典型的氧化还原催化剂如二氧化钒。在反应条件下，中间的亚甲基自由基相对稳定，导致丙烯的转化速率低于丙烷。
