<p>The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene).</p>
<p>Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism. First, the presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane.</p>
<p>Alkane activation via a CH bond splitting is the rate-determining step for all reaction products.</p>
<p>Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst.</p>
<p>The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate-determining step.</p>

1. The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking achieves yields of up to 50% olefin, including propene and ethene.
2. Oxygen plays a crucial role in influencing the radical gas-phase chemistry, significantly increasing the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals.
3. Carbon dioxide exhibits a strong inhibitory effect on the reaction, maintaining the product distribution without altering it, due to its strong adsorption on the propane activation site.
4. Activation of alkanes through a CH bond split acts as the rate-determining step for all reaction products.
5. The sequential reactions of propene predominantly result in carbon oxides and occur mainly on the catalyst.
6. The conversion patterns of ethane, propane, and butane affirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane serves as the rate-determining step.

1. 烷烃氧化脱氢化和裂解的催化性能可达到高达50%的烯烃产率，包括丙烯和乙烯。
2. 氧气在机制中具有两个功能。首先，少量氧气的存在显著影响了气体相化学反应，显著增加了链传递自由基的类型和浓度。
3. 二氧化碳对反应表现出强烈的抑制作用，维持了产品分布而不改变它，由于其在烷烃激活位点上的强烈吸附。
4. 通过CH键断裂的烷基激活是所有反应产物的决定性步骤。
5. 丙烯的连续反应主要产生碳氧化物，并且主要在催化剂上进行。
6. 乙烷、丙烷和丁烷的转化模式证实了从烷烃脱氢是决定性步骤。
