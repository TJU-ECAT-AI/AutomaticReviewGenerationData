[1] "An increased olefin demand (especially C2C4 olefins) is predicted for the coming years [1,2]; consequently in- dustry is seeking alternative routes for the production of lower olefins, as the present production capacity will not meet the needs."
[2] "The role of oxygen in activating propane is complex. The presence of oxygen opens a fast reaction pathway, shown by the marked increase of the rates of hydrocarbon product formation upon increasing the oxygen concentration from 0 to 5 mbar (Fig. 4)."
[3] "The catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation and cracking shows yields up to 50% of olefin (propene and ethene)."
[4] "The reaction kinetics were studied by means of variation of the partial pressures of the reactants as well as by addition of product species to the reaction mixture."
[5] "The observations can be qualitatively explained with a mechanism including activation of propane on the catalyst generating propyl radicals that undergo a radical-chain mechanism in the gas phase."
[6] "Alkane activation is rate determining. Oxygen has two functions in the mechanism. First, the presence of small amounts of oxygen influences the radical gas-phase chemistry significantly because the type and concentration of chain propagator radicals are greatly increased."
[7] "Carbon dioxide has a strong inhibiting effect on the reaction without changing the product distribution, due to strong adsorption on the site that activates propane."
[8] "The presence of gas-phase oxygen appears to be crucial for propane conversion. The strong increase of the reac- tion rates by increasing the oxygen concentration has been attributed to the interaction of oxygen molecules with the chain-carrier radicals, opening a fast reaction pathway via OH radicals."
[9] "Consecutive reactions of propene give almost exclusively carbon oxides and proceeds mainly on the catalyst."
[10] "The conversion trends of ethane, propane, and butane confirm that hydrogen abstraction from the alkane is the rate- determining step."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide.

Catalyst reducibility plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity of Fe oxide-based catalysts. High reducibility allows for better exposure of active sites, leading to improved performance in CO2-ODHP. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), facilitates dispersion of the metal oxide, ensuring uniform distribution of active sites and improving the overall catalytic efficiency.

Support materials like AC contribute to the catalytic performance by providing a large surface area, which enhances the contact between the catalyst and reactants. Additionally, the support material may influence the reducibility and reoxidizability of the catalyst, affecting its stability and activity over multiple reaction cycles.

The reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP in the context of Fe oxide-based catalysts likely involves a redox cycle of the Fe oxide. This cycle enables the catalyst to switch between reduced and oxidized states, facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox activity of Fe oxide is critical for the activation of propane, as well as the formation and regeneration of reactive intermediates involved in the dehydrogenation process.

In summary, the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP is enhanced by the combination of high reducibility and the presence of a suitable support material like AC. The proposed reaction mechanism includes a redox cycle of the Fe oxide, contributing to the efficient oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
