The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the provided literature. Specifically, the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, on catalytic activity was discussed. The literature highlighted that the promoting effects of CO2 were observed only on SiO2-supported catalysts. The enhancement of the yield of C3H6 and suppression of catalyst deactivation were noted as the effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. It was further explained that the partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. Additionally, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2. This indicates that the redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, especially when CO2 is involved in the process.

文献分析了Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）过程中的性能。特别强调了催化剂可还原性与支持材料（特别是在Fe2O3/AC中）对催化活性的影响。文献指出，仅在SiO2支持的催化剂上观察到CO2促进效果。CO2增强丙烷脱氢性能的表现为提高C3H6的产率并抑制催化剂失活。文献还提到，部分氧化的Cr2O3支持在SiO2催化剂对C3H8的脱氢活性有贡献。此外，文献表明，在CO2存在下，Cr2O3/SiO2表面可能被维持为部分氧化状态。这表明Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在催化活性中起着关键作用，尤其是在CO2参与过程中。
