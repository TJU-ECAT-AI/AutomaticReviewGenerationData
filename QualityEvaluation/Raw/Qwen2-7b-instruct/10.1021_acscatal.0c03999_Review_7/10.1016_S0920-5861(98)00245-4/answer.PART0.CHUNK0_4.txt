<p>The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.</p>
<p>The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.</p>
<p>The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>In order to study the contribution of CO2 in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, catalytic tests with alternate feeds of C3H8/Ar and C3H8/CO2/Ar were carried out. The results shown in Fig. 3 clearly indicate that the presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2.</p>
<p>The effect of CO2 addition on the deactivation of a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was also examined (Fig. 5). The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>The yield of C3H6 reached a maximum of about 21% at the second pulse. After the second pulse, the yield of C3H6 slightly decreased with increasing pulse number. The yield of C3H6 decreased to 17% by the treatment of the catalyst with H2 after fifth pulse, and remained constant from sixth pulse to ninth pulse. The treatment of the catalyst with CO2 after ninth pulse raised the yield of C3H6 to 19%, but the yield of C3H6 gradually decreased with increasing pulse number from tenth pulse.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in the document. The key points regarding catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, influencing catalytic activity are as follows:

1. Carbon dioxide promoted the dehydrogenation of propane only on SiO2-supported catalysts, not on those supported on Al2O3 or active carbon.
2. The presence of CO2 enhanced the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressed catalyst deactivation on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.
3. The activity of Cr2O3/Al2O3 was significantly lower in CO2 presence compared to its absence. In contrast, the activity of Cr2O3/AC was unaffected by CO2. Surprisingly, the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst's activity increased by 40% in CO2 presence.
4. The Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst's activity remained high even after multiple pulses of propane, suggesting that the presence of CO2 maintains the catalyst's reactivity.
5. The boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles play a crucial role in the CO2-promoted dehydrogenation process.
6. CO2 addition significantly reduced the deactivation of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, indicating its protective effect on the catalyst.
7. Pulse reaction studies showed that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were more active for dehydrogenation than fully reduced ones, further supporting the role of CO2 in enhancing catalytic activity.

In summary, the presence of CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation of propane on SiO2-supported catalysts, specifically Cr2O3/SiO2, by increasing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. This promoting effect of CO2 occurs at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles, which might be due to the redox cycle of Fe oxide involved in the catalytic process.

The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) ions are reduced to Fe(II) by hydrogen, forming a reactive intermediate that facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane. The presence of CO2 modifies this redox cycle, possibly by oxidizing some part of the Fe oxide surface, maintaining a partially oxidized state that is favorable for the catalytic activity. This partial oxidation might stabilize the Fe(II) species, facilitating the dehydrogenation process and reducing the catalyst's deactivation.

在文档中分析了铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能。关于催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC），影响催化活性的关键点如下：

1. 只有在SiO2支持的催化剂上，二氧化碳才促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，而Al2O3或活性碳上的催化剂则没有这种效果。
2. 在二氧化碳存在下，SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂的活性比其不存在时提高了40%。相比之下，Cr2O3/AC催化剂在二氧化碳存在与否下活性不受影响。
3. Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的活性显著低于其不存在时。相反，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳存在下表现出更高的活性。
4. 即使经过多次丙烷脉冲处理后，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性仍然很高，这表明二氧化碳对催化剂保持高活性有重要作用。
5. 二氧化碳添加显著减少了Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的失活，表明它对催化剂具有保护作用。
6. 脉冲反应研究表明，部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂对于脱氢反应更为活跃，这进一步支持了二氧化碳增强催化活性的作用。
7. 在二氧化碳存在的条件下，SiO2支持的催化剂表现出了更好的活性，尤其是Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，这表明二氧化碳促进脱氢过程，并抑制催化剂失活。

综上所述，二氧化碳通过增加丙烷脱氢产物（丙烯）的产率并抑制催化剂失活，在SiO2支持的催化剂上（特别是Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂）增强了丙烷脱氢反应的性能。这一促进作用发生在Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面上，这可能是由于铁氧化物参与的催化过程中的氧化还原循环所导致的。该循环可能涉及Fe(III)离子被氢还原为Fe(II)，形成一种活性中间体，从而促进丙烷的脱氢反应。二氧化碳的存在可能通过氧化Fe氧化物表面的一部分，维持部分氧化状态，有利于催化活性。这种部分氧化可能稳定了Fe(II)物种，促进了脱氢过程并减少了催化剂的失活。

提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中Fe(III)离子由氢还原为Fe(II)，形成一种有利于催化活性的活性中间体。二氧化碳的存在可能通过氧化Fe氧化物表面的一部分，维持一个部分氧化的状态，这有利于脱氢过程并减少催化剂的失活。
