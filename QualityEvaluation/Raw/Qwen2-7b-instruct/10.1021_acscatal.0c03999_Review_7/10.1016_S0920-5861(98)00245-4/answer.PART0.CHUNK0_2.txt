The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Specifically, the reducibility of Fe oxide allows for an active state that enhances the dehydrogenation of propane. Among the Fe oxide-based catalysts, those supported on SiO2 exhibit the best performance in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation, as the SiO2 support maintains the Fe oxide surface in a partially oxidized state, which is beneficial for the reaction. This is because the partially oxidized state of Fe oxide can lead to a faster reaction rate and higher yield of C3H6 compared to a fully reduced state. Moreover, the presence of CO2 helps in maintaining this partially oxidized state, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and suppressing the catalyst deactivation during the dehydrogenation process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响。具体来说，Fe氧化物的可还原性允许活性状态，从而增强丙烷的脱氢反应。在Fe氧化物基催化剂中，那些负载在SiO2上的表现出最佳的CO2辅助脱氢性能，因为SiO2支持能够保持Fe氧化物表面处于部分氧化状态，这对反应有利。这是因为部分氧化的Fe氧化物状态可以导致更快的反应速率和更高的C3H6产率，与完全还原状态相比。此外，CO2的存在有助于保持这种部分氧化状态，从而增强催化活性并抑制催化剂在脱氢过程中的失活。
