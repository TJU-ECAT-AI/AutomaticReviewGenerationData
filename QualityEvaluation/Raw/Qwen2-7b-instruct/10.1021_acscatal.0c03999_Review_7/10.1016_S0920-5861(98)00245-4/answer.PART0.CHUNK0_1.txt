[1] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts."
[2] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."
[4] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the type of support material. Specifically, when Fe2O3 is supported on activated carbon (AC), the catalyst tends to be more active in the presence of CO2. This enhanced activity is attributed to the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the catalyst surface remains partially oxidized during the reaction, contributing to its high activity in CO2-ODHP. This mechanism explains why CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation process over Fe oxide-based catalysts supported on SiO2, leading to an increased yield of C3H6 and suppression of catalyst deactivation.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受催化剂可还原性和支持材料类型的影响。特别是，当Fe2O3支持在活性碳（AC）上时，催化剂在CO2存在下更活跃。这种增强的活性归因于Fe氧化物的还原循环，催化剂表面在反应过程中保持部分氧化，从而促进其在CO2-ODHP中的高活性。这一机制解释了为什么在SiO2支持下，CO2促进了Fe氧化物基催化剂的脱氢过程，导致C3H6产率增加和催化剂失活抑制。
