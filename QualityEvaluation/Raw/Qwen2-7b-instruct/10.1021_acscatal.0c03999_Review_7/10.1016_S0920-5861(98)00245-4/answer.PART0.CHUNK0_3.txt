[1] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts."
[2] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts affects their activity, with partially oxidized Fe2O3 catalysts showing enhanced activity for the dehydrogenation of propane. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), influences the distribution and interaction of the Fe oxide catalyst with the reactants. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation process, maintaining the surface of the Fe2O3/AC catalyst partially oxidized during the reaction. This partially oxidized state contributes to the catalyst's enhanced activity in the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）过程中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中。Fe氧化物催化剂的可还原性影响其活性，部分氧化的Fe2O3催化剂显示出对丙烷脱氢的增强活性。支持材料，如活化碳（AC），影响催化剂与反应物的分布和相互作用。CO2的存在促进了该过程，维持Fe2O3/AC催化剂表面部分氧化状态。这种部分氧化状态有助于催化剂在CO2-ODHP过程中表现出增强的活性。
