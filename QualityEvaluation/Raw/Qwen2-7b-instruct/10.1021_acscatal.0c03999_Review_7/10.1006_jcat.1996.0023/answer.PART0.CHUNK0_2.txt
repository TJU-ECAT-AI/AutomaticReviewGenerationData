[1] "The objective of the research reported here was to study the chemical-physical and catalytic properties in dehydrogenation of isobutane of catalysts prepared by supporting means of increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina, both in the presence and in the absence of potash as the dopant."
[2] "The results were analyzed and compared with data from the scientific literature in an effort to form a better picture of this important catalytic system."
[3] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 600°C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."
[4] "This latter Cr61 species could be removed by a treatment with water, and thus was not grafted to the support."
[5] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chromium oxide loading."
[6] "The catalytic activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

The research aimed to investigate the chemical and physical properties, as well as the catalytic behavior of isobutane dehydrogenation catalysts. These catalysts were prepared by supporting increasing amounts of chromium oxide on commercial alumina, both with and without potassium as a dopant. The study compared the results with existing literature to provide insights into the catalyst system. The proposed model suggests that at 600°C, an initial coverage of the alumina support includes Cr61 species attached to the support, along with dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species. The Cr61 species could be removed by water treatment, indicating they do not bind to the support. Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was identified in samples with higher chromium oxide loading. The activity of the catalysts correlated with the total chromium content, except for the highest loading (15.3 wt% CrO3), which showed reduced activity.

研究旨在研究在600°C下通过在商用氧化铝上支持增加量的铬氧化物制备的催化剂的化学和物理性质以及催化行为。这些催化剂在钾作为掺杂剂的情况下也进行了制备，同时与科学文献中的结果进行比较，以提供对催化剂系统更深入的理解。提出的模型表明，在600°C时，支持层上的初始覆盖包括附着在支持层上的Cr61物种，以及分散的Cr61和Cr31氧化物种。可以通过水处理去除Cr61物种，表明它们不会绑定到支持层。对于更高铬氧化物负载（15.3 wt% CrO3）的样品中发现了结晶态a-Cr2O3。催化剂的活性与总的铬含量成正比，除了最高负载（15.3 wt% CrO3）的情况，活性较低。
