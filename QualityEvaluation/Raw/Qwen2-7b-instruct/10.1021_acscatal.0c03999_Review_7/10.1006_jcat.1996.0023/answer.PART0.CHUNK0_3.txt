[1] "The objective of the research reported here was to study the chemical-physical and catalytic properties in dehydrogenation of isobutane of catalysts prepared by supporting means of increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina."

[5] "Chemical analysis of chromium was done according to the following procedure."
[6] "The amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3, as detected by XRD, was the following (expressed as wt% CrO3): 0% at 4.6 wt% total CrO3, traces at 7.4 wt% total CrO3, 2.9 6 0.2 wt% at 10.7 wt% total CrO3, and 5.4 6 0.4 wt% at 15.3 wt% total CrO3."
[7] "It is evident that the first-formed Cr31 is spread in an amorphous or microcrystalline (XRD undetectable) phase, and that crystalline a-Cr2O3 forms only for CrO3 contents higher than approximately 78 wt%."
[8] "For CrO3 contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61 steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%)."
[9] "For even higher CrO3 contents, the increase in this species was much less marked."
[10] "Finally, for overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt% Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

The research aimed to analyze the chemical-physical and catalytic properties of catalysts made by adding varying amounts of chromium oxide onto commercial alumina in dehydrogenation of isobutane. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a computer-controlled Philips goniometer with Ni-filtered CuKa radiation. The catalytic tests were performed in a tubular-flow, stainless steel reactor under atmospheric pressure. Chemical analysis and XRD were utilized for characterizing the catalysts. The XRD revealed that crystalline a-Cr2O3 formed only above a certain chromium oxide content, with traces appearing at 7.4 wt% total CrO3 and more significant amounts at higher contents. Soluble Cr61 increased steadily with chromium oxide content, reaching a maximum of 2 wt% at 4 wt% CrO3. Cr31 was found in higher amounts at even higher chromium oxide loadings, increasing linearly with the content.

研究旨在分析通过在商用氧化铝上添加不同量的铬氧化物来制备的催化剂在异丁烷脱氢反应中的化学物理和催化性质。使用计算机控制的Philips衍射仪，通过Ni过滤的CuKa辐射获得了X射线衍射（XRD）图案。在大气压力下，在带状流不锈钢反应器中进行了催化测试。利用化学分析和XRD对催化剂进行了表征。XRD显示，只有当铬氧化物含量达到一定水平时才会形成结晶的a-Cr2O3，其中在总CrO3质量分数为7.4%时有微量出现，并且在更高含量时有更多。可溶性Cr61随着铬氧化物含量的增加而稳定增加，达到4 wt% CrO3时的最大值为2 wt%。在更高的铬氧化物负载下发现了Cr31，其含量随含量线性增加。
