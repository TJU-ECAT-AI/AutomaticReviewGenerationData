The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was analyzed in this study. Catalyst reducibility and the support materials, especially in the context of Fe2O3/AC, significantly impact the catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the proposed reaction mechanism.
