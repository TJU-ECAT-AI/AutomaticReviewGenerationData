[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene."
[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, and also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications."
[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene (3), some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst."
[4] "The catalytic tests were carried out in a laboratory, tubular-flow, stainless steel reactor, at atmospheric pressure."
[5] "Several techniques were utilized for the characterization: chemical analysis (titrimetric analysis), UVVisNIR DR spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, and surface area measurements (BET, single-point method, by adsorption of nitrogen)."
[6] "Characterization by chemical analysis and XRD."
[7] "The nature of chromium species in calcined catalysts was studied using various techniques including chemical analysis, XRD, UVVisNIR DR spectroscopy, XPS, and surface area measurements."
[8] "The amount of grafted Cr61 determined at 600°C was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."
[9] "For even higher CrO3 contents, the increase in this species was much less marked."
[10] "Also reported in Fig. 1 is the value obtained by first treating the calcined 15.3 wt% CrO3 catalyst with water, in order to remove the soluble Cr61 selectively, and then calcining the catalyst again at 600°C."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Catalyst reducibility affects the extent to which the Fe oxide can be reduced under reaction conditions, influencing the redox cycle of Fe oxide and its ability to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Fe oxide structure and facilitating mass transfer. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then oxidized back to Fe(III), catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. The redox activity of Fe(III) is essential for the reaction, as it allows for the adsorption of propane molecules, their activation through breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds, and subsequent dehydrogenation to produce olefins. The effectiveness of the catalyst in this process depends on the balance between the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material, ensuring efficient adsorption, activation, and desorption of reactants and products.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中。催化剂可还原性影响Fe氧化物在反应条件下的还原程度，影响Fe氧化物的还原氧化循环及其参与氧化脱氢过程的能力。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），在稳定Fe氧化物结构和促进质量传输方面起着关键作用。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原氧化循环，其中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，然后被氧化回Fe(III)，催化丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下氧化脱氢。Fe(III)的还原活性对于此过程至关重要，因为它允许丙烷分子的吸附、通过断裂碳-氢键激活，并随后进行脱氢产生烯烃。此过程中催化剂的有效性取决于Fe氧化物的可还原性和支持材料的性质之间的平衡，确保有效吸附、激活和产物释放。

[1] "The objective of the research reported here was to study the chemical-physical and catalytic properties in dehydrogenation of isobutane of catalysts prepared by supporting means of increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina, both in the presence and in the absence of potash as the dopant."
[2] "The results were analyzed and compared with data from the scientific literature in an effort to form a better picture of this important catalytic system."
[3] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 600°C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."
[4] "This latter Cr61 species could be removed by a treatment with water, and thus was not grafted to the support."
[5] "Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was found only for the higher chromium oxide loading."
[6] "The catalytic activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."

The research aimed to investigate the chemical and physical properties, as well as the catalytic behavior of isobutane dehydrogenation catalysts. These catalysts were prepared by supporting increasing amounts of chromium oxide on commercial alumina, both with and without potassium as a dopant. The study compared the results with existing literature to provide insights into the catalyst system. The proposed model suggests that at 600°C, an initial coverage of the alumina support includes Cr61 species attached to the support, along with dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species. The Cr61 species could be removed by water treatment, indicating they do not bind to the support. Crystalline a-Cr2O3 was identified in samples with higher chromium oxide loading. The activity of the catalysts correlated with the total chromium content, except for the highest loading (15.3 wt% CrO3), which showed reduced activity.

The research aimed to analyze the chemical-physical and catalytic properties of catalysts made by adding varying amounts of chromium oxide onto commercial alumina in dehydrogenation of isobutane. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a computer-controlled Philips goniometer with Ni-filtered CuKa radiation. The catalytic tests were performed in a tubular-flow, stainless steel reactor under atmospheric pressure. Chemical analysis and XRD were utilized for characterizing the catalysts. The XRD revealed that crystalline a-Cr2O3 formed only above a certain chromium oxide content, with traces appearing at 7.4 wt% total CrO3 and more significant amounts at higher contents. Soluble Cr61 increased steadily with chromium oxide content, reaching a maximum of 2 wt% at 4 wt% CrO3. Cr31 was found in higher amounts at even higher chromium oxide loadings, increasing linearly with the content.

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the study highlights the impact of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, on catalytic activity. The research proposes a reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the Fe oxide undergoes reduction and subsequent oxidation during the process, facilitating the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox cycle enhances the catalytic activity by providing an effective pathway for the conversion of propane to olefins, with the Fe oxide acting as a key mediator in this process. The support material, specifically AC (activated carbon), plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Fe oxide, preventing its agglomeration, and ensuring efficient mass transfer, thereby improving the overall catalytic performance.

The study reveals that the presence of Fe oxide in the catalyst significantly influences the catalytic activity, with the reducibility of the Fe oxide being a critical factor. The ability of the Fe oxide to be reduced and subsequently oxidized during the reaction enables it to effectively participate in the CO2-ODHP process. The support material, AC, contributes to maintaining the dispersion of Fe oxide, enhancing its surface area for reactions, and facilitating the adsorption of reactants and products, which ultimately boosts the catalytic efficiency.

In summary, the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the interaction between the Fe oxide and the support material play pivotal roles in the catalytic activity of the Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The optimized conditions for the reducibility and support material selection lead to enhanced catalytic performance, making these catalysts promising candidates for the efficient conversion of propane into valuable olefinic products in the presence of CO2.
