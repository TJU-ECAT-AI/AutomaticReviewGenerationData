[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene."
[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, and also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications, such as the synthesis of high-purity propylene and butenes for the polymer industry."
[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene (3), some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst."
[4] "The objective of the research reported here was to study the chemical-physical and catalytic properties in dehydrogenation of isobutane of catalysts prepared by supporting increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina, both in the presence and in the absence of potassium as the dopant."
[5] "The nature of chromium species in calcined catalysts was determined as the difference between the Cr61 and the total chromium loaded."
[6] "Chemical analysis showed the presence of three different chromium species in the catalysts calcined in air at 600°C: a Cr31 species; a Cr61 species that could be selectively removed by treating the catalyst with cold water, and therefore does not chemically interact with the alumina; and a grafted Cr61 species that is chemically bound to the support."
[7] "For CrO3 contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61 steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%)."
[8] "For even higher CrO3 contents, the increase in this species was much less marked."
[9] "Finally, for overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt%, Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the study highlights the impact of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, on catalytic activity. The research proposes a reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where the Fe oxide undergoes reduction and subsequent oxidation during the process, facilitating the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The redox cycle enhances the catalytic activity by providing an effective pathway for the conversion of propane to olefins, with the Fe oxide acting as a key mediator in this process. The support material, specifically AC (activated carbon), plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Fe oxide, preventing its agglomeration, and ensuring efficient mass transfer, thereby improving the overall catalytic performance.

The study reveals that the presence of Fe oxide in the catalyst significantly influences the catalytic activity, with the reducibility of the Fe oxide being a critical factor. The ability of the Fe oxide to be reduced and subsequently oxidized during the reaction enables it to effectively participate in the CO2-ODHP process. The support material, AC, contributes to maintaining the dispersion of Fe oxide, enhancing its surface area for reactions, and facilitating the adsorption of reactants and products, which ultimately boosts the catalytic efficiency.

In summary, the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the interaction between the Fe oxide and the support material play pivotal roles in the catalytic activity of the Fe oxide-based catalysts for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The optimized conditions for the reducibility and support material selection lead to enhanced catalytic performance, making these catalysts promising candidates for the efficient conversion of propane into valuable olefinic products in the presence of CO2.
