[1] "Wide interest was given some decades ago to this catalytic system when dehydrogenation of n-butane was the main source for the synthesis of butenes and butadiene."
[2] "Renewed interest has developed in recent years due to the increased need for isobutene for MTBE synthesis, and also because of the possibility to compete with high-capital-investment steam-cracking for the synthesis of pure light olefins for specific applications."
[3] "There are several industrial processes available for the dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene (3), some of which (the Catofin, the Linde, and the Snamprogetti Yarsintez processes) employ supported chromium oxide as the catalyst."
[4] "The catalytic tests were carried out in a laboratory, tubular-flow, stainless steel reactor, at atmospheric pressure."
[5] "Several techniques were utilized for the characterization: chemical analysis (titrimetric analysis), UVVisNIR DR spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, and surface area measurements (BET, single-point method, by adsorption of nitrogen)."
[6] "Characterization by chemical analysis and XRD."
[7] "The nature of chromium species in calcined catalysts was studied using various techniques including chemical analysis, XRD, UVVisNIR DR spectroscopy, XPS, and surface area measurements."
[8] "The amount of grafted Cr61 determined at 600°C was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."
[9] "For even higher CrO3 contents, the increase in this species was much less marked."
[10] "Also reported in Fig. 1 is the value obtained by first treating the calcined 15.3 wt% CrO3 catalyst with water, in order to remove the soluble Cr61 selectively, and then calcining the catalyst again at 600°C."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Catalyst reducibility affects the extent to which the Fe oxide can be reduced under reaction conditions, influencing the redox cycle of Fe oxide and its ability to participate in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Fe oxide structure and facilitating mass transfer. The proposed reaction mechanism involves a redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe(III) is reduced to Fe(II) and then oxidized back to Fe(III), catalyzing the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. The redox activity of Fe(III) is essential for the reaction, as it allows for the adsorption of propane molecules, their activation through breaking of carbon-hydrogen bonds, and subsequent dehydrogenation to produce olefins. The effectiveness of the catalyst in this process depends on the balance between the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the properties of the support material, ensuring efficient adsorption, activation, and desorption of reactants and products.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中。催化剂可还原性影响Fe氧化物在反应条件下的还原程度，影响Fe氧化物的还原氧化循环及其参与氧化脱氢过程的能力。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），在稳定Fe氧化物结构和促进质量传输方面起着关键作用。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原氧化循环，其中Fe(III)被还原为Fe(II)，然后被氧化回Fe(III)，催化丙烷在二氧化碳存在的条件下氧化脱氢。Fe(III)的还原活性对于此过程至关重要，因为它允许丙烷分子的吸附、通过断裂碳-氢键激活，并随后进行脱氢产生烯烃。此过程中催化剂的有效性取决于Fe氧化物的可还原性和支持材料的性质之间的平衡，确保有效吸附、激活和产物释放。
