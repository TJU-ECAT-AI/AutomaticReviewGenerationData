[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was about 3 times higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[2] "The promoting effects of CO2 on C2H4 yield were observed over oxidized diamond-supported Cr, V, Mo, Ga, and Ce catalysts (Table 1)."
[3] "C2H4 yields over this catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressure."
[4] "Maintaining a higher-oxidation state of the chromium species might be an important factor indicating high catalytic activities for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2."
[5] "To maintain catalytic activity, steam which was produced in the presence of CO2 also played an important role in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the catalyst."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the type of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/activated carbon (AC). The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. Maintaining a higher oxidation state of iron species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface are key factors for achieving high yields of C2H4 in the presence of CO2. Steam produced in the presence of CO2 enhances the dehydrogenation process and maintains the catalytic activity of the Fe oxide-based catalysts.

铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/活性炭（AC）。铁氧化物的氧化还原循环在催化活性中起着关键作用。维持铁物种的更高氧化状态和钻石表面的氧物种的存在是实现CO2存在下高C2H4产率的关键因素。在CO2存在的情况下产生的蒸汽增强了脱氢过程并保持了铁氧化物基催化剂的活性。
