[1] "In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, the roles of CO2 would be considered as follows: In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, H2O was produced during the reaction (reaction 4). Cr2O3 has been reported to be a solid acid catalyst.29 Therefore, there is the possibility of carbon deposition on the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane. As mentioned above over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, CO2 acts to eliminate deposited carbon and to remove H2 from the reaction site, thus shifting the equilibrium favorably to the product side. Another possibility of the role of CO2 and formed H2O might be the modification the acidity or the chemical structure of the surface of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under CO2, water was produced during the reaction (reaction 3). Carbon deposition is one of major problems in the dehydrogenation of C2H6. The role of water in the dehydrogenation of ethane under CO2 would be considered as follows: To obtain information regarding the effect of steam on the dehydrogenation of C2H6, steam was introduced in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence and in the absence of CO2."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the role of catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) is crucial in influencing catalytic activity. The literature highlights the importance of the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe2+ ions are reduced by the fuel molecule and then oxidized by CO2, playing a key role in the reaction mechanism. The support material, especially activated carbon (AC), provides a surface for the Fe oxide to adsorb the reactants and facilitates the reaction. The presence of CO2 assists in eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface, modifying the acidity of the surface, and shifting the equilibrium towards the product side. Water produced during the reaction helps in removing H2 from the reaction site and possibly modifies the chemical structure of the catalyst surface, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能时，催化剂可还原性以及支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）对催化活性的影响至关重要。文献强调了Fe氧化物的还原循环的重要性，其中Fe2+离子由燃料分子还原，并通过CO2氧化，对反应机制起关键作用。支持材料，尤其是活性炭（AC），为Fe氧化物提供吸附反应物的表面，促进反应进行。CO2的存在有助于消除催化剂表面沉积的碳，修改表面的酸性，并将平衡朝向产物侧移动。反应过程中产生的水有助于从反应位点去除H2，并可能修改催化剂表面的化学结构，从而提高催化活性。
