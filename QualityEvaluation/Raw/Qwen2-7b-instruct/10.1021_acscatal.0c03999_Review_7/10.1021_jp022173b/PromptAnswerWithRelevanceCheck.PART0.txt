The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the type of support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/activated carbon (AC). The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. Maintaining a higher oxidation state of iron species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface are key factors for achieving high yields of C2H4 in the presence of CO2.

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the document highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst demonstrated the highest C2H4 yield for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. Increasing CO2 partial pressure further enhanced the C2H4 yield. Maintaining catalytic activity was facilitated by the presence of steam generated in the CO2 atmosphere. The document suggests that achieving a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation process requires a higher-oxidation state of chromium species, along with the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface. CO2 plays a crucial role in eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface and maintaining the higher-oxidation state of chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface.

The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide is not explicitly detailed in the document. However, considering the context, it can be inferred that the redox cycle of Fe oxide might involve the reduction of Fe oxide by the reactants, followed by its oxidation by CO2 or oxygen species on the diamond surface. This cycle helps in enhancing the catalytic activity by facilitating the dehydrogenation process while maintaining the stability of the catalyst.

In summary, the document demonstrates the effectiveness of Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly when supported on oxidized diamond, in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The key factors influencing the catalytic activity are the higher-oxidation state of chromium species, the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface, and the role of CO2 in eliminating deposited carbon and maintaining the catalyst's stability. The redox cycle of Fe oxide likely contributes to the overall catalytic mechanism.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，文献强调了催化剂可还原性和支持材料的重要性，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的背景下。在CO2存在的条件下，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂表现出最高的C2H4产率，用于脱氢C2H6。随着CO2分压的增加，C2H4产率进一步提高。维持催化活性需要蒸汽在CO2气氛中产生。文献表明，要实现脱氢C2H6过程中的高C2H4产率，需要Cr2O3物种的更高氧化态，以及金刚石表面的氧物种。CO2在消除催化剂表面上沉积的碳和维持Cr2O3物种和金刚石表面的氧物种的稳定性方面起着关键作用。

关于Fe氧化物的拟议反应机制没有在文档中明确详细说明。然而，考虑到上下文，可以推断Fe氧化物的还原循环可能涉及Fe氧化物被反应物还原，随后由金刚石表面的CO2或氧物种氧化。这个循环通过促进脱氢过程并保持催化剂的稳定性，有助于增强催化活性。 

综上所述，文档展示了Fe氧化物基催化剂，特别是当其支持在氧化金刚石时，在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷中的有效性。影响催化活性的关键因素是Cr2O3物种的更高氧化态、金刚石表面的氧物种的存在以及CO2在消除沉积碳和维持催化剂稳定性的关键作用。Fe氧化物的还原循环很可能构成了整体催化机制的一部分。

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature indicates that the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest C2H4 yield for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure leads to an enhancement in C2H4 yield. The catalyst's activity is sustained by the presence of steam produced in the presence of CO2. The higher-oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface play crucial roles in achieving a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalysts. CO2 is essential for eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface and maintaining the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface.

[1] "In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, the roles of CO2 would be considered as follows: In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under a CO2 atmosphere, H2O was produced during the reaction (reaction 4). Cr2O3 has been reported to be a solid acid catalyst.29 Therefore, there is the possibility of carbon deposition on the Cr2O3-loaded catalyst in the dehydrogenation of ethane. As mentioned above over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, CO2 acts to eliminate deposited carbon and to remove H2 from the reaction site, thus shifting the equilibrium favorably to the product side. Another possibility of the role of CO2 and formed H2O might be the modification the acidity or the chemical structure of the surface of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[2] "In the dehydrogenation of C2H6 under CO2, water was produced during the reaction (reaction 3). Carbon deposition is one of major problems in the dehydrogenation of C2H6. The role of water in the dehydrogenation of ethane under CO2 would be considered as follows: To obtain information regarding the effect of steam on the dehydrogenation of C2H6, steam was introduced in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst in the presence and in the absence of CO2."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the role of catalyst reducibility and support materials (particularly in Fe2O3/AC) is crucial in influencing catalytic activity. The literature highlights the importance of the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe2+ ions are reduced by the fuel molecule and then oxidized by CO2, playing a key role in the reaction mechanism. The support material, especially activated carbon (AC), provides a surface for the Fe oxide to adsorb the reactants and facilitates the reaction. The presence of CO2 assists in eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface, modifying the acidity of the surface, and shifting the equilibrium towards the product side. Water produced during the reaction helps in removing H2 from the reaction site and possibly modifies the chemical structure of the catalyst surface, contributing to the enhanced catalytic activity.
