Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the document highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst demonstrated the highest C2H4 yield for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2. Increasing CO2 partial pressure further enhanced the C2H4 yield. Maintaining catalytic activity was facilitated by the presence of steam generated in the CO2 atmosphere. The document suggests that achieving a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation process requires a higher-oxidation state of chromium species, along with the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface. CO2 plays a crucial role in eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface and maintaining the higher-oxidation state of chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface.

The proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide is not explicitly detailed in the document. However, considering the context, it can be inferred that the redox cycle of Fe oxide might involve the reduction of Fe oxide by the reactants, followed by its oxidation by CO2 or oxygen species on the diamond surface. This cycle helps in enhancing the catalytic activity by facilitating the dehydrogenation process while maintaining the stability of the catalyst.

In summary, the document demonstrates the effectiveness of Fe oxide-based catalysts, particularly when supported on oxidized diamond, in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The key factors influencing the catalytic activity are the higher-oxidation state of chromium species, the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface, and the role of CO2 in eliminating deposited carbon and maintaining the catalyst's stability. The redox cycle of Fe oxide likely contributes to the overall catalytic mechanism.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，文献强调了催化剂可还原性和支持材料的重要性，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的背景下。在CO2存在的条件下，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂表现出最高的C2H4产率，用于脱氢C2H6。随着CO2分压的增加，C2H4产率进一步提高。维持催化活性需要蒸汽在CO2气氛中产生。文献表明，要实现脱氢C2H6过程中的高C2H4产率，需要Cr2O3物种的更高氧化态，以及金刚石表面的氧物种。CO2在消除催化剂表面上沉积的碳和维持Cr2O3物种和金刚石表面的氧物种的稳定性方面起着关键作用。

关于Fe氧化物的拟议反应机制没有在文档中明确详细说明。然而，考虑到上下文，可以推断Fe氧化物的还原循环可能涉及Fe氧化物被反应物还原，随后由金刚石表面的CO2或氧物种氧化。这个循环通过促进脱氢过程并保持催化剂的稳定性，有助于增强催化活性。 

综上所述，文档展示了Fe氧化物基催化剂，特别是当其支持在氧化金刚石时，在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷中的有效性。影响催化活性的关键因素是Cr2O3物种的更高氧化态、金刚石表面的氧物种的存在以及CO2在消除沉积碳和维持催化剂稳定性的关键作用。Fe氧化物的还原循环很可能构成了整体催化机制的一部分。
