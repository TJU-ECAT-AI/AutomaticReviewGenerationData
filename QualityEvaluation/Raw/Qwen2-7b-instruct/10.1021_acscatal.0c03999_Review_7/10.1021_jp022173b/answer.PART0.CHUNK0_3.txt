Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature indicates that the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst exhibits the highest C2H4 yield for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure leads to an enhancement in C2H4 yield. The catalyst's activity is sustained by the presence of steam produced in the presence of CO2. The higher-oxidation state of chromium species and the presence of oxygen species on the diamond surface play crucial roles in achieving a high C2H4 yield in the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 using Cr2O3-loaded oxidized diamond catalysts. CO2 is essential for eliminating deposited carbon on the catalyst surface and maintaining the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的表现，文献表明，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下对乙烷的脱氢表现出最高的C2H4产率。随着CO2分压的增加，C2H4产率也得到了提升。催化剂的活性通过在CO2存在的条件下产生的蒸汽得到维持。铬物种的更高氧化状态和金刚石表面的氧物种的存在对于在使用Cr2O3负载的氧化金刚石催化剂的情况下实现乙烷在CO2存在下的高C2H4产率至关重要。CO2对于消除催化剂表面上沉积的碳以及维持铬物种和金刚石表面的更高氧化状态是必要的。
