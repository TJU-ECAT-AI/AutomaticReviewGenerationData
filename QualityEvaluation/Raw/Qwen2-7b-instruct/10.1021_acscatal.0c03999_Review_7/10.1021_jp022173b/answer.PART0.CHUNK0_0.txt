[1] "Among Cr2O3 loaded-catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest C2H4 yield for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 in the presence of CO2."
[2] "C2H4 yields over this catalyst increased with increasing CO2 partial pressure."
[3] "To maintain catalytic activity, steam which was produced in the presence of CO2 also played an important role in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 over the catalyst."
[4] "The role of CO2 for the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst might be to eliminate deposited carbon of catalyst surface."
[5] "Furthermore, to maintain the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, CO2 would be necessary."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature indicates that the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst exhibited the highest C2H4 yield for the dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2. The yield of C2H4 increased with increasing CO2 partial pressure. Steam produced in the presence of CO2 played an important role in maintaining catalytic activity. CO2 also eliminated deposited carbon on the catalyst surface and maintained the higher-oxidation state of the chromium species and oxygen species on the diamond surface, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation process.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，文献表明氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3催化剂在CO2存在下对乙烷脱氢表现出最高的C2H4产率。C2H4产率随CO2分压增加而提高。在CO2存在的条件下产生的蒸汽在保持催化活性方面起着重要作用。CO2还可以消除催化剂表面沉积的碳，并维持金刚石表面铬物种和氧物种的高氧化状态，这对于脱氢过程至关重要。
