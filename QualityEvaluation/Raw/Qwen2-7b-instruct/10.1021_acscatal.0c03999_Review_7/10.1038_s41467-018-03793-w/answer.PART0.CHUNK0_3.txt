The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and support materials, particularly iron oxide on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC). The in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements showed that the metals maintain their oxidation states under reaction conditions. The density functional theory calculations helped identify the most favorable reaction pathways for the two catalyst types. Notably, at 823 K, the CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) reaches up to 98%, which is significantly higher than that of methane dry reforming (DRM) at a temperature 150 K lower. 

Fe3Ni catalysts demonstrated promising selectivity for propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt catalysts were active for DRP with high selectivity towards CO. The apparent activation energies for both catalysts were determined through production rate measurements within the temperature range of 803 to 843 K. The DFT calculations indicated that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on Ni3Pt(111), whereas the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface prefers the CH bond cleavage pathway. The Fe3Ni catalysts showed selective propylene production, whereas the Ni3Pt catalysts exhibited good activity with a strong preference for CO production.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide involves the oxidation of Fe to Fe3+, which plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of these materials in CO2-ODHP processes.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到其可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是铁氧化物在活性炭（Fe2O3/AC）上的负载。原位X射线吸收光谱测量显示，在反应条件下金属保持其氧化状态。密度泛函理论计算有助于确定两种催化剂类型的最优反应路径。值得注意的是，在823 K下，二氧化碳平衡转化率对于丙烷干重整（DRP）可达98%，这比甲烷干重整（DRM）在温度低150 K时的转化率要高得多。

Fe3Ni催化剂表现出对丙烯生产有前景的选择性，通过CO2-ODHP途径，而Ni3Pt催化剂在DRP中具有高度选择性，主要产生CO。两种催化剂的显着激活能量是通过在803到843 K的温度范围内测量生产速率来确定的。DFT计算表明，CC键断裂途径在Ni3Pt(111)上更受青睐，而多晶终止-Fe3Ni(111)表面则偏好CH键断裂途径。Fe3Ni催化剂显示出选择性的丙烯生产，而Ni3Pt催化剂显示出良好的活性，对CO生产有很强的选择性。

Fe氧化物的还原循环涉及Fe氧化为Fe3+，这对这些材料在CO2-ODHP过程中的催化活性起着关键作用。
