Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding how catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly iron oxide (Fe2O3) on activated carbon (AC), influence catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism, where Fe ions undergo oxidation and reduction, facilitating the breaking of both CH and CC bonds in propane. The support material, in this case, Fe2O3 on AC, provides a suitable environment for the Fe oxide to maintain its active state throughout the reaction. This active state is essential for the efficient conversion of CO2 and propane to propylene or syngas.

In the context of the Fe3Ni catalyst, the reducibility of Fe oxide is demonstrated by its ability to selectively produce propylene during CO2-ODHP, showcasing the synergistic effect between Fe and Ni. The catalyst's performance is consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict the preference for CH bond cleavage on the Fe3Ni(111) surface, thus enabling efficient propylene production. This is in contrast to the Ni3Pt catalyst, which predominantly performs the dry reforming pathway, indicating a shift towards CC bond cleavage and CO production.

In-situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements provide insights into the oxidation states of metals under reaction conditions, highlighting the presence of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst. This oxidation state is crucial for the redox activity of Fe, which is pivotal in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe ions are oxidized and reduced, facilitating the breaking of bonds in propane and CO2 to form propylene or syngas.

The findings suggest that the combination of Fe oxide with appropriate support materials, such as activated carbon, can significantly enhance the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. This approach not only addresses the issue of greenhouse gas emissions but also contributes to the efficient production of valuable chemical feedstocks like propylene and syngas.

Analysis of the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals several key points. Firstly, Fe3Ni catalysts exhibit promising selectivity towards propylene production, demonstrating a synergistic effect when formed as a bimetallic compound compared to monometallic Ni or Fe catalysts. This synergy is evidenced by significantly higher propylene yields on a C3H8 basis, specifically 1.6% from Fe3Ni versus 0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe. Secondly, the Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability, with less than half a percent of its original mass lost during operation, indicating that coking is not the primary cause of deactivation. Thirdly, in situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements confirm that the Ni3Pt catalyst contains metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni. Lastly, the computational analysis indicates that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the oxidative cleavage of the CH bond, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the cleavage of the CC bond, aligning with the observed catalytic activities.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and support materials, particularly iron oxide on activated carbon (Fe2O3/AC). The in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements showed that the metals maintain their oxidation states under reaction conditions. The density functional theory calculations helped identify the most favorable reaction pathways for the two catalyst types. Notably, at 823 K, the CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) reaches up to 98%, which is significantly higher than that of methane dry reforming (DRM) at a temperature 150 K lower. 

Fe3Ni catalysts demonstrated promising selectivity for propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while Ni3Pt catalysts were active for DRP with high selectivity towards CO. The apparent activation energies for both catalysts were determined through production rate measurements within the temperature range of 803 to 843 K. The DFT calculations indicated that the CC bond cleavage pathway is favored on Ni3Pt(111), whereas the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface prefers the CH bond cleavage pathway. The Fe3Ni catalysts showed selective propylene production, whereas the Ni3Pt catalysts exhibited good activity with a strong preference for CO production.

The redox cycle of Fe oxide involves the oxidation of Fe to Fe3+, which plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of these materials in CO2-ODHP processes.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到其可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是铁氧化物在活性炭（Fe2O3/AC）上的负载。原位X射线吸收光谱测量显示，在反应条件下金属保持其氧化状态。密度泛函理论计算有助于确定两种催化剂类型的最优反应路径。值得注意的是，在823 K下，二氧化碳平衡转化率对于丙烷干重整（DRP）可达98%，这比甲烷干重整（DRM）在温度低150 K时的转化率要高得多。

Fe3Ni催化剂表现出对丙烯生产有前景的选择性，通过CO2-ODHP途径，而Ni3Pt催化剂在DRP中具有高度选择性，主要产生CO。两种催化剂的显着激活能量是通过在803到843 K的温度范围内测量生产速率来确定的。DFT计算表明，CC键断裂途径在Ni3Pt(111)上更受青睐，而多晶终止-Fe3Ni(111)表面则偏好CH键断裂途径。Fe3Ni催化剂显示出选择性的丙烯生产，而Ni3Pt催化剂显示出良好的活性，对CO生产有很强的选择性。

Fe氧化物的还原循环涉及Fe氧化为Fe3+，这对这些材料在CO2-ODHP过程中的催化活性起着关键作用。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves several factors, including catalyst reducibility, support materials, and the specific interactions between the catalyst and reactants. The support material, particularly ceria (CeO2), plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity by storing and releasing oxygen, which can induce direct CO bond scission of CO2 and provide available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The reducibility of the Fe oxide, especially in the Fe3Ni catalyst, contributes to its selectivity towards propylene production in the CO2-ODHP pathway. The introduction of precious metal Pt into the Fe3Ni catalyst reduces its activity, decreases the selectivity towards propylene, and makes the catalyst unstable compared to pure Fe3Ni. The synergy between Fe and Ni in the Fe3Ni catalyst leads to higher activity and propylene yield, demonstrating a cooperative effect between the two metals. The activation barriers for oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming reactions over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts, respectively, are determined through kinetic studies, indicating the thermodynamic feasibility of these processes. The in situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) reveals that under reaction conditions, the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consist of metallic Ni. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the oxidative CH bond cleavage pathway, leading to the production of propylene, while the Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage pathway, resulting in the formation of synthesis gas (CO + H2). The FeO/Ni(111) interface is proposed as another active site for the oxidative CH bond cleavage, contributing to the overall catalytic activity. Finally, the desorption of *CO from the surface is predicted to be a facile process, facilitating the removal of carbon monoxide and promoting further reactions within the system.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及多个因素，包括催化剂可还原性、支持材料以及催化剂与反应物之间的特定相互作用。支持材料，尤其是铈（CeO2），在增强催化活性中起着关键作用，通过存储和释放氧，可以诱导CO2中直接CO键的断裂，并提供表面碳的抑制。Fe氧化物的可还原性，特别是在Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe氧化物，有助于其在CO2-ODHP途径中选择性地向丙烯生产。将贵金属Pt引入到Fe3Ni催化剂中会降低其活性、降低丙烯选择性并使催化剂不稳定，与纯Fe3Ni相比。Fe和Ni在Fe3Ni催化剂中的协同效应导致更高的活性和丙烯产率，显示出两种金属之间的合作效果。通过动力学研究确定了Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂上氧化脱氢和重整反应的激活壁垒，表明这些过程的热力学可行性。原位X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）显示，在反应条件下，Ni3Pt催化剂由金属Pt组成，而Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂则由金属Ni组成。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面的块体终止化有利于氧化CH键断裂途径，导致丙烯的生成，而Ni3Pt(111)表面的Pt终止化促进C-C键断裂途径，导致合成气（CO + H2）的形成。FeO/Ni(111)界面被提议作为氧化CH键断裂的另一个活性位点，从而增加整体催化活性。最后，预计从表面脱除*CO是一个简单的过程，这有助于去除碳一氧化物并促进系统内的进一步反应。
