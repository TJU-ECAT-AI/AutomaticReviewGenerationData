[1] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway."
[2] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
[3] "The Fe3Ni catalyst only loses less than half a percent of its original mass, therefore, it is unlikely that the main deactivation pathway is due to coking."
[4] "The in-situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni."
[5] "On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission."

Analysis of the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals several key points. Firstly, Fe3Ni catalysts exhibit promising selectivity towards propylene production, demonstrating a synergistic effect when formed as a bimetallic compound compared to monometallic Ni or Fe catalysts. This synergy is evidenced by significantly higher propylene yields on a C3H8 basis, specifically 1.6% from Fe3Ni versus 0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe. Secondly, the Fe3Ni catalyst maintains stability, with less than half a percent of its original mass lost during operation, indicating that coking is not the primary cause of deactivation. Thirdly, in situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements confirm that the Ni3Pt catalyst contains metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt consist of metallic Ni. Lastly, the computational analysis indicates that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the oxidative cleavage of the CH bond, while the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the cleavage of the CC bond, aligning with the observed catalytic activities.

对Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能进行分析，揭示了几点关键信息。首先，Fe3Ni催化剂表现出对丙烯生成的优秀选择性，显示出形成二元合金与单金属Ni或Fe相比具有协同效应。这种协同作用通过更高的丙烯产率得到证实，具体为Fe3Ni为1.6%，而Ni和Fe分别为0.4%和0.2%。其次，Fe3Ni催化剂保持稳定性，其原始质量仅损失不到一半，表明焦化不是主要的失活途径。第三，在原位X射线吸收边谱（XANES）测量中确认，Ni3Pt催化剂包含金属态Pt，而Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt均由金属态Ni组成。最后，计算分析显示，Fe3Ni(111)表面有利于CH键的氧化断裂，而Ni3Pt(111)表面则促进CC键的断裂，这与观察到的催化活性一致。
