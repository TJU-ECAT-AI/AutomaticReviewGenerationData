Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding how catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly iron oxide (Fe2O3) on activated carbon (AC), influence catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the reaction mechanism, where Fe ions undergo oxidation and reduction, facilitating the breaking of both CH and CC bonds in propane. The support material, in this case, Fe2O3 on AC, provides a suitable environment for the Fe oxide to maintain its active state throughout the reaction. This active state is essential for the efficient conversion of CO2 and propane to propylene or syngas.

In the context of the Fe3Ni catalyst, the reducibility of Fe oxide is demonstrated by its ability to selectively produce propylene during CO2-ODHP, showcasing the synergistic effect between Fe and Ni. The catalyst's performance is consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which predict the preference for CH bond cleavage on the Fe3Ni(111) surface, thus enabling efficient propylene production. This is in contrast to the Ni3Pt catalyst, which predominantly performs the dry reforming pathway, indicating a shift towards CC bond cleavage and CO production.

In-situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) measurements provide insights into the oxidation states of metals under reaction conditions, highlighting the presence of oxidized Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst. This oxidation state is crucial for the redox activity of Fe, which is pivotal in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where Fe ions are oxidized and reduced, facilitating the breaking of bonds in propane and CO2 to form propylene or syngas.

The findings suggest that the combination of Fe oxide with appropriate support materials, such as activated carbon, can significantly enhance the catalytic performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. This approach not only addresses the issue of greenhouse gas emissions but also contributes to the efficient production of valuable chemical feedstocks like propylene and syngas.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，涉及理解催化剂还原性和支持材料，特别是铁氧化物（Fe2O3）在活性炭（AC）上的作用，如何影响催化活性。铁氧化物的还原循环在反应机制中起着关键作用，其中铁离子经历氧化和还原，促进丙烷中CH和CC键的断裂。作为支持材料，这里的Fe2O3在AC上提供了维持Fe氧化物活性状态的环境，这对于有效转换CO2和丙烷到丙烯或合成气至关重要。

对于Fe3Ni催化剂而言，铁氧化物的可还原性体现在其能选择性地在CO2-ODHP过程中产生丙烯，展示了Fe和Ni之间协同效应。催化剂的性能与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算保持一致，预测Fe3Ni(111)表面CH键断裂的偏好，从而实现高效的丙烯生成。相比之下，Ni3Pt催化剂主要执行干燥重整途径，表明向CC键断裂和CO生产的方向转移。

原位X射线吸收边谱（XANES）测量提供有关金属在反应条件下的氧化状态的信息，强调Fe3Ni催化剂中存在的氧化Fe。这种氧化状态对Fe的还原活性至关重要，这是氧化脱氢过程的关键。提议的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，其中Fe离子被氧化和还原，促进丙烷和CO2断裂形成丙烯或合成气。
