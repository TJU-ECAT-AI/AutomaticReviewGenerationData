Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), we find that catalyst reducibility and support materials play crucial roles in influencing catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, is proposed as a key factor in the mechanism. The Fe3Ni catalyst demonstrates promising selectivity towards propylene production via the CO2-ODHP pathway, while the Ni3Pt catalyst shows high selectivity towards CO in the DRP. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements confirm the local environments of the metals under reaction conditions, revealing metallic states for Ni3Pt and Fe3Ni/Ni3Pt. Density functional theory calculations predict the preference of the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface for the oxidative CH bond cleavage pathway, and the FeO/Ni(111) interface for the oxidative CH bond scission. Lastly, the desorption of *CO is expected to be a facile process due to the entropy contribution at 823 K, supporting the efficiency of the proposed mechanisms.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，发现催化剂还原性和支持材料对催化活性产生重要影响。Fe2O3/AC中的铁氧化合物的氧化还原循环是机制的关键因素。Fe3Ni催化剂表现出通过CO2-ODHP途径向丙烯选择性生产的良好潜力，而Ni3Pt催化剂在DRP中显示出高CO选择性。原位X射线吸收近边光谱测量证实了在反应条件下金属的局部环境，显示Ni3Pt催化剂为金属状态，而Fe3Ni/Ni3Pt催化剂也显示出金属状态。密度泛函理论计算预测了块体Fe3Ni(111)表面对于氧化CH键断裂路径的偏好，并且FeO/Ni(111)界面对于氧化CH键断裂路径具有优势。最后，由于熵贡献在823 K下，*CO的脱附是一个易于进行的过程，这支持了提出的机制的有效性。
