<p>The presence of CO2 can also increase the equilibriu</p>
<p>Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway,</p>
<p>Exchanging Ni in the Fe3Ni catalyst with precious metal Pt (Fe3Pt) roughly reduces the activity by half, decreases the selectivity toward C3H6 to 32%, and is unstable compared to Fe3Ni (Supplementary Fig. 2).</p>
<p>The bimetallic system, Fe3Ni, however, at steady-state demonstrates propylene production from the CO2-ODHP reaction, corresponding to 58.2% C3H6 selectivity.</p>
<p>The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometallics (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst.</p>
<p>The apparent activation energies were derived by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 803-843 K. Over Fe3Ni, the activation barrier for propane CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation was found to be 115 kJ mol-1, while the activation barrier for reforming over Ni3Pt was 119 kJ mol-1.</p>
<p>The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a).</p>
<p>In these calculations, the surfaces are first modified by *O atoms assuming that *CO2 dissociates to form *CO + *O.</p>
<p>On bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111), Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission.</p>
<p>For the FeOx clusters supported on Ni(111), both Fe6O9 and Fe3O3 clusters on three layer 7 × 7 Ni(111) and 5 × 5 Ni(111) surfaces (Supplementary Fig. 12) were considered.</p>
<p>On the three surfaces studied the desorption of *CO is expected to be a facile process due to the contribution of entropy at 823 K.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves several factors, including catalyst reducibility, support materials, and the specific interactions between the catalyst and reactants. The support material, particularly ceria (CeO2), plays a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity by storing and releasing oxygen, which can induce direct CO bond scission of CO2 and provide available lattice oxygen for coke suppression. The reducibility of the Fe oxide, especially in the Fe3Ni catalyst, contributes to its selectivity towards propylene production in the CO2-ODHP pathway. The introduction of precious metal Pt into the Fe3Ni catalyst reduces its activity, decreases the selectivity towards propylene, and makes the catalyst unstable compared to pure Fe3Ni. The synergy between Fe and Ni in the Fe3Ni catalyst leads to higher activity and propylene yield, demonstrating a cooperative effect between the two metals. The activation barriers for oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming reactions over Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts, respectively, are determined through kinetic studies, indicating the thermodynamic feasibility of these processes. The in situ X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) reveals that under reaction conditions, the Ni3Pt catalyst consists of metallic Pt, while both Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consist of metallic Ni. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the bulk-terminated-Fe3Ni(111) surface favors the oxidative CH bond cleavage pathway, leading to the production of propylene, while the Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111) surface promotes the C-C bond cleavage pathway, resulting in the formation of synthesis gas (CO + H2). The FeO/Ni(111) interface is proposed as another active site for the oxidative CH bond cleavage, contributing to the overall catalytic activity. Finally, the desorption of *CO from the surface is predicted to be a facile process, facilitating the removal of carbon monoxide and promoting further reactions within the system.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及多个因素，包括催化剂可还原性、支持材料以及催化剂与反应物之间的特定相互作用。支持材料，尤其是铈（CeO2），在增强催化活性中起着关键作用，通过存储和释放氧，可以诱导CO2中直接CO键的断裂，并提供表面碳的抑制。Fe氧化物的可还原性，特别是在Fe3Ni催化剂中的Fe氧化物，有助于其在CO2-ODHP途径中选择性地向丙烯生产。将贵金属Pt引入到Fe3Ni催化剂中会降低其活性、降低丙烯选择性并使催化剂不稳定，与纯Fe3Ni相比。Fe和Ni在Fe3Ni催化剂中的协同效应导致更高的活性和丙烯产率，显示出两种金属之间的合作效果。通过动力学研究确定了Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂上氧化脱氢和重整反应的激活壁垒，表明这些过程的热力学可行性。原位X射线吸收近边光谱（XANES）显示，在反应条件下，Ni3Pt催化剂由金属Pt组成，而Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt催化剂则由金属Ni组成。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，Fe3Ni(111)表面的块体终止化有利于氧化CH键断裂途径，导致丙烯的生成，而Ni3Pt(111)表面的Pt终止化促进C-C键断裂途径，导致合成气（CO + H2）的形成。FeO/Ni(111)界面被提议作为氧化CH键断裂的另一个活性位点，从而增加整体催化活性。最后，预计从表面脱除*CO是一个简单的过程，这有助于去除碳一氧化物并促进系统内的进一步反应。
