[1] "The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[2] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[3] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of Fe oxide and the type of support material, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The presence of intimate GaOAl bonds between SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species is crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity when H2O is present. H2O promotes the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface, contributing to the improvement of catalytic performance. Additionally, H2O selectively inhibits specific reaction steps, preventing propene oxidation and ensuring the reduction of NO, thus optimizing the CO2-ODHP process.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到Fe氧化物可还原性和支持材料类型的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3物种之间紧密的GaOAl键的存在对于提高H2O存在的催化活性至关重要。水促进了催化剂表面沉积碳质材料的去除，从而改善了催化性能。此外，水选择性抑制特定反应步骤，防止丙烯氧化并确保NO的还原，从而优化了CO2-ODHP过程。
