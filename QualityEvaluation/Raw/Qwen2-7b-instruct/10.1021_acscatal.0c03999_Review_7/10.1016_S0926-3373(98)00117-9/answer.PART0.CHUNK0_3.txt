[1] "The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[2] "The promotional effect of H2O was interpreted by the following two reasons. The first one is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O. The other is the selective inhibition by H2O of the reaction steps resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."
[3] "We think that NO2 thus formed would be reduced to N2 by the reaction with partial oxidized hydrocarbon probably via the formation of organic compounds containing N and O."
[4] "Namely, there are two competitive reaction steps on SnO2 as follows: NO2  C3H6 ! NO  COx (4) NO2  C3H6 ! N2  COx (5)"

1. The presence of intimate GaOAl bonding between SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species is crucial for enhancing the catalytic activity of the SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts when hydrogen is present.

2. The promotional effect of hydrogen on the SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalysts involves two mechanisms: the removal of carbon deposits on the catalyst surface by hydrogen, and selective inhibition of the propene oxidation reaction without reducing NO.

3. The proposed reaction pathway for NO reduction by propene over the SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalyst involves NO2 being reduced to N2 by reacting with partially oxidized hydrocarbons, potentially forming organic compounds containing N and O.

4. There are two competing reaction pathways for NO2 reduction by propene over the SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3 catalyst: one results in the formation of NO and COx, while the other leads to the formation of N2 and COx.

1. GaOAl键合的紧密结合在SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3物种之间是增强SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂活性的关键因素，特别是在氢存在的情况下。

2. 氢对SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂的促进效果涉及两个机制：氢去除催化剂表面的碳沉积物，以及选择性抑制生成COx而无需减少NO的反应步骤。

3. 提出的NO通过丙烯进行选择性还原的反应途径包括NO2通过与部分氧化的碳氢化合物反应被还原为N2，可能形成含有N和O的有机化合物。

4. 对于在SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂上由丙烯还原的NO2，有两个竞争性的反应路径：一个导致NO和COx的形成，另一个导致N2和COx的形成。
