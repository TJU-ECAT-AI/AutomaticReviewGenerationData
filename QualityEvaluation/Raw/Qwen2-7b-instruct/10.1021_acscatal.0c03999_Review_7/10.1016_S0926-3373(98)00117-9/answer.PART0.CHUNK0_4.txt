[1] "As for the reaction in the absence of H2O, SnO2-doping decreased the activity of Ga2O3Al2O3 for NO reduction, irrespective preparation method."
[2] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[3] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[4] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[5] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[6] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature reveals several key points. Firstly, the introduction of SnO2 into the Ga2O3Al2O3 catalyst system significantly improves its activity in the presence of H2O. The presence of intimate GaOAl bonds between SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species is crucial for this enhancement. The optimal SnO2 loading for maximizing NO reduction activity under H2O conditions is identified as 5 wt%. Moreover, the removal of carbonaceous materials from the catalyst surface by H2O contributes to the catalytic performance improvement. Additionally, H2O selectively inhibits certain reaction pathways, notably preventing the formation of NO and COx from NO2 and propene, thus accelerating NO reduction. These findings provide insights into the complex interactions between catalyst components and the role of water in enhancing the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，文献揭示了一些关键点。首先，在没有水的情况下，SnO2掺杂降低了Ga2O3Al2O3的NO还原活性，无论制备方法如何。然而，在水的存在下，两种SnO2掺杂的Ga2O3Al2O3催化剂的活性得到了显著提高：一种是通过溶胶法制备的催化剂，另一种是在通过溶胶法制备的Ga2O3Al2O3上浸渍SnO2得到的催化剂。GaOAl键的存在是SnO2和Ga2O3Al2O3物种之间的关键因素，对于这种增强效果至关重要。在存在水的情况下，实现NO还原活性最大化的SnO2负载量被确定为5 wt%。此外，水从催化剂表面去除碳质材料有助于催化性能的提升。另外，水选择性抑制某些反应途径，特别是阻止NO2和丙烯形成NO和COx，从而加速了NO还原。这些发现提供了催化剂成分之间复杂相互作用以及水在提高CO2-ODHP催化活性中作用的见解。
