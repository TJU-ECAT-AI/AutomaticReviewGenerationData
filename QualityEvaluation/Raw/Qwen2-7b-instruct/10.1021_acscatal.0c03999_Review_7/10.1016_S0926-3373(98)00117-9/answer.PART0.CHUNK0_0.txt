[1] "The presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[2] "It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and Ga2O3Al2O3 species having intimate GaOAl bondings is essential for the promotional effect of H2O."
[3] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[4] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O."
[5] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[6] "An increase of NO conversion to N2 as well as a decrease of C3H6 conversion was observed."
[7] "The role of doped-SnO2 is considered to promote the formation of NO2."
[8] "In order to examine the inuence of H2O on these reaction steps, we measured the activity of SnO2(5) Ga2O3(30)Al2O3 for direct reduction of NO2 with propene in the absence of oxygen."
[9] "This means the participation of Ga2O3Al2O3 in the NO reduction in the presence of H2O."
