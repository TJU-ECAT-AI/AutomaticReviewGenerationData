[1] "The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3Al2O3:one is the catalyst prepared by solgel method and the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 produced by solgel process."
[2] "The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O was found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3 Al2O3 prepared by solgel method."
[3] "Transient response experiments indicated that one of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O."
[4] "Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction steps by H2O."

1. The presence of H2O significantly improved the activity of two types of catalysts: one made by the solgel method and the other made by impregnating SnO2 on Ga2O3Al2O3 through solgel process.
2. The optimal SnO2 loading for enhancing NO reduction activity in the presence of H2O, when the catalyst was prepared using the solgel method, was found to be 5 wt%.
3. Transient response experiments revealed that one factor contributing to the promotional effect of H2O is the removal of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface by H2O.
4. Another factor influencing the promotional effect of H2O is the selective inhibition of specific reaction steps by H2O.

1. 水的存在显著提高了两种催化剂的活性：一种通过溶胶法制造，另一种是通过将SnO2浸渍在由溶胶法制成的Ga2O3Al2O3上制成。 
2. 当使用溶胶法制备催化剂时，增强NO还原活性的最佳SnO2负载为5 wt%。
3. 瞬态响应实验表明，促进H2O效果的一个因素是H2O去除催化剂表面的碳质材料。
4. 另一个影响H2O促进效果的因素是H2O对某些反应步骤的选择性抑制。
