The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is significantly influenced by their reducibility and support materials. In particular, the Fe2O3/AC catalyst shows enhanced activity due to its unique structure and composition. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is central to the proposed reaction mechanism, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation process.
