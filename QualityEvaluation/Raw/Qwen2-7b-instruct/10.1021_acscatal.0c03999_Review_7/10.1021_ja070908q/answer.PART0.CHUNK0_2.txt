The synthesis of ordered mesoporous Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions with crystalline walls was carried out. The reducibility of the catalyst and the support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC, play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide is involved in the proposed reaction mechanism. This study analyzed the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP).
