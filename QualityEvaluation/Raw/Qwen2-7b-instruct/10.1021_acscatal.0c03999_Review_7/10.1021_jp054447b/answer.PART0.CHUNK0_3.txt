[1] "The performance of steam-activated iron-containing MFI zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation depends on the composition of the matrix. The Al- and Ga-containing zeolites showed a higher initial activity than the Ge-containing and purely silicious matrixes, and particularly an improved resistance toward deactivation."
[2] "The presence of Al and Ga in the zeolite matrix also provides an easier escape of Fe to extraframework position and promotes iron association at a given steaming condition (temperature and steam partial pressure)."
[3] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields and a slower deactivation than FeMFI and FeGeMFI. For identical steam-activation conditions, the presence of aluminum and gallium leads to a higher concentration of iron oxo-clusters stabilized in the zeolite pores."
[4] "The TEOM technique conclusively shows that deactivation of zeolites in ODHP is due to coke formation. Propylene is the main coke precursor, and a linear relation between the amount of propylene produced by the catalysts and the coke content was obtained."
[5] "The more acidic FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes did not lead to an accelerated catalyst deactivation by coking as compared to the more neutral FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes."

1. The performance of iron-containing MFI zeolites in the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the matrix composition. Zeolites with aluminum and gallium show higher initial activity and better resistance against deactivation compared to those with germanium or pure silica.

2. The addition of aluminum and gallium in the zeolite matrix facilitates the escape of iron to extraframework positions, promoting its association within the zeolite at a given steaming condition.

3. Zeolites with aluminum and gallium (FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI) exhibit higher propylene yields and slower deactivation rates compared to those with germanium or pure silica (FeMFI and FeGeMFI).

4. The deactivation of zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is primarily due to coke formation, with propylene being the main precursor. A linear correlation exists between the amount of propylene produced and the coke content in the catalyst.

5. Zeolites with aluminum and gallium (FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI) do not experience accelerated deactivation by coke formation compared to those with germanium or pure silica (FeGeMFI and FeMFI), despite their higher acidity.

1. 铁基MFI沸石在N2O介导的丙烷氧化脱氢反应中的性能受到骨架组成的直接影响。铝和镓含量较高的沸石表现出更高的初始活性和更好的抗失活能力，与锗或纯硅相比。

2. 铝和镓的添加使沸石骨架中铁更容易逃逸到额外框架位置，并在给定的蒸气处理条件下促进其聚集。

3. 含有铝和镓的沸石（FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI）表现出比锗或纯硅（FeMFI和FeGeMFI）更高的丙烯产率和更慢的失活速率。

4. 在丙烷氧化脱氢反应中，沸石的失活主要由焦炭形成引起，丙烯是主要的焦炭前体。催化剂产生的丙烯量与催化剂中的焦炭含量之间存在线性关系。

5. 与锗或纯硅（FeGeMFI和FeMFI）相比，含有铝和镓的沸石（FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI）在焦炭形成引起的失活过程中的失活速率并未加速，尽管它们的酸性更强。
