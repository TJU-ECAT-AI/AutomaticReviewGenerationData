[1] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites."
[2] "The higher density and strength of acid sites in the former samples did not induce a faster catalyst deactivation."
[3] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI present a high degree of iron clustering in the form of active iron oxo-clusters and even iron oxide nanoparticles, while the degree of clustering in FeGeMFI and FeMFI is much less extended and a main fraction of iron is stabilized in isolated extraframework positions."
[4] "Despite this, the former samples exhibit a marked activation procedure in the first stages of the reaction and a relatively high residual activity."
[5] "The presence of mesopores in steamed FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, as well as the small size of the resulting primary crystallites in these samples, can be also responsible for their improved ODHP performance."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC. Catalyst reducibility affects the ability of Fe oxide to be reduced and reoxidized during the redox cycle, which is crucial for the efficiency of CO2-ODHP. Support materials like activated carbon (AC) provide a platform for Fe oxide, facilitating its dispersion and interaction with reactants. In particular, Fe2O3/AC catalysts benefit from the synergistic effects between Fe oxide and AC, enhancing catalytic activity and stability.

Iron oxide clusters, especially those in the form of active iron oxo-clusters and nanoparticles in FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, show higher propylene yields and slower deactivation due to coking compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites. The higher density and strength of acid sites in these catalysts do not lead to faster deactivation. The high degree of iron clustering, whether in the form of clusters or nanoparticles, indicates a more efficient utilization of Fe oxide, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

The activation procedure in the early stages of the reaction and the relatively high residual activity of FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI suggest that their catalytic performance is not solely dependent on the redox cycle of Fe oxide but also involves other factors. The presence of mesopores in steamed FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI and the small size of the primary crystallites contribute to their improved ODHP performance by improving the intrazeolitic transport of reactants and products, delaying pore blocking by coke, and providing more efficient utilization of the zeolite crystal.

在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能受到其可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。催化剂的可还原性影响Fe氧化物在还原和再氧化循环中的能力，这对于CO2-ODHP的效率至关重要。支持材料如活性炭（AC）为Fe氧化物提供了一个平台，有助于其分散并与反应物相互作用，从而增强催化活性和稳定性。

在特定情况下，Fe2O3/AC催化剂从Fe氧化物和AC之间的协同效应中受益，这可以增强催化活性。FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI中形成的铁氧化物簇，无论是以活性铁氧化物簇还是纳米颗粒的形式，都表现出更高的丙烯产率和更慢的焦化导致的催化剂失活。这些催化剂中较高的酸位密度和强度并不导致更快的失活。

高程度的铁簇化，无论是以簇的形式还是以纳米颗粒的形式，表明Fe氧化物的更有效利用，从而提高了催化活性。在早期反应阶段的激活过程和FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI中相对较高的残留活性表明，它们的催化性能不仅依赖于Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，还涉及其他因素。蒸馏FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI中的微孔以及主晶粒的小尺寸有助于提高催化剂的性能，通过改善反应物和产物在晶体内的运输，延迟焦炭堵塞，并提供更有效的晶体利用。
