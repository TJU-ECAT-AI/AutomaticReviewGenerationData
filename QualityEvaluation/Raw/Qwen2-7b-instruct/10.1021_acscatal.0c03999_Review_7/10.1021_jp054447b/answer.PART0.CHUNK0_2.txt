[1] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites."
[2] "The catalysts, which were characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, SEM, N2 adsorption, NH3-TPD, and FTIR of pyridine adsorbed, have a very similar iron content (0.60.7 wt %)."
[3] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI require milder steaming conditions for achieving the same degree of iron extraction and clustering as compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI."
[4] "The more acidic FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes did not lead to an accelerated catalyst deactivation by coking as compared to the more neutral FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes."
[5] "The presence of mesopores in steamed FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, as well as the small size of the resulting primary crystallites in these samples, can be also responsible for their improved ODHP performance."
