<p>The distinct performance of both groups of zeolites is likely related to the different iron speciation, which is influenced by the composition of the framework.</p>
<p>The smaller primary crystallites of FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, as well as the presence of mesopores in these samples, which are created by dislodgement of aluminum and gallium to extraframework positions, appear to be also beneficial for higher catalyst effectiveness and a reduced deactivation.</p>
<p>FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites.</p>
<p>No correlation was found between the density and strength of the acidic centers and the deactivation rate. The Al- and Ga-containing samples have a 23 higher density of total acid sites, with ca. 2 and 5 times higher density of Brnsted and Lewis acidity than FeGeMFI and FeMFI, respectively.</p>

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the reducibility of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in catalytic activity. The support materials, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC, influence the reaction pathway and efficiency. The presence of Fe2O3 on an activated carbon support creates a redox-active surface that facilitates the CO2-ODHP reaction. The redox cycle of Fe oxide involves the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by CO2 and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III) by the生成 of propylene. This redox cycle enhances the catalytic activity towards CO2-ODHP. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate that can undergo hydrogen abstraction to produce propylene, with Fe2O3/AC acting as an efficient catalyst for this process. The specific details of the redox properties of Fe oxide, its reducibility, and the interaction with the support material are critical factors in determining the overall catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能，Fe氧化物的可还原性在催化活性中起着关键作用。特别是在Fe2O3/AC的支持材料背景下，影响反应途径和效率。Fe2O3在活性碳支持上的存在创造了一个具有还原性的表面，促进了CO2-ODHP反应。Fe氧化物的红ox循环涉及Fe(III)的还原至Fe(II)由CO2，并随后通过生成丙烯被氧化回Fe(III)。这个红ox循环增强了CO2-ODHP的催化活性。提出的反应机制涉及形成一个中间体，可以进行氢抽象以产生丙烯，其中Fe2O3/AC作为此过程的有效催化剂。Fe氧化物的具体还原性质、其可还原性和与支持材料的相互作用是确定整体催化性能的关键因素。
