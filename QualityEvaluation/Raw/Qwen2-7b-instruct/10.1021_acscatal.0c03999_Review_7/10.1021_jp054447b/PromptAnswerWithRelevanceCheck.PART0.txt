<p>The distinct performance of both groups of zeolites is likely related to the different iron speciation, which is influenced by the composition of the framework.</p>
<p>The smaller primary crystallites of FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, as well as the presence of mesopores in these samples, which are created by dislodgement of aluminum and gallium to extraframework positions, appear to be also beneficial for higher catalyst effectiveness and a reduced deactivation.</p>
<p>FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields (up to 25%) and a much slower deactivation due to coking than do FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites.</p>
<p>No correlation was found between the density and strength of the acidic centers and the deactivation rate. The Al- and Ga-containing samples have a 23 higher density of total acid sites, with ca. 2 and 5 times higher density of Brnsted and Lewis acidity than FeGeMFI and FeMFI, respectively.</p>

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the reducibility of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in catalytic activity. The support materials, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC, influence the reaction pathway and efficiency. The presence of Fe2O3 on an activated carbon support creates a redox-active surface that facilitates the CO2-ODHP reaction. The redox cycle of Fe oxide involves the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by CO2 and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III) by the生成 of propylene. This redox cycle enhances the catalytic activity towards CO2-ODHP. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the formation of an intermediate that can undergo hydrogen abstraction to produce propylene, with Fe2O3/AC acting as an efficient catalyst for this process. The specific details of the redox properties of Fe oxide, its reducibility, and the interaction with the support material are critical factors in determining the overall catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP.

分析Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能，Fe氧化物的可还原性在催化活性中起着关键作用。特别是在Fe2O3/AC的支持材料背景下，影响反应途径和效率。Fe2O3在活性碳支持上的存在创造了一个具有还原性的表面，促进了CO2-ODHP反应。Fe氧化物的红ox循环涉及Fe(III)的还原至Fe(II)由CO2，并随后通过生成丙烯被氧化回Fe(III)。这个红ox循环增强了CO2-ODHP的催化活性。提出的反应机制涉及形成一个中间体，可以进行氢抽象以产生丙烯，其中Fe2O3/AC作为此过程的有效催化剂。Fe氧化物的具体还原性质、其可还原性和与支持材料的相互作用是确定整体催化性能的关键因素。

[1] "The performance of steam-activated iron-containing MFI zeolites in the N2O-mediated propane oxidative dehydrogenation depends on the composition of the matrix. The Al- and Ga-containing zeolites showed a higher initial activity than the Ge-containing and purely silicious matrixes, and particularly an improved resistance toward deactivation."
[2] "The presence of Al and Ga in the zeolite matrix also provides an easier escape of Fe to extraframework position and promotes iron association at a given steaming condition (temperature and steam partial pressure)."
[3] "FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI display higher propylene yields and a slower deactivation than FeMFI and FeGeMFI. For identical steam-activation conditions, the presence of aluminum and gallium leads to a higher concentration of iron oxo-clusters stabilized in the zeolite pores."
[4] "The TEOM technique conclusively shows that deactivation of zeolites in ODHP is due to coke formation. Propylene is the main coke precursor, and a linear relation between the amount of propylene produced by the catalysts and the coke content was obtained."
[5] "The more acidic FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes did not lead to an accelerated catalyst deactivation by coking as compared to the more neutral FeGaMFI and FeAlMFI matrixes."

1. The performance of iron-containing MFI zeolites in the N2O-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by the matrix composition. Zeolites with aluminum and gallium show higher initial activity and better resistance against deactivation compared to those with germanium or pure silica.

2. The addition of aluminum and gallium in the zeolite matrix facilitates the escape of iron to extraframework positions, promoting its association within the zeolite at a given steaming condition.

3. Zeolites with aluminum and gallium (FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI) exhibit higher propylene yields and slower deactivation rates compared to those with germanium or pure silica (FeMFI and FeGeMFI).

4. The deactivation of zeolites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is primarily due to coke formation, with propylene being the main precursor. A linear correlation exists between the amount of propylene produced and the coke content in the catalyst.

5. Zeolites with aluminum and gallium (FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI) do not experience accelerated deactivation by coke formation compared to those with germanium or pure silica (FeGeMFI and FeMFI), despite their higher acidity.

[2] "The higher density and strength of acid sites in the former samples did not induce a faster catalyst deactivation."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials, especially in Fe2O3/AC. Catalyst reducibility affects the ability of Fe oxide to be reduced and reoxidized during the redox cycle, which is crucial for the efficiency of CO2-ODHP. Support materials like activated carbon (AC) provide a platform for Fe oxide, facilitating its dispersion and interaction with reactants. In particular, Fe2O3/AC catalysts benefit from the synergistic effects between Fe oxide and AC, enhancing catalytic activity and stability.

Iron oxide clusters, especially those in the form of active iron oxo-clusters and nanoparticles in FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI, show higher propylene yields and slower deactivation due to coking compared to FeGeMFI and FeMFI zeolites. The higher density and strength of acid sites in these catalysts do not lead to faster deactivation. The high degree of iron clustering, whether in the form of clusters or nanoparticles, indicates a more efficient utilization of Fe oxide, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

The activation procedure in the early stages of the reaction and the relatively high residual activity of FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI suggest that their catalytic performance is not solely dependent on the redox cycle of Fe oxide but also involves other factors. The presence of mesopores in steamed FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI and the small size of the primary crystallites contribute to their improved ODHP performance by improving the intrazeolitic transport of reactants and products, delaying pore blocking by coke, and providing more efficient utilization of the zeolite crystal.

在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能受到其可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。催化剂的可还原性影响Fe氧化物在还原和再氧化循环中的能力，这对于CO2-ODHP的效率至关重要。支持材料如活性炭（AC）为Fe氧化物提供了一个平台，有助于其分散并与反应物相互作用，从而增强催化活性和稳定性。

在特定情况下，Fe2O3/AC催化剂从Fe氧化物和AC之间的协同效应中受益，这可以增强催化活性。FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI中形成的铁氧化物簇，无论是以活性铁氧化物簇还是纳米颗粒的形式，都表现出更高的丙烯产率和更慢的焦化导致的催化剂失活。这些催化剂中较高的酸位密度和强度并不导致更快的失活。

高程度的铁簇化，无论是以簇的形式还是以纳米颗粒的形式，表明Fe氧化物的更有效利用，从而提高了催化活性。在早期反应阶段的激活过程和FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI中相对较高的残留活性表明，它们的催化性能不仅依赖于Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，还涉及其他因素。蒸馏FeAlMFI和FeGaMFI中的微孔以及主晶粒的小尺寸有助于提高催化剂的性能，通过改善反应物和产物在晶体内的运输，延迟焦炭堵塞，并提供更有效的晶体利用。
