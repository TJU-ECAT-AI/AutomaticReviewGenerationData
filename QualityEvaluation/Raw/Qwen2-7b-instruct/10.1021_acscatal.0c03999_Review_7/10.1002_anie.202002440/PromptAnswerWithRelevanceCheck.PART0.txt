[1] "The high BET surface area h-BN catalyst (72.7m2g1), denoted as BN-high, was prepared via a novel gas exfoliation of bulk h-BN in liquid N2."
[2] "There was a negligible change of BET surface area after the ODHP reaction condition treatment (Supporting Information, TableS1)."
[3] "The temperature-dependent catalytic performance of the ODHP reaction over the various treated h-BN and BOx/SiO2 catalysts is shown in Figure1 and the Supporting Information, FigureS6, respectively."
[4] "On the BN-T-high sample, the reaction started from the temperature of 500C with a low propane conversion of 0.3% and reached the highest conversion (38.2%) at 600C."
[5] "The absence of mass and heat transfer limitation in the ODHP tests was verified by WeiszPrater analysis and Mears analysis, respectively (see the Supporting Information for detailed calculation)."
[6] "Noteworthily, we detected NO on BN-T-high catalyst during ODHP reaction at 600C by using the SVUV-PIMS (Supporting Information, FigureS22), which was consistent with the GC-TCD results (Supporting Information, FigureS8)."
[7] "DFT calculations were performed to construct the reaction mechanism including pathways and radical chemistry of ODHP on the boron nitride catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. Catalyst reducibility affects the ability of the catalyst to reduce CO2 and facilitate the redox cycle, which is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), influences the dispersion of Fe oxide, enhancing the active surface area and improving the interaction between the catalyst and reactants. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where CO2 is reduced by the Fe oxide, forming a CO intermediate, which then reacts with propane to produce propene. This process includes the activation of CH bonds of propane, leading to the formation of propene through a series of surface and gas-phase reactions.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性及支持材料（特别是在Fe2O3/AC中）的影响。催化剂的可还原性影响催化剂减少CO2并促进氧化还原循环的能力，这对于氧化脱氢过程至关重要。支持材料，如活性炭（AC），影响Fe氧化物的分散，增加活性表面积并改善催化剂与反应物之间的相互作用。提出的反应机制涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，其中CO2由Fe氧化物还原形成CO中间体，然后与丙烷反应生成丙烯。这个过程包括丙烷CH键的活化，导致丙烯通过一系列表面和气相反应形成。
