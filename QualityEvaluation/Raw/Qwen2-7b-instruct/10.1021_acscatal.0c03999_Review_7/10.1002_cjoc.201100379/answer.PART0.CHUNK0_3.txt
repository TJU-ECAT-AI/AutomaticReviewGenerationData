The optimal steaming temperature of the parent HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650, and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene at 600. The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst is a consequence of high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steaming-treated HZSM-5 support. The improved stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 in comparison with in the absence of CO2 is due to the suppression of coke formation resulting from elimination of the coke by the Boudouard reaction.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the Fe oxide and the type of support material. In particular, Fe2O3/AC catalysts exhibit high activity due to the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the reduction of Fe oxide to Fe(II) by CO2, followed by the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) with the release of propylene. The support material, activated carbon (AC), provides a suitable surface for the Fe oxide particles and enhances the catalyst's stability and activity by providing a network for the diffusion of reactants and products.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受Fe氧化物的可还原性和支持材料类型的影响。特别是，Fe2O3/AC催化剂由于Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环而表现出高活性，这促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢。提出的反应机制涉及通过CO2将Fe氧化物还原为Fe(II)，随后通过Fe(II)的氧化释放丙烯。支持材料，活性炭（AC），为Fe氧化物颗粒提供了合适的表面，并通过提供反应物和产物的扩散网络来增强催化剂的稳定性和活性。
