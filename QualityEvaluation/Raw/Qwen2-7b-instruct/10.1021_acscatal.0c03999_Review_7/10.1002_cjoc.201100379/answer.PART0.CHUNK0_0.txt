The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, which influences catalytic activity. Catalyst reducibility plays a significant role, as does the choice of support material, especially in Fe2O3/AC systems. The redox cycle enhances the catalytic activity by facilitating the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ and back, promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This mechanism also includes the coupling of the simple dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse water-gas shift reaction, facilitated by the presence of carbon dioxide.

The optimal steaming temperature for the parent HZSM-5 support, having a Si/Al ratio of 25, is found to be 650°C. When 5%ZnO is supported on this steamed HZSM-5, it provides the highest propylene yields of 29.7% at the initial state and 20.3% at the steady state, during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 600°C. The enhanced performance of this catalyst is attributed to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the steamed HZSM-5 support. Additionally, the stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 is improved due to the suppression of coke formation, which results from the elimination of coke through the Boudouard reaction.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能涉及Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，这影响了催化活性。催化剂的可还原性起着重要作用，尤其是在Fe2O3/AC系统中选择支持材料时。氧化还原循环通过促进三价铁到二价铁和回转，增强催化活性，从而促进丙烷的氧化脱氢。这一机制还包括简单脱氢反应与水煤气逆向反应的耦合，二氧化碳的存在促进了这一过程。

对于具有25摩尔Si/Al比的母体HZSM-5支持，最优蒸气处理温度被发现为650°C。当在蒸气处理过的HZSM-5上支持5%ZnO时，它提供了最高丙烯产率，分别为初始状态的29.7%和稳定状态的20.3%，在600°C下进行丙烷的催化脱氢。这种催化剂的增强性能归因于ZnO的高度分散和蒸气处理过的HZSM-5支持的适当Brnsted酸性。此外，在二氧化碳存在的情况下，催化剂的稳定性得到了改善，原因是通过Boudouard反应消除了焦炭，从而抑制了焦炭的形成。
