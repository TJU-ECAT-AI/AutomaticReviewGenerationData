[1] "Alternatively, the oxidative dehydronation of propane by oxygen is free from thermodynamic constraints and can be operated at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction."
[2] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mechanism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[3] "Our findings suggest that reducing the number or acid strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can inhibit the oligomerization of propylene, thus leading to the enhanced propylene yield."
[4] "The optimal steaming temperature of the parent HZSM-5 support with molar Si/Al ratio of 25 is 650 ,and its supported 5%ZnO catalyst affords the maximum propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to prepare propylene at 600 ."
[5] "The improved stability of the catalyst in the presence of CO2 in comparison with in the absence of CO2 is due to the suppression of coke formation resulting from elimination of the coke by the Boudouard reaction."

1. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using oxygen is thermodynamically unconstrained and can be executed at lower temperatures with an exothermic reaction. Carbon dioxide can facilitate the dehydrogenation process through a redox mechanism or by coupling with the reverse water-gas shift reaction.

2. Reducing the number or strength of Brnsted acid sites on HZSM-5 can prevent propylene oligomerization, enhancing propylene yield.

3. The most effective steaming temperature for the parent HZSM-5 support, having a molar Si/Al ratio of 25, is 650 degrees Celsius. Its 5%ZnO catalyst achieves the highest propylene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the start and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane at 600 degrees Celsius.

4. The enhanced stability of the catalyst in the presence of carbon dioxide compared to its absence is due to the reduction of coke formation, facilitated by the Boudouard reaction.

5. The catalyst's performance improves when operated in the presence of carbon dioxide, as it suppresses coke formation, leading to enhanced stability.

1. 使用氧气进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应不受热力学限制，并能在较低温度下以放热反应进行。二氧化碳可以通过还原-氧化机制或与丙烷简单脱氢反应和逆水煤气变换反应耦合来促进脱氢过程。

2. 减少H-ZSM-5上Brnsted酸性位点的数量或强度可以防止丙烯聚合成更复杂的化合物，从而提高丙烯的产率。

3. 对于具有Si/Al摩尔比为25的母体H-ZSM-5支持，最佳蒸煮温度为650摄氏度。其5%ZnO催化剂在600摄氏度下催化脱氢制备丙烯时，初始和稳定状态的最大丙烯产率为29.7%和20.3%。

4. 在存在二氧化碳的情况下，催化剂的稳定性得到改善，这归因于通过Boudouard反应消除焦炭导致的焦炭形成抑制。

5. 当在存在二氧化碳的情况下操作催化剂时，其性能会有所提升，因为这减少了焦炭的形成，进而提高了稳定性。
