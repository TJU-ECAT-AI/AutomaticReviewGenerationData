[1] "The highest catalytic performance can be achieved on the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst with the HZSM-5 support steaming at 650 , which allows the maximum propyl- ene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of pro- pane at 600 ."
[2] "The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support."
[3] "Moreover, carbon dioxide can promote the dehydrogenation reaction via a redox mechanism and/or reaction coupling between a simple dehy- drogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the properties of the support material. Specifically, high dispersion of Fe oxide and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the support material contribute to improved catalytic activity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a role in the proposed reaction mechanism, involving the coupling of a simple dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse water-gas shift reaction. Carbon dioxide can facilitate the dehydrogenation process through a redox mechanism.
