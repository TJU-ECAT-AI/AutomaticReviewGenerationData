<p>The highest catalytic performance can be achieved on the 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst with the HZSM-5 support steaming at 650, which allows the maximum propyl- ene yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively, in the catalytic dehydrogenation of pro- pane at 600.</p>
<p>The superior catalytic performance of this catalyst can be attributed to high dispersion of ZnO and appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support.</p>
<p>The influence of ZnO content of ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalysts on propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 was also investigated, and the results are presented in Figure 3. It is observed that the propylene yield on ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalysts is strongly dependent on the ZnO content. The propylene yield first increases with ZnO content up to 3%, then levels off with further increase in ZnO content from 3% to 10%.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide was detected in the effluent gases. The amount of CO formed in the reaction is always higher than that of consumed CO2, but lower than twice of CO2 consumed in the reaction, suggesting that CO2 was converted into CO through both the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2H2  COH2O) and the Boudouard reaction (CO2C  2CO) during the de- hydrogenation process.</p>
<p>The amount of coke after 30 h reaction in the presence of CO2 is 1.0 wt%, lower than that in the absence of CO2 (1.5 wt%). The suppression of coke formation in the presence of CO2 may result from the elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction.</p>
<p>The full recovery of the activity after the air treatment is due to the removal of carbon species deposited on the catalyst.</p>

1. The 5%ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalyst achieves the highest catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, with yields of 29.7% and 20.3% at the initial and steady states, respectively. This is due to the high dispersion of ZnO and the appropriate Brnsted acidity of the HZSM-5(650) support.

2. The yield of propylene on ZnO/HZSM-5(650) catalysts is highly dependent on the ZnO content, initially increasing up to 3% then leveling off with further increase in ZnO content from 3% to 10%.

3. Carbon dioxide converts into carbon monoxide through both the reverse water-gas shift reaction (CO2H2  COH2O) and the Boudouard reaction (CO2C  2CO) during the dehydrogenation process.

4. The presence of CO2 leads to less coke formation, with the amount of coke after 30 hours of reaction being 1.0 wt% lower than in its absence. This is attributed to the elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction.

5. The full recovery of the catalyst's activity after air treatment is due to the removal of carbon species deposited on the catalyst.

1. 在650°C下处理的HZSM-5支持的5%ZnO催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程中表现最佳，初始和稳定状态下的丙烯产率分别为29.7%和20.3%。这归因于ZnO的高度分散以及HZSM-5(650)支撑物的适当Brnsted酸性。

2. ZnO/HZSM-5(650)催化剂上的丙烯产率高度依赖于ZnO含量，最初随ZnO含量增加至3%，然后在从3%到10%的进一步增加中保持稳定。

3. 二氧化碳通过逆水煤气变换反应（CO2H2  COH2O）和布杜瓦尔反应（CO2C  2CO）在脱氢过程中转化为一氧化碳。

4. 二氧化碳的存在导致焦炭形成减少，30小时反应后的焦炭量比其不存在时低1.0 wt%。这归因于布杜瓦尔反应中焦炭的消除。

5. 空气处理后催化剂活性的完全恢复是由于消除了沉积在催化剂上的碳物种。
