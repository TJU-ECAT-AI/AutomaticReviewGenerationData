[1] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[2] "The introduction of Fe, Cr or Cu oxides on the active carbon support by impregnation method led to active catalysts. Ni and Co oxide on the active carbon were more active in the gasification of the support than in the dehydrogenation process."
[3] "Among the used transition metal oxides the best activity was observed for iron containing catalysts."
[4] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash. The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."
[5] "Added alkaline metal oxides raised the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon. The best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio was found to be 0.1."
[6] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mech- anism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation be- tween the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations. The study reveals that active carbons serve as effective supports for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Iron oxide catalysts demonstrate superior activity compared to chromium or copper oxide catalysts on the same support material. The optimum concentration of iron is found to be 5 wt.% for maximum efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of alkaline metal oxides enhances the activity of the iron oxide catalysts, with the best atomic ratio of alkali metal to iron being 0.1. These findings align with a proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where potassium ferrite acts as the active phase, supporting the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2, as suggested by Sugino et al. The correlation between the surface concentration of potassium and catalyst activity further substantiates this mechanism.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料（特别是Fe2O3/AC）的影响。研究表明，活性碳可以作为乙苯在二氧化碳存在的条件下进行脱氢的有效支撑。铁氧化物催化剂的活性优于铬或铜氧化物在相同支撑材料上的活性。铁的最优浓度被发现为5 wt.%，以实现最大效率。此外，碱性金属氧化物的添加提高了铁氧化物催化剂的活性，最佳的碱性金属与铁原子比为0.1。这些发现与Sugino等人提出的反应机制相吻合，该机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环，在乙苯与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢过程中，钾铁氧体作为活性相起作用，支持Sugino等人的观点。表面钾浓度与催化剂活性之间的相关性进一步证实了这一机制。
