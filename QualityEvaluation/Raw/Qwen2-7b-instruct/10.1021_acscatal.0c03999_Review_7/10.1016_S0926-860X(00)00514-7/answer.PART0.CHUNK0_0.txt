[1] "The influence of the type and concentration of transition and alkali metal oxides, type of the catalyst support as well as pretreatment method on catalytic activity and stability of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene in the presence of carbon dioxide was determined."
[2] "Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to show the highest performance in the reaction."
[3] "The catalytic results of the carbon supported catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. The iron oxide catalyst showed the highest conversion of ethylbenzene varying from 4.2% at 350C to 60.7% at 550C."
[4] "In case of the other active carbon supports the activity was about four to five times lower."
[5] "The highest activity to styrene is always observed for a ratio of 0.1."
[6] "For the catalysts with an atomic ratio (Mea to Fe) of 0.05 and 0.2) to 0.800.87 (for the highest active catalysts with atomic ratio (Mea to Fe) of 0.1)."
[7] "The introduction of alkaline metal oxide promoters to iron oxide supported D-90 protected the catalyst partly against the loss of specific surface area."
[8] "The best support was the active carbon (D-90) with the lowest content of ash."
[9] "The optimum amount of iron was 5 wt.% in all cases."
[10] "In spite of a total consumption of hydrogen formed in dehydrogenation of EB suggesting fast RWGS our results are rather in accordance with the mech- anism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 based on the formation of potassium fer- rite as the active phase as proposed by Sugino et al. [14], because we have found a correlation be- tween the surface concentration of K and the catalyst activity."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors. Catalyst reducibility and the type of support material, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC, play significant roles in determining catalytic activity. The introduction of alkali metal oxides, such as lithium, potassium, and sodium, enhances the activity of the iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best activity observed for a ratio of 0.1. The support material's type, specifically active carbon (D-90), with the lowest ash content, exhibits the highest performance, with an optimal iron content of 5 wt.%. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, aligning with Sugino et al.'s model where potassium ferrite forms as the active phase, correlating with the surface concentration of potassium and the catalyst's activity.

在二氧化碳辅助下的乙苯氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能受到几个因素的影响。催化剂的还原性以及支撑材料的类型，特别是在Fe2O3/AC的背景下，对催化活性有重要影响。引入碱金属氧化物，如锂、钾和钠，可以提高铁氧化物在活性碳上的活性，最佳活性出现在碱金属与铁的比例为0.1时。支撑材料的类型，特别是具有最低灰分的活性碳（D-90），表现出最高的性能，最优的铁含量为5 wt.%。提出的反应机制涉及铁氧化物的氧化还原循环，与Sugino等人提出的模型一致，其中钾铁形成作为活性相，与催化剂表面钾的浓度和活性之间存在相关性。
