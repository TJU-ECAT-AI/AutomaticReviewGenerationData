The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by several factors. Catalyst reducibility and the type of support material, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC, play significant roles in determining catalytic activity. The introduction of alkali metal oxides, such as lithium, potassium, and sodium, enhances the activity of the iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best activity observed for a ratio of 0.1. The support material's type, specifically active carbon (D-90), with the lowest ash content, exhibits the highest performance, with an optimal iron content of 5 wt.%. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, aligning with Sugino et al.'s model where potassium ferrite forms as the active phase, correlating with the surface concentration of potassium and the catalyst's activity.

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (CO2-ODHE), the literature indicates that the type and concentration of transition and alkali metal oxides, along with the catalyst support material, significantly impact catalytic activity and stability. Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to demonstrate the highest performance in the reaction. The introduction of Fe, Cr, or Cu oxides onto the active carbon support via impregnation resulted in active catalysts. The catalytic behavior was notably influenced by the type of active carbon used and the iron content. The best support identified was the active carbon (D-90) with the least ash content. The optimal iron content was found to be 5 wt.% in all cases. The addition of alkali metal oxides enhanced the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio being 0.1. The study's findings align with the proposed mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2, where potassium ferrite forms as the active phase, based on the correlation between the surface concentration of K and catalyst activity. The decrease in specific surface area and porous volume after catalysis can be linked to the formation of carbon deposits or the gasification of the support.

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature indicates several key insights:

1. Active carbons, specifically D-90, were found to be the most effective support materials for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2. This suggests that the choice of support material significantly influences catalytic activity.

2. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) supported on active carbon (AC) demonstrated superior activity compared to chromium (Cr) or copper (Cu) oxides under similar conditions. This indicates that iron oxide is particularly advantageous for this type of reaction.

3. The introduction of Fe oxide on the AC support by impregnation resulted in active catalysts, whereas nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) oxides were more active in the gasification of the support itself, rather than in the dehydrogenation process. This highlights the distinct roles of different transition metal oxides in this context.

4. Iron-containing catalysts showed slower deactivation rates than chromium and copper oxides supported on active carbon. This suggests that iron oxide-based catalysts are more stable over time.

5. The optimum amount of iron was identified as 5 wt.% for all cases, indicating that a precise balance of iron content is crucial for achieving maximum catalytic activity.

6. Alkaline metal oxides, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), were found to enhance the activity of iron oxide-supported catalysts. Among them, the atomic ratio of 0.1 for K to Fe was found to be the most effective, correlating with the observed catalyst activity.

7. The literature suggests that the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 involves the formation of potassium ferrite (KFe2O4) as the active phase, aligning with the proposal by Sugino et al. This indicates that the surface concentration of potassium (K) is correlated with the catalyst activity, supporting the oxidative mechanism proposed.

8. After the catalytic tests, a notable change in the mass of the catalysts was observed, indicating the formation of carbon deposits or the gasification of the support. This finding is consistent with the observed decrease in specific surface area and porous volume post-catalysis, suggesting that the catalyst undergoes significant structural modifications during the reaction process.

分析在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中铁氧化物基催化剂的性能，文献提供了以下关键见解：

1. 只有活性碳可以作为在二氧化碳存在的条件下乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯的支持材料。这表明支持材料的选择对催化活性有很大影响。

2. 铁氧化物（Fe2O3）支持在活性碳（AC）上表现出优于铬（Cr）或铜（Cu）氧化物的活性。这表明铁氧化物在这种反应类型中特别有利。

3. 通过浸渍方法在AC上引入Fe氧化物导致活性催化剂的形成，而镍（Ni）和钴（Co）氧化物在支撑体自身中的活性更高，而不是在脱氢过程中的活性。这强调了不同过渡金属氧化物在此上下文中的不同作用。

4. 在活性碳上含有铁的催化剂显示出比铬和铜氧化物更慢的失活率。这意味着铁氧化物基催化剂在长时间内更为稳定。

5. 识别出铁的最佳含量为5 wt.%，这对于所有情况都是如此，表明铁含量的精确平衡对于实现最大催化活性至关重要。

6. 碱性金属氧化物，如锂（Li）、钠（Na）和钾（K），被发现可以增强铁氧化物支持的催化剂的活性。其中，K与Fe原子比为0.1时最有效，与观察到的催化剂活性相关联。

7. 文献表明，乙苯与CO2的氧化脱氢机制涉及钾铁氧化物（KFe2O4）作为活性相的形成，与Sugino等人的提议一致。这表明钾表面浓度与催化剂活性之间存在关联，支持了所提出的氧化机制。

8. 在催化测试后，催化剂的质量明显发生变化，这表明形成了碳沉积物或支持体的气化。这一发现与催化后特定表面积和孔体积的显著减少一致，表明催化剂在反应过程中经历显著结构变化。

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature indicates that the use of active carbons as supports significantly impacts catalytic activity. Specifically, the study demonstrates that iron oxide (Fe2O3) supported on active carbon (AC) leads to highly active catalysts in the CO2-ODHP process. Among the transition metal oxides tested, iron oxide (Fe2O3) showed superior activity compared to chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) oxides, indicating that Fe2O3 is the most effective component for this reaction.

The literature also reveals that the type of active carbon and the iron content play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance. The best results were achieved with active carbon (D-90), which had the lowest ash content, and an iron loading of 5 wt.%. This suggests that the optimal combination of active carbon and iron content leads to the highest efficiency in the CO2-ODHP process.

Furthermore, the introduction of alkaline metal oxides, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), enhances the activity of iron oxide-supported catalysts. The optimal ratio of alkali metal to iron (Fe) was found to be 0.1, which correlates with the proposed reaction mechanism involving the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase.

The literature also discusses the observed changes in catalyst mass after catalytic tests, attributing this to the formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support material. These findings are consistent with the oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism proposed by Sugino et al., which involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the role of potassium ferrite as an active phase.

In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts exhibit excellent performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, particularly when supported on active carbon with optimized iron loading and alkali metal promoters. The redox cycle of Fe oxide and the formation of potassium ferrite are key mechanisms driving the catalytic activity, while the changes in catalyst mass highlight the importance of understanding the formation of carbon deposits and support gasification.

在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能分析表明，使用活性碳作为支持物显著影响催化活性。文献显示，铁氧化物（Fe2O3）支持在活性碳（AC）上导致高度活跃的催化剂。在所测试的过渡金属氧化物中，铁氧化物（Fe2O3）显示出最佳活性，与铬（Cr）和铜（Cu）氧化物相比，这表明Fe2O3是此反应中最有效的成分。

文献还揭示了活性碳的类型和铁含量在决定催化性能中的关键作用。最佳结果是在具有最低灰分含量的活性碳（D-90）和支持5 wt.%铁的情况下实现的。这表明最优的活性碳和铁含量组合导致CO2-ODHP过程的最高效率。

此外，引入碱性金属氧化物，如锂（Li）、钠（Na）和钾（K），可以增强铁氧化物支持催化剂的活性。最佳的碱金属到铁（Fe）的比例被发现为0.1，这与Sugino等人提出的反应机制相一致，该机制涉及钾铁酸盐作为活性相的角色。

文献还讨论了催化剂质量在催化测试后的变化，将这种变化归因于碳沉积的形成或支撑材料的气化。这些发现与Sugino等人提出的氧化脱氢机制一致，该机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环以及钾铁酸盐作为活性相的作用。

总之，在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，铁氧化物基催化剂表现出出色的性能，特别是当以优化的铁负载和支持活性碳以及碱性金属促进剂时。Fe氧化物的还原循环和钾铁酸盐的形成是驱动催化活性的关键机制，而催化剂质量的变化强调了理解碳沉积形成和支撑材料气化的重要性。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC configurations. The study reveals that active carbons serve as effective supports for ethylbenzene dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide. Iron oxide catalysts demonstrate superior activity compared to chromium or copper oxide catalysts on the same support material. The optimum concentration of iron is found to be 5 wt.% for maximum efficiency. Additionally, the incorporation of alkaline metal oxides enhances the activity of the iron oxide catalysts, with the best atomic ratio of alkali metal to iron being 0.1. These findings align with a proposed reaction mechanism involving the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where potassium ferrite acts as the active phase, supporting the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2, as suggested by Sugino et al. The correlation between the surface concentration of potassium and catalyst activity further substantiates this mechanism.
