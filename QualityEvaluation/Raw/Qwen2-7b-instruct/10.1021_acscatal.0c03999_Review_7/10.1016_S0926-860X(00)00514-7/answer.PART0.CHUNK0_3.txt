Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature indicates that the use of active carbons as supports significantly impacts catalytic activity. Specifically, the study demonstrates that iron oxide (Fe2O3) supported on active carbon (AC) leads to highly active catalysts in the CO2-ODHP process. Among the transition metal oxides tested, iron oxide (Fe2O3) showed superior activity compared to chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) oxides, indicating that Fe2O3 is the most effective component for this reaction.

The literature also reveals that the type of active carbon and the iron content play crucial roles in determining catalytic performance. The best results were achieved with active carbon (D-90), which had the lowest ash content, and an iron loading of 5 wt.%. This suggests that the optimal combination of active carbon and iron content leads to the highest efficiency in the CO2-ODHP process.

Furthermore, the introduction of alkaline metal oxides, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), enhances the activity of iron oxide-supported catalysts. The optimal ratio of alkali metal to iron (Fe) was found to be 0.1, which correlates with the proposed reaction mechanism involving the formation of potassium ferrite as the active phase.

The literature also discusses the observed changes in catalyst mass after catalytic tests, attributing this to the formation of carbon deposits or gasification of the support material. These findings are consistent with the oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism proposed by Sugino et al., which involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide and the role of potassium ferrite as an active phase.

In summary, Fe oxide-based catalysts exhibit excellent performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, particularly when supported on active carbon with optimized iron loading and alkali metal promoters. The redox cycle of Fe oxide and the formation of potassium ferrite are key mechanisms driving the catalytic activity, while the changes in catalyst mass highlight the importance of understanding the formation of carbon deposits and support gasification.

在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中，铁氧化物基催化剂的性能分析表明，使用活性碳作为支持物显著影响催化活性。文献显示，铁氧化物（Fe2O3）支持在活性碳（AC）上导致高度活跃的催化剂。在所测试的过渡金属氧化物中，铁氧化物（Fe2O3）显示出最佳活性，与铬（Cr）和铜（Cu）氧化物相比，这表明Fe2O3是此反应中最有效的成分。

文献还揭示了活性碳的类型和铁含量在决定催化性能中的关键作用。最佳结果是在具有最低灰分含量的活性碳（D-90）和支持5 wt.%铁的情况下实现的。这表明最优的活性碳和铁含量组合导致CO2-ODHP过程的最高效率。

此外，引入碱性金属氧化物，如锂（Li）、钠（Na）和钾（K），可以增强铁氧化物支持催化剂的活性。最佳的碱金属到铁（Fe）的比例被发现为0.1，这与Sugino等人提出的反应机制相一致，该机制涉及钾铁酸盐作为活性相的角色。

文献还讨论了催化剂质量在催化测试后的变化，将这种变化归因于碳沉积的形成或支撑材料的气化。这些发现与Sugino等人提出的氧化脱氢机制一致，该机制涉及Fe氧化物的还原循环以及钾铁酸盐作为活性相的作用。

总之，在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢过程中，铁氧化物基催化剂表现出出色的性能，特别是当以优化的铁负载和支持活性碳以及碱性金属促进剂时。Fe氧化物的还原循环和钾铁酸盐的形成是驱动催化活性的关键机制，而催化剂质量的变化强调了理解碳沉积形成和支撑材料气化的重要性。
