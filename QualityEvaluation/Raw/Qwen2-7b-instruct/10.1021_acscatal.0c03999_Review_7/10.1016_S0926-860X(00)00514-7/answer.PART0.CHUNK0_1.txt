Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (CO2-ODHE), the literature indicates that the type and concentration of transition and alkali metal oxides, along with the catalyst support material, significantly impact catalytic activity and stability. Active carbon-supported iron oxide promoted by alkali metal oxide was found to demonstrate the highest performance in the reaction. The introduction of Fe, Cr, or Cu oxides onto the active carbon support via impregnation resulted in active catalysts. The catalytic behavior was notably influenced by the type of active carbon used and the iron content. The best support identified was the active carbon (D-90) with the least ash content. The optimal iron content was found to be 5 wt.% in all cases. The addition of alkali metal oxides enhanced the activity of iron oxide supported on active carbon, with the best alkali metal/Fe atomic ratio being 0.1. The study's findings align with the proposed mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2, where potassium ferrite forms as the active phase, based on the correlation between the surface concentration of K and catalyst activity. The decrease in specific surface area and porous volume after catalysis can be linked to the formation of carbon deposits or the gasification of the support.

在二氧化碳辅助下，乙苯氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHE）中Fe氧化物基催化剂的性能分析表明，过渡金属和碱金属氧化物的类型、浓度，以及催化剂支撑材料对催化活性和稳定性有显著影响。活性碳支持的铁氧化物促进碱金属氧化物表现出最高的反应性能。将Fe、Cr或Cu氧化物通过浸渍方法引入到活性碳支持物上产生了活性催化剂。催化行为明显受活性碳种类和铁含量的影响。最佳支持材料被确定为具有最低灰分含量的活性碳（D-90）。最优铁含量被发现为所有情况下的5 wt.%。添加碱金属氧化物提高了活性碳上铁氧化物的活性，最佳的碱金属/Fe原子比为0.1。研究结果与Sugino等人的假设一致，即基于钾铁氧化物作为活性相形成的氧化脱氢机制，乙苯与CO2反应，表面钾浓度与催化剂活性之间存在相关性。催化后特定表面积和孔体积的显著减少可以与形成碳沉积物或支撑材料的气化联系起来。
