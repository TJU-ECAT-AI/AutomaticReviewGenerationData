[1] "The catalytic tests showed that only active carbons could be used as supports for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of carbon dioxide."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature indicates several key insights:

1. Active carbons, specifically D-90, were found to be the most effective support materials for the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene in the presence of CO2. This suggests that the choice of support material significantly influences catalytic activity.

2. Iron oxide (Fe2O3) supported on active carbon (AC) demonstrated superior activity compared to chromium (Cr) or copper (Cu) oxides under similar conditions. This indicates that iron oxide is particularly advantageous for this type of reaction.

3. The introduction of Fe oxide on the AC support by impregnation resulted in active catalysts, whereas nickel (Ni) and cobalt (Co) oxides were more active in the gasification of the support itself, rather than in the dehydrogenation process. This highlights the distinct roles of different transition metal oxides in this context.

4. Iron-containing catalysts showed slower deactivation rates than chromium and copper oxides supported on active carbon. This suggests that iron oxide-based catalysts are more stable over time.

5. The optimum amount of iron was identified as 5 wt.% for all cases, indicating that a precise balance of iron content is crucial for achieving maximum catalytic activity.

6. Alkaline metal oxides, such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), were found to enhance the activity of iron oxide-supported catalysts. Among them, the atomic ratio of 0.1 for K to Fe was found to be the most effective, correlating with the observed catalyst activity.

7. The literature suggests that the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 involves the formation of potassium ferrite (KFe2O4) as the active phase, aligning with the proposal by Sugino et al. This indicates that the surface concentration of potassium (K) is correlated with the catalyst activity, supporting the oxidative mechanism proposed.

8. After the catalytic tests, a notable change in the mass of the catalysts was observed, indicating the formation of carbon deposits or the gasification of the support. This finding is consistent with the observed decrease in specific surface area and porous volume post-catalysis, suggesting that the catalyst undergoes significant structural modifications during the reaction process.

分析在二氧化碳辅助下的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中铁氧化物基催化剂的性能，文献提供了以下关键见解：

1. 只有活性碳可以作为在二氧化碳存在的条件下乙苯脱氢为苯乙烯的支持材料。这表明支持材料的选择对催化活性有很大影响。

2. 铁氧化物（Fe2O3）支持在活性碳（AC）上表现出优于铬（Cr）或铜（Cu）氧化物的活性。这表明铁氧化物在这种反应类型中特别有利。

3. 通过浸渍方法在AC上引入Fe氧化物导致活性催化剂的形成，而镍（Ni）和钴（Co）氧化物在支撑体自身中的活性更高，而不是在脱氢过程中的活性。这强调了不同过渡金属氧化物在此上下文中的不同作用。

4. 在活性碳上含有铁的催化剂显示出比铬和铜氧化物更慢的失活率。这意味着铁氧化物基催化剂在长时间内更为稳定。

5. 识别出铁的最佳含量为5 wt.%，这对于所有情况都是如此，表明铁含量的精确平衡对于实现最大催化活性至关重要。

6. 碱性金属氧化物，如锂（Li）、钠（Na）和钾（K），被发现可以增强铁氧化物支持的催化剂的活性。其中，K与Fe原子比为0.1时最有效，与观察到的催化剂活性相关联。

7. 文献表明，乙苯与CO2的氧化脱氢机制涉及钾铁氧化物（KFe2O4）作为活性相的形成，与Sugino等人的提议一致。这表明钾表面浓度与催化剂活性之间存在关联，支持了所提出的氧化机制。

8. 在催化测试后，催化剂的质量明显发生变化，这表明形成了碳沉积物或支持体的气化。这一发现与催化后特定表面积和孔体积的显著减少一致，表明催化剂在反应过程中经历显著结构变化。
