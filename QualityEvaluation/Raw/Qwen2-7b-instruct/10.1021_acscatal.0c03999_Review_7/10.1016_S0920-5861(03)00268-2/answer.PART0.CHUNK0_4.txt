[1] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 on the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 catalyst has been reported, and the ethylene yield was 22.5% with ethylene selectivity of 86.7% at 923 K [4]."
[3] "In the case of the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts, dehydrogenation of propane was also promoted in the presence of CO2, However, secondary reactions such as decomposition to methane, and C2, and dimerization to C4 were pronounced."
[4] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) involves understanding the influence of catalyst reducibility and support materials on catalytic activity. Specifically, the literature discusses the role of Fe oxide catalysts in the presence of CO2, highlighting that the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibit the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2. The proposed reaction mechanism involves the redox cycle of Fe oxide, where CO2 plays a crucial role in maintaining a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species, thereby influencing catalytic activity.
