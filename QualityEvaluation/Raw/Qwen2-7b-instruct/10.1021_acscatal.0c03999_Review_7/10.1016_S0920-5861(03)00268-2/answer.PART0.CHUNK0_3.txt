[1] "Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2."
[2] "Propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst were increased with increasing reaction temperature."
[3] "We propose that maintenance of the higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species might be one of the important factors for high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not directly addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the performance of Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation. The literature suggests that maintaining a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species is crucial for high catalytic activities in the presence of CO2. This implies that catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC, play a role in influencing catalytic activity, though the specific details related to Fe oxide-based catalysts are not provided.

关于Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，在提供的文献中没有直接讨论。然而，文献确实讨论了Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2辅助脱氢方面的表现。文献表明，在CO2存在下保持铬和钒物种的更高氧化状态是实现高催化活性的关键因素。这暗示催化剂还原性和支持材料，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中，对催化活性有影响，尽管与Fe氧化物基催化剂的具体细节没有提供。
