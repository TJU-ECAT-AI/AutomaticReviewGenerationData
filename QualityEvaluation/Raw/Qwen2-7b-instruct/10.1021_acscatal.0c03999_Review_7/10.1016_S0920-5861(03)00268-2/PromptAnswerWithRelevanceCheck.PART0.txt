[1] "Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane increased with increasing reaction temperatures."
[3] "In the dehydrogenation of propane, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts in the presence of CO2 afforded nearly twofold higher activities than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC systems. The oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts demonstrate the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2. The activity of the oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalyst increases with rising reaction temperatures. These catalysts exhibit nearly double the activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation process over these catalysts is to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species, potentially through a redox cycle involving these metals.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到其可还原性和支持材料的影响，尤其是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下对C3C4烷烃的脱氢表现出最高的烯烃产率。氧化金刚石支持的V2O5催化剂随反应温度升高而活性增加。这些催化剂在CO2存在下的活性几乎是其不存在时的两倍。CO2在这些催化剂上的脱氢过程中的作用可能是维持铬和钒物种的更高氧化态，这可能涉及这些金属的还原周期。

Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly focusing on Fe2O3/AC combinations. The key points are:

1. Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2. This indicates their superior performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

2. The presence of CO2 was noted to have a support effect on Cr2O3- and V2O5-loaded catalysts, enhancing their activity in the dehydrogenation reactions.

3. As the reaction temperature increased, the propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalysts also increased, suggesting a positive correlation between temperature and catalyst efficiency.

4. The literature proposes that maintaining the higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species is crucial for achieving high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2.
