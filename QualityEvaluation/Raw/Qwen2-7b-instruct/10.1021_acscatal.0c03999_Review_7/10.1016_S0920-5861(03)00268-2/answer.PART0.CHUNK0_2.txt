Analyzing the performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP), the literature highlights the importance of catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly focusing on Fe2O3/AC combinations. The key points are:

1. Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts showed the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2. This indicates their superior performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

2. The presence of CO2 was noted to have a support effect on Cr2O3- and V2O5-loaded catalysts, enhancing their activity in the dehydrogenation reactions.

3. As the reaction temperature increased, the propylene yields over oxidized diamond-supported V2O5 catalysts also increased, suggesting a positive correlation between temperature and catalyst efficiency.

4. The literature proposes that maintaining the higher oxidation states of chromium and vanadium species is crucial for achieving high catalytic activities in the dehydrogenation of alkane in the presence of CO2.

分析铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，文献强调了催化剂还原性和支持材料的重要性，特别关注于Fe2O3/AC组合。关键点如下：

1. 在含CO2的条件下，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在脱氢C3C4烷烃中表现出最高的烯烃产率。这表明它们在CO2辅助氧化脱氢过程中具有优越的性能。

2. 观察到CO2对Cr2O3-和V2O5负载催化剂的支撑效应，在其存在下增强催化剂活性。

3. 随着反应温度的升高，含氧化金刚石的V2O5催化剂上的丙烯产率也增加，表明温度与催化剂效率之间存在正相关性。

4. 文献提出，维持铬和钒物种的更高氧化状态是实现CO2存在下烷烃脱氢过程高催化活性的关键因素。
