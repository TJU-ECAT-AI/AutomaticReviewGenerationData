[1] "Among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibited the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2."
[2] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes over the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts might be to maintain a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is not specifically addressed in the literature. However, it is noted that among oxidized diamond-supported metal oxide catalysts, the oxidized diamond-supported Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts exhibit the highest alkene yield for the dehydrogenation of C3C4 alkanes in the presence of CO2. The role of CO2 in the process might involve maintaining a higher oxidation state of chromium and vanadium species.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能没有在文献中具体提到。然而，文献指出，在氧化金刚石支持的金属氧化物催化剂中，氧化金刚石支持的Cr2O3和V2O5催化剂在CO2存在下对C3C4烷烃的脱氢反应表现出最高的烯烃产率。CO2的作用可能在于维持铬和钒物种的较高氧化态。
