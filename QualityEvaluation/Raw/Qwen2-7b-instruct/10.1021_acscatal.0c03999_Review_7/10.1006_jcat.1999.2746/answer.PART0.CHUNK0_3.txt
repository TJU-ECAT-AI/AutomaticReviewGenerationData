[1] "Clearly, O2 is more efficient than CO2; still, the pulse reactor data demonstrate that the extent of reoxidation by CO2 is significant."
[2] "The fact that the rates are so similar on Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia, strongly suggests that the mechanisms must also be similar."
[3] "While we have not definitively proven that the reduced Pd/ceria can adsorb CO2 and release it upon re-oxidation, the concept is reminiscent of what is observed with sulfur."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the type of support material used, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in this process, allowing the adsorption and subsequent release of CO2 upon re-oxidation, akin to sulfur's behavior. This cycle is essential for the efficiency of CO2-ODHP, demonstrating that the extent of reoxidation by CO2 is significant despite O2 being more efficient. The similar rates observed on Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia suggest that their mechanisms for CO2 reforming of methane are also similar, implying that the redox mechanisms might be applicable to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. The ability of Fe oxide to form a carbonate, similar to its behavior with sulfur, may be indicative of its tolerance towards SO2, further emphasizing the importance of the redox properties of the catalyst.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性及其支持材料类型的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC中。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环对于这一过程至关重要，允许CO2的吸附和随后在重新氧化时释放，类似于硫的行为。这一循环对于CO2-ODHP的效率至关重要，表明CO2的再氧化程度虽然CO2比O2更有效，但仍然显著。Pd/ceria和Pd/zirconia上观察到的相似速率强烈表明它们的CO2甲烷重整机制也相似，暗示应用于Fe氧化物基催化剂的CO2-ODHP的氧化还原机制。Fe氧化物形成碳酸盐的能力，类似于其对SO2的行为，可能表明它对SO2的耐受性，进一步强调了催化剂氧化还原性质的重要性。
