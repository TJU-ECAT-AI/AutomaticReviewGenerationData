[1] "Clearly, O2 is more efficient than CO2; still, the pulse reactor data demonstrate that the extent of re-oxidation by CO2 is significant."
[2] "These results have obvious implications for the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2."
[3] "The fact that the rates are so similar on Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia, strongly suggests that the mechanisms must also be similar."
[4] "The simplicity of the redox mechanism, along with the fact that both the oxidation and reduction steps are observed directly in the pulse measurements, strongly argues for the redox mechanism."
[5] "While we have not definitively proven that the reduced Pd/ceria can adsorb CO2 and release it upon re-oxidation, the concept is reminiscent of what is observed with sulfur."

In the study, the authors investigated the oxidation and reduction of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia catalysts using pulse-reactor studies. They found that both ceria and zirconia can be partially reduced by CO and partially reoxidized by CO2. The results demonstrated that CO2 is capable of oxidizing reduced ceria or zirconia, albeit less efficiently than O2. This finding has implications for the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2. Moreover, the high activities of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia catalysts, particularly for methane reforming, are attributed to their ability to undergo oxidation and reduction reactions. The study also highlights the importance of considering the potential effects of CO2 and H2O in automotive exhaust environments on the equilibrium oxidation state of ceria components, which may limit the extent of oxygen removal.

在研究中，作者使用脉冲反应器研究了Pd/ceria和Pd/zirconia催化剂的氧化和还原。他们发现，无论是铈还是锆都可以部分由CO还原，部分由CO2氧化。结果表明，CO2能够氧化还原态的铈或锆，尽管效率低于O2。这一发现对CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的机制有影响。此外，Pd/ceria和Pd/zirconia催化剂的高活性，特别是对于甲烷改质，归因于它们能够进行氧化和还原反应的能力。研究还强调了考虑汽车排气环境中CO2和H2O的存在对铈成分氧化状态平衡的影响的重要性，这可能限制氧气的去除程度。
