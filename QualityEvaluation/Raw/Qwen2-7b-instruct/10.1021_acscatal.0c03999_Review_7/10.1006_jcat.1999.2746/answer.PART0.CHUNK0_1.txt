The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was not specifically addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the impact of catalyst reducibility and support materials on catalytic activity. Specifically, it notes that the Pd/ceria catalyst was more active than the Pd/zirconia catalyst, and 104 times more active than the Pd/silica catalyst. This increased activity is attributed to the oxidation and reduction processes occurring within the supports.

The literature also highlights the significant extent of reoxidation by CO2, suggesting that CO2 can effectively oxidize reduced ceria or zirconia. This finding has implications for understanding the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2 and its effects on three-way automotive exhaust catalysis. It implies that the presence of CO2 and H2O in the exhaust environment may affect the equilibrium oxidation state of the ceria component, potentially limiting the extent to which oxygen can be removed.

The redox mechanism involving the oxidation and reduction of Fe oxide is not directly mentioned, but the literature's discussion of similar redox processes in ceria and zirconia provides context. The redox properties of Fe oxide could potentially play a role in CO2-ODHP, much like they do in the reactions described for ceria and zirconia. The ability of Fe oxide to form a sulfate or carbonate might be related to its behavior in CO2-ODHP, similar to the observed behavior of ceria and zirconia.

Answering the specific question about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP would require a detailed analysis of the catalyst's reducibility, support material properties, and the reaction mechanism, which is not provided in the given literature.

关于铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，提供的文献没有直接讨论。然而，文献确实探讨了催化剂可还原性和支撑材料对催化活性的影响。具体而言，它指出钯/氧化铈催化剂比钯/氧化锆催化剂更活跃，并且是钯/二氧化硅催化剂的104倍。这种增加的活性归因于支持物的氧化和还原过程。

文献还强调了二氧化碳再氧化的显著程度，表明二氧化碳可以有效氧化还原态的铈或锆。这一发现对于理解甲烷通过二氧化碳的改革机制以及其对三元汽车排气催化的影响有重要意义。它表明，废气环境中存在的二氧化碳和水可能会影响铈成分的氧化状态平衡，从而限制氧气的去除程度。

铁氧化物的氧化还原性质可能在CO2-ODHP中发挥作用，类似于它们在铈和锆反应中所描述的情况。铁氧化物形成硫酸盐或碳酸盐的能力可能与它的CO2-ODHP行为有关，类似于观察到的铈和锆的行为。

回答关于铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的特定问题需要详细分析催化剂的可还原性、支撑材料特性以及反应机制，这在给定的文献中并未提供。
