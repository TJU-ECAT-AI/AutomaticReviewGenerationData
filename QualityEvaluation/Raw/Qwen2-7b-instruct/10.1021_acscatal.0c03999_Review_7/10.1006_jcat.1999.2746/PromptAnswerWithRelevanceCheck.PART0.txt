[1] "The oxidation and reduction of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia catalysts were investigated using pulse-reactor studies in which products were monitored following step changes in the reactant composition."
[2] "The Pd/ceria catalyst was slightly more active than Pd/zirconia and 104 times as active as Pd/silica."
[3] "The high activities of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia are explained as resulting from oxidation and reduction of the supports."
[4] "Clearly, O2 is more efficient than CO2; still, the pulse reactor data demonstrate that the extent of reoxidation by CO2 is significant."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was not specifically addressed in the provided literature. However, the literature does discuss the impact of catalyst reducibility and support materials on catalytic activity. Specifically, it notes that the Pd/ceria catalyst was more active than the Pd/zirconia catalyst, and 104 times more active than the Pd/silica catalyst. This increased activity is attributed to the oxidation and reduction processes occurring within the supports.

The literature also highlights the significant extent of reoxidation by CO2, suggesting that CO2 can effectively oxidize reduced ceria or zirconia. This finding has implications for understanding the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2 and its effects on three-way automotive exhaust catalysis. It implies that the presence of CO2 and H2O in the exhaust environment may affect the equilibrium oxidation state of the ceria component, potentially limiting the extent to which oxygen can be removed.

The redox mechanism involving the oxidation and reduction of Fe oxide is not directly mentioned, but the literature's discussion of similar redox processes in ceria and zirconia provides context. The redox properties of Fe oxide could potentially play a role in CO2-ODHP, much like they do in the reactions described for ceria and zirconia. The ability of Fe oxide to form a sulfate or carbonate might be related to its behavior in CO2-ODHP, similar to the observed behavior of ceria and zirconia.

Answering the specific question about Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP would require a detailed analysis of the catalyst's reducibility, support material properties, and the reaction mechanism, which is not provided in the given literature.

关于铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能，提供的文献没有直接讨论。然而，文献确实探讨了催化剂可还原性和支撑材料对催化活性的影响。具体而言，它指出钯/氧化铈催化剂比钯/氧化锆催化剂更活跃，并且是钯/二氧化硅催化剂的104倍。这种增加的活性归因于支持物的氧化和还原过程。

文献还强调了二氧化碳再氧化的显著程度，表明二氧化碳可以有效氧化还原态的铈或锆。这一发现对于理解甲烷通过二氧化碳的改革机制以及其对三元汽车排气催化的影响有重要意义。它表明，废气环境中存在的二氧化碳和水可能会影响铈成分的氧化状态平衡，从而限制氧气的去除程度。

铁氧化物的氧化还原性质可能在CO2-ODHP中发挥作用，类似于它们在铈和锆反应中所描述的情况。铁氧化物形成硫酸盐或碳酸盐的能力可能与它的CO2-ODHP行为有关，类似于观察到的铈和锆的行为。

回答关于铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的特定问题需要详细分析催化剂的可还原性、支撑材料特性以及反应机制，这在给定的文献中并未提供。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the type of support material, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC systems. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in this process. The efficiency of CO2 in reoxidizing the reduced Fe oxide is significant, indicating its potential impact on the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2. The simplicity and direct observation of both oxidation and reduction steps in the pulse measurements support the redox mechanism in these catalytic processes. This implies that the Fe oxide-based catalysts, when exposed to CO2, exhibit a redox behavior that facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料类型的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在这一过程中起着关键作用。二氧化碳在重新氧化减少的Fe氧化物方面的效率是显著的，这表明它对CO2辅助甲烷重整机制的潜在影响。脉冲测量中直接观察到的氧化和还原步骤的简单性支持了这种氧化还原机制。这意味着当Fe氧化物基催化剂暴露于二氧化碳时，表现出一种氧化还原行为，促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by the reducibility of the catalyst and the type of support material used, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in this process, allowing the adsorption and subsequent release of CO2 upon re-oxidation, akin to sulfur's behavior. This cycle is essential for the efficiency of CO2-ODHP, demonstrating that the extent of reoxidation by CO2 is significant despite O2 being more efficient. The similar rates observed on Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia suggest that their mechanisms for CO2 reforming of methane are also similar, implying that the redox mechanisms might be applicable to Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-ODHP. The ability of Fe oxide to form a carbonate, similar to its behavior with sulfur, may be indicative of its tolerance towards SO2, further emphasizing the importance of the redox properties of the catalyst.

In the study, the authors investigated the oxidation and reduction of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia catalysts using pulse-reactor studies. They found that both ceria and zirconia can be partially reduced by CO and partially reoxidized by CO2. The results demonstrated that CO2 is capable of oxidizing reduced ceria or zirconia, albeit less efficiently than O2. This finding has implications for the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2. Moreover, the high activities of Pd/ceria and Pd/zirconia catalysts, particularly for methane reforming, are attributed to their ability to undergo oxidation and reduction reactions. The study also highlights the importance of considering the potential effects of CO2 and H2O in automotive exhaust environments on the equilibrium oxidation state of ceria components, which may limit the extent of oxygen removal.

在研究中，作者使用脉冲反应器研究了Pd/ceria和Pd/zirconia催化剂的氧化和还原。他们发现，无论是铈还是锆都可以部分由CO还原，部分由CO2氧化。结果表明，CO2能够氧化还原态的铈或锆，尽管效率低于O2。这一发现对CO2辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的机制有影响。此外，Pd/ceria和Pd/zirconia催化剂的高活性，特别是对于甲烷改质，归因于它们能够进行氧化和还原反应的能力。研究还强调了考虑汽车排气环境中CO2和H2O的存在对铈成分氧化状态平衡的影响的重要性，这可能限制氧气的去除程度。
