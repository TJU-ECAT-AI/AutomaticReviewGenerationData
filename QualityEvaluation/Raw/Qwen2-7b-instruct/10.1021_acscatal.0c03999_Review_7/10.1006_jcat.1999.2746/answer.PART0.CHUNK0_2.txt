[1] "Clearly, O2 is more efficient than CO2; still, the pulse reactor data demonstrate that the extent of reoxidation by CO2 is significant."
[2] "These results have obvious implications for the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2."
[3] "While it is possible that this role is simply to polarize molecules adsorbed at the metalzirconia interface, the simplicity of the redox mechanism, along with the fact that both the oxidation and reduction steps are observed directly in the pulse measurements, strongly argues for the redox mechanism."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the type of support material, particularly in the context of Fe2O3/AC systems. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in this process. The efficiency of CO2 in reoxidizing the reduced Fe oxide is significant, indicating its potential impact on the mechanism of methane reforming by CO2. The simplicity and direct observation of both oxidation and reduction steps in the pulse measurements support the redox mechanism in these catalytic processes. This implies that the Fe oxide-based catalysts, when exposed to CO2, exhibit a redox behavior that facilitates the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到其可还原性和支撑材料类型的影响，特别是在Fe2O3/AC系统中。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环在这一过程中起着关键作用。二氧化碳在重新氧化减少的Fe氧化物方面的效率是显著的，这表明它对CO2辅助甲烷重整机制的潜在影响。脉冲测量中直接观察到的氧化和还原步骤的简单性支持了这种氧化还原机制。这意味着当Fe氧化物基催化剂暴露于二氧化碳时，表现出一种氧化还原行为，促进了丙烷的氧化脱氢。
