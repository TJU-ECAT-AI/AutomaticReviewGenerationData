The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic process, which involves the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and subsequent oxidation back to Fe(III).
