2.1. Materials preparation

The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was obtained by calcination of tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) parent zeolite in air at 550°C for 15 h. The SiBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000 was obtained by a treatment of TEABeta with 13 mol L−1 HNO3 solution at 80°C for 4 h, washed with distilled water and dried at 95°C overnight.

2.2. Materials characterization

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of supports and catalysts were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 154,05 pm) in 2θ range of 5–45°.

Analysis of the acidic properties of samples was performed by adsorption of pyridine (Py) followed by infrared spectroscopy.

29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz with Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer and 7 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 5 kHz.

Tetramethylsilane was used as reference. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a 4.2 μs excitation pulse and a 10 s recycle delay. 27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were performed using a 4 mm zirconia rotors spinning at 12 kHz. The resonance frequency of 500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz were used for recording of 1H and 27Al, respectively.

An aqueous Al(NO3)3 1 N solution was used as second

The AlBeta support with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 17 was created by calcining tetraethylammonium Beta (TEABeta) in air at 550°C for 15 hours. The SiBeta support, with a Si/Al atomic ratio of 1000, was obtained through a 4-hour treatment of TEABeta with a 13 mol/L HNO3 solution at 80°C. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was utilized to analyze the supports and catalysts. The acidic properties of the samples were assessed using pyridine adsorption followed by infrared spectroscopy. 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 99.3 MHz using a Bruker AVANCE 500 spectrometer. 27Al and 1H MAS NMR experiments were conducted at 500.16 MHz and 130.33 MHz, respectively. An aqueous Al(NO3)3 1 N solution served as the secondary material.
