The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. High dispersion of Fe oxide species on the support is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a significant role in the reaction mechanism, involving transitions between oxidized and reduced forms of Fe, such as Fe(III)/Fe(II), Fe(VI)/Fe(III), or Fe(V)/Fe(III). Over γ-Al2O3-supported Fe oxide catalysts, the addition of CO2 has a poisoning effect, limiting their applicability in CO2-ODHP. In contrast, the use of AC as a support might allow better dispersion and stability of Fe oxide, enhancing the catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。铁氧化物物种在支撑上的高分散是实现高效催化性能的关键。铁氧化物的氧化还原循环在反应机制中起着重要作用，涉及Fe(III)/Fe(II)、Fe(VI)/Fe(III)或Fe(V)/Fe(III)等氧化还原形式之间的转换。γ-Al2O3支持的Fe氧化物催化剂中，二氧化碳的添加具有毒害效应，限制了其在CO2-ODHP中的应用。相比之下，使用AC作为支持物可能允许更好的Fe氧化物分散和稳定性，从而增强CO2-ODHP的催化活性。
