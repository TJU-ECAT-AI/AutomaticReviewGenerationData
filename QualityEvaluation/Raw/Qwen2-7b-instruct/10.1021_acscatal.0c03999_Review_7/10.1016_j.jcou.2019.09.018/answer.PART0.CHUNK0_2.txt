The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the type of support materials. Catalysts based on Fe2O3/active carbon (AC) exhibit specific properties that affect their catalytic activity. The reducibility of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the redox cycle involved in the reaction mechanism. This mechanism proposes that the Fe oxide undergoes redox reactions between the oxidized/reduced forms, such as Fe(III)/Fe(II), contributing to the production of propene. The support material, particularly AC, influences the dispersion of Fe oxide species, impacting the overall catalytic performance. High dispersion ensures better access to reactants and products, enhancing the conversion efficiency. However, the addition of CO2 in the presence of Fe oxide-based catalysts can lead to poisoning effects, affecting the catalyst's performance. On the contrary, the use of Beta zeolites, after dealumination, provides an excellent platform for chromium dispersion, leading to efficient CO2-PDH catalysis.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到其还原性和支撑材料的影响。基于Fe2O3/活性碳（AC）的催化剂具有特定性质，影响其催化活性。Fe氧化物的可还原性在反应机制涉及的还原循环中起关键作用。该机制提出，Fe氧化物经历Fe(III)/Fe(II)等氧化还原形式之间的红ox反应，促进丙烯的生成。支撑材料，尤其是AC，影响Fe氧化物物种的分散，影响整体催化性能。高分散确保了反应物和产物的更好访问，提高了转化效率。然而，在Fe氧化物基催化剂的存在下添加CO2可能导致中毒效应，影响催化剂的性能。相反，使用去铝化的Beta沸石提供了良好的平台，用于铬的分散，导致有效的CO2-PDH催化。
