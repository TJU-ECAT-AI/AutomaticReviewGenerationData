Cr oxide-based catalysts, especially those with dealuminated Beta zeolites, exhibit high activity and selectivity in CO2-PDH. The presence of redox chromium species and high dispersion contribute significantly to their catalytic performance. Contrary to γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, Cr oxide catalysts over active carbon are more effective in CO2-PDH processes. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent simple impregnation with chromium oxide results in highly efficient catalysts for CO2-PDH.

铬氧化物基催化剂，特别是以去铝化贝塔沸石为载体的催化剂，在二氧化碳辅助下进行丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性和选择性。红氧化合物的存在和高分散性对它们的催化性能有重要贡献。与γ-Al2O3支持的催化剂相比，铬氧化物催化剂在活性碳上的应用更适合于CO2-PDH过程。通过去铝化贝塔沸石并随后简单浸渍铬氧化物的方法可以得到高效催化剂用于CO2-PDH。
