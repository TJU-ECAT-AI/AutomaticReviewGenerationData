<p>The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed.</p>
<p>In the oxidative pathway various redox cycles between the oxidised/reduced forms of Cr sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III) or Cr(V)/Cr (III) has been suggested.</p>
<p>It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.</p>

The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves both non-oxidative dehydrogenation with the participation of Cr(II) or Cr(III) species and various redox mechanisms where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant. Redox cycles between oxidized and reduced forms of chromium sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), are proposed. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

在CO2的存在下，丙烷脱氢的机制既包括非氧化性脱氢，其中Cr(II)或Cr(III)物种参与，也包括各种氧化机制，其中CO2作为温和的氧化剂参与。提出了氧化脱氢途径中Cr位点氧化和还原形式之间的红ox循环，如Cr(III)/Cr(II)、Cr(VI)/Cr(III)或Cr(V)/Cr(III)。高度分散以及红ox铬物种的存在对于实现CO2-PDH的高催化性能至关重要。
