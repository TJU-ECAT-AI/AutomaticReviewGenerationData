The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves both non-oxidative dehydrogenation with the participation of Cr(II) or Cr(III) species and various redox mechanisms where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant. Redox cycles between oxidized and reduced forms of chromium sites, such as Cr(III)/Cr(II), Cr(VI)/Cr(III), or Cr(V)/Cr(III), are proposed. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are crucial for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.

Cr oxide-based catalysts, especially those with dealuminated Beta zeolites, exhibit high activity and selectivity in CO2-PDH. The presence of redox chromium species and high dispersion contribute significantly to their catalytic performance. Contrary to γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts, Cr oxide catalysts over active carbon are more effective in CO2-PDH processes. Dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent simple impregnation with chromium oxide results in highly efficient catalysts for CO2-PDH.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the type of support materials. Catalysts based on Fe2O3/active carbon (AC) exhibit specific properties that affect their catalytic activity. The reducibility of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the redox cycle involved in the reaction mechanism. This mechanism proposes that the Fe oxide undergoes redox reactions between the oxidized/reduced forms, such as Fe(III)/Fe(II), contributing to the production of propene. The support material, particularly AC, influences the dispersion of Fe oxide species, impacting the overall catalytic performance. High dispersion ensures better access to reactants and products, enhancing the conversion efficiency. However, the addition of CO2 in the presence of Fe oxide-based catalysts can lead to poisoning effects, affecting the catalyst's performance. On the contrary, the use of Beta zeolites, after dealumination, provides an excellent platform for chromium dispersion, leading to efficient CO2-PDH catalysis.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. High dispersion of Fe oxide species on the support is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a significant role in the reaction mechanism, involving transitions between oxidized and reduced forms of Fe, such as Fe(III)/Fe(II), Fe(VI)/Fe(III), or Fe(V)/Fe(III). Over γ-Al2O3-supported Fe oxide catalysts, the addition of CO2 has a poisoning effect, limiting their applicability in CO2-ODHP. In contrast, the use of AC as a support might allow better dispersion and stability of Fe oxide, enhancing the catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。铁氧化物物种在支撑上的高分散是实现高效催化性能的关键。铁氧化物的氧化还原循环在反应机制中起着重要作用，涉及Fe(III)/Fe(II)、Fe(VI)/Fe(III)或Fe(V)/Fe(III)等氧化还原形式之间的转换。γ-Al2O3支持的Fe氧化物催化剂中，二氧化碳的添加具有毒害效应，限制了其在CO2-ODHP中的应用。相比之下，使用AC作为支持物可能允许更好的Fe氧化物分散和稳定性，从而增强CO2-ODHP的催化活性。
