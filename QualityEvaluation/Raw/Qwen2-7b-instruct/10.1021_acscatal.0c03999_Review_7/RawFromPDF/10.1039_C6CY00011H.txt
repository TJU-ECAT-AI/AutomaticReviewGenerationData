Partial oxidation of propane with CO2 on Ru
doped catalysts†
Sivaram Pradhan,‡a David C. Upham,b Horia Metiub and Eric W. McFarland*a
The catalytic activity and stability of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped ZrO2 are investigated and compared for
the partial oxidation of propane using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. On both the reducible Ru doped ceria
and the irreducible Ru doped zirconia catalysts, the major products of propane partial oxidation were CO and
H2 when CO2 is used as an oxidant, and the two catalysts had comparable activity below 450 °C. In addition
to dry reforming products, the Ru doped CeO2 produced small quantities of methane above 450 °C. Neither
catalyst showed measurable selectivity for oxidative dehydrogenation activity of propane-to-propylene with
CO2 or CO. Coke formation will limit the utility of either catalyst for dry reforming of propane in practice.
1. Introduction
The utilization of carbon dioxide as a reactant in chemical
conversions is of fundamental and practical interest. One use
of carbon dioxide is as an oxygen source or oxidant in partial
oxidation reactions of alkanes and oxidative dehydrogenation
(ODH)
of
propane,
isobutane
and
ethylbenzene.1–6
Dry
reforming of light alkanes can be used to produce synthesis
gas. Use of abundant propane is a potential feedstock for pro-
ducing synthesis gas:
C3H8 + 3CO2 →6CO + 4H2,
ΔH298K = 620 kJ mol
(1)
Synthesis gas is commercially generated by several pro-
cesses including: hydrocarbon reforming7–9 and occasional
reforming of alcohols.10–13 Gasification of coal or biomass in
limited oxygen is also utilized.14–17 Reforming of propane
with carbon dioxide (eqn (1)) has been proposed as a path-
way for synthesis gas and/or hydrogen production using
abundant propane; a major constituent of liquefied petro-
leum gas (LPG) now produced from low-cost shale gas.18,19
Reforming of hydrocarbons and alcohols primarily yields a
mixture of hydrogen, and CO, including CO2 and H2O as mi-
nor constituents. The hydrogen produced can be either sepa-
rated, or utilized with CO as synthesis gas for the down-
stream production of a number of fuels and chemicals
including methanol, ammonia, olefins, and liquid fuels.20–23
If syngas or hydrogen is desirable final products, then it is
important that to prevent further reactions of hydrogen in-
cluding methanation:
CO2 + 4H2 →4CH4 + 2H2O,
ΔH298K = −165 kJ mol
(2)
CO + 3H2 →CH4 + H2O,
ΔH298K = −206 kJ mol

Olsbye
et
al.
reported24,25 an exceptionally stable Ni/Mg(Al)O hydrotalcite
catalyst for propane dry reforming. The high activity of the
catalysts depends strongly on the Ni particle size. Mechanis-
tic studies have shown C–C bond rupture is the rate deter-
mining step.26 Investigating a bimetallic Co–Ni/Al2O3 catalyst
in both dry reforming (DR) and steam reforming (SR) of pro-
pane, it was reported that carbon deposition was the main
cause of catalyst deactivation.26,31 In the case of SR, separate
studies on the effects of preparation method and lanthanide
elements on propane SR performance of Ni–Al2O3 catalysts
were reported.32,33 By adding small amounts (2 wt%) of lan-
thanide elements (i.e., La, Ce, and Yb) significantly improves
steam reforming activity and stability. However the catalyst
deactivates faster at high reaction temperature and the activ-
ity loss was suppressed by increasing H2O/C ratio. The cata-
lyst deactivation is due to nickel sintering and coke forma-
tion. Studies of oxidative steam reforming (OSR) of propane,
Rh/Al2O3,9,19 Ce1−xNixO2 (ref. 18) and Pd/CeO2/Al2O3 (ref. 30)
were
investigated
by

groups.

gen and high H2/CO ratio by promoting water gas shift reac-
tion. Methanation and propane cracking was not observed

during the reaction. Higher yield of hydrogen observed on
supported Rh/Al2O3 catalyst. At shorter residence time higher
amounts of hydrocarbon byproducts observed, however com-
plete hydrocarbon oxidation noticed at longer residence time
producing CO2 and H2O.
There have been few reports of partial oxidation of pro-
pane with CO2 as an oxidant. Sutton et al.34 examined the ki-
netics and the mechanism of propane partial oxidation over
Ru supported on Al2O3. This catalyst mainly promotes syngas.
The ratio of CO/H2 increases with increase in temperature.
Recently, low temperature oxidation in oxygen of butane35
has been studied over Ru/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the in-
cipient wetness impregnation method using RuCl3 as a metal
precursor. It was found that in the presence of large amount
of chlorine on the catalyst surface, the catalytic activity to-
wards the C3–C4 alkanes oxidation were greatly suppressed.
Also, the pre-treatment in oxygen at different temperatures
(250 °C and 600 °C) induce significant loss of activity of the
Ru/Al2O3 catalysts in both reactions. The activity loss was at-
tributed to the formation of crystalline RuO2 oxide and to
sintering of the active phase.
We are interested in doped metal oxide catalysts and their
reactivity for propane partial oxidation using carbon dioxide
as an oxidant. Doped metal oxide catalysts may be more ac-
tive and stable compared to supported metal oxide catalysts
in some instances. In prior work we showed that ceria doped
with ruthenium is an active and stable catalyst for carbon di-
oxide methanation.37 In this paper we examine the hypothe-
sis that doping metal oxides relatively inactive metal oxides
with Ru would promote partial oxidation of propane and that
the hydrogen produced during dehydrogenation would react
with carbon dioxide to produce methane (eqn (2)) which
would be facilitated by the methanation activity of Ru doped
ceria. Ceria is redox active metal oxide which when partially
reduced contains abundant vacancies making the surface rel-
atively basic and reactive to CO2 (a Lewis acid) forming car-
bonate intermediates. Whereas, zirconia is a less reducible
oxide generally considered to be an “acidic” metal oxide and
not as reactive for acidic CO2.45–46 For both ceria and zirconia
we expect that the substitution of an Ru atom as a lower va-
lence dopant for a 4+ cation (Ce or Zr) will make both sur-
faces more reducible and more able to form surface oxygen
vacancies and reactive for CO2. The surface reaction of pro-
pane dehydrogenation can reduce the ceria producing the va-
cancies needed to create a surface with increased reactivity
for CO2. We are interested in measuring the relative reactiv-
ities of the low valence Ru dopant in the two different host
oxides. The aim of this work is to study the partial oxidation
of propane using CO2 as an oxidant and to address the fol-
lowing questions:
1) What is the activity and selectivity of 5% Ru doped CeO2
for partial oxidation of propane compare to 5% Ru doped ZrO2?
2) What is the effect of support and oxygen transfer capac-
ity on the progress of partial oxidation?
We examine the catalyst performance over a range of con-
ditions including temperature, feed ratios, and space times.
2. Experimental methods
Catalyst synthesis
5% Ru doped CeO2 and 5% Ru doped ZrO2 catalysts were
synthesized by using the combustion method in our previous
work.37 The combustion synthesis method was used for both
catalyst which has been shown to dope catalysts; our group
has studied Ru doped CeO2 and synchrotron XRD and activ-
ity studies suggest an single phase doped oxide material
using this method. In a typical preparation, 2.5 g of ceric am-
monium nitrate, 49.78 mg of RuCl3, and 1.25 g of oxalic
dihydrazide are dissolved in distilled water. Similarly, for syn-
thesis of Ru doped ZrO2, 2.5 g of zirconyl nitrate (ZrOĲNO3)2
·6H2O), 80 mg of RuCl3, and 1.39 g of oxalyldihydrazide are
dissolved in distilled water. The aqueous mixture is put into
a muffle furnace at 550 °C until combustion occurs spontane-
ously
giving
the
final
Ce0.95Ru0.05O2
and
Zr0.95Ru0.05O2
product.
Catalyst characterization
To determine whether or not a “doped” oxide was indeed cre-
ated or if the Ru created separate phases, XRD powder dif-
fraction was used (Philips XPERT MPD, Cu Kα) and the reflec-
tions between 10 and 90 degrees.
BET surface areas were measured by N2 physisorption at
−196 °C using Tristar 3000 gas absorption analyzer, Micro-
meritics. Samples were out-gased at 120 °C under a flow of
N2 for 12 h prior to analysis.
The morphology of the doped samples was characterized
by scanning electron microscopy (FEI XL30 Sirion FEG Digital
microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) im-
ages of the powder samples were recorded on a FEI Tecnai
G2 Sphera Microscope.
Oxygen storage capacity (OSC) measurements were carried
out in a plug flow reactor coupled to a mass spectrometer.
Before performing the oxygen storage capacity, the catalyst
was heated in the flow of Ar at 500 °C for an hour to remove
adsorbed water and residual water in the reactor from the
surface. Then the samples were reduced under H2 (30% H2
in Ar) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the samples were cooled to
450 °C and purged in Ar at 450 °C. O2 was injected to the cat-
alyst surface until the oxygen uptake was finished. Integra-
tion of the partial pressure as a function of time was used to
accurately determine the amounts of O2 consumed during
the O2 step pulses. The amount of oxygen consumed on the
catalysts was calculated by subtracting the unreacted O2 from
the blank O2 injected at room temperature.
The H2-TPR was performed in a plug flow reactor coupled
to a mass spectrometer. Before performing TPR, the catalyst
was pretreated at 500 °C with heating rate of 10 °C min−1,
followed by cooling in Ar flow to room temperature. Then the
H2-TPR reaction was carried out from room temperature to
550 °C. The H2 uptake was detected by mass spectrometer by
change in partial pressure of H2. The maximum amount of
hydrogen consumed correlates the maximum amount of wa-
ter produced. By integrating the partial pressure of H2O as a

function of time was used to accurately determine the
amounts of H2O produced during the H2-TPR. To quantify H2
uptake,44 the number of moles of oxygen was subtracted
from the total mole of H2O produced.
In
order
to
investigate
the
coke
after
propane
dry
reforming, the temperature was cooled to 25 °C then propane
& CO2 was switched off from the gas stream. Temperature
programmed oxidation was carried out by introducing 10%
oxygen through the catalyst bed to oxidize the carbon depos-
ited on the catalyst surface. The CO2 formed during carbon
burning was quantified by integrating the area under the
peak. Prior to CO2 quantification the mass spectrometer was
calibrated by injecting the known amount of CO2. The num-
ber of CO2 formed is converted into carbon and then calcu-
lated the carbon deposition per gram of the catalyst.
Catalyst testing
The catalysts were tested for partial oxidation of propane
using the quartz reactor with inner diameters of 3.75 mm
and length 300 mm fitted inside a stainless steel heating
block in the temperature range of 200–550 °C and at atmo-
spheric pressure. 25 mg of the catalyst used with 50 mg of
SiO2 (chromatographic grade, mesh 200) as diluents. The dil-
uent SiO2 is very inert and show no catalytic activity. Process
gases (Ar, propane and CO2) were individually connected and
controlled by mass flow controllers (MKS). The product gas
stream was sampled directly at the reactor outlet with a dif-
ferentially pumped mass spectrometer (Stanford Research
Systems RGA 200) through a controlled leak valve. For
temperature-programmed reaction (TPR) studies, the temper-
ature was ramped at the rate of 10 °C min−1 using a program-
mable temperature controller (Omega, CSC32).
3. Results and discussion
Catalyst structure
Fig. 1 shows XRD results obtained from the freshly prepared
catalysts after calcinations at 550 °C. Diffraction peaks
(Fig. 1a) for both the CeO2 and 5% Ru doped CeO2 show the
fluorite structure. The XRD data from ZrO2 and 5% Ru doped
ZrO2 showed in Fig. 1(b). Pure ZrO2 showed characteristic dif-
fraction peaks corresponding to monoclinic (m-ZrO2) and te-
tragonal (t-ZrO2) phases. The peaks at 2θ = 30 is due to tetrag-
onal structure, 2θ = 29 is monoclinic ZrO2, 2θ = 35 is
monoclinic ZrO2 and the rest of the peaks are due to mono-
clinic ZrO2. For both the doped ceria and zirconia there is no
evidence of separate Ru metal or RuO2 phases (would appear
between 25° and 42°). In our previous study43 we have char-
acterized using synchrotron-XRD (see ESI† Fig. S5) to ensure
ruthenium crystallographic phases (ruthenium metal or ox-
ides) were not forming, which strongly suggests that the
metal oxide is likely doped.
The measured BET surface area of 5% Ru doped CeO2
(14.5 m2 g−1) was approximately 50% higher than 5% Ru
doped ZrO2 (9.5 m2 g−1) as shown in Table 1. SEM images
(Fig. 2) show micron-sized crystallites for 5% Ru doped CeO2
and 5% Ru doped ZrO2. Fig. 3(a) and (b) show the typical
TEM image of 5% Ru doped CeO2 and 5% Ru doped ZrO2
samples. The 5% Ru doped CeO2 (Fig. 3(a)) sample has regu-
lar shape and about 20 nm mean diameter. 5% Ru doped
ZrO2 has irregular shape and bigger aggregates, in the order
of 100 nm (mean diameter). The characterization results indi-
cated that Ru doped CeO2 possesses small particle sizes (20
nm), high surface area (14.5 m2 g−1) compared with Ru doped
ZrO2 (100 nm and surface area, 9.5 m2 g−1) prepared by same
combustion method.
Table 2 shows the oxygen uptakes measured for the doped
and undoped catalysts. The O2 consumption obtained for 5%
Ru doped CeO2 catalyst was considerably higher than 5% Ru

doped ZrO2. Several studies reported that cerium oxide have
a very high oxygen storage capacity.38,39 This capacity is asso-
ciated to the ability of cerium to act as an oxygen buffer by
storing/releasing O2 due to the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple.39 It
has been reported that metal modified CeO2 and ZrO2 has a
higher oxygen storage capacity and reducibility than pure
CeO2 and pure ZrO2.40,41
Chemical characterization of the catalyst
The chemical properties of the Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped
ZrO2 were studied by performing temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) with H2 and CO, experiments (Table 3).
a) Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR).
Temperature programmed reductions were performed to charac-
terize the reducibility of the samples. The Fig. 4 shows the H2-
TPR reduction experiments of Ru doped CeO2 and Ru doped
ZrO2 respectively. For the H2-TPR of Ru doped CeO2, the H2 par-
tial pressure starts decreasing as the temperature reached to
100 °C, and at the same time water signal observed in the mass
spectrometer. The maximum amount of hydrogen consumed at
150 °C, and this correlates the maximum amount of water pro-
duced at the same temperature confirmed from the change in
partial pressure of H2 and H2O and the overall H2 uptake was
535 μmol g−1. After 300 °C, the H2 consumption decreases as the
catalyst surface is already reduced and it makes more difficult to
remove the oxygen from the surface. In case of Ru doped ZrO2,
the H2 uptake starts at around 200 °C and the maximum H2 re-
duction occur at much higher temperature 350 °C compare to
Ru doped CeO2 catalyst. The H2 uptake calculation shows very
low amount of H2 was consumed (137 μmol g−1), considering
ZrO2 is hardly reducible oxide (34 μmol g−1). Which indicates
that Ru doped CeO2 is much more reduced than Ru doped ZrO2
catalyst under similar conditions. In both the cases, the surface
is reduced by H2 and makes water. The presence of the Ru dop-
ant makes the CeO2 surface more reducible (Table 4).
b) Temperature-programmed reduction with CO (CO-TPR).
Temperature-programmed reduction of Ru doped CeO2 and
Ru doped ZrO2 was carried out with CO shown in Fig. 5 and 6.
For Ru doped CeO2 catalyst, CO oxidation starts at 70 °C and
the maximum oxidation occur at 90 °C. First CO2 formed
with the reduced catalyst and H2 is formed much later than
CO2 formation. However for Ru doped ZrO2 catalyst, the CO
oxidation starts at 200 °C and H2 observed at 300 °C. This
suggests that Ru doped CeO2 much more reducible than Ru
doped ZrO2. For both the catalyst, water signal remains
unchanged at all temperature when the H2 signal appears.

Therefore, we think that H2 produced from the hydroxyls
present on the catalyst surface and not from the reduction of
water (by the reduced ceria surface42 or from the water-gas
shift reaction (CO + H2O →H2 + CO2). We also noticed no H2
is produced during pretreatment of the catalyst with Ar, even
though water and hydroxyls are present on the catalyst sur-
face. Hence, we claim H2 production is attributed to the fact
that CO started reducing the surface; H2 desorbs from the re-
duced surface (Fig. 7).
Catalytic properties
Before evaluating the catalytic activity of Ru doped oxide cata-
lyst, the undoped CeO2 and undoped ZrO2 were investigated
as controls for partial oxidation of propane in the presence of

CO2 as the oxidant. Both the catalysts were inactive (<2%
C3H8 conversion) for reaction with propane up to T = 550 °C.
The activity of 5% Ru doped CeO2 and 5% Ru doped ZrO2
was investigated in the temperature range from 100 to
550 °C. The effect of temperature on propane conversion over
different catalysts is shown in Fig. 8. As the temperature in-
creases, the conversion of propane increases. In the absence
of CO2, very little propane conversion was observed for either
catalyst, and propane was not converted at all below 450 °C.
This suggests that propane is not directly oxidized by the cat-
alyst in either case despite the fact that both catalysts oxidize
hydrogen and CO. A low amount of propylene was also
detected for both the catalysts at 550 °C, despite the fact that
C–H bond dissociation can occur on ruthenium metal. Car-
bon balance calculated using the formula, moles of carbon in
products/moles of carbon in reactant, was found to be
∼100% under non-oxidative conditions for both the catalysts.
Under oxidative conditions, 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed
higher activity (53% conversion) compared to 5% Ru doped
ZrO2 (22% conversion, Fig. 8). The major products detected
were CO and H2 (Fig. 9). No propylene has been observed for
both these catalysts. 5% Ru doped CeO2 makes methane
while 5% Ru doped ZrO2 produce no methane. Propane dry
reforming on noble metal-based Pt, Rh and Ru catalysts also

studied by Solymosi et al.27–29 The dry reforming results sug-
gest that Rh and Ru catalysts are the best among other noble
catalyst for CO and H2 production which correlates with our
finding. In presence of CO2 propane makes significant
amount of H2 and CO. Instead of dehydrogenation reaction,
CO2
reforming
reaction
takes
place.
Hence
the
results
obtained from propane oxidation indicates a stronger surface
sensitivity of the propane dry reforming reaction, suggesting
that either C–C bond cleavage or C oxidation is the rate-
determining step for propane reforming. With regard to the
mechanism of the dry reforming of C3H8 over Ru/Al2O3, Ross
et al.34 assumed the fast and complete decomposition of
C3H8 to carbon and its subsequent reaction with adsorbed O
and OH formed in the dissociation of CO2. The results of the
present study, however, showed that in the absence of CO2,
the catalyst makes CO, H2 with small amount of propene only
above 450 °C. However, addition of even a small amount of
CO2 to propane opened a new route of the reaction, namely
the formation of H2 + CO (eqn (1)). This suggests that the
adsorbed oxygen originating in the dissociation of CO2 could
be involved.
CO2(a) = CO(a) + O(a)
(4)
It must be noticed that CO2 can be converted to CO via re-
verse water-gas shift reaction by consuming H2 (eqn (5)) or
via Boudouard reaction by consuming coke on the catalyst
surface (eqn (6)).
H2 + CO2 = CO + H2O
(5)
C + CO2 = 2CO
(6)
The propane reactivity studies with CO2 reveal that the ac-
tivity of the doped oxide catalysts depends upon the type of
host, propane to oxidant ratio and space time. CO2 has big-
gest role in the partial oxidation of propane. As the oxidant
(CO2) to propane ratio increases, the catalytic activity in-
creases and as well CO and H2 formation increased. Low car-
bon balance was observed for both the catalyst which is due
to coking of catalyst under reaction conditions.
The effect of the CO2/C3H8 ratio on the performance of
5% Ru doped CeO2 are shown in Fig. 10. In these runs, the
flow rate of propane is held constant and the flow rate of
CO2 and Ar are changed such that the sum of these is held
constant. Hence the total inlet flow rate is kept constant and
the space velocity is constant while the CO2/C3H8 ratio is
changed. The presence of CO2 changes the reaction pathway
of C3H8 and instead of dehydrogenation and cracking, the
formation of H2 and CO came into prominence. For a

stoichiometric composition of reacting gas mixture, C3H8/
CO2 = 1 : 3, corresponding to the eqn (7).
C3H8 + 3CO2 = 6CO + 4H2
(7)
The H2/CO ratio should be 0.66. In the experiments the reac-
tion has been carried out with different stoichiometric ratio
of CO2 to propane (CO2/C3H8= 1 to 4). The H2/CO ratio
changes depending the amount of CO2 concentration. A
much higher conversion, 87%, of C3H8 was achieved in the
presence of a large excess of CO2 (C3H8/CO2 = 1 : 4). Higher
amount of H2/CO (0.76) observed at lower CO2/C3H8 ratio
(CO2/C3H8 = 0.5) and it decreases as the CO2/C3H8 increases.
With increased CO2 content, the conversion of propane (82%
at CO2/C3H8 = 4) increased and the H2/CO ratio decreases.
Methane formation remains unchanged with increasing CO2
partial pressure. Low carbon balance (90%) observed due to
coking of catalyst. High CO2/C3H8 ratio favors CO production.
For hydrogen and/or synthesis gas production, it is apparent
that CH4 is not a desirable product as the production of CH4
competes with hydrogen generation.
CO2 methanation reaction
In our previous publication,39 5% ruthenium doped ceria was
reported to be active for CO2 methanation (eqn (2)) at relevant
temperatures and pressures. It would follow that a significant
amount of CH4 would be formed when ample amount of CO2
and H2 are present; however during propane partial oxidation
with CO2, very small amounts of CH4 are detected. This may be
explained by two reasons: (1) a more oxidizing feed rich in CO2
and (2) carbonate decomposition at higher temperatures. At
temperatures below ∼450 °C, the feed contains two moles of
carbon dioxide (oxidant) for every one mole of propane (reduc-
tant). In the prior work, one mole of carbon dioxide was fed for
every 4 moles of hydrogen (reductant), resulting in a catalyst
that was more reduced at steady state. During propane partial
oxidation, the more oxidized catalyst does not favor methane
formation, which is consistent with the prior work showing the
sensitivity of catalyst to the degree of reduction. This sensitivity
is further demonstrated when pulses of carbon dioxide and hy-
drogen are passed over a reduced ruthenium doped ceria cata-
lyst (Fig. 10). The first pulse has the most carbon monoxide,
which come from carbon dioxide reacting with the catalyst. As
the degree of reduction changes as carbon dioxide is added, the
activity changes to favor less carbon monoxide formation.
At temperatures above ∼450 °C, the conversion increases,
and more carbon monoxide (reductant) and hydrogen (reduc-
tant) are formed while carbon dioxide (oxidant) is consumed.
However, at higher temperatures, the surface carbonates re-
sponsible for methane formation have been observed to be
present in much lower concentrations on the catalyst.
It is also possible that CO could combine with hydrogen
to form methane:
CO + 3H2 →CH4 + 2H2O
(8)
Methane has been observed when only CO and H2 were ex-
posed to oxidized 5% RuCeO2; however this activity decreased
with time (Fig. 11). This is likely due to the reaction of CO with
lattice oxygen, creating CO2, which can then react with hydrogen
to form methane as described above. As the RuCeO2 is reduced,
the methane production becomes negligible. During propane
partial oxidation, the RuCeO2 is in the presence of reducing
gases, propane, propylene, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen, so
CO-methanation is expected to be negligible.

°C on 5% Ru doped CeO2 (H2 not shown). Pre-treatment: 5 hours in
10% CO at 350 °C, followed by brief heating in argon to 550 °C to
decompose any carbonates that formed. In the first pulse where the
catalyst is most reduced, the most CO2 is consumed to make CO. In
the following pulses, as the catalyst is being oxidized, less CO is made
and more methane is made.

(likely by first being oxidized by the catalyst oxygen to CO2, then to
methane) until the lattice oxygen is depleted. The catalyst had been

feed gases at time 0:00.

Effects of O2 co-feed with CO2 on propane reactivity
The data presented above for partial oxidation of propane
was using carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant. Introduction of
oxygen in the reaction mixture increases the catalyst activity
and stability.6–9 It has been observed that oxidative dehydro-
genation of light alkanes in the presence of CO2 is an endo-
thermic process (e.g. for propane ΔH298K = +166.6 kJ mol−1),
thus when small amount of oxygen is added to the system
the energy demand decreases and also the coke formation is
decreased by which the catalytic stability increases. Hence, a
second test was then carried out by adding O2 in small per-
centage in the feed, as in the proportions C3H8 : CO2 : O2 : Ar =
1 : 2 : 0.25 : 4.75 and 1 : 2 : 0.25 : 4.5. When there is no O2 in the
feed, the conversion was 55% with CO2 feed only. Noticeably,
the initial propane conversion increased up to 70% (Fig. 12)
when O2/C3H8 was 0.25. With further increase in O2 concen-
tration, propane conversion increased to 80%. The conver-
sion of O2 was almost 100% for all the duration of the run.
The formation of CO (yield = 70%) and H2 (yield = 27%) in-
creased when both CO2 + O2 mixture were used as oxidant.
To probe the question of whether or not propane is de-
hydrogenated independently to produce propylene which in
turn is reacted with the carbon dioxide, propylene reactivity
was studied on the doped metal oxide catalysts. The activity
was measured from 100 to 550 °C at temperature ramp rate
of 20 °C min−1 under oxidative condition using CO2 as oxi-
dant. Under non oxidative condition, a low conversion of
propylene (∼17% at 550 °C) was observed for both 5% Ru
doped ceria and 5% Ru doped zirconia catalysts and no sig-
nificant differences were observed between the two catalysts
(see Fig. S1 in ESI† data). The major products observed were
CO and H2. Under oxidative conditions, propylene reacts in
the presence of CO2 to form CO and H2. The ratio of H2 to
CO was ∼0.27. At high temperature, 550 °C, the higher sur-
face area 5% Ru doped CeO2 showed a higher conversion
(conversion ∼45%) compared to 5% Ru doped ZrO2 (conver-
sion ∼30%, see Fig. S2 in ESI† data).
Catalyst stability and deactivation
Fig. 13 shows the results from continuous operation of the
catalysts tests carried out for 15 h over 5% Ru doped CeO2
with a CO2/C3H8 ratio equal to 2. The catalyst showed im-
proved stability up to 1 h (conversion = 52%) then the conver-
sion decreased gradually with time on stream (after 15 h,
conversion
= 32%).
However, the
H2/CO ratio remains
unchanged (H2/CO = 0.73). When the reaction was carried
out in presence of O2 with CO2, the catalyst showed higher
activity (conversion = 62%) and better stability compared to
the reaction with CO2 only. The initial conversion was 62%
then after 3 h the conversion decreased to 52% and remains
steady up to 15 h on time on stream.
It has been observed that Ru based catalyst are active for
propane partial oxidation to syngas. However the coke forma-
tion and active metal sintering are expected to cause deactiva-
tion of Ru based catalysts. The activity decreases with time
on stream due to carbon deposition on catalyst surface.
Hence it is high priority how to regenerate the catalyst from
coking. Typically in industry, O2 or air is used to oxidize coke
in the regenerator.40 Literature suggests that the efficient cou-
pling of air oxidation (C (s) + O2 (g) →CO2 (g), ΔH = −394.5
kJ mol−1) and reverse Boudouard reaction (C (s) + CO2 (g) →
2CO (g), ΔH = 175.2 kJ mol−1), led to better regenerative oper-
ation for reducing catalyst sintering.
The carbon on the catalyst surface was oxidized by intro-
ducing oxygen to the catalyst bed. The carbon was converted
to mostly CO2 and partly CO detected by quadrupole mass
spectrometer. The carbon on the catalyst was mostly oxidized
at the temperature under 300 °C (Fig. 14). The carbon formed
in the catalyst might be carbon having small range order
which burn at lower temperature. If the carbon is long range
order (considered hard coke) then it should oxidized at

higher temperature. But in our case the carbon deposited
should be soft coke which decomposed at lower temperature.
4. Conclusions
Ceria and zirconia are relatively inactive for reactions with al-
kanes. Atomic doping with 5% Ru activates both metal oxides
for partial oxidation of propane with carbon dioxide as an ox-
idant. The present work supports the following:
1) Both host oxides were inactive to propane and carbon
dioxide when ruthenium was absent, doping with ruthenium
increases C–C cleavage and dry reforming activity of propane
at modest temperatures. Dehydrogenation to propylene was
not observed.
2) Ruthenium doped ceria has higher oxygen mobility and
was more reducible with hydrogen and carbon monoxide
than ruthenium doped zirconia. However, both catalysts were
unreactive towards propane below 300 °C and their activities
were nearly identical above 300 °C. We conclude that the re-
ducibility of the oxide had no significant effect on the cata-
lyst activity.
3) The surface morphologies of the two catalysts are very
different and the particles sizes, and surface areas are differ-
ent. RuCeOx has been reported to contain many surface car-
bonates that participate in reactions, and RuZrO2 does not
contain carbonates. Despite these differences, the activity of
the two catalysts are the same below 450 °C and comparable
above that temperature. Despite incorporation into different
host oxides, the ruthenium metal loading still has the largest
effect on propane conversion. The low rate of dehydrogena-
tion in the absence of carbon dioxide suggests that the chem-
istry is not identical to ruthenium on an inert support.
4) Co-feeding CO2 substantially increased the activity for
both catalysts and more CO was observed at high partial
pressures of CO2. Both catalysts suffered from deactivation
from coke formation. The addition of 25% O2 facilitated
greater propane conversion, lower coke, and a greater syngas
yield.
