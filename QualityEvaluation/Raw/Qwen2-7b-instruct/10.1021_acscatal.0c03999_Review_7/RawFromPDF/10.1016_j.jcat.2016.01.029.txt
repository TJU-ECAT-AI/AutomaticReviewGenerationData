The decomposition of C3H8 and its reaction with CO2 have been investigated on Au deposited on ZnO,
MgO and Al2O3. The reactions proceeded above 650–700 K. The conversion of C3H8 was only few percents
on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3, even at 873 K, but reached 17% on Au/ZnO. The selectivity of propylene for-
mation was about 56%. CO2 only slightly affected the reaction of C3H8 on Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO, but sig-
niﬁcantly enhanced the conversion of C3H8 on Au/ZnO catalyst. The formation of large amount of CO
indicates the involvement of CO2 in the reaction of C3H8. From the product distribution it was inferred
that beside the oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming reaction, the decomposition of C3H8 into
CH4 and surface carbon also occurred. The effect of ZnO is explained by an electronic interaction between
n-type ZnO and Au particles leading to a formation of reactive CO2

1. Introduction
The production of synthesis gas, H2 + CO, in the dry reforming of
CH4 is an important process for chemical technology and has been
the subject of extensive studies [1–3]. From the ﬁrst comparative
work it was found that on the basis of turnover frequency deter-
mined on noble metals, Rh and Ru are the most active catalysts
[4]. Attempts were also made to produce synthesis gas by the reac-
tions of C2H6 and C3H8 with CO2. Whereas in the absence of CO2 the
dehydrogenation of C3H8 was the major process, in the presence of
CO2 the formation of H2 + CO2 came into prominence [5–10]. As
regards the dry reforming of C3H8, Rh and Ru also exhibited the
highest speciﬁc activity [5]. Kinetic measurements revealed a
zero-order dependence in C3H8 and a fractional dependence in
CO2 [6]. Many of the above cited studies revealed that the nature
of the support plays an important role in the activity and selectiv-
ity of different catalysts. The best example is Mo2C. Whereas Mo2C/
SiO2 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of C3H8 [10], using ZSM-5 as a
support the aromatization of C3H8 became the main reaction path-
way [11]. Several studies have been also performed on the oxida-
tive dehydrogenation of propane with molecular O2 on oxide
catalysts [12–15]. V2O5 containing catalysts proved to be the most
effective and selective, particularly when C3H8 was in a great
excess [14]. A great challenge was to avoid the over oxidation of
oleﬁns formed. The inﬂuence of several additives including Au/
TiO2 was tested [14]. Au/TiO2 alone showed a low activity, but mix-
ing with V2O5, yielded H2 in larger concentration than obtained on
either vanadium or gold [14]. Au/TiO2 was also active in the selec-
tive oxidation of propane to propylene oxide [15].
In the present work the reaction of C3H8 with CO2 is examined
over supported Au nanoparticles. As was discovered by several
decades ago, Au in nanosize exhibits a surprisingly high activity
in many catalytic reactions [16–18]. Recently, we found that Au
nanoparticles supported by n-type semiconducting oxides are very
effective catalysts in the reaction of C2H6 with CO2 [19].
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Supported Au catalysts with a gold loading of 1 wt% were pre-
pared by a deposition–precipitation method. Chloroauric acid
(HAuCl4aq p.a. 49% Au, Fluka AG) was ﬁrst dissolved in triply dis-
tilled water. After the pH of the HAuCl4 aqueous solution was
adjusted to 7.5 pH by adding 25% ammonia solution, the ﬁne pow-
der of oxidic support was suspended and kept at 343 K for 1 h with
continuous stirring. The suspension was aged for 24 h at room
temperature and washed with distilled water repeatedly, dried at
353 K, calcined in air and reduced at 673 K for 4 h. Al2O3 (Degussa)
and MgO (Reanal) were applied as a support. 1% Au/ZnO (AUROlite)
sample was purchased from Strem Chem. The gases used were of
commercial purity.
2.2. Methods
For FTIR studies a mobile IR cell housed in a metal chamber was
used, which can be evacuated to 105 Torr using a turbo molecular

pumping system. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Biorad
(Digilab. Div. FTS 155) instrument with a wave number accuracy
of ±4 cm1. All the spectra presented in this study are difference
spectra. The sizes of Au particles were determined in a transmis-
sion electron microscope. BET measurements were carried out by
N2 adsorption at 77 K. Catalytic measurements were carried out
in a ﬁxed bed continuous ﬂow reactor made of a quartz tube.
The ﬂow rate of reactant gases was 12 ml/min. The exit gas was
analyzed by gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890) on a Pora-
pak QS column. The carrier gas was Ar which contained 12.5% of
C3H8. In the study of CO2 + C3H8 reaction we applied a gas mixture
of 1:1 mole ratio. The selectivity for C3H6 was calculated as fol-
lows: C3H6 selectivity = 3  nC3H6/Ri xini  100. In the temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature programmed
reduction (TPR), the heating rate was 5 K/min and the ﬂow of Ar
(TPD) and H2 (TPR) was 20 ml/min. The products desorbed or
formed were determined by gas chromatograph.
3. Results
3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
The main size of the Au particles in the Au/ZnO is small, 2–3 nm,
and uniform. This value for Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 fells in the range
of 2–10 nm. BET surface area of the catalysts used is as follows:
50 m2/g for Au/ZnO, 170 m2/g for Au/MgO and 100 m2/g for Au/
Al2O3. All catalysts have been also characterized by X-ray photo-
electron spectroscopic measurements (XPS). In the analysis of the
XPS spectra we accepted the BEs of three Au states: 84.0 eV for
Au0, 84.6 eV for Au1+ and 85.9 eV for Au3+. Binding energies
obtained fell in the range of 84.1–84.3 eV suggesting that Au is in
the form of Au0. Some characteristic data for supported Au are
shown in Table 1.
3.2. IR spectroscopic studies
The adsorption of propane on Au/ZnO catalyst was performed
around 215 K. FTIR spectra obtained are presented in Fig. 1A. Note
that the gas-phase spectrum has been subtracted from each spec-
trum. At 215 K absorption bands can be identiﬁed at 2981, 2967,
2960, 2901, 2875 cm1 in the high frequency region, and 1472,
1457, 1387, 1375 cm1 in the low frequency range. Heating the
sample to 373 K, or adsorption of propane at 373 K led to a dra-
matic attenuation of all bands occurred with slight shifts in their
position. In the low frequency region the absorption bands
emerged only at higher temperature. Absorption bands observed
at different temperatures and their possible assignments are
shown in Table 2.
3.3. TPD measurements
The interaction of propane with Au/ZnO catalysts and ZnO sup-
port was also examined by means of TPD measurements. The sam-
ple was kept in the propane ﬂow for 15 min at 300 K, and then it
was washed with pure Ar until it contained propane (15–
20 min). TPD spectra are displayed in Fig. 1C and D. No weakly
adsorbed C3H8 was detected, it desorbed very likely when washing
the catalysts with Ar before TPD measurements. From pure ZnO
the desorption of larger amount of CH4 with Tp = 773 K, and the
release of smaller amounts of C2H4 and C2H6 also above 700 K were
registered. In the case of Au/ZnO catalyst almost twice as much
CH4 desorbed also with Tp = 773 K.
3.4. Dehydrogenation of C3H8
Conversion of propane on various Au samples as a function of
reaction temperature is given in Fig. 2A. Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO
exhibited a very slight catalytic effect even at 873 K. A much higher
activity was found on Au/ZnO. The reaction started above 725–
750 K and the conversion of propane reached 17% at 873 K. The
catalyst exhibited a remarkable stability. To establish the contribu-
tion of the Au similar experiments were performed with ZnO sup-
port alone. ZnO also catalyzed the dehydrogenation reaction, but
the conversion of propane was much less, 8%, than that measured
on Au/ZnO catalyst. The major products on ZnO and Au/ZnO are H2
followed by C3H6, CH4 and C2H4. Product distributions obtained on
different catalysts are presented in Fig. 3. The selectivity for C3H6
formation on Au/ZnO is in the range of 83–90%. On the catalysts
showing a low activity the product distribution is somewhat
different.
3.5. Reaction of CO2 + C3H8
Adding CO2 to propane caused only a slight increase in the
extent of the reaction of C3H8 on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3. CO2
enhanced only moderately the extent of the reaction of propane
on pure ZnO used for the preparation of Au/ZnO: the conversion
of C3H8 reached only 13% at 873 K. A dramatic increase occurred,
however, on Au/ZnO catalyst. The reaction started even at 650 K.
The conversion of C3H8 approached 50% at 873 K (Fig. 2B). Similar
conversion values were obtained for CO2 (Fig. 2C). The product dis-
tribution also underwent a signiﬁcant change. The reaction occur-
ring between CO2 and C3H8 is indicated by the formation of
signiﬁcant amount of CO, which exceeded even that of C3H6. This
is shown in Fig. 4. Apart from the CO, CH4 became the major pro-
duct followed by H2, C3H6 and C2H4. The experiments have been
repeated by three times using always a fresh catalyst. The conver-
sion value fell in the range of 45–50% and we obtained the same
sequence of products with only a slight variation. The approximate
error bars ±3%. Note that we did not experience a decrease in the
activity of Au/ZnO at 873 K for several hours, but it drastically
declined when the reaction temperature was raised above 923 K.
The selectivity of C3H6 formation was the highest, 70–75%, at
773 K. This value became lower, 56.3%, at 873 K. However the yield
of C3H6 production considerably increased from the value of 6–7
(773 K) to a value of 25–30 (873 K). A great effort was made to
identify the formation of hexane and hexene, the products of
dimerization of C3H7 and C3H6 species. Both compounds were
detected only in trace quantities.

When the amount of CO2 is varied keeping the concentration of
C3H8 constant, the extent of reaction of C3H8 at lower CO2 content
decreased. An increase in the CO2:C3H6 ratio only slightly enhanced
the conversion of C3H8 and altered only little the product distribu-
tion. Results obtained are plotted in Fig. 5A and B. The apparent
activation energies for the formation of different products have
been determined on Au/ZnO in the temperature range of 763–
823 K. Some Arrhenius plots are displayed in Fig. 5C. We obtained
the following values: 105.5 kJ/mol for C3H6: 129.6 kJ/mol for CO:
161.3 kJ/mol for H2 and 186.7 kJ/mol for CH4.
The amounts of carbon-containing deposit formed in the
CO2 + C3H8 reaction on Au/ZnO catalyst and its reactivity have
been
determined
by
TPR
measurements.
The
formation
of
methane, ethylene and ethane was established. Methane peak
was found at Tp = 874 K, but its continuous evolution was experi-
enced even above this temperature. The formation of C2H6
occurred in two peaks with Tp values of 841 and 1039 K, while
that of C2H4 with Tp  872 K and 1118 K. TPR spectra are dis-
played in Fig. 6.
One of the referees noted that the carbon mass balance is very
important,
particularly
when
the
conversion
exceeds
70%.
Although the conversion in our case was always below 50%, we cal-
culated the carbon balance for all measurements performed on Au/
ZnO. About 6–11% of C was missing in average, which was

attributed to the low reactivity of the carbon deposit formed in the
reaction at 873 K.
3.6. Reactions of propylene
In order to ﬁnd out the fate of propylene formed in the decom-
position propane, its reaction with CO2 was also examined on Au/
ZnO. Propylene underwent relatively little decomposition over this
catalyst. The conversion reached only 4.5% at 873 K. The main pro-
duct was H2. Less amount of CH4 was also detected. Adding CO2 to
C3H6 increased the conversion with few percents and led to the for-
mation of CO. An enhanced formation of CH4 also occurred, which
exceeded that of H2. Raising the temperature above 823 K caused a
decline of the conversion of C3H6.
4. Discussion
4.1. IR spectroscopic studies
The interaction of propane with supported Rh [8], Re [9] and
Mo2C [10] catalysts has been investigated before by means of FTIR
spectroscopy. Adsorption of propane on Au/ZnO at 200–215 K
caused the appearance of intense absorption bands at 2981,
2967, 2960, 2901, 2875 cm1 in the CH stretching region and
1472, 1457, 1387, 1375 cm1 in the low frequency range. The spec-
trum shows a good agreement with those obtained on other cata-
lysts at low temperature [20–25]. These absorption bands are
characteristic for molecularly adsorbed propane, and their assign-
ments are presented in Table 2. Although the catalytic reactions
of propane proceed at high temperatures (Figs. 2 and 3) changes
in the IR spectra indicate the occurrence of a surface interaction
at or above room temperature. As in the previously studied cata-
lysts, the formation of p-bonded propylene, di-r-bonded propy-
lene and propylidene is postulated (Table 2). These adsorbed
species appear to be strongly bonded to the catalysts surface, as
no change was experienced in the IR spectra even at high
temperatures.
TPD measurements showed that a fraction of strongly adsorbed
C3H8 remained on both the ZnO and Au/ZnO. It decomposed only
above 700 K resulting in the formation of CH4, C2H6 and C2H4.

is strongly endothermic and also equilibrium limited. Higher con-
version will require either higher temperature or lower pressures.
In the case where the feed gas is only propane, the equilibrium pro-
pane conversion is given by the formula Kp = Px2/(1  x2) with Kp
the equilibrium constant, x the equilibrium conversion and P the
total pressure.
From the supported Au catalysts examined only the Au/ZnO
exhibited a moderate catalytic effect for the dehydrogenation of
propane Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3 were found almost inactive below
873 K. The conversion on Au/ZnO reached a value of 17–18% even
at 823 K. We notice that the conversion of the propane never
matched with the chemical equilibrium at any temperatures. The
amount of H2 is more than 2 times larger than that of C3H6. Note
that we did not experience such a behavior in the case of pure
ZnO up to 823 K, when the H2/C3H6 ratio was 1.0–1.3. This indi-
cates that Au nanoparticles are responsible for the large deviation
in the amount of H2 and C3H6. In the explanation of this feature we
assume that a signiﬁcant fraction of C3H8 underwent a complete
decomposition to carbon
C3H8 ¼ CH4 þ 2H2 þ 2CðsÞ
ð2Þ
and the C3H6 formed in the primarily process (Eq. (1)) also decom-
posed further
2C3H6 ¼ 2CH4 þ C2H4 þ 2CðsÞ
ð3Þ
The fact that we found CH4 and C2H4 in the products supports the
occurrence of these reactions.
The situation is different when CO2 was added to C3H8. While
CO2 only slightly increased the conversion of C3H8 on pure ZnO
(see Fig. 2), it exerted a drastic enhancement in the conversion of
C3H8 on Au/ZnO. The amounts of all products found in the dehy-
drogenation of C3H6 considerably increased. The fact that a large
amount of CO formed clearly indicates the involvement of the
CO2 in the reaction of propane. In light of the formation of products
we can account with the dry reforming of propane
C3H8 þ 3CO2 ¼ 4H2 þ 6CO
ð4Þ
and with the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
C3H8 þ CO2 ¼ C3H6 þ CO þ H2O
ð5Þ
An interesting feature of the CO2 + C3H8 reaction is the produc-
tion of a large amount of CH4, which was one order of magnitude
higher than in the absence of CO2. We may assume the occurrence
of the extended hydrogenolysis of propane in the presence of a
large amount of H2
H2 þ C3H8 ¼ CH4 þ C2H6
ð6Þ
However, C2H6 was not detected even in traces, which excludes
this route of methane formation. In addition this route of CH4 pro-
duction does not need the presence of CO2. A possible explanation
of the extended formation of CH4 is the hydrogenation of CO2
4H2 þ CO2 ¼ CH4 þ 2H2O
ð7Þ
Supported Au samples, however, were found to be completely
inactive for the above reaction below 500 K [26]. Control measure-
ment performed on the same Au/ZnO catalyst used in the present
study revealed that H2 does react with CO2 at 723–773 K resulting

only in CO and H2O. Methane was detected only in a very small
quantity. Similarly, we found no methane formation in the hydro-
genation of CO on the same catalyst. Accordingly, we may assume
that CH4 is formed in the decomposition of C3H5 radical (see below,
Eq. (11)).
In the explanation of much greater activity of Au/ZnO compared
to Au/Al2O3 and Au/MgO we should take into account that ZnO is
an n-type semiconductor, while Al2O3 and MgO are insulating oxi-
des. Based on the work function of ZnO (3.95–4.25 eV) and Au
(5.3 eV), we expect an electronic interaction between Au and
ZnO, e.g. an electron transfer from ZnO to Au particles at the Au/
ZnO interface [27]. This may result in the activation of rather inert
CO2 on Au particles in the form of negatively charged CO2
. It has
been demonstrated in several studies that negatively charged
CO2 is much more reactive than the neutral one [28,29]. Recently,
it was reported that n-type oxidic supports for Au are much more
efﬁcient in the reaction between CO2 and C2H6 compared to Au
samples deposited on insulating oxides [19].
In light of this consideration we describe the CO2 + C3H8 reac-
tions with following elementary steps. We assume that the par-
tially negatively charged CO2 enters reaction with the stable
hydrocarbons, C3H8 and C3H6, producing more reactive CxHy
fragments
C3H8 þ COd
2 ¼ C3H7ðaÞ þ CO þ OHd

C3H7ðaÞ ¼ C3H6ðaÞ þ HðaÞ
ð9Þ
C3H6ðaÞ þ COd

ð11Þ
2OHd ¼ H2O þ O2
ð12Þ
2HðaÞ ¼ H2ðgÞ
ð13Þ
Accordingly CH4 can be formed in the decomposition of C3H7
radical (Eq. (11)).
In the study of the reactions of CxHy fragments over metal single
crystals in UHV it was found that a fraction of CxHy species is
dimerized beside their decomposition [30–33]. In the case of
C3H7 hexane (C6H14) and hexene (C6H12) were identiﬁed. This pro-
cess was more expressed on less reactive Au(111) [30,31] com-
pared to Rh(111) [32] and Mo2C/Mo(100) [33] surfaces. In the
present study we found no sign of the formation of these com-
pounds. The possible reason is that the reaction of propane
occurred at very high temperature, above 650 K, when the favorite
route of the C3H7 and C3H5 is their decomposition.
We may compare the catalytic performance of supported Au in
the CO2 + C3H8 reaction with other catalysts examined under
exactly the same experimental conditions. A general feature is that
CO2 markedly accelerated the reaction of C3H8 on all catalysts.
Over Al2O3-supported Pt metals the dehydrogenation of propane
occurred at 823–923 K with selectivities of 40–55% [5]. The activity
of the catalysts depended on the nature of the metal: on the most
effective Rh/Al2O3, the conversion reached a value of 63.5%, and on
the less effective Pd/Al2O3 this value was only 4.3%. These catalysts
were found to be effective for the dry-reforming of propane to pro-
duce synthesis gas at 823–923 K [5]. Over Re/Al2O3 the decompo-
sition of C3H8 sets in at 873–923 K with selectivity to propylene
of 43–74% [9]. Adding CO2 to C3H8 changed the reaction pathway
of C3H8, and the dry reforming of C3H8 came into prominence.
Mo2C deposited on SiO2 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of C3H8
at 773–873 K [10]. The selectivity of propylene formation attained
a value of 35–50% at a conversion of 25–35%.
5. Conclusions
(i) Propane interacts with Au/ZnO even below 300 K yielding
adsorbed propylene and propylidene.
(ii) Dehydrogenation of C3H8 and its reaction with CO2 are lim-
ited on Au/MgO and Au/Al2O3.
(iii) In contrast, Az/ZnO exhibited a much higher activity in the
dehydrogenation of propane. Adding CO2 to propane further
increased the conversion.
(iv) The catalytic performance of Au/ZnO was explained by the
occurrence of an electronic interaction between Au and n-
type ZnO leading to the activation of CO2.
