Abstract
Cr-MCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) has been characterized by X-ray dif-
fraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis, X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS), and UV-Raman spectroscopic
measurements. It is suggested that monochromate species mainly exist on the Cr-MCM-41 by the DHT method while several types of chro-
mate species including both monochromates and polychromates coexist on that by the TIE method. The two kinds of samples exhibit similar
catalytic property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide. The selectivity to propylene is higher than 90% and the presence
of carbon dioxide enhances propane conversion. The chromate species on both types of samples are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) with
octahedral coordination during the dehydrogenation reactions. On the other hand, the selectivity to formaldehyde in the partial oxidation of
methane with oxygen is remarkably higher over the sample by the DHT method than that by the TIE method. The structure of the chromate
species is kept during the oxidation of methane, and the high dispersion of monochromate species probably accounts for the higher selectivity
over the sample by the DHT method.

1. Introduction
Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention
because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2].
Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were in-
dustrially used for the production of polyethylene (Phillips
catalyst) [3,4] and lower alkenes such as propylene and
isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the correspond-
ing alkanes [5,6], respectively. Carbon dioxide was found to
enhance the dehydrogenation of propane [7] or ethane [8,9]
over silica-supported chromium oxide. Supported chromium
oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehy-
drogenation of lower alkanes [10–13] or oxidation of other
organic compounds with oxygen [14,15]. The redox prop-
erty and the appropriate dispersion of chromium species on
the support are important in these catalytic reactions [13].

Studies of chromium species introduced into MCM-41, a
typical mesoporous molecular sieve, would thus be useful
in developing Cr-containing catalysts with desirable cat-
alytic properties. There exist several studies on the syntheses
and characterizations of Cr-MCM-41 [16–21]. For catalytic
reactions, Cr-MCM-41 has been used for the liquid-phase
oxidation with alkyl hydroperoxide [21] or hydrogen per-
oxide [22], but the leaching of chromium to the liquid
phase seems a big problem for the Cr-containing micro-
porous and mesoporous materials [23–25]. Cr-containing
mesoporous molecular sieves (Cr-HMS) were reported to
exhibit high photocatalytic reactivity in ethylene polymer-
ization [26]. Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation
method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of
propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was
low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield
to propylene was lower than 5% [20]. Recently, a SBA-
15-supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method
has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative

dehydrogenation of propane and showed good catalytic per-
formance [27].
The oxidation state of chromium and the coordination
structure of chromium species over supported chromium ox-
ides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been inves-
tigated by various techniques such as ESR [28], UV–vis
diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy [29], XPS [30], XANES
[21,31], and TPR [32]. Several types of chromium species,
e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chrom-
ium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples.
It can be expected that different synthetic methods
would result in different chromium species and the different
chromium species may behave differently in catalytic reac-
tions. Although there are many studies on the correlation
between catalytic properties and coordination structures of
the supported chromium oxides [33], such structure-property
relationships are still needed to elucidate the Cr-containing
mesoporous molecular sieve systems in different types of
reactions. Recently, we applied two different methods, i.e.,
direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion ex-
change (TIE), to the syntheses of V- [34], Fe- [35], and
Mn-MCM-41 [36]. The two methods resulted in different
locations and coordination environments of the incorporated
metal cations; the TIE method provided highly dispersed
metal ions on the wall surface of MCM-41 inside the meso-
pores and the DHT method had the tendency to incorporate
metal ions inside the framework of MCM-41. It has been
clariﬁed that the two different methods for introducing metal
ions bring about remarkably different catalytic behaviors in
selective oxidation reactions.
In the present paper, we report the synthesis of Cr-MCM-
41 using the TIE and the DHT methods. The synthesized
materials are characterized in detail to gain information
about the structures of the introduced chromium species.
Two kinds of catalytic reactions, viz., the dehydrogenation
of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of
methane with oxygen are investigated and compared to elu-
cidate the structure-property relationships for the two types
of Cr-MCM-41.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Chromium was introduced into MCM-41 by following
two different methods. The Cr-MCM-41-DHT was prepared
by direct hydrothermal synthesis. Chromium nitrate, sodium
silicate, and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide were
used as the sources of chromium, silicon, and the template,
respectively. The molar ratio of the template to the silicon
source was kept at 0.5 in the synthesis gel for each syn-
thesis. The synthesis gel was stirred for 1 h at room tem-
perature and was then transferred to a Teﬂon bottle, which
was placed in a stainless-steel autoclave after the adjustment
of the pH value of the mixed gel to 10.5 with 4 M HCl.
The hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 150 ◦C for
48 h, and then the resultant solid was recovered by ﬁltra-
tion, washed with deionized water thoroughly, and dried at
40 ◦C in vacuum for ca. 24 h. After calcination at 550 ◦C
for 6 h in a ﬂow of dry air, the Cr-MCM-41-DHT was ob-
tained. The Cr-MCM-41-TIE was synthesized by the tem-
plate ion-exchange method. It is known that the cationic
surfactants in the as-synthesized MCM-41 after hydrother-
mal synthesis are mainly organized in the form of a cylin-
drical micellar structure with hydrophilic positive ends in-
teracting with silica pore surfaces via Coulombic interac-
tion, and can be replaced through the ion-exchange by other
cations such as VO2+ [34,37], Fe3+ [35,38], Mn2+ [36,
39,40], Ti [40], [Co(en)2Cl2]+ [41], and other positively
charged complexes. In our experiments, typically the as-
synthesized MCM-41 (2 g) containing ca. 50 wt% template
was added to an ethanolic solution of chromium nitrate and
stirred vigorously at 60 ◦C for 6 h for ion exchanging be-
tween the cationic template and the Cr3+ ion. After the ion
exchange, the as-synthesized Cr-MCM-41-TIE was recov-
ered by ﬁltration, washing thoroughly with deionized water,
and drying at 40 ◦C in vacuum. The remained organic tem-
plate was removed by calcination at 550 ◦C for 6 h to gain
the Cr-MCM-41-TIE sample.
2.2. Characterizations
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spec-
trometry was used for the determination of the chromium
content in each sample synthesized above. The measure-
ments were performed with a Perkin-Elmer OPTIMA 3000,
and the sample was dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO3
acids before the measurement.
N2-adsorption studies were used to examine the porous
properties of each sample. The measurements were carried
out on Belsorp 18SP equipment (volumetric), and all the
samples were pretreated in vacuum at 200 ◦C for 12 h before
the measurement. The pore-size distribution was evaluated
from the adsorption isotherm by the Dollimore and Heal
(DH) method [42].
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a
SRA M18XHF diffractometer (MAC Science Co., Ltd.,
Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, 300 mA). Small diver-
gent and scattering slits (0.05 mm) were selected to avoid a
high background at low diffraction angles.
Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra were recorded on a
Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer. The
powdery sample was loaded into a quartz cell, and the spec-
tra were collected at 200–700 nm referenced to BaSO4.
X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were per-
formed with synchrotron radiation at a beam line BL7C
station of the photon factory, at the High Energy Acceler-
ator Research Organization (Tsukuba, Japan), operated at
2.5 GeV with about 350–380 mA of ring current. The data
were recorded in X-ray ﬂuorescence mode at room tempera-
ture using a Si(111) double crystal monochromator. Energy

was calibrated with CuK-edge absorption (8981.0 eV), and
the energy step of measurement in the XANES region was
0.3 eV. The absorption was normalized to 1.0 at an energy
position of 30 eV higher than the absorption edge.
UV-Raman spectroscopic measurements were carried out
with a Renishaw UV–vis Raman System 1000R using the
UV line at 325 nm from a Kimmon IK 3201R-F He-Cd laser
as the exciting source. The sample was loaded in an in situ
cell and was treated in pure N2 gas ﬂow at 200 ◦C for de-
hydration before the measurement. A laser output of 30 mW
was used and the maximum incident power at the sample
was approximately 6 mW.
2.3. Catalytic properties
The dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 and the partial
oxidation of CH4 with O2 were investigated, respectively,
to study the catalytic properties of the materials synthesized
above. Both kinds of reactions were carried out using a ﬁxed-
bed ﬂow reactor (U-type quartz tube with inner diameter of
4 mm) operated at atmospheric pressure.
In the dehydrogenation reactions, typically 0.4 g of sam-
ple, which had been pelletized and sieved to 250–417 µm,
was loaded into the reactor and treated in a gas ﬂow contain-
ing N2 (10 ml min−1) and O2 (10 ml min−1) at 550 ◦C for 1 h
and then purged with He (purity, 99.99%). The reaction was
started by introducing a gas mixture of CO2, C3H8, He, and
N2 to the reactor. N2 was used as the internal standard for
the calculations of the conversions of CO2 and C3H8, while
He was used for dilution to control the partial pressures of
the reactants.
For partial oxidation of CH4, typically 0.05 g of sample
was used. After pretreatment at 550 ◦C in a ﬂow of mix-
ture of He (50 ml min−1) and O2 (10 ml min−1) for 1 h,
the reactants of CH4 and O2 diluted with He were fed to
the reactor to start the reaction. The products in each reac-
tion were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography. All the
lines and valves between the exit of the reactor and the gas
chromatographs were heated to 120 ◦C to prevent the con-
densation of the partial oxidation products.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Porous properties of materials
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns at low diffraction angles
for the calcined Cr-MCM-41 samples with Si/Cr atomic
ratios of 100 and 50 prepared by both the DHT and the
TIE methods. Four diffraction lines at 2θ degrees of 2–6◦
indexed to (100), (110), (200), and (210) of the regular-
ity of hexagonal array of mesopores of MCM-41 were ob-
served for all these samples. The peak intensities for the
Cr-containing MCM-41 samples were not signiﬁcantly low-
ered as compared with those for the purely silicious MCM-
41, suggesting that the long-range regularity of hexagonal

arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the in-
troduction of chromium up to a content of 1.7 wt% (Si/Cr =
50) by both methods. However, as Si/Cr ratio decreased to
25, in other words, as the chromium content increased to
3.4 wt%, these diffraction peaks decreased largely for the
samples prepared by both methods, indicating a decrease
in the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure at
higher chromium content. XRD results at high diffraction
angles for the calcined Cr-MCM-41 samples with a Si/Cr
ratio of 25 are shown in Fig. 2. Only a broad peak due to
amorphous feature of the framework of MCM-41 appeared.
Any peak assignable to the crystalline Cr2O3 phase was
not observed for the Cr-MCM-41 samples prepared by both
methods.
The porous properties obtained from N2 adsorption at
77 K are shown in Table 1. For both series of materials, the
surface area and pore volume gradually decreased with an
increase in chromium content up to 1.7 wt% (Si/Cr = 50),
and became remarkably low as the chromium content was
increased to 3.4 wt% (Si/Cr = 25). The drop in the surface
area and the pore volume at such high chromium content was
consistent with the decrease in structural regularity observed
by XRD. No signiﬁcant difference between the TIE and the
DHT samples was observed.

K2Cr2O7, and CrO3 are all in tetrahedral coordination
whereas those in Cr2O3 are octahedrally coordinated with
oxygen. The preedge peak at ca. 5991 eV is attributed to
the so-called 1s–3d dipole forbidden transition, and this for-
bidden transition principally gains additional intensity when
the chromium center is in a noncentral symmetric environ-
ment or through mixing of 3d and 4p orbitals caused by the
breakdown of inversion symmetry due to structure distor-
tion. Since the local symmetry around the metal center is
lowered from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination, the in-
tensity of the preedge peak tends to increase simultaneously,
i.e., Ioctahedral < Isquare pyramidal < Itetrahedral [43]. Fig. 3A
clearly shows that the compounds with tetrahedrally coor-
dinated chromium exhibit remarkably higher intensity of the
preedge peak. Fig. 3A also reveals that the edge position
shifts with the change in oxidation state; the edge position
for Cr2O3 with Cr(III) is at 5997.6 eV, while those for CrO3,
K2Cr2O7, and Na2CrO4 with Cr(VI) shift to 6006.0, 6006.3,
and 6004.6 eV. The XANES results for these reference com-

pounds shown here are very similar to those reported by
Haller and co-workers [31].
Fig. 3B shows the CrK-edge XANES spectra of the Cr-
MCM-41 samples by both the DHT and the TIE methods.
No signiﬁcant difference between the samples by the DHT
and the TIE methods could be seen from the XANES re-
sults. The comparison of these spectra with those for the
references suggests that the chromium on each Cr-MCM-41
sample exists as the chromate species with Cr(VI) in tetra-
hedral coordination.
3.2.2. EXAFS results
Fig. 4 shows the Fourier transforms of k3-weighted CrK-
edge EXAFS spectra of the reference compounds. Three
main peaks at 1.62, 2.58, and 3.29 Å (non-phase-shift cor-
rected) were observed for Cr2O3, and these three peaks
corresponded to the bonds of Cr–O in CrO6 octahedra, Cr–
O–Cr through edge-shared CrO6 octahedra, and Cr–O–Cr
through corner-shared CrO6 octahedra, respectively [44].

compounds. (a) Cr2O3, (b) CrO3, (c) K2Cr2O7, (d) Na2CrO4.
For CrO3, K2Cr2O7, and NaCrO4 with Cr(VI) in CrO4 tetra-
hedra, the main peak for the Cr–O bond was observed at
1.20–1.35 Å (non-phase-shift corrected), coinciding with
the shortened bond distance of Cr–O in CrO4 tetrahedron.
The intensity of the EXAFS oscillation for CrO3 was quite
weaker than those for Na2CrO4, K2Cr2O7, and Cr2O3 (not
shown), suggesting the disorder of the CrO4 tetrahedron in
CrO3. The signiﬁcantly low intensity of the peak of Cr–O
bond for CrO3 as shown in Fig. 4 (curve b) was proba-
bly due to such disorder. The Cr–O–Cr bond could not be
clearly seen in the spectra of these three compounds with
tetrahedrally coordinated chromium although the Cr–O–Cr
linkage is actually contained in K2Cr2O7 and CrO3. We
attempted to analyze the second-shell neighbors, but the
analysis of the Cr–O–Cr shells was not successful. In other
words, our EXAFS measurements are not sensitive enough
to clarify whether the Cr–O–Cr linkages exist in the chro-
mate species.
The Fourier transforms of k3-weighted CrK-edge EX-
AFS spectra of the Cr-MCM-41 samples by both the DHT
and the TIE methods are shown in Fig. 5. Similar to the
XANES results, no signiﬁcant difference could be seen be-
tween the two types of samples by different methods. The
peak of the Cr–O bond was observed at 1.23 Å (non-phase-
shift corrected), suggesting that chromium atoms were in
tetrahedral coordination.
The EXAFS parameters of the Cr–O shell are summa-
rized in Table 2. Table 2 conﬁrms the tetrahedral coordi-
nation of chromium (total coordination number = 3.9) for
both types of samples after calcination. However, the four
Cr–O bonds of the CrO4 tetrahedron are not equivalent;
two of the Cr–O bonds are shorter (1.66–1.67 Å) and the

3.2.3. Diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis results
Fig. 6 shows the diffuse reﬂectance UV–vis spectra of
the calcined Cr-MCM-41 synthesized by both methods. UV
bands at 280 and 370 nm were mainly observed for both
kinds of samples. These bands could be assigned to the O–
Cr(VI) charge transfer of the chromate species [2]. The dif-
ference between the DHT and the TIE samples was not dis-
tinct, although it seems that a weak shoulder around 440 nm,
characteristic of Cr(VI) polychromate, appeared for the TIE
samples. The appearance of such a weak shoulder may in-
dicate the existence of polychromate in the samples synthe-
sized by the TIE method, but the large band at 370 nm may
overlap the shoulder at 440 nm in the case of DHT sam-
ples.
3.2.4. UV-Raman results
Kevan and co-workers [19] once reported the Raman
spectrum of a Cr-MCM-41 with a Si/Cr ratio of 40 prepared
by the DHT method using a laser line at 458 nm as the excit-
ing source (Vis-Raman). A band at 986 cm−1 was detected,
but the band was rather broad and the ratio of signal to noise
was not so satisfactory. We have recorded Raman spectra of
our Cr-MCM-41 samples with excitation at 514 nm, but any
useful information could not be obtained because of the se-
rious ﬂuorescence.
It has been clariﬁed that the use of a UV line as excit-
ing source of Raman spectroscopy (UV-Raman) can avoid
the ﬂuorescence interference from molecular sieves or re-
lated materials [45]. Furthermore, the use of UV excitation
may lead to a remarkable increase in the intensity of Ra-
man bands if the resonance occurs, and the UV-resonance
Raman spectroscopy has been used to identify the loca-
tions of titanium [46,47] and vanadium [48,49] in micro-

porous and mesoporous molecular sieves. In the case of
Cr-MCM-41, as shown in Fig. 6, the charge transfer of the
dπ–pπ transition between chromium and oxygen of chro-
mate species occurred from 250 to 500 nm with peaks at 280
and 370 nm. The use of a UV laser of 325 nm as the excit-
ing source in our measurements may cause the resonance.
To keep the samples dehydrated, the measurements were
performed at 200 ◦C in pure N2 gas ﬂow. Fig. 7 shows the
UV-Raman spectra of the samples prepared by both the DHT
and the TIE methods. No serious interference of the ﬂuores-
cence was observed in this case. The samples prepared by
different methods exhibited remarkable differences in UV-
Raman spectra. An intense and sharp band at 980 cm−1 was
observed for the Cr-MCM-41 samples synthesized by the
DHT method, whereas a set of multibands around 1000–
1100 cm−1 appeared in addition to that at 980 cm−1 for the
samples by the TIE method. Weckhuysen and co-workers [2]
have reviewed the Raman spectra of a number of sup-
ported chromium oxides and suggested that the band at
980–990 cm−1 could be assigned to the Cr–O stretching of
dehydrated monochromate species (CrO42−), while those at
1000–1100 cm−1 can be ascribed to the Cr–O stretching of
dehydrated polychromates. Thus, Fig. 7 strongly suggests
that the monochromate mainly exists on the samples syn-
thesized by the DHT method, whereas the samples by the
TIE method contain several types of chromate species on
the wall surface of MCM-41. For polymolybdates, it is re-
ported that the frequency of the band of Mo=O increases

as the degree of polymerization increases [50]. Although
the structure of polychromates (tetrahedral coordination of
Cr) is different from that of polymolybdates (octahedral co-
ordination of Mo), it is reasonable that the frequency of
the Cr–O stretching of polychromate also increases with
the degree of polymerization. We thus tentatively propose
that the multibands observed at 1000–1100 cm−1 corre-
spond to the dehydrated polychromates with different de-
grees of polymerization, e.g., dichromate, trichromate, and
tetrachromate. It is worth noting that the chromium in ei-
ther monochromate or polychromate is tetrahedrally coor-
dinated with oxygen. For Cr2O3, in which chromium is in
octahedral coordination and the CrO6 octahedra are linked
with each other, no band at 900–1200 cm−1 has been ob-
served as shown in Fig. 7 (curve f). Therefore, UV-Raman
spectroscopy is a potent tool in distinguishing the chromate
species with different degrees of polymerization on the wall
surface of MCM-41.
3.3. Catalytic properties of Cr-MCM-41
Fig. 8 shows the catalytic properties of Cr-MCM-41 sam-
ples synthesized by both methods in the dehydrogenation of
C3H8 with CO2 at 823 K. The two types of catalysts showed
very similar catalytic behaviors. The conversion of C3H8
increased almost linearly with an increase in chromium con-
tent in both cases, strongly suggesting that chromium is the
active site for the reaction. Although the BET surface area

and pore volume decreased largely as the chromium content
increased to 3.4 wt% (Si/Cr = 25, Table 1), the conversion
of C3H8 and the yield to C3H6 still increased with chromium
content, indicating that such change in the porous properties
did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the catalytic behavior in de-
hydrogenation of C3H8. The selectivity to C3H6 was kept
at 92–95%, and the yield of C3H6 was ca. 26% over the
sample with a chromium content of 3.4 wt% prepared by ei-
ther method. The result obtained here is remarkably higher
than those reported over the chromium oxides supported on
Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2 [7], where similar reaction
conditions were employed.
In order to clarify the contribution of CO2 to the reaction,
the effect of the partial pressure of CO2 has been investi-
gated over the DHT and the TIE samples with a Si/Cr ratio
of 50 (Cr content of 1.7 wt%) and the results are shown
in Fig. 9. Similar proﬁles were obtained for both types of
catalysts. Although the dehydrogenation of C3H8 also oc-
curred in the absence of CO2, the conversion of C3H8 in-
creased remarkably with an increase of the partial pressure
of CO2. The presence of CO2 also slightly increased the
selectivity to C3H6. Two possibilities have been proposed
for explaining the enhancing effect of CO2 on the dehy-
drogenation of lower alkanes such as C2H6 and C3H8 over
several catalysts. The presence of CO2 was found to reduce
the carbon deposition and to assist in the rapid desorption
of C2H4 from the catalyst surface in the dehydrogenation of
C2H6 over a Ga2O3/TiO2 [51]. One of the present authors

identiﬁed that CO2 could act as oxidant for the coupling
of CH4 to C2 hydrocarbons over a variety of binary ox-
ides [52–54]. It has recently been reported that CO2 may
provide oxygen species for the dehydrogenation of C2H6
over a supported Cr2O3 [55] and C3H8 over a NiMoO4
catalyst [56]. We speculate that these two roles of CO2,
i.e., the reduction of carbon deposition and the donation of
oxygen species, may both account for the enhancement of
dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 over the current cata-
lysts.
Table 3 compares the catalytic properties of the Cr-
MCM-41 synthesized by the two methods in the partial
oxidation of CH4 at 723 and 773 K with oxygen. HCHO,
the partial oxidation product, was formed along with CO
and CO2 over each sample. The conversion of CH4 in-
creased remarkably with rising reaction temperatures, but
the selectivity to HCHO decreased largely at the same time.
The increase in chromium content also increased the con-
version of CH4 and decreased the selectivity to HCHO
over both types of catalysts. The comparison of the DHT
sample with the TIE one containing the same chromium
content shows that the former type of catalyst exhibits re-
markably higher selectivity to HCHO and higher conver-
sion of CH4 under the same reaction conditions. Although
the highest rate of HCHO formation over the Cr-MCM-
41-DHT (ca. 7 mmolg−1 h−1 at 773 K, Si/Cr = 50) was
lower than that over a MCM-41-supported vanadium ox-
ide (ca. 35 mmol g−1 h−1 at 868 K) [57], the Cr-MCM-
41-DHT catalyst could operate at lower temperatures. Fur-
thermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
example that HCHO could be produced with signiﬁcant
amounts on the supported chromium catalyst. The previous
study found that the oxidation of CH4 over the supported
chromium oxide such as CrOx/SiO2 resulted in complete
combustion of CH4, although the CrOx/SiO2 showed the
highest conversion of CH4 among CrOx/SiO2, VOx/SiO2,
and MoOx/SiO2 [2].

3.4. Characterization of Cr-MCM-41 after catalytic
reactions
XRD measurements for the Cr-MCM-41 samples after
both reactions revealed that the mesoporous structure did not
undergo signiﬁcant change.
In order to gain insight into the change of the coordination
structure of chromium, the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with a
Si/Cr ratio of 50 was characterized after the dehydrogena-
tion of C3H8 in the presence of CO2. Figs. 10 and 11 show
the XANES patterns and the Fourier transforms of EXAFS
after calcination, the pretreatment in He ﬂow at 823 K, and
the reaction under the conditions shown in Fig. 8 for 5 h. Af-
ter pretreatment with He for 1 h at 823 K, the curves in both

ﬁgures did not undergo signiﬁcant change. However, the
XANES pattern and the EXAFS curve changed signiﬁcantly
after the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2.
Fig. 10 shows that, after reaction, the XANES preedge peak
became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower en-
ergy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from
Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination to Cr(III) in octahedral
coordination. For the EXAFS result (Fig. 11), two distinct
peaks were observed at 1.60 and 2.63 Å (non-phase-shift
corrected) after the reaction. Similar peaks were also ob-
served for Cr2O3 (curve a in Fig. 4), and as described above
these two peaks could be assigned to the bonds of Cr–O in
CrO6 octahedra and Cr–O–Cr through edge-shared CrO6 oc-
tahedra. However, the peak at ca. 3.29 Å (non-phase-shift
corrected) for Cr2O3 was not observable for the sample af-
ter the reaction, and the peak at 2.63 Å (non-phase-shift
corrected) was relatively weaker as compared with that for
Cr2O3. Thus, it is reasonable to consider that the chromium
species exist as small CrIIIOx clusters after the dehydrogena-
tion reaction, although it is difﬁcult to determine the size of
these clusters [58]. The curve-ﬁtting results for Cr–O shell
shown in Table 2 conﬁrmed that the coordination structure
of chromium was changed from tetrahedral to octahedral af-
ter 5 h of reaction of C3H8 dehydrogenation in the presence
of CO2. Further studies revealed that the transformation of
tetrahedral Cr(VI) to octahedral Cr(III) occurred even after
the reaction for 0.5 h. Moreover, the Cr(VI) species could
not be recovered by ﬂowing pure CO2 at 823 K. In other
words, the reoxidation of the reduced Cr(III) could not pro-
ceed with CO2. Similar results were also obtained for the
Cr-MCM-41-TIE sample with a Si/Cr ratio of 50.

ratio of 50: (a) after calcination, (b) after dehydrogenation reaction under
the conditions in Fig. 8 for 5 h, (c) after partial oxidation of CH4 under the
conditions in Table 3 for 5 h.
UV-Raman spectra for the DHT sample with a Si/Cr ra-
tio of 50 after the dehydrogenation of C3H8 and the partial
oxidation of CH4 are shown in Fig. 12. After the dehy-
drogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2, the band at
980 cm−1 disappeared. Because no band was observed for
Cr2O3 at 900–1200 cm−1, the disappearance of the band at
980 cm−1 coincided with the XANES and EXAFS results,
suggesting the transformation of coordination of chromium
from tetrahedron to octahedron. On the other hand, the band
at 980 cm−1 was not signiﬁcantly changed after the partial
oxidation of CH4 with O2. This indicates that the tetrahedral
coordination structure of chromium is kept during the partial
oxidation of CH4 with O2.
3.5. Relationship between catalytic property and
coordination structure of chromium
The fast reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) over alumina-
supported chromia under a C3H8 stream has been detected
by Weckhuysen and co-workers [29] using in situ UV–
vis diffuse reﬂectance spectroscopy through an optical ﬁber
placed in the catalyst bed. The same authors also conﬁrmed
that the turnover frequency for the dehydrogenation of C3H8
was higher for multinuclear Cr(III) than for isolated Cr(III)
sites [59]. In our case, as described above, we found that
the chromate species, either monochromate or polychromate
species on the wall surface of MCM-41, were reduced to ag-
gregated CrIIIOx species after the dehydrogenation of C3H8
in the presence of CO2. It is thus reasonable to speculate
that such aggregated Cr(III) species are responsible for the
dehydrogenation of C3H8. Although the difference in the co-
ordination structure of chromium between the TIE and the
356
Y. Wang et al. / Journal of Catalysis 220 (2003) 347–357
DHT samples was remarkable before reaction as shown by
the UV-Raman spectroscopy, these chromate species were
all transformed to aggregated Cr(III) oxides during the de-
hydrogenation. We think that this can explain the reason that
the DHT and the TIE samples exhibit almost the same cat-
alytic behavior in the dehydrogenation of C3H8.
On the other hand, the chromate species of tetrahedral
coordination were not signiﬁcantly changed after the par-
tial oxidation of CH4 with O2. The oxidative atmosphere is
believed to have kept the high oxidation state of chromium
and the coordination structure. Haller and co-workers [31]
have reported that the reduced Cr(III) with octahedral co-
ordination in MCM-41 or MCM-48 could easily be reox-
idized to tetrahedral Cr(VI) with air. The chromate species
with tetrahedral Cr(VI) on MCM-41 may thus be responsible
for the activation and the conversion of CH4. As described
above, UV-Raman spectroscopy has elucidated that the de-
grees of the polymerization of the chromates over the DHT
and the TIE samples are different. Monochromate species is
mainly detected over the DHT samples, whereas polychro-
mates such as di-, tri-, and tetra-chromates also exist over the
TIE samples besides the monochromate. This must result in
different catalytic behaviors of the two types of samples in
the oxidation of CH4 with O2. The remarkably higher se-
lectivity to HCHO over the DHT samples indicates that the
monochromatespecies, which are highly isolated on the wall
surface of MCM-41, account for the formation of partial oxi-
dation product, i.e., HCHO. The samples by the TIE method,
which contained polychromates, only gave much lower se-
lectivity to HCHO and produced mainly carbon oxides.
4. Conclusions
Chromium could be introduced into MCM-41 by direct
hydrothermal synthesis and template-ion exchange with-
out destroying the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 if the
Si/Cr ratio was kept higher than 25. The DHT method re-
sults in monochromate species on the wall surface of MCM-
41, whereas polychromate species exist in large quantity
besides the monochromate over the samples by the TIE
method. The two types of samples exhibit similar catalytic
property in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon
dioxide. High selectivity and yield to propylene have been
achieved and the presence of carbon dioxide remarkably
enhances the reaction. On the other hand, a distinct dif-
ference in catalytic behavior for the partial oxidation of
methane with oxygen has been observed between the two
series of samples. The samples by the DHT method pro-
vide formaldehyde with higher selectivity at higher methane
conversion than those by the TIE method. It has been eluci-
dated that the chromate species over both types of samples
are reduced to aggregated Cr(III) oxide clusters during the
dehydrogenation of propane, while they are kept during the
oxidation of methane. This is proposed to account for the
different behaviors of the two kinds of samples in the two
catalytic reactions.
