Abstract
Catalytic reduction of NO by propene in the presence of oxygen was studied over SnO2-doped Ga2O3±Al2O3 prepared by
sol±gel method. Although SnO2-doped Ga2O3±Al2O3 gave lower NO conversion than Ga2O3±Al2O3 in the absence of H2O,
the activity was enhanced considerably by the presence of H2O and much higher than that of Ga2O3±Al2O3. The presence of
SnO2 and Ga2O3±Al2O3 species having intimate Ga±O±Al bondings was found to be essential for the promotional effect of
H2O. The promotional effect of H2O was interpreted by the following two reasons. The ®rst one is the removal of
carbonaceous materials deposited on the catalyst surface by H2O. The other is the selective inhibition by H2O of the reaction
steps resulting in propene oxidation to COx without reducing NO. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction
Selective removal of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the
presence of oxygen is an important challenge for
reducing NOx emitted from diesel and lean-burn
engines. Held et al. [1] and Iwamoto et al. [2] reported
that the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with
hydrocarbons proceeds in lean conditions over copper
ion exchanged ZSM-5, following some patent litera-
ture [3,4]. After that, the catalytic reaction has been
studied extensively on a lot of catalysts such as metal
ion exchanged zeolites [5±9], H-form zeolites [10,11],
alumina [12], noble metals [13±15] and transition
metal supported alumina [16,17].
Exhaust gases usually contain H2O affecting the
catalytic performance. Zeolite based catalysts have
been reported to show good activity at high space
velocity in the presence of H2O. However, their
irreversible deactivation due to dealumination from
the framework is a serious problem from a practical
viewpoint [18±20]. On the other hand, alumina based
catalysts are attracting the attention because of their
high stability under hydrothermal conditions. Unfor-
tunately, their catalytic activities are relatively low and
often deteriorated by coexisting H2O. Hence, devel-
opment of new catalysts showing high activity and
durability in the presence of H2O is required.
Teraoka et al. [21] reported that SnO2 showed good
activity for NO reduction by hydrocarbons such as
CH4, C2H4 and C3H8 in the presence of oxygen. We
also reported that the activity of Al2O3 for NO reduc-

tion by methanol is enhanced considerably in the
temperature region below 3508C by addition of Sn
[22]. Recently, Hirao et al. [23] revealed the unique
catalytic behavior of mechanical mixtures of Mn2O3
and Sn-ZSM-5 that the presence of H2O enhanced
considerably the catalytic activity for NO reduction by
propene over the entire temperature range. Thus, SnO2
would be one of the interesting active catalyst com-
ponents for the selective reduction of NO with hydro-
carbons.
We reported recently that Ga2O3±Al2O3 prepared
by sol±gel process showed excellent catalytic activity
at temperatures above 4508C [24]. However, the
effective temperature range is relatively narrow and
the presence of H2O deteriorates the activity. In this
work, we investigated the additive effect of SnO2 on
the activity of Ga2O3±Al2O3. In the course of our
study, we found that SnO2-doped Ga2O3±Al2O3 pre-
pared by sol±gel method showed extremely high NO
reduction activity in the presence of H2O. It was also
discovered that coexisting H2O promoted consider-
ably NO reduction. We wish to report the excellent
catalytic property of SnO2-doped Ga2O3±Al2O3 for
NO reduction by propene in the presence of H2O and
also to discuss the promotional effect of H2O.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
SnO2-doped Ga2O3±Al2O3 catalysts were prepared
by sol±gel method from aluminum boehmite sol pro-
duced by hydrolysis of aluminum(III) tri-isopropoxide
in hot water (908C) with a small amount of nitric acid.
A mixed solution of tin(IV) chloride and gallium(III)
nitrate dissolved in ethylene glycol was added into the
aluminum boehmite sol solution. After the sol solution
was stirred at room temperature for 1 day, the solvents
were removed by heating under reduced pressure,
followed by drying at 1108C and calcination at
6008C for 5 h in ¯owing air. The loading of Ga2O3
was ®xed at 30 wt%, while that of SnO2 was changed
between 0 and 10 wt%. The samples are abbreviated
as SnO2(x)±Ga2O3(y)±Al2O3, where x and y are the
loading (wt%) of SnO2 and Ga2O3, respectively.
SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
is
also
expressed
as
``SG-CAT''.
In order to examine the effect of preparation method
on the catalytic activity, we prepared SnO2(5)-doped
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 by three other different methods;
one is co-impregnation method in which alumina
powder was immersed in an aqueous solution contain-
ing gallium(III) nitrate and tin(IV) chloride, followed
by drying at 1108C and calcination at 6008C for 5 h in
¯owing air. Alumina powder (BET surface area;
200 m2 g-1) used here was synthesized from aluminum
boehmite sol described above, followed by drying at
1108C and calcination at 6008C for 5 h in ¯owing air.
The second method is coprecipitation, where a pre-
cipitate was produced by mixing 10% NH4OH and an
aqueous solution of aluminum(III) nitrate, gallium-
(III) nitrate and tin(IV) chloride. In this procedure, the
pH of the mixed solution was kept at ca. 9. The
precipitate thus obtained was washed with distilled
water, followed by drying at 1108C and calcination at
6008C for 5 h in ¯owing air. The third method is
impregnation
combined
with
sol±gel
process.
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 was ®rst prepared by sol±gel
method
[24].

was
immersed in an aqueous solution of tin(IV) chloride,
followed by drying at 1108C and calcination at 6008C

impregnation, coprecipitation and impregnation com-
bined with sol±gel process will be, hereafter, desig-
nated as ``IMP-CAT'', ``CP-CAT'' and ``SGIMP-
CAT'', respectively.
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
The catalytic activity was measured by using a ®xed
bed ¯ow reactor. The feed gas mixture containing
900 ppm NO (or 930 ppm NO2), 900 ppm C3H6 as a
reducing agent, 10% oxygen and helium as the bal-
ance gas was fed to 0.2 g of a catalyst at a rate of
66 cm3 minÿ1. In some experiments, H2O at a con-
centration of 9.1% was introduced into the reaction
gas mixture with a micropump. In this case, the feed
gas ¯ow rate and the concentrations of the other gas
components remained the same by controlling the
helium ¯ow rate. Steady state reaction data were
obtained while the reaction temperature was changed
from 600 to 2508C with a step of 508C. The ef¯uent
gas was analyzed by gas chromatography. A Mole-
cular Sieve 5A column was used for the analysis of N2
and CO and a Porapak Q column for that of N2O, CO2
290

and C3H6. The catalytic activity was evaluated in
terms of NO conversion to N2 and that of propene
to COx (COCO2). The formation of N2O was found
to be negligible in the present study.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The catalyst surface area was determined with a
conventional ¯ow apparatus (Shimadzu Flowsorb II
2300) by nitrogen adsorption at ÿ1968C. The catalyst
crystallite structure was identi®ed by XRD measure-
ments (Shimadzu XD-D1) using Cu K radiation at
40 kV and 40 mA. The pore size distribution of the
catalysts were calculated, on the basis of DH (Dolli-
more±Heal) theory, from the desorption branches of
nitrogen adsorption isotherms measured at ÿ1968C by
using volumetric adsorption apparatus (BELSORP
28SA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic behavior of SnO2±Ga2O3±Al2O3
3.1.1. Effect of preparation method
Fig. 1 shows the catalytic activity of the four
SnO2(5)-doped Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 catalysts (``IMP-
CAT'',
``CP-CAT'',
``SGIMP-CAT''
and
``SG-
CAT'') along with that of Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 for NO
reduction by propene in the presence and absence of
H2O. As for the reaction in the absence of H2O,
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 showed the highest NO reduction
activity and the activity decreased in the order of
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3>``CP-CAT''>``SGIMP-CAT''>``S-
G-CAT''``IMP-CAT'', indicating that SnO2 sup-
presses the activity of Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3. When
H2O was added into the reaction gas, interesting
catalytic behavior was observed depending upon the
catalyst preparation method. Coexisting H2O caused
activity

of
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3,
``IMP-
CAT'' and ``CP-CAT'' over the entire temperature
range and a shift of the effective temperature window
for NO reduction to higher temperatures. On the
contrary, the activity of ``SGIMP-CAT'' and ``SG-
CAT'' was enhanced considerably by coexisting H2O.
The effect of preparation method strongly suggests
that the presence of both SnO2 and Ga2O3±Al2O3
species is essential for the positive effect of H2O.
3.1.2. Catalyst characterization
The XRD patterns of the four SnO2(5)-doped
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 catalysts prepared here are shown
in Fig. 2. All the catalysts gave similar patterns, in
which the diffraction peaks assigned to g-Al2O3 as

well as g-Ga2O3 [25] or GaAlO3 [26], were observed,
although their peak intensities are slightly different.
No diffraction peaks ascribed to SnO2 were observed.
These results indicate that the crystallite structure of
the catalyst bulk for the four catalysts are similar.
Accordingly, crystallite structure of the catalyst bulk is
obviously not related to the catalytic performance.
The BET surface areas and pore volumes of the four
catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The pore size
distribution curves are also illustrated in Fig. 3.
Although differences in BET surface area were
observed for the four catalysts, BET surface area does
not seem to be related to NO reduction activity. It is,
however, apparent that the pore structure of ``SGIMP-
CAT'' and ``SG-CAT'' was different from that of
``IMP-CAT'' and ``CP-CAT''. As can be seen in
Fig. 3, a broad distribution curve was observed for
the former two catalysts, while relatively sharp peak
centered around 2.5 nm was seen for the latter two
catalysts. It was also found that ``SG-CAT'' and
``SGIMP-CAT''
have
comparatively
large
pore
volume. These results suggest that the unique pore
structure seems to be due to an intimate contact
between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 produced by sol±gel pro-
cess and that this intimate contact might be related to
the promotional effect of H2O observed for ``SGIMP-
CAT'' and ``SG-CAT''.
Sol±gel technique is one of the most useful methods
capable of preparing catalysts with highly dispersed
species through the formation of M1±O±M2 bondings
[27,28]. In the present study, it is presumed that ``SG-
CAT'' includes a lot of M1±O±M2 bondings such as
Ga±O±Al, Ga±O±Sn and Sn±O±Al at the fringe of
catalyst particles. ``SGIMP-CAT'' would also possess
only Ga±O±Al bondings but not Ga±O±Sn and Sn±O±
Al bondings. These two catalysts showed the intensi-
fying effect of H2O on NO reduction by propene.
Ga2O3±Al2O3, however, did not show the promotional
effect of H2O, whereas it has a lot of Ga±O±Al
bondings, suggesting that the presence of SnO2 is
essential for the positive effect of H2O. On the other
hand, ``IMP-CAT'' and ``CP-CAT'', which include
SnO2 but not Ga±O±Al bondings, showed the retard-
ing effect of H2O. Taking into account these facts, we

can conclude that the presence of SnO2 particles
interacting strongly with Ga2O3±Al2O3 having inti-
mate Ga±O±Al bondings is related to the interesting
promotional effect of H2O. The rest of this paper deals
mainly with ``SG-CAT''.
3.1.3. Effect of SnO2 loading and H2O concentration
for NO reduction
The effect of SnO2 loading on the activity of SnO2±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 prepared by sol±gel method for NO
reduction by propene in the presence and absence of
H2O was investigated. Fig. 4 shows the reaction
results obtained in the absence of H2O. The catalytic
activity of Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 decreased considerably
at temperatures above 4008C with SnO2 loading. On
the contrary, propene conversion increased with SnO2
loading. This means that the doped SnO2 inhibits the
selective reduction of NO into N2 by propene. On the
other hand, when H2O was introduced into the reac-
tion gas, quite interesting phenomenon, as shown in
Fig. 5, was observed. It can be seen by comparing
Figs. 4 and 5 that the presence of H2O depressed the
activity of Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 over the entire tempera-
ture range, particularly between 4008C and 5008C. In
the case of SnO2-doped Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3, however, a
considerable promotional effect of H2O on NO con-
version was observed. This tendency seems to be more
prominent with increasing SnO2 loading. Obviously,
the activity of SnO2-doped Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 in the
presence of H2O is much higher than that of
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 at temperatures below 4508C.
The most active catalyst for NO reduction by propene
was SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3. More than 5 wt%
SnO2 loading did not cause further enhancement of
NO reduction activity.
Next, we examined the effect of H2O concentration
on the catalytic activity of SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
for NO reduction by propene at 3508C. As can be seen
in Fig. 6, the conversion of NO into N2 substantially
increased in the presence of a small amount of H2O
(1%) and increased further upon increasing H2O
concentration. On the contrary, propene conversion
into COx decreased gradually with H2O concentration.
The selectivity for NO reduction represented as 2N2/

atoms supplied from NO to all oxygen atoms reacted
with propene to CO and CO2 [11,29,30] is also
indicated
in
Fig. 6.
Apparently,
a
considerable
increase of the NO reduction selectivity with increas-
ing H2O concentration was observed.
3.2. Promotional effect of H2O and roles of catalytic
species
Recently, Hirao et al. [23] reported the promotional
effect of H2O for mechanical mixtures of Mn2O3 and
Sn-ZSM-5 for NO reduction by propene. We also
found that NO conversion on silver ion-exchanged
saponite was increased by addition of H2O at low
temperatures below 4008C [31]. In addition, Ueda
et al. [32] reported a similar positive effect of
H2O on NO reduction by propene over Au/Al2O3.
Although the reasons for the activity enhancement
by H2O have been investigated so far, there are a lot
of ambiguous points yet. In order to examine the
reasons for the promotional effect of H2O, we studied
in detail the roles of H2O and catalytic species in NO
reduction.
3.2.1. Removal of surface carbonaceous materials
The removal of surface carbonaceous materials
deposited on the catalytically active sites is believed
as one of the roles of coexisting H2O [33±36]. We
reported recently that the activity enhancement of
proton-exchanged saponite for NO2±C3H6±O2 reac-
tion by coexisting H2O is due to the removal of surface
carbonaceous materials covering the catalytically
active sites [33]. Misono et al. [34,35] also reported
that the carbon deposits formed by oligomerization or
polymerization during NO reduction by propene over
Mn2O3Sn-ZSM-5 are removed by the reactions such
as steam reforming to form reductants like H2 and CO.
A similar phenomenon is presumed to take place in the
present study.
In order to examine the reaction inhibition by
carbonaceous materials, we made a transient response
experiment to the supply of H2O on SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 at 3508C, as shown in Fig. 7.
The reaction was carried out ®rst in the absence of
H2O (``Region I''). After that, the catalyst sample was
oxidized at 6008C for 1 h in ¯owing 10% O2/He to
remove carbonaceous materials deposited on the cat-
alyst surface during the reaction in ``Region I''. Next,
the reaction was carried out in the absence of H2O
again (``Region II''). After the activity reached steady
state in the ``Region II'', H2O was introduced into the
reaction
gas
(``Region
III'')
and
subsequently
removed from the reaction gas (``Region IV'').
The catalytic activity for NO reduction in the
absence of H2O decreased gradually with reaction
time and then reached steady state in 3 h (``Region
I''). The carbon balance, which is the sum of the

amount of unreacted propene and formed COx in the
ef¯uent gas divided by that of propene in the feed gas,
was low at ®rst and then gradually approached to
100%. At the same time, NO conversion and propene
conversion decreased with time-on-stream. After the
oxidation at 6008C for 1 h, almost the same pro®les as
in ``Region I'' were observed. These facts strongly
suggest that carbonaceous materials are formed on the
catalyst surface during the reduction in the absence of
H2O and inhibit NO reduction.
When H2O was introduced into the reaction gas
(the reaction in ``Region III''), an increase of NO
conversion to N2 as well as a decrease of C3H6
conversion was observed. It should be noted that
the carbon balance increased immediately after the
addition of H2O and then decreased slowly to the
original level (ca. 100%) in the absence of H2O. The
discrepancy between C3H6 conversion and COx yield
at the initial stage of ``Region III'' suggests that COx is
formed from carbonaceous materials deposited on the
catalyst surface. In ``Region IV'' after removal of H2O
again, the catalytic activity returned gradually to the
same initial level as in ``Region I'' and ``Region II''.
On the basis of these results, coexisting H2O is
considered to promote the removal of surface carbo-
naceous materials covering the catalytically active
sites.
Consequently, we can conclude that one of the
reasons for the enhancement effect of H2O for NO
reduction on SnO2±Ga2O3±Al2O3 is to promote the
removal of surface carbonaceous materials deposited
on the catalytically active sites.
3.2.2. Roles of doped SnO2 and Ga2O3±Al2O3 in NO
reduction
It is well known that additives often enhance the
catalytic activity for NO reduction. Their role is in
many cases considered to promote the ®rst reaction
steps such as NO oxidation and partial oxidation of
hydrocarbons. For instance, Co supported on Al2O3
[37], Ce ion exchanged into ZSM-5 [5,6] and Mn2O3
mixed mechanically with Ce-ZSM-5 [38] or with Au/
Al2O3 [39] were reported to promote NO oxidation
into NO2. The promotion of hydrocarbon oxidation
was also proposed for Cu ion exchanged into ZSM-5
[40,41], Pt supported on Al2O3 [40,41] and Co sup-
ported on SiO2 [42]. As described before, ``SGIMP-
CAT'' obtained by impregnating SnO2 onto Ga2O3±
Al2O3 prepared by sol±gel process showed similar
catalytic behavior to ``SG-CAT'' prepared by sol±gel
method, suggesting that SnO2 and Ga2O3±Al2O3 play
independent roles for NO reduction.
3.2.2.1. Comparison of propene oxidation activity
under different reaction systems. We measured the
conversion of propene to COx over Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
and
SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
for
the
reaction
systems
of
NO±C3H6±O2,
C3H6±O2
and
NO2±
C3H6±O2 in the presence and absence of H2O. The
results are shown in Fig. 8. When the reaction was
carried out in the absence of H2O, the activity of
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 for propene oxidation decreased in
the
sequence
of
NO2±C3H6±O2C3H6±O2>NO±
C3H6±O2, suggesting that NO2 formation rate is
sufficiently slow compared with propene oxidation.
Since the conversion of propene to COx on SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 decreased in the order of NO2±
C3H6±O2NO±C3H6±O2>C3H6±O2,
the
same
phenomenon as Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 is presumed to

take place. It is of interest that the activity of SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 for propene oxidation by oxygen
was
comparable
to
that
of
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3.
Probably, the doped-SnO2 does not appreciably
contribute to the activation of propene by oxygen.
Propene might be activated by oxygen on Ga2O3±
Al2O3 to form partially oxidized intermediates.
As can be seen in Fig. 8, the activity of both
catalysts for propene oxidation in all the reaction
systems was decreased considerably by the presence
of H2O. The conversion of propene to COx on
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 decreased in the sequence of
NO2±C3H6±O2C3H6±O2>NO±C3H6±O2. This sug-
gests that the rate of propene oxidation by oxygen
is relatively slow. The slowest reaction step might be
changed from NO oxidation in the absence of H2O to
propene oxidation in the presence of H2O, indicating
that coexisting H2O inhibits mainly propene oxida-
tion. As for propene oxidation by oxygen, interest-
ingly, Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 and SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±
Al2O3 gave the same conversion over the entire tem-
perature range. Propene seems to be activated mainly
on Ga2O3±Al2O3 even in the presence of H2O.
Obviously,

conversion
on
SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 was increased considerably by
the presence of NOx. This result has led us to conclude
that a major role of SnO2 is to accelerate the reaction
of NOx and propene.
3.2.2.2. Comparison of reactivity between NO and
NO2. In order to get more information on the role of
doped-SnO2, the reactivity of NO and NO2 was
compared in the presence and absence of H2O.
Figs. 9 and 10 present the reaction results obtained
for
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
and
SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±
Al2O3, respectively. As for the reaction in the
absence
of
H2O,
the
reactivity
of
NO2
on
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
and
SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
was much higher than that of NO over the entire
temperature range, suggesting that NO oxidation
into NO2 is slow step in NO reduction. This idea is
consistent with the results obtained for propene
oxidation.
On the other hand, as for the reaction in the presence
of H2O, the reactivity of NO2 was found to be higher
than that of NO over Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3, indicating
that the rate for NO oxidation over Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3
is not so fast. Since almost the same reactivity, how-

ever, was observed for NO and NO2 reduction over
SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3, the role of SnO2 is con-
sidered to promote the formation of NO2. It is also
noteworthy
that
NO2
conversion
on
SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 was increased by coexisting H2O,
whereas on Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 NO2 conversion was
decreased considerably. Almost the same results were
obtained for NO reduction. These results would indi-
cate that coexisting H2O affects the reaction paths
after NO oxidation into NO2.
3.3. Proposed reaction mechanism over SnO2-doped
Ga2O3±Al2O3
A lot of reaction mechanisms have been proposed
so far concerning NO reduction by hydrocarbons. In
general, they can be classi®ed into two groups. In the
®rst one, NO dissociates on the catalyst surface and
then hydrocarbons remove oxygen from the surface
and restore the active sites [43±46]. On the other hand,
many researchers refer to the mechanism that N2 is
formed through a series of reaction steps from NO and
hydrocarbon via partially oxidized hydrocarbons or
NO2 [5,6,8,40,41,47±49]. We propose a similar
mechanism to the latter one for the selective reduction
of NO with propene over SnO2±Ga2O3±Al2O3, based
on the experimental results obtained above. The fact
that the presence of SnO2 interacting strongly with
Ga2O3±Al2O3 produced by sol±gel process is essential
for the promotional effect of H2O suggests that inde-
pendent reaction steps would proceed on SnO2 and
Ga2O3±Al2O3.
As the presence of oxygen is generally essential for
NO reduction [7], oxygen would contribute to two
important reaction steps: one is propene oxidation to
partially oxidized hydrocarbons and the other is NO
oxidation to NO2. Because the activity of SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 for propene oxidation by oxygen
was comparable to that of Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 as can be
seen in Fig. 8, the oxidation of propene is not cata-
lyzed by doped-SnO2 but proceeds mainly on Ga2O3±
Al2O3.
C3H6  O2 ! CxHyOz ! COx  H2O
(1)
Propene oxidation on Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 and SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 was found to be accelerated by the
presence of NO2 (Fig. 8). In addition, the reactivity of
NO2 was much higher than that of NO on Ga2O3(30)±
Al2O3 and SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 in the absence
of H2O over the entire temperature range (Figs. 9 and
10). These results suggest that NO oxidation is a slow
step in NO reduction in the absence of H2O. The
formed NO2 might be concentrated by adsorption on
the catalyst surface.
NO  O2 ! NO2 ! NOÿ
3 ads
(2)
We think that NO2 thus formed would be reduced to
N2 by the reaction with partial oxidized hydrocarbon
probably via the formation of organic compounds
containing N and O.
NO2  CxHyOz ! CxHyOzÿN ! N2  COx
(3)
This step might proceed mainly on Ga2O3±Al2O3 in
the absence of H2O, because NO2 conversion over
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 was much higher than that over
SnO2(5)±Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 (Figs. 9 and 10).
Here, we must consider the in¯uence of coexisting
H2O on the reaction mechanism. Fig. 8 indicates that
coexisting H2O inhibits reaction step (1) over Ga2O3±
Al2O3. It was also observed that NO reduction is
inhibited by coexisting H2O over Ga2O3±Al2O3
(Fig. 9). In addition, the rate of NO oxidation, reaction
step (2), on SnO2±Ga2O3±Al2O3 was suf®ciently fast
in the presence of H2O, while on Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 its
rate was not so fast. If the reduction of NO into N2 over
SnO2±Ga2O3±Al2O3 proceeds through reaction steps
(1)±(3), its activity has to be decreased by the presence
of H2O. Therefore, there must be other reaction paths
proceeding on SnO2 sites.
Yokoyama and Misono [5,6] reported that not NO2
but only NO was detected in the ef¯uent gases during
NO2C3H6O2 reaction over Na- and Ce-ZSM-5.
They explained this result by assuming that NO2 reacts
very rapidly with propene to form NO. A similar
experimental result was reported by Bethke et al.
[50]
that
the
reduction
of
NO2
to
NO
for
NONO2C3H6 (or C3H8)O2 reaction over Cu±
ZrO2 was very fast. In the present study, a similar
reaction may proceed during NO2 reduction by pro-
pene over SnO2±Ga2O3±Al2O3. Namely, there are two
competitive reaction steps on SnO2 as follows:
NO2  C3H6 ! NO  COx
(4)
NO2  C3H6 ! N2  COx
(5)
In order to examine the in¯uence of H2O on these
M. Haneda et al. / Applied Catalysis B: Environmental 20 (1999) 289±300
297
reaction steps, we measured the activity of SnO2(5)±
Ga2O3(30)±Al2O3 for direct reduction of NO2 with
propene in the absence of oxygen. The results are
indicated in Fig. 11. If both reaction steps (4) and (5)
are not in¯uenced by coexisting H2O at all, the con-
versions of NO2 and propene in the presence of H2O
would show almost the same as that for the reduction
in its absence. Obviously, the conversions of NO2 and
propene were enhanced considerably by the presence
of H2O. In Fig. 11 are also indicated the ef®ciency of
C3H6 utilization for NO2 reduction into N2 de®ned as
the ratio of `number of NO molecules reduced to N2'
toward `number of C3H6 molecules oxidised to COx'.
It is apparent that the ef®ciency of C3H6 utilization
was improved at the temperatures above 3008C by
coexisting H2O. This result suggests that coexisting
H2O inhibits only the reaction step (4) to form NO and
as a result enhances the rate of the reaction step (5) to
form N2.
As described before, the presence of SnO2 particles
interacting strongly with Ga2O3±Al2O3 having inti-
mate Ga±O±Al bondings is related to the interesting
promotional effect of H2O. In fact, we observed the
retarding effect of H2O on the activity of SnO2±Al2O3
prepared by sol±gel method for NO reduction by
propene
[51].
This
means
the
participation
of
Ga2O3±Al2O3 in the NO reduction in the presence
of H2O. We think that the reactions (3) over Ga2O3±
Al2O3 and reaction (5) over SnO2 take place parallely
in the overall NO reduction in the presence of H2O,
although the rate of the former reaction is relatively
slow. The mechanism of the selective reduction of
NO with propene discussed here is summarized in

4. Conclusions
The following conclusions were obtained concern-
ing SnO2-doped Ga2O3±Al2O3 catalysts for the selec-
tive reduction of NO with propene.
1. As for the reaction in the absence of H2O, SnO2-
doping decreased the activity of Ga2O3±Al2O3 for
NO reduction, irrespective preparation method.
2. The presence of H2O enhanced considerably the
activity of two kinds of SnO2-doped Ga2O3±Al2O3:
one is the catalyst prepared by sol±gel method and
the other is the catalyst prepared by impregnating
SnO2 on Ga2O3±Al2O3 produced by sol±gel pro-
cess. On the other hand, the activity of SnO2-doped
Ga2O3±Al2O3 prepared by co-impregnation or
coprecipitation methods as well as that of Ga2O3±
Al2O3 was depressed by the presence of H2O.
3. It was suggested that the presence of SnO2 and
Ga2O3±Al2O3 species having intimate Ga±O±Al
bondings is essential for the promotional effect of
H2O.
4. The optimum loading of SnO2 with respect to NO
reduction activity in the presence of H2O was
found to be 5 wt% for SnO2-doped Ga2O3±
Al2O3 prepared by sol±gel method.
5. Transient response experiments indicated that one
of the reasons for the promotional effect of H2O is
the removal of carbonaceous materials deposited
on the catalyst surface by H2O.
6. Another reason for the promotional effect of H2O is
related to the selective inhibition of certain reaction
steps by H2O. It was suggested that H2O inhibits
the reaction step of NO2 with propene to form NO
and COx on SnO2 site resulting in propene oxida-
tion to COx without reducing NO.
