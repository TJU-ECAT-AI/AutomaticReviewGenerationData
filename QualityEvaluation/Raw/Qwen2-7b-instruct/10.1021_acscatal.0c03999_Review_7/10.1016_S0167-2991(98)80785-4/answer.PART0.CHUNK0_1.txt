[1] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The activity of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[3] "These findings suggest that CO2 could enhance the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) indicates that the catalyst reducibility and support materials significantly influence catalytic activity. Specifically, the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst exhibited enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, showing a 40% higher yield of C3H6 compared to its performance without CO2. This improvement is attributed to CO2's ability to maintain the surface of Cr203 partially oxidized, which likely enhances the catalyst's reactivity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving oxidation and reduction processes, contributes to the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP. The proposed reaction mechanism involves CO2 interacting with the Fe oxide surface, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane at the boundaries between Fe oxide and SiO2 particles.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能表明，催化剂还原性和支持材料对催化活性有显著影响。具体来说，Cr203/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下的活性明显提高，其C3H6产率比无CO2时高出40%。这种改善归因于CO2维持Cr203表面部分氧化的能力，这可能增强了催化剂的活性。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环，涉及氧化和还原过程，对CO2-ODHP中的催化剂性能产生贡献。提议的反应机制涉及CO2与Fe氧化物表面的相互作用，在Fe氧化物和SiO2颗粒边界促进丙烷的脱氢反应。
