The performance of iron oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Specifically, SiO2-supported catalysts exhibit enhanced activity compared to Al2O3 or active carbon (AC) supports. CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane by enhancing the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized surface of the iron oxide on SiO2 catalyst maintains its activity during the reaction, contributing to the catalytic efficiency in CO2-ODHP.

铁氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响。特别是，二氧化硅支持的催化剂表现出与氧化铝或活性碳（AC）支持相比增强的活性。二氧化碳通过增加丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活来促进丙烷的脱氢反应。铁氧化物在二氧化硅上的部分氧化表面保持其活性，在反应过程中贡献了CO2-ODHP的催化效率。
