The performance of iron oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Specifically, SiO2-supported catalysts exhibit enhanced activity compared to Al2O3 or active carbon (AC) supports. CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane by enhancing the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized surface of the iron oxide on SiO2 catalyst maintains its activity during the reaction, contributing to the catalytic efficiency in CO2-ODHP.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) indicates that the catalyst reducibility and support materials significantly influence catalytic activity. Specifically, the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst exhibited enhanced activity in the presence of CO2, showing a 40% higher yield of C3H6 compared to its performance without CO2. This improvement is attributed to CO2's ability to maintain the surface of Cr203 partially oxidized, which likely enhances the catalyst's reactivity. The redox cycle of Fe oxide, involving oxidation and reduction processes, contributes to the catalyst's performance in CO2-ODHP. The proposed reaction mechanism involves CO2 interacting with the Fe oxide surface, facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane at the boundaries between Fe oxide and SiO2 particles.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Specifically, in the case of Fe2O3 supported on active carbon (Fe2O3/AC), the reducibility affects the catalyst's ability to undergo redox cycles. These cycles are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. When CO2 is present, the surface of the Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst remains partially oxidized, enhancing its activity for dehydrogenation. This indicates that the catalyst's reducibility and the interaction between the metal oxide and the support material play significant roles in determining the catalytic activity, particularly in the context of CO2-ODHP. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation process by maintaining the catalyst's surface in a partially oxidized state, thus increasing its efficiency.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响。特别是对于铁氧化物负载在活性碳（Fe2O3/AC）上，催化剂的还原性影响其进行红ox循环的能力。这些循环对氧化脱氢过程至关重要。当存在二氧化碳时，Fe2O3/SiO2催化剂表面保持部分氧化状态，这增强了其脱氢活性。这表明催化剂的还原性和金属氧化物与支持材料之间的相互作用在确定催化活性方面起着重要作用，特别是在CO2-ODHP的背景下。二氧化碳的存在通过保持催化剂表面处于部分氧化状态来促进脱氢过程，从而提高其效率。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was studied. The results showed that the presence of CO2 had a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. This effect enhanced the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressed the catalyst deactivation. The catalyst's reducibility and the support material, particularly the use of SiO2, played significant roles in enhancing the catalytic activity. The surface of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst was maintained in a partially oxidized state during the reaction in the presence of CO2, which might contribute to the observed enhancement in the dehydrogenation process.

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials, particularly when compared to Fe2O3/AC. The SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts exhibit promoting effects of CO2, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr203 on the SiO2 surface maintains its activity for dehydrogenating C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 is kept partially oxidized, which contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity. Pulse reaction studies further support that CO2 increases the rate of dehydrogenation over the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting the promotion occurs at the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles.

In summary, the reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts, along with the choice of support material, significantly impacts their efficiency in CO2-ODHP. The specific interaction between CO2 and the catalyst surface, especially at the boundaries between metal oxide particles, leads to enhanced catalytic activity and stability.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到其可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是与Fe2O3/AC相比。SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂显示出CO2的促进效果，增强了C3H6的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。部分氧化的Cr203在SiO2表面保持活性以进行C3H8脱氢。在CO2的存在下，Cr203/SiO2表面保持部分氧化，这有助于增强催化活性。脉冲反应研究表明，CO2增加了Cr203/SiO2催化剂中脱氢反应的速度，表明促进作用发生在Cr203和SiO2颗粒之间的边界上。

总之，Fe氧化物催化剂的可还原性以及选择的支持材料显著影响了CO2-ODHP的效率。CO2与催化剂表面的特定相互作用，尤其是在金属氧化物颗粒之间的边界上，导致了增强的催化活性和稳定性。
