<p>The results shown in Figure 3 clearly indicate that the presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6.</p>
<p>This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that the surface of Cr203 on a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr203 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>Pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the yield of C3H6 during the reaction in stream of CO2 and in a stream of He.</p>
<p>The C3H6 yield at the first pulse and the second pulse in the presence of CO2 was found to be higher than those in the absence of CO2.</p>
<p>This promoting effects of CO2 might occur at the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles, as described in 3.1.</p>

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by their reducibility and the support materials, particularly when compared to Fe2O3/AC. The SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts exhibit promoting effects of CO2, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr203 on the SiO2 surface maintains its activity for dehydrogenating C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 is kept partially oxidized, which contributes to the enhanced catalytic activity. Pulse reaction studies further support that CO2 increases the rate of dehydrogenation over the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting the promotion occurs at the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles.

In summary, the reducibility of Fe oxide catalysts, along with the choice of support material, significantly impacts their efficiency in CO2-ODHP. The specific interaction between CO2 and the catalyst surface, especially at the boundaries between metal oxide particles, leads to enhanced catalytic activity and stability.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助下氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）的性能受到其可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是与Fe2O3/AC相比。SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂显示出CO2的促进效果，增强了C3H6的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。部分氧化的Cr203在SiO2表面保持活性以进行C3H8脱氢。在CO2的存在下，Cr203/SiO2表面保持部分氧化，这有助于增强催化活性。脉冲反应研究表明，CO2增加了Cr203/SiO2催化剂中脱氢反应的速度，表明促进作用发生在Cr203和SiO2颗粒之间的边界上。

总之，Fe氧化物催化剂的可还原性以及选择的支持材料显著影响了CO2-ODHP的效率。CO2与催化剂表面的特定相互作用，尤其是在金属氧化物颗粒之间的边界上，导致了增强的催化活性和稳定性。
