The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) was studied. The results showed that the presence of CO2 had a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst. This effect enhanced the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressed the catalyst deactivation. The catalyst's reducibility and the support material, particularly the use of SiO2, played significant roles in enhancing the catalytic activity. The surface of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst was maintained in a partially oxidized state during the reaction in the presence of CO2, which might contribute to the observed enhancement in the dehydrogenation process.

在二氧化碳辅助下进行丙烷的氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中，Fe氧化物基催化剂的表现进行了研究。结果表明，二氧化碳仅对SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂具有促进作用。这种作用增强了丙烯（C3H6）的产率，并抑制了催化剂的失活。催化剂的可还原性以及支撑材料的作用，尤其是使用SiO2，对提高催化活性起到了重要作用。Cr203/SiO2催化剂表面在CO2存在的反应过程中被维持在部分氧化状态，这可能有助于观察到的脱氢过程增强。
