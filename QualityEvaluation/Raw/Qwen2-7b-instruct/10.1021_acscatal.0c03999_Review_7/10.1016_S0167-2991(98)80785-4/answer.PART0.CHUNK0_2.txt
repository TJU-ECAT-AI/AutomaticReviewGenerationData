The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials. Specifically, in the case of Fe2O3 supported on active carbon (Fe2O3/AC), the reducibility affects the catalyst's ability to undergo redox cycles. These cycles are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. When CO2 is present, the surface of the Fe2O3/SiO2 catalyst remains partially oxidized, enhancing its activity for dehydrogenation. This indicates that the catalyst's reducibility and the interaction between the metal oxide and the support material play significant roles in determining the catalytic activity, particularly in the context of CO2-ODHP. The presence of CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation process by maintaining the catalyst's surface in a partially oxidized state, thus increasing its efficiency.

铁氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响。特别是对于铁氧化物负载在活性碳（Fe2O3/AC）上，催化剂的还原性影响其进行红ox循环的能力。这些循环对氧化脱氢过程至关重要。当存在二氧化碳时，Fe2O3/SiO2催化剂表面保持部分氧化状态，这增强了其脱氢活性。这表明催化剂的还原性和金属氧化物与支持材料之间的相互作用在确定催化活性方面起着重要作用，特别是在CO2-ODHP的背景下。二氧化碳的存在通过保持催化剂表面处于部分氧化状态来促进脱氢过程，从而提高其效率。
