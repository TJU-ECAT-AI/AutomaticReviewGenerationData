[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons. Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption. In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane. In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

Analysis reveals that CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, and competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces. It prevents olefin polymerization and decreases propane conversion by inhibiting olefin adsorption. In gallium systems, CO2 notably hinders propylene formation, likely due to oxidizing reduced gallium oxide species. In contrast, chromium systems see increased propylene yield and stability, mainly due to CO2-induced coke and hydrogen oxidation, outweighing negative effects.

分析表明，二氧化碳不仅作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，还会与烃类竞争吸附在催化剂表面上。它通过阻止烯烃聚合并抑制丙烷吸附来降低丙烷转化率。在镓系统中，二氧化碳显著阻碍丙烯形成，可能是因为氧化了还原态镓氧化物物种。相比之下，铬系统由于二氧化碳导致的焦炭和氢的氧化，主要促进了丙烯产量和稳定性增加，从而抵消了负面影响。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. When CO2 is introduced, it acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, competing with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface. This competition affects the formation of propylene and can lead to a decrease in its yield. In the case of Fe2O3/AC, the presence of reduced Fe oxide species is essential for the dehydrogenation of propane, and their oxidation by CO2 complicates this process. However, in chromium systems, the positive effects of CO2, such as the increase in propylene yield and catalyst stability through the oxidation of coke and hydrogen, outweigh the negative impacts.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环对催化活性至关重要。当引入CO2时，它作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，并与碳氢化合物竞争吸附在催化剂表面上。这种竞争影响丙烯的形成并可能导致其产率下降。对于Fe2O3/AC，在存在还原性Fe氧化物种的情况下，对于丙烷脱氢是必要的，而CO2对其氧化会复杂化这一过程。然而，在铬系统中，CO2的正面效果，如通过氧化焦炭和氢气增加丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性，超过了负面影响。

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The reducibility of the Fe oxide catalyst affects its ability to facilitate the redox cycle, which is crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. The support material, such as activated carbon (AC), plays a role in maintaining the stability of the catalyst and influencing the dispersion of the active phase on the surface. The presence of acid hydroxyls on the support materials contributes to the formation of a disperse active surface, which is beneficial for enhancing the catalytic activity.

The introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane alters the reaction pathway and product distribution. It acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, preventing their formation. In the case of gallium-based catalysts, CO2 competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption sites, leading to a decrease in propylene yield due to the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species. Conversely, in chromium-based catalysts, the oxidation of coke and hydrogen by CO2 increases the yield of propylene and enhances the stability of the operation, outweighing the negative effects of CO2.

Using low-acidity silicate supports in the preparation of catalysts for dehydrogenation significantly decreases coke formation and extends the effective operational times of both chromium (Cr)- and gallium (Ga)-containing systems. The acid hydroxyls present on these supports are essential in the formation of a disperse active surface, which contributes to the improved catalytic performance.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在CO2辅助氧化脱氢丙烷（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受到催化剂可还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。催化剂的可还原性影响其促进还原循环的能力，这是氧化脱氢过程的关键。支持材料，如活化碳（AC），在维持催化剂稳定性以及活性相在表面的分散上发挥作用。支持材料上的酸羟基对于形成分散的活性表面至关重要，这有助于增强催化活性。

在丙烷脱氢过程中引入CO2改变了反应途径和产品分布。它作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，防止它们的形成。对于以镓为基础的催化剂，CO2与烃类竞争吸附位点，导致丙烯产量下降，因为氧化了减少的镓氧化物种。相反，在铬为基础的催化剂中，CO2通过氧化焦炭和氢气增加了丙烯的产率和操作稳定性，超过了CO2的负面影响。

使用低酸度硅酸盐支持材料在脱氢催化剂的制备中显著减少了焦炭形成并延长了Cr-和Ga-包含系统的有效运行时间。这些支持材料上的酸羟基对于形成分散的活性表面至关重要，这有助于改善催化性能。
