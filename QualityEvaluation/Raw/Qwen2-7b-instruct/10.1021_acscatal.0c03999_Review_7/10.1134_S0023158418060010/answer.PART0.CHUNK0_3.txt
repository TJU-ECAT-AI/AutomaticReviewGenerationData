[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propan and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons."
[2] "The introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane."
[3] "In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

The performance of Fe oxide-based catalysts in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) is influenced by catalyst reducibility and support materials, particularly in Fe2O3/AC. The redox cycle of Fe oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity. When CO2 is introduced, it acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, competing with hydrocarbons for adsorption on the catalyst surface. This competition affects the formation of propylene and can lead to a decrease in its yield. In the case of Fe2O3/AC, the presence of reduced Fe oxide species is essential for the dehydrogenation of propane, and their oxidation by CO2 complicates this process. However, in chromium systems, the positive effects of CO2, such as the increase in propylene yield and catalyst stability through the oxidation of coke and hydrogen, outweigh the negative impacts.

Fe氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的性能受催化剂还原性和支持材料的影响，特别是Fe2O3/AC。Fe氧化物的氧化还原循环对催化活性至关重要。当引入CO2时，它作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，并与碳氢化合物竞争吸附在催化剂表面上。这种竞争影响丙烯的形成并可能导致其产率下降。对于Fe2O3/AC，在存在还原性Fe氧化物种的情况下，对于丙烷脱氢是必要的，而CO2对其氧化会复杂化这一过程。然而，在铬系统中，CO2的正面效果，如通过氧化焦炭和氢气增加丙烯产率和催化剂稳定性，超过了负面影响。
