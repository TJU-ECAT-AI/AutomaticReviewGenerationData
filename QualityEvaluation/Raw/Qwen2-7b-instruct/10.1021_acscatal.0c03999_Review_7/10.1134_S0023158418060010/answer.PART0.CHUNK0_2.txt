[1] "The analysis of relaxations upon the introduction of CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane and the mutual displacement of carbon dioxide with propane and propylene showed that not only CO2 is an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, but also it is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts competitively with the hydrocarbons. Preventing the adsorption of olefins, carbon dioxide prevents their subsequent polymerization, and it decreases the conversion of propane by preventing its adsorption. In the case of gallium systems, the introduction of CO2 significantly complicates the formation of propylene and leads to a decrease in its yield. A reason for this can be the oxidation of reduced gallium oxide species by carbon dioxide because the presence of these species is necessary for the dehydrogenation of propane. In the case of chromium systems, the increase in the yield of propylene and the stability of operation due to the oxidation of coke and hydrogen upon the introduction of CO2 prevail over the negative influence."

Analysis reveals that CO2 acts as an oxidizing agent for hydrogen and coke, and competes with hydrocarbons for adsorption on catalyst surfaces. It prevents olefin polymerization and decreases propane conversion by inhibiting olefin adsorption. In gallium systems, CO2 notably hinders propylene formation, likely due to oxidizing reduced gallium oxide species. In contrast, chromium systems see increased propylene yield and stability, mainly due to CO2-induced coke and hydrogen oxidation, outweighing negative effects.

分析表明，二氧化碳不仅作为氢和焦炭的氧化剂，还会与烃类竞争吸附在催化剂表面上。它通过阻止烯烃聚合并抑制丙烷吸附来降低丙烷转化率。在镓系统中，二氧化碳显著阻碍丙烯形成，可能是因为氧化了还原态镓氧化物物种。相比之下，铬系统由于二氧化碳导致的焦炭和氢的氧化，主要促进了丙烯产量和稳定性增加，从而抵消了负面影响。
