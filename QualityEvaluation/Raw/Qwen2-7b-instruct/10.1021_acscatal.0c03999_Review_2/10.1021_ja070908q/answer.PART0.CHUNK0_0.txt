Promoters, such as cerium (Ce) and zirconium (Zr), are used to address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. These materials enhance CO2 activation and improve the oxidizing ability compared to traditional chromium-based catalysts. By incorporating Ce and Zr ions into the catalyst structure, the materials achieve selective and stable catalytic performance. This approach facilitates the adsorption and activation of CO2 molecules, enhancing their reactivity. In comparison to O2 co-feeding strategies, the use of promoters provides a more efficient and straightforward method for CO2 activation.
