Promoters in Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solutions improve CO2 activation, enhance oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to O2 co-feeding, these promoters offer specific advantages in addressing CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems.
