The research explores the use of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 for the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. It was discovered that the acid strength of these samples decreases in the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic test follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the optimal catalyst for the production of propylene from C4-olefin cracking, and its stability increased with a smaller crystal size.

The introduction of promoters, such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn), in the Ni-Al2O3 catalysts results in a reduction of the surface area and a decrease in the catalytic activity over time. Specifically, the addition of calcium, manganese, and tin leads to a dramatic reduction in catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition during the study period. In contrast, the potassium-modified catalyst shows lower carbon deposition and maintains high stability in its catalytic activity for 30 hours. The promoter potassium hinders carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, increases reducibility, likely modifies the metal-support interaction, and does not alter the size or structure of the nickel particles. This suggests that potassium is advantageous over alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

Promoters, such as cerium (Ce) and zirconium (Zr), are used to address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems.
