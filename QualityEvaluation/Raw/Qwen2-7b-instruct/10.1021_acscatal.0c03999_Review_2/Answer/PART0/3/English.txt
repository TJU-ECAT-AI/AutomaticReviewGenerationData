Promoters have been employed to tackle the challenges posed by CO2's low oxidation capability and inertness within chromium-based catalytic systems. They provide specific benefits over alternative methods such as oxygen co-feeding, particularly in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving the catalyst's oxidizing capability, and ensuring both selectivity and stability in the catalytic process.
