Promoters have undergone extensive research to address the weaknesses of CO2's low oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. These additives improve CO2 activation and enhance the catalyst's oxidizing ability, contributing to selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative methods like oxygen co-feeding, promoters offer cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits.
