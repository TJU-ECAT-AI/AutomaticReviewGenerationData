          [1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas."
          [2] "At that same reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. 1c, CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98% at a temperature 150 K less than that of methane dry reforming (DRM)."
          [3] "Furthermore, in the CO2+C3H8 system unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + Cs 2CO) at temperatures as low as 773 K with moderate rates."
          [4] "While there are studies that examine the CO2-ODHP or DRP separately, a thorough examination utilizing supported bimetallic catalysts at a temperature range that allows both pathways to occur is still lacking."
          [5] "Results for conversions and product selectivity following time on stream for all catalysts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1."
          [6] "Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts."
          [7] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a)."
          [8] "The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to calculate the change in energy for the oxidative CH and CC bond scission of propane."
          [9] "According to the DFT calculations, on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111),the *O insertion reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O *CH3CH2CH2O + *) along the CC bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.75 eV and Ea = 1.07 eV) is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O *CH3CHCH2 + *OH) along the CH bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.51 eV and Ea = 1.33 eV)."

          Promoters enhance CO2 activation and improve oxidizing ability by overcoming the weak oxidation potential and inertness of CO2 in chromium-based systems. They offer several advantages over strategies like O2 co-feeding. Specifically, they enable selective and stable catalytic performance without the risks associated with high chromium toxicity and severe coking issues encountered with nickel. By facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, promoters allow for the efficient use of underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. The combination of chromium and nickel in bimetallic systems provides a versatile platform for optimizing reaction pathways, with Fe3Ni favoring the CO2-ODHP pathway for propylene production and Ni3Pt being active for dry reforming with high CO selectivity.

          促进剂通过克服CO2在铬基系统中的弱氧化电势和惰性，增强了CO2的激活能力和氧化能力。它们相对于O2共供等策略提供了一系列优势，特别是在避免高铬毒性以及镍引起的严重结焦问题方面。通过促进丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应，促进剂允许有效利用未充分利用的反应物来生产丙烯或合成气。双金属体系（如Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt）结合了铬和镍，提供了优化反应途径的灵活平台。Fe3Ni有利于CO2-ODHP途径以产生丙烯，而Ni3Pt则在干重整中表现出高CO选择性，同时实现了选择性和稳定性的催化性能。

          [1] "The inherent variability and insufficiencies in the co-production of propylene from steam crackers has raised concerns regarding the global propylene production gap and has directed industry to develop more on-purpose propylene technologies."
          [2] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
          [3] "At that same reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. 1c, CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98% at a temperature 150 K less than that of methane dry reforming (DRM)."
          [4] "Furthermore, in the CO2+C3H8 system unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + Cs 2CO) at temperatures as low as 773 K with moderate rates."

          [6] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression."
          [7] "Results for conversions and product selectivity following time on stream for all catalysts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1."
          [8] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometals (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
          [9] "Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts."
          [10] "As seen in Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission."
