          [1] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."
          [2] "However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."
          [3] "This situation leads to the need of developing Ni catalysts with improved activity and selectivity in order to prevent or reduce the formation of carbon, through research into the following aspects: (i) the nature of the support [17], (ii) the support and catalyst preparation method [3,811], and (iii) the addition of promoters [2,9,12,13]."
          [4] "Hou et al. [3] studied the influence of Ca on the performance of Ni/a-Al2O3 catalysts in the dry reforming reaction, reporting that it depends upon the properties of the support and the amount of added Ca."
          [5] "Small amounts of Ca increase the catalyst activity and stability. Ca improves Ni diffusion, strengthens Ni-Al2O3 interaction and delays Ni sintering."
          [6] "However, an excess of Ca promotes carbon deposition, readily deactivating the catalyst."
          [7] "Stagg et al. [16] report the promoting effect of Sn on Pt catalysts if special preparation methods are used, resulting in the controlled placement of Sn on the Pt particle, minimizing the promotersupport interaction."
          [8] "In this paper, the effect of the addition of the metals K, Ca, Mn, and Sn to a Ni-Al2O3 catalyst obtained via solgel is studied."
          [9] "The addition of Mn produced a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, with a small decrease in catalytic activity."
          [10] "Compared to the unmodified catalyst, only Co, Cu and Zr showed a slight improvement in activity, while the rest of the additives reduced the activity in dry reforming."
          [11] "In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."
          [12] "The results obtained in this work with the K-containing catalysts can be explained on the basis of these conclusions."
          [13] "Potassium and other additives are selectively located on the step edges of the nickel surface. To prevent the nucleation of carbon, a small fraction of active sites have to be blocked on the stepped nickel surface."
          [14] "Also, it is well known [25,26] that potassium is a good catalyst for carbon gasification."
          [15] "In the case of the Ni-Ca, Ni-Mn and Ni-Sn-modified catalysts, the situation seems different since after 30 h on stream they show a significant reduction in activity and also important accumulation of deactivating carbon."

          The introduction of promoters, such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn), in the Ni-Al2O3 catalysts results in a reduction of the surface area and a decrease in the catalytic activity over time. Specifically, the addition of calcium, manganese, and tin leads to a dramatic reduction in catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition during the study period. In contrast, the potassium-modified catalyst shows lower carbon deposition and maintains high stability in its catalytic activity for 30 hours. The promoter potassium hinders carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, increases reducibility, likely modifies the metal-support interaction, and does not alter the size or structure of the nickel particles. This suggests that potassium is advantageous over alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

          在Ni-Al2O3催化剂中引入促进剂，如钾（K）、钙（Ca）、锰（Mn）和锡（Sn），会导致表面积的减少和催化活性随时间的下降。具体来说，钙、锰和锡的添加导致了催化活性的显著降低和碳沉积量的增加。相反，钾改性催化剂显示了较低的碳沉积和在30小时内的高稳定性催化活性。钾促进剂阻碍了催化剂表面的碳积累，增加了可还原性，可能修改了金属-支撑相互作用，并且没有改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。这表明钾相对于氧气共供给等替代策略，在增强CO2激活、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能方面具有优势。

          [2] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."
          [3] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction. However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."

          [10] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."
          [11] "It has been proposed that potassium migrates from the support to the surface of nickel and neutralizes a fraction of the most active sites for the reforming reaction producing, as a consequence, a decrease in methane conversion."

          The CO2 reforming of methane, particularly for generating synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio, holds significance in the industry, particularly for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network. Nickel is commonly used as a catalyst for this reaction due to its availability and low cost, but it is prone to deactivation from carbon deposition on the active sites. The nature of the promoter and the amount used play a crucial role in the performance of the catalyst. Specifically, small amounts of calcium can increase the catalyst activity and stability. Among various additives tested, only cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zr) showed a slight improvement in activity, whereas others reduced the activity in dry reforming processes. The addition of manganese (Mn) leads to a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, albeit with a small decrease in catalytic activity. The unmodified catalyst demonstrated exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability in methane CO2 reforming reactions. The potassium-modified catalyst exhibited low carbon deposition and maintained a stable catalytic activity over 30 hours of operation. Compared to the unmodified catalyst, the potassium-added catalyst experienced a minor decrease in methane conversion of around 4% and a significant reduction in carbon deposition exceeding 17%. It has been suggested that potassium migrates from the support to the surface of nickel and neutralizes a fraction of the most active sites for the reforming reaction, leading to a decrease in methane conversion.

          干重整甲烷，特别是生成具有低H2/CO比率的合成气，在工业中尤为重要，特别是在费希尔-特罗普斯合成网络中。由于其可用性和低成本，镍通常用作这种反应的催化剂，但它容易因活性中心上碳沉积而失效。促进剂的性质和使用的量在催化剂性能中起着关键作用。特别是小量的钙可以增加催化剂的活性和稳定性。在测试的各种添加剂中，只有钴（Co）、铜（Cu）和锌（Zr）显示出轻微的活性改善，而其他添加剂则降低了干重整过程中的活性。添加锰（Mn）导致了碳沉积量的显著减少，尽管伴随着轻微的活性下降。未改性的催化剂在甲烷二氧化碳重整反应中表现出极高的活性、选择性和耐久性。钾改性催化剂显示出较低的碳沉积和在30小时运行中保持稳定的催化活性。与未改性催化剂相比，钾添加的催化剂的甲烷转化率减少了约4%，碳沉积减少了超过17%。有人提出，钾从支撑转移到镍表面，并中和了重整反应中最活跃位点的一部分，导致甲烷转化率的降低。
