Promoters enhance CO2 activation and improve oxidizing ability by overcoming the weak oxidation potential and inertness of CO2 in chromium-based systems. They offer several advantages over strategies like O2 co-feeding. Specifically, they enable selective and stable catalytic performance without the risks associated with high chromium toxicity and severe coking issues encountered with nickel. By facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, promoters allow for the efficient use of underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. The combination of chromium and nickel in bimetallic systems provides a versatile platform for optimizing reaction pathways, with Fe3Ni favoring the CO2-ODHP pathway for propylene production and Ni3Pt being active for dry reforming with high CO selectivity.

Promoters, including Zn, Ni, and Cu, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by improving the oxidizing ability of these catalysts. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

Promoters such as tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), and phosphorus (P) can address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation. These additives improve the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, resulting in enhanced selectivity and stability. Compared to alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding, promoters provide a more efficient means of activating CO2 by increasing the surface area and porosity of the catalyst.

The CO2 reforming of methane, particularly for generating synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio, holds significance in the industry, particularly for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network. Nickel is commonly used as a catalyst for this reaction due to its availability and low cost, but it is prone to deactivation from carbon deposition on the active sites. The nature of the promoter and the amount used play a crucial role in the performance of the catalyst. Specifically, small amounts of calcium can increase the catalyst activity and stability. Among various additives tested, only cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zr) showed a slight improvement in activity, whereas others reduced the activity in dry reforming processes. The addition of manganese (Mn) leads to a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, albeit with a small decrease in catalytic activity. The unmodified catalyst demonstrated exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability in methane CO2 reforming reactions. The potassium-modified catalyst exhibited low carbon deposition and maintained a stable catalytic activity over 30 hours of operation. Compared to the unmodified catalyst, the potassium-added catalyst experienced a minor decrease in methane conversion of around 4% and a significant reduction in carbon deposition exceeding 17%. It has been suggested that potassium migrates from the support to the surface of nickel and neutralizes a fraction of the most active sites for the reforming reaction, leading to a decrease in methane conversion.
