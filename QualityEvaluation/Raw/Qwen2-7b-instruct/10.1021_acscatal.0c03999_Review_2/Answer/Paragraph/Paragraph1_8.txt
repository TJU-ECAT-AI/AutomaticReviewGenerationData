        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.apcata.2007.11.041\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2019.04.016\], \[10.1021/ja070908q\], and \[10.1021/acscatal.0c03999_2\]. Enhanced CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalysts are achieved through strategic incorporation of promoters such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn). These elements not only address CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness but also offer distinct advantages over alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding. Specifically, K promotes a reduction in carbon deposition, boosts reducibility, and modifies metal-support interactions without altering nickel particle size, thereby enhancing the selective and stable catalytic performance. In the context of propane dehydrogenation, the optimal adding time of chromium (Cr) in the sol-gel process is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance, as detailed in reference \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2019.04.016\]. The use of bimetallic catalysts like iron-iron (Fe3Ni) and nickel-platinum (Ni3Pt) further highlights the potential of promoters in improving activity and selectivity for CO2 utilization, as outlined in reference \[10.1038/s41467-018-03793-w\].
