[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range [Z]."
[3] "The presence of the relatively weak C-O bond in methanol enables the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes at moderate temperatures."
[4] "Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process [3]."
[5] "By the action of the strong acid groups these can be cracked to the reactive small alkenes mentioned above."
[6] "Small alkanes (which are abundantly formed in petroleum refining processes) are more difficult to convert to reactive alkenes [6,7,8]."
[7] "The conversion of propane to higher products over the H-ZSM-5 catalyst as function of temperature is depicted in Figure 1. As can be seen the activity of the purely acidic zeolite was very small."
[8] "Under the same experimental conditions H-ZSM-5 physically mixed with 6 wt.% Pt/SiO2 was more active in the propane conversion."
[9] "Only at high temperature traces of butanes and pentanes were formed."
[10] "The product distributions obtained with the Pt loaded catalysts showed a number of interesting features (see Figure 2)."

Propane can be converted to products with more than 3 carbon atoms by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5. Zeolites with Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores lead to better results than physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt; the conversion is higher and almost no deactivation occurs. At least two steps can be distinguished: formation of propene over Pt and subsequent oligomerization over acid sites of the zeolite. Moreover, a number of inevitable side reactions occur: Pt catalyzed hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis and acid catalyzed cracking. The main higher hydrocarbons formed are normal and iso butane. The high nC/iC ratio suggests that at reaction temperatures the propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite.

通过将铂和H-ZSM-5结合使用，丙烷可以被转化为含有超过3个碳原子的产品。将Pt掺入到沸石孔中的沸石比物理混合的沸石和支持的Pt有更好的效果；转化率更高且几乎没有失活。至少可以区分两个步骤：在铂上形成丙烯，然后在沸石酸性位点上进行多聚化。此外，还会发生一系列不可避免的副反应：铂催化的氢化、氢解和酸催化裂解。主要的高碳化合物是正丁烷和异丁烷。高nC/iC比率表明，在反应温度下，丙烯多聚化由H-ZSM-5沸石的形状选择性控制。
