Propane can be converted to products with more than 3 carbon atoms by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5. Zeolites with Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores lead to better results than physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt; the conversion is higher and almost no deactivation occurs.

[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range [Z]."
[3] "The presence of the relatively weak C-O bond in methanol enables the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes at moderate temperatures."
[4] "Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process [3]."
[5] "By the action of the strong acid groups these can be cracked to the reactive small alkenes mentioned above."
[6] "Small alkanes (which are abundantly formed in petroleum refining processes) are more difficult to convert to reactive alkenes [6,7,8]."
[7] "The conversion of propane to higher products over the H-ZSM-5 catalyst as function of temperature is depicted in Figure 1. As can be seen the activity of the purely acidic zeolite was very small."
[8] "Under the same experimental conditions H-ZSM-5 physically mixed with 6 wt.% Pt/SiO2 was more active in the propane conversion."
[9] "Only at high temperature traces of butanes and pentanes were formed."
[10] "The product distributions obtained with the Pt loaded catalysts showed a number of interesting features (see Figure 2)."

Propane can be converted to products with more than 3 carbon atoms by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5. Zeolites with Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores lead to better results than physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt; the conversion is higher and almost no deactivation occurs. At least two steps can be distinguished: formation of propene over Pt and subsequent oligomerization over acid sites of the zeolite. Moreover, a number of inevitable side reactions occur: Pt catalyzed hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis and acid catalyzed cracking. The main higher hydrocarbons formed are normal and iso butane. The high nC/iC ratio suggests that at reaction temperatures the propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite.

通过将铂和H-ZSM-5结合使用，丙烷可以被转化为含有超过3个碳原子的产品。将Pt掺入到沸石孔中的沸石比物理混合的沸石和支持的Pt有更好的效果；转化率更高且几乎没有失活。至少可以区分两个步骤：在铂上形成丙烯，然后在沸石酸性位点上进行多聚化。此外，还会发生一系列不可避免的副反应：铂催化的氢化、氢解和酸催化裂解。主要的高碳化合物是正丁烷和异丁烷。高nC/iC比率表明，在反应温度下，丙烯多聚化由H-ZSM-5沸石的形状选择性控制。

The study investigates the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures over a Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. It is found that the presence of platinum particles within the zeolite pores near the acid sites enhances the conversion efficiency. This is attributed to the shape-selective properties of the zeolite, which prevent coke deposition on the active Pt sites. The conversion process involves two main steps: first, dehydrogenation of propane to propene by platinum, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. At lower temperatures, the main higher hydrocarbon formed is butane. The results suggest that during the propane conversion, platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms net.+ C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the formation of low hydrocarbons and mainly saturated hydrocarbons. The study indirectly indicates that at higher temperatures, propene oligomerizes to linear or singly branched products due to steric constraints.

研究探讨了在适度温度下使用Pt/H-ZSM-5催化剂将丙烷转化为更高碳原子数产物的情况。发现铂颗粒位于沸石孔附近酸性位点内，对转化效率有积极影响。这归因于沸石的选择性形状特性，可防止活性铂位点上焦炭沉积。转化过程包括两个主要步骤：首先，铂催化丙烷脱氢生成丙烯，然后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上发生聚合反应。较低温度下，主要的较高碳原子数产物是丁烷。研究间接表明，在较高温度下，丙烯会聚合成线性或单分支产物，这是由于空间约束导致的。

[1] "The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane. Firstly the deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5. This can be explained by an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5."
[2] "The conversion experiments over Pt/Na-ZSM-5 support this assumption."
[3] "The effect of WHSV on the conversion of propane over the 0.4 wt% Pt./H-ZSM-5 catalyst also leads to the conclusion that the mechanism consists of 2 consequetive steps."
[4] "As can be seen in Table I practically no alkenes are formed. Most likely Pt not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane but also the hydrogenation of subsequent formed alkenes."
[5] "Although this hydrogenolysis reaction is unfavorable because it leads to products less valuable than propane, it also has a positive effect because it causes a diminishing of the hydrogen partial pressure and thus will stimulate the propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The fact that the H/C ratio does not change during reaction implies that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form; the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully used for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."
[7] "We expected that an additional withdrawal of hydrogen from the reaction mixture would drive the dehydrogenation of propane. For this purpose we added 20% oxygen to the feed. However this did not result in a higher conversion."
[8] "We showed that activation of propane is possible by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5. Impregnation of the zeolite with Pt leads to better results than physically mixing with Pt/SiO2. The conversion is much higher and the catalyst shows almost no deactivation."
[9] "The propane conversion consists of two main steps; first dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by an oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite."

1. The Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites inhibit the formation of coke on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5, leading to a smaller deactivation rate compared to a physical mixture of Pt/SiO2 and H-ZSM-5. This supports the assumption that the Pt/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst also behaves similarly. The mechanism of propane conversion over the 0.4 wt% Pt./H-ZSM-5 catalyst involves two consecutive steps, and the Pt not only catalyzes the dehydrogenation of propane but also hydrogenates the subsequent formed alkenes. This hydrogenolysis reaction, although unfavorable, stimulates the propane dehydrogenation by diminishing the hydrogen partial pressure. There is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form during the reaction, as the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully utilized for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis. Adding 20% oxygen to the feed did not result in a higher conversion. Using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5 leads to higher conversion and almost no deactivation compared to physically mixing with Pt/SiO2. The propane conversion mechanism includes two main steps: dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite.

1. Pt颗粒位于择形沸石分子筛的孔内接近酸性位点附近，由于择形沸石-5的形状选择性特性抑制了Pt颗粒上的焦炭形成，导致与物理混合的Pt/SiO2和H-ZSM-5相比，催化剂失活率较小。这支持了Pt/Na-ZSM-5催化剂也具有类似行为的假设。0.4 wt% Pt./H-ZSM-5催化剂的机制涉及两个连续步骤，并且Pt不仅催化丙烷的脱氢，还催化随后形成的烯烃的氢化。虽然这个氢解反应是不利的，但它通过减少氢分压刺激了丙烷的脱氢。反应过程中没有分子形式的氢损失，因为由丙烯形成的氢完全用于氢化和氢解。向流体中添加20%氧气并未导致更高的转化率。使用铂和择形沸石-5的组合比物理混合的Pt/SiO2导致更高的转化率和几乎无失活。丙烷转化机制包括两个主要步骤：首先由Pt催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯，然后丙烯在择形沸石的酸性位点上发生缩合。

The study highlights the synergistic effect of combining platinum (Pt) and H-ZSM-5 zeolite in converting propane to higher hydrocarbons. The Pt particles within the zeolite pores near the acid sites enhance the conversion efficiency. Firstly, this arrangement minimizes the deactivation rate compared to a physical mixture of Pt and H-ZSM-5, as the shape-selective properties of H-ZSM-5 inhibit coke formation on the Pt particles. Secondly, the proximity of Pt to the acid sites facilitates a bifunctional catalysis, enabling both dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Pt and oligomerization over the zeolite's acid sites. The Pt catalyst is directly involved in the conversion of propane to methane and ethane under certain conditions, while in others, higher products undergo hydrogenolysis, primarily forming ethane. The constant H/C ratio throughout the reaction indicates efficient use of hydrogen, either for hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis processes.

研究强调了将铂（Pt）与H-ZSM-5沸石结合在丙烷转化为更高碳数化合物中的协同作用。在沸石孔内的Pt颗粒附近，酸性位点的存在显著提高了转化效率。首先，这种配置减少了与物理混合的Pt和H-ZSM-5相比的失活率，因为沸石的形状选择性特性抑制了Pt颗粒上的焦炭形成。其次，Pt靠近酸性位点的布置促进了双功能催化，使丙烷在Pt上脱氢为丙烯，并且在沸石的酸性位点上进行多聚化。在某些条件下，Pt催化剂直接将丙烷转化为甲烷和乙烷，而在其他情况下，较高产物则通过氢解主要形成乙烷。在整个反应过程中保持恒定的H/C比率表明氢的高效利用，既可以用于氢化也可以用于氢解过程。
