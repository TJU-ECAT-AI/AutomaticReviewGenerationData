[1] "The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane. Firstly the deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5. This can be explained by an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5."
[2] "Secondly the conversion is higher when the Pt is in the vicinity of the acid sites. This suggests that the reaction of propane over the Pt loaded catalysts is bifunctional catalyzed."
[3] "It seems that over the 4 wt% Pt zeolite propane is directly cleaved to methane and ethane, while over the catalyst with the lower Pt content higher products are hydrogenolysed to ethane (and propane)."
[4] "The fact that the H/C ratio does not change during reaction implies that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form; the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully used for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."

The study highlights the synergistic effect of combining platinum (Pt) and H-ZSM-5 zeolite in converting propane to higher hydrocarbons. The Pt particles within the zeolite pores near the acid sites enhance the conversion efficiency. Firstly, this arrangement minimizes the deactivation rate compared to a physical mixture of Pt and H-ZSM-5, as the shape-selective properties of H-ZSM-5 inhibit coke formation on the Pt particles. Secondly, the proximity of Pt to the acid sites facilitates a bifunctional catalysis, enabling both dehydrogenation of propane to propene over Pt and oligomerization over the zeolite's acid sites. The Pt catalyst is directly involved in the conversion of propane to methane and ethane under certain conditions, while in others, higher products undergo hydrogenolysis, primarily forming ethane. The constant H/C ratio throughout the reaction indicates efficient use of hydrogen, either for hydrogenation or hydrogenolysis processes.

研究强调了将铂（Pt）与H-ZSM-5沸石结合在丙烷转化为更高碳数化合物中的协同作用。在沸石孔内的Pt颗粒附近，酸性位点的存在显著提高了转化效率。首先，这种配置减少了与物理混合的Pt和H-ZSM-5相比的失活率，因为沸石的形状选择性特性抑制了Pt颗粒上的焦炭形成。其次，Pt靠近酸性位点的布置促进了双功能催化，使丙烷在Pt上脱氢为丙烯，并且在沸石的酸性位点上进行多聚化。在某些条件下，Pt催化剂直接将丙烷转化为甲烷和乙烷，而在其他情况下，较高产物则通过氢解主要形成乙烷。在整个反应过程中保持恒定的H/C比率表明氢的高效利用，既可以用于氢化也可以用于氢解过程。
