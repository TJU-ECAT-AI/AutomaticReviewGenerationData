Propane can be converted to products with more than 3 carbon atoms by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5. Zeolites with Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores lead to better results than physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt; the conversion is higher and almost no deactivation occurs.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The conversion of propane to products with more than 3 carbon atoms is achieved through a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5. Incorporating platinum within the zeolite pores enhances the conversion efficiency significantly compared to physical mixtures of zeolite and supported platinum, with minimal deactivation observed.

通过铂和H-ZSM-5的组合，丙烷可以转化为含有超过3个碳原子的产品。将铂融入到沸石孔中比物理混合物（沸石与支持型铂）能更有效地提高转化率，并且几乎不会出现催化剂失活现象。

The propane conversion consists of two main steps; first dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by an oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite.

<quotes>
It appears that during propane conversion platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms new C-H bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis.
