[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[4] "They observed that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2)."
[5] "As can be seen this reaction is thermodynamically unvaforable."
[6] "The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane."
[7] "This may be due to the fact that the active Pt is situated inside the pores where the shape selective properties of the zeolite prevent coke deposition."
[8] "It appears that during propane conversion platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms net.+ C-H bonds by hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."
[9] "Consequently also low hydrocarbons (methane, ethane), and mainly saturated hydrocarbons are formed."
[10] "Indirectly the obtained results suggest that, most likely due to steric constraints, at higher temperatures propene oligomerizes to linear or singly branched products."

The study investigates the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures over a Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. It is found that the presence of platinum particles within the zeolite pores near the acid sites enhances the conversion efficiency. This is attributed to the shape-selective properties of the zeolite, which prevent coke deposition on the active Pt sites. The conversion process involves two main steps: first, dehydrogenation of propane to propene by platinum, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. At lower temperatures, the main higher hydrocarbon formed is butane. The results suggest that during the propane conversion, platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms net.+ C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the formation of low hydrocarbons and mainly saturated hydrocarbons. The study indirectly indicates that at higher temperatures, propene oligomerizes to linear or singly branched products due to steric constraints.

研究探讨了在适度温度下使用Pt/H-ZSM-5催化剂将丙烷转化为更高碳原子数产物的情况。发现铂颗粒位于沸石孔附近酸性位点内，对转化效率有积极影响。这归因于沸石的选择性形状特性，可防止活性铂位点上焦炭沉积。转化过程包括两个主要步骤：首先，铂催化丙烷脱氢生成丙烯，然后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上发生聚合反应。较低温度下，主要的较高碳原子数产物是丁烷。研究间接表明，在较高温度下，丙烯会聚合成线性或单分支产物，这是由于空间约束导致的。
