[1] "The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane. Firstly the deactivation of the bifunctional catalyst is small compared to the activity decline of a physical mixture of Pt/Si02 and H-ZSM-5. This can be explained by an inhibition of the coke formation on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5."
[2] "The conversion experiments over Pt/Na-ZSM-5 support this assumption."
[3] "The effect of WHSV on the conversion of propane over the 0.4 wt% Pt./H-ZSM-5 catalyst also leads to the conclusion that the mechanism consists of 2 consequetive steps."
[4] "As can be seen in Table I practically no alkenes are formed. Most likely Pt not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane but also the hydrogenation of subsequent formed alkenes."
[5] "Although this hydrogenolysis reaction is unfavorable because it leads to products less valuable than propane, it also has a positive effect because it causes a diminishing of the hydrogen partial pressure and thus will stimulate the propane dehydrogenation."
[6] "The fact that the H/C ratio does not change during reaction implies that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form; the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully used for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."
[7] "We expected that an additional withdrawal of hydrogen from the reaction mixture would drive the dehydrogenation of propane. For this purpose we added 20% oxygen to the feed. However this did not result in a higher conversion."
[8] "We showed that activation of propane is possible by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5. Impregnation of the zeolite with Pt leads to better results than physically mixing with Pt/SiO2. The conversion is much higher and the catalyst shows almost no deactivation."
[9] "The propane conversion consists of two main steps; first dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by an oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite."

1. The Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites inhibit the formation of coke on the Pt particles due to the shape selective properties of H-ZSM-5, leading to a smaller deactivation rate compared to a physical mixture of Pt/SiO2 and H-ZSM-5. This supports the assumption that the Pt/Na-ZSM-5 catalyst also behaves similarly. The mechanism of propane conversion over the 0.4 wt% Pt./H-ZSM-5 catalyst involves two consecutive steps, and the Pt not only catalyzes the dehydrogenation of propane but also hydrogenates the subsequent formed alkenes. This hydrogenolysis reaction, although unfavorable, stimulates the propane dehydrogenation by diminishing the hydrogen partial pressure. There is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form during the reaction, as the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully utilized for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis. Adding 20% oxygen to the feed did not result in a higher conversion. Using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5 leads to higher conversion and almost no deactivation compared to physically mixing with Pt/SiO2. The propane conversion mechanism includes two main steps: dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite.

1. Pt颗粒位于择形沸石分子筛的孔内接近酸性位点附近，由于择形沸石-5的形状选择性特性抑制了Pt颗粒上的焦炭形成，导致与物理混合的Pt/SiO2和H-ZSM-5相比，催化剂失活率较小。这支持了Pt/Na-ZSM-5催化剂也具有类似行为的假设。0.4 wt% Pt./H-ZSM-5催化剂的机制涉及两个连续步骤，并且Pt不仅催化丙烷的脱氢，还催化随后形成的烯烃的氢化。虽然这个氢解反应是不利的，但它通过减少氢分压刺激了丙烷的脱氢。反应过程中没有分子形式的氢损失，因为由丙烯形成的氢完全用于氢化和氢解。向流体中添加20%氧气并未导致更高的转化率。使用铂和择形沸石-5的组合比物理混合的Pt/SiO2导致更高的转化率和几乎无失活。丙烷转化机制包括两个主要步骤：首先由Pt催化丙烷脱氢为丙烯，然后丙烯在择形沸石的酸性位点上发生缩合。
