3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter

Alkali Metal Oxides Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

Transition Metals (Ru and Ni) Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation. Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions and RWGS.

3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods

(N0Mn+)I0 Pathway Driven by Electrostatic Driving Force Dispersion of Cr6+ species and crystallite size are sensitive to pH during the synthesis.

Metal Vapor Synthesis Method The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method enables the co-condensation of metal vapor with the vapor of weakly stabilizing organic ligands during the preparation.

SolGel Method Wang et al. have prepared CrOx-doped mesoporous silica sphere (Cr/MSS) catalysts by one-pot synthesis via a solgel method.

Hydrothermal Method Oliveira et al. have prepared Cr/ZrO2 via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method.

AcidBase Pair The acidbase pair concept is a self-adjusted process that has been widely used to prepare ordered, mesoporous multimetal oxides.

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalysts. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by enhancing selective and stable catalytic performance. Alkali metal oxides, transition metals such as Ru and Ni, and innovative preparation methods including the N0Mn+)I0 pathway, metal vapor synthesis, sol-gel method, hydrothermal method, and acid-base pair approach contribute to overcoming these limitations and improving CO2 activation and oxidation efficiency.
