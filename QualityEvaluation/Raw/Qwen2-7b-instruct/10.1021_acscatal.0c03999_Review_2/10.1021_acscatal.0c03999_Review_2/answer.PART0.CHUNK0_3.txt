3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter: "The addition of O2 in the reactants as a co-feed with CO2 has been initially proposed to overcome these issues, yet the selectivity drops."
3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter: "An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."
3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods: "Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts are crucial in determining the catalytic performance, and can be generally tuned by pH, ligand effect, and surfactant."
3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods: "The as-prepared catalysts present a mesopore structure resembling 3D wormhole-like holes with high surface areas (e.g., 730903 m2 g−1), pore volumes (e.g., 0.711.03 cm3 g−1), and narrow pore size (e.g., 3.94.5 nm)."

Promoters enhance CO2 activation and the oxidizing ability of chromium-based catalysts by facilitating CO2 activation and improving its selective and stable performance. They address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, offering advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by maintaining high selectivity. These additives enable better dispersion and tuning of Cr6+ species in the catalyst, which are crucial for catalytic performance. Specific examples of promoters include alkali metal oxides, transition metals like Ru and Ni, and innovative preparation methods that focus on pH, ligand effect, surfactant use, and the formation of mesoporous structures.
