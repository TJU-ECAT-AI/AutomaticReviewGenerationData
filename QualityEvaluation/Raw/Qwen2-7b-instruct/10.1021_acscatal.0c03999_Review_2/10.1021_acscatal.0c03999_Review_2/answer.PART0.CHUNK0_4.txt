3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter
"CO2 has been proposed to participate in the redox cycles of Cr2+ Cr3+ or Cr3+ Cr6+, however, its oxidation potential is rather weak. Besides, CO2 is quite inert and not easily activated by CrOx."
"An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."
3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods
"Synthetic approaches include (N0Mn+)I0 pathway, metal vapor synthesis method, and solgel method."
"Developed synthetic approaches include hydrothermal methods and acidbase pairs."

Promoters are utilized to enhance the activation of CO2 on chromium-based catalysts, thereby improving their oxidizing capability and ensuring selective and stable performance. Alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding may result in decreased selectivity. Various synthetic methods, such as the (N0Mn+)I0 pathway, metal vapor synthesis, solgel technique, and hydrothermal methods, are employed to tailor the dispersion and types of chromium species in calcined catalysts, which significantly influences the catalytic performance.
