3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter
"Alkali Metal Oxides Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions."
"An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."
3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods
"The as-prepared catalysts present a mesopore structure resembling 3D wormhole-like holes with high surface areas (e.g., 730-903 m2/g), pore volumes (e.g., 0.7-1.03 cm3/g), and narrow pore size (e.g., 3.9-4.5 nm)."

Promoters, including alkali metal oxides and transition metals like Ru and Ni, are utilized to address CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. These additives enhance CO2 activation, improve the catalyst's oxidizing ability, and ensure selective and stable performance. Alternative strategies, such as oxygen co-feeding, often result in decreased selectivity. By contrast, promoters specifically facilitate CO2 activation and boost the catalyst's effectiveness.
