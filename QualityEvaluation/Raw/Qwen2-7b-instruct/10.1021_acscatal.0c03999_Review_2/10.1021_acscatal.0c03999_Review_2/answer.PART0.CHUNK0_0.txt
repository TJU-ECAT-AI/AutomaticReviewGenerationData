3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter
"An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance."

3.1.1.4. Innovation in Preparation Methods
"The as-prepared catalysts present a mesopore structure resembling 3D wormhole-like holes with high surface areas (e.g., 730-903 m2/g), pore volumes (e.g., 0.7-1.03 cm3/g), and narrow pore size (e.g., 3.9-4.5 nm)."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts. They improve the catalyst's oxidizing ability, leading to selective and stable performance. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters offer advantages in enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability without causing a significant decrease in selectivity.

促进剂通过在铬基催化剂上促进二氧化碳活化，解决了二氧化碳氧化电势较弱和惰性的限制。它们提高了催化剂的氧化能力，实现了选择性和稳定性的性能。与O2共供给等替代策略相比，促进剂在增强CO2激活和氧化能力方面提供了优势，同时没有显著降低选择性。
