Promoters, including alkali metal oxides and transition metals like Ru and Ni, are utilized to address CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. These additives enhance CO2 activation, improve the catalyst's oxidizing ability, and ensure selective and stable performance. Alternative strategies, such as oxygen co-feeding, often result in decreased selectivity. By contrast, promoters specifically facilitate CO2 activation and boost the catalyst's effectiveness.

3.1.1.3. Effects of Promoter

Alkali Metal Oxides Because of their basic property, alkali metal oxides have been widely used as promoters for CO2 adsorption and activation in CO2 hydrogenation reactions.

Transition Metals (Ru and Ni) Ru is a potential promoter because of its high activity in CO2 hydrogenation. Ni is also a potential candidate because of its activity in CO2 activation for CO2 reforming reactions and RWGS.

(N0Mn+)I0 Pathway Driven by Electrostatic Driving Force Dispersion of Cr6+ species and crystallite size are sensitive to pH during the synthesis.

Metal Vapor Synthesis Method The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) method enables the co-condensation of metal vapor with the vapor of weakly stabilizing organic ligands during the preparation.

SolGel Method Wang et al. have prepared CrOx-doped mesoporous silica sphere (Cr/MSS) catalysts by one-pot synthesis via a solgel method.

Hydrothermal Method Oliveira et al. have prepared Cr/ZrO2 via a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method.

AcidBase Pair The acidbase pair concept is a self-adjusted process that has been widely used to prepare ordered, mesoporous multimetal oxides.
