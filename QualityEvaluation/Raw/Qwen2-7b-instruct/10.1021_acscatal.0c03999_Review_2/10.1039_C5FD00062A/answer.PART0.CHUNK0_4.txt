[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "To be utilised in this CO2 utilisation reaction The Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG) of each reaction in the modelled, complete reacting system of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 also indicate that further cracking of C3H6 will affect the ultimate yield and selectivity of the final products."
[3] "An increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[4] "Our research, then, looks in detail at the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by CO2 as a potential prospect for CO2 utilisation in temperature and reaction conditions where the ultimate application of solar thermal energy may be a promising technology."
[5] "In reality, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is not a simple single reaction but a multiple reaction system, as shown in Table 2, mainly coupling the traditional dehydrogenation of C3H8 (reaction 1) and reverse water gas shift (reaction 2)."
[6] "The results revealed effective C3H8 conversions at each specified condition while the C3H6 selectivity drops at the beginning of reactions."

The promoters enhance CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability by focusing on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2, especially in the temperature range of 300-500. They specifically address CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by utilizing the dehydrogenation process, which shifts the equilibrium towards the product side, thereby facilitating CO2 utilization. This approach offers advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. The results demonstrate effective C3H8 conversion and a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity, indicating the potential of this CO2 utilization process in the context of solar thermal energy applications.
