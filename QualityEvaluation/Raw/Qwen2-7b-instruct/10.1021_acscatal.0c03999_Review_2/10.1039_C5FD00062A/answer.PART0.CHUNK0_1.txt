[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "The dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is an attractive catalytic route for C3H6 production."
[3] "An increase in the C3H8 partial pressure produced an inhibition of C3H8 conversion but, importantly, a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity."
[4] "However, any proposed CCU process to be realistic for emission reduction potential can only be beneficial if any necessary energy input is from renewable sources."
[5] "We believe that the results presented here are promising in terms of the underpinning catalyst science for establishing the potential industrialisation of the process of CO2 utilisation through C3H8 dehydrogenation."

Promoters enhance CO2 activation and improve oxidizing ability by addressing its weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, primarily focusing on selective and stable catalytic performance. By utilizing CO2 in the presence of C3H8 under solar thermal energy, the promoters enable the dehydrogenation process to occur efficiently within a temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. This process not only converts CO2 into valuable products but also reduces the risk of catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The increase in C3H8 partial pressure leads to an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, thereby promoting a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. This approach aligns with the concept of Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), aiming to shift the focus from disposing of CO2 as an inconvenient by-product to its productive use. For any CCU process to be effective in reducing emissions, the energy input must come from renewable sources. The presented results are promising in terms of establishing the industrialization of CO2 utilization through C3H8 dehydrogenation, offering a sustainable pathway for CO2 conversion into commodity chemicals.

促进剂通过解决二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中的弱氧化潜能和惰性问题，增强了其激活能力并改善了氧化能力。与氧气共供给等替代策略相比，它们主要侧重于选择性和稳定性的催化剂性能。通过在太阳能热能下使用二氧化碳与C3H8，促进剂使脱氢过程在300-500摄氏度的温度范围内高效进行。这一过程不仅将二氧化碳转化为有价值的产物，而且降低了由于焦炭形成导致催化剂失活的风险。增加C3H8分压导致C3H8转化率抑制，从而促进了C3H6选择性的显著增强。这种方法旨在将二氧化碳从不便的副产品转变为可利用的产品，从而改变碳捕获和利用（CCU）的概念焦点。对于任何具有减排潜力的CCU过程而言，能量输入必须来自可再生能源。这里呈现的结果在通过C3H8脱氢建立CO2利用工业化的可能性方面是很有前景的，提供了一条可持续的CO2转换为商品化学品的途径。
