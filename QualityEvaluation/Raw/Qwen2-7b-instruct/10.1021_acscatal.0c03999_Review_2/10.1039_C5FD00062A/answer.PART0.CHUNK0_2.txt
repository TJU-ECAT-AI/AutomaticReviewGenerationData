[1] "Chemical processes aimed at the utilisation and conversion of CO2 are, of course, driven in a thermodynamic sense by the difference in Gibbs Free Energy between the resulting final chemical products, and CO2 and the targeted reactants at the relevant experimental conditions."
[2] "However CO2 being a highly stable molecule will require a substantial amount of energy, effective catalysts and effective reaction conditions for any chemical conversion processes of CO2 into fuels or high-value chemical products."
[3] "If such energy is provided by fossil fuels, the net effect based on any well-to-wheels analysis of the process will invariably result in a net production of CO2; this situation could only be deemed beneficial from a climate mitigation perspective if the necessary input process energy is provided from renewable or sustainable sources."
[4] "Our research, then, looks in detail at the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by CO2 as a potential prospect for CO2 utilisation in temperature and reaction conditions where the ultimate application of solar thermal energy may be a promising technology."
[5] "In reality, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is not a simple single reaction but a multiple reaction system, as shown in Table 2, mainly coupling the traditional dehydrogenation of C3H8 (reaction 1) and reverse water gas shift (reaction 2)."
[6] "CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the equilibrium without increasing the temperature."
[7] "From the aspect of the ultimate application of this particular CO2 utilisation processes, we believe that the enhancement of selectivity of the (target) C3H6 product, whilst sacrificing some of the reactants ultimate conversion is acceptable."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by leveraging CO2's ability to shift the equilibrium of reactions without increasing temperature, as demonstrated by its role as a mild oxidant. This approach offers advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by maintaining stable catalytic performance, enhancing CO2 activation, and achieving selective and stable catalytic outcomes without compromising the efficiency of the overall process. The promotion of CO2 utilization in the context of solar thermal energy aims to facilitate the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemical products, aligning with the pursuit of renewable energy sources for sustainable chemical processes.

促进剂通过利用CO2作为温和氧化剂的能力，来调整反应平衡而不提高温度，来解决CO2在铬基催化剂系统中的弱氧化能力与惰性问题。这种方法相较于氧气共供给等替代策略，在维持催化剂性能稳定性、增强CO2活化以及实现选择性和稳定催化结果的同时，不牺牲过程效率。在太阳能热能的背景下，促进CO2的利用旨在促进CO2转化为有价值的化学产品，与寻求可再生能源来源以实现可持续化学过程的目标相一致。
