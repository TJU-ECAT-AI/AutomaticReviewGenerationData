[1] "In studying the various possibilities to utilise CO2 to convert hydrocarbons using the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy, thermodynamic calculations were carried out for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 using CO2 for the process operating in the temperature range of 300-500."
[2] "An important outcome is the great potential of C3H8 as compared to its lighter and heavier homologues (C2H6 and C4H10, respectively) from both the perspective of CO2 activation and also coking resistance across this temperature range."
[3] "The increase of the overall GHSV can also decrease the C3H8 conversion to the similar extent, but the further cracking of C3H6 cannot be limited."
[4] "The high thermo-stability of the present catalyst makes it attractive to scale-up to a moving bed or even a fluid bed reactor for catalyst regeneration."
[5] "However, one must stress again that any proposed CCU process to be realistic for emission reduction potential can only be beneficial if any necessary energy input is from renewable sources."

1. The promoters enhance CO2 activation, improve its oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance by utilizing the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. They avoid the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by focusing on the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius where CO2 activation is more favorable compared to its lighter and heavier homologues.

2. The advantage of promoting CO2 activation over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding lies in the ability to shift the equilibrium state of the dehydrogenation reaction, thereby enhancing the yield of the desired product, C3H6. This is achieved without the need for additional energy input, making the process more efficient and environmentally friendly.

3. Increasing the overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) decreases the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent as increasing the C3H8 partial pressure, but it does not limit the further cracking of C3H6. This is because the competitive adsorption between the generated C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules strengthens, inhibiting the further cracking effect on C3H6.

4. The present catalyst offers high thermo-stability, which makes it suitable for scaling up to moving bed or fluid bed reactors. This allows for easy catalyst regeneration, ensuring continuous operation and efficiency in the dehydrogenation process.

5. The proposed CO2 utilization process through C3H8 dehydrogenation aims to be realistic for emission reduction potential. However, it is crucial that any energy input for the process comes from renewable sources to ensure that the overall impact on the environment is positive.

1. 促进剂通过利用太阳能热能作为可持续能源，为丙烷脱氢使用二氧化碳，在300-500度的温度范围内对二氧化碳进行活化，从而增强其氧化能力，并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。它们避免了二氧化碳弱氧化潜力和在铬基催化剂系统中惰性的限制，通过专注于与丙烷相比，其更轻和更重的同系物（乙烷和丁烷）在这一温度范围内，二氧化碳激活更加有利的角度。

2. 与氧气共供等替代策略相比，促进二氧化碳活化的优点在于能够改变脱氢反应的平衡状态，从而提高所需产品的产率，即丙烯。这种做法无需额外的能量输入，使过程更加高效且环保。

3. 增加总体气流空间速度（GHSV）可以减少丙烷转化程度，类似于增加丙烷分压的效果，但不能限制丙烯的进一步裂解。这是因为生成的丙烯和失活的丙烷分子之间的竞争吸附作用加强，抑制了进一步裂解丙烯的作用。

4. 现有的催化剂具有高温稳定性，使其适用于移动床或流化床反应器的放大。这使得催化剂容易再生，确保操作连续性和效率的脱氢过程。

5. 通过丙烷脱氢利用二氧化碳的过程旨在实现减排潜力的现实性。然而，确保过程中的能量输入来自可再生能源至关重要，以确保整体环境影响为正。
