Promoters enhance CO2 activation and improve oxidizing ability by addressing its weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, primarily focusing on selective and stable catalytic performance. By utilizing CO2 in the presence of C3H8 under solar thermal energy, the promoters enable the dehydrogenation process to occur efficiently within a temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius. This process not only converts CO2 into valuable products but also reduces the risk of catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. The increase in C3H8 partial pressure leads to an inhibition of C3H8 conversion, thereby promoting a promising enhancement of C3H6 selectivity. This approach aligns with the concept of Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), aiming to shift the focus from disposing of CO2 as an inconvenient by-product to its productive use. For any CCU process to be effective in reducing emissions, the energy input must come from renewable sources. The presented results are promising in terms of establishing the industrialization of CO2 utilization through C3H8 dehydrogenation, offering a sustainable pathway for CO2 conversion into commodity chemicals.

促进剂通过解决二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中的弱氧化潜能和惰性问题，增强了其激活能力并改善了氧化能力。与氧气共供给等替代策略相比，它们主要侧重于选择性和稳定性的催化剂性能。通过在太阳能热能下使用二氧化碳与C3H8，促进剂使脱氢过程在300-500摄氏度的温度范围内高效进行。这一过程不仅将二氧化碳转化为有价值的产物，而且降低了由于焦炭形成导致催化剂失活的风险。增加C3H8分压导致C3H8转化率抑制，从而促进了C3H6选择性的显著增强。这种方法旨在将二氧化碳从不便的副产品转变为可利用的产品，从而改变碳捕获和利用（CCU）的概念焦点。对于任何具有减排潜力的CCU过程而言，能量输入必须来自可再生能源。这里呈现的结果在通过C3H8脱氢建立CO2利用工业化的可能性方面是很有前景的，提供了一条可持续的CO2转换为商品化学品的途径。

[1] "Chemical processes aimed at the utilisation and conversion of CO2 are, of course, driven in a thermodynamic sense by the difference in Gibbs Free Energy between the resulting final chemical products, and CO2 and the targeted reactants at the relevant experimental conditions."
[2] "However CO2 being a highly stable molecule will require a substantial amount of energy, effective catalysts and effective reaction conditions for any chemical conversion processes of CO2 into fuels or high-value chemical products."
[3] "If such energy is provided by fossil fuels, the net effect based on any well-to-wheels analysis of the process will invariably result in a net production of CO2; this situation could only be deemed beneficial from a climate mitigation perspective if the necessary input process energy is provided from renewable or sustainable sources."
[4] "Our research, then, looks in detail at the thermodynamics of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by CO2 as a potential prospect for CO2 utilisation in temperature and reaction conditions where the ultimate application of solar thermal energy may be a promising technology."
[5] "In reality, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 is not a simple single reaction but a multiple reaction system, as shown in Table 2, mainly coupling the traditional dehydrogenation of C3H8 (reaction 1) and reverse water gas shift (reaction 2)."
[6] "CO2, as a mild oxidant, is not favoured to gasify the formed carbon deposition. Hence, CO2 is always applied in order to shift the equilibrium without increasing the temperature."
[7] "From the aspect of the ultimate application of this particular CO2 utilisation processes, we believe that the enhancement of selectivity of the (target) C3H6 product, whilst sacrificing some of the reactants ultimate conversion is acceptable."

1. The promoters enhance CO2 activation, improve its oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance by utilizing the sustainable energy source of solar thermal energy for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. They avoid the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by focusing on the temperature range of 300-500 degrees Celsius where CO2 activation is more favorable compared to its lighter and heavier homologues.

2. The advantage of promoting CO2 activation over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding lies in the ability to shift the equilibrium state of the dehydrogenation reaction, thereby enhancing the yield of the desired product, C3H6. This is achieved without the need for additional energy input, making the process more efficient and environmentally friendly.

3. Increasing the overall gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) decreases the C3H8 conversion to a similar extent as increasing the C3H8 partial pressure, but it does not limit the further cracking of C3H6. This is because the competitive adsorption between the generated C3H6 and inactivated C3H8 molecules strengthens, inhibiting the further cracking effect on C3H6.

4. The present catalyst offers high thermo-stability, which makes it suitable for scaling up to moving bed or fluid bed reactors. This allows for easy catalyst regeneration, ensuring continuous operation and efficiency in the dehydrogenation process.

5. The proposed CO2 utilization process through C3H8 dehydrogenation aims to be realistic for emission reduction potential. However, it is crucial that any energy input for the process comes from renewable sources to ensure that the overall impact on the environment is positive.

1. 促进剂通过利用太阳能热能作为可持续能源，为丙烷脱氢使用二氧化碳，在300-500度的温度范围内对二氧化碳进行活化，从而增强其氧化能力，并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。它们避免了二氧化碳弱氧化潜力和在铬基催化剂系统中惰性的限制，通过专注于与丙烷相比，其更轻和更重的同系物（乙烷和丁烷）在这一温度范围内，二氧化碳激活更加有利的角度。

2. 与氧气共供等替代策略相比，促进二氧化碳活化的优点在于能够改变脱氢反应的平衡状态，从而提高所需产品的产率，即丙烯。这种做法无需额外的能量输入，使过程更加高效且环保。

3. 增加总体气流空间速度（GHSV）可以减少丙烷转化程度，类似于增加丙烷分压的效果，但不能限制丙烯的进一步裂解。这是因为生成的丙烯和失活的丙烷分子之间的竞争吸附作用加强，抑制了进一步裂解丙烯的作用。

4. 现有的催化剂具有高温稳定性，使其适用于移动床或流化床反应器的放大。这使得催化剂容易再生，确保操作连续性和效率的脱氢过程。

5. 通过丙烷脱氢利用二氧化碳的过程旨在实现减排潜力的现实性。然而，确保过程中的能量输入来自可再生能源至关重要，以确保整体环境影响为正。
