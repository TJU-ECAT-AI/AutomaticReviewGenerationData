[1] "In an attempt to ameliorate the burgeoning growth in greenhouse gas emissions, there are currently intense efforts,world-wide, aimed at the utilisation of CO2, particularly in its conversion to fuels and high-value chemical products1,2,3,4,5,6,7."
[2] "However CO2 being a highly stable molecule will require a substantial amount of energy, effective catalysts and effective reaction conditions for any chemical conversion processes of CO2 into fuels or high-value chemical products."
[3] "Utilising solar thermal energy at these lower temperatures for thermochemical processes than the widely-utilised High Temperature Process regime9 (T1000) creates highly interesting and important challenges for catalysis science."
[4] "As an improved reaction of the dehydrogenation of C3H8, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 ( ) has been heavily studied over the last decade."
[5] "The advantages of specifically selecting C3H8 as the feedstock for CO2 utilisation are advanced for the  lower temperature requirements, as compared to both its lighter and heavier alkane homologues, C2H6 and C4H10, respectively."
[6] "The shift of the equilibrium state by CO2 in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 has been identified from a thermodynamic analysis."
[7] "In this paper, the thermodynamic analysis was operated across a more comprehensive reaction system which covered all the possible by-products together with the generation of carbon."
[8] "The thermodynamic advantages of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 are recognisably the best alkane to be targeted for a chemical utilisation process for CO2 operating in this temperature range."
