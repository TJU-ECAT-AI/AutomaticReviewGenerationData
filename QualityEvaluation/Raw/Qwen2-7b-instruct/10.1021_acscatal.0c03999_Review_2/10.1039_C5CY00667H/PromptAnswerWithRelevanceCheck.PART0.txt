The document investigates the impact of nickel particle size on the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 and the reverse water gas shift reactions on Ni/SiO2 catalysts. It shows that the kinetic parameters, formation pathways of CO and CH4, and reaction selectivity are significantly influenced by the particle size of nickel. At a low loading of 0.5 wt%, the catalyst demonstrates higher activity in CO2 hydrogenation with a preference for CO formation. Increasing the nickel loading to 10 wt% leads to a switch in selectivity, favoring the formation of CH4. The consecutive pathway, favored on small Ni particles, is associated with low hydrogen coverage on the Ni surface, resulting in CO formation and high CO selectivity. The primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are proposed to be the kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

The document explores the impact of nickel particle size on the catalytic properties of Ni/SiO2 catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation. It reveals that the particle size significantly influences the kinetic parameters, formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity. Smaller Ni particles favor CO formation due to their high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, whereas larger particles promote CH4 formation. The study identifies the formate species in a monodentate configuration as being intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation across both catalyst types, regardless of particle size. The reaction pathways are proposed to be consecutive for small Ni clusters, leading to CO formation, while on larger particles, a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway may occur, affecting the selectivity and kinetic parameters. Sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are suggested as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation.

本文研究了镍颗粒大小对Ni/SiO2催化剂在CO2氢化中的催化性能的影响。它揭示了颗粒大小显著影响动力学参数、CO和CH4的形成路径以及反应选择性。较小的Ni颗粒有利于CO的形成，因为它们在CO2氢化中具有高活性，而较大的颗粒则促进CH4的形成。研究发现，在两种催化剂类型中，无论颗粒大小如何，都涉及形式酸物种在单齿配置中的复杂作用。对于小Ni簇，推测连续反应途径占主导地位，导致CO的形成，而在较大颗粒上，可能混合有连续和平行途径，这影响了选择性和动力学参数。建议表面对应于尖点、角或台阶位置的站点作为CO2氢化的主要活性位点。

The study highlights the significant impact of nickel particle size on the catalytic properties of Ni/SiO2 catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation. At a low Ni loading of 0.5 wt%, the catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation compared to a 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst. This is attributed to the influence of nickel particle size on kinetic parameters, CO and CH4 formation pathways, and reaction selectivity. Specifically, the consecutive pathway, favored on small Ni particles, results in high CO selectivity due to low hydrogen coverage on the Ni surface leading to CO formation from formate intermediates. Conversely, when the Ni loading increases to 10 wt% (around 9 nm particles), the catalyst shifts towards favoring CH4 formation. This change in behavior is attributed to a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway, where the m-HCOO intermediate can undergo competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4. The larger Ni particles enable a higher hydrogen coverage, facilitating the parallel pathway. The active sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation.

研究强调了镍颗粒大小对Ni/SiO2催化剂在CO2氢化中的催化性质的重要影响。在低镍负载（0.5 wt%）下，催化剂在CO2氢化中的催化活性比10 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂高。这归因于镍颗粒大小对动力学参数、CO和CH4形成途径以及反应选择性的影响。具体来说，在小镍颗粒上占优势的连续途径导致高CO选择性，这是由于Ni表面低氢覆盖率导致从形式酸中间体生成CO。相反，当镍负载增加到10 wt%（约9 nm颗粒）时，催化剂倾向于促进CH4形成。这种行为的变化归因于混合连续和平行途径，其中m-HCOO中间体可以经历CO的竞争性分解或氢化为CH4。更大的Ni颗粒使得更高的氢覆盖，促进了平行途径。提出在Ni/SiO2表面上对应于尖点、角落或台阶位置的位点作为CO2氢化的主要活性位点。

The consecutive pathway, which is favored on small Ni particles, is attributed to low H2 coverage on the Ni surface, leading to dissociation of formate intermediates resulting in CO formation and high CO selectivity.
The reaction of CO2 hydrogenation on large Ni particles may be controlled by mixed consecutive and parallel pathways, providing the likelihood that the formate intermediate is competitively hydrogenated to CO or CH4 as part of a parallel reaction pathway.

The consecutive pathway, preferred on small Ni particles, results from low hydrogen coverage on the Ni surface, causing the dissociation of formate intermediates leading to CO formation and high CO selectivity. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction on large Ni particles may be governed by a combination of consecutive and parallel pathways, suggesting that the formate intermediate is competitively hydrogenated to CO or CH4 as part of a parallel pathway.

The promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by focusing on Ni/SiO2 catalysts with distinct nickel particle sizes. The 0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates higher activity for CO2 hydrogenation, producing CO and CH4, due to the smaller particle size facilitating a consecutive pathway that quickly forms CO from the m-HCOO intermediate. Conversely, the 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst enhances CH4 formation through a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway, with the larger particle size promoting stronger H2 adsorption and hydrogenation of the m-HCOO intermediate to CH4. This strategy offers specific advantages over alternative methods like O2 co-feeding by optimizing the kinetic parameters, reaction pathways, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance for CO2 activation and oxidation.

促剂通过专注于不同镍颗粒大小的Ni/SiO2催化剂，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化电势和惰性在铬基催化系统中的限制。0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂通过较小的颗粒尺寸提高了CO2氢化活性，生成CO和CH4，采用连续途径快速从m-HCOO中间体形成CO。相比之下，10 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂通过混合连续和平行途径促进CH4生成，大颗粒尺寸增强H2吸附，使m-HCOO中间体氢化到CH4的可能性增加。与O2共供氧等替代策略相比，这种方法在优化动力学参数、反应途径以及实现CO2活化和氧化的有选择性和稳定的催化性能方面具有特定优势。
