Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been studied on both 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts with particular focus on the production of CO and CH4.
The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity.

At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity.
With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation.

At a low nickel loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst exhibits high catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with a strong preference for CO production. When the nickel loading increases to 10 wt% (approximately 9 nm particles), the selectivity shifts towards CH4 formation.

The consecutive pathway, which is favored on small Ni particles, is attributed to low H2 coverage on the Ni surface, leading to dissociation of formate intermediates resulting in CO formation and high CO selectivity.
The reaction of CO2 hydrogenation on large Ni particles may be controlled by mixed consecutive and parallel pathways, providing the likelihood that the formate intermediate is competitively hydrogenated to CO or CH4 as part of a parallel reaction pathway.

The consecutive pathway, preferred on small Ni particles, results from low hydrogen coverage on the Ni surface, causing the dissociation of formate intermediates leading to CO formation and high CO selectivity. The CO2 hydrogenation reaction on large Ni particles may be governed by a combination of consecutive and parallel pathways, suggesting that the formate intermediate is competitively hydrogenated to CO or CH4 as part of a parallel pathway.

连续路径，在小Ni粒子上被偏好，归因于Ni表面的低氢覆盖，导致形酸中间体的分解产生CO并获得高CO选择性。大Ni粒子上的CO2氢化反应可能由连续和平行路径的混合控制，暗示形酸中间体作为并行路径的一部分，被竞争性氢化为CO或CH4。
