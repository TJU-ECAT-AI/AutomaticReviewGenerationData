[1] "Catalytic CO2 hydrogenation has been studied on both 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalysts with particular focus on the production of CO and CH4. The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
[2] "The 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst provided better catalytic activity in terms of CH4 formation than the 0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst."
[3] "On the 9 nm Ni particles (10 wt% Ni/SiO2), in situ FT-IR studies revealed that the m-HCOO intermediate may form from co-adsorbed H2 and CO2 (Fig. 8)."
[4] "The 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 material may provide stronger H2 adsorption, leading to enhancement of H2 coverage and in the likelihood of hydrogenation of the m-HCOO intermediate to CH4."

The promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by focusing on Ni/SiO2 catalysts with distinct nickel particle sizes. The 0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates higher activity for CO2 hydrogenation, producing CO and CH4, due to the smaller particle size facilitating a consecutive pathway that quickly forms CO from the m-HCOO intermediate. Conversely, the 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst enhances CH4 formation through a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway, with the larger particle size promoting stronger H2 adsorption and hydrogenation of the m-HCOO intermediate to CH4. This strategy offers specific advantages over alternative methods like O2 co-feeding by optimizing the kinetic parameters, reaction pathways, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance for CO2 activation and oxidation.

促剂通过专注于不同镍颗粒大小的Ni/SiO2催化剂，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化电势和惰性在铬基催化系统中的限制。0.5 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂通过较小的颗粒尺寸提高了CO2氢化活性，生成CO和CH4，采用连续途径快速从m-HCOO中间体形成CO。相比之下，10 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂通过混合连续和平行途径促进CH4生成，大颗粒尺寸增强H2吸附，使m-HCOO中间体氢化到CH4的可能性增加。与O2共供氧等替代策略相比，这种方法在优化动力学参数、反应途径以及实现CO2活化和氧化的有选择性和稳定的催化性能方面具有特定优势。
