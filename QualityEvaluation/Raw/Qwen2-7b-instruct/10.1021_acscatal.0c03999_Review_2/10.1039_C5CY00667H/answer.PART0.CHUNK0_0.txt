[1] "The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
[2] "At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst shows a comparatively higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation with high CO selectivity."
[3] "With Ni loading increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity is switched to favor CH4 formation."
[4] "The consecutive pathway, which is favored on small Ni particles, is attributed to low H2 coverage on the Ni surface, leading to dissociation of formate intermediates resulting in CO formation and high CO selectivity."
[5] "The sites corresponding to kink, corner or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation."

The document investigates the impact of nickel particle size on the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 and the reverse water gas shift reactions on Ni/SiO2 catalysts. It shows that the kinetic parameters, formation pathways of CO and CH4, and reaction selectivity are significantly influenced by the particle size of nickel. At a low loading of 0.5 wt%, the catalyst demonstrates higher activity in CO2 hydrogenation with a preference for CO formation. Increasing the nickel loading to 10 wt% leads to a switch in selectivity, favoring the formation of CH4. The consecutive pathway, favored on small Ni particles, is associated with low hydrogen coverage on the Ni surface, resulting in CO formation and high CO selectivity. The primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation are proposed to be the kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface.

该文献研究了镍粒子尺寸对CO2催化氢化和Ni/SiO2催化剂上逆水煤气变换反应的影响。它表明，催化剂的动力学参数、CO和CH4的形成途径以及反应选择性受到镍粒子尺寸的显著影响。在0.5 wt%的低负载下，催化剂在CO2氢化中表现出较高的活性，并倾向于CO形成。将镍负载增加到10 wt%，导致选择性转向有利于CH4形成。在小Ni颗粒上占优势的连续路径与Ni表面较低的氢覆盖率相关联，导致CO形成和高CO选择性。提出的主要活性位点是Ni/SiO2表面上的尖端、角落或台阶位置。
