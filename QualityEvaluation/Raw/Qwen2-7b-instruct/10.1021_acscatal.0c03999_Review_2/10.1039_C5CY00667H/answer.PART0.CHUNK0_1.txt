The document explores the impact of nickel particle size on the catalytic properties of Ni/SiO2 catalysts during CO2 hydrogenation. It reveals that the particle size significantly influences the kinetic parameters, formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity. Smaller Ni particles favor CO formation due to their high activity in CO2 hydrogenation, whereas larger particles promote CH4 formation. The study identifies the formate species in a monodentate configuration as being intricately involved in CO2 hydrogenation across both catalyst types, regardless of particle size. The reaction pathways are proposed to be consecutive for small Ni clusters, leading to CO formation, while on larger particles, a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway may occur, affecting the selectivity and kinetic parameters. Sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are suggested as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation.

本文研究了镍颗粒大小对Ni/SiO2催化剂在CO2氢化中的催化性能的影响。它揭示了颗粒大小显著影响动力学参数、CO和CH4的形成路径以及反应选择性。较小的Ni颗粒有利于CO的形成，因为它们在CO2氢化中具有高活性，而较大的颗粒则促进CH4的形成。研究发现，在两种催化剂类型中，无论颗粒大小如何，都涉及形式酸物种在单齿配置中的复杂作用。对于小Ni簇，推测连续反应途径占主导地位，导致CO的形成，而在较大颗粒上，可能混合有连续和平行途径，这影响了选择性和动力学参数。建议表面对应于尖点、角或台阶位置的站点作为CO2氢化的主要活性位点。
