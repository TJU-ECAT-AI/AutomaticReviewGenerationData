[1] "At low Ni loading (0.5 wt%), the catalyst provided higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation than the 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst."
[2] "The large difference in Ni particle size between the 0.5 wt% and 10 wt% Ni loadings strongly affects the kinetic parameters of CO2 hydrogenation, the formation pathways of CO and CH4, and the reaction selectivity."
[3] "The consecutive pathway, which is favored on small Ni particles, is attributed to low H2 coverage on the Ni surface, leading to dissociation of formate intermediates resulting in CO formation and high CO selectivity."
[4] "When the Ni loading was increased to 10 wt% (ca. 9 nm particles), the selectivity switched to favor CH4 formation, and the reaction proceeds through the mixed consecutive and parallel pathways."

The study highlights the significant impact of nickel particle size on the catalytic properties of Ni/SiO2 catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation. At a low Ni loading of 0.5 wt%, the catalyst demonstrates a higher catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation compared to a 10 wt% Ni/SiO2 catalyst. This is attributed to the influence of nickel particle size on kinetic parameters, CO and CH4 formation pathways, and reaction selectivity. Specifically, the consecutive pathway, favored on small Ni particles, results in high CO selectivity due to low hydrogen coverage on the Ni surface leading to CO formation from formate intermediates. Conversely, when the Ni loading increases to 10 wt% (around 9 nm particles), the catalyst shifts towards favoring CH4 formation. This change in behavior is attributed to a mixed consecutive and parallel pathway, where the m-HCOO intermediate can undergo competitive dissociation to CO or hydrogenation to CH4. The larger Ni particles enable a higher hydrogen coverage, facilitating the parallel pathway. The active sites corresponding to kink, corner, or step positions on the Ni/SiO2 surface are proposed as the primary active sites for CO2 hydrogenation.

研究强调了镍颗粒大小对Ni/SiO2催化剂在CO2氢化中的催化性质的重要影响。在低镍负载（0.5 wt%）下，催化剂在CO2氢化中的催化活性比10 wt% Ni/SiO2催化剂高。这归因于镍颗粒大小对动力学参数、CO和CH4形成途径以及反应选择性的影响。具体来说，在小镍颗粒上占优势的连续途径导致高CO选择性，这是由于Ni表面低氢覆盖率导致从形式酸中间体生成CO。相反，当镍负载增加到10 wt%（约9 nm颗粒）时，催化剂倾向于促进CH4形成。这种行为的变化归因于混合连续和平行途径，其中m-HCOO中间体可以经历CO的竞争性分解或氢化为CH4。更大的Ni颗粒使得更高的氢覆盖，促进了平行途径。提出在Ni/SiO2表面上对应于尖点、角落或台阶位置的位点作为CO2氢化的主要活性位点。
