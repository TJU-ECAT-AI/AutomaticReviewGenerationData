[1] "Our general acidbase pairprinciples for rational combinations of inorganic precursors are depicted in Fig. 1a. Various metallic and non- metallic sources are sorted according to their relative acidity and alkalinity on solvation (see detailed classification by dissociation constant Kin Supplementary Information)."
[2] "In the selection of possible pair combinations, normally the larger the acidity or alkalinity difference between the metallic and/or non-metallic sources, the more effectively the pairs will form and function."
[3] "We show that the highly ordered mesostructured metal phosphates can be moulded into morphologies ofchoice, and that they show interesting physicochemical properties."
[4] "Using acidbase pair chemistry, we have synthesized various mesoscopically ordered, large-pore, homogeneous and stable metal Self-adjusted synthesis of ordered stable mesoporous minerals by acidbase pairs"

The promoters utilize the principles of acid-base pair chemistry to rationally combine inorganic precursors. They sort metallic and non-metallic sources based on their solvation acidity and alkalinity, aiming to select pairs with a significant difference in acidity or alkalinity for optimal synthesis. This approach allows for the creation of highly ordered, large-pored, stable, and homogenous metal-based mesoporous materials with customizable morphologies and interesting physical and chemical properties.
