[1] "Although the chemical diversity of ordered composite meso- porous materials has been expanding during the past decade113,progress has been limited by the need for a general synthetic approach that is predictive and makes use ofwell developed fundamen- tal chemical principles."
[2] "Researchers have previously used the interaction of organicinorganic (OI) species that are present during the nucleation of the composite phase, and several synthesis pathways,such as direct surfactantinorganic interaction (S+I, SI+, S0I0) and mediated interaction (S+XI+,SX+I),have been proposed2,3."
[3] "We propose several new routes and demonstrate their versatility and validity through the successful syntheses of a wide variety of highly ordered, large-pore,homogeneous,stable and multicomponent mesostructured minerals,including metal phosphates and metal borates,as well as various metal oxides and mixed metal oxides."
[4] "We show that the highly ordered mesostructured metal phosphates can be moulded into morphologies ofchoice,and that they show interesting physicochemical properties."
[5] "Our general acidbase pairprinciples for rational combinations of inorganic precursors are depicted in Fig. 1a."
[6] "This new acidbase pair concept is particularly important for the preparation of multicomponent mesoporous materials."
[7] "For example, ordered mesoporous titanium phosphate (TiPO) can be obtained by carefully selecting appropriate acidbase pair precursors (see Fig. 1b and Supplementary Information)."
[8] "The aforementioned phosphates have at least five distinct merits (see details in Supplementary Information) from the structural point of view."
[9] "We associate this with the new concept of using non-aqueous acidbase pairs for choosing inorganic species that will fully interact under the self-adjusted conditions, giving much thicker inorganic walls (generally above 3 nm) that are homogeneous and more robust."
[10] "These ordered, large-pore, stable mesoporous minerals have properties ofinterest for numerous potentially valuable applications."
