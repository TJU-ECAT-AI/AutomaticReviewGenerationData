[1] "Researchers have previously used the interaction of organicinorganic (OI) species that are present during the nucleation of the composite phase, and several synthesis pathways,such as direct surfactantinorganic interaction (S+I, SI+, S0I0) and mediated interaction (S+XI+,SX+I),have been proposed."
[2] "We propose several new routes and demonstrate their versatility and validity through the successful syntheses of a wide variety of highly ordered, large-pore,homogeneous,stable and multicomponent mesostructured minerals,including metal phosphates and metal borates,as well as various metal oxides and mixed metal oxides."
[3] "Examples are alkoxides (esters) and anhydrous chlorides (such as Ti(OCH2CH3)4 + PCl3)."
[4] "These ordered, large-pore, stable mesoporous minerals have properties ofinterest for numerous potentially valuable applications."

The researchers have utilized the interaction of organicinorganic (OI) species during the nucleation of the composite phase to propose several synthesis pathways, such as direct surfactantinorganic interaction (S+I, SI+, S0I0) and mediated interaction (S+XI+,SX+I). They have introduced new routes for synthesis and successfully created a diverse range of highly ordered, large-pore, homogeneous, stable, and multicomponent mesostructured minerals, including metal phosphates, metal borates, metal oxides, and mixed metal oxides. Examples of these inorganic precursors include alkoxides (esters) and anhydrous chlorides (like Ti(OCH2CH3)4 + PCl3). These materials exhibit promising properties for various potential applications.
