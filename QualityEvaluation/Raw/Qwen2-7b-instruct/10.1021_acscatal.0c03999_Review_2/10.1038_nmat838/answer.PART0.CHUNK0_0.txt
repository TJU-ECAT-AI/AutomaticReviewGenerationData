[1] "Although the chemical diversity of ordered composite meso- porous materials has been expanding during the past decade113,progress has been limited by the need for a general synthetic approach that is predictive and makes use ofwell developed fundamen- tal chemical principles."
[2] "Researchers have previously used the interaction of organicinorganic (OI) species that are present during the nucleation of the composite phase, and several synthesis pathways,such as direct surfactantinorganic interaction (S+I, SI+, S0I0) and mediated interaction (S+XI+,SX+I),have been proposed2,3."
[3] "We propose several new routes and demonstrate their versatility and validity through the successful syntheses of a wide variety of highly ordered, large-pore,homogeneous,stable and multicomponent mesostructured minerals,including metal phosphates and metal borates,as well as various metal oxides and mixed metal oxides."
[4] "We show that the highly ordered mesostructured metal phosphates can be moulded into morphologies ofchoice,and that they show interesting physicochemical properties."
[5] "Our general acidbase pairprinciples for rational combinations of inorganic precursors are depicted in Fig. 1a."
[6] "This new acidbase pair concept is particularly important for the preparation of multicomponent mesoporous materials."
[7] "For example, ordered mesoporous titanium phosphate (TiPO) can be obtained by carefully selecting appropriate acidbase pair precursors (see Fig. 1b and Supplementary Information)."
[8] "The aforementioned phosphates have at least five distinct merits (see details in Supplementary Information) from the structural point of view."
[9] "We associate this with the new concept of using non-aqueous acidbase pairs for choosing inorganic species that will fully interact under the self-adjusted conditions, giving much thicker inorganic walls (generally above 3 nm) that are homogeneous and more robust."
[10] "These ordered, large-pore, stable mesoporous minerals have properties ofinterest for numerous potentially valuable applications."

The document does not provide information on how promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, nor does it compare the specific advantages of these promoters to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

文档没有提供关于如何通过促进剂解决二氧化碳弱氧化电位和惰性在铬基催化剂系统中的限制的信息，也没有比较这些促进剂相对于替代策略（如氧气共供氧）在提高二氧化碳活化、增强氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能方面的具体优势。
