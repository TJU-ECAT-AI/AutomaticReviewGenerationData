[1] "Researchers have previously used the interaction of organicinorganic (OI) species that are present during the nucleation of the composite phase, and several synthesis pathways,such as direct surfactantinorganic interaction (S+I, SI+, S0I0) and mediated interaction (S+XI+,SX+I),have been proposed."
[2] "We propose several new routes and demonstrate their versatility and validity through the successful syntheses of a wide variety of highly ordered, large-pore,homogeneous,stable and multicomponent mesostructured minerals,including metal phosphates and metal borates,as well as various metal oxides and mixed metal oxides."
[3] "Our general acidbase pairprinciples for rational combinations of inorganic precursors are depicted in Fig. 1a."
[4] "This new acidbase pair concept is particularly important for the preparation of multicomponent mesoporous materials."
[5] "For example, ordered mesoporous titanium phosphate (TiPO) can be obtained by carefully selecting appropriate acidbase pair precursors (see Fig. 1b and Supplementary Information)."
[6] "Using acidbase pair chemistry, we have synthesized various mesoscopically ordered, large-pore, homogeneous and stable metal Self-adjusted synthesis of ordered stable mesoporous minerals by acidbase pairs."
[7] "The aforementioned phosphates have at least five distinct merits (see details in Supplementary Information) from the structural point of view."
[8] "The metal/phosphorus ratios of the samples can be easily tuned by changing the initial composition of the mother liquor."
[9] "Large-pore mesoporous metal phosphates have not been reported previously because triblock copolymers have rarely been used in the syntheses of metal phosphates, whereas ionic surfactants or amines (smaller molecular size) have been commonly used."
[10] "These ordered, large-pore, stable mesoporous minerals have properties ofinterest for numerous potentially valuable applications."
