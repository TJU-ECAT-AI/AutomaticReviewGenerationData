[1] "Recently, there has been a great deal of attention on the use of metal nanoparticles as valuable catalysts [1]. Their catalytic properties are strongly related to the particle size and recent findings on their size-dependent chemistry has added a new dimension to the subject [2]. However, stabilizers are usually used to avoid agglomeration to bulk metal and the kind of stabilizer can also strongly affect their catalytic behaviour [3]."
[2] "We have studied the activity of catalysts prepared from arene-solvated Rh atoms, containing trioctylamine (TOA) as additional stabilizer. Such systems are excellent starting materials for the preparation of new supported catalysts largely more active and selective than analogous samples commercially available or similarly prepared in the absence of TOA."
[3] "HRTEM measurements, IR studies on adsorbed CO species and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses evidenced the role of TOA in controlling the particle growth in the preparative process and in stabilizing the resulting Rh particles against erosion by CO and oxidation."

The literature demonstrates that the use of promoters, specifically trioctylamine (TOA), addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by stabilizing the metal nanoparticles and controlling their growth during preparation. This leads to enhanced CO2 activation, improved oxidizing ability, and selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, the use of promoters offers a more effective way to enhance CO2 activation and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance.

文献表明，通过使用促进剂，特别是三辛基胺（TOA），可以解决二氧化碳弱氧化电位和惰性在铬基催化剂系统中的局限性。这通过稳定金属纳米颗粒并控制其制备过程中的生长来实现。这导致了CO2激活的增强、氧化能力的提高以及选择性和稳定的催化性能。与共给氧等替代策略相比，使用促进剂提供了一种更有效的方法来增强CO2激活并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。
