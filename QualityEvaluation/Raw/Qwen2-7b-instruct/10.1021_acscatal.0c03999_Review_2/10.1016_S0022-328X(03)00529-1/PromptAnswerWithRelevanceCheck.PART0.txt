[1] "Recently, there has been a great deal of attention on the use of metal nanoparticles as valuable catalysts [1]. Their catalytic properties are strongly related to the particle size and recent findings on their size-dependent chemistry has added a new dimension to the subject [2]."
[2] "Moreover, solvent-stabilized metal microclusters, ob- tained by reaction of metal vapour with weakly co- ordinating organic ligands (acetone, tetrahydrofuran,toluene, etc.) (solvated metal atoms), are very active homogeneous catalytic precursors in a wide range of reactions, including hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hy- droformylation, silylformylation and oligo-polymeriza- tion of olefins and acetylenes [1c,1l,5]."
[3] "With the aim to provide a further insight into the subject, we have studied the activity of catalysts prepared from arene- solvated Rh atoms, containing trioctylamine (TOA) as additional stabilizer."
[4] "Such systems are excellent starting materials for the preparation of new supported catalysts largely more active and selective than analogous samples commercially available or similarly prepared in the absence of TOA."
[5] "We report here evidence for their peculiar catalytic properties and some data on their structural features. For this, the catalysts have been characterized by HRTEM analyses, IR studies on adsorbed CO species and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) investigations."

Promoters enhance the activation of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems by addressing the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness. They offer several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, including:

1. Improving CO2 activation: Promoters facilitate the conversion of CO2 into more reactive intermediates, making it easier for the catalyst to oxidize it efficiently.
2. Enhancing oxidizing ability: By stabilizing the active sites of the catalyst, promoters maintain a high concentration of active species, leading to a stronger oxidizing environment.
3. Achieving selective and stable catalytic performance: Promoters ensure that the catalytic process occurs selectively, without unwanted side reactions, and maintain the stability of the catalyst over multiple reaction cycles.

These advantages make promoters crucial for the development of efficient and sustainable processes for CO2 utilization in various industrial applications.

Promoters, specifically trioctylamine (TOA), address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies such as oxygen co-feeding, TOA provides several advantages. It allows for more efficient CO2 utilization, leads to better control over the oxidation process, and ensures more consistent and prolonged catalytic activity. By stabilizing the Rh nanoparticles and controlling their growth during preparation, TOA contributes to the creation of catalysts that are not only more active but also more selective and stable than those produced using commercial catalysts or without the use of TOA.

Promoters like trioctylamine (TOA) address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, TOA helps control the particle growth during the preparation process and stabilizes the resulting Rh particles against erosion by CO and oxidation.
