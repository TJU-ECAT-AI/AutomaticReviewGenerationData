[1] "Recently, there has been a great deal of attention on the use of metal nanoparticles as valuable catalysts [1]."
[2] "Their catalytic properties are strongly related to the particle size and recent findings on their size-dependent chemistry has added a new dimension to the subject [2]."
[3] "However, stabilizers are usually used to avoid agglomeration to bulk metal and the kind of stabilizer can also strongly affect their catalytic behaviour [3]."
[4] "Strong interacting ligands, like tetraalkylammonium halides, poly-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1,10-phenantroline, have been found to restrict the catalytic activity [1j]."
[5] "While hydroxyalkyl ammonium salts or aliphatic amines with long alkyl groups (C8 or higher) have been reported to greatly improve the efficiency of the catalytic precursor [1i,4]."
[6] "Moreover, solvent-stabilized metal microclusters, obtained by reaction of metal vapour with weakly coordinating organic ligands (acetone, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc.) (solvated metal atoms), are very active homogeneous catalytic precursors in a wide range of reactions."
[7] "With the aim to provide a further insight into the subject, we have studied the activity of catalysts prepared from arene-solvated Rh atoms, containing trioctylamine (TOA) as additional stabilizer."
[8] "Such systems are excellent starting materials for the preparation of new supported catalysts largely more active and selective than analogous samples commercially available or similarly prepared in the absence of TOA."
[9] "We report here evidence for their peculiar catalytic properties and some data on their structural features."
[10] "For this, the catalysts have been characterized by HRTEM analyses, IR studies on adsorbed CO species and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) investigations."

The document discusses the use of metal nanoparticles as catalysts, emphasizing the impact of particle size, stabilizers, and ligands on their catalytic properties. It specifically examines the role of trioctylamine (TOA) as a stabilizer in the preparation of supported rhodium catalysts, which exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity compared to commercial catalysts or those prepared without TOA. The study uses various characterization techniques to investigate the structural features and catalytic performance of these rhodium systems.
