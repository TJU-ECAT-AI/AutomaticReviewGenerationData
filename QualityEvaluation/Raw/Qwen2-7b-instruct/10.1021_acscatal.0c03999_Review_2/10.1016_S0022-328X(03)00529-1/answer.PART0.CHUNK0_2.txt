[1] "Recently, there has been a great deal of attention on the use of metal nanoparticles as valuable catalysts [1]. Their catalytic properties are strongly related to the particle size and recent findings on their size-dependent chemistry has added a new dimension to the subject [2]."
[2] "Moreover, solvent-stabilized metal microclusters, ob- tained by reaction of metal vapour with weakly co- ordinating organic ligands (acetone, tetrahydrofuran,toluene, etc.) (solvated metal atoms), are very active homogeneous catalytic precursors in a wide range of reactions, including hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hy- droformylation, silylformylation and oligo-polymeriza- tion of olefins and acetylenes [1c,1l,5]."
[3] "With the aim to provide a further insight into the subject, we have studied the activity of catalysts prepared from arene- solvated Rh atoms, containing trioctylamine (TOA) as additional stabilizer."
[4] "Such systems are excellent starting materials for the preparation of new supported catalysts largely more active and selective than analogous samples commercially available or similarly prepared in the absence of TOA."
[5] "HRTEM measurements, IR studies on adsorbed CO species and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses evidenced the role of TOA in controlling the particle growth in the preparative process and in stabilizing the resulting Rh particles against erosion by CO and oxidation."
[6] "The results with different catalysts are reported in Table 2."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters like trioctylamine (TOA) address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, TOA helps control the particle growth during the preparation process and stabilizes the resulting Rh particles against erosion by CO and oxidation. This leads to more active and selective catalysts compared to commercial samples or those prepared without TOA.

促进剂如三辛胺（TOA）通过增强二氧化碳的活化、提高氧化能力并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化电位和惰性的问题。具体来说，TOA有助于控制制备过程中的颗粒生长，并稳定最终得到的铑颗粒对抗CO和氧化的侵蚀。这导致了比商用样品或在不使用TOA的情况下准备的催化剂更加活跃和选择性的催化剂。
