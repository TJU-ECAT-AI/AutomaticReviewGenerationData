[1] "They are largely more active than the analogous commercial catalyst, as well as of a sample similarly prepared in the absence of TOA."
[2] "Strong interacting ligands, like tetraalkylammonium halides, poly-N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1,10-phenantroline, have been found to restrict the catalytic activity."
[3] "hydroxyalkyl ammonium salts or aliphatic amines with long alkyl groups (C8 or higher) have been reported to greatly improve the efficiency of the catalytic precursor."
[4] "With the aim to provide a further insight into the subject, we have studied the activity of catalysts prepared from arene-solvated Rh atoms, containing trioctylamine (TOA) as additional stabilizer."
[5] "Such systems are excellent starting materials for the preparation of new supported catalysts largely more active and selective than analogous samples commercially available or similarly prepared in the absence of TOA."

Promoters, specifically trioctylamine (TOA), address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies such as oxygen co-feeding, TOA provides several advantages. It allows for more efficient CO2 utilization, leads to better control over the oxidation process, and ensures more consistent and prolonged catalytic activity. By stabilizing the Rh nanoparticles and controlling their growth during preparation, TOA contributes to the creation of catalysts that are not only more active but also more selective and stable than those produced using commercial catalysts or without the use of TOA.

促进剂，特别是三辛基胺（TOA），通过增强CO2的氧化潜力和改善其惰性来解决铬基催化剂系统中的限制。与氧气共供给等替代策略相比，TOA提供了一系列优势。它能更有效地利用CO2，更好地控制氧化过程，并确保更一致且持续的催化活性。通过在制备过程中稳定铑纳米粒子并控制其生长，TOA有助于创造活性更高、选择性和稳定性更好的催化剂，这些催化剂比商业可用的催化剂或在不使用TOA的情况下制备的催化剂要好。
