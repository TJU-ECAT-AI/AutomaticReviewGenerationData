[1] "Recently, there has been a great deal of attention on the use of metal nanoparticles as valuable catalysts [1]. Their catalytic properties are strongly related to the particle size and recent findings on their size-dependent chemistry has added a new dimension to the subject [2]."
[2] "Moreover, solvent-stabilized metal microclusters, ob- tained by reaction of metal vapour with weakly co- ordinating organic ligands (acetone, tetrahydrofuran,toluene, etc.) (solvated metal atoms), are very active homogeneous catalytic precursors in a wide range of reactions, including hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, hy- droformylation, silylformylation and oligo-polymeriza- tion of olefins and acetylenes [1c,1l,5]."
[3] "With the aim to provide a further insight into the subject, we have studied the activity of catalysts prepared from arene- solvated Rh atoms, containing trioctylamine (TOA) as additional stabilizer."
[4] "Such systems are excellent starting materials for the preparation of new supported catalysts largely more active and selective than analogous samples commercially available or similarly prepared in the absence of TOA."
[5] "We report here evidence for their peculiar catalytic properties and some data on their structural features. For this, the catalysts have been characterized by HRTEM analyses, IR studies on adsorbed CO species and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) investigations."

Promoters enhance the activation of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems by addressing the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness. They offer several advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, including:

1. Improving CO2 activation: Promoters facilitate the conversion of CO2 into more reactive intermediates, making it easier for the catalyst to oxidize it efficiently.
2. Enhancing oxidizing ability: By stabilizing the active sites of the catalyst, promoters maintain a high concentration of active species, leading to a stronger oxidizing environment.
3. Achieving selective and stable catalytic performance: Promoters ensure that the catalytic process occurs selectively, without unwanted side reactions, and maintain the stability of the catalyst over multiple reaction cycles.

These advantages make promoters crucial for the development of efficient and sustainable processes for CO2 utilization in various industrial applications.

促进剂通过解决CO2弱氧化电位和惰性的问题，提高了铬基催化体系中CO2的活化。与氧气共供等替代策略相比，它们在以下几个方面提供了优势：

1. 提高CO2活化：促进剂促进了CO2转化为更易反应的中间体，使得催化剂能够高效地氧化它。
2. 增强氧化能力：通过稳定催化剂的活性位点，促进剂维持了高浓度的活性物种，形成了更强的氧化环境。
3. 实现选择性和稳定的催化性能：促进剂确保催化过程的选择性，避免了不必要的副反应，并保持催化剂在多次反应周期中的稳定性。

这些优势对于开发各种工业应用中CO2利用的高效和可持续过程至关重要。
