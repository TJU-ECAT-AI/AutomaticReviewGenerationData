1. Enhancing CO2 activation and oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems: Challenges, strategies, and the role of promoters in improving performance and selectivity

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/j.micromeso.2019.04.016\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ja070908q\], \[10.1016/j.jece.2018.07.032\], and \[10.1016/j.catcom.2013.05.002\]. The incorporation of chromium (Cr) as a promoter into mesoporous silica spheres (MSS) significantly enhances their catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, especially when optimized Cr adding time in the sol-gel process is considered. This approach addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the activation of CO2 and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, the use of promoters offers several advantages including enhanced CO2 activation, improved oxidizing ability, and selective and stable catalytic performance.

        An alternative is to introduce promoters to facilitate CO2 activation on the Cr2O3 catalysts and to improve its oxidizing ability for selective and stable performance. Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating CO2 activation and improving the catalyst's oxidizing ability. By incorporating these promoters into the structure, the materials achieve selective and stable catalytic performance, facilitating CO2 molecule adsorption and activation. Compared to O2 co-feeding, the promoter strategy offers an efficient, direct method for CO2 activation.

        The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas. At that same reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. 1c, CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98% at a temperature 150 K less than that of methane dry reforming (DRM). Furthermore, in the CO2+C3H8 system, unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + Cs 2CO) at temperatures as low as 773 K with moderate rates. While there are studies that examine the CO2-ODHP or DRP separately, a thorough examination utilizing supported bimetallic catalysts at a temperature range that allows both pathways to occur is still lacking. Results for conversions and product selectivity following time on stream for all catalysts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts. The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions, the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a). The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to calculate the change in energy for the oxidative CH and CC bond scission of propane. According to the DFT calculations, on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111), the *O insertion reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O *CH3CH2CH2O + *) along the CC bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.75 eV and Ea = 1.07 eV) is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O *CH3CHCH2 + *OH) along the CH bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.51 eV and Ea = 1.33 eV).

        In comparison, the use of promoters enables the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, efficiently utilizing underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. Studies on bimetallic systems like Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt demonstrate optimized reaction pathways, with Ni3Pt showing high CO selectivity in dry reforming. The thermodynamic and kinetic superiority of *O insertion reactions on Ni3Pt catalysts underscores the role of promoters in achieving efficient CO2 utilization and product selectivity.

        Zeolites H-ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr), and morpholine as directing agents, respectively. It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite; and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite. H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene. Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock. Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream.

        The use of promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems addresses CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, offering an alternative to O2 co-feeding for enhanced CO2 activation and improved oxidizing ability. Key advantages include selective and stable catalytic performance, avoiding chromium toxicity and severe coking issues. Specifically, promoters enable the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, efficiently utilizing underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. Studies on bimetallic systems like Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt demonstrate optimized reaction pathways, with Ni3Pt showing high CO selectivity in dry reforming. The thermodynamic and kinetic superiority of *O insertion reactions on Ni3Pt catalysts underscores the role of promoters in achieving efficient CO2 utilization and product selectivity.

        In the case of the Ni-Ca, Ni-Mn, and Ni-Sn-modified catalysts, the situation seems different since after 30 h on stream, they show a significant reduction in activity and also important accumulation of deactivating carbon. The results obtained in this work with the K-containing catalysts can be explained on the basis of these conclusions. Potassium and other additives are selectively located on the step edges of the nickel surface. To prevent the nucleation of carbon, a small fraction of active sites have to be blocked on the stepped nickel surface. Also, it is well known that potassium is a good catalyst for carbon gasification. The addition of Mn produced a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, with a small decrease in catalytic activity. Compared to the unmodified catalyst, only Co, Cu, and Zr showed a slight improvement in activity, while the rest of the additives reduced the activity in dry reforming. In the case of Ca, Mn, and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study.

        An alternative approach is to use potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) as promoters to enhance the CO2 activation and oxidizing ability of Ni-Al2O3 catalysts. Potassium specifically inhibits carbon accumulation, boosts reducibility, and modifies metal-support interactions without altering nickel particle size. Calcium, manganese, and tin lead to a significant reduction in catalytic activity and increased carbon deposition over time. Oxygen co-feeding is compared as an alternative strategy, but promoters offer distinct advantages in achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

        In summary, promoters significantly enhance chromium-based catalysts' oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) activity, addressing CO2's low reactivity by enhancing its activation, offering superior CO2 activation, increased oxidizing capability, and achieving selective and stable performance over O2 co-feeding. These advantages, highlighted by the texts, underscore the effectiveness of promoters in overcoming CO2's limitations in catalytic applications.
