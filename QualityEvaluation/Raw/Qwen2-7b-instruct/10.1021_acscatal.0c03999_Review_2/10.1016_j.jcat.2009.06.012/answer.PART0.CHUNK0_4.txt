[1] "The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support."
[2] "For instance, the results obtained from the reaction of 1-hex- yne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts."
[3] "As clearly indicated by the HRTEM analysis, diluted MVS solutions give rise to highly dispersed small gold particles that show very good specific activity, whereas concentrated solvated metal atoms generate supported nanoclusters with a larger size distribution and mean diameter, which are totally inactive."
[4] "However, ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then improves the catalytic efficiency of these species."

1. The performance of gold catalysts is influenced by two primary factors: the size of the gold particles and the type of support material. 

2. When 1-hexyne undergoes hydrosilylation with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 with a 0.05 mol% loading, it demonstrates high selectivity and exceptional specific activities characteristic of gold catalysts.

3. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis (MVS) solutions lead to the creation of finely dispersed small gold particles, which exhibit superior specific activity. Conversely, concentrated MVS solutions produce larger-sized gold nanoclusters that are completely inactive.

4. In the case of ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the relationship between gold loading and catalytic efficiency deviates from the general trend. A strong interface between gold and the metal oxide reduces the number of active sites. Consequently, increasing the gold amount on the support enhances the catalytic performance of these species.

1. 铂催化剂的性能主要由金颗粒的大小和支撑材料的选择两个主要因素决定。

2. 当1-己炔在氧化铝上以0.05摩尔%负载的Au/c-Al2O3存在下与三乙基硅烷进行氢化硅烷化时，显示出高选择性和出色的特定活性。

3. 稀释的金属蒸气合成（MVS）溶液产生高度分散的小金颗粒，具有非常好的特定活性。相反，浓缩的MVS溶液生成较大的尺寸分布和平均直径的金纳米簇，这些是完全无活性的。

4. 对于ZrO2-和TiO2支持的催化剂，在金负载和催化效率之间的关系偏离了普遍趋势。金与金属氧化物之间的强界面减少了催化剂的活性位点。因此，增加支撑上的金含量提高了这些物种的催化性能。
