Solvated gold atoms prepared according to the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique can be used for the preparation of supported species that provide active catalysts for the hydrosilylation of terminal acetylenes with high regioselectivity (>90%) for the E isomer. Two main factors seem to play an important role in the catalytic performance of the supported species: the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support.

Promoters enhance the activation of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems by addressing its weak oxidation potential and inertness. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by selectively improving CO2 activation, enhancing the oxidizing ability of the system, and achieving stable and selective catalytic performance. The key factors influencing the effectiveness of these promoters are the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support material.
