[1] "The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts."
[2] "Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals. Upon coordination and formation of the corresponding adduct, the alkyne becomes activated and more reactive towards nucleophiles such as alcohols, water, amines, and hydrosilanes."
[3] "We were particularly intrigued by the possibility of keeping the particle sizes very small even when the amount of metal on the support was increased."
[4] "As already detected in the reactions promoted by Au/c-Al2O3 (Table 2, entries 2 and 4), when the hydrosilylation process was performed in the presence of gold nanoparticles supported on Fe2O3 with a 4.50% (w/w) metal loading, the value of the specific activity was about half of that of the 0.10% (w/w) sample (Table 4, entry 2 vs. entry 3)."

1. The high selectivity and specific activities of gold catalysts were demonstrated through the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%). Gold's unique ability to coordinate with triple bonds activates alkynes and makes them more reactive towards various nucleophiles.

2. Gold nanoparticles can maintain small sizes even when the amount of metal on the support increases, offering advantages in catalytic performance.

3. When the hydrosilylation process was conducted with gold nanoparticles supported on Fe2O3 at a 4.50% (w/w) metal loading, the specific activity was significantly lower compared to the 0.10% (w/w) sample, indicating the importance of metal loading and dispersion.

1. 在存在Au/c-Al2O3（0.05摩尔%）的情况下，通过1-己炔与三乙基硅烷反应，证明了这些金催化剂的高选择性和出色的特定活性。黄金独特的三键配位能力激活了烯烃，并使其对醇、水、胺和氢硅烷等亲核试剂的反应性增强。

2. 金纳米颗粒即使在金属负载增加时也能保持非常小的尺寸，这为催化性能提供了优势。

3. 当在Fe2O3上以4.50%（w/w）金属负载进行氢硅化过程时，与0.10%（w/w）样本相比，特定活性显著降低，表明金属负载和分散的重要性。
