[1] "The results obtained from the reaction of 1-hexyne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts."
[2] "Indeed, the ability of gold to coordinate with triple bonds has no parallel with other transition metals. Upon coordination and formation of the corresponding adduct, the alkyne becomes activated and more reactive towards nucleophiles such as alcohols, water, amines, and hydrosilanes."
[3] "We were particularly intrigued by the possibility of keeping the particle sizes very small even when the amount of metal on the support was increased."
[4] "As already detected in the reactions promoted by Au/c-Al2O3 (Table 2, entries 2 and 4), when the hydrosilylation process was performed in the presence of gold nanoparticles supported on Fe2O3 with a 4.50% (w/w) metal loading, the value of the specific activity was about half of that of the 0.10% (w/w) sample (Table 4, entry 2 vs. entry 3)."

[1] "In the field of hydrosilylation reactions, gold was ignored until 2000 when Hosomi and co-workers [19] described the first example of silane addition to aldehydes using a catalytic amount of AuCl(PPh3)."
[2] "Their work stimulated other research groups [2025] that investigated gold-catalyzed hydrosilylations of carbonyl and olefin substrates."
[3] "Recently, we published [26] the regioselective hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne activated by gold nanoparticles supported on carbon and c-Al2O3."
[4] "We compared the catalytic performance of gold species with the performance of platinum-based catalysts and observed an opposite affinity between the two metals and the silanes."
[5] "Indeed, a gold catalyst was required in the reactions performed with Me2PhSiH or Et3SiH, while a platinum species had to be used in the presence of chlorosilanes."
[6] "Both platinum- and gold-supported nanoparticles were generated using the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique [27] (MVS), a versatile method that can be employed for the preparation of colloidal solutions of metal nanoclusters."

1. The limitation of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems can be addressed through the use of promoters that enhance CO2 activation, improve the oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance. Promoters can offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by providing a more efficient route for CO2 activation and by enabling selective and stable catalytic performance without the need for additional oxygen.

2. The regioselective hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne was achieved using gold nanoparticles supported on carbon and c-Al2O3. This method demonstrated an opposite affinity between gold and platinum catalysts towards silanes, requiring gold for reactions with Me2PhSiH or Et3SiH, while platinum was necessary for reactions with chlorosilanes.

3. Gold nanoparticles were generated using the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique (MVS), a versatile method capable of preparing colloidal solutions of metal nanoclusters that can be directly deposited on organic or inorganic matrices with a chosen metal loading and without any further activation process. This technique allowed for the preparation of supported gold nanoparticles with different sizes and metal loadings.

4. The use of gold nanoparticles in catalytic systems can provide an efficient route for CO2 activation, leading to improved oxidizing ability and selective and stable catalytic performance. The Metal Vapour Synthesis technique offers a method for the preparation of these nanoparticles with controlled size and loading, potentially enhancing the overall performance of the catalytic systems.

<p>However, the differences among these values could not ac- 
count for the different catalytic behaviour of the materials, as can be inferred from the observed trends of the relative specific activity and relative specific metal surface areas (Table 3, columns 7 and 9).</p>
<p>Furthermore, differences in the relative abundance of the vari- 
ious size classes cannot easily account for the differences in cata- 
lytic activity.</p>
<p>As for this last aspect, during TEM observation of Au/TiO2 and Au/ZrO2, few Au particles appeared suitably located on the surface of the grains of the supports to allow the observation of an extended interface with the support (see insets of Fig. 3c and d). Unluckily, no metal parti- 
cles properly oriented to obtain equivalent images were observed in the case of Au/CeO2 and Au/Fe2O3.</p>

The limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems can be addressed by using promoters that enhance CO2 activation and improve the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Promoters can offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of selective and stable catalytic performance. They can enable more efficient CO2 conversion to valuable products, such as fuels and chemicals, by facilitating the activation of CO2 and promoting the desired reaction pathways.

In the context of the provided literature, the limitations of gold nanoparticles in the hydrosilylation of acetylenes are discussed. The size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support material play crucial roles in determining the catalytic performance. Dilation of MVS solutions leads to the formation of highly dispersed small gold particles that display good specific activity. Conversely, concentrated solvated metal atoms produce supported nanoclusters with a larger size distribution and mean diameter, which are ineffective. The study highlights the importance of optimizing the gold particle size and support interaction for achieving optimal catalytic activity in the hydrosilylation reaction. This approach contrasts with traditional methods like O2 co-feeding, offering a potentially more efficient and selective route to the desired products through precise control over the catalyst properties.

Solvated gold atoms prepared according to the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique can be used for the preparation of supported species that provide active catalysts for the hydrosilylation of terminal acetylenes with high regioselectivity (>90%) for the E isomer. Two main factors seem to play an important role in the catalytic performance of the supported species: the size of the gold particles and their interaction with the support.

[1] "The catalytic performance of Au is defined by two major factors: particle size and choice of support."
[2] "For instance, the results obtained from the reaction of 1-hex- yne with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 (0.05 mol%) demonstrate the high selectivity and the excellent specific activities typical of these gold catalysts."
[3] "As clearly indicated by the HRTEM analysis, diluted MVS solutions give rise to highly dispersed small gold particles that show very good specific activity, whereas concentrated solvated metal atoms generate supported nanoclusters with a larger size distribution and mean diameter, which are totally inactive."
[4] "However, ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts did not follow this general trend. In these cases, a strong interfacial contact between Au and the metal oxide could reduce the number of active sites of the catalysts; an increase of the gold amount on the support then improves the catalytic efficiency of these species."
</quotes>

1. The performance of gold catalysts is influenced by two primary factors: the size of the gold particles and the type of support material. 

2. When 1-hexyne undergoes hydrosilylation with triethylsilane in the presence of Au/c-Al2O3 with a 0.05 mol% loading, it demonstrates high selectivity and exceptional specific activities characteristic of gold catalysts.

3. Diluted Metal Vapour Synthesis (MVS) solutions lead to the creation of finely dispersed small gold particles, which exhibit superior specific activity. Conversely, concentrated MVS solutions produce larger-sized gold nanoclusters that are completely inactive.

4. In the case of ZrO2- and TiO2-supported catalysts, the relationship between gold loading and catalytic efficiency deviates from the general trend. A strong interface between gold and the metal oxide reduces the number of active sites. Consequently, increasing the gold amount on the support enhances the catalytic performance of these species.

1. 铂催化剂的性能主要由金颗粒的大小和支撑材料的选择两个主要因素决定。

2. 当1-己炔在氧化铝上以0.05摩尔%负载的Au/c-Al2O3存在下与三乙基硅烷进行氢化硅烷化时，显示出高选择性和出色的特定活性。

3. 稀释的金属蒸气合成（MVS）溶液产生高度分散的小金颗粒，具有非常好的特定活性。相反，浓缩的MVS溶液生成较大的尺寸分布和平均直径的金纳米簇，这些是完全无活性的。

4. 对于ZrO2-和TiO2支持的催化剂，在金负载和催化效率之间的关系偏离了普遍趋势。金与金属氧化物之间的强界面减少了催化剂的活性位点。因此，增加支撑上的金含量提高了这些物种的催化性能。
