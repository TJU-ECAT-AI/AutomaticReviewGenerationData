[1] "In the field of hydrosilylation reactions, gold was ignored until 2000 when Hosomi and co-workers [19] described the first example of silane addition to aldehydes using a catalytic amount of AuCl(PPh3)."
[2] "Their work stimulated other research groups [2025] that investigated gold-catalyzed hydrosilylations of carbonyl and olefin substrates."
[3] "Recently, we published [26] the regioselective hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne activated by gold nanoparticles supported on carbon and c-Al2O3."
[4] "We compared the catalytic performance of gold species with the performance of platinum-based catalysts and observed an opposite affinity between the two metals and the silanes."
[5] "Indeed, a gold catalyst was required in the reactions performed with Me2PhSiH or Et3SiH, while a platinum species had to be used in the presence of chlorosilanes."
[6] "Both platinum- and gold-supported nanoparticles were generated using the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique [27] (MVS), a versatile method that can be employed for the preparation of colloidal solutions of metal nanoclusters."

1. The limitation of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems can be addressed through the use of promoters that enhance CO2 activation, improve the oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance. Promoters can offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by providing a more efficient route for CO2 activation and by enabling selective and stable catalytic performance without the need for additional oxygen.

2. The regioselective hydrosilylation of 1-hexyne was achieved using gold nanoparticles supported on carbon and c-Al2O3. This method demonstrated an opposite affinity between gold and platinum catalysts towards silanes, requiring gold for reactions with Me2PhSiH or Et3SiH, while platinum was necessary for reactions with chlorosilanes.

3. Gold nanoparticles were generated using the Metal Vapour Synthesis technique (MVS), a versatile method capable of preparing colloidal solutions of metal nanoclusters that can be directly deposited on organic or inorganic matrices with a chosen metal loading and without any further activation process. This technique allowed for the preparation of supported gold nanoparticles with different sizes and metal loadings.

4. The use of gold nanoparticles in catalytic systems can provide an efficient route for CO2 activation, leading to improved oxidizing ability and selective and stable catalytic performance. The Metal Vapour Synthesis technique offers a method for the preparation of these nanoparticles with controlled size and loading, potentially enhancing the overall performance of the catalytic systems.

1. 在铬基催化体系中，二氧化碳的弱氧化电势和惰性可以通过使用促进剂来解决，这些促进剂可以增强二氧化碳的活化、提高氧化能力并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。与使用额外氧气的共供给策略相比，促进剂提供了更高效的二氧化碳活化途径，并且不需要额外的氧气就可以实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。

2. 使用碳和c-Al2O3支持的金纳米颗粒实现了1-己炔的区域选择性氢硅烷化。这种方法展示了金和铂催化剂对硅烷的相反亲和力，需要金来进行Me2PhSiH或Et3SiH反应，而需要铂进行氯硅烷反应。

3. 通过金属蒸气合成技术（MVS）制备了金纳米颗粒，这是一种多功能方法，可以准备金属纳米簇的胶体溶液，可以直接沉积在有机或无机矩阵上，具有选择的金属负载，并且无需进一步激活过程。该技术允许制备具有不同大小和金属负载的受支持金纳米颗粒，可能增强催化系统的整体性能。

4. 在催化系统中使用金纳米颗粒可以提供一种有效的二氧化碳活化途径，从而提高氧化能力和实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。金属蒸气合成技术提供了一种制备这些纳米颗粒的方法，具有控制大小和负载，可能增强催化系统的整体性能。
