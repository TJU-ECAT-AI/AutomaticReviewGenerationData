[1] "The reaction of combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane to produce syngas (CRPOM) was tested over Ni/SiO2 catalysts which were prepared via incipient-wetness impregnation using precursors of nickel citrate and nickel nitrate."
[2] "The catalysts prepared from nitrate precursors displayed a rapid decline of catalytic performance."
[3] "However, as the nickel citrate precursor was used, the superior catalytic activity and stability were obtained over Ni/SiO2 catalysts."
[4] "The strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 formed nickel silicate like species over the NiSC, which was the main reason for high nickel dispersion and effectively prevention nickel particle from sintering at high reaction temperatures."

The use of nickel citrate as a precursor significantly improved the catalytic activity and stability of Ni/SiO2 catalysts in the CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane reactions. This improvement was attributed to the formation of nickel silicate-like species through a strong interaction between NiO and SiO2. These species facilitated high dispersion of nickel, preventing particle sintering at high reaction temperatures. This contrasts with the use of nickel nitrate, which resulted in larger particle sizes and poor catalytic performance, especially for lower nickel loadings.

镍柠檬酸作为前驱体在二氧化碳重整和甲烷部分氧化合成合成气反应中显著提高了Ni/SiO2催化剂的催化活性和稳定性。这种改进归因于NiO与SiO2之间形成的镍硅酸盐类似物。这些物种促进了镍的高度分散，防止了高温下颗粒的聚集。这与使用镍硝酸盐的情况形成对比，后者导致了较大的颗粒尺寸和较差的催化性能，尤其是在较低镍负载的情况下。
