[1] "The production of syngas from methane is one of the most promising utilization approaches of natural gas, which is now recognized to be one of the potential substitute resources for petroleum due to its abundant storage in the world."
[2] "Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process,and (3) a safer operating environment."
[3] "Recently, Ni-based catalysts have attracted considerable interest primarily due to their inexpensiveness and high activity compared to noble-metal-based catalysts."
[4] "The Ni/SiO2 prepared with the nickel citrate precursor exhibited good catalytic performances for its highly dispersed metallic nickel derived from the nickel silicate species."
[5] "The strong interaction between NiO and SiO2 formed nickel silicate like species over the NiSC, which was the main reason for high nickel dispersion and effectively prevention nickel particle from sintering at high reaction temperatures."

The use of promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Promoters offer several advantages over alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding. Specifically, they facilitate better dispersion of active sites, reduce the risk of particle sintering, and optimize the product ratio, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for CO2 utilization. The nickel citrate precursor, for instance, leads to the formation of nickel silicate-like species through strong interactions with the support material, resulting in a catalyst with high dispersion and stability at high temperatures. This ensures effective utilization of CO2 and enhances the overall performance of the catalytic system.
