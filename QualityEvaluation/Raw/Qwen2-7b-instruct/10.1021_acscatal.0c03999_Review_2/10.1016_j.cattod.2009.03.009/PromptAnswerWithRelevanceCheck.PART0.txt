The use of nickel citrate as a precursor leads to improved interaction between NiO and the support, forming nickel silicate-like species. These species can be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high temperatures. This process results in high dispersion of nickel, contributing to the catalyst's excellent activity.

The use of nickel citrate as a precursor in the preparation of Ni/SiO2 catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic performance for the CRPOM reaction. This is due to the strong interaction between NiO and the support material, SiO2, which forms nickel silicate-like species. These species can be reduced at high temperatures to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel. This results in excellent thermal stability and high dispersion of Ni over the catalyst, which are crucial factors for its superior catalytic activity.

The use of nickel citrate as a precursor significantly improved the catalytic activity and stability of Ni/SiO2 catalysts in the CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane reactions. This improvement was attributed to the formation of nickel silicate-like species through a strong interaction between NiO and SiO2. These species facilitated high dispersion of nickel, preventing particle sintering at high reaction temperatures. This contrasts with the use of nickel nitrate, which resulted in larger particle sizes and poor catalytic performance, especially for lower nickel loadings.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of nickel citrate as a precursor leads to the formation of nickel silicate-like species through strong interaction with the support material, silicon dioxide (SiO2). These species can be reduced at high temperatures to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel, resulting in enhanced dispersion of nickel over the catalyst surface. This high dispersion is crucial for achieving high activity and stability, especially under high reaction temperatures, where metallic nickel tends to sinter. The strong interaction between nickel oxide and the SiO2 support forms the nickel silicate-like species, which prevents sintering and maintains a high level of dispersion, leading to superior catalytic performance compared to catalysts prepared using nickel nitrate as the precursor.

The use of promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Promoters offer several advantages over alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding. Specifically, they facilitate better dispersion of active sites, reduce the risk of particle sintering, and optimize the product ratio, leading to more efficient and environmentally friendly processes for CO2 utilization. The nickel citrate precursor, for instance, leads to the formation of nickel silicate-like species through strong interactions with the support material, resulting in a catalyst with high dispersion and stability at high temperatures. This ensures effective utilization of CO2 and enhances the overall performance of the catalytic system.
