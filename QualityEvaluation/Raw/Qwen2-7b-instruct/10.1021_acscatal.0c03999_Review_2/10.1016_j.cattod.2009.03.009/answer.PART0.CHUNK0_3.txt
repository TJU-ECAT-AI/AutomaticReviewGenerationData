[1] "Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process, and (3) a safer operating environment."
[2] "In our previous works [7,8], Ni/SiO2 catalysts modified by MOx (M: alkaline metal,alkaline earth metal, rare earth metal) prepared with nitrate precursor exhibited excellent resistance to carbon deposition and stable catalytic performance in fluidized bed reactor."
[3] "However, as the nickel citrate precursor was used, the superior catalytic activity and stability were obtained over Ni/SiO2 catalysts."

The use of nickel citrate as a precursor leads to the formation of nickel silicate-like species through strong interaction with the support material, silicon dioxide (SiO2). These species can be reduced at high temperatures to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel, resulting in enhanced dispersion of nickel over the catalyst surface. This high dispersion is crucial for achieving high activity and stability, especially under high reaction temperatures, where metallic nickel tends to sinter. The strong interaction between nickel oxide and the SiO2 support forms the nickel silicate-like species, which prevents sintering and maintains a high level of dispersion, leading to superior catalytic performance compared to catalysts prepared using nickel nitrate as the precursor.

镍柠檬酸作为前体，通过与支撑材料二氧化硅（SiO2）之间的强烈相互作用形成镍硅酸盐类似物。这些物种在高温下可以被还原为金属镍的小晶粒，导致催化剂表面镍的高度分散。这种高度分散对于在高温下实现高活性和稳定性至关重要，尤其是在金属镍容易发生烧结的情况下。NiO与SiO2支持之间的强相互作用形成了镍硅酸盐类似物，这防止了烧结并保持了高度的分散性，从而导致了优于使用镍硝酸盐作为前体制备的催化剂的优越催化性能。
