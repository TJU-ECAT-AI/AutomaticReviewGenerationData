[1] "Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process,and (3) a safer operating environment."
[2] "The reaction of combination of CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane to produce syngas (CRPOM) was tested over Ni/SiO2 catalysts which were prepared via incipient-wetness impregnation using precursors of nickel citrate and nickel nitrate."
[3] "The nickel citrate precursor strengthened interaction between NiO and support to form nickel silicate like species which could be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high temperatures."
[4] "The crystallite size of metallic nickel over the 3NiSC after 6 h reaction on stream was about 4.5 nm, which indicated that the 3NiSC showed excellent thermal stability."
[5] "High dispersion of Ni over the 3NiSC might be a main reason for its excellent catalytic activity."

The use of nickel citrate as a precursor in the preparation of Ni/SiO2 catalysts significantly enhances the catalytic performance for the CRPOM reaction. This is due to the strong interaction between NiO and the support material, SiO2, which forms nickel silicate-like species. These species can be reduced at high temperatures to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel. This results in excellent thermal stability and high dispersion of Ni over the catalyst, which are crucial factors for its superior catalytic activity.

使用镍柠檬酸作为前体在制备Ni/SiO2催化剂中的应用，显著提高了CRPOM反应的催化性能。这是由于NiO和支撑材料SiO2之间强烈的相互作用，形成了镍硅酸盐类似物。这些物种可以在高温下被还原成小晶粒的金属镍。这导致了出色的热稳定性以及Ni在催化剂上的高度分散，这些都是其优异催化活性的关键因素。
