[1] "Compared to POM and CDR, CRPOM is a green and preponderant process: (1) energy coupling, (2) controllable product ratio of H2/CO according to the need of the post-process,and (3) a safer operating environment."
[2] "For its good mechanical strength and high-surface area, spherical silica (SiO2) is widely used as a catalyst support in fluidized bed reactor."
[3] "In recent years, Ni-based catalysts have attracted considerable interest primarily due to their inexpensiveness and high activity compared to noble-metal-based catalysts."
[4] "The nickel citrate precursor strengthened interaction between NiO and support to form nickel silicate like species which could be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high temperatures."
[5] "High dispersion of Ni over the 3NiSC might be a main reason for its excellent catalytic activity."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of nickel citrate as a precursor leads to improved interaction between NiO and the support, forming nickel silicate-like species. These species can be reduced to produce small crystallites of metallic nickel at high temperatures. This process results in high dispersion of nickel, contributing to the catalyst's excellent activity.

镍柠檬酸作为前驱体，能够增强NiO与支撑物之间的相互作用，形成类似于镍硅酸盐的物种。这些物种可以在高温下被还原为小晶粒的金属镍。这一过程导致了镍的高度分散，从而为催化剂提供了出色的活性。
