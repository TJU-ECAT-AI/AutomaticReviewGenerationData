Abstract: 
Effect of nickel loading in nickel catalysts supported on nanocrystalline MgO prepared by 
surfactant assisted precipitation (M1) method were evaluated in reverse water gas shift 
(RWGS) reaction. Due to high nickel dispersion and basicity of support 7% Ni showed highest 
CO2 conversion and good CO selectivity. Increase of nickel loading higher than 7% was in 
favor of methanation. The 7% Ni was also supported on MgO prepared by ultrasonic assisted 
precipitation method (M2). The 7Ni-M2 showed higher CO2 conversion but lower CO 
selectivity in comparison with 7Ni-M1. The supports and catalysts were charactrized by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption-desorption (BET), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) 
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The BET results revealed narrower pore 
size distribution and smaller total pore volume for M2 support and 7Ni-M2 catalyst. 7Ni-M1 
showed great catalytic stability after 50 hours on stream at 600 oC. The results also showed that 
increase in H2/CO2 molar ratio enhanced the CO2 conversion but decreased the CO selectivity.

In the past decades emission of CO2, which is the main greenhouse gas has increased. 
Conversion of CO2 via catalytic processes like reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGS) can 
mitigate the net amount of CO2 emitted in the atmosphere. Direct conversion of CO2 into 
valuable products shows very low conversion rates, while CO is highly reactive and the RWGS 
reaction (1) has relatively high equilibrium conversion rate. By removing the moisture from 
product stream, the produced CO along with appropriate amount of H2 (syngas) can be used as 
feedstock for methanol and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

Different types of support have been investigated in this process. CeO2 is widely studied as 
catalyst support due to its high oxygen storage capability [1]. Ni, Cu, Co, Fe, Mn and Pt have 
been supported on CeO2 [2-5]. Nickel catalysts supported on ceria displayed good catalytic 
activity. However, by increasing the nickel content higher than 2%, methanation as the main 
side reaction increased and selectivity of CO decreased. Monometallic Ni, Cu, Fe, Pd and 
bimetallic combinations such as Ni-Cu, Fe-Mo, Fe-V2O5, Fe-K, Ni- K, Pd-La and Pd-Ce were 
supported on Al2O3 as cost effective support [6-11]. Nickel supported Al2O3 catalysts showed 
high CO2 conversion and low selectivity towards CO. Addition of K as alkaline promoter to 
Ni/Al2O3 catalysts suppressed methanation. Potassium increased the basicity of catalyst and 
created new active sites that facilitated formation and decomposition of formate intermediate 
[10]. Ni, Cu, Fe, Pt, Au and bimetallic combinations like Pt-K, Au-Mo have been supported on 
silica. Nickel supported silica catalysts suffer from low CO2 conversion rates at low metal 
contents, where addition of nickel loading encourages the methanation process [12-17]. 
Mesostructured silica supports such as SBA-15 with their modified structure and high specific 
surface area could better disperse Ni particles and showed higher CO2 conversion and CO 
selectivity in comparison with SiO2 [18]. Transition metal carbides (TMCs) have received 
considerable attention with their dual functionalities for H2 dissociation and C=O bond

scission. Ni, Cu and Co have been supported on Mo2C; they all showed high CO2 conversion 
and CO selectivity at elevated pressures. The main drawback of TMCs is that they can't endure 
high temperatures [19, 20]. Rodrigues et al. used Mg(Al)O (MgO:Al2O3=70:30) mixed oxide 
as support for Ni catalysts [21]. Great catalytic performance and CO selectivity of this catalyst 
was related to Mg(Al,Ni)O vacancies and Ni0 species on the surface of catalyst. Other types of 
oxides like ZrO2, ZnO, In2O3, Ga2O3 and their mixture with CeO2 were also employed in 
RWGS reaction. Presence or incorporation of CeO2 created more oxygen vacancies and 
enhanced the CO2 adsorption [22-28]. Mixed oxide solid solutions like ZnxZr1-xO2-y, Fe2O3-
Ce0.5Zr0.5O2, La0.75Sr0.25CoO3 and BaZr0.8Y0.16Zn0.04O3 have also been evaluated in RWGS 
reaction. These solid solutions offered high oxygen mobility and activity at high temperatures 
[29-32].  
The aim of this study is to introduce a cost effective support for nickel based catalysts in RWGS 
reaction. The catalyst used for RWGS reaction should have high CO2 conversion and stability, 
while it suppresses the methanation process. MgO with its basic nature can increase CO2 
adsorption as reported for reactions like carbon dioxide reforming of methane [33-38]. In this 
research, magnesium oxide as alkaline earth metal oxide support is prepared by surfactant 
assisted precipitation and ultrasonic assisted precipitation methods for Ni catalysts. The Ni 
catalysts with different Ni loadings are prepared and evaluated in RWGS reaction.

2.1. Surfactant assisted MgO (M1)  
For preparation of surfactant assisted MgO (M1), CTAB (Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide) 
with surfactant to metal ion ratio equal to 0.01 was dissolved in distilled water under intensive 
stirring to form a transparent solution. Then, appropriate amount of magnesium precursor 
(Mg(NO3)2.6H2O) was dissolved in solution containing surfactant. NH4OH as precipitating 
agent was added drop wise to the solution at 30oC by careful adjustment of pH to 10. When 
precipitation was occurred the mixture was refluxed for another 12 h at 60oC under continuous 
stirring. The precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water to remove CTAB and the 
nitrates. Final product was air dried at 80oC for 24 h, calcined at 700oC with heating rate of 
3oC/min and held for 4 h at 700oC. 
2.2 Ultrasonic assisted MgO (M2) 
For preparation of ultrasonic assisted MgO (M2), the same chemicals were used as M1 support. 
After dissolving the surfactant and Mg(NO3)2.6H2O the same amount of NH4OH used for M1 
support was added drop wise to the solution under ultrasonic waves (60 W) for 40 min. The 
M2 support was refluxed, dried and calcined at the same condition as surfactant assisted MgO 
(M1). 
2.3. Catalyst preparation 
Supported nickel catalysts were prepared by impregnation technique. Firstly the prepared 
support was dispersed in distilled water, afterwards calculated amount of Ni (NO3)2·6H2O was 
added to the solution to obtain 2, 5, 7, 10 and 15 wt. % nickel content. The mixture was stirred 
for 4 h at room temperature. After impregnation, the prepared samples were air dried at 80oC 
for 24 h and calcined at 600oC for 4h.

The XRD patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (PANalytical X'Pert-Pro) using a 
Cu-Kα monochromatized radiation source and a Ni filter in the range 2θ = 10° to 80°. Analysis 
were compared with Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Powder diffraction file 
no.87-0653 for MgO, no. 89-7101 for NiO and no.70-989 for Ni. The BET surface areas were 
determined by nitrogen adsorption at -196°C using an automated gas adsorption analyzer 
(Tristar 3000, Micromeritics).  
Temperature programmed reduction (TPR–H2) spectra was obtained using a classical 
experimental setup with a flow microreactor and TCD detector. 200 mg of fresh catalyst was 
submitted to a heat treatment (10 ºC/min up to 800ºC) in a gas flow (30 ml/min) containing 10 
vol% H2 and 90 vol% Ar. Previous to the TPR-H2 experiment, the samples were out gassed 
under inert atmosphere at 300ºC. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed with 
VEGA TESCAN, operated at 30 kV. 
2.5. Catalyst testing 
Activity measurements were carried out in a fixed-bed continuous- flow reactor made of a 8-
mm-i.d. quartz tube at atmospheric pressure. The reactor was charged with 200 mg catalyst 
with 40–60 mesh for each test. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was reduced in situ at 600°C 
for 4 h in flowing H2 (30 ml/min) and cooled down to 400°C in a flow of Ar (30 ml/min). 
Afterwards reactant gas feed consisting of H2:CO2=1:1 and a total flow of 50 ml/min was 
introduced into the reactor. Inlet flow of reactant gases were monitored by mass flow 
controllers while the outlet flow was measured with bubble flow meter. The activity tests were 
carried out at different temperatures, ranging from 400 to 700°C in steps of 100°C. The product 
stream was analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with thermal conductivity detector 
(TCD) and Carbosieve column. 
The CO2 conversion, CO and CH4 selectivity were evaluated as follows:

3. Results and discussion 
3.1 Catalytic characterization 
Fig. 1a and 1b show the XRD patterns of prepared MgO supports and catalysts. For M1 and 
M2 supports, formation of pure crystalline phase is evident. For nickel catalysts no reflections 
related to NiO is observed. One possibility is the overlapping of NiO characteristic lines at 
37.24˚, 43.29˚ and 62.4˚ with the characteristic lines of MgO at 37.18˚, 43.11˚ and 62.34 ˚. The 
other possibility is formation of NiO-MgO solid solution, which is more probable. The extent 
of NiO incorporation with support and formation of NiO–MgO solid solution depends strongly 
on the calcination temperature. At temperatures higher than 800 oC the dissolution of the Ni2+ 
ions into the MgO occurs and the presence of the NiO phase decreases [39-40]. Fig. 1c shows 
the XRD patterns of reduced catalysts, the peak related to Ni is observed at 44.6 ˚ for catalysts 
with nickel loading higher than 10%. 
The structural properties of prepared supports and catalysts are shown in Table 1. The 
crystallite sizes of prepared supports are calculated on (111), (200), (220), (311) and (222) 
diffraction maxima from the half-width of diffraction peaks (𝛽) using Scherrer's formula. 
The prepared supports show a nanocrystalline structure with average crystallite sizes of 20.2 
and 18.2 nm for M1 and M2, respectively. The BET results show that utilization of ultrasonic 
has slightly increased the specific surface area of M2 support and 7Ni-M2 catalyst.

and 7Ni-M2. 
 
Fig. 2a. reveals the pore size distribution of prepared supports and catalysts. The prepared 
supports and catalysts show multimodal pore size distribution. M2 support and 7Ni-M2 show 
smaller total pore volume and narrower pore size distribution in comparison with M1 and 7Ni-
M1. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms are shown in Fig. 2b. According to the 
IUPAC classification the N2 isotherm is a type Ⅳ isotherm with a large type H3 hysteresis loop 
for all samples except 7Ni-M2. Most oxide carriers and catalysts belong to this class of 
isotherm. This type of hysteresis is usually found in solids consisting of aggregates or 
agglomerates of particles forming slit shaped pores with nonuniform size and/or shape. The N2 
isotherm for 7Ni-M2 is also a type Ⅳ isotherm, but with a H1 hysteresis loop, which is often 
associated to porous materials exhibiting cylindrical and uniform pores [41]. 
Fig. 3 shows the TPR profiles of catalysts with different Ni loadings. The reduction of catalysts 
occurs in wide range of temperature from 200 to 900 oC. There is small peak at temperatures 
lower than 400 oC, which is attributed to bulk nickel oxide with low interaction with the 
support. The second peak around 500 oC is related to NiO with higher interaction to the support.

The third peak at temperatures higher than 700 oC is associated to NiO incorporating with MgO 
support and the formation of NiO–MgO solid solution. In addition, at low Ni loading the Ni2+ 
ions settle in edges and corner sites, and partially diffuse to form solid solution. At higher Ni 
loadings Ni2+ ions also occupy the ‘unreactive’ sites of MgO [39]. Therefore, with increasing 
the nickel loading the reducibility of catalyst enhances and the maximum temperature of peaks 
decreases. The TPR results confirm the results obtained by XRD.

3.2 Catalytic performance 
The CO2 conversion, CO and CH4 selectivity with various Ni loadings on M1 support at 
different temperatures are shown in figure 5a, 5b and 5c, respectively. The CO2 conversion 
increases with temperature for all the catalysts. Conversion of CO2 increases with nickel 
loading up to 7%, at higher nickel loadings decrease of catalytic activity is observed. 2% Ni 
has CO selectivity higher than 99.5 % but it shows lower catalytic activity in comparison with 
other loadings. 7% Ni also shows high CO selectivity of 79.2 % at 400 oC. We can conclude 
that with increasing the nickel content CO selectivity decreases while CH4 selectivity increases, 
especially for loadings higher than 7 %. The high catalytic activity and CO selectivity of 7% 
in comparison with 10% and 15% could be related to high dispersion of nickel species and low 
bulk Ni content on the support [42]. Furthermore, as reported by many researchers for Ni 
catalysts increase of the nickel loading higher than 2% increased the methanation dramatically 
[4, 13, 27], but here due high dispersion of nickel species, basicity of the support and formation 
of NiO-MgO solid solution we have increased the nickel loading up to 7% with acceptable CO 
selectivity. The MgO support with its structure creates new active basic sites for adsorption of 
CO2. Chen et al. used K as a promoter for nickel catalysts, which increased the adsorption of 
CO2 and hindered CH4 formation [10, 15].

CH4 selectivity, H2:CO2=1:1 (GHSV= 1.5× 104 ml.g-1.h-1). 
After that results for nickel catalysts on M1 support were obtained we continued our work with 
loading 7% Ni on M2 support, which has higher surface area and smaller crystallite size. The 
CO2 conversion and CO selectivity of 7Ni-M1 and 7Ni-M2 are compared with each other as 
shown in Fig. 6a and 6b, respectively. The 7Ni catalyst supported on M2 shows higher CO2 
conversion at lower temperatures in comparison with 7Ni-M1. Unlike the CO2 conversion 7Ni-
M2 shows about 8% decrease of CO selectivity at 400 oC. The higher conversion of CO2 is 
related to higher BET surface area of 7Ni-M2 that causes better distribution of nickel species. 
7Ni-M2 has higher specific surface area but lower total pore volume and narrower pore size 
distribution. Since some portion of CO2 gas is adsorbed by active sites of support, reduction of 
total pore volume decreases the amount of CO2 adsorbed [43-44] on M2 and consequently with 
high H2 and low CO2 adsorption formation of CH4 is intensified.

The long term stability test was performed on 7Ni-M1 at 600 oC up to 50 h, see Fig. 7. The

Effect of feed ratio on the catalytic activity and CO selectivity is investigated on 7Ni-M1 at 
600 oC, see Fig. 9a and 9b, respectively. As it can be seen, with increase of H2/CO2 molar ratio 
from 0.5 to 3 CO2 conversion increases, while CO selectivity decreased. Nickel has high 
activity towards H2 dissociation and increase of H2/CO2 molar ratio causes higher CH4 
formation at 600 oC [45].

4. Conclusions: 
Ni catalysts supported on M1 with high specific surface area and nanocrystalline structure 
showed great performance in reverse water gas shift reaction. 7Ni-M1 showed the best catalytic 
activity and reached CO2 conversion of 42.4% at 700 oC. 2Ni-M1 showed CO selectivity higher 
than 99.5% at all temperatures. Increase of the nickel loading more than 7% decreased the 
nickel dispersity and intensified the methanation process.  Due to higher specific surface area, 
narrower pore size distribution and lower total pore volume 7% Ni supported on M2 showed 
higher CO2 conversion but lower CO selectivity. 7Ni-M1 showed stable catalytic performance 
and structure after 50 h on stream. The activity measurement results revealed higher CO2 
conversion and lower CO selectivity with increase of H2/CO2 molar ratio.
