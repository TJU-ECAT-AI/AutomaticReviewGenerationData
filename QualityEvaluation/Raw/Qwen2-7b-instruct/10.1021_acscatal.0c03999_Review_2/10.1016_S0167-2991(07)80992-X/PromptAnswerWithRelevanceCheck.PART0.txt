The study focuses on the catalytic performance of zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 in the cracking of C4-olefin. It was discovered that the acid strength of these samples decreases in the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. Among these samples, H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the optimal catalyst for the production of propylene from C4-olefin cracking.

[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream.

The study focused on the catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefins over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. These zeolites were synthesized using different directing agents and were evaluated for their performance in cracking reactions under high weight hourly space velocity. The researchers found that the acid strength of the samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic tests followed the opposite order. H-ZSM-5 zeolite, especially when in smaller crystal size form, proved to be the most effective catalyst for producing propylene from C4-olefins.

[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock.
One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins.
Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes.
In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield.

The paper investigates the use of H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 zeolites for catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. H-ZSM-5 stands out due to its superior resistance to deactivation and higher propylene yield compared to the other two catalysts.
