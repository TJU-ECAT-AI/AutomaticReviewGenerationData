[1] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[2] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The H-ZSM-5 zeolite, particularly in its smaller crystal size form, proved to be the most effective catalyst for the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins, producing propylene. This catalyst showed superior stability over extended periods compared to its larger crystal size counterpart.
