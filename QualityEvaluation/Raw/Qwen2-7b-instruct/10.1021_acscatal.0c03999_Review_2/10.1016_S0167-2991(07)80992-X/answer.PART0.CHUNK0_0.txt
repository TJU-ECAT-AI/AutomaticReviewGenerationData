"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."

The study focuses on the catalytic performance of zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite, and SAPO-34 in the cracking of C4-olefin. It was discovered that the acid strength of these samples decreases in the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. Among these samples, H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the optimal catalyst for the production of propylene from C4-olefin cracking.

本文研究了氢化铝硅酸锌、氢莫登石和氢萨波-34在C4烯烃裂解中的催化性能。发现这些样品的酸强度依次为H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite，而稳定性则为H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite。其中，H-ZSM-5沸石被认为是最适合从C4烯烃裂解中生产丙烯的催化剂。
