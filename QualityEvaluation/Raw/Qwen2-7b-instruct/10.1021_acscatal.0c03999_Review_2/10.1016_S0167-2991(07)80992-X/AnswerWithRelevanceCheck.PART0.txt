          "Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
          "Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
          "It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
          "H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
          "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
          "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
          "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
          "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
          "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

          The research explores the use of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 for the catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. It was discovered that the acid strength of these samples decreases in the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic test follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. H-ZSM-5 zeolite was found to be the optimal catalyst for the production of propylene from C4-olefin cracking, and its stability increased with a smaller crystal size.

          研究探讨了H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34沸石在C4-烯烃裂解中的催化性能以产生丙烯。发现这些样品的酸强度依次为H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite，而它们在催化测试中的稳定性遵循H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite的顺序。H-ZSM-5沸石被证明是生产丙烯的最佳催化剂，且其稳定性随晶粒尺寸的减小而增加。
