[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream.

The study focused on the catalytic cracking of C4-olefin using zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 as catalysts. It was found that H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for producing propylene from C4-olefin cracking. The stability of the H-ZSM-5 catalyst increased with a smaller crystal size.
