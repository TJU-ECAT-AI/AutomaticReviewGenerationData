[1] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes."
[2] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
[3] "The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study focused on the catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefins over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34. These zeolites were synthesized using different directing agents and were evaluated for their performance in cracking reactions under high weight hourly space velocity. The researchers found that the acid strength of the samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-mordenite, while their stability in the catalytic tests followed the opposite order. H-ZSM-5 zeolite, especially when in smaller crystal size form, proved to be the most effective catalyst for producing propylene from C4-olefins.

本研究着重探讨了C4-烯烃在H-ZSM-5、H-莫登石和H-SAPO-34沸石上的催化裂解反应。这些沸石通过使用不同的导向剂合成，并在高重量小时空速下评估其裂解性能。研究人员发现，这些样品的酸强度按照H-SAPO-34 < H-ZSM-5 < H-莫登石的顺序排列，而它们在催化测试中的稳定性则相反。当H-ZSM-5为较小晶粒形式时，该沸石被证明是生产丙烯最有效的催化剂。
