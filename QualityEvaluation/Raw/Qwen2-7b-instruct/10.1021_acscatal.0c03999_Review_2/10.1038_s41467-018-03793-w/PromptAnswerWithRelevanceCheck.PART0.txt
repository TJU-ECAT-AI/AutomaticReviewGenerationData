[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas."
[2] "At that same reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. 1c, CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98% at a temperature 150 K less than that of methane dry reforming (DRM)."
[3] "Furthermore, in the CO2+C3H8 system unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + Cs 2CO) at temperatures as low as 773 K with moderate rates."
[4] "While there are studies that examine the CO2-ODHP or DRP separately, a thorough examination utilizing supported bimetallic catalysts at a temperature range that allows both pathways to occur is still lacking."
[5] "Results for conversions and product selectivity following time on stream for all catalysts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1."

1. Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Chromium-based systems often suffer from short lifecycles and high toxicity due to their limited ability to efficiently activate and oxidize CO2. By incorporating promoters, the catalysts can more effectively utilize CO2 as a mild oxidant, facilitating its activation and promoting the desired reactions. This approach avoids the drawbacks associated with using molecular oxygen, which can lead to over-oxidation and the production of carbon oxides. Instead, promoters enable the use of underutilized reactants, CO2 and propane, to produce valuable products like propylene or synthesis gas, thereby mitigating CO2 emissions.

2. The specific advantages of using promoters over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding include:
   - **Enhanced CO2 Activation:** Promoters improve the activation of CO2, allowing it to participate more effectively in the desired reactions without the need for high temperatures or additional oxygen sources.
   - **Increased Oxidizing Ability:** By modifying the catalyst surface properties, promoters can enhance the oxidizing capability of the catalyst, leading to more efficient conversion of CO2 and propane into desired products.
   - **Selective and Stable Performance:** The use of promoters enables the catalyst to maintain selective and stable performance over extended periods, reducing the risk of deactivation due to coking or phase transformations, which are common issues with high-temperature reactions involving CO2.

These benefits collectively contribute to more sustainable and economically viable processes for the conversion of CO2 and propane into valuable chemicals and fuels, while minimizing environmental impact.

Promoters, such as the incorporation of non-precious metals like iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) in bimetallic catalysts, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Specifically, these promoters allow for selective and stable catalytic performance in CO2 activation, leading to the production of propylene or syngas. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, these promoters enable a more efficient use of CO2 resources and achieve better selectivity towards desired products.
