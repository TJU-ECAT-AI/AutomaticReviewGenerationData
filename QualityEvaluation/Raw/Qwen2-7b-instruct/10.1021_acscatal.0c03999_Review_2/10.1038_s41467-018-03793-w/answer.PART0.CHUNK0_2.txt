[1] "The inherent variability and insufficiencies in the co-production of propylene from steam crackers has raised concerns regarding the global propylene production gap and has directed industry to develop more on-purpose propylene technologies."
[2] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
[3] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can reach an equilibrium conversion of 33% as opposed to 17% for DDP at 823 K."
[4] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has the potential to combine two underutilized46 reactants to pro- duce propylene or syngas."
[5] "The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2- ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."

Promoters, such as the incorporation of non-precious metals like iron (Fe) and nickel (Ni) in bimetallic catalysts, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Specifically, these promoters allow for selective and stable catalytic performance in CO2 activation, leading to the production of propylene or syngas. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, these promoters enable a more efficient use of CO2 resources and achieve better selectivity towards desired products. The use of Fe and Ni in bimetallic catalysts, particularly in the form of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, leads to improved activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP and DRP processes, respectively, by promoting the desired reaction pathways (CH bond scission for CO2-ODHP and CC bond cleavage for DRP) over competing pathways.

促进剂，如在双金属催化剂中引入非贵金属如铁（Fe）和镍（Ni），通过增强CO2的激活并提高其氧化能力，解决了CO2弱氧化潜能和惰性的问题。这些促进剂能够实现CO2激活的高效利用和更优的催化性能，从而生产丙烯或合成气。与氧共供给等替代策略相比，这些促进剂能够更有效地利用CO2资源，并实现对目标产物的更高选择性。Fe和Ni在双金属催化剂中的应用，特别是Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt的形式，在CO2-ODHP和DRP过程中表现出改进的活性和选择性，通过促进所需的反应途径（CO2-ODHP过程中的CH键断裂和DRP过程中的CC键断裂）超过竞争性途径。
