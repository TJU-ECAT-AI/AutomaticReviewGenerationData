[8] "The DFT calculation results indicate that the bulk Fe3Ni(111) surface and the FeO/Ni (111) interface should favor CH bond scission for the CO2-ODHP pathway, whereas the Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) surface should favor the CC bond cleavage for the DRP pathway."

Promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. They do this by facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, combining two underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. The presence of CO2 increases the equilibrium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction. CO2 acts as a mild oxidant, suppressing over-oxidation and minimizing the production of carbon oxides. The use of promoters allows for selective breaking of the CH or CC bonds, producing propylene or synthesis gas, respectively. The identification of bimetallic catalysts, particularly Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt, enables efficient CO2 utilization and selective production of desired products. In situ XANES measurements confirm the oxidized state of Fe in the Fe3Ni catalyst, indicating its role in promoting the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway.

在铬基催化剂系统中，促进剂通过增强二氧化碳的活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化潜力和惰性的限制。它们通过与二氧化碳结合，促进丙烷的氧化脱氢作用，将两个未充分利用的反应物结合起来生产丙烯或合成气。二氧化碳的存在增加了丙烷的平衡转化率，通过逆水煤气变换反应消耗氢气。二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，抑制过氧化作用，减少碳氧化物的生成。使用促进剂允许选择性地断裂CH或CC键，分别产生丙烯或合成气。已识别出两种双金属催化剂，尤其是Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt，能够有效地利用二氧化碳并选择性地生产所需产品。原位XANES测量证实了Fe3Ni催化剂中Fe的氧化状态，表明其在促进氧化脱氢途径中的作用。
