[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 (CO2-ODHP) can potentially fill this gap while consuming a greenhouse gas."
[2] "At that same reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. 1c, CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98% at a temperature 150 K less than that of methane dry reforming (DRM)."
[3] "Furthermore, in the CO2+C3H8 system unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + Cs 2CO) at temperatures as low as 773 K with moderate rates."
[4] "While there are studies that examine the CO2-ODHP or DRP separately, a thorough examination utilizing supported bimetallic catalysts at a temperature range that allows both pathways to occur is still lacking."
[5] "Results for conversions and product selectivity following time on stream for all catalysts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1."
[6] "Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts."
[7] "The XANES data identified that under reaction conditions the Ni3Pt catalyst consisted of metallic Pt (Supplementary Fig. 9) and that both the Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt catalysts consisted of metallic Ni (Fig. 3a)."
[8] "The DFT calculated binding energies were then used to calculate the change in energy for the oxidative CH and CC bond scission of propane."
[9] "According to the DFT calculations, on Pt-terminated-Ni3Pt(111),the *O insertion reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O *CH3CH2CH2O + *) along the CC bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.75 eV and Ea = 1.07 eV) is thermodynamically and kinetically more favorable than the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction (*CH3CH2CH2 + *O *CH3CHCH2 + *OH) along the CH bond cleavage pathway (ΔE = 0.51 eV and Ea = 1.33 eV)."

1. Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Chromium-based systems often suffer from short lifecycles and high toxicity due to their limited ability to efficiently activate and oxidize CO2. By incorporating promoters, the catalysts can more effectively utilize CO2 as a mild oxidant, facilitating its activation and promoting the desired reactions. This approach avoids the drawbacks associated with using molecular oxygen, which can lead to over-oxidation and the production of carbon oxides. Instead, promoters enable the use of underutilized reactants, CO2 and propane, to produce valuable products like propylene or synthesis gas, thereby mitigating CO2 emissions.

2. The specific advantages of using promoters over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding include:
   - **Enhanced CO2 Activation:** Promoters improve the activation of CO2, allowing it to participate more effectively in the desired reactions without the need for high temperatures or additional oxygen sources.
   - **Increased Oxidizing Ability:** By modifying the catalyst surface properties, promoters can enhance the oxidizing capability of the catalyst, leading to more efficient conversion of CO2 and propane into desired products.
   - **Selective and Stable Performance:** The use of promoters enables the catalyst to maintain selective and stable performance over extended periods, reducing the risk of deactivation due to coking or phase transformations, which are common issues with high-temperature reactions involving CO2.

These benefits collectively contribute to more sustainable and economically viable processes for the conversion of CO2 and propane into valuable chemicals and fuels, while minimizing environmental impact.

1. 助剂通过增强二氧化碳的活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化潜力和惰性的问题。在铬基催化剂系统中，由于其有限的能力来有效地活化和氧化二氧化碳，它们往往寿命短且毒性高。通过引入助剂，催化剂能够更有效地利用二氧化碳作为温和的氧化剂，促进其活化并促进所需反应。这种方法避免了使用分子氧所带来的缺点，后者可能导致过氧化和二氧化碳的产生。相反，助剂使可以利用未充分利用的反应物二氧化碳和丙烷生产有价值的产物如丙烯或合成气，从而减少二氧化碳排放。

2. 使用助剂相对于氧气共喂入等替代策略的优势包括：
   - **增强二氧化碳活化**：助剂改进了催化剂表面性质，使得二氧化碳能够更有效地参与所需的反应，而无需高温或额外的氧气来源。
   - **增加氧化能力**：通过修改催化剂表面特性，助剂可以增强催化剂的氧化能力，导致二氧化碳和丙烷更高效的转化成所需的产品。
   - **选择性和稳定性能**：使用助剂使催化剂能够保持选择性和稳定的性能，减少了由于结焦或相转变引起的催化剂失活的风险，这些都是涉及二氧化碳的高温反应常见的问题。

这些好处共同促成了更为可持续和经济可行的过程，用于将二氧化碳和丙烷转化为有价值的化学品和燃料，同时最小化环境影响。
