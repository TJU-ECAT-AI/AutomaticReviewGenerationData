[1] "Previous work in CO2-ODH primarily focuses on supported chromium catalysts1315 as a result of their ability to exist in multiple oxidation states16, but implementation is limited due to short lifecycles and high toxicity of chromium17."
[2] "Ni is mainly used for dry reforming, but catalyst deactivation due to severe coking is still a problem1820."
[3] "Fe3Ni shows promising selectivity toward propylene via the CO2-ODHP pathway, where Fe3Pt is active for the DRP with high selectivity toward CO."
[4] "The oxidation states of the different metals provided by in situ XANES measurements reveal that Fe3Ni consists of oxidized Fe and metallic Ni."

Promoters enhance CO2 activation and improve oxidizing ability by overcoming the weak oxidation potential and inertness of CO2 in chromium-based systems. They offer several advantages over strategies like O2 co-feeding. Specifically, they enable selective and stable catalytic performance without the risks associated with high chromium toxicity and severe coking issues encountered with nickel. By facilitating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, promoters allow for the efficient use of underutilized reactants to produce propylene or syngas. The combination of chromium and nickel in bimetallic systems provides a versatile platform for optimizing reaction pathways, with Fe3Ni favoring the CO2-ODHP pathway for propylene production and Ni3Pt being active for dry reforming with high CO selectivity.

促进剂通过克服CO2在铬基系统中的弱氧化电势和惰性，增强了CO2的激活能力和氧化能力。它们相对于O2共供等策略提供了一系列优势，特别是在避免高铬毒性以及镍引起的严重结焦问题方面。通过促进丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应，促进剂允许有效利用未充分利用的反应物来生产丙烯或合成气。双金属体系（如Fe3Ni和Ni3Pt）结合了铬和镍，提供了优化反应途径的灵活平台。Fe3Ni有利于CO2-ODHP途径以产生丙烯，而Ni3Pt则在干重整中表现出高CO选择性，同时实现了选择性和稳定性的催化性能。
