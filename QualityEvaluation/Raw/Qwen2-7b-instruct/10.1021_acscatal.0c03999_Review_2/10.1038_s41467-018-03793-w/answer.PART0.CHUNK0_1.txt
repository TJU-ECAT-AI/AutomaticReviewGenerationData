[1] "The inherent variability and insufficiencies in the co-production of propylene from steam crackers has raised concerns regarding the global propylene production gap and has directed industry to develop more on-purpose propylene technologies."
[2] "The presence of CO2 can also increase the equili- brium conversion of propane by consuming H2 through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), as seen in the thermo- dynamic calculations in Fig. 1a."
[3] "At that same reaction temperature, as seen in Fig. 1c, CO2 equilibrium conversion for the dry reforming of propane (DRP) can reach up to 98% at a temperature 150 K less than that of methane dry reforming (DRM)."
[4] "Furthermore, in the CO2+C3H8 system unreacted CO2 can remove surface carbon via the Boudouard reaction (CO2 + Cs 2CO) at temperatures as low as 773 K with moderate rates."
[5] "While there are studies that examine the CO2-ODHP or DRP separately, a thorough examination utilizing supported bimetallic catalysts at a temperature range that allows both pathways to occur is still lacking."
[6] "Ceria (CeO2) is a good choice of oxide support because it has the ability to store/release oxygen and thus may induce direct CO bond scission of CO2, while also providing available lattice oxygen for coke suppression."
[7] "Results for conversions and product selectivity following time on stream for all catalysts are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1."
[8] "The differences among the propylene yields on a C3H8 basis provided in Supplementary Table 1 of Fe3Ni (1.6% C3H6 yield) and the respective monometals (C3H6 yield of 0.4% over Ni and 0.2% over Fe) indicate that there is a synergistic effect from the formation of the bimetallic Fe3Ni catalyst."
[9] "Kinetic studies examining the influence of the reactant partial pressure and the reaction temperature on the activity of Fe3Ni and Ni3Pt were conducted to further evaluate the differences between the two types of catalysts."
[10] "As seen in Fig. 4a shows that the pathway for the oxidative CH bond cleavage lies lower in energy than that for the CC bond scission."

1. Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by increasing its activation, improving its oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. They allow CO2 to participate more effectively in reactions, particularly in the context of oxidative dehydrogenation and dry reforming, by facilitating the conversion of CO2 into more reactive intermediates. This approach offers advantages over alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding, which might require higher temperatures or could lead to over-oxidation and the production of unwanted byproducts. Promoters enable a more efficient use of resources, reduce emissions, and enhance the overall selectivity and stability of the catalytic processes involved.

2. The specific advantages of using promoters in CO2 activation and catalysis include:
   - **Increased Efficiency**: By enhancing the reactivity of CO2, promoters enable more efficient use of CO2 as a feedstock in industrial processes, contributing to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
   - **Selective Product Formation**: Promoters can be designed to selectively promote the formation of desired products, such as propylene, rather than unwanted byproducts like carbon oxides. This selectivity is crucial for achieving high yields of valuable chemical products.
   - **Stability and Durability**: Promoter addition can improve the stability and durability of catalysts, reducing the need for frequent regeneration or replacement, which is beneficial for long-term industrial operations.
   - **Cost-Effectiveness**: By optimizing the conversion of underutilized reactants, promoters contribute to cost-effective production methods, making them economically viable for industrial-scale applications.
   - **Environmental Impact Reduction**: Promoters facilitate the utilization of CO2, a potent greenhouse gas, in productive chemical processes, thereby mitigating environmental impacts associated with its emission.

Answer: 
1. Promoters in CO2 activation and catalysis offer several key advantages that address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness. They enhance CO2's activation, improve its oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance, leading to more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly chemical processes. Compared to alternative strategies such as oxygen co-feeding, promoters enable a more targeted and controlled transformation of CO2 into valuable products, reducing the generation of unwanted byproducts and lowering overall emissions.

2. The specific advantages of using promoters in CO2 activation and catalysis encompass increased efficiency, selective product formation, enhanced stability and durability of catalysts, cost-effectiveness, and a reduced environmental impact. These benefits collectively contribute to the development of sustainable and economically viable industrial processes that rely on CO2 as a feedstock.
