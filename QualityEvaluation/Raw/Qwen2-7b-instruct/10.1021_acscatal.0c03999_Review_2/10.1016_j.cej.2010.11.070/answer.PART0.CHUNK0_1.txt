[1] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
[2] "The selectivity to main product propylene was higher than 80% and as a main by-product it was produced another olefin ethylene."
[3] "Consequently, the yield of propylene was ca. 40% and higher for all studied catalysts with the chromium loading higher than 0.5 wt%."
[4] "Such a result superior the major part of the publicized data [15] and can be of the industrial interest."

Promoters enhance CO2 activation, improve oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance in chromium-based systems by allowing for high dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface. Metal vapor synthesis enables optimization of activity per chromium atom, leading to high selectivity towards propylene (over 80%) and ethylene as by-products. The yield of propylene is notably high, around 40% or more, for catalysts with chromium loadings greater than 0.5 wt%. These outcomes surpass many published results and hold industrial significance.

促进剂通过允许在二氧化硅表面上高度分散的铬物种，增强了二氧化碳的激活、提高了氧化能力，并实现了选择性和稳定的催化性能。金属蒸气合成技术使得每铬原子的活性优化，从而实现了丙烯（超过80%）和乙烯作为副产品的高选择性。丙烯的产率显著高，约为40%或更高，对于铬负载大于0.5 wt%的研究催化剂。这些结果超越了许多已发表的数据，并具有工业价值。
