[1] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of promoters enhances CO2 activation and improves oxidizing ability by creating surface chromate species and Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst. These sites contribute to coke production, especially at higher chromium contents. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters offer enhanced selectivity and stability due to their ability to specifically activate CO2 and generate active sites for the desired reactions.

促进剂通过在催化剂上形成表面铬酸盐物种和Brnsted酸中心来增强CO2激活并提高氧化能力。这些中心负责焦炭生产，尤其是在较高的铬含量下更为丰富。与共供给氧气等替代策略相比，促进剂提供了更高的选择性和稳定性，因为它们能够特异性地激活CO2并生成所需的反应活性位点。
