[1] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
[2] "The selectivity to main product propylene was higher than 80% and as a main by-product it was produced another olefin ethylene. Consequently, the yield of propylene was ca. 40% and higher for all studied catalysts with the chromium loading higher than 0.5 wt%."

Promoters enhance CO2 activation and improve oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems by allowing for the optimization of the system in terms of activity per chromium atom. They enable the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface, which leads to high selectivity for propylene production and high yield of propylene. This approach surpasses alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.
