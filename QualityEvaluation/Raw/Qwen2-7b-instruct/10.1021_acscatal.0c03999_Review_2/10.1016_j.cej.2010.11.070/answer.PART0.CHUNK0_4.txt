1. Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the oxidizing ability. They achieve selective and stable catalytic performance by promoting specific reactions, reducing side reactions, and maintaining the catalyst's activity over time. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters offer a more efficient use of resources since they specifically target CO2 activation, potentially leading to higher yields of desired products with lower energy consumption.

2. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique offers several advantages in optimizing chromium-based catalytic systems. It enables the precise control of chromium loading on the silica surface, leading to highly dispersed chromium species. This dispersion increases the number of active sites per unit of catalyst, thereby enhancing the activity of the catalyst. Moreover, MVS facilitates the preparation of catalysts with higher chromium loadings while maintaining their structural integrity and dispersion, which is crucial for achieving optimal catalytic performance.

3. The use of promoters in chromium-based catalysts results in a high selectivity towards propylene, with the selectivity exceeding 80%. Propylene is produced as the primary product, with ethylene serving as a secondary by-product. This selective production is advantageous as it ensures a high yield of propylene, which is often sought after in industrial applications.

4. The yield of propylene, calculated as a percentage of the total product, is notably higher than 40% for all catalysts studied with chromium loadings above 0.5 wt%. This high yield demonstrates the efficiency of the promoted catalysts in converting propane to propylene during oxidative dehydrogenation, even in the presence of CO2. The superior performance compared to published data highlights the potential of these catalysts for practical industrial applications.

5. The results obtained from the study show that the developed catalysts can significantly enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, leading to higher yields of propylene and ethylene. These findings are of industrial interest due to their potential for commercial application, offering a sustainable and efficient method for producing valuable hydrocarbons from renewable sources.
