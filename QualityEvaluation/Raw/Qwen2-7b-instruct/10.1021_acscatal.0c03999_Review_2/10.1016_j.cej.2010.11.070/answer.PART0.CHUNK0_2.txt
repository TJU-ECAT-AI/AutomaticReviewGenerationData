[1] "In the present work catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
[2] "This method let to obtain on the catalyst surface a high dispersed chromium species even at high chromium loadings."
[3] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
[4] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."

1. Metal vapor synthesis is utilized to enhance the activation of CO2 and improve the oxidizing capability in chromium-based catalytic systems. This method enables the creation of highly dispersed chromium species on the catalyst surface, which leads to enhanced selectivity and stability compared to traditional approaches like oxygen co-feeding.
