<p>The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen.</p>
<p>Such results suggest that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions are reoxidized by carbon dioxide to Cr6+ ions, is not the effective way of propene formation.</p>
<p>Cr3+O- + H2 = Cr2+ + H2O</p>
<p>Cr2+ + CO2 = Cr3+O- + CO</p>

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving its oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. They do this by facilitating a redox cycle on the surface of silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts. This cycle involves hydrogen reducing Cr3+ to Cr2+ species (equation 1) and then reoxidizing Cr2+ by CO2 (equation 2). This bi-functional behavior allows for more efficient propane dehydrogenation and propene production compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding.

促进剂通过增强二氧化碳的活化、提高其氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化潜能和惰性在铬基催化剂系统中的限制。它们通过在二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂表面实现一个氧化还原循环来实现这一目标。这个循环涉及氢将Cr3+还原为Cr2+物种（等式1）以及通过CO2对Cr2+的再氧化（等式2）。这种双功能行为允许更有效地进行丙烷脱氢和丙烯生成，相比与氧气共供给的替代策略。
