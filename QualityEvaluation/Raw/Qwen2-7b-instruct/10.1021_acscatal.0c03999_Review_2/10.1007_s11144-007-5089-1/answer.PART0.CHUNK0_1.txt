[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6-14]. It has been found that in this process CO2 acts not only as a diluent and a heating medium but also as an oxidant."
[2] "Over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."
[3] "Such redox behaviour of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts may explain the previous observations [6,8], which reveal that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene decreases with increasing Cr content."
[4] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."
[5] "This bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst may be responsible for higher propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2."

Promoters, such as CO2, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving its oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, CO2 acts as an oxidant, facilitating the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene depends on the chromium loading; it rises with decreasing Cr content, indicating a synergistic effect between CO2 and chromium. The redox behavior of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts explains how CO2 can effectively participate in the dehydrogenation process. The DRS results demonstrate that CO2's reoxidation efficiency is lower compared to oxygen, suggesting indirect pathways for propene formation. The bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst enables higher propane conversion and propene yield when CO2 is present, contributing to enhanced catalytic performance.
