[1] "Over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmosphere, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content."
[2] "Such redox behaviour of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts may explain the previous observations, which reveal that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene decreases with increasing Cr content."
[3] "CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."
[4] "The bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst may be responsible for higher propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by maintaining selective and stable catalytic performance. The bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, which allows it to act in both the dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions, contributes to higher propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2. The promoters' effectiveness in overcoming CO2's inherent weaknesses lies in their ability to facilitate a more efficient redox cycle, allowing for better utilization of CO2 in the catalytic process.
