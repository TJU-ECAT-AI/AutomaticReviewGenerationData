[1] "As we found previously [21], the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is active both in the dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions."
[2] "This bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst may be responsible for higher propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2."
[3] "Over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmosphere, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content [6,8]."
[4] "Such redox behaviour of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts may explain the previous observations [6,8], which reveal that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene decreases with increasing Cr content."
[5] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."
[6] "Such results suggest that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions are reoxidized by carbon dioxide to Cr6+ ions, is not the effective way of propene formation."

Promoters like CO2 address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by leveraging their dual functionality. They enable higher propane conversion and propene yield, particularly at lower chromium loadings, by facilitating a redox cycle involving the reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ species, followed by reoxidation by CO2. This bi-functional behavior of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, where it actively participates in both dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions, contributes to its enhanced performance in the presence of CO2. The promoters offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, including improved CO2 activation, stronger oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. The redox behavior of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts explains why the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield decreases with increasing Cr content. CO2, however, is a less efficient oxidant compared to oxygen, indicating that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2 is not an effective way to form propene.

促进剂如二氧化碳通过利用其双功能性质，解决了二氧化碳氧化能力较弱和惰性的局限性。它们能够提高丙烷转化率和丙烯产率，尤其是在较低铬含量的情况下，通过使Cr3+还原为Cr2+物种，随后由二氧化碳进行再氧化来促进这一过程。CrOx/SiO2催化剂的这种双重功能特性，它同时参与脱氢反应和水煤气逆向变换（RWGS）反应，有助于其在二氧化碳存在下的增强性能。与氧气共给相比，促进剂提供了改进CO2激活、更强氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能的具体优势。SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂的还原行为解释了为什么随着铬含量的增加，二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进作用会减弱。然而，二氧化碳作为氧化剂的效率远低于氧气，这表明直接通过二氧化碳氧化脱氢丙烷形成丙烯并非有效的丙烯形成方式。
