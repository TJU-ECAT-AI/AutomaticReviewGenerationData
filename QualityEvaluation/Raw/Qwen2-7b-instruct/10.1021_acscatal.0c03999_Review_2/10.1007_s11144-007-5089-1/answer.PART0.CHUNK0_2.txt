<p>The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen.</p>
<p>Such results suggest that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions are reoxidized by carbon dioxide to Cr6+ ions, is not the effective way of propene formation.</p>
<p>This bi-functional character of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst may be responsible for higher propane conversion and propene yield in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>Cr3+O- + H2 = Cr2+ + H2O</p>
<p>Cr2+ + CO2 = Cr3+O- + CO</p>

Promoters like CO2 address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving its oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. They do this by facilitating a redox cycle on the surface of the catalyst. In this cycle, hydrogen formed in the dehydrogenation of propane reduces Cr3+ to Cr2+ species, and in the next step, these species are reoxidized by CO2. This bi-functional behavior of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst explains how it can efficiently convert propane and yield propene selectively and stably in the presence of CO2.

促进剂如二氧化碳通过增强二氧化碳的激活、提高其氧化能力并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化潜力和惰性在铬基催化剂系统中的限制。它们通过在催化剂表面促进一个氧化还原循环来实现这一点。在这个循环中，丙烷脱氢产生的氢将Cr3+还原为Cr2+物种，然后这些物种在下一步被二氧化碳重新氧化。这种CrOx/SiO2催化剂的双功能特性解释了它如何能够有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，并以选择性和稳定的方式获得丙烯。
