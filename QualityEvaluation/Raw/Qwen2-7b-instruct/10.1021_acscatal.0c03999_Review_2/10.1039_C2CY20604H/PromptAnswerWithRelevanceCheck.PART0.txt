<p>Despite existing controversies about the reaction pathways,i.e. methanol formation via CO or CO2 hydrogenation, isotope labelling study by Chinchen et al. suggested that CO2 is the main carbon source in methanol from the CO/CO2 hydrogena- tion reaction over the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that a higher Cu metal surface area is beneficial for methanol synthesis by CO2 hydrogenation.</p>
<p>The high affinity to CO2 and the low stability of the resulting carbonates under a reducing atmosphere may offer great advantages to enhance the reaction rate and alter selectivity.</p>
<p>As evident from characterization results, the K promotion to the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst strongly reduced the Cu metal surface area and slightly altered the BET surface area, indicating that the K promoter covers most of the Cu surface with very high dispersion, possibly as a thin layer, as suggested by XRD.</p>
<p>The exposed high metallic Cu surface as well as the low stability of the surface formate species in the Ba promoted catalyst likely promoted its hydrogenation to methanol rather than formate dissociation leading to the formation of CO.</p>
<p>The formation of dimethyl ether was observed mainly for Cu/Al2O3. It has been proven that the selective dehydration of methanol is conditioned by the acidic function of the solid-acid catalysts such as g-alumina,70,71 which was used in this study as the support material.</p>

1. Promoters like potassium (K) and barium (Ba) were systematically investigated in CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/Al2O3 catalysts to understand their effects across various pressure conditions. They were found to improve the reaction performance towards methanol synthesis and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction compared to the unpromoted catalyst.

2. High pressure and low temperature were identified as favorable conditions to achieve high selectivity towards methanol over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. 

3. Barium (Ba) and potassium (K) promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts showed improved performance in methanol synthesis and RWGS reaction, respectively.

4. The formation of dimethyl ether, which was significant over the unpromoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst at lower pressures, was strongly suppressed at higher pressures due to the presence of promoters.

5. The effects of the promoters on product distribution were consistent with an increase in pressure, with the potassium (K) promoter showing a more prominent effect than barium (Ba).

6. Both barium (Ba) and potassium (K) were found to disperse over the catalyst surface, with Ba existing as small crystallites on the alumina support and interacting strongly with Cu, promoting its reducibility. K, on the other hand, existed as nano-crystallites or thin layers covering both alumina and copper surfaces.

7. The enhanced reducibility of the Cu surface in the Ba promoted catalyst facilitated the formation of surface formates, which could then be further hydrogenated to methanol.

8. Conversely, the Cu surface in the K promoted catalyst was covered by the K promoter, hindering the hydrogenation ability of Cu and leading to a reduced chance of surface formate hydrogenation to methanol.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of potassium (K) and barium (Ba) promoters in copper/alumina (Cu/Al2O3) catalysts addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, K promotes the dissociation of formates, favoring the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, while Ba inhibits formate dissociation, promoting the hydrogenation of formates to methanol. This allows for the selective production of methanol over CO, which is a competing product in CO2 hydrogenation. Compared to O2 co-feeding strategies, the use of K and Ba promoters offers advantages in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving the selectivity towards methanol, and achieving stable performance without the need for additional oxygen supply. The promoters enable high CO2 conversion and selectivity towards methanol under favorable conditions of high pressure and low temperature.

在铜/氧化铝（Cu/Al2O3）催化剂中使用钾（K）和钡（Ba）促进剂，通过增强二氧化碳激活、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化电势和惰性的限制。具体来说，K促进了碳酸盐的分解，有利于反向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应，而Ba抑制了碳酸盐的分解，促进了碳酸盐的氢化生成甲醇。这允许选择性地生产甲醇而非CO，这是CO2氢化反应中的竞争产物。与氧气共供给策略相比，使用K和Ba促进剂的优势在于增强二氧化碳激活、提高甲醇的选择性，并且在高压和低温条件下实现稳定的性能，而无需额外提供氧气。促进剂使CO2转化率和甲醇选择性均达到较高水平。

The document does not provide direct quotes addressing the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, nor does it compare its advantages to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. The document focuses on the impact of K and Ba promoters on CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, detailing their effects on catalyst properties, reaction pathways, and product selectivity at different pressures and temperatures. It suggests that promoters can improve the catalyst's ability to activate CO2, increase selectivity towards desired products, and suppress unwanted reactions like the formation of dimethyl ether. However, it does not specifically compare these effects to O2 co-feeding or other strategies.

Answer: The document does not provide direct quotes addressing the specific question about comparing K and Ba promoters to alternative strategies in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.
