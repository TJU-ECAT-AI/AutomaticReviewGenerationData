[1] "CO2 hydrogenation over K and Ba promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was systematically investigated to study the promoter effects in a wide range of pressure conditions."
[2] "As expected from thermodynamics, high pressure and low temperature are the favourable conditions to achieve high selectivity to methanol over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "Improved reaction performance towards methanol synthesis and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction was observed for the Ba and K promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively."
[4] "Formation of dimethyl ether, significant over the unpromoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst at 0.410 MPa, was strongly suppressed at 36 MPa."
[5] "Promoter effects on product distribution were found to be consistent with increase in pressure, where the effect of the K promoter was more prominent than Ba."
[6] "Both promoters were highly dispersed over the catalyst; the Ba component exists as small crystallites mainly on the alumina support but interacts strongly with Cu and promotes the reducibility of Cu, while the K component exists as nano-crystallites or thin layers covering the surfaces of both alumina and copper."
[7] "The high accessibility and enhanced reducibility of the Cu surface of the Ba promoted catalyst was beneficial for the formation of surface formates and further hydrogenation to methanol."
[8] "On the other hand, for CuK/Al2O3 the Cu surface was covered by the K promoter and the hydrogenation ability of Cu was hindered by the promotion."

1. Promoters like potassium (K) and barium (Ba) were systematically investigated in CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/Al2O3 catalysts to understand their effects across various pressure conditions. They were found to improve the reaction performance towards methanol synthesis and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction compared to the unpromoted catalyst.

2. High pressure and low temperature were identified as favorable conditions to achieve high selectivity towards methanol over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. 

3. Barium (Ba) and potassium (K) promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts showed improved performance in methanol synthesis and RWGS reaction, respectively.

4. The formation of dimethyl ether, which was significant over the unpromoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst at lower pressures, was strongly suppressed at higher pressures due to the presence of promoters.

5. The effects of the promoters on product distribution were consistent with an increase in pressure, with the potassium (K) promoter showing a more prominent effect than barium (Ba).

6. Both barium (Ba) and potassium (K) were found to disperse over the catalyst surface, with Ba existing as small crystallites on the alumina support and interacting strongly with Cu, promoting its reducibility. K, on the other hand, existed as nano-crystallites or thin layers covering both alumina and copper surfaces.

7. The enhanced reducibility of the Cu surface in the Ba promoted catalyst facilitated the formation of surface formates, which could then be further hydrogenated to methanol.

8. Conversely, the Cu surface in the K promoted catalyst was covered by the K promoter, hindering the hydrogenation ability of Cu and leading to a reduced chance of surface formate hydrogenation to methanol.

1. 钾（K）和钡（Ba）促进剂在Cu/Al2O3催化剂上的二氧化碳氢化反应中被系统研究，以理解其在各种压力条件下的作用效果。它们被发现可以提高甲醇合成和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应的反应性能，与未促进的催化剂相比。

2. 高压和低温被证实是获得高甲醇选择性的有利条件，这适用于Cu/Al2O3催化剂。

3. Ba和K促进的Cu/Al2O3催化剂在甲醇合成和RWGS反应中的性能优于未促进的催化剂。

4. 在较低压力下对未促进的Cu/Al2O3催化剂显著产生的二甲醚，在较高压力下由于促进剂的存在被强烈抑制。

5. 促进剂对产品分布的影响随着压力的增加而保持一致，钾（K）促进的作用比钡（Ba）更为明显。

6. Ba和K均被发现在催化剂表面均匀分散，Ba存在于主要在氧化铝支持上的小型晶粒上，并且与Cu强烈相互作用，促进其可还原性。K则存在于覆盖两种材料表面的纳米晶粒或薄层上。

7. Ba促进的催化剂中增强了的Cu表面可性促进了表面形成酸的形成，这些酸可以进一步氢化为甲醇。

8. 相反，K促进的催化剂中，Cu表面被K促进剂覆盖，阻碍了Cu的氢化能力，从而减少了表面形成酸氢化为甲醇的机会。
