[1] "CO2 hydrogenation over K and Ba promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst was systematically investigated to study the promoter effects in a wide range of pressure conditions."
[2] "As expected from thermodynamics, high pressure and low temperature are the favourable conditions to achieve high selectivity to methanol over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The influence of promoters on the formation of surface species present during the reaction was examined by in situ DRIFTS."
[4] "The addition of the K promoter enhances the formate dissociation capability, whereas the addition of the Ba promoter inhibits the dissociation process or promotes the formate hydrogenation process."

The use of potassium (K) and barium (Ba) promoters in copper/alumina (Cu/Al2O3) catalysts addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, K promotes the dissociation of formates, favoring the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction, while Ba inhibits formate dissociation, promoting the hydrogenation of formates to methanol. This allows for the selective production of methanol over CO, which is a competing product in CO2 hydrogenation. Compared to O2 co-feeding strategies, the use of K and Ba promoters offers advantages in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving the selectivity towards methanol, and achieving stable performance without the need for additional oxygen supply. The promoters enable high CO2 conversion and selectivity towards methanol under favorable conditions of high pressure and low temperature.

在铜/氧化铝（Cu/Al2O3）催化剂中使用钾（K）和钡（Ba）促进剂，通过增强二氧化碳激活、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化电势和惰性的限制。具体来说，K促进了碳酸盐的分解，有利于反向水煤气变换（RWGS）反应，而Ba抑制了碳酸盐的分解，促进了碳酸盐的氢化生成甲醇。这允许选择性地生产甲醇而非CO，这是CO2氢化反应中的竞争产物。与氧气共供给策略相比，使用K和Ba促进剂的优势在于增强二氧化碳激活、提高甲醇的选择性，并且在高压和低温条件下实现稳定的性能，而无需额外提供氧气。促进剂使CO2转化率和甲醇选择性均达到较高水平。
