1. Chinchen et al.'s isotope labelling study suggested that CO2 serves as the primary carbon source in methanol production through CO/CO2 hydrogenation over the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst.
2. Increasing the copper metal surface area benefits methanol synthesis through CO2 hydrogenation.
3. The high affinity for CO2 and the low stability of resulting carbonates under a reducing atmosphere offer significant advantages in enhancing reaction rates and altering selectivity.
4. The potassium promoter significantly reduces the copper metal surface area and slightly alters the BET surface area, suggesting that the potassium promoter covers most of the copper surface with high dispersion, potentially as a thin layer, as indicated by XRD.
5. The exposed high copper metal surface and the low stability of surface formate species in the barium-promoted catalyst likely promote hydrogenation to methanol rather than formate dissociation, resulting in the formation of CO.
6. The formation of dimethyl ether is primarily observed for Cu/Al2O3, and this process is conditioned by the acidic function of solid-acid catalysts like g-alumina, which was utilized in this study as the support material.
7. The formation of dimethyl ether is mainly observed for Cu/Al2O3, and this is influenced by the acidic function of solid-acid catalysts such as g-alumina, which was used in this study as the support material.
8. It is hypothesized that the barium component remains in a hydroxide state, temporarily forming carbonates, during the reaction.
9. The enhanced accessibility and improved reducibility of the copper surface in the barium-promoted catalyst facilitate the formation of surface formates and subsequent hydrogenation to methanol.
