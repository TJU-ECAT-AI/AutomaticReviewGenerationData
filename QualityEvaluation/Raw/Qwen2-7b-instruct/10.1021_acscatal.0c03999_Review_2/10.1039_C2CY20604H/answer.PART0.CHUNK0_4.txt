<p>Despite controversies about the reaction pathways, isotope labelling study by Chinchen et al. suggested that CO2 is the main carbon source in methanol from the CO/CO2 hydrogenation reaction over the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>High pressure and low temperature are the favourable conditions to achieve high selectivity to methanol over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst.</p>
<p>Improved reaction performance towards methanol synthesis and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction was observed for the Ba and K promoted Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.</p>
<p>Formation of dimethyl ether, significant over the unpromoted Cu/Al2O3 catalyst at 0.410 MPa, was strongly suppressed at 36 MPa.</p>
<p>The addition of the K promoter enhances the formate dissociation capability, whereas the addition of the Ba promoter inhibits the dissociation process or promotes the formate hydrogenation process.</p>
<p>Both promoters were highly dispersed over the catalyst; the Ba component exists as small crystallites mainly on the alumina support but interacts strongly with Cu and promotes the reducibility of Cu, while the K component exists as nano-crystallites or thin layers covering the surfaces of both alumina and copper.</p>
<p>The high accessibility and enhanced reducibility of the Cu surface of the Ba promoted catalyst was beneficial for the formation of surface formates and further hydrogenation to methanol.</p>
<p>The K promoter covers most of the Cu surface with very high dispersion, possibly as a thin layer, as suggested by XRD. The shifting to higher temperatures of the two peaks for the reduction of CuO in H2-TPR and also of peak (I) in CO2-TPD of the CuK/Al2O3 catalyst compared to those of the unpromoted one indicates hindering of the reduction process and thus low hydrogenation activity of Cu, possibly due to the coverage of the K promoter over the Cu surface.</p>

The document does not provide direct quotes addressing the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, nor does it compare its advantages to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. The document focuses on the impact of K and Ba promoters on CO2 hydrogenation over Cu/Al2O3 catalysts, detailing their effects on catalyst properties, reaction pathways, and product selectivity at different pressures and temperatures. It suggests that promoters can improve the catalyst's ability to activate CO2, increase selectivity towards desired products, and suppress unwanted reactions like the formation of dimethyl ether. However, it does not specifically compare these effects to O2 co-feeding or other strategies.

Answer: The document does not provide direct quotes addressing the specific question about comparing K and Ba promoters to alternative strategies in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

文档没有直接引用关于比较K和Ba促进剂与替代策略在增强CO2活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能方面的优势的语句。文档主要关注在Cu/Al2O3催化剂上通过添加K和Ba促进剂进行CO2氢化的影响，详细描述了在不同压力和温度下催化剂性质、反应途径和产品选择性的影响。它表明促进剂可以改善催化剂激活CO2的能力，增加向所需产品的选择性，并抑制如二甲醚形成等不希望发生的反应。然而，它并没有具体比较这些效果与氧气共供给或其他策略的效果。

答案：文档没有提供关于具体比较K和Ba促进剂与替代策略在增强CO2活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能方面的优势的直接引文。
