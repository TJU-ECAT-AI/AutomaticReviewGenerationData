[1] "High pressure and low temperature are the favourable conditions to achieve high selectivity to methanol over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst."
[2] "Potassium and barium promotion had a great influence on the selection of the CO2 hydrogenation pathways. K and Ba promotion enhanced CO and methanol selectivity, respectively."
[3] "A further increase in pressure to 36 MPa resulted in the observation of a good amount of methyl formate along with methanol for CuBa/Al2O3, which was explained by the unique combination of the high methanol production and the modified surface acid-base property given by the Ba promotion."

1. High pressure and low temperature are beneficial conditions for achieving high selectivity to methanol over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst. 
2. Promoters like potassium and barium significantly influence the CO2 hydrogenation pathways, enhancing CO and methanol selectivity respectively.
3. An increase in pressure to 36 MPa for CuBa/Al2O3 led to the production of methyl formate alongside methanol, attributed to the high methanol production and modified surface acid-base property from the Ba promoter.

1. 高压和低温是实现Cu/Al2O3催化剂甲醇高选择性的有利条件。
2. 钾和钡等促进剂对CO2氢化路径具有重大影响，分别增强了一氧化碳和甲醇的选择性。
3. 将压力增加到36 MPa时，CuBa/Al2O3产生了甲基甲酸酯与甲醇，这是由Ba促进剂带来的高甲醇生产率和表面酸碱性质改变所导致的。
