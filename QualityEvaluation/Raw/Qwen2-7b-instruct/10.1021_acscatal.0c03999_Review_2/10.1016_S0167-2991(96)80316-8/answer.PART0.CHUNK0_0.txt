[1] "For the tested rare earth vanadates as well as for the niobium. promoted catalysts an enhancement of the C3H6 selectivity at isoconversion and thus of the C3H6 yields is observed upon C02 addition into the feed."
[2] "It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates 1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure"
[3] "The aim of the present work is to study the second possibility and to optimize the feed composition of the oxidative propane dehydrogenation on rare earth vanadates."

The literature indicates that promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the catalyst's oxidizing ability. Specifically, they block basic oxidizing sites on the catalyst surface through interaction with other oxides such as Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a. This strategy allows for selective and stable catalytic performance by optimizing the feed composition, leading to increased C3H6 selectivity and yields during oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

文献表明，通过促进剂增强CO2的氧化潜力和提高催化剂的氧化能力，可以解决铬基催化系统中CO2弱氧化电势和惰性的问题。具体而言，它们通过与其他氧化物（如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a）相互作用来阻塞催化剂表面的基本氧化位点，如稀土氧化物位点。这一策略通过优化进料组成，使得在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中能够实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，从而提高C3H6的选择性和产率。
