[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is always in competition with the total oxidation of propane or of the formed propene producing CO and C02 as shown in the following scheme:1/202 -------------,l.
C3H6"
[2] "In most of the experiments an increase of selectivity and a decrease of activity were observed, but the selectivity at isoconversion remains constant and the CaH6 yield is never significantly enhanced."
[3] "It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates 1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure [S]"
[4] "2- by the addition of C02 into the feed, the absorption - desorption equilibrium of C02 on the surface, probably on the basic oxidation sites,decreasing thus the amount of molecular oxygen which is believed to be responsible for the total oxidation of propane."

The limitation of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems can be addressed by promoting the catalyst with other oxides like Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a. These promoters react with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure, effectively blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface. This approach enhances CO2 activation and improves the catalyst's oxidizing ability compared to traditional methods such as increasing O2 feeding rate or contact time. Moreover, the addition of CO2 into the feed shifts the equilibrium towards CO2 adsorption and desorption on the catalyst surface, likely on the basic oxidation sites, thereby reducing the amount of molecular oxygen available for total oxidation of propane. This results in improved selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance.

在铬基催化剂系统中，CO2的弱氧化潜力和惰性可以通过促进催化剂与其他氧化物如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a结合来解决。这些促进剂与结构中未参与的稀土氧化物反应，有效阻断催化表面的基本氧化位点。这种方法增强了CO2的活化和催化剂的氧化能力，相比传统的增加氧气供应量或接触时间等方法具有优势。此外，向反应物中添加CO2导致CO2在催化剂表面上的吸附-脱附平衡，很可能发生在基本氧化位点上，从而减少了用于完全氧化丙烷的分子氧的数量。这提高了选择性和催化性能的稳定性。
