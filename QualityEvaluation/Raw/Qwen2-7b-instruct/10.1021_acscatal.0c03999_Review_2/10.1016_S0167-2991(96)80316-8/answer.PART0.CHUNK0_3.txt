[1] "The aim of the present work is to study the second possibility and to optimize the feed composition of the oxidative propane dehydrogenation on rare earth vanadates."
[2] "In order to diminish the unavoidable total oxidation, most of the authors working on various catalytic systems propose to modify the reaction conditions: decrease of the 02/CaHs ratio, of the contact time and/or the reaction temperature."
[3] "It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates 1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure [S]"
[4] "2- by the addition of C02 into the feed, the absorption - desorption equilibrium of C02 on the surface, probably on the basic oxidation sites, decreasing thus the amount of molecular oxygen which is believed to be responsible for the total oxidation of propane."

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters are used. Specifically, by promoting the catalyst with other oxides such as Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a, the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface, typically the rare earth oxide sites, can be blocked. This enhances CO2 activation, improves the oxidizing ability, and achieves selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, this method optimizes the feed composition for oxidative propane dehydrogenation on rare earth vanadates. The addition of CO2 into the feed creates an absorption-desorption equilibrium, which likely decreases the amount of molecular oxygen responsible for the total oxidation of propane, thus improving the selectivity and yield of propane dehydrogenation.

为了应对二氧化碳氧化能力较弱和惰性的限制在铬基催化系统中，使用促进剂。具体来说，通过用其他氧化物（如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a）促进催化剂，可以阻塞催化表面的基本氧化位点，通常是稀土氧化物位点。这可以增强二氧化碳的活化、提高氧化能力，并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。与替代策略如氧气共供给相比，这种方法优化了丙烷氧化脱氢反应中稀有地球钨酸盐的进料组成。向进料中添加二氧化碳会在表面上形成吸附-解吸平衡，可能减少了被认为是导致丙烷完全氧化的主要分子氧含量，从而提高了丙烷脱氢的选择性和产率。
