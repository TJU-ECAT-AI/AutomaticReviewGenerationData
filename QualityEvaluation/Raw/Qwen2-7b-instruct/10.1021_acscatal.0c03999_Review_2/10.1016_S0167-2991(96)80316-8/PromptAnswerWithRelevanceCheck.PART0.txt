[1] "For the tested rare earth vanadates as well as for the niobium. promoted catalysts an enhancement of the C3H6 selectivity at isoconversion and thus of the C3H6 yields is observed upon C02 addition into the feed."
[2] "It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates 1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure"
[3] "The aim of the present work is to study the second possibility and to optimize the feed composition of the oxidative propane dehydrogenation on rare earth vanadates."

The literature indicates that promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the catalyst's oxidizing ability. Specifically, they block basic oxidizing sites on the catalyst surface through interaction with other oxides such as Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a. This strategy allows for selective and stable catalytic performance by optimizing the feed composition, leading to increased C3H6 selectivity and yields during oxidative dehydrogenation processes.

文献表明，通过促进剂增强CO2的氧化潜力和提高催化剂的氧化能力，可以解决铬基催化系统中CO2弱氧化电势和惰性的问题。具体而言，它们通过与其他氧化物（如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a）相互作用来阻塞催化剂表面的基本氧化位点，如稀土氧化物位点。这一策略通过优化进料组成，使得在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中能够实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，从而提高C3H6的选择性和产率。

[2] "In most of the experiments an increase of selectivity and a decrease of activity were observed, but the selectivity at isoconversion remains constant and the CaH6 yield is never significantly enhanced."
[3] "It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates 1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure [S]"

The limitation of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems can be addressed by promoting the catalyst with other oxides like Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a. These promoters react with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure, effectively blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface. This approach enhances CO2 activation and improves the catalyst's oxidizing ability compared to traditional methods such as increasing O2 feeding rate or contact time. Moreover, the addition of CO2 into the feed shifts the equilibrium towards CO2 adsorption and desorption on the catalyst surface, likely on the basic oxidation sites, thereby reducing the amount of molecular oxygen available for total oxidation of propane. This results in improved selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance.

在铬基催化剂系统中，CO2的弱氧化潜力和惰性可以通过促进催化剂与其他氧化物如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a结合来解决。这些促进剂与结构中未参与的稀土氧化物反应，有效阻断催化表面的基本氧化位点。这种方法增强了CO2的活化和催化剂的氧化能力，相比传统的增加氧气供应量或接触时间等方法具有优势。此外，向反应物中添加CO2导致CO2在催化剂表面上的吸附-脱附平衡，很可能发生在基本氧化位点上，从而减少了用于完全氧化丙烷的分子氧的数量。这提高了选择性和催化性能的稳定性。

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters are used. Specifically, by promoting the catalyst with other oxides such as Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a, the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface, typically the rare earth oxide sites, can be blocked. This enhances CO2 activation, improves the oxidizing ability, and achieves selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, this method optimizes the feed composition for oxidative propane dehydrogenation on rare earth vanadates. The addition of CO2 into the feed creates an absorption-desorption equilibrium, which likely decreases the amount of molecular oxygen responsible for the total oxidation of propane, thus improving the selectivity and yield of propane dehydrogenation.

The document explains that promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface. This is achieved through promoting the catalyst with other oxides such as Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a. These additives react with the rare earth oxide, effectively reducing the amount of molecular oxygen available for the total oxidation of propane. By decreasing the molecular oxygen, the formation of CO and C02 is diminished, allowing for enhanced selectivity towards propane dehydrogenation.

Additionally, the addition of CO2 into the feed is another method to improve the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The absorption-desorption equilibrium of CO2 on the surface, particularly on the basic oxidation sites, reduces the amount of molecular oxygen responsible for the total oxidation of propane, thus improving the selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance.

文档说明，通过在催化剂表面阻塞基本氧化位点，可以解决CO2弱氧化电势和惰性的限制。这可以通过用其他氧化物如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a促进催化剂来实现。这些添加剂与非结构参与的稀土氧化物反应，有效减少了分子氧的含量，进而减少丙烷的完全氧化。

另外，将CO2添加到原料中是另一种提高丙烷脱氢氧化的方法。CO2在表面上的吸附-解吸平衡，特别是在基本氧化位点上，减少了负责丙烷完全氧化的分子氧含量，从而提高了选择性和催化性能的稳定性。
