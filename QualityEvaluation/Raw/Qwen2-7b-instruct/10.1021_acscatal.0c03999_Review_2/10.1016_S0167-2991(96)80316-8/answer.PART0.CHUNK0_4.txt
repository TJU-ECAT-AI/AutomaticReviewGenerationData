[1] "It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates 1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure"
[2] "2- by the addition of C02 into the feed, the absorption - desorption equilibrium of C02 on the surface, probably on the basic oxidation sites,decreasing thus the amount of molecular oxygen which is believed to be responsible for the total oxidation of propane."

The document explains that promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface. This is achieved through promoting the catalyst with other oxides such as Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a. These additives react with the rare earth oxide, effectively reducing the amount of molecular oxygen available for the total oxidation of propane. By decreasing the molecular oxygen, the formation of CO and C02 is diminished, allowing for enhanced selectivity towards propane dehydrogenation.

Additionally, the addition of CO2 into the feed is another method to improve the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The absorption-desorption equilibrium of CO2 on the surface, particularly on the basic oxidation sites, reduces the amount of molecular oxygen responsible for the total oxidation of propane, thus improving the selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance.

文档说明，通过在催化剂表面阻塞基本氧化位点，可以解决CO2弱氧化电势和惰性的限制。这可以通过用其他氧化物如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a促进催化剂来实现。这些添加剂与非结构参与的稀土氧化物反应，有效减少了分子氧的含量，进而减少丙烷的完全氧化。

另外，将CO2添加到原料中是另一种提高丙烷脱氢氧化的方法。CO2在表面上的吸附-解吸平衡，特别是在基本氧化位点上，减少了负责丙烷完全氧化的分子氧含量，从而提高了选择性和催化性能的稳定性。
