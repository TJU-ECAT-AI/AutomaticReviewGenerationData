[1] "In order to diminish the unavoidable total oxidation, most of the authors working on various catalytic systems propose to modify the reaction conditions: decrease of the O2/CaHs ratio, of the contact time and/or the reaction temperature."
[2] "It was found, in our laboratory, that the formation of CaH6 at a given conversion can be improved by two different means for rare earth vanadates"
[3] "1- by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface (e.g. rare earth oxide sites) by promotion of the catalyst with another oxide like Nb205, MoOa or Bi20a which reacts with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure"
[4] "2- by the addition of CO2 into the feed, the absorption - desorption equilibrium of CO2 on the surface, probably on the basic oxidation sites, decreasing thus the amount of molecular oxygen which is believed to be responsible for the total oxidation of propane."

Promoters can address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by blocking the basic oxidating sites of the catalytic surface. This is done through the promotion of the catalyst with other oxides such as Nb205, MoOa, or Bi20a, which react with the rare earth oxide not involved in the structure. An alternative strategy involves adding CO2 into the feed, which shifts the absorption-desorption equilibrium of CO2 on the surface, likely on the basic oxidation sites, reducing the amount of molecular oxygen responsible for the total oxidation of propane. Compared to O2 co-feeding, promoters offer specific advantages in enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

促进剂可以通过阻塞催化表面的基本氧化位点来解决CO2氧化潜力较弱和惰性的局限性。这可以通过使用其他氧化物（如Nb205、MoOa或Bi20a）对催化剂进行促进来实现，这些氧化物与结构中不涉及的稀土氧化物反应。另一种策略是将CO2添加到流体中，这会改变CO2在表面上的吸附-脱附平衡，可能是在基本氧化位点上，从而减少被认为是导致丙烷完全氧化的分子氧的数量。与氧气共供给相比，促进剂在增强CO2活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能方面具有特定优势。
