Promoters play a crucial role in addressing the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. By enhancing CO2 activation, promoters improve the oxidizing ability of the catalysts, leading to more selective and stable catalytic performance. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, as they can more effectively activate CO2 and enhance the oxidation process.
