<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters, including Zn, Ni, and Cu, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by improving the oxidizing ability of these catalysts. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.
