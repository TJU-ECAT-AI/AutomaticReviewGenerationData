          To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters are utilized. These additives enhance CO2 activation, improve the oxidizing ability, and contribute to selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, promoters offer specific advantages. They allow for more efficient utilization of CO2, reduce energy consumption, and maintain catalyst stability under various reaction conditions.
