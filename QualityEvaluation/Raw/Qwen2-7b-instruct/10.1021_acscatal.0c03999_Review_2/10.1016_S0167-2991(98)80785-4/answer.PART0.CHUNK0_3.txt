Promoters, specifically carbon dioxide (CO2), address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing its activation and improving the oxidizing ability of the system. In the context of the provided literature, the use of a silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst (Cr2O3/SiO2) allows CO2 to act as a promoter. This strategy offers several advantages over alternative approaches like oxygen (O2) co-feeding. Firstly, CO2, when used as a promoter, selectively enhances the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to propylene (C3H6), leading to a higher yield of propylene compared to systems without CO2. Secondly, it suppresses the deactivation of the catalyst during the reaction process. Moreover, the promotion of CO2 occurs at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles, contributing to a more active catalyst surface. Lastly, the presence of CO2 helps maintain the surface of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst partially oxidized, thus preserving its activity and stability during the reaction.

在铬基催化体系中，促进剂，尤其是二氧化碳（CO2），通过增强其激活过程和改善系统的氧化能力来克服CO2弱氧化潜力和惰性的问题。根据提供的文献，在使用硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂（Cr2O3/SiO2）的背景下，CO2可以作为促进剂发挥作用。与氧气（O2）共供氧的替代策略相比，这种策略提供了几个优势。首先，当使用CO2作为促进剂时，它能选择性地增强丙烷（C3H8）的脱氢反应，产生丙烯（C3H6），从而获得丙烯的更高产率。其次，它还能抑制催化剂在反应过程中的失活。此外，CO2的促进作用发生在Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的界面上，这有助于催化剂表面的活性。最后，CO2的存在有助于保持Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的表面部分氧化，从而保持其活动性和稳定性。
