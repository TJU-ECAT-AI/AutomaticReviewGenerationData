Promoters such as carbon dioxide address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the activation of CO2 and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, they promote the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. By maintaining the surface of Cr203 partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2, they ensure selective and stable catalytic performance, leading to improved efficiency and selectivity in the conversion of C3H8.

促进剂如二氧化碳通过增强CO2的活化和提高催化剂的氧化能力，解决了CO2弱氧化潜力和惰性的限制。与氧气共喂养等替代策略相比，它们在选择性和稳定催化性能方面提供了特定优势。具体来说，它们促进了C3H8的脱氢生成C3H6，提高了C3H6的产率并抑制了催化剂失活。通过在CO2存在的反应过程中保持Cr203表面部分氧化，确保了选择性和稳定的催化性能，从而提高了C3H8转化的效率和选择性。
