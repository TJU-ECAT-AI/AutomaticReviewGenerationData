Promoters such as carbon dioxide (CO2) address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing its activation and improving the catalytic performance. Specifically, CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) over silica-supported chromium oxide (Cr203) catalysts, leading to increased yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppression of catalyst deactivation. The promotion occurs through the formation of a partially oxidized surface of Cr203 on the silica support, which maintains an active state during the reaction in the presence of CO2. This approach offers advantages over alternative strategies like oxygen (O2) co-feeding by selectively enhancing CO2 activation and achieving stable, selective catalytic performance.

促进剂如二氧化碳（CO2）通过增强其活化和改善催化性能，解决了CO2在铬基催化剂系统中的弱氧化电势和惰性问题。具体来说，CO2仅对硅酸盐支持的Cr203催化剂产生促进作用，促进丙烷（C3H8）的脱氢反应，从而增加丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活。这种促进作用通过在硅酸盐支撑物上形成部分氧化的Cr203表面实现，在CO2存在的条件下维持活性状态。与氧气（O2）共供给等替代策略相比，这种方法具有选择性增强CO2活化并实现稳定、选择性催化性能的优点。
