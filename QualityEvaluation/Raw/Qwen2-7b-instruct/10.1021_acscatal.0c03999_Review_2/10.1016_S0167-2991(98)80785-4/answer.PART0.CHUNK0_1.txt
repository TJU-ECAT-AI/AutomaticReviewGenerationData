1. "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
2. "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
3. "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

Promoters, such as CO2, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over a silica-supported chromium catalyst, enhancing the yield of propylene and suppressing catalyst deactivation. This is attributed to the catalyst's partially oxidized state maintained by CO2 during the reaction, which increases its activity for the dehydrogenation process. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, CO2 offers specific advantages by selectively activating CO2 and maintaining a stable, partially oxidized catalyst surface, thus enhancing the overall catalytic performance.

促进剂，如二氧化碳，通过增强二氧化碳激活、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能来解决二氧化碳弱氧化电势和惰性在铬基催化体系中的局限性。具体而言，二氧化碳在二氧化硅支持的铬催化剂上促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，提高了丙烯的产率并抑制了催化剂失活。这是由于反应过程中催化剂表面保持部分氧化状态，这增加了其脱氢过程的活性。与氧气共供给等替代策略相比，二氧化碳提供了特定优势，通过选择性激活二氧化碳并保持稳定的部分氧化催化剂表面，从而提高整体催化性能。
