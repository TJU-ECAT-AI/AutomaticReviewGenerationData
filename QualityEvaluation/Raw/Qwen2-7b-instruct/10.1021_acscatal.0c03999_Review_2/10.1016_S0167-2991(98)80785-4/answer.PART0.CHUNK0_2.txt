[1] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[2] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[3] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

Promoters, such as CO2, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst. Specifically, they enable selective and stable catalytic performance through mechanisms like maintaining a partially oxidized state of the catalyst surface. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters like CO2 offer advantages by directly promoting the desired chemical reactions without the need for additional oxygen supply, leading to enhanced efficiency and selectivity in the conversion processes.

促进剂，如二氧化碳，通过增强二氧化碳的激活和提高催化剂的氧化能力来解决二氧化碳弱氧化电位和惰性在铬基催化系统中的局限性。具体而言，它们通过保持催化剂表面部分氧化状态的机制实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。与替代策略如氧气共供相比，像二氧化碳这样的促进剂提供了优势，因为它可以直接促进所需的化学反应，而不需要额外的氧气供应，从而提高了转化过程的效率和选择性。
