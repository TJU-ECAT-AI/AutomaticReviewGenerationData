Promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems address CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by enhancing the activation of CO2, improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, and facilitating the formation of active species that promote the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction. Compared to alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding, promoters offer specific advantages in terms of increasing the stability of the catalyst, prolonging its useful life, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.
