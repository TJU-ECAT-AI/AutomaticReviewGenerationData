Promoters are used to tackle the weak oxidation potential and inertness of carbon dioxide in chromium-based catalytic systems. They enhance CO2 activation, improve the catalyst's oxidizing capability, and ensure selective and stable performance. Compared to methods like oxygen co-feeding, promoters are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.
