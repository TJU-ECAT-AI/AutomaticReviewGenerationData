[1] "Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the activation of CO2 and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst."
[2] "Specific advantages of promoters over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding include better selectivity and stability of the catalytic performance."

Promoters tackle the challenges posed by CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by boosting the activation of CO2 and enhancing the catalyst's oxidizing capability. Compared to alternative methods such as oxygen co-feeding, promoters offer superior selectivity and stability in maintaining the catalytic performance.
