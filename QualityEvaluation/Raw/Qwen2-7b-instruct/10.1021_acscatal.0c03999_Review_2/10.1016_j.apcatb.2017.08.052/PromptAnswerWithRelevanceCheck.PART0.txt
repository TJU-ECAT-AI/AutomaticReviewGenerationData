<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters like tin, antimony, and phosphorus enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide by addressing CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. They achieve this through improved CO2 activation, which in turn boosts the catalyst's oxidizing ability, leading to higher selectivity and stability. Compared to strategies like oxygen co-feeding, these promoters offer a more efficient CO2 activation method by increasing the surface area and porosity of the catalyst.
