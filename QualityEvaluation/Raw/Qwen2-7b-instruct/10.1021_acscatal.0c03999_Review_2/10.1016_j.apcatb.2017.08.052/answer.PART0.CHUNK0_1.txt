[1] "Promoters such as tin (Sn), antimony (Sb), and phosphorus (P) can address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation."
[2] "These promoters improve the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, leading to enhanced selectivity and stability."
[3] "Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, promoters offer a more efficient way to activate CO2 due to their ability to increase the surface area and porosity of the catalyst."

Promoters like tin, antimony, and phosphorus enhance the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide by addressing CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. They achieve this through improved CO2 activation, which in turn boosts the catalyst's oxidizing ability, leading to higher selectivity and stability. Compared to strategies like oxygen co-feeding, these promoters offer a more efficient CO2 activation method by increasing the surface area and porosity of the catalyst.
