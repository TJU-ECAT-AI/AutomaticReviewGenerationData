Promoters, specifically chromium (Cr), address the limitations of carbon dioxide's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. This leads to the formation of active oxygen species, which results in selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies like oxygen (O2) co-feeding, Cr doping provides better performance in terms of CO2 activation and oxidation.
