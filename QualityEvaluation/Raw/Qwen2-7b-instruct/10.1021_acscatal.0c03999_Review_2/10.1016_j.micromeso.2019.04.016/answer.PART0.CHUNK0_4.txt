[1] "Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems."
[2] "They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters tackle the challenges posed by CO2's low reactivity and lack of reactivity in chromium-catalyzed processes. They provide distinct benefits compared to methods such as oxygen co-feeding, by effectively activating CO2, boosting its oxidizing capacity, and ensuring both selectivity and long-term stability in the catalytic activity.
