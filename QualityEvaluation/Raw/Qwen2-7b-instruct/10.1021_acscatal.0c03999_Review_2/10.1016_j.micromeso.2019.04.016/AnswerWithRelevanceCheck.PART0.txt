          [1] "Cr doped mesoporous silica spheres for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2: Effect of Cr adding time in sol-gel process"
          [2] "The incorporation of chromium (Cr) as a promoter into mesoporous silica spheres (MSS) significantly enhances their catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2."
          [3] "The effect of Cr adding time in the sol-gel process on the catalytic performance of the Cr-doped MSS was investigated."
          [4] "The results indicate that the optimal Cr adding time is crucial for achieving high catalytic performance."
          [5] "Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the activation of CO2 and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst."
          [6] "Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, the use of promoters offers several advantages including enhanced CO2 activation, improved oxidizing ability, and selective and stable catalytic performance."
