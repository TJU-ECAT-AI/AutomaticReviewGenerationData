3.1. Surface area
The addition of modifiers produces a certain reduction in the area,possibly not due to the low content of the modifier used, but to the additional aqueous impregnation method developed. The used catalysts, after 30 h of operation, show a decrease in the surface area.

3.2. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
From the diffractograms, it is hard to discriminate between NiAl2O4 and g-Al2O3 as the reflections of these phases overlap. Both phases are amorphous, as evidenced by the extended reflections observed.

3.3. Temperature-programmed reduction
For the Ni catalyst, a unique band between 590 and 900 8C with a maximum located at about 825 8C is observed.

3.4. Temperature-programmed hydrogenation
The reactivity of deposited carbon was also investigated by TPH.

3.5. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM)
The TEM images of the metal-free catalyst and of the potassium-containing sample (Ni and Ni-K, respectively), after 30 h on stream in the reforming reaction, are shown in Fig. 6.

3.6. Catalytic activity
Figs. 7 and 8 show the data on catalytic activity for all catalysts, expressed as methane and carbon dioxide conversion at 750 8C versus the time on stream.

The introduction of promoters, such as potassium, calcium, manganese, and tin, in the Ni-Al2O3 catalysts resulted in a reduction of the surface area and a decrease in the catalytic activity over time. Specifically, the addition of calcium, manganese, and tin led to a dramatic reduction in catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition during the study period. In contrast, the potassium-modified catalyst showed lower carbon deposition and maintained high stability in its catalytic activity for 30 hours. The promoter potassium hindered carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, increased reducibility, likely modified the metal-support interaction, and did not alter the size or structure of the nickel particles. This suggests that potassium is advantageous over alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

引入促进剂，如钾、钙、锰和锡，在Ni-Al2O3催化剂中的使用导致了表面积的减少和催化活性随时间的下降。具体来说，钙、锰和锡的添加导致了催化活性的显著降低和碳沉积量的增加。相反，钾改性催化剂显示了较低的碳沉积和在30小时内的高稳定性催化活性。钾促进了碳在催化剂表面的积累，提高了可还原性，可能修改了金属-支持相互作用，并且没有改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。这表明与氧气共供给等替代策略相比，钾在增强CO2活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能方面具有优势。
