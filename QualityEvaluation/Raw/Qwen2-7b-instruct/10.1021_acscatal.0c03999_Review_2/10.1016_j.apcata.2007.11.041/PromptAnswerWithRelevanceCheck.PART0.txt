[1] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."
[2] "However, an excess of Ca promotes carbon deposition, readily deactivating the catalyst."
[3] "The addition of Mn produced a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, with a small decrease in catalytic activity."
[4] "In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."
[5] "The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation."
[6] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."
[7] "Our data confirm that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface,increases the reducibility, probably modifying the metal-support interaction, and modifies neither the size nor the structure of the nickel particles."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of potassium as a promoter in a Ni-Al2O3 catalyst significantly reduces carbon deposition, maintains high stability of catalytic activity, and decreases methane conversion by slightly blocking active sites for methane cracking. This promotes carbon gasification and enhances the reducibility of the catalyst without altering the size or structure of nickel particles.

3.1. Surface area
The addition of modifiers produces a certain reduction in the area,possibly not due to the low content of the modifier used, but to the additional aqueous impregnation method developed. The used catalysts, after 30 h of operation, show a decrease in the surface area.

3.2. X-ray diffraction (XRD)
From the diffractograms, it is hard to discriminate between NiAl2O4 and g-Al2O3 as the reflections of these phases overlap. Both phases are amorphous, as evidenced by the extended reflections observed.

3.3. Temperature-programmed reduction
For the Ni catalyst, a unique band between 590 and 900 8C with a maximum located at about 825 8C is observed.

3.4. Temperature-programmed hydrogenation
The reactivity of deposited carbon was also investigated by TPH.

3.5. Transmission electronic microscopy (TEM)
The TEM images of the metal-free catalyst and of the potassium-containing sample (Ni and Ni-K, respectively), after 30 h on stream in the reforming reaction, are shown in Fig. 6.

3.6. Catalytic activity
Figs. 7 and 8 show the data on catalytic activity for all catalysts, expressed as methane and carbon dioxide conversion at 750 8C versus the time on stream.

The introduction of promoters, such as potassium, calcium, manganese, and tin, in the Ni-Al2O3 catalysts resulted in a reduction of the surface area and a decrease in the catalytic activity over time. Specifically, the addition of calcium, manganese, and tin led to a dramatic reduction in catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition during the study period. In contrast, the potassium-modified catalyst showed lower carbon deposition and maintained high stability in its catalytic activity for 30 hours. The promoter potassium hindered carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, increased reducibility, likely modified the metal-support interaction, and did not alter the size or structure of the nickel particles. This suggests that potassium is advantageous over alternative strategies like oxygen co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.

引入促进剂，如钾、钙、锰和锡，在Ni-Al2O3催化剂中的使用导致了表面积的减少和催化活性随时间的下降。具体来说，钙、锰和锡的添加导致了催化活性的显著降低和碳沉积量的增加。相反，钾改性催化剂显示了较低的碳沉积和在30小时内的高稳定性催化活性。钾促进了碳在催化剂表面的积累，提高了可还原性，可能修改了金属-支持相互作用，并且没有改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。这表明与氧气共供给等替代策略相比，钾在增强CO2活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能方面具有优势。

[2] "However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."
[3] "This situation leads to the need of developing Ni catalysts with improved activity and selectivity in order to prevent or reduce the formation of carbon, through research into the following aspects: (i) the nature of the support [17], (ii) the support and catalyst preparation method [3,811], and (iii) the addition of promoters [2,9,12,13]."

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) are introduced. These promoters improve CO2 activation, enhance the oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance in several ways:

1. **Improving Nickel's Activity and Stability**: By altering the properties of the support and catalyst preparation methods, the promoters help develop Ni catalysts with improved activity and selectivity, preventing or reducing carbon deposition on the active centers. This is achieved by improving Ni diffusion, strengthening Ni-Al2O3 interaction, and delaying Ni sintering.

2. **Balancing Carbon Formation**: Promoters like potassium specifically migrate to the surface of nickel, selectively occupying the most active sites for the reforming reaction. This migration blocks some of the active sites, thereby reducing methane conversion. However, it also prevents the nucleation of carbon, as a small fraction of active sites remains available for the reforming process.

3. **Optimizing Metal-Support Interaction**: Promoters like tin (Sn) are selectively located on the step edges of the nickel surface, which minimizes the interaction between the promoter and the support. This ensures that the catalytic activity is not significantly affected while still providing beneficial effects on the reaction mechanism.

4. **Reducing Carbon Deposition**: Manganese (Mn) is particularly effective in reducing carbon deposition, albeit with a small decrease in catalytic activity. Other additives like cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and zirconium (Zr) show slight improvements in activity, whereas calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) cause dramatic reductions in activity and significant increases in carbon deposition.

5. **Enhancing Carbon Gasification**: Potassium (K) is also a good catalyst for carbon gasification, contributing to the overall efficiency of the CO2 reforming process by converting carbon into CO2, which is beneficial for the production of liquid hydrocarbons.

In summary, the use of these promoters allows for the optimization of nickel-based catalysts, improving their performance in CO2 reforming reactions, especially in terms of stability, activity, and the control of carbon deposition, leading to more efficient and selective conversion of CO2 into synthesis gas.

为了解决二氧化碳的弱氧化潜力和在铬基催化剂系统中的惰性问题，通过引入钾（K）、钙（Ca）、锰（Mn）和锡（Sn）等促进剂，可以改善二氧化碳激活、增强氧化能力并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。主要通过以下方式：

1. **提高镍的活性与稳定性**：通过改变支撑材料和催化剂制备方法的性质，促进剂有助于开发具有更好活性和选择性的Ni催化剂，防止或减少活性中心上的碳沉积。这通过改善镍的扩散、增强Ni-Al2O3相互作用以及延迟Ni的烧结来实现。

2. **平衡碳形成**：如钾这类特定的促进剂能迁移到镍表面，选择性地占据反应过程中的最活跃位点。这种迁移可以阻止一些活性位点，从而降低甲烷转化率。然而，它也阻止了碳的形成，因为一小部分活性位点仍然可用于重整过程。

3. **优化金属-支撑相互作用**：例如，锡（Sn）特别有效地定位在镍表面的台阶边缘上，这样就可以最小化促进剂与支撑材料之间的相互作用。这确保了催化活性不受显著影响，同时仍能对反应机制产生有益影响。

4. **减少碳沉积**：锰（Mn）特别有效于减少碳沉积，尽管可能伴有轻微的活性下降。其他添加剂如钴（Co）、铜（Cu）和锆（Zr）表现出轻微的活性提升，而钙（Ca）、锰（Mn）和锡（Sn）则导致活性显著下降和碳沉积增加。

5. **增强碳气化**：钾（K）也是碳气化的良好催化剂，通过将碳转化为CO2，对CO2重整过程的整体效率有好处，有利于液态烃的生产。

综上所述，这些促进剂的应用允许优化基于镍的催化剂，提高了二氧化碳重整反应中的性能，特别是在稳定、活性和控制碳沉积方面，从而实现了更高效的和选择性的二氧化碳转化为合成气体。

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters offer several advantages over alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding. Promoters enhance CO2 activation, improve the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, and contribute to selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, the use of potassium (K) as a promoter in nickel-based catalysts for CO2 reforming demonstrates that it can hinder carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, increase the reducibility, modify the metal-support interaction, and alter the structure of nickel particles without changing their size. This results in a decrease in methane conversion but maintains high stability and low carbon deposition, making it an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic performance of nickel-based catalysts in CO2 reforming processes.
