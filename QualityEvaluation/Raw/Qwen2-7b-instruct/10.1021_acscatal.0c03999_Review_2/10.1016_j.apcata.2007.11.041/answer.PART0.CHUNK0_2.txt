[1] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."
[2] "However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."
[3] "This situation leads to the need of developing Ni catalysts with improved activity and selectivity in order to prevent or reduce the formation of carbon, through research into the following aspects: (i) the nature of the support [17], (ii) the support and catalyst preparation method [3,811], and (iii) the addition of promoters [2,9,12,13]."

[13] "Potassium and other additives are selectively located on the step edges of the nickel surface. To prevent the nucleation of carbon, a small fraction of active sites have to be blocked on the stepped nickel surface."

[15] "In the case of the Ni-Ca, Ni-Mn and Ni-Sn-modified catalysts, the situation seems different since after 30 h on stream they show a significant reduction in activity and also important accumulation of deactivating carbon."

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters such as potassium (K), calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) are introduced. These promoters improve CO2 activation, enhance the oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance in several ways:

1. **Improving Nickel's Activity and Stability**: By altering the properties of the support and catalyst preparation methods, the promoters help develop Ni catalysts with improved activity and selectivity, preventing or reducing carbon deposition on the active centers. This is achieved by improving Ni diffusion, strengthening Ni-Al2O3 interaction, and delaying Ni sintering.

2. **Balancing Carbon Formation**: Promoters like potassium specifically migrate to the surface of nickel, selectively occupying the most active sites for the reforming reaction. This migration blocks some of the active sites, thereby reducing methane conversion. However, it also prevents the nucleation of carbon, as a small fraction of active sites remains available for the reforming process.

3. **Optimizing Metal-Support Interaction**: Promoters like tin (Sn) are selectively located on the step edges of the nickel surface, which minimizes the interaction between the promoter and the support. This ensures that the catalytic activity is not significantly affected while still providing beneficial effects on the reaction mechanism.

4. **Reducing Carbon Deposition**: Manganese (Mn) is particularly effective in reducing carbon deposition, albeit with a small decrease in catalytic activity. Other additives like cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and zirconium (Zr) show slight improvements in activity, whereas calcium (Ca), manganese (Mn), and tin (Sn) cause dramatic reductions in activity and significant increases in carbon deposition.

5. **Enhancing Carbon Gasification**: Potassium (K) is also a good catalyst for carbon gasification, contributing to the overall efficiency of the CO2 reforming process by converting carbon into CO2, which is beneficial for the production of liquid hydrocarbons.

In summary, the use of these promoters allows for the optimization of nickel-based catalysts, improving their performance in CO2 reforming reactions, especially in terms of stability, activity, and the control of carbon deposition, leading to more efficient and selective conversion of CO2 into synthesis gas.

为了解决二氧化碳的弱氧化潜力和在铬基催化剂系统中的惰性问题，通过引入钾（K）、钙（Ca）、锰（Mn）和锡（Sn）等促进剂，可以改善二氧化碳激活、增强氧化能力并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。主要通过以下方式：

1. **提高镍的活性与稳定性**：通过改变支撑材料和催化剂制备方法的性质，促进剂有助于开发具有更好活性和选择性的Ni催化剂，防止或减少活性中心上的碳沉积。这通过改善镍的扩散、增强Ni-Al2O3相互作用以及延迟Ni的烧结来实现。

2. **平衡碳形成**：如钾这类特定的促进剂能迁移到镍表面，选择性地占据反应过程中的最活跃位点。这种迁移可以阻止一些活性位点，从而降低甲烷转化率。然而，它也阻止了碳的形成，因为一小部分活性位点仍然可用于重整过程。

3. **优化金属-支撑相互作用**：例如，锡（Sn）特别有效地定位在镍表面的台阶边缘上，这样就可以最小化促进剂与支撑材料之间的相互作用。这确保了催化活性不受显著影响，同时仍能对反应机制产生有益影响。

4. **减少碳沉积**：锰（Mn）特别有效于减少碳沉积，尽管可能伴有轻微的活性下降。其他添加剂如钴（Co）、铜（Cu）和锆（Zr）表现出轻微的活性提升，而钙（Ca）、锰（Mn）和锡（Sn）则导致活性显著下降和碳沉积增加。

5. **增强碳气化**：钾（K）也是碳气化的良好催化剂，通过将碳转化为CO2，对CO2重整过程的整体效率有好处，有利于液态烃的生产。

综上所述，这些促进剂的应用允许优化基于镍的催化剂，提高了二氧化碳重整反应中的性能，特别是在稳定、活性和控制碳沉积方面，从而实现了更高效的和选择性的二氧化碳转化为合成气体。
