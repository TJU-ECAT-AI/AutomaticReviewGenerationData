[1] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction."
[2] "However, an excess of Ca promotes carbon deposition, readily deactivating the catalyst."
[3] "The addition of Mn produced a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, with a small decrease in catalytic activity."
[4] "In the case of Ca, Mn and Sn, a dramatic reduction of catalytic activity and a significant increase in carbon deposition were observed during the period of time under study."
[5] "The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation."
[6] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."
[7] "Our data confirm that the incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface,increases the reducibility, probably modifying the metal-support interaction, and modifies neither the size nor the structure of the nickel particles."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The introduction of potassium as a promoter in a Ni-Al2O3 catalyst significantly reduces carbon deposition, maintains high stability of catalytic activity, and decreases methane conversion by slightly blocking active sites for methane cracking. This promotes carbon gasification and enhances the reducibility of the catalyst without altering the size or structure of nickel particles.

在镍-Al2O3催化剂中引入钾作为促进剂，显著减少了碳沉积，保持了催化活性的高稳定性，并通过轻微阻塞甲烷裂解的活性位点降低了甲烷转化率。这促进了碳气化并增强了催化剂的可还原性，而不会改变镍颗粒的大小或结构。
