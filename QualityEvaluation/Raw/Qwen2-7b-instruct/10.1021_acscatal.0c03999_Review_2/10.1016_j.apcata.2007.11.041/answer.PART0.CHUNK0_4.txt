[1] "The CO2 reforming of methane (dry reforming) to produce synthesis gas, reaction (1), has gained renewed interest in recent years.
CH4  CO2 ! 2CO  2H2
(1)"

[2] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."

[3] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction. However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."

[4] "An interesting point is the nature of the promoter, and the amount used."

[5] "Hou et al. [3] studied the influence of Ca on the performance of Ni/a-Al2O3 catalysts in the dry reforming reaction, reporting that it depends upon the properties of the support and the amount of added Ca. Small amounts of Ca increase the catalyst activity and stability."

[6] "Compared to the unmodified catalyst,only Co, Cu and Zr showed a slight improvement in activity, while the rest of the additives reduced the activity in dry reforming."

[7] "The addition of Mn produced a noticeable reduction in carbon deposition, with a small decrease in catalytic activity."

[8] "The unmodified catalyst proved to be very active, selective and stable in the methane dry reforming reaction [17]."

[9] "The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation."

[10] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."

[11] "It has been proposed that potassium migrates from the support to the surface of nickel and neutralizes a fraction of the most active sites for the reforming reaction producing, as a consequence, a decrease in methane conversion."

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters offer several advantages over alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding. Promoters enhance CO2 activation, improve the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, and contribute to selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, the use of potassium (K) as a promoter in nickel-based catalysts for CO2 reforming demonstrates that it can hinder carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, increase the reducibility, modify the metal-support interaction, and alter the structure of nickel particles without changing their size. This results in a decrease in methane conversion but maintains high stability and low carbon deposition, making it an effective strategy for enhancing the catalytic performance of nickel-based catalysts in CO2 reforming processes.

为了应对二氧化碳氧化潜能较弱和惰性在铬基催化剂系统中的局限性，促进剂提供了一些优势，相比于氧气（O2）共供等替代策略。这些优势包括增强二氧化碳激活、提高催化剂的氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定催化性能。具体而言，在镍基催化剂中使用钾（K）作为促进剂进行二氧化碳重整显示，它可以阻碍催化剂表面的碳积累，增加可还原性，改变金属-支持相互作用，并且改变镍颗粒的结构而不改变其大小。这导致甲烷转化率的降低，但保持了高稳定性和低碳沉积，使其成为有效提升镍基催化剂在二氧化碳重整过程中催化性能的策略。
