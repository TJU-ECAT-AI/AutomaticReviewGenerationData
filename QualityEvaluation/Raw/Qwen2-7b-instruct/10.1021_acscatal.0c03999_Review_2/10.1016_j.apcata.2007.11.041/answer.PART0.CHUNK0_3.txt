[1] "The CO2 reforming of methane (dry reforming) to produce synthesis gas, reaction (1), has gained renewed interest in recent years.
CH4  CO2 ! 2CO  2H2
(1)"

[2] "This reaction plays a potentially important role in the industry as well as the steam reforming reaction, especially due to the generation of synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio that can be preferentially used for the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network."

[3] "Due to its availability and low cost, nickel is the most appropriate catalyst for the reaction. However, the Ni-based catalysts are readily deactivated by the deposition of carbon on the active centers."

[4] "Hou et al. [3] studied the influence of Ca on the performance of Ni/a-Al2O3 catalysts in the dry reforming reaction, reporting that it depends upon the properties of the support and the amount of added Ca. Small amounts of Ca increase the catalyst activity and stability."

[5] "Compared to the unmodified catalyst,only Co, Cu and Zr showed a slight improvement in activity, while the rest of the additives reduced the activity in dry reforming."

[6] "In this paper, the effect of the addition of the metals K, Sn, Mn, and Ca to a Ni-Al2O3 catalyst obtained via solgel is studied."

[7] "The unmodified catalyst proved to be very active, selective and stable in the methane dry reforming reaction."

[8] "The K-modified catalyst showed low carbon and high stability of its catalytic activity during 30 h of operation."

[9] "Compared with the unmodified catalyst, it showed a slight activity decrease of less than 4% in methane conversion and more than 17% reduction in carbon deposition."

[10] "The incorporation of potassium hinders the accumulation of carbon on the catalyst surface,increases the reducibility, probably modifying the metalsupport interaction, and modifies neither the size nor the structure of the nickel particles."

1. The CO2 reforming of methane, particularly for generating synthesis gas with a low H2/CO ratio, holds significance in the industry, particularly for the Fischer Tropsch synthesis network.
2. Nickel is commonly used as a catalyst for this reaction due to its availability and low cost, but it is prone to deactivation from carbon deposition on the active sites.
3. Small amounts of calcium can enhance the performance of nickel-based catalysts in CO2 reforming reactions, increasing their activity and stability.
4. Among various additives tested, only cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zr) showed a slight improvement in activity, whereas others reduced the activity in dry reforming processes.
5. The paper examines the impact of potassium (K), tin (Sn), manganese (Mn), and calcium (Ca) on a nickel-alumina catalyst produced through a sol-gel method.
6. The unmodified catalyst demonstrated exceptional activity, selectivity, and durability in methane CO2 reforming reactions.
7. The potassium-modified catalyst exhibited low carbon deposition and maintained a stable catalytic activity over 30 hours of operation.
8. Compared to the unmodified catalyst, the potassium-added catalyst experienced a minor decrease in methane conversion of around 4% and a significant reduction in carbon deposition exceeding 17%.
9. The addition of potassium impedes carbon accumulation on the catalyst surface, enhances reducibility, modifies the metal-support interaction, and maintains the size and structure of nickel particles.
