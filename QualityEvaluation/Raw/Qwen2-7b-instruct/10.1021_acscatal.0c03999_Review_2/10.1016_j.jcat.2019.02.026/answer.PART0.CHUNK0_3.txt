[1] "The presence of CO2 is beneficial for eliminating coke and inhibiting the formation of coke."
[2] "The coordination unsaturated oligomeric/isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[3] "CO2 can maintain Cr3+ species during DHP to inhabit coke formation on the Cr2+ species."
[4] "The highest TOF (C3H6) is obtained on 7CrAZrO2."
[5] "Methane and CO byproducts are mainly generated from the reaction of propylene and CO2 on the active oxidative chromium sites."

1. CO2 is advantageous in eliminating coke and preventing its formation.
2. The coordination unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites are key active sites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2.
3. CO2 keeps Cr3+ species intact during DHP to prevent coke formation on Cr2+ species.
4. The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst exhibits the highest efficiency in propane conversion.
5. Methane and CO byproducts originate from the reaction of propylene with CO2 on active oxidative chromium sites.

1. CO2有助于消除和抑制焦炭的生成。
2. 协调不饱和的寡聚化和孤立的Cr3+位点是丙烷与CO2进行脱氢反应的主要活性位点。
3. CO2在DHP过程中保持Cr3+物种状态，以防止Cr2+物种上的焦炭形成。
4. 7CrAZrO2催化剂在丙烷转化方面表现出最高效率。
5. 甲烷和CO副产品主要来源于丙烯与CO2在活性氧化铬位点上的反应。
