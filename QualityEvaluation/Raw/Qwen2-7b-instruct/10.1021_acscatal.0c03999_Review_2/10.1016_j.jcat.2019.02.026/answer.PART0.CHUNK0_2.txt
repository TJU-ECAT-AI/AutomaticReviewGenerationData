[1] "In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2."
[2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction."
[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 for inhibiting deactivation under real reaction conditions was preventing reduction of active sites and inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating coke."
[4] "CO2 can inhabit the reduction of active oxidative chromium species by excessive hydrogen species."
[5] "The elimination rate of coke under 5% CO2 was very low, which is similar to the real reaction conditions."

Promoters enhance CO2 activation and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance in chromium-based systems by shifting the reaction towards more olefin production, preventing the reduction of active sites, stabilizing the catalyst, and inhibiting the formation of coke. CO2 does this by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction and inhabiting the reduction of active sites by excessive hydrogen species. Under real reaction conditions, CO2 maintains the stability of the catalyst by preventing the fast formation and accumulation of coke. The elimination rate of coke under CO2 is low, which keeps the catalytic performance stable.

促进剂通过将反应方向转移到更多烯烃生产，防止活性位点的还原，稳定催化剂，并抑制结焦来增强二氧化碳的激活和实现铬基系统中的选择性和稳定催化性能。二氧化碳通过逆布杜瓦尔反应去除结焦并抑制活性位点的还原来实现这一目标。在真实反应条件下，二氧化碳通过防止快速形成和积累结焦来保持催化剂的稳定性。二氧化碳消除结焦的速率较低，这保持了催化性能的稳定性。
