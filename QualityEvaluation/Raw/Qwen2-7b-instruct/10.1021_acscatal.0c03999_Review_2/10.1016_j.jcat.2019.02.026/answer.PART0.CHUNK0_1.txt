[1] "The regenerative cycles of the xCrAZrO2 catalyst are represented in Fig. S3. The propylene yield on the catalyst decreased from 40% to 27% after 300 min on stream in the first cycle."
[2] "Moreover, the intensity of the bands at about 1395 and 1595 cm1 decrease first; then the bands at 871, 1007, and 1031 cm1 appear, and their intensities increase after 7 min at 550 C under 2% O2/Ar gas flows."
