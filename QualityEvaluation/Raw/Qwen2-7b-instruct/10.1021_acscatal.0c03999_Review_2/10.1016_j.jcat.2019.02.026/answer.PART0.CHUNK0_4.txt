[1] "The catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."
[2] "The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction."
[3] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction."
[4] "The foremost effect of CO2 for inhibiting deactivation under real reaction conditions was preventing reduction of active sites and inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating coke."
[5] "A new coke formation route was also proposed."

Promoters like CO2 address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability of the system, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. They offer advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding by preventing the reduction of active sites and inhibiting coke formation, leading to a new coke formation route. CO2 helps maintain the active sites in the oxidized state, which stabilizes the catalyst, and selectively reacts with active sites rather than eliminating coke, thus maintaining high reaction performance.

促进剂如CO2通过增强CO2的激活、改善系统的氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了CO2弱氧化电位和惰性在铬基催化体系中的局限性。与替代策略如O2共供相比，它们的优势在于防止活性位点的还原和抑制结焦形成，导致一个新的结焦形成途径。CO2有助于保持活性位点处于氧化状态，稳定催化剂，并选择性地与活性位点反应而不是消除结焦，从而维持高反应性能。
