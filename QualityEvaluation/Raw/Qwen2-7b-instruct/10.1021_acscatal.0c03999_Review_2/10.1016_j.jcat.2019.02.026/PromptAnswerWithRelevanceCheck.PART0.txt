[1] "Highly dispersed chromium oxide-modified mesoporous ZrO2 (xCrAZrO2) was prepared via an acid-base pair pathway and evaporation-induced self-assembly method for the dehydrogenation of propane reac- tion with CO2."
[2] "Catalytic performance results revealed that the 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abun- dant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."
[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke, since the rate of CO2 elimination of coke is pretty low."
[4] "We propose a new coke formation route, which is trace CO2 reacting with large H species on the Cr2+ species."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters, such as CO2, enhance the oxidation potential of chromium-based systems by acting as a weak oxidant. They facilitate CO2 activation, which is otherwise inert, by participating in redox reactions. CO2 specifically inhibits coke formation by reducing the availability of hydrogen species needed for coke growth, thus maintaining the active chromium species in their reduced state. This contrasts with the use of O2, which can more readily eliminate coke but may deactivate the catalyst by oxidizing active sites. CO2 thus offers a selective and stable approach to catalytic performance in CO2 activation.

促进剂，如二氧化碳，通过作为弱氧化剂来增强铬基系统的氧化潜力。它们通过参与红氧化反应促进了二氧化碳的活化，否则二氧化碳是惰性的。二氧化碳通过减少用于焦炭生长所需的氢物种的可用性来抑制焦炭形成，从而保持活性铬物种在还原状态，从而维持催化性能。与使用氧气相比，氧气可以更快速地消除焦炭，但可能会通过氧化活性位点来使催化剂失活。因此，二氧化碳提供了一种选择性和稳定的催化剂性能方法，在二氧化碳活化中。

[1] "In comparison with molecular O2, the lower oxidizing activity of CO2 is shown to shift the ODH reaction toward more olefin production, which means that more reactive olefins are prevented for deep oxidation in the presence of CO2."
[2] "CO2 can also oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction."
[3] "The foremost effect of CO2 for inhibiting deactivation under real reaction conditions was preventing reduction of active sites and inhibiting coke formation rather than eliminating coke."
[4] "CO2 can inhabit the reduction of active oxidative chromium species by excessive hydrogen species."
[5] "The elimination rate of coke under 5% CO2 was very low, which is similar to the real reaction conditions."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters enhance CO2 activation and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance in chromium-based systems by shifting the reaction towards more olefin production, preventing the reduction of active sites, stabilizing the catalyst, and inhibiting the formation of coke. CO2 does this by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction and inhabiting the reduction of active sites by excessive hydrogen species. Under real reaction conditions, CO2 maintains the stability of the catalyst by preventing the fast formation and accumulation of coke. The elimination rate of coke under CO2 is low, which keeps the catalytic performance stable.
