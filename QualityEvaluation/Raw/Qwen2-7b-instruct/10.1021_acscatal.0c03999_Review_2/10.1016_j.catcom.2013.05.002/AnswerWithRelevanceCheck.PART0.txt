          Promoters are used to address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies such as oxygen (O2) co-feeding. These advantages include enhancing the activation of CO2, improving its oxidizing ability, and achieving both selective and stable catalytic performance.
