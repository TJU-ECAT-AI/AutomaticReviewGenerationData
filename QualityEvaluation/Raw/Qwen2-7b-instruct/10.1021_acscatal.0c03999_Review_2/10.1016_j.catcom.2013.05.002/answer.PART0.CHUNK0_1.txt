[1] "Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems."
[2] "Specific advantages offered over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters in chromium-based catalysts, such as the hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 system, effectively tackle CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by enhancing its activation and improving the catalytic system's oxidizing ability. This results in selective and stable performance, surpassing strategies that involve oxygen co-feeding.
