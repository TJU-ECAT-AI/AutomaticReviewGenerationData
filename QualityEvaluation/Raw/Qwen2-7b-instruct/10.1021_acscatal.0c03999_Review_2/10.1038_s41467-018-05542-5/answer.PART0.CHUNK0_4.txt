[1] "CO2 was strongly adsorbed onto ruthenium surface, forming hybrid orbitals. The band gap energy was reduced significantly upon hybridization, enhancing CO2 dissociation."
[2] "When a reactant molecule is strongly adsorbed on a metal, the energy levels of electronic orbitals are rearranged. If the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is reduced,then the incident light can excite the electrons on the hybrid orbitals promoting the surface reaction."
[3] "The extent of the surface oxide was changed to observe the effect of the surface oxide for the light enhancement."
[4] "The enhancement by light was much smaller in the 2.6 nm Ru nanoparticles, while both the 5.6 and 17.1 nm Ru nanoparticles had a distinct enhancement."

1. CO2 was strongly adsorbed onto the ruthenium surface, forming hybrid orbitals. The band gap energy was reduced significantly upon hybridization, leading to enhanced CO2 dissociation.

2. The energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) was reduced when the reactant molecule was strongly adsorbed on the metal surface. This reduction allowed the incident light to excite electrons on the hybrid orbitals, promoting the surface reaction.

3. The surface oxide's extent was altered to assess its impact on the light enhancement.

4. The enhancement by light was notably lower in 2.6 nm Ru nanoparticles compared to 5.6 and 17.1 nm Ru nanoparticles.

1. CO2在钌表面强烈吸附，形成杂化轨道。杂化后，带隙能量显著降低，促进CO2解离。

2. 当反应物分子强烈吸附在金属表面上时，最高占据分子轨道（HOMO）与最低未占据分子轨道（LUMO）之间的能量间隙被减小。这使得入射光能够激发杂化轨道上的电子，促进表面反应。

3. 表面氧化层的量被改变以观察其对光增强的影响。

4. 在2.6 nm钌纳米颗粒中，光增强明显较低，而5.6和17.1 nm钌纳米颗粒显示出明显的增强。
