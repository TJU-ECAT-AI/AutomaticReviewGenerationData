[1] "Various metals (i.e., Ru, Rh, Pt, Ni, and Cu) were deposited on silica supports using a wet impregnation method."
[2] "At 150 C, the CO2 conversion was 1.6% without light, but it increased to 32.6% with light."
[3] "The light intensity during the CO2 hydrogenation was 35 mW cm2, which is too weak to induce any photothermal effect."
[4] "Interestingly, these spectra from in-situ UVVis measurements (black lines) agree well with the photoaction spectra, which are the plots of quantum yield (QY) vs. wavelength (red or blue dots in Fig. 2c, d)."

The use of light-assisted surface reactions in the context of CO2 hydrogenation offers several advantages over traditional methods. By employing both light and heat as energy sources, the overall energy usage can be minimized, and unique features not available in conventional thermal catalytic reactions can be realized. This approach enhances the catalytic activity of certain metals, like ruthenium (Ru), when exposed to light. Specifically, the CO2 conversion increases significantly upon light irradiation, reaching up to 32.6% at 150°C compared to only 1.6% without light. The quantum yield (QY) measurements confirm that the light-enhanced CO2 hydrogenation is driven by the generation of hot electrons, which originate from the light absorption by CO2 adsorbed on the metallic surface. The quantum yield spectra align well with the in-situ UVVis spectroscopy data, supporting the hypothesis that light-induced CO2 dissociation plays a crucial role in the enhanced catalytic performance.

在二氧化碳氢化过程中使用光辅助表面反应，提供了一系列传统方法所不具备的优势。通过同时利用光和热作为能量来源，可以极大地减少总能量消耗，并实现常规热催化反应中无法获得的独特特性。这种方法能够增强某些金属（如钌）在光照下的催化活性。具体而言，在光照下进行二氧化碳转换可显著增加，达到150°C时的32.6%，而没有光照时仅为1.6%。量子产率（QY）测量证实了光照增强的二氧化碳氢化主要由产生于金属表面吸附的二氧化碳的热电子驱动。量子产率谱与原位紫外可见光谱数据相吻合，支持了光照诱导的二氧化碳分解在增强催化性能中的关键作用。
