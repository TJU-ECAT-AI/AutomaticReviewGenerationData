[1] "Light irradiation reduces the reaction temperature significantly minimizing the total energy usage for CO2 hydrogenation."
[2] "When total energy consumption was compared at a CO2 conversion rate of 15%, the energy required for the case with light irradiation was only 37% of that for the case without light irradiation."
[3] "Furthermore, the CO2 conversion could be instantaneously turned on and off by light irradiation unlike a conventional thermal reaction."

The document illustrates that light-assisted CO2 hydrogenation offers significant energy savings and rapid response capabilities. By using light as an energy source, the reaction temperature is notably reduced, leading to minimized total energy usage. Specifically, the energy consumption for CO2 hydrogenation with light assistance was found to be 37% of the energy required when relying solely on thermal energy. Moreover, the CO2 conversion process becomes instantly controllable with light irradiation, unlike conventional thermal reactions which lack such quick adjustments. This highlights the potential for this method to contribute to more efficient energy use in chemical production.
