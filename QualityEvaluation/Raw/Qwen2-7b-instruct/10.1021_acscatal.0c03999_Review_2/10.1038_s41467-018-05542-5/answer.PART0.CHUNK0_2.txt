[1] "The DFT calculation is performed to investigate the changes in the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels for various metals."
[2] "When a reactant molecule is strongly adsorbed on a metal, the energy levels of electronic orbitals are rearranged. If the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is reduced, then the incident light can excite the electrons on the hybrid orbitals promoting the surface reaction."
[3] "The extent of the surface oxide was changed to observe the effect of the surface oxide for the light enhancement."
[4] "The enhancement by light was much smaller in the 2.6 nm Ru nanoparticles, while both the 5.6 and 17.1 nm Ru nanoparticles had a distinct enhancement."

The document elucidates how light can be utilized to enhance the activity of certain metal catalysts, particularly in the context of CO2 hydrogenation. By applying light, the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for a reactant molecule adsorbed on the metal surface is reduced. This reduction facilitates the excitation of electrons on the hybrid orbitals, promoting the surface reaction. The effect of surface oxide on light enhancement is also discussed, showing that metallic Ru is responsible for the enhancement. The size of the Ru nanoparticles plays a significant role in determining the effectiveness of light enhancement, with larger particles exhibiting greater enhancement.

文档阐述了如何利用光来增强某些金属催化剂的活性，特别是在CO2氢化反应中。通过应用光，金属表面吸附的反应物分子上最高占据分子轨道（HOMO）和最低未占据分子轨道（LUMO）之间的能量差被减少。这种减少使电子在杂化轨道上被激发，促进表面反应。表面氧化层对光增强效果的影响也被讨论，表明金属Ru对增强负责。Ru纳米粒子的尺寸在决定光增强效果方面起着重要作用，较大的颗粒表现出更大的增强效果。
