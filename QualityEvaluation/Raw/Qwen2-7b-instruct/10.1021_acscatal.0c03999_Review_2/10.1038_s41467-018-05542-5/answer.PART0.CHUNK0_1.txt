[1] "Light irradiation reduces the reaction temperature significantly minimizing the total energy usage for CO2 hydrogenation."
[2] "When a higher concentration of CO2 was used with CO2/N2/H2 flow rates of 5/30/15 sccm, the CO2 conversion was also significantly enhanced from 1.1 to 10.9% at 150 C upon light irradiation as shown in Supplementary Fig. 3."
[3] "The extent of the surface oxide was changed to observe the effect of the surface oxide for the light enhancement."
[4] "Supplementary Fig. 7 shows that the enhancement by light was much smaller in the 2.6 nm Ru nanoparticles, while both the 5.6 and 17.1 nm Ru nanoparticles had a distinct enhancement."
[5] "It was reported that larger Ru nanoparticles (e.g.,5 nm) exhibit a higher CO2 conversion than smaller ones for"

The document discusses how light irradiation enhances CO2 hydrogenation by reducing the reaction temperature, which minimizes the total energy usage. The use of a higher concentration of CO2 in the presence of light leads to a significant increase in CO2 conversion. The surface oxide's effect on light enhancement is also explored. Larger Ru nanoparticles exhibit a higher CO2 conversion compared to smaller ones under light-assisted conditions.
