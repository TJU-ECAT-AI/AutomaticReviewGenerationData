[1] "Various metals (i.e., Ru, Rh, Pt, Ni, and Cu) were deposited on silica supports using a wet impregnation method."
[2] "At 150 C, the CO2 conversion was 1.6% without light, but it increased to 32.6% with light."
[3] "The light intensity during the CO2 hydrogenation was 35 mW cm2, which is too weak to induce any photothermal effect."
[4] "Interestingly, these spectra from in-situ UVVis measurements (black lines) agree well with the photoaction spectra, which are the plots of quantum yield (QY) vs. wavelength (red or blue dots in Fig. 2c, d)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of light-assisted surface reactions in the context of CO2 hydrogenation offers several advantages over traditional methods. By employing both light and heat as energy sources, the overall energy usage can be minimized, and unique features not available in conventional thermal catalytic reactions can be realized. This approach enhances the catalytic activity of certain metals, like ruthenium (Ru), when exposed to light. Specifically, the CO2 conversion increases significantly upon light irradiation, reaching up to 32.6% at 150°C compared to only 1.6% without light. The quantum yield (QY) measurements confirm that the light-enhanced CO2 hydrogenation is driven by the generation of hot electrons, which originate from the light absorption by CO2 adsorbed on the metallic surface. The quantum yield spectra align well with the in-situ UVVis spectroscopy data, supporting the hypothesis that light-induced CO2 dissociation plays a crucial role in the enhanced catalytic performance.

[1] "The DFT calculation is performed to investigate the changes in the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels for various metals."
[2] "When a reactant molecule is strongly adsorbed on a metal, the energy levels of electronic orbitals are rearranged. If the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is reduced, then the incident light can excite the electrons on the hybrid orbitals promoting the surface reaction."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document elucidates how light can be utilized to enhance the activity of certain metal catalysts, particularly in the context of CO2 hydrogenation. By applying light, the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for a reactant molecule adsorbed on the metal surface is reduced. This reduction facilitates the excitation of electrons on the hybrid orbitals, promoting the surface reaction. The effect of surface oxide on light enhancement is also discussed, showing that metallic Ru is responsible for the enhancement. The size of the Ru nanoparticles plays a significant role in determining the effectiveness of light enhancement, with larger particles exhibiting greater enhancement.

The document illustrates that light-assisted CO2 hydrogenation offers significant energy savings and rapid response capabilities. By using light as an energy source, the reaction temperature is notably reduced, leading to minimized total energy usage. Specifically, the energy consumption for CO2 hydrogenation with light assistance was found to be 37% of the energy required when relying solely on thermal energy. Moreover, the CO2 conversion process becomes instantly controllable with light irradiation, unlike conventional thermal reactions which lack such quick adjustments. This highlights the potential for this method to contribute to more efficient energy use in chemical production.
