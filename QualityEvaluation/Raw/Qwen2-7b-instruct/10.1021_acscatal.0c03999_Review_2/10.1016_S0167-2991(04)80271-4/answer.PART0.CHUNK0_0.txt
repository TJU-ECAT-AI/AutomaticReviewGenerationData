[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 catalyst was also prepared by the template-ion exchange (TIE) method."
[3] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."
[4] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content (Table 1)."
[5] "UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, which could be assigned to O-Cr6+ charge transfer of chromates species,12 were mainly observed for both samples."
[6] "The selectivity to C3H6 was always higher than 90% and the conversion of C3H8 increased almost linearly with an increase in Cr content, strongly suggesting that Cr is the active site for the reaction."
[7] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2."
[8] "A peak observed between 350600 C (a) is probably due to the reduction of Cr6+,14 and disappeared in the second TPR (b)."

Promoters like Cr-MCM-41 and Cr-Cab-O-Sil address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by providing a suitable environment for CO2 activation and enhancing the oxidizing ability. They enable the selective and stable catalytic performance of CO2 dehydrogenation. Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, these promoters offer specific advantages because they:

1. Provide a high surface area and well-ordered mesoporous channels, facilitating the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products.
2. Ensure appropriate dispersion of chromium species on the support, optimizing the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.
3. Enable the formation of active chromium species, such as Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are crucial for the dehydrogenation process.
4. Allow for facile regeneration upon treatment with O2, recovering the original activity of the catalyst.
5. Maintain the structure and regularity of the mesoporous structure up to a certain chromium content, ensuring consistent catalytic behavior.
6. Show selective production of propene from CO2 during the dehydrogenation of propane, demonstrating their effectiveness in CO2 utilization.
