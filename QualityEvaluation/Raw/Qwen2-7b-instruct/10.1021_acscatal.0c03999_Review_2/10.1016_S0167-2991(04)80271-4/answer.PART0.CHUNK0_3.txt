The use of chromium-based catalysts, specifically Cr-MCM-41, addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by effectively utilizing CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane. The Cr-MCM-41 catalysts show superior activity in CO2 dehydrogenation compared to other metal catalysts like gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. By employing the direct hydrothermal synthesis method, the Cr-MCM-41 catalysts maintain high activity and selectivity towards propene production, even under varying chromium loadings. This is evidenced by the high yields of propene and the high selectivity exceeding 90%. The deactivation of the catalysts occurs during prolonged reactions, but they can be efficiently regenerated through treatment with oxygen, allowing for the reoxidation of reduced chromium species to their original tetrahedral coordination state. This cycle of reduction and oxidation plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process, highlighting the importance of the chromium species' coordination state in the catalytic performance of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.

在铬基催化剂，尤其是Cr-MCM-41的应用下，通过有效利用CO2的弱氧化潜力和惰性，解决了CO2在铬基催化系统中的局限性。Cr-MCM-41催化剂在CO2脱氢丙烷反应中表现出优于镓、镍、钒、铁、锰和钴等其他金属催化剂的活性。通过直接水热合成方法制备的Cr-MCM-41催化剂，在不同铬含量下保持高活性和丙烯选择性，甚至在各种条件下。这从高产率的丙烯和超过90%的选择性中得到证明。催化剂的失活发生在长时间反应期间，但可以通过氧气处理有效地再生，允许还原的铬物种重新氧化到它们原始的四面体配合状态。这个还原和氧化的循环在Cr-MCM-41催化剂的催化性能中起着关键作用，强调了铬物种配合状态的重要性。
