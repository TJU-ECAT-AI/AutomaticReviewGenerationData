[1] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."
[2] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems, such as CO2, address the limitations of its weak oxidation potential and inertness by participating in a reduction-oxidation cycle. This cycle allows CO2 to regenerate the active Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra. Specifically, CO2 reoxidizes the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra back to the active Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, enabling the selective and stable catalytic performance of CO2 in dehydrogenation reactions over Cr-MCM-41. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, CO2 offers a more effective means of activating CO2 and improving the oxidizing ability within the system, while maintaining selectivity and stability in the catalytic process.

在铬基催化剂系统中，如CO2这样的促进剂通过参与还原-氧化循环来解决其弱氧化电势和惰性的限制。这种循环允许CO2从还原的Cr3+Og八面体再生产活性Cr6+C>4四面体。具体而言，CO2将还原的Cr3+Og八面体重新氧化回活性的Cr6+O4四面体，从而使得CO2在Cr-MCM-41上进行脱氢反应时能够实现选择性和稳定性。与替代策略如氧气共喂料相比，CO2提供了一种更有效的激活CO2和提高氧化能力的方法，同时保持催化过程的选择性和稳定性。
