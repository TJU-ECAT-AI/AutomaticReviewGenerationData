Promoters such as Cr-MCM-41 enhance CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by providing a suitable surface for CO2 activation. They improve the system's oxidizing ability by facilitating the dehydrogenation of propane and the formation of CO from CO2. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters like Cr-MCM-41 offer specific advantages. They achieve selective and stable catalytic performance without the need for additional oxygen, potentially reducing costs and complexity. The regeneration of Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra by CO2 acts as a key mechanism in the reduction-oxidation cycle, supporting the catalytic activity.
