[1] "Not only O2 but also CO2 could regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra as suggested by the results of TPR and EXAFS."
[2] "It is concluded that during the reaction C?Hg is dehydrogenated to C3H6 by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra."
[3] "The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, and thus the reduction-oxidation cycle between Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra and Cr3+Og octahedra possesses an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H8 with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41."

Promoters in chromium-based catalytic systems address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by enhancing its activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, CO2 can regenerate the Cr6+C>4 tetrahedra from the reduced Cr3+Og octahedra. During the reaction, propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr3+Og octahedra. The reduced Cr3+Og octahedra is reoxidized to Cr6+O4 tetrahedra by CO2, thus forming a reduction-oxidation cycle that plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41.

促进剂在铬基催化系统中通过增强二氧化碳的激活、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化电位和惰性的限制。具体来说，二氧化碳可以从还原的Cr3+Og八面体再生Cr6+C>4四面体。在反应过程中，丙烷被Cr6+O4四面体脱氢为丙烯，同时Cr3+Og八面体被还原。还原的Cr3+Og八面体被二氧化碳重新氧化为Cr6+O4四面体，从而形成一个还原-氧化循环，在Cr-MCM-41上进行丙烷与二氧化碳的脱氢反应中发挥着关键作用。
