[1] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages."
[2] "First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 ! CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."
[3] "Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this reaction."
[4] "Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparalleled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, are expected to be new promising catalyst supports."

Promoters, like CO2, address the limitations of its weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by overcoming thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, improving propylene yield, avoiding deep oxidation, and enabling the recycling of greenhouse gases. Compared to strategies like O2 co-feeding, CO2 offers specific advantages in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.
