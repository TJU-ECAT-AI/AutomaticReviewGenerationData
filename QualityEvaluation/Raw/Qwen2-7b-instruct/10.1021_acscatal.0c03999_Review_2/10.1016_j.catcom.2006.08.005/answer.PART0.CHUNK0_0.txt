[1] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages."
[2] "First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 ! CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."
[3] "Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this reaction."

Promoters, like CO2, address the limitations of its weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by overcoming thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, improving propylene yield by removing hydrogen, avoiding deep oxidation that occurs with oxygen, and enabling the recycling of greenhouse gases. Compared to oxygen co-feeding, CO2 offers specific advantages in enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Mesoporous silica supports like MSU-x provide a high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels, making them promising catalyst supports. The use of these promoters in chromium-based systems demonstrates high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane, leading to better conversion rates than many other catalysts.
