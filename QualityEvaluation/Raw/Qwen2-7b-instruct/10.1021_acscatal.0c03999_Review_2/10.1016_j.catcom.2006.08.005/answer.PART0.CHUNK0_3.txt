[1] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen."
[2] "First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 ! CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."
[3] "Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this reaction."
[4] "The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages."
[5] "The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction."

Promoters, like CO2, address the limitations of its weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by overcoming thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, avoiding deep oxidation, and enabling the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2. Compared to alternative strategies such as oxygen co-feeding, CO2 offers enhanced CO2 activation, improved oxidizing ability, and achieves selective and stable catalytic performance. The use of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane results in higher propylene yields, selective propylene production, and efficient utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant.
