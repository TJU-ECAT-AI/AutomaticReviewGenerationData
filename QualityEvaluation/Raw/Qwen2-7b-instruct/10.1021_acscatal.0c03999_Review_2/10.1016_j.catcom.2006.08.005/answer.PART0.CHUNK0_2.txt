[1] "Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen."
[2] "First, thermodynamic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 ! CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxidant."
[3] "Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this reaction."
[4] "The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages."
[5] "The catalytic activities of Cr/MSU-x that varied with Cr2O3 loading are shown in Fig. 2."
[6] "Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly."
[7] "Although reaction conditions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher propane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table."

Promoters, like CO2, address the limitations of its weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by overcoming thermodynamic equilibrium limitations, avoiding deep oxidation that occurs with oxygen, and enabling the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2. Compared to strategies involving oxygen co-feeding, CO2 offers enhanced CO2 activation, improved oxidizing ability, and selective, stable catalytic performance. The use of CO2 as a promoter allows for the efficient dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, with the best performance achieved with a Cr2O3 loading between 5 wt% and 12 wt%, leading to high propane conversion and propylene yield.

促剂，如二氧化碳，通过克服热力学平衡限制、避免使用氧气导致的深度氧化以及实现温室气体二氧化碳的循环利用，解决了其弱氧化潜能和惰性的局限性。与氧气共给策略相比，二氧化碳提供了增强的二氧化碳激活能力、改善的氧化性能以及选择性和稳定的催化性能。使用二氧化碳作为促剂能够高效地将丙烷转化为丙烯，最佳性能在Cr2O3负载为5 wt%至12 wt%之间，这导致了高丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。
