Promoters, such as CO2, address the limitations of its weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by serving as a soft oxidant. This allows for the avoidance of deep oxidation that occurs when oxygen is used as an oxidant. Additionally, CO2 enables the recycling of greenhouse gases, making it an environmentally friendly alternative. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, CO2 offers enhanced CO2 activation and improved oxidizing ability, leading to selective and stable catalytic performance.

促进剂，如二氧化碳（CO2），通过充当温和的氧化剂来解决其氧化能力较弱和惰性的问题，在铬基催化剂系统中。这允许避免使用氧气作为氧化剂时发生的深度氧化。此外，CO2实现了温室气体的循环利用，使其成为环保的替代方案。与氧共供等其他策略相比，CO2能够提高CO2的活化程度和氧化能力，从而实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。
