<p>The Pd/PVPy system, prepared by the MVS technique, is an efficient and stable catalyst for the CC coupling reaction of iodo- and bromoarenes with alkyl acrylates. The corresponding trans cinnamates are obtained with yields in the range 3595% at 100 175 C depending on the substituent present on the aromatic ring of the aryl halide.</p>
<p>The catalyst is particularly stable and the leaching of palladium into the solution is very low. It works well also in air, thus simplifying the work-up of the catalytic process.</p>
<p>In addition, the catalyst can be recovered and reused without loss of catalytic activity. XPS structural studies indicate the presence of interactions between the basic nitrogen atoms of the pyridine moieties present in the polymer and the metal. Such interactions are present in the starting material as well as in the catalyst recovered after the catalytic reaction, thus accounting for the high stability of this catalytic system.</p>

This document discusses the palladium nanoparticles supported on polyvinylpyridine (Pd/PVPy) system, which acts as an efficient and stable catalyst for the coupling reaction of iodo- and bromoarenes with alkyl acrylates. The system produces trans cinnamates with yields ranging from 35% to 95% at temperatures between 100°C and 175°C, depending on the substituent on the aromatic ring of the aryl halide. The catalyst is notably stable, with minimal leaching of palladium into the solution. Its performance is unaffected by air, simplifying the post-reaction processing. The catalyst can be recovered and reused without losing its catalytic activity. XPS studies reveal interactions between the basic nitrogen atoms in the polyvinylpyridine and the metal, which contribute to the catalyst's stability. These interactions are present in both the initial material and the recovered catalyst after the reaction, explaining the system's high stability.
