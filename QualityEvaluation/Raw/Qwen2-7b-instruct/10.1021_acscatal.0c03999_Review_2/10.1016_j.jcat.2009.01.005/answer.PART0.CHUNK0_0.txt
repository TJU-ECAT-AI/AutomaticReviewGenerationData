[1] "The palladium-catalyzed coupling of olefins with aryl or vinyl halides, known as the Heck reaction [1], is one of the most im- portant reactions for the formation of CC bonds in organic syn- thesis, from both the research and industrial points of view [2,3]."
[2] "Unfortunately, in many cases, the supported systems leach palladium under the reaction conditions leading to highly active soluble palladium species."
[3] "The catalyst is particularly stable and the leach- ing of palladium into the solution is very low."
[4] "In addition, the catalyst can be recovered and reused without loss of catalytic activity."
[5] "XPS structural studies indicate the presence of interactions between the basic nitrogen atoms of the pyridine moi- eties present in the polymer and the metal."

1. The Heck reaction, known for its role in forming CC bonds in organic synthesis, is crucial for both research and industry. 
2. Many supported palladium systems release significant amounts of palladium under reaction conditions, creating active soluble species.  
3. The palladium on polyvinylpyridine (Pd/PVPy) catalyst exhibits exceptional stability, minimizing the leaching of palladium into the solution.
4. This catalyst can be efficiently recovered and reused without losing its catalytic activity.
5. XPS studies reveal interactions between the nitrogen atoms in the pyridine groups of the polymer and the metal, contributing to the catalyst's stability.
