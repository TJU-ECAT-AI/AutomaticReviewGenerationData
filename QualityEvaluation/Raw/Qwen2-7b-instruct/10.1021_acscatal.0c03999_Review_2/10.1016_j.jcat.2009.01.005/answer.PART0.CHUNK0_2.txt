The Pd/PVPy system is an efficient and stable catalyst for the CC coupling reaction of iodo- and bromoarenes with alkyl acrylates. It produces trans-cinnamates with yields ranging from 35% to 95% at temperatures between 100 and 175 degrees Celsius, depending on the substituent on the aromatic ring of the aryl halide. The catalyst is notably stable, with minimal leaching of palladium into the solution. It performs well even in air, simplifying the cleanup process. The catalyst can be recovered and reused without a loss in catalytic activity. XPS studies reveal that the basic nitrogen atoms of the pyridine moieties in the polymer interact with the metal.
