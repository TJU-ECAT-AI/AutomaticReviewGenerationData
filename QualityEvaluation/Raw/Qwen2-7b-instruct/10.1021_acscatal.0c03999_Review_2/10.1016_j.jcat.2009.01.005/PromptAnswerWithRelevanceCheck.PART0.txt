[1] "The palladium-catalyzed coupling of olefins with aryl or vinyl halides, known as the Heck reaction [1], is one of the most im- portant reactions for the formation of CC bonds in organic syn- thesis, from both the research and industrial points of view [2,3]."
[2] "Unfortunately, in many cases, the supported systems leach palladium under the reaction conditions leading to highly active soluble palladium species."
[3] "The catalyst is particularly stable and the leach- ing of palladium into the solution is very low."
[4] "In addition, the catalyst can be recovered and reused without loss of catalytic activity."
[5] "XPS structural studies indicate the presence of interactions between the basic nitrogen atoms of the pyridine moi- eties present in the polymer and the metal."

This document discusses the palladium nanoparticles supported on polyvinylpyridine (Pd/PVPy) system, which acts as an efficient and stable catalyst for the coupling reaction of iodo- and bromoarenes with alkyl acrylates. The system produces trans cinnamates with yields ranging from 35% to 95% at temperatures between 100°C and 175°C, depending on the substituent on the aromatic ring of the aryl halide. The catalyst is notably stable, with minimal leaching of palladium into the solution. Its performance is unaffected by air, simplifying the post-reaction processing. The catalyst can be recovered and reused without losing its catalytic activity. XPS studies reveal interactions between the basic nitrogen atoms in the polyvinylpyridine and the metal, which contribute to the catalyst's stability. These interactions are present in both the initial material and the recovered catalyst after the reaction, explaining the system's high stability.
