[1] "The Pd/PVPy system, prepared by the MVS technique, is an efficient and stable catalyst for the CC coupling reaction of iodo- and bromoarenes with alkyl acrylates. The corresponding trans cinnamates are obtained with yields in the range 3595% at 100 175 C depending on the substituent present on the aromatic ring of the aryl halide."
[2] "The catalyst is particularly stable and the leaching of palladium into the solution is very low."
[3] "It works well also in air, thus simplifying the work-up of the catalytic process."
[4] "In addition, the catalyst can be recovered and reused without loss of catalytic activity."
[5] "XPS structural studies indicate the presence of interactions between the basic nitrogen atoms of the pyridine moieties present in the polymer and the metal."
