<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters like Ni improve the oxidizing ability of CO2 in chromium-based catalytic systems by facilitating its dissociation into CO and activated O (O*ads). This activated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx, enhancing the stability of the catalyst and the selectivity for propylene in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, Ni promotes achieve enhanced CO2 activation, improved oxidizing ability, and selective and stable catalytic performance without significantly decreasing the selectivity for C3H6.

促进剂如Ni通过使CO2分解为CO和激活的O（O*ads）来提高铬基催化体系中CO2的氧化能力。生成的O*ads可以再生还原的CrOx，从而增强催化剂的稳定性并提高丙烯在丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢反应（ODHP）中的选择性。与氧2共喂养等替代策略相比，Ni的使用可以在不显著降低C3H6的选择性的情况下，实现增强的CO2活化、提高的氧化能力以及选择性和稳定的催化性能。
