[1] "CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[2] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions...and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[3] "Choe et al. studied the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 by using a molecular orbital method on Ni(111) within a 25-atom cluster. The strong chemisorption of CO2 on Ni leads to the bending of the molecule because the d orbital is mixed with 2πμ in the CO2 orbital to form 6a1. The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbon-oxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[4] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[5] "Interestingly, for the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."

1. Promoters like Ni enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 by activating it and enabling its dissociation to CO and activated O (O*ads), thus improving CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. This approach offers specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, as it maintains a stable selectivity for propylene and achieves enhanced catalytic stability without significantly decreasing the reaction selectivity for propylene.
2. The addition of Ni to chromium-based catalysts addresses CO2's limitations by facilitating its activation and dissociation into CO and O*ads. This process regenerates the active Cr3+ states, which are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP), leading to improved oxidizing ability and selective production of propylene compared to methods involving O2 co-feeding.

Promoters, specifically nickel (Ni), address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by inducing the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads). This enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing it to effectively reoxidize reduced chromium oxides (CrOx). Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene, Ni promotes a more selective and stable catalytic performance by maintaining the active Cr3+ state throughout the reaction. The three-step temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis confirms the enhanced oxidizing ability of CO2 and the regeneration of the active Cr3+ state in the presence of Ni, leading to a stable yield of propylene.

Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the oxidizing ability. They achieve this through the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads) on the Ni surface. This activated oxygen can then play a role in the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species, maintaining the active Cr3+ state during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters like Ni offer the advantage of maintaining a stable selectivity for propylene while reducing the deactivation rate of the catalyst. This is evidenced by the ability of Ni to regenerate active Cr3+ sites, thus enabling the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst to show high stability in the ODHP reaction.

1. Promoters, such as nickel (Ni), address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Specifically, Ni catalysts effectively activate CO2, enabling its dissociation into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which then regenerates the reduced active phase of the catalyst, such as chromium oxide (CrOx). This approach is advantageous over alternative strategies like oxygen (O2) co-feeding because it avoids the potential drawbacks of O2 co-feeding, such as decreased selectivity for propylene and enhanced deactivation rates due to coke formation.

2. Nickel (Ni) promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) by facilitating the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated oxygen (O*ads) on its surface. This generated O*ads plays a crucial role in reoxidizing the reduced active phase of the catalyst, such as CrOx, which is essential for the ODHP reaction. The use of Ni as a promoter ensures a stable and selective production of propylene, thereby overcoming the limitations associated with the weak oxidation potential and inertness of CO2 in chromium-based systems.
