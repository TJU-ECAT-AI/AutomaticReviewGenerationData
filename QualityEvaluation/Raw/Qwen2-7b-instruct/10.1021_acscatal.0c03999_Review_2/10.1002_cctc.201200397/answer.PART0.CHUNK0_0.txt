[1] "CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[2] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions...and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[3] "Choe et al. studied the adsorption and dissociation of CO2 by using a molecular orbital method on Ni(111) within a 25-atom cluster. The strong chemisorption of CO2 on Ni leads to the bending of the molecule because the d orbital is mixed with 2πμ in the CO2 orbital to form 6a1. The chemisorbed CO2 undergoes a sequential carbon-oxygen bond cleavage to generate CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[4] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[5] "Interestingly, for the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."

1. Promoters like Ni enhance the oxidizing ability of CO2 by activating it and enabling its dissociation to CO and activated O (O*ads), thus improving CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems. This approach offers specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, as it maintains a stable selectivity for propylene and achieves enhanced catalytic stability without significantly decreasing the reaction selectivity for propylene.
2. The addition of Ni to chromium-based catalysts addresses CO2's limitations by facilitating its activation and dissociation into CO and O*ads. This process regenerates the active Cr3+ states, which are crucial for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP), leading to improved oxidizing ability and selective production of propylene compared to methods involving O2 co-feeding.

1. 镍等促进剂通过激活二氧化碳并使其分解为一氧化碳和活性氧（O*吸附），提高了二氧化碳在铬基催化剂系统中的氧化能力，从而解决了二氧化碳的弱氧化能力和惰性问题。与采用氧气共供给等替代策略相比，这种方法在保持稳定丙烯选择性的同时，实现了增强的催化稳定性。
2. 将镍添加到铬基催化剂中，可以解决二氧化碳的限制，通过激活二氧化碳并使其分解为一氧化碳和活性氧（O*吸附），从而再生活性Cr3+状态，这对丙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢反应至关重要（ODHP），这使得在不显著降低丙烯产率的情况下，实现了增强的氧化能力以及选择性生产丙烯。
