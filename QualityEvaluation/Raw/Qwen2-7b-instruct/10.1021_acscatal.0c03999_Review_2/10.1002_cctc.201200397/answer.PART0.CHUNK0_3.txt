Promoters like Ni address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the oxidizing ability. They achieve this through the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads) on the Ni surface. This activated oxygen can then play a role in the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species, maintaining the active Cr3+ state during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters like Ni offer the advantage of maintaining a stable selectivity for propylene while reducing the deactivation rate of the catalyst. This is evidenced by the ability of Ni to regenerate active Cr3+ sites, thus enabling the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst to show high stability in the ODHP reaction.

促进剂如Ni通过增强CO2激活和提高氧化能力，解决了CO2在铬基催化体系中弱氧化性和惰性的限制。它们通过在Ni表面分解CO2为CO和活性氧（O*ads）来实现这一点。这些激活的氧可以参与还原CrOx物种的再氧化过程，保持ODHP反应中的活性Cr3+状态。与O2共给等替代策略相比，像Ni这样的促进剂的优势在于维持丙烯选择性的同时降低催化剂失活率。这体现在Ni能够再生活性Cr3+位点的能力上，从而使0.5Ni-Cr/Si催化剂在ODHP反应中表现出高稳定性。
