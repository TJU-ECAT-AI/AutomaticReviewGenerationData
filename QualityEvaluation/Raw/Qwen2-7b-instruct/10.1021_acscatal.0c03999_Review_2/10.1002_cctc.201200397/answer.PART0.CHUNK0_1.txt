[1] "CO2 has limited oxidizing ability, in terms of reoxidation of the reduced CrOx, owing to its thermodynamically stable properties."
[2] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[3] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[4] "Interestingly, for the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained during the catalytic reaction, which indicates that the active sites are still maintained."

Promoters, specifically nickel (Ni), address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by inducing the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads). This enhances the oxidizing ability of CO2, allowing it to effectively reoxidize reduced chromium oxides (CrOx). Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, which can significantly decrease selectivity for propylene, Ni promotes a more selective and stable catalytic performance by maintaining the active Cr3+ state throughout the reaction. The three-step temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis confirms the enhanced oxidizing ability of CO2 and the regeneration of the active Cr3+ state in the presence of Ni, leading to a stable yield of propylene.

促进剂，特别是镍（Ni），通过诱导二氧化碳分解为CO和激活氧（O*ads）来解决二氧化碳氧化能力较弱且惰性的问题。这增强了二氧化碳的氧化能力，使其能够有效地重新氧化还原的铬氧化物（CrOx）。与共供给氧气等替代策略相比，这些策略可能导致丙烯选择性显著降低，而Ni则通过在整个反应过程中保持活性的Cr3+状态，实现了更选择性和稳定的催化性能。三步温度程序化还原（TPR）分析证实了在Ni存在下二氧化碳的增强氧化能力和活性Cr3+状态的再生，从而导致丙烯的稳定产率。
