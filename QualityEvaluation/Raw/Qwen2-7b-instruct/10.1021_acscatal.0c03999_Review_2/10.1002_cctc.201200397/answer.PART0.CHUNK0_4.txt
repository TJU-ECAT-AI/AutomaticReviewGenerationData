[1] "Ni-based catalysts are widely used in CO2 reforming reactions2123 and the reverse watergas shift (RWGS) reaction.24 Such catalysts have an excellent ability to activate CO2, even under harsh reaction conditions."
[2] "CO2 can also be used as an oxygen transfer agent or as a soft oxidant.5 By using CO2 as a soft oxidant in the ODHP reaction, coke deposition can be eliminated and the reduced active phase can be reoxidized."
[3] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[4] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[5] "Exsitu XPS measurements, the non-promoted catalyst showed a rapid transformation of active sitesreduction of active Cr3+ to inactive Cr2+whereas Ni allowed the catalyst to be maintained in the Cr3+ state, which is enabled by the O*ads generated near Ni."

1. Promoters, such as nickel (Ni), address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving its oxidizing ability. Specifically, Ni catalysts effectively activate CO2, enabling its dissociation into CO and activated oxygen (O*ads), which then regenerates the reduced active phase of the catalyst, such as chromium oxide (CrOx). This approach is advantageous over alternative strategies like oxygen (O2) co-feeding because it avoids the potential drawbacks of O2 co-feeding, such as decreased selectivity for propylene and enhanced deactivation rates due to coke formation.

2. Nickel (Ni) promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) by facilitating the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated oxygen (O*ads) on its surface. This generated O*ads plays a crucial role in reoxidizing the reduced active phase of the catalyst, such as CrOx, which is essential for the ODHP reaction. The use of Ni as a promoter ensures a stable and selective production of propylene, thereby overcoming the limitations associated with the weak oxidation potential and inertness of CO2 in chromium-based systems.

1. 镍（Ni）等促进剂通过增强二氧化碳激活和提高其氧化能力，解决了二氧化碳在铬基催化系统中弱氧化潜力和惰性的问题。具体来说，Ni催化剂有效地激活二氧化碳，使其分解为一氧化碳和活性氧（O*吸附），然后再生催化剂中的还原活性相，如铬氧化物（CrOx）。与氧气（O2）共喂养等替代策略相比，这种方法的优势在于避免了O2共喂养可能带来的问题，如丙烯选择性降低和由于焦炭形成导致的催化剂失活率增加。

2. 镍（Ni）通过在其表面促进二氧化碳分解为一氧化碳和活性氧（O*吸附），促进了丙烷与二氧化碳（ODHP）的氧化脱氢反应。生成的O*吸附在再生催化剂中的还原活性相，如CrOx，对于ODHP反应至关重要。使用Ni作为促进剂确保了丙烯的稳定和选择性生产，从而克服了二氧化碳在铬基系统中弱氧化潜力和惰性的问题。
