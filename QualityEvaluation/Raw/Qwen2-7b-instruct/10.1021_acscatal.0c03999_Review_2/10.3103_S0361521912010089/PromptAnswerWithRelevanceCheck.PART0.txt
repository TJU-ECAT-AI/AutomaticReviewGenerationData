Promoters such as alkali metals (Li, Na, K) are introduced into chromium oxide catalysts to enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, they address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by increasing the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. They improve the activation of CO2 and the oxidizing ability, leading to selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters offer advantages in terms of maintaining high activity and selectivity over longer periods of operation, as demonstrated by their ability to maintain a high yield of propene (up to 100% selectivity) at high conversion rates (22% conversion of propane) on the catalyst. Potassium, in particular, has been found to significantly improve the stability of chromium oxide catalysts containing 3.0% Cr, allowing for prolonged operation without significant loss of catalytic activity.

Promoters, such as potassium, enhance CO2 activation and improve the oxidizing ability of chromium-based catalytic systems. They specifically address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by facilitating CO2's incorporation into the reaction mechanism. Potassium, in particular, is shown to increase the selectivity and stability of catalysts, leading to enhanced performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. By replacing protons in hydroxyl groups, potassium reduces the formation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyls, thereby decreasing the activity and stability of the catalysts in the presence of CO2. This reduction in surface hydroxyls concentration is associated with a decrease in catalytic activity and stability during the dehydrogenation process.

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters such as alkali metals like lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) are introduced. These promoters enhance CO2 activation, improve the oxidizing ability of the system, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, they:

1. Reduce coke formation, decreasing the amount of coke produced during the dehydrogenation process.
2. Shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction towards the formation of olefins, improving selectivity.
3. Increase the stability of catalysts, particularly chromium oxide catalysts, by altering their activity through the replacement of protons with alkali metal ions.
4. Facilitate the use of CO2 as an effective oxidizing agent in the presence of paraffins, making oxidative dehydrogenation more industrially feasible.
5. Allow for the use of supported chromium catalysts, which remain active during the dehydrogenation of lower paraffins in the presence of CO2.
6. Offer carriers with low acidity that resist polymerization and coke deposition, maintaining catalyst integrity.
7. Increase the effectiveness of catalysts through the introduction of promoters, which can positively impact the dehydrogenation of paraffins.
8. Show that alkali metals like Li, Na, and K can have varying effects on catalyst activity, stability, and selectivity, depending on their concentration.
9. Demonstrate that the introduction of Li2O, Na2O, and K2O can suppress the catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 in certain conditions.
10. Highlight that the stability and operational duration of catalysts can vary significantly based on the type and concentration of promoters used.
11. Indicate that at specific potassium concentrations, the catalyst can maintain high selectivity and stability in the formation of propene from propane.
12. Emphasize that the addition of sodium can result in the lowest initial activity among the tested promoters.
13. Show that potassium can maintain or increase stability compared to unpromoted catalysts, particularly when used in equimolar quantities with Li and Na.
