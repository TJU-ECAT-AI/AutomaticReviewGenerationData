[1] "The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts."
[2] "The introduction of potassium into the chromium oxide catalysts can be effective for increasing their stability and selectivity."
[3] "Potassium (0.15%) improved the stability of the chromium oxide catalyst containing 3.0% Cr."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters, particularly potassium, enhance the stability and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation processes. They improve the catalysts' ability to activate CO2, increase oxidizing power, and achieve selective and stable performance. Compared to strategies like O2 co-feeding, potassium introduces a more efficient way to manage CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, leading to enhanced catalytic efficiency.
