Promoters such as alkali metals (Li, Na, K) are introduced into chromium oxide catalysts to enhance their effectiveness. Specifically, they address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by increasing the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. They improve the activation of CO2 and the oxidizing ability, leading to selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters offer advantages in terms of maintaining high activity and selectivity over longer periods of operation, as demonstrated by their ability to maintain a high yield of propene (up to 100% selectivity) at high conversion rates (22% conversion of propane) on the catalyst. Potassium, in particular, has been found to significantly improve the stability of chromium oxide catalysts containing 3.0% Cr, allowing for prolonged operation without significant loss of catalytic activity.

促进剂如碱金属（Li，Na，K）被引入到铬氧化物催化剂中以提高其有效性。它们通过增加催化剂的稳定性和选择性来解决CO2弱氧化潜力和惰性的限制。它们提高了CO2的激活能力和氧化能力，从而实现了选择性和稳定的催化性能。与O2共供给等策略相比，促进剂在维持高活性和选择性方面具有优势，这体现在它们能够保持高达100％的丙烯产率（丙烷转化率为22％）在催化剂上进行长时间操作。特别是钾，在铬氧化物催化剂中添加等量的钾，可以显著提高含3.0％Cr的催化剂的稳定性，允许长时间运行而不会显著损失催化活性。
