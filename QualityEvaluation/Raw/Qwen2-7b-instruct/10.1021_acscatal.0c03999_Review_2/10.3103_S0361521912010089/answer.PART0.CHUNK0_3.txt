Promoters, such as potassium, enhance CO2 activation and improve the oxidizing ability of chromium-based catalytic systems. They specifically address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by facilitating CO2's incorporation into the reaction mechanism. Potassium, in particular, is shown to increase the selectivity and stability of catalysts, leading to enhanced performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. By replacing protons in hydroxyl groups, potassium reduces the formation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyls, thereby decreasing the activity and stability of the catalysts in the presence of CO2. This reduction in surface hydroxyls concentration is associated with a decrease in catalytic activity and stability during the dehydrogenation process.

促进剂，如钾，增强了二氧化碳的活化和铬基催化系统的氧化能力。它们通过促进二氧化碳融入反应机制，解决了二氧化碳弱氧化潜能和惰性的局限性。钾特别被证明可以提高催化剂的选择性和稳定性，从而在丙烷氧化脱氢过程中实现性能增强。通过替换羟基中的质子，钾减少了羟基之间的氢键形成的可能性，从而降低了催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下的活性和稳定性。表面羟基浓度的降低与催化活性和稳定性在脱氢过程中的下降相关联。
