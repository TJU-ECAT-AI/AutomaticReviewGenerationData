1. Promoters enhance the CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by increasing the stability and selectivity of the catalysts. They offer advantages over O2 co-feeding in terms of better CO2 activation, increased oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance.
2. The introduction of alkaline promoters into chromium oxide catalysts significantly improves their effectiveness in dehydrogenation reactions.
3. The study found that the introduction of Li2O, Na2O, and K2O reduces the catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane.
4. The stability of the catalysts was not extensively studied by Ge et al., with the operational time being restricted to 3 hours.
5. IR spectroscopy was employed to investigate how the hydroxyl cover of chromium oxide catalysts affects their performance in the presence of alkali metals.
6. The research indicates that the hydroxyl cover of chromium oxide catalysts plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of lower paraffins.
7. The introduction of potassium into the catalysts resulted in a high yield of propene for 60 hours, with a higher selectivity compared to the chromium oxide catalyst without potassium.
8. Potassium (0.15%) enhanced the stability of the chromium oxide catalyst with 3.0% Cr, indicating its effectiveness in improving catalyst performance.
