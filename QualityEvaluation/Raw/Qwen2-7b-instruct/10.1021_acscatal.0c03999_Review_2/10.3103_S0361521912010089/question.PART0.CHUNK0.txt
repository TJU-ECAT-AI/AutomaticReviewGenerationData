Original Russian Text  A.L. Lapidus, Yu.A. Agafonov, N.A. Gaidai, D.V. Trushin, N.V. Nekrasov, 2012, published in Khimiya Tverdogo Topliva, 2012, No. 1, pp. 1725. 14 The processing of mine gas for the purpose of obtaining valuable products for chemical industry is a problem of considerable current interest. The efficient use of lower paraffin hydrocarbons, which are con tained in this gas, is promising. Upon the dehydroge nation of lower paraffins, corresponding olefins are obtained, the need for which constantly increases. The direct dehydrogenation of paraffins is performed on either chromium oxide or platinum catalysts. The dehydrogenation reaction on chromium oxide cata lysts is accompanied by significant coke formation;therefore, several reactors are used in the process:some of them operate in the process of dehydrogena tion, and the others are subjected to regeneration. The introduction of oxidizing agents (O2, CO2) makes it possible to decrease the resulting coke amount. Fur thermore, an oxidizing agent interacts with hydrogen to shift the thermodynamic equilibrium of the dehy drogenation reaction toward the formation of olefins.
In the presence of oxygen, the process becomes exo thermic and occurs at lower temperatures than direct dehydrogenation. However, the selectivity of the for mation of olefins in this process is not very high as a result of the partial deep oxidation of paraffins and, to a larger degree, olefins.
The use of CO2 makes it possible to increase the process selectivity and the stability of catalysts. Car bon dioxide is contained in mine gases in considerable quantities. The joint use of paraffins and carbon diox ide in one process makes oxidative dehydrogenation attractive for its industrial implementation. Supported chromium catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of lower paraffins in the presence of CO2. The best supports of chromium catalysts in the dehydrogena tion of propane are silica gel [19] and mesoporous zeolites and silicalites [8, 1015]. The advantages of these carriers are low acidity and relative stability of the obtained catalysts to polymerization and coke deposition.
The introduction of alkaline promoters into chro mium oxide catalysts is one of the ways of increasing the effectiveness of them. It was shown [1619] that the introduction of alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs) rendered a positive action on the dehydrogenation of C3C4 paraffins in the presence of O2. Publications on the study of the influence of promoters in the dehy drogenation of lower paraffins in the presence of CO2 are scanty [2, 6]. Wang et al. [2] found that the intro duction of Li2O, Na2O, and K2O suppresses the cata lytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 in the dehydrogenation of ethane. Ge et al. [6] also studied the dehydrogenation of propane on CrOx/SiO2 with the additives of alkaline and alkalineearth promoters (K, Mg, Ca, Ba, Fe, and Ni). The best promoter was K, and its content changed from 0.1 to 1.0% (by weight). The optimum potassium content of the 5% CrOx/SiO2 catalyst was 0.20.4%.
At these K concentrations in the catalyst, the selectiv ity of the formation of propene was 100% at a 22% conversion of propane. Ge et al. [6] did not conducted detailed studies of the stability of the catalyst, and the operating time was limited by 3 h.

For studying the influence of the hydroxyl cover of chromium oxide catalysts upon the introduction of alkaline promoters on the dehydrogenation of propane, IR spectroscopy was used.
Chromium catalysts were prepared by the impreg nation of commercial silica gel (KSKG, 374 m2/g) with aqueous solutions of Cr(NO3)3 9H2O. The chromium contents were 2.0, 3.0, and 5.0 wt %. The promoted catalysts were prepared by the simultaneous impregnation of silica gel with aqueous solutions of Cr(NO3)3  9H2O and the compounds containing Li, Na, and K: LiOHH2O, NaNO3, and KNO3. The concentrations of promoters were varied from 0.06 to
0.31 wt % for obtaining equal molar concentrations.
The composition of the initial reaction mixture was the following, vol %: C3H8 (15), CO2 (30), and N2 (55). The longterm tests were conducted in a flow setup at 600C, a space velocity of 200 h1, and atmo spheric pressure. The reaction mixture was analyzed by chromatography on the following two columns:molecular sieves 5 A (H2, N2, CH4, and CO) and Pora pak Q (CO2 and C1C3 hydrocarbons). The catalysts were regenerated in a flow of O2 at 350400C for 2 h and then at 600 C for 10 h.
The IRspectroscopic studies of the catalysts were performed on a Nikolet Protege Fourier transform spectrometer.
Figure 1 shows the time dependences of (a) the conversion of propane and (b) the yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane on the catalyst Cr(2.0%)Ox/SiO2.

Indeed, the amount of methane formed at the first moment (for 30 min) on the fresh catalyst (7.4 vol %) was greater than that on regenerated samples (5.8 and 5.0% after the first and second regenerations, respectively). After the first regeneration, the time of the maximum yield of propene was 200 min. By this time, methanation also decreased. The catalyst operation was stable: the yield of propene was at a level of 44% after 15 h of pass ing the reaction mixture on both fresh and regenerated samples. Figure 2 shows the curves of changes in (a) the conversion of propane and (b) the yield of propene with time in the dehydrogenation of propane on the chromium oxide catalysts with the addition of lithium (0.06 and 0.2% Li). In contrast to the unpromoted cat alyst, the addition of even a small quantity of lithium (0.06%) led to an increase in the rate of deactivation and a decrease in the stability; in this case, the activity was not restored completely after oxidation in a flow of O2 for 10 h. As the Li content was increased to 0.2%, a further decrease in the activity and an increase in the rate of catalyst deactivation occurred. However, the initial yield of propene (at 30 min) on a promoted
0.06% Li catalyst was higher than that on an unpro
moted sample as a result of a decrease in the methana tion (5.2% after 30 min of tests).

Vol. 46 No. 1 2012 EFFECT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKALINE PROMOTERS 17 the lowest activity; in this case, the yield of propene at the initial moment of time was sufficiently high (Fig. 3), and it was higher than a maximum on Cr(2.0%)Ox/SiO2 and r(2.0%)Li(0.06%)/SiO2. It is obvious that this result is connected with a compar atively low methanation, which little changed after regeneration (3.8% on the fresh catalyst or 3.4 and
3.1% after the first and second regenerations, respec
tively). This catalyst strongly changed its properties after the second regeneration; in this case, not only the activity decreased, but also the rate of deactivation increased. This is especially noticeable in the curves of the yield of propene (Fig. 3b).
The introduction of potassium in an equimolar quantity in comparison with lithium and sodium did not lead to a so strong decrease in the activity and sta bility of chromium oxide catalysts. Figure 4 shows the time dependences of the conversion of propane and yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane on the r(2.0%)K(0.31%)/SiO2 catalyst. It is evident that catalyst activity was somewhat lower than that of the unpromoted sample (Fig. 1a); nevertheless, it increased after the first regeneration, and the catalyst began to work more stably. Its activity decreased after the second regeneration, but it remained higher than that for the fresh catalyst. The yield of propene on the r(2.0%)K(0.31%)/SiO2 catalyst after the first regeneration was higher than that on the fresh sample and higher than that on the unpromoted sample, but it became lower than that on r(2.0%)/SiO2 after the second regeneration. Potassium introduced into the chromium oxide catalyst suppressed the formation of methane to a lesser degree (5.6% on the fresh catalyst or 4.8% after the first and second regenerations) than Li and Na. 90 70 50 300 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Time, min Propane conversion, % 200 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Time, min 30 40 50 60 Yield of propene, % After the second regeneration After the first regeneration Fresh (a) (b) Fig. 3.

After the 5h tests of catalysts after the second regeneration, the yields of propene remained unchanged on the unpromoted catalyst, decreased only slightly on the sample with potassium, and decreased strongly on the catalyst with sodium. The last sample was characterized by the smallest cracking:thus, in a steady state, the methane contents after the first and second regenerations were 3.1 and 1.5%,respectively. The activity of this catalyst was not restored after the regeneration. The comparison of the selectivity for propene formation at a constant conver sion of propane (60%) for the studied catalysts showed that the catalyst containing potassium was character ized by the greatest selectivity, but its stability was lower than that of the unpromoted sample.

Vol. 46 No. 1 2012 LAPIDUS et al. the chromium oxide catalysts with the high Cr con tents: 5.0 and 3.0%. On the fresh Cr(5.0%)/SiO2 catalyst, the conversion of propane exceeded 90% and very slowly decreased to 70% for 20 h. The yield of propene was sufficiently stable: is was at a level of about 45% after the operation of the fresh and regen erated catalysts for 20 h. Figure 5 shows the time dependence of (a) the conversion of propane and (b) the yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of pro pane on the r(5.0%)K(0.30%)/SiO2 catalyst. On this catalyst,in contrast to the Cr(2.0%)K(0.31%)Ox/SiO2 catalyst, the conversion of propane decreased after the first and second regenera tions, and the yield of propene increased after the first regeneration and rapidly decreased after the second regeneration, and it became lower than that on the fresh catalyst. Table 2 summarizes the experimental results. As can be seen, the introduction of potassium in this case did not lead to an increase in the yield of propene. The catalyst with 2.0% Cr and the same potassium content worked more stably: after the third regeneration, the yield of propene on it was 45%.
Thus, the promotion of catalyst with 5.0% Cr by potassium did not exert a positive effect on its proper ties. Figure 6 shows the time dependence of the con version of propane and the yield of propene on the r(3.0%)K(0.15%)/SiO2 catalyst. It is evident that,after the first, second, and third regenerations, the sample lost the overall activity, although the yield of propene at the initial moment of time increased, obvi 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 30 50 70 90 Propane conversion, % Time, min After the second regeneration After the third regeneration (a) 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 20 30 Time, min After the second regeneration 40 50 60 Yield of propene, % After the third regeneration After the first regeneration Fresh (b) Fresh After the first regeneration Fig. 6.

Vol. 46 No. 1 2012 EFFECT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF ALKALINE PROMOTERS 21 ously, due to a decrease in cracking and coke deposi tion. At the same time, it can be seen that, after 400 min, the yields of propene became equal (45%) on the fresh and regenerated samples. Methanation on this catalyst was more intense than on the r(2.0%)K(0.31%)/SiO2 catalyst. Table 3 compares the yields of propene at different stages in the opera tion of the r(3.0%)/SiO2 and r(3.0%)K(0.15%)/SiO2 catalysts. In this case, the introduction of potassium led to a considerable increase in the stability of the catalyst in comparison with the unpromoted sample, which manifested itself in the course of the longterm tests of the catalysts (60 h). Thus, the positive role of potassium was discovered at the ratio Cr : K = 20 on the catalyst containing 3.0% chromium and at the ratio Cr : K = 6.5 on the catalyst with 2.0%. The chromium content should not be higher than 3.0% since the catalysts with high chro mium contents are irreversibly deactivated. The deac tivation of the catalyst containing 2.0% chromium is caused only by the formation of coke, and it is com pletely reversible.
For studying the influence of the hydroxyl cover of chromium oxide catalysts upon the introduction of alkali metals, the prepared catalysts were studied by IR spectroscopy. Figure 7 shows data obtained for the cat alysts with a chromium content of 2.0% without addi tives and with the additions of alkali metals. It is evi dent that the spectra exhibited two regions, at 3750 cm1 due to free hydroxyls and the second range (37203500 cm1) due to hydrogenbonded hydrox yls. The greater the surface concentration of hydrox yls, the higher the concentration of hydroxyls bound to each other. Upon the introduction of alkali metals,

Vol. 46 No. 1 2012 LAPIDUS et al. a part of protons in hydroxyls is replaced by the ions of these metals. The more actively the alkaline ion replaces protons in hydroxyls, the lower the possibility of the formation of hydrogen bonds between hydrox yls. This makes it possible to study the influence of the hydroxyl cover of catalysts on the effectiveness (activ ity and stability) of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.
Figure 7 indicates that the introduction of K, Li,and Na leads to a decrease in the relative intensity of absorption bands that characterize bound hydroxyls.
This relative intensity is considerably lower than the intensity of bands due to free hydroxyls on the chro mium catalysts with Li and Na. These catalysts exhib ited the greatest drop in the activity and, especially,stability in the dehydrogenation of propane; that is,the more actively the alkali metal replaces protons in hydroxyls, the greater the degree to which the activity and stability of catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane decreases. These data suggest that the hydroxyl cover of chromium oxide catalysts plays an important role in the dehydrogenation of lower paraf fins.
Thus, in this work, we found that the introduction of potassium into the chromium oxide catalysts can be effective for increasing their stability and selectivity.
On the catalyst containing 2.0% Cr and 0.31% K, the yield of propene was at a high level for 60 h, and the selectivity of the formation of propene on it was higher than on the chromium oxide catalyst without K.
Potassium (0.15%) improved the stability of the chro mium oxide catalyst containing 3.0% Cr. Using IR spectroscopy, we found that the decrease in the con centration of surface hydroxyls in the chromium oxide catalysts led to a decrease in their activity and stability in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence
CO2.
