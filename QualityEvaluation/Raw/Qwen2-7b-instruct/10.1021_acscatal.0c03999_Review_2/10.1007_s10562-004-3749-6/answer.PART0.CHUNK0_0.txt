[1] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation."
[2] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The effect of the chromium loading level (0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr) on the poisoning/promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of yield in He to the yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) is shown in figure 5."

Promoters, specifically CO2, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by changing the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. This alteration enhances CO2 activation and improves the oxidizing ability of the system. Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, CO2 provides specific advantages by selectively enhancing propene yield on CrOx/SiO2 catalysts while avoiding detrimental effects on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The chromium loading level also impacts the poisoning/promoting effect of CO2, with higher loading levels affecting the catalyst differently depending on the support material.

促进剂，特别是二氧化碳，通过改变CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸碱性来解决二氧化碳弱氧化能力弱和惰性的局限性。这种改变增强了二氧化碳的激活并提高了系统的氧化能力。与替代策略如氧气共供相比，二氧化碳提供了特定优势，通过在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上选择性地增强丙烯产率，同时避免对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的不利影响。铬负载量也影响了二氧化碳的毒害/促进效果，随着负载量的增加，催化剂在不同支持材料上的反应有所不同。
