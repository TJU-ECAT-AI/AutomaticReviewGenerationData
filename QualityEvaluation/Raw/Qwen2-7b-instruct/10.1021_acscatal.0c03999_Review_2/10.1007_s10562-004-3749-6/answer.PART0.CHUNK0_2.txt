[1] "In all cases the yield of propene increased with temperature, but the detailed behavior varied with a type of support and the feed composition."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[3] "Over the whole temperature range the yield of propene was higher in the presence of CO2 then its absence."
[4] "On the other hand, over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst carbon dioxide exerts an adverse effect on the yield and selectivity of propene."
[5] "However, Nakagawa et al. [16] suggested that in the dehydroge- nation of ethane with CO2, the decrease of the ethene yield over Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by modifica- tion of acidity of the catalyst surface with water."
[6] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, they allow for the selective and efficient conversion of CO2 into useful products. For instance, in the context of the study, the silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst promoted the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, increasing the yield of propene compared to its absence. Conversely, the aluminum oxide-supported catalyst showed an adverse effect on propene yield and selectivity when CO2 was present. This suggests that the nature of the support material significantly impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity towards the desired product. Additionally, the study indicates that increasing the chromium loading level on the silica-supported catalyst enhanced the promotion effect of CO2, while it had the opposite effect on the aluminum oxide-supported catalyst. This highlights the importance of the support material in determining the efficiency of CO2 utilization in chromium-based catalytic systems.

促进剂通过增强CO2的活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了CO2弱氧化潜力和惰性的局限性。具体来说，它们允许选择性且高效地将CO2转化为有用的产品。例如，在研究中，硅酸盐支持的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，提高了丙烯的产率，与CO2不存在的情况相比。相反，铝酸盐支持的催化剂在CO2存在时对丙烯产率和选择性产生了不利影响。这表明支持材料的性质显著影响了催化剂活性和目标产物的选择性。此外，研究显示，增加硅酸盐支持催化剂中的铬负载量增强了CO2的促进效果，而它在铝酸盐支持催化剂上的作用则相反。这强调了支持材料在确定CO2在铬基催化剂系统中利用效率方面的重要性。
