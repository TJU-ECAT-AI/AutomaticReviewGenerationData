[1] "In all cases the yield of propene increased with temperature, but the detailed behavior varied with a type of support and the feed composition."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[3] "CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, in chromium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 can react directly with hydrogen to form water gas (CO + H2O), thus removing hydrogen and suppressing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. This direct reaction pathway is more favorable over silica-supported catalysts compared to alumina-supported catalysts, which show a decrease in the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2. The change in acidity/basicity of the Al2O3 catalyst during the dehydrogenation process with CO2 is proposed as a reason for the difference in catalytic performance between silica and alumina supports.

促进剂通过增强CO2的活化、提高催化剂的氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了CO2的弱氧化电势和惰性在铬基催化系统中的限制。具体而言，在铬氧化物基催化剂中，CO2可以直接与氢反应生成水气（CO + H2O），从而去除氢并抑制催化剂表面的焦炭沉积。这种直接反应途径在硅基催化剂上比在氧化铝基催化剂上更为有利。在CO2存在下，氧化铝支持催化剂的丙烯产率和选择性显著降低。提出在脱氢过程与CO2过程中，催化剂表面的酸碱性质的变化是导致硅与氧化铝支持催化剂性能差异的原因。
