[1] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation."
[2] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The results obtained prove that the nature of support strongly influences on the effect of CO2 in the dehy- drogenation of propane."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by changing the acidity/basicity of the catalyst surface, specifically affecting the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. This allows for enhanced CO2 activation, improved oxidizing ability, and selective and stable catalytic performance. Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, promoters offer a more targeted approach to CO2 activation, optimizing the catalytic system's performance without requiring additional reactants.

促进剂通过改变催化剂表面的酸碱性，特别是影响CrOx/Al2O3催化剂，来解决CO2氧化潜力较弱和惰性的限制。这促进了CO2的活化，提高了氧化能力，并实现了选择性和稳定的催化性能。与O2共供等替代策略相比，促进剂提供了一种更针对性的方法来激活CO2，优化催化系统的性能，而无需额外的反应物。
