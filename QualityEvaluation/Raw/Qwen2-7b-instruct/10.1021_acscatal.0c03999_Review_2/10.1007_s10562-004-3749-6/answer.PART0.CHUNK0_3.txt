[1] "In the present work, we have studied the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 over chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on two very different oxide supports (SiO2 and Al2O3)."
[2] "Over the (3.4)CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation."

Promoters, such as CO2, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation and improving the oxidizing ability of the catalysts. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, as they can selectively and stably activate CO2, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. In particular, CO2 promotes the dehydrogenation of propane over chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on SiO2, while it has a detrimental effect on the same process over catalysts supported on Al2O3.

促进剂，如CO2，通过增强CO2的活化和提高催化剂的氧化能力，解决了CO2弱氧化潜能和惰性在铬基催化系统中的限制。与氧气共喂养等替代策略相比，它们提供了特定优势，因为它们可以选择性和稳定地激活CO2，从而实现更好的催化性能。特别是，CO2促进了SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂上的丙烷脱氢作用，而对相同过程在Al2O3支持的催化剂上则有不利影响。
