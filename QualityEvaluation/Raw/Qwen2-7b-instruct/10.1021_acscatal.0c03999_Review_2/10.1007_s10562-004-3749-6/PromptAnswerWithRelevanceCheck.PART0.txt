[1] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation."
[2] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[3] "The effect of the chromium loading level (0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr) on the poisoning/promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of yield in He to the yield in CO2 (YHe/YCO2) is shown in figure 5."

Promoters, specifically CO2, address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by changing the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. This alteration enhances CO2 activation and improves the oxidizing ability of the system. Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, CO2 provides specific advantages by selectively enhancing propene yield on CrOx/SiO2 catalysts while avoiding detrimental effects on CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The chromium loading level also impacts the poisoning/promoting effect of CO2, with higher loading levels affecting the catalyst differently depending on the support material.

促进剂，特别是二氧化碳，通过改变CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸碱性来解决二氧化碳弱氧化能力弱和惰性的局限性。这种改变增强了二氧化碳的激活并提高了系统的氧化能力。与替代策略如氧气共供相比，二氧化碳提供了特定优势，通过在CrOx/SiO2催化剂上选择性地增强丙烯产率，同时避免对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的不利影响。铬负载量也影响了二氧化碳的毒害/促进效果，随着负载量的增加，催化剂在不同支持材料上的反应有所不同。

[1] "In all cases the yield of propene increased with temperature, but the detailed behavior varied with a type of support and the feed composition."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[3] "CO2 does not promote dehydrogenation of propane over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[4] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, in chromium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 can react directly with hydrogen to form water gas (CO + H2O), thus removing hydrogen and suppressing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. This direct reaction pathway is more favorable over silica-supported catalysts compared to alumina-supported catalysts, which show a decrease in the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2. The change in acidity/basicity of the Al2O3 catalyst during the dehydrogenation process with CO2 is proposed as a reason for the difference in catalytic performance between silica and alumina supports.

促进剂通过增强CO2的活化、提高催化剂的氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了CO2的弱氧化电势和惰性在铬基催化系统中的限制。具体而言，在铬氧化物基催化剂中，CO2可以直接与氢反应生成水气（CO + H2O），从而去除氢并抑制催化剂表面的焦炭沉积。这种直接反应途径在硅基催化剂上比在氧化铝基催化剂上更为有利。在CO2存在下，氧化铝支持催化剂的丙烯产率和选择性显著降低。提出在脱氢过程与CO2过程中，催化剂表面的酸碱性质的变化是导致硅与氧化铝支持催化剂性能差异的原因。

[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[3] "Over the whole temperature range the yield of propene was higher in the presence of CO2 then its absence."
[4] "On the other hand, over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst carbon dioxide exerts an adverse effect on the yield and selectivity of propene."
[5] "However, Nakagawa et al. [16] suggested that in the dehydroge- nation of ethane with CO2, the decrease of the ethene yield over Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is caused by modifica- tion of acidity of the catalyst surface with water."
[6] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."

Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance. Specifically, they allow for the selective and efficient conversion of CO2 into useful products. For instance, in the context of the study, the silica-supported chromium oxide catalyst promoted the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, increasing the yield of propene compared to its absence. Conversely, the aluminum oxide-supported catalyst showed an adverse effect on propene yield and selectivity when CO2 was present. This suggests that the nature of the support material significantly impacts the catalytic activity and selectivity towards the desired product. Additionally, the study indicates that increasing the chromium loading level on the silica-supported catalyst enhanced the promotion effect of CO2, while it had the opposite effect on the aluminum oxide-supported catalyst. This highlights the importance of the support material in determining the efficiency of CO2 utilization in chromium-based catalytic systems.

促进剂通过增强CO2的活化、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，解决了CO2弱氧化潜力和惰性的局限性。具体来说，它们允许选择性且高效地将CO2转化为有用的产品。例如，在研究中，硅酸盐支持的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2存在下促进了丙烷的脱氢反应，提高了丙烯的产率，与CO2不存在的情况相比。相反，铝酸盐支持的催化剂在CO2存在时对丙烯产率和选择性产生了不利影响。这表明支持材料的性质显著影响了催化剂活性和目标产物的选择性。此外，研究显示，增加硅酸盐支持催化剂中的铬负载量增强了CO2的促进效果，而它在铝酸盐支持催化剂上的作用则相反。这强调了支持材料在确定CO2在铬基催化剂系统中利用效率方面的重要性。
