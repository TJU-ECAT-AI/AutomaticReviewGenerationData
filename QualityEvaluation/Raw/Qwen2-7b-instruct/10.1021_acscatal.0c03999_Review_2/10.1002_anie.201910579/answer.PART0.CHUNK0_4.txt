[1] "CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons has received significant attention in the scientific community owing to the possibility of reducing emissions of this greenhouse gas while producing fuels and chemicals."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that replacing CO with CO2 in the reaction feed does not lead to significant changes in product distribution over iron catalysts, suggesting that the metal is effective for both the FT and CO2-FT synthesis."
[3] "Effective catalysts should be active for both RWGS and FT synthesis. Among many catalytic materials that have been investigated for this process, iron is a promising candidate because of its activity for both steps of the reaction and cheap price."
[4] "However, there are several challenges associated with direct CO2 conversion into hydrocarbons, including thermodynamic limitations and catalyst poisoning."
[5] "We demonstrate that the close contact between the two phases promotes the reduction of iron oxide via a proximal hydrogen spillover effect, enabling the formation of the active iron/iron carbide phase for the reaction at significantly lower temperatures than in iron oxide catalysts."
[6] "Furthermore, by engineering coreshell structures with a thin iron oxide shell, we achieved a fourfold increase in the hydrocarbon yield compared to the heterodimers."

The limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems are addressed by using promoters to enhance CO2 activation, improve the oxidizing ability, and achieve selective and stable catalytic performance. Promoters enable the reduction of iron oxide phases via hydrogen spillover from the nearby noble metal phase, leading to the formation of active iron/iron carbide phases at lower temperatures. This process facilitates CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons more efficiently. By controlling the thickness of the iron oxide shell in coreshell structures, the hydrocarbon yield can be increased by up to four times compared to heterodimer catalysts.

在铬基催化系统中，二氧化碳的弱氧化潜力和惰性通过使用促进剂来增强二氧化碳的激活、提高氧化能力以及实现选择性和稳定的催化性能来解决。促进剂通过氢溢出效应从附近的贵金属相促进铁氧化物相的还原，形成活性铁/铁碳化物相在较低温度下。这一过程使二氧化碳氢化为烃类更加有效。通过控制芯壳结构中氧化铁壳层的厚度，与异聚体催化剂相比，烃类产量可以增加四倍以上。
