[1] "Ruthenium promotes reduction of iron oxide in rutheniumiron oxide heterodimers by a proximal hydrogen spillover effect, leading to the formation of rutheniumiron coreshell structures active for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons."
[2] "Tuning the shell thickness leads to a fourfold increase in hydrocarbon yield."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The use of ruthenium as a promoter in iron oxide-based catalysts enhances the reduction of iron oxide through a hydrogen spillover effect, resulting in the formation of active rutheniumiron coreshell structures for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. By adjusting the thickness of the iron oxide shell, the hydrocarbon yield can be increased by four times compared to the original heterodimer structure.

在铁氧化物基催化剂中使用钌作为促进剂，通过邻近的氢溢出效应促进了铁氧化物的还原，从而形成了活性的钌铁内壳结构，用于CO2向烃类的氢化。通过调整铁氧化物壳层的厚度，烃类产率可以比原始异质体结构增加四倍。
