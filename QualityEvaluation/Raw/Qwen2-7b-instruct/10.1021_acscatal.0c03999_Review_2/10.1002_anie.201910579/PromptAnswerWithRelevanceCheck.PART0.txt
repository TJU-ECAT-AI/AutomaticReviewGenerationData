[1] "The catalytic activity of the heterodimer catalyst was compared to various control catalysts to determine how the interaction of ruthenium and iron oxide phases affects their properties."
[2] "In a first catalytic test, all catalysts were reduced at 300C in pure H2 and tested for CO2 hydrogenation at 6bar and 300C in a 3:1 mixture of H2/CO2."
[3] "We observed that once ruthenium promotes the reduction of iron oxide and a coreshell structure is formed, the catalytic activity of the heterodimers is similar to that of pure iron oxide."
[4] "Based on this knowledge, we prepared Ru/FeOx coreshell nanoparticles with an average shell thickness of 1.2nm directly from colloidal synthesis."
[5] "Interestingly, the coreshell nanoparticles with much thinner shell made significantly more hydrocarbons compared to the heterodimers at similar conversion."

This study investigates the synergistic effect of ruthenium and iron oxide in heterodimer catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. The researchers found that the close contact between the two phases promotes the reduction of iron oxide, leading to the formation of active iron/iron carbide phase. By engineering the iron oxide shell thickness, they achieved a fourfold increase in hydrocarbon yield compared to the heterodimers. The results demonstrate that rational design of colloidal heterostructures can significantly enhance the catalytic performance in CO2 conversion processes.

[1] "Effective catalysts should be active for both RWGS and FT synthesis."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that replacing CO with CO2 in the reaction feed does not lead to significant changes in product distribution over iron catalysts, suggesting that the metal is effective for both the FT and CO2-FT synthesis."

The use of promoters in CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by facilitating its activation through hydrogen spillover from the nearby noble metal. This approach offers specific advantages over alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, as it enhances CO2 activation, improves the oxidizing ability, and achieves selective and stable catalytic performance. The promoters enable the formation of active iron/iron carbide phases at lower temperatures, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity.

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters like ruthenium in the form of heterodimer structures with iron are utilized. These structures allow for the promotion of the iron phase, enhancing CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability. Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, the use of rutheniumiron oxide heterodimers offers several advantages. Specifically, they enable selective and stable catalytic performance by facilitating the reduction of iron oxide through hydrogen spillover from the proximal ruthenium phase. This proximity between the two metals promotes the formation of active iron phases, resulting in a fourfold increase in hydrocarbon yield. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the transformation of heterodimers into rutheniumiron coreshell structures, which exhibit superior catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. This method represents a novel and efficient strategy for CO2 conversion, offering improvements over traditional approaches.
