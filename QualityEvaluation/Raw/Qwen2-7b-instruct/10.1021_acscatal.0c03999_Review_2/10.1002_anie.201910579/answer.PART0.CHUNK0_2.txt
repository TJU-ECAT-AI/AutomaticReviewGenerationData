[1] "Among many catalytic materials that have been investigated for this process, iron is a promising candidate because of its activity for both steps of the reaction and cheap price."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that replacing CO with CO2 in the reaction feed does not lead to significant changes in product distribution over iron catalysts, suggesting that the metal is effective for both the FT and CO2-FT synthesis."
[3] "For this reason, iron has been the subject of many investigations aimed at improving its performance for CO2 hydrogenation."
[4] "However, there are several challenges associated with direct CO2 conversion into hydrocarbons, including thermodynamic limitations and catalyst poisoning."
[5] "Effective catalysts should be active for both RWGS and FT synthesis."
[6] "It has been reported that reduction of alumina-impregnated ruthenium and iron salts leads to formation of both Fe/Ru alloys and segregated iron nanoparticles."
[7] "The heterodimers were then deposited onto γ-Al2O3 support, and the organic ligands removed using a fast calcination treatment."
[8] "Furthermore, by engineering coreshell structures with a thin iron oxide shell, we achieved a fourfold increase in hydrocarbon yield compared to the heterodimers."
[9] "The fact that the physical mixture only produced CO and CH4, while the Ru/Fe2O3/Al2O3 heterodimer catalyst formed hydrocarbons (Figure2a) demonstrates the importance of proximity between ruthenium and iron oxide phases."

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters like ruthenium in the form of heterodimer structures with iron are utilized. These structures allow for the promotion of the iron phase, enhancing CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability. Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, the use of rutheniumiron oxide heterodimers offers several advantages. Specifically, they enable selective and stable catalytic performance by facilitating the reduction of iron oxide through hydrogen spillover from the proximal ruthenium phase. This proximity between the two metals promotes the formation of active iron phases, resulting in a fourfold increase in hydrocarbon yield. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the transformation of heterodimers into rutheniumiron coreshell structures, which exhibit superior catalytic activity for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. This method represents a novel and efficient strategy for CO2 conversion, offering improvements over traditional approaches.

为了克服二氧化碳氧化势弱和惰性在铬基催化剂系统中的局限性，使用如铁与钌形成的异质二聚体结构作为促进剂。这些结构能够促进铁相的活性，增强二氧化碳的激活并提升氧化能力。与氧气共供给等其他策略相比，钌铁氧化物异质二聚体的使用提供了几个优势。具体而言，它们通过近邻钌相的氢溢出促进铁氧化物的还原，从而实现了选择性和稳定的催化性能。这种接近度使两种金属之间形成活性铁相成为可能，导致四倍于原始异质二聚体的烃类产率提升。这种方法的有效性通过将异质二聚体转化为钌铁核壳结构得到证明，这些结构表现出对二氧化碳氢化为烃类的优异催化活性。这种方法代表了一种新颖且高效的二氧化碳转化策略，相较于传统方法提供了改进。
