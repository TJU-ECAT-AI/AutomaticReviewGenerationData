[1] "Effective catalysts should be active for both RWGS and FT synthesis."
[2] "It has been demonstrated that replacing CO with CO2 in the reaction feed does not lead to significant changes in product distribution over iron catalysts, suggesting that the metal is effective for both the FT and CO2-FT synthesis."
[3] "We demonstrate that the close contact between the two phases promotes the reduction of iron oxide via a proximal hydrogen spillover effect, enabling the formation of the active iron/iron carbide phase for the reaction at significantly lower temperatures than in iron oxide catalysts."
[4] "Furthermore, by engineering coreshell structures with a thin iron oxide shell, we achieved a fourfold increase in hydrocarbon yield compared to the heterodimers."

The use of promoters in CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons addresses the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness by facilitating its activation through hydrogen spillover from the nearby noble metal. This approach offers specific advantages over alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, as it enhances CO2 activation, improves the oxidizing ability, and achieves selective and stable catalytic performance. The promoters enable the formation of active iron/iron carbide phases at lower temperatures, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity.
