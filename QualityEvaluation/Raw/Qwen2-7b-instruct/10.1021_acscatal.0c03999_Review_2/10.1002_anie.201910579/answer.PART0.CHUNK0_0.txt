[1] "The catalytic activity of the heterodimer catalyst was compared to various control catalysts to determine how the interaction of ruthenium and iron oxide phases affects their properties."
[2] "In a first catalytic test, all catalysts were reduced at 300C in pure H2 and tested for CO2 hydrogenation at 6bar and 300C in a 3:1 mixture of H2/CO2."
[3] "We observed that once ruthenium promotes the reduction of iron oxide and a coreshell structure is formed, the catalytic activity of the heterodimers is similar to that of pure iron oxide."
[4] "Based on this knowledge, we prepared Ru/FeOx coreshell nanoparticles with an average shell thickness of 1.2nm directly from colloidal synthesis."
[5] "Interestingly, the coreshell nanoparticles with much thinner shell made significantly more hydrocarbons compared to the heterodimers at similar conversion."

This study investigates the synergistic effect of ruthenium and iron oxide in heterodimer catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. The researchers found that the close contact between the two phases promotes the reduction of iron oxide, leading to the formation of active iron/iron carbide phase. By engineering the iron oxide shell thickness, they achieved a fourfold increase in hydrocarbon yield compared to the heterodimers. The results demonstrate that rational design of colloidal heterostructures can significantly enhance the catalytic performance in CO2 conversion processes.
