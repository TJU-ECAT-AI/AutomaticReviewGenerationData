[1] "Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the surface properties and stability of the catalyst."
[2] "Specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding include improved CO2 activation, enhanced oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance."
