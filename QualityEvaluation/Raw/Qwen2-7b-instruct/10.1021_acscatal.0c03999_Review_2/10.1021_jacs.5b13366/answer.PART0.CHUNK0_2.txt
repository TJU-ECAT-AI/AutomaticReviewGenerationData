<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters tackle the challenges posed by CO2's low reactivity and lack of reactivity in chromium-based catalysts. They offer several benefits compared to other methods such as oxygen co-feeding, including improved activation of CO2, enhanced oxidizing capability, and the attainment of both selectivity and stability in the catalytic process.
