[1] "To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness, promoters such as K+, Rb+, and Cs+ can play a crucial role. They promote both the activity and the selectivity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts."
[2] "Promoters increase the dispersion of the active phase by assisting the formation under oxidizing conditions of Cr6+ complexes that subsequently give rise to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere."
[3] "For some materials, doping with K+ results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. This indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or in the desorption of hydrogen."
[4] "Promoters offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance."

对于CO2的弱氧化潜力和惰性，促进剂如K+、Rb+和Cs+能发挥关键作用。它们通过促进活性相的分散并协助在氧化条件下形成Cr6+复合物，在还原气氛下转化为Cr3+来提高催化剂活性和选择性。它们增强CO2激活和催化性能，并提供与共喂养O2相比在选择性和稳定催化活性方面的优势。
