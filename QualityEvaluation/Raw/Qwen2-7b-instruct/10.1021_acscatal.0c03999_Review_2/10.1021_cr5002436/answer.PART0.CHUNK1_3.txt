[1] "Despite the excellent performance of Pt and CrOx catalysts in paraffin dehydrogenation, a number of issues including catalyst poisoning, the high cost of Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of Cr have spurred the search for alternatives."

[3] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
[4] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[5] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
[6] "When the coke is removed through the calcination of the catalyst, the latter may deactivate further as vanadium oxide species sinter and form larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides such as AlVO4, both of which are less active."

1. Alternative catalysts to Pt and CrOx were sought due to issues like catalyst poisoning, high Pt cost, and environmental concerns associated with Cr usage in paraffin dehydrogenation.

2. Vanadium oxides are active in hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation.

3. The type of vanadium species present on the catalyst surface is influenced by the surface area-to-metal loading ratio.

4. Monomeric vanadium species dominate at low loadings, while polymeric species and V2O5 crystallites are predominant at intermediate and high loadings, respectively.

5. Large V2O5 crystallites are inactive in dehydrogenation reactions.

6. Calcination of the catalyst can lead to further deactivation due to sintering of vanadium oxide species into less active forms like AlVO4.

7. Treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C can revert V2O5 crystallites to active polymeric vanadium species.

8. Weak basic sites on carriers like activated carbon support catalysts enhance the reverse water gas shift reaction, increasing alkane conversion.

9. Molybdenum oxide catalysts deactivate quickly due to coking and offer low conversion and selectivity.

10. The first report of a molybdenum oxide-based catalyst for dehydrocyclization of n-heptane was published in 1946.

11. Compared to bulk MoO3 and MoO3 supported on other materials, MoO3/SiC offers higher selectivities and stability, albeit with lower conversion.

1. 由于铂中毒、铂高成本和Cr在烷烃脱氢中使用的环境问题，寻找替代催化剂以解决这些问题。

2. 钒氧化物在烃氧化反应中活性，包括脱氢。

3. 催化剂表面的钒物种类型由表面积与金属负载比决定。

4. 在低负载时，主要存在单体钒物种；而在中等和高负载时，聚集体物种和V2O5晶粒占据主导地位。

5. 大型V2O5晶粒在脱氢反应中不活跃。

6. 热解催化剂可能导致进一步失活，因为范德华氧化物物种聚合成活性较低的形式如AlVO4。

7. 在600°C的氧气气氛下处理催化剂可以将V2O5晶粒还原为活性聚集体钒物种。

8. 比如，活性炭载体催化剂上的较弱碱性位点促进逆水煤气变换反应，增加烷烃转化率。

9. 钼氧化物催化剂快速失活，导致低转化率和选择性。

10. 1946年首次报道钼氧化物基催化剂用于n-庚烷的脱氢环化。

11. 相比于其他材料支持的钼氧化物，钼氧化物/SiC提供更高的选择性和稳定性，尽管转化率较低。
