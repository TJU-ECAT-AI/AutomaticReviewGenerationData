[1] "Promoters such as potassium, sodium, or cesium can enhance the activity of chromium-based catalysts by increasing their oxidizing ability. They accomplish this by donating electrons to the chromium species, preventing their reduction and maintaining their high oxidation state."
[2] "In chromium-based systems, promoters like potassium can stabilize the active phase by forming compounds such as KCrO2, which donate electrons to the active chromium species and prevent their reduction."
[3] "Compared to alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding, the addition of promoters offers several advantages. It can enhance the activation of CO2, leading to more efficient use of the CO2 resource. Promoters can improve the overall oxidizing ability of the catalyst, leading to better selectivity towards desired products. Additionally, they can contribute to the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions."

Promoters like potassium, sodium, or cesium can boost the activity of chromium-based catalysts by increasing their oxidizing capability. They do this by donating electrons to the chromium species, which prevents their reduction and keeps them in a high oxidation state. Compared to strategies like feeding in oxygen, using promoters offers benefits such as enhancing the activation of carbon dioxide, improving the efficiency of the CO2 resource, and boosting the overall oxidizing power of the catalyst. This leads to better selectivity towards desired products and contributes to the stability of the catalyst under reaction conditions.

如钾、钠或铯等促进剂可以提高铬基催化剂的活性，通过增加其氧化能力。它们通过向铬物种捐赠电子来实现这一目标，防止其被还原并保持其高氧化状态。与氧气共供给等替代策略相比，使用促进剂具有优势，如增强二氧化碳的激活，提高资源的利用效率；提升催化剂的整体氧化能力，从而提高目标产物的选择性；并有助于在反应条件下催化剂的稳定性。
