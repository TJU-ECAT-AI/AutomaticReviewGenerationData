[1] "To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, promoters such as alkali metals (K, Rb, Cs) can be used. They promote both activity and selectivity by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites."
[2] "Promoters like alkali metals can assist in the formation of Cr6+ complexes under oxidizing conditions that convert to Cr3+ under reducing atmospheres, improving dispersion of the active phase."
[3] "For certain chromium-based catalysts, doping with K+ can dramatically decrease catalytic activity. This indicates that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or the desorption of hydrogen."

Promoters such as alkali metals can address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, increasing the number of active chromium sites, and promoting the formation of active Cr3+ species under reducing atmospheres. However, doping with certain alkali metals like K+ can lead to a decrease in activity, possibly due to the altered properties of oxygen ions that hinder catalysis.

对于铬基催化系统中CO2氧化潜力较弱和惰性的限制，可以通过使用碱金属这样的促进剂来解决。它们通过稳定支撑结构、降低表面酸性、增加活性铬离子的数量以及在还原气氛下促进形成活性Cr3+物种来提高活性。然而，某些碱金属如钾的掺杂可能导致活性下降，这可能是因为氧离子性质的变化阻碍了催化作用。
