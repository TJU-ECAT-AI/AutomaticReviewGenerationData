[1] "CO2 can be used as a mild oxidant for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[2] "However, CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness limit its effectiveness in chromium-based catalytic systems."
[3] "Promoters, such as K+, Rb+, and Cs+, can address these limitations by promoting CO2 activation."
[4] "They improve the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, allowing for selective and stable catalytic performance."
[5] "Compared to O2 co-feeding, promoters enable the utilization of CO2 without compromising the stability and selectivity of the catalyst."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Promoters, such as potassium (K+), rubidium (Rb+), and cesium (Cs+), enhance CO2 activation and improve its oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems. This allows for selective and stable catalytic performance without the need for oxygen (O2) co-feeding, which can compromise stability and selectivity.

如钾（K+）、铷（Rb+）和铯（Cs+）这样的促进剂能够提升二氧化碳在铬基催化体系中的活化，增强其氧化能力。这使得催化剂能够在不损害稳定性和选择性的前提下实现选择性和稳定的催化性能，而无需使用氧气（O2）作为共供气体。
