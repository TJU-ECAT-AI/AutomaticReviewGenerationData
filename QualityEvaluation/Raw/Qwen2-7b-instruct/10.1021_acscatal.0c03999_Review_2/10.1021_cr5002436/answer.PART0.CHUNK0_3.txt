[1] "The global demand of propylene was 103 million tons that year and is expected to increase by 45% on a yearly basis."
[2] "Additionally, dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[3] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[4] "However, the reaction is thermodynamically limited and highly endothermic, which, according to Le Chateliers principle, implies that higher reaction temperature and/or lower paraffin partial pressure are needed to achieve high conversions."
[5] "An additional complicating factor is that olefins are considerably more reactive than their paraffinic counterparts, which can further lead to unwanted side and secondary reactions."

To address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems, alkali metals such as K, Rb, and Cs are used as promoters. They promote activity and selectivity by stabilizing the support structure, reducing surface acidity, and increasing the number of active chromium sites. They also assist in the formation of Cr6+ complexes under oxidizing conditions that convert to Cr3+ under a reducing atmosphere. This enhances CO2 activation and improves the oxidizing ability of the system. Compared to O2 co-feeding, alkali metal promoters offer advantages in achieving selective and stable catalytic performance without the need for additional oxygen sources, potentially reducing costs and environmental impacts. 

The introduction of alkali metals, especially potassium, in chromium-based catalysts can lead to a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. This is explained by the argument that oxygen ions play an active role in the dissociative adsorption of propane and/or in the desorption of hydrogen. Potassium forms bonds with oxygen anions, altering properties like Lewis acidity and coordinative unsaturation in a way that hinders catalysis. Sodium doping in chromia/zirconia catalysts does not exhibit this effect, unlike potassium doping in alumina-based formulations.

为了应对CO2氧化潜力较弱和惰性在铬基催化系统中的限制，使用诸如K、Rb和Cs这样的碱金属作为促进剂。它们通过稳定支持结构、降低表面酸度和增加活性铬离子的数量来促进活性和选择性。它们还帮助在氧化条件下形成Cr6+复合物，在还原气氛下转化为Cr3+。这增强了CO2的激活并改善了系统的氧化能力。与氧气共喂料相比，碱金属促进剂在实现选择性和稳定的催化性能方面提供了优势，无需额外的氧源，可能降低了成本和环境影响。

在铬基催化剂中引入碱金属，尤其是钾，会导致催化活性的显著下降。这种现象被解释为氧离子在丙烷的离散吸附和/或氢的脱附中扮演着活跃角色。钾与氧阴离子形成键，改变了诸如Lewis酸性以及协同饱和等性质，从而阻碍了催化作用。钠掺杂在铬氧化锆催化剂中没有表现出这种效果，与钾掺杂在硅铝酸盐基催化剂中的情况不同。
