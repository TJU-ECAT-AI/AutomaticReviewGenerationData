[1] "Promoters can help address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing CO2 activation, improving the oxidizing ability of the catalyst, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance."
[2] "In chromium-based systems, promoters such as potassium (K), sodium (Na), and lanthanum (La) can promote the formation of active oxygen species, such as peroxides and superoxides, which can more effectively activate CO2."
[3] "Promoters like potassium can stabilize the active phase of the catalyst by forming KFeO2, which donates electrons to the active iron species and prevents their reduction, thereby enhancing the stability of the catalyst."
[4] "The addition of promoters can also increase the acidity of the catalyst, which can improve the catalytic activity towards CO2 activation and the formation of active oxygen species."
[5] "Promoters can facilitate the selective activation of CO2 over other feedstocks, leading to higher yields of desired products and better selectivity."
[6] "Compared to alternative strategies such as O2 co-feeding, promoters offer the advantage of being more compatible with chromium-based catalysts, potentially reducing the risk of catalyst poisoning and maintaining stability over multiple reaction cycles."

促进剂可以解决二氧化碳氧化能力弱和惰性在铬基催化剂系统中的局限性，通过增强二氧化碳激活、提高催化剂的氧化能力并实现选择性和稳定的催化性能。例如钾、钠和镧等促进剂可以促进过氧化物和超氧等活性氧物种的形成，这些物种能更有效地激活二氧化碳。钾等促进剂可以通过形成KFeO2来稳定催化剂的活性相，向活性铁物种提供电子并阻止它们的还原，从而增强催化剂的稳定性。添加促进剂可以增加催化剂的酸性，改善CO2激活的催化活性和活性氧物种的形成。促进剂可以实现二氧化碳的选择性激活，导致所需产品的更高产率和更好的选择性。与替代策略如氧气共喂料相比，促进剂与铬基催化剂更为兼容，可能降低了催化剂中毒的风险，并在多个反应周期内保持稳定性。
