1. CO2 is utilized as a mild oxidant to enhance the dehydrogenation of light alkanes by promoting the activation of CO2, which then contributes to the overall catalytic process without completely oxidizing the chromium species.

2. CO2 is ineffective in oxidizing active Cr3+ species into inactive Cr5+ or Cr6+ species, but it can be beneficial when used as a mild oxidant.

3. Incorporating CO2 into the process as a mild oxidant helps improve the activity of chromium-based dehydrogenation catalysts. It achieves this by removing evolved hydrogen through the reverse water gas shift reaction, thus shifting the equilibrium towards product formation.

4. CO2 activation in this context involves using it as a mild oxidant to boost the performance of dehydrogenation catalysts without causing full oxidation of the chromium species.

1. 在轻烷烃的脱氢过程中，通过将二氧化碳用作温和氧化剂来利用二氧化碳，以促进二氧化碳的活化并进一步促进催化过程，同时不完全氧化铬物种。

2. 二氧化碳在催化活性的Cr3+物种转化为非活性的Cr5+或Cr6+物种中是无效的，但在作为温和氧化剂使用时，它对提高催化剂的性能是有益的。

3. 将二氧化碳引入过程中作为温和氧化剂使用，有助于提高基于铬的脱氢催化剂的活性。它通过反向水煤气变换反应去除生成的氢，从而促进产物形成，实现这一目的。

4. 在这种情况下，二氧化碳激活涉及将其用作温和氧化剂来提升脱氢催化剂的性能，而不会导致铬物种的完全氧化。
