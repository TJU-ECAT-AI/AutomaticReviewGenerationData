[1] "The presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."
[2] "Depending on the support, mixed oxides with Al, Zr, Ti, or Mg may be formed."
[3] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[4] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[5] "Higher initial catalytic activities were obtained in all cases, although the effect was strongest after reduction with CO."
[6] "Alumina is commonly used as a support for vanadium oxide catalysts, although Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[7] "Indeed, as was shown by Harlin et al., the performance of supported vanadium catalysts can be improved through the addition of MgO, either as a promoter or as a component of a mixed oxide."
[8] "Overall, MoO3 catalysts deactivate rapidly due to coking and generally afford a relatively low conversion and selectivity."
[9] "The addition of Sn to the Pt-based catalyst facilitates this migration by weakening the binding of the hydrocarbon to the metal."
[10] "Notably, the VOx-based catalysts show excellent yields (40%), albeit they deactivate very fast."

Promoters like MgO can enhance the activity of vanadium-based catalysts by improving stability and activity, especially when added to alumina supports. MgO can reduce coke formation and increase olefin selectivity by poisoning basic sites. This strategy offers advantages over O2 co-feeding as it maintains selectivity and stability without requiring additional oxygen supply. In chromium-based systems, promoters like MgO can similarly prevent deactivation by reducing coke formation.

The specific advantages of using promoters over O2 co-feeding include:

1. Maintaining high selectivity for olefin production without overoxidation of feedstocks.
2. Avoiding the complications of oxygen supply and potential overoxidation issues.
3. Preventing the need for additional equipment and operational complexity.
4. Enhancing catalyst stability and lifetime without compromising product quality.
5. Potentially achieving higher yields of desired olefins by optimizing promoter-catalyst interactions.

These benefits make promoters a more practical and efficient choice for enhancing CO2 activation and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance in comparison to O2 co-feeding strategies.

使用镁氧（MgO）等促进剂可以增强钒基催化剂的活性，尤其是在添加到氧化铝载体时。镁氧可以通过减少焦炭形成和增加烯烃选择性来提高稳定性与活性，特别是当其作为添加剂与氧化铝结合使用时。这种方法在氧气共供给策略上具有优势，因为它能够维持选择性而不发生过氧化，同时避免了氧气供应带来的复杂性和潜在的过氧化问题。在铬基系统中，镁氧等促进剂同样能够通过减少焦炭形成来防止催化剂失活。

使用促进剂相对于氧气共供给的优势包括：

1. 在不牺牲产品质量的情况下，保持高选择性生产烯烃。
2. 避免氧气供应的复杂性和可能的过氧化问题。
3. 无需额外设备和操作复杂性。
4. 通过优化促进剂-催化剂相互作用，增强催化剂稳定性和寿命。
5. 可能通过优化促进剂的添加量和催化剂组合，实现更高的目标烯烃产量。

这些好处使促进剂成为增强二氧化碳激活和实现选择性与稳定催化性能更实用、更有效的选择，相比于氧气共供给策略。
