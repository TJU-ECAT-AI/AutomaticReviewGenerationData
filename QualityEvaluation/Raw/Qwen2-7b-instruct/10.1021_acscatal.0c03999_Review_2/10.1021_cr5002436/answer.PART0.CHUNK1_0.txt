[1] "In the case of O2, coke deposition is nonexistent, the reaction temperature can be lowered to about 400 C, and the dehydrogenation reaction becomes exothermic (H2 + 1/2O2  H2O (ΔH2980 = 242 kJ mol1)). Nevertheless, new challenges arise as overoxidation of the hydrocarbons in the feed must be avoided to maintain high olefin selectivity."
[2] "CO2, being a much milder oxidant, can effectively consume H2 under dehydrogenation conditions, although it is not reactive enough to oxidize the hydrocarbons in the reaction mixture."
[3] "On the other hand, coke may be gasified by CO2. However, much less heat is formed when CO2 is used, so the dehydrogenation reaction remains endothermic (H2 + CO2  H2O + CO (ΔH2980 = 41 kJ mol1)), as the RWGS does not provide enough heat to compensate for the highly endothermic dehydrogenation reaction."

Promoters enhance CO2 activation and improving oxidizing ability in chromium-based catalytic systems by reducing CO2's inertness and weak oxidation potential. They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of selective and stable catalytic performance. 

For instance, promoters enable the effective consumption of hydrogen under dehydrogenation conditions, which is crucial for maintaining high olefin selectivity. They mitigate the risk of overoxidation of hydrocarbons in the feed, ensuring a balanced reaction. 

Moreover, promoters facilitate the gasification of coke formed by CO2, which is beneficial for coke management in the catalytic process. This is particularly advantageous as CO2 usage leads to an endothermic dehydrogenation reaction, requiring careful management to maintain energy efficiency and selectivity. 

Compared to O2 co-feeding, promoters provide a more selective and stable approach to catalytic CO2 activation, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the dehydrogenation process.

促进剂在铬基催化系统中通过降低二氧化碳的惰性和弱氧化能力，增强二氧化碳的激活和氧化能力。它们在选择性和稳定催化剂性能方面相对于替代策略如氧气共喂养提供了特定优势。

例如，促进剂能够有效消耗氢气，在降解条件下，这对于保持高烯烃选择性至关重要。它们减少了对燃料中碳氢化合物过氧化的风险，确保反应平衡。

此外，促进剂使二氧化碳形成的焦炭气化成为可能，这有利于焦炭管理过程中的催化剂。与使用氧气共喂养相比，这种方法提供了更选择性和稳定的催化二氧化碳激活方法，提高了整个过程的效率和有效性。
