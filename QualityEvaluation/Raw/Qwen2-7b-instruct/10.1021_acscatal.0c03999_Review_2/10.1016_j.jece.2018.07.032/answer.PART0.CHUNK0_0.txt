[1] "Promoters address the limitations of CO2's weak oxidation potential and inertness in chromium-based catalytic systems by enhancing the activity of these catalysts."
[2] "They offer specific advantages over alternative strategies like O2 co-feeding in terms of enhancing CO2 activation, improving oxidizing ability, and achieving selective and stable catalytic performance."
