Promoters tackle the challenges posed by CO2's low reactivity and inert nature in chromium-based catalysts by boosting CO2 activation, enhancing its oxidizing capacity, and ensuring both selectivity and stability in the catalytic process. Compared to methods such as oxygen co-feeding, promoters offer improved efficiency in CO2 utilization, higher selectivity for the desired products, and better durability under operational conditions.
