[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) have been tested for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
[3] "The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), and diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopic measurements."
[4] "Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of 52% with a high selectivity above 90% of styrene."
[5] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
[6] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[7] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[8] "The rate of CO formation during the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was well accounted for by assuming parallel occurrence of two reactions, i.e., direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and simple dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene thermodynamically assisted by reverse water-gas shift reaction."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts were tested for CO2-ODHP, and Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity and selectivity for producing styrene. XRD, N2 adsorption, and UVvis spectroscopic measurements were used to characterize the catalysts.

2. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrated high activity in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2, achieving 65% conversion and >90% styrene selectivity.

3. The structure of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts was characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption, and UVvis spectroscopy.

4. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts achieved 52% styrene yield with >90% selectivity in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation.

5. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by DHT showed high activity in CO2-ODHP, converting ethylbenzene to styrene with 65% conversion and >90% selectivity.

6. It was hypothesized that Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination acted as active monochromate species that were reduced to less active polychromate species in octahedral coordination during the reaction.

7. Deactivated Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were regenerated by oxygen treatment, with the reoxidation of reduced Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species observed.

8. The rate of CO formation during ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2 over Cr-MCM-41 was attributed to two parallel reactions: direct oxidative dehydrogenation and thermodynamically assisted dehydrogenation coupled with reverse water-gas shift reaction.
