[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) have been tested for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), and diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopic measurements."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%. It is suggested that Cr(VI)O4 in tetrahedral coordination is formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III)O6 in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "The deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen or CO2, during which redistribution as well as reoxidation of polymeric Cr(III)O6 octahedra to monomeric Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra was observed."
[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
[6] "Over the Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) catalyst in the present work, on the other hand, the formations of both benzene and toluene were more evident, whereas coke formation was negligibly small,compared with the reaction on the Fe catalyst."
[7] "It is considered that reverse water-gas shift reaction may proceed through a coupling of Cr(III) reduction to Cr(II) by H2 (3) and, inversely, Cr(II) oxidation to Cr(III) by CO2 (4) over Cr-MCM-41."
[8] "Assuming that CO forms by reverse water-gas shift reaction (2), the rate of CO formation would be equal to a decrease in the rate of H2 formation. The decrease in the rate of H2 formation was calculated based on the rate obtained by simple dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 (Fig. 6A)."
[9] "Moreover, reverse water-gas shift reaction was catalyzed over Cr-MCM-41, and the catalytic cycle is probably composed of the reductionoxidation between Cr(III) and Cr(II) species."
[10] "It is suggested that ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated to styrene directly with CO2 and also coupled by reverse water-gas shift reaction and that both reactions were catalyzed by the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(III) and Cr(II)."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts were tested for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 showing the highest activity, producing styrene with 65% conversion and >90% selectivity. Increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.% increased styrene formation rate, suggesting the formation of active monochromate species that were reduced to less active polychromate species.

2. The deactivated Cr-MCM-41 catalyst was regenerated by treatments with gaseous oxygen or CO2, indicating the reoxidation of reduced Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI).

3. Cr(VI) species formed in tetrahedral coordination as an active monochromate species and were reduced to less active octahedral coordination during the reaction.

4. The rate of CO formation was attributed to both reverse water-gas shift reaction and direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene by CO2, catalyzed by the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(III) and Cr(II) species.

5. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene was directly catalyzed by CO2, and was coupled with reverse water-gas shift reaction, both being catalyzed by the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(III) and Cr(II) species.

6. The activity of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts was influenced by factors such as metal loading, support properties, and the evolution of chromium species.

7. The catalytic cycle likely involved the reductionoxidation between Cr(III) and Cr(II) species.

8. The reverse water-gas shift reaction was catalyzed over Cr-MCM-41, and its occurrence was supported by the coupling of Cr(III) reduction to Cr(II) by H2 and inversely, Cr(II) oxidation to Cr(III) by CO2.

9. The deactivation of the Cr-MCM-41 catalyst was not caused by coke formation, despite the presence of reduced Cr(III) species and the regeneration of Cr(VI) species.

10. The direct oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 and the coupling by reverse water-gas shift reaction were both catalyzed by the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(III) and Cr(II) species.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂被测试用于CO2-ODHP，其中Cr-MCM-41表现出最高活性，产生苯乙烯，转化率为65%，选择性超过90%。随着Cr负载增加到1.7 wt.%，苯乙烯生成速率增加，表明形成作为活性单铬酸盐物种的Cr(VI)，这些物种随后被还原为活性较低的聚多铬酸盐物种。

2. 去活的Cr-MCM-41催化剂通过氧气或CO2的气体处理再生，显示还原的Cr(III)物种被氧化回Cr(VI)物种。

3. Cr(VI)物种以四面体配位形式形成作为活性单铬酸盐物种，并在反应中被还原为活性较低的八面体配位。
