          [1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) have been tested for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2."
          [2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [3] "The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), and diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopic measurements."
          [4] "Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of 52% with a high selectivity above 90% of styrene."
          [5] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%."
          [6] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

          Various metal oxide catalysts were tested for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity for producing styrene. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption, and UVvis spectroscopic measurements. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrated high activity in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2, achieving 65% conversion and >90% styrene selectivity. It was hypothesized that Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination acted as active monochromate species that were reduced to less active polychromate species in octahedral coordination during the reaction.

          对于CO2-ODHP，各种金属氧化物催化剂被测试，Cr-MCM-41催化剂显示出最高的活性和选择性来生成苯乙烯。使用XRD、N2吸附和UVvis光谱测量对催化剂进行了表征。Cr-MCM-41催化剂在以CO2为介质的乙基苯脱氢反应中表现出高活性，实现了65%的转化率和大于90%的苯乙烯选择性。假设在反应过程中，四面体配位的Cr(VI)物种作为活性单铬酸盐物种存在，并被还原为活性较低的八面体配位多铬酸盐物种。
