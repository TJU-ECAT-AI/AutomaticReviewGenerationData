The document indicates that among the M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis displayed the highest activity in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. These catalysts resulted in the production of styrene with a conversion rate of 65% and a selectivity exceeding 90%. The materials were characterized using X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, and diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopy. This highlights the effectiveness of Cr-MCM-41 in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions, with notable advantages in activity and selectivity compared to other metal oxide catalysts.
