1. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 was tested using various metal oxide catalysts, including Cr-MCM-41, Ga-MCM-41, V-MCM-41, and Fe-MCM-41. Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, producing styrene with a 65% conversion and selectivity above 90%. The activity of the catalysts generally increased with increasing chromium loading up to 1.7 wt%.

2. The selectivity to styrene on Cr-MCM-41 was consistently high (above 90%) regardless of the chromium content, whereas on MCM-41 without chromium, the selectivity was low.

3. The rate of styrene formation increased with the partial pressure of CO2, as the reverse water-gas shift reaction occurred over Cr-MCM-41, accelerating the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.

4. After treatment with oxygen, the tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 species were regenerated from the reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, demonstrating the catalyst's regenerability.

[5] "The rate of CO formation increased together with that of styrene formation, while the rate of H2 formation decreased, with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
[6] "Over the Cr-MCM-41 (Si/Cr = 50) catalyst in the present work, on the other hand, the formations of both benzene and toluene were more evident, whereas coke formation was negligibly small,compared with the reaction on the Fe catalyst."
[7] "It is considered that reverse water-gas shift reaction may proceed through a coupling of Cr(III) reduction to Cr(II) by H2 (3) and, inversely, Cr(II) oxidation to Cr(III) by CO2 (4) over Cr-MCM-41."
[8] "Assuming that CO forms by reverse water-gas shift reaction (2), the rate of CO formation would be equal to a decrease in the rate of H2 formation. The decrease in the rate of H2 formation was calculated based on the rate obtained by simple dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2 (Fig. 6A)."
[9] "Moreover, reverse water-gas shift reaction was catalyzed over Cr-MCM-41, and the catalytic cycle is probably composed of the reductionoxidation between Cr(III) and Cr(II) species."
[10] "It is suggested that ethylbenzene is dehydrogenated to styrene directly with CO2 and also coupled by reverse water-gas shift reaction and that both reactions were catalyzed by the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(III) and Cr(II)."
