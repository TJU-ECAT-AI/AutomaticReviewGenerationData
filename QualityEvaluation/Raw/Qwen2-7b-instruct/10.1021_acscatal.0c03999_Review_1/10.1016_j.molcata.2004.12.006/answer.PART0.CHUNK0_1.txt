[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) have been tested for dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K), and diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopic measurements."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of styrene with the conversion of 65% and the selectivity above 90%. The rate of styrene formation increased with increasing Cr loading up to 1.7 wt.%"
[3] "Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of 52% with a high selectivity above 90% of styrene. The order of the activities of these metals almost coincided with those observed over both M-MCM-41 [37,38] and diamond-supported metal catalysts [22] in the propane dehydrogenation."
[4] "Ethyl benzene conversion increased with increasing Cr content up to 1.7 wt.% (Si/Cr = 50), where the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores of MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of chromium."
[5] "The selectivity to styrene was low on MCM-41 without Cr and showed almost constant values above 90% over all Cr-MCM-41 irrespective of the Cr content."
[6] "The rate of styrene formation remarkably increased together with that of CO formation with increasing partial pressure of CO2."
[7] "After the treatment with O2, both XANES and EXAFS spectra showed that the Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra were regenerated by the reoxidation of the Cr(III)O6 octahedra."

1. The dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene with CO2 was tested using various metal oxide catalysts, including Cr-MCM-41, Ga-MCM-41, V-MCM-41, and Fe-MCM-41. Cr-MCM-41 demonstrated the highest activity, producing styrene with a 65% conversion and selectivity above 90%. The activity of the catalysts generally increased with increasing chromium loading up to 1.7 wt%.

2. The selectivity to styrene on Cr-MCM-41 was consistently high (above 90%) regardless of the chromium content, whereas on MCM-41 without chromium, the selectivity was low.

3. The rate of styrene formation increased with the partial pressure of CO2, as the reverse water-gas shift reaction occurred over Cr-MCM-41, accelerating the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.

4. After treatment with oxygen, the tetrahedrally coordinated Cr(VI)O4 species were regenerated from the reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, demonstrating the catalyst's regenerability.

1. 对于以CO2为辅助剂的乙基苯脱氢，测试了包括Cr-MCM-41、Ga-MCM-41、V-MCM-41和Fe-MCM-41在内的多种金属氧化物催化剂。Cr-MCM-41表现出最高活性，生产出的苯乙烯转化率为65%，选择性超过90%。在铬含量增加至1.7 wt%时，催化剂活性显著提高。

2. 不含铬的MCM-41中，苯乙烯的选择性很低，而Cr-MCM-41中，无论铬含量如何，苯乙烯的选择性始终保持在90%以上。

3. 随着CO2分压的增加，苯乙烯的形成速率也增加，因为在Cr-MCM-41上发生的逆水煤气变换反应加速了乙基苯的脱氢。

4. 在氧气处理后，四面体协调的Cr(VI)O4物种从还原的Cr(III)O6八面体中再生，表明催化剂具有可再生性。
