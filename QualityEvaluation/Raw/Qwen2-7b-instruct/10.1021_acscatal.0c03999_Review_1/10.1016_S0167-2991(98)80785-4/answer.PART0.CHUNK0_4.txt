[1] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."
[2] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The activity of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "These findings suggest that CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst."
[5] "And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2."

The various metal oxide catalysts compared in the study were Cr2O3 supported on A1203, active carbon, and SiO2. Among these, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts exhibited the most notable promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The CO2 promoted the yield of propylene and suppressed catalyst deactivation. Specifically, the activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst increased by 40% when CO2 was present, compared to its activity in the absence of CO2. Additionally, the presence of CO2 was found to maintain the surface of Cr2O3 partially oxidized, which contributed to the enhanced catalytic performance. This was also supported by the observation of smaller peaks in the TPR/D profiles of the catalyst treated with CO2, suggesting oxidation of the Cr2O3 surface.

在研究中比较的各种金属氧化物催化剂包括Cr2O3支持在A1203、活性碳和SiO2上。其中，SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯时表现出最显著的CO2促进效果。CO2提高了丙烯的产率，并抑制了催化剂的失活。具体来说，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在的条件下的活性比无CO2条件下提高了40%。此外，发现CO2能够维持Cr2O3表面部分氧化状态，这是增强催化性能的关键因素。这一结论也得到了TPR/D谱图中催化剂处理过CO2后观察到的小峰的证实，这些小峰表明Cr2O3表面的部分氧化。
