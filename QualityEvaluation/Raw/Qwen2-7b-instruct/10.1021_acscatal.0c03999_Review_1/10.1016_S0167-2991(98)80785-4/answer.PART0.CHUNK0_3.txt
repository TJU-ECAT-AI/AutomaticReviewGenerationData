1. The comparison of metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP shows that only SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts exhibit promoting effects of CO2. Specifically, CO2 enhances the yield of C3H6 and suppresses catalyst deactivation. This effect is attributed to the enhanced activity of partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 compared to a reduced catalyst. The key factor influencing the catalytic performance is the interaction between Cr203 and SiO2 particles, particularly at their boundaries where the promoting effects of CO2 occur.

2. The study investigated the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 over Cr203 catalysts supported on different materials, including Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. Carbon dioxide showed a promoting effect on the SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and delaying catalyst deactivation. The Cr203/SiO2 catalyst exhibited a 40% higher activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. The selectivities for CO and H2 did not vary with changes in C3H6 yield. CO2 significantly improved the yield of C3H6, and the ratio of C3H6 yield in the presence of CO2 to that in its absence decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the catalyst. The surface of Cr203 was found to be partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2, suggesting a protective role against catalyst deactivation.

3. The study on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 using Cr203 catalysts supported on different materials revealed that only SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts exhibited promoting effects of CO2. These effects included enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The promoting effect of CO2 on the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst was attributed to the maintenance of a partially oxidized state of the Cr203 surface during the reaction in the presence of CO2, leading to increased activity. The study further suggested that the promoting effects of CO2 occurred at the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Cr203/SiO2 system.

1. 对于不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳脱氢生产丙烯醇反应中的活性和选择性的比较，只有SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂显示出二氧化碳的促进效果。具体来说，二氧化碳能够提高丙烯醇的产率并抑制催化剂失活。这种效果归因于部分氧化态的Cr203在SiO2上的活性比还原态催化剂更高。影响催化性能的关键因素是Cr203与SiO2颗粒之间的相互作用，特别是它们的边界处，这是二氧化碳促进效果发生的地方。

2. 研究调查了不同材料上支持的Cr203催化剂（如Al2O3、活性炭和SiO2）对C3H8脱氢成C3H6的催化性能。二氧化碳仅在SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂中表现出促进作用，提高了丙烯醇的产率并延缓了催化剂的失活。Cr203/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下活性比二氧化碳不存在时高40%。对于CO和H2的选择性不随丙烯醇产率的变化而变化。二氧化碳显著提高了丙烯醇的产率，并且在存在二氧化碳的情况下，丙烯醇的产率与二氧化碳不存在时的比例随着Cr203含量的增加而降低。研究发现，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，Cr203表面被部分氧化，这可能起到了保护作用，防止催化剂失活。Cr203/SiO2催化剂表面的这种部分氧化状态被认为是其活性增强的原因。

3. 对于使用不同载体支持的Cr203催化剂进行C3H8脱氢为C3H6的研究揭示了仅SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂显示出二氧化碳的促进效果。这些效果包括提高丙烯醇的产率和抑制催化剂失活。二氧化碳对Cr203/SiO2催化剂的促进作用归因于在二氧化碳存在的条件下保持Cr203表面部分氧化状态，从而提高了活性。研究进一步表明，二氧化碳的促进效果发生在Cr203和SiO2颗粒的边界处，促进了Cr203/SiO2体系的催化性能。
