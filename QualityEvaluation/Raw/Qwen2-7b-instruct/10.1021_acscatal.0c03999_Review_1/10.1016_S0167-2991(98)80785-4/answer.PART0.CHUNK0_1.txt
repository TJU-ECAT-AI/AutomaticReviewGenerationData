[1] "The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SIO2."
[2] "Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."
[3] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[4] "The main products of the conversion of C3H8 in the presence of Ar were C3H6 and H2, while those in the presence of CO2 were C3H6, H2, and CO."
[5] "The activity of the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[6] "In the case of Cr203/SiO2 catalyst, the selectivities of CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield."
[7] "The yield of C3H6 reached a maximum of about 21% at the second pulse. After the second pulse, the yield of C3H6 slightly decreased with increasing pulse number."
[8] "This strongly suggests that CO2 could enhance the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst."

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals distinct differences based on the support materials. Among the catalysts tested—supported on alumina (Al2O3), activated carbon (AC), and silica (SiO2)—only silica-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) exhibited promoting effects of CO2. Specifically, the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst demonstrated enhanced yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppression of catalyst deactivation in the presence of CO2. Notably, the activity of the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst was 40% higher in the presence of CO2 compared to its activity in its absence. The selectivities for CO and hydrogen (H2) remained unchanged regardless of the yield of C3H6 on the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Pulse reaction studies further confirmed that the partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on silica is more active for the dehydrogenation of propane than a reduced catalyst. The presence of CO2 appears to enhance the rate of the dehydrogenation of propane over the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, suggesting that this promoting effect occurs at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）方面的活性和选择性比较，基于支持材料表现出明显的差异。在测试的催化剂中——以氧化铝（Al2O3）、活化碳（AC）和硅（SiO2）为支持材料——只有硅支持的铬氧化物（Cr2O3）显示出了二氧化碳的促进效果。特别是，硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下显示出丙烯（C3H6）产率的增加和催化剂失活的抑制。值得注意的是，硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的活性比其在二氧化碳不存在时高出40%。无论丙烯（C3H6）的产率如何，硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂对CO和氢（H2）的选择性保持不变。脉冲反应研究表明，部分氧化的Cr2O3支持在硅上对于丙烷脱氢比还原催化剂更为活跃。二氧化碳似乎能够增强硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂上丙烷的脱氢速率，表明这种促进作用发生在Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的边界处。
