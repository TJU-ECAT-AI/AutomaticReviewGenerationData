The document highlights that the effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 exhibit specifically on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst enhance the yield of C3H6 and suppress catalyst deactivation. Notably, the activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 is 40% higher compared to its activity without CO2. Additionally, CO2 can suppress catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates high activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. During the reaction in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 may remain partially oxidized.

文档指出，二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的影响仅在二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂上表现出来。二氧化碳对Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的促进作用可以提高丙烯的产率并抑制催化剂失活。值得注意的是，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性比无二氧化碳时高40%。此外，二氧化碳可以抑制催化剂的失活。部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂对于丙烷脱氢具有高度活性。在二氧化碳存在的反应中，Cr2O3/SiO2表面可能保持部分氧化状态。

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) reveals distinct differences based on the support materials. Among the catalysts tested—supported on alumina (Al2O3), activated carbon (AC), and silica (SiO2)—only silica-supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) exhibited promoting effects of CO2. Specifically, the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst demonstrated enhanced yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppression of catalyst deactivation in the presence of CO2. Notably, the activity of the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst was 40% higher in the presence of CO2 compared to its activity in its absence. The selectivities for CO and hydrogen (H2) remained unchanged regardless of the yield of C3H6 on the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst. Pulse reaction studies further confirmed that the partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on silica is more active for the dehydrogenation of propane than a reduced catalyst. The presence of CO2 appears to enhance the rate of the dehydrogenation of propane over the silica-supported Cr2O3 catalyst, suggesting that this promoting effect occurs at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）方面的活性和选择性比较，基于支持材料表现出明显的差异。在测试的催化剂中——以氧化铝（Al2O3）、活化碳（AC）和硅（SiO2）为支持材料——只有硅支持的铬氧化物（Cr2O3）显示出了二氧化碳的促进效果。特别是，硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下显示出丙烯（C3H6）产率的增加和催化剂失活的抑制。值得注意的是，硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂在二氧化碳存在下的活性比其在二氧化碳不存在时高出40%。无论丙烯（C3H6）的产率如何，硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂对CO和氢（H2）的选择性保持不变。脉冲反应研究表明，部分氧化的Cr2O3支持在硅上对于丙烷脱氢比还原催化剂更为活跃。二氧化碳似乎能够增强硅支持的Cr2O3催化剂上丙烷的脱氢速率，表明这种促进作用发生在Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的边界处。

1. Among the metal oxide catalysts tested, CO2 only had a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to produce propylene (C3H6) over a Cr203 catalyst supported on SiO2. This catalyst showed enhanced yield of propylene and suppression of catalyst deactivation due to CO2 addition. The partially oxidized state of Cr203 on the SiO2 surface was advantageous for the dehydrogenation reaction, especially in the presence of CO2.

1. The comparison of metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP shows that only SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts exhibit promoting effects of CO2. Specifically, CO2 enhances the yield of C3H6 and suppresses catalyst deactivation. This effect is attributed to the enhanced activity of partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 compared to a reduced catalyst. The key factor influencing the catalytic performance is the interaction between Cr203 and SiO2 particles, particularly at their boundaries where the promoting effects of CO2 occur.

2. The study investigated the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 over Cr203 catalysts supported on different materials, including Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2. Carbon dioxide showed a promoting effect on the SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst, enhancing the yield of C3H6 and delaying catalyst deactivation. The Cr203/SiO2 catalyst exhibited a 40% higher activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. The selectivities for CO and H2 did not vary with changes in C3H6 yield. CO2 significantly improved the yield of C3H6, and the ratio of C3H6 yield in the presence of CO2 to that in its absence decreased with increasing Cr203 content in the catalyst. The surface of Cr203 was found to be partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2, suggesting a protective role against catalyst deactivation.

3. The study on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 using Cr203 catalysts supported on different materials revealed that only SiO2-supported Cr203 catalysts exhibited promoting effects of CO2. These effects included enhancing the yield of C3H6 and suppressing catalyst deactivation. The promoting effect of CO2 on the Cr203/SiO2 catalyst was attributed to the maintenance of a partially oxidized state of the Cr203 surface during the reaction in the presence of CO2, leading to increased activity. The study further suggested that the promoting effects of CO2 occurred at the boundaries between Cr203 and SiO2 particles, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance of the Cr203/SiO2 system.

1. 对于不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳脱氢生产丙烯醇反应中的活性和选择性的比较，只有SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂显示出二氧化碳的促进效果。具体来说，二氧化碳能够提高丙烯醇的产率并抑制催化剂失活。这种效果归因于部分氧化态的Cr203在SiO2上的活性比还原态催化剂更高。影响催化性能的关键因素是Cr203与SiO2颗粒之间的相互作用，特别是它们的边界处，这是二氧化碳促进效果发生的地方。

2. 研究调查了不同材料上支持的Cr203催化剂（如Al2O3、活性炭和SiO2）对C3H8脱氢成C3H6的催化性能。二氧化碳仅在SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂中表现出促进作用，提高了丙烯醇的产率并延缓了催化剂的失活。Cr203/SiO2催化剂在二氧化碳存在的条件下活性比二氧化碳不存在时高40%。对于CO和H2的选择性不随丙烯醇产率的变化而变化。二氧化碳显著提高了丙烯醇的产率，并且在存在二氧化碳的情况下，丙烯醇的产率与二氧化碳不存在时的比例随着Cr203含量的增加而降低。研究发现，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，Cr203表面被部分氧化，这可能起到了保护作用，防止催化剂失活。Cr203/SiO2催化剂表面的这种部分氧化状态被认为是其活性增强的原因。

3. 对于使用不同载体支持的Cr203催化剂进行C3H8脱氢为C3H6的研究揭示了仅SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂显示出二氧化碳的促进效果。这些效果包括提高丙烯醇的产率和抑制催化剂失活。二氧化碳对Cr203/SiO2催化剂的促进作用归因于在二氧化碳存在的条件下保持Cr203表面部分氧化状态，从而提高了活性。研究进一步表明，二氧化碳的促进效果发生在Cr203和SiO2颗粒的边界处，促进了Cr203/SiO2体系的催化性能。

The various metal oxide catalysts compared in the study were Cr2O3 supported on A1203, active carbon, and SiO2. Among these, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts exhibited the most notable promoting effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. The CO2 promoted the yield of propylene and suppressed catalyst deactivation. Specifically, the activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst increased by 40% when CO2 was present, compared to its activity in the absence of CO2. Additionally, the presence of CO2 was found to maintain the surface of Cr2O3 partially oxidized, which contributed to the enhanced catalytic performance. This was also supported by the observation of smaller peaks in the TPR/D profiles of the catalyst treated with CO2, suggesting oxidation of the Cr2O3 surface.

在研究中比较的各种金属氧化物催化剂包括Cr2O3支持在A1203、活性碳和SiO2上。其中，SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯时表现出最显著的CO2促进效果。CO2提高了丙烯的产率，并抑制了催化剂的失活。具体来说，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在的条件下的活性比无CO2条件下提高了40%。此外，发现CO2能够维持Cr2O3表面部分氧化状态，这是增强催化性能的关键因素。这一结论也得到了TPR/D谱图中催化剂处理过CO2后观察到的小峰的证实，这些小峰表明Cr2O3表面的部分氧化。
