The document highlights that the effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 exhibit specifically on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst enhance the yield of C3H6 and suppress catalyst deactivation. Notably, the activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 is 40% higher compared to its activity without CO2. Additionally, CO2 can suppress catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates high activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. During the reaction in the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 may remain partially oxidized.

文档指出，二氧化碳对丙烷脱氢生成丙烯的影响仅在二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂上表现出来。二氧化碳对Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的促进作用可以提高丙烯的产率并抑制催化剂失活。值得注意的是，在二氧化碳存在的条件下，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性比无二氧化碳时高40%。此外，二氧化碳可以抑制催化剂的失活。部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂对于丙烷脱氢具有高度活性。在二氧化碳存在的反应中，Cr2O3/SiO2表面可能保持部分氧化状态。
