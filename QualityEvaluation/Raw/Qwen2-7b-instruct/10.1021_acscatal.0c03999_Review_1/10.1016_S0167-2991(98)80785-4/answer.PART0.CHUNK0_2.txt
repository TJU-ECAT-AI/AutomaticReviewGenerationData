[I] "The effects of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr203 catalysts supported on A1203, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr203 catalyst."
[II] "The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr203/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[III] "The partially oxidized Cr203 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr203/SiO2 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction."

1. Among the metal oxide catalysts tested, CO2 only had a promoting effect on the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) to produce propylene (C3H6) over a Cr203 catalyst supported on SiO2. This catalyst showed enhanced yield of propylene and suppression of catalyst deactivation due to CO2 addition. The partially oxidized state of Cr203 on the SiO2 surface was advantageous for the dehydrogenation reaction, especially in the presence of CO2.

1. 在测试的金属氧化物催化剂中，仅SiO2支持的Cr203催化剂对丙烷（C3H8）脱氢生成丙烯（C3H6）表现出促进作用。在CO2添加下，这种催化剂可以提高丙烯的产率并抑制催化剂失活。Cr203在SiO2表面的半氧化状态对于脱氢反应是有利的，尤其是在CO2存在的条件下。
