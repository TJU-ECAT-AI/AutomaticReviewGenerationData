[1] "The catalyst exhibits a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend as Ru loading increases up to 3 wt%. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst."
[2] "We show that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds."
[3] "When the Ru loading reached 3 wt%, C3H8 conversion was reduced to 4.5% with a selectivity of 39% to C3H6. The production rate ratio of CO to H2 was determined to be 2.76, which suggests that the reforming reaction (eqn (4) and (5)) of C3H8 with CO2 became dominant."
[4] "The XPS results of the samples after 50 min on stream are also shown in Fig. S2 for comparison. All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."
[5] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream. However, the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed the highest C3H8 conversion, C3H6 production rate and C3H6 selectivity the entire time."

The comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals that the addition of small amounts of Ru enhances the activity of the chromium oxide catalyst. Specifically, a catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in propylene production rate compared to the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. The optimal catalyst configuration involves Ru activation that helps shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, increasing activity without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. However, higher Ru loadings result in decreased activity and selectivity due to increased CO2 adsorption and the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. This study demonstrates that the synergy between Ru and Cr catalysts can significantly improve the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. As Ru loading increases, the catalyst shows a volcano-shaped trend in propylene production rate, with the optimal loading being 1 wt% Ru. This loading allows for the removal of adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface, facilitating the direct dehydrogenation reaction. With higher Ru loadings, the catalyst shifts towards a reforming reaction pathway due to the increased adsorption of CO2, affecting both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene.

The stability tests indicate that the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst maintains the highest activity throughout the time-on-stream experiments. This catalyst's ability to resist deactivation, especially when compared to others, underscores its efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation processes involving CO2. The catalyst's stability is crucial for practical applications, ensuring consistent performance over prolonged operation periods.

金属氧化物催化剂对于CO2-ODHP的比较显示，添加少量Ru可以增强铬氧化物催化剂的活性。具体来说，含1 wt% Ru的催化剂在丙烯生成速率上相较于未改性的铬氧化物催化剂提高了两倍。最佳催化剂配置通过Ru激活帮助推动直接脱氢反应的平衡，提高活性同时不破坏碳-碳（CC）键。然而，较高的Ru负载导致活性和选择性下降，这是由于CO2吸附增加以及丙烯和CO2的重整反应加剧。这项研究证明了Ru和Cr催化剂之间的协同作用可以显著改善丙烷与CO2参与的氧化脱氢过程。

支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演化依赖于负载和支撑性质。随着Ru负载的增加，催化剂显示出丙烯生成速率的火山状趋势，最佳负载为1 wt% Ru。这一负载允许去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，促进直接脱氢反应。随着更高负载的Ru，催化剂转向重整反应途径，这是由于CO2吸附增加影响了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性。

稳定性测试表明，Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂在整个时间流中保持最高的活性。该催化剂在抗失活方面的表现尤为突出，尤其是在与其他催化剂比较时。这种稳定性对于实际应用至关重要，确保在长期操作期间保持一致的性能。
