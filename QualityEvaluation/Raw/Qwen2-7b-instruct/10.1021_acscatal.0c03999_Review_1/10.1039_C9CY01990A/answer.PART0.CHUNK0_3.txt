[1] "Propylene (C3H6) is a main petrochemical building block used to produce a wide range of industrial chemicals (e.g.,polypropylene, propylene oxide, cumene, and acrylonitrile),with an annual production rate of 80 million tons."
[2] "The catalyst exhibits a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend as Ru loading increases up to 3 wt%."
[3] "We show that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds."
[4] "The catalyst structure characterization showed that the CrOx species on SiO2 supports have many different species depending on the coverage of Cr."
[5] "All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."
[6] "For Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), top), C3H6 production began at 390 C and H2 production began at the same temperature."
[7] "Clearly, increasing the loading of Ru results in an increase in the amount of C3H8 consumed and the amount of C3H6 produced, which suggests that Ru improves the ability of the catalyst to activate C3H8."

The questions relate to comparing the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), focusing on chromium oxide catalysts modified with different amounts of ruthenium (Ru). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the evolution of chromium species in supported chromium(II) oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Specifically:

1. Chromium oxide catalysts are promising for CO2-ODP due to their high activity in direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes with high selectivity to alkenes. The addition of a small amount of Ru to the conventional SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst enhances its ability to activate CO2, shifting the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, thereby increasing the activity without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds.

2. The structure of Cr species on SiO2 supports varies with Cr loading. At low Cr loadings, Cr species are dispersed and may evolve from grafted Cr6+ to dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and eventually to crystalline α-Cr2O3 as the Cr coverage increases. 

3. After 50 minutes of reaction, the XPS spectra of the catalysts show similar peak positions, suggesting that the electronic state of Ru remains constant regardless of the reaction time.

4. In the absence of CO2, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield remain unchanged, indicating that the DDP reaction is the primary pathway. With CO2 added, the conversion and yield increase, demonstrating the enhanced capability of the catalyst to activate CO2.

5. The TP-MS results indicate that Ru improves the ability of the catalyst to activate C3H8. However, with high Ru loading, the catalyst becomes less selective to C3H6, as evidenced by the increased reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2, leading to a low selectivity to C3H6.

6. The evolution of catalyst activity with Ru loading follows a volcano-shape trend, peaking at 1 wt% Ru. This optimal Ru loading leads to a twofold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared to the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst.

In summary, the introduction of Ru to chromium oxide catalysts can significantly enhance the catalytic performance for CO2-ODP, particularly by improving the activation of CO2 and shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction. However, excessive Ru loading can negatively impact the selectivity to C3H6 due to increased reforming reactions.

问题关注于比较不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳参与的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODP）反应中的性能，特别强调了含不同量钌（Ru）的二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂的性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括二氧化硅支持的铬（II）氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂中铬物种随负载和支撑材料性质变化的演变。

1. 铬氧化物催化剂对于直接脱氢生成低碳烷烃具有高活性，并且具有良好的碳-碳（CC）键保留能力，因此适用于CO2-ODP。添加少量的Ru到常规的二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂中可以增强其CO2激活能力，通过改变直接脱氢反应的平衡，从而提高活性而不破坏CC键。

2. 在二氧化硅支持的催化剂中，随着Cr负载的增加，Cr物种的结构会从分散的Cr6+、分散的Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+氧化物逐渐演化为结晶α-Cr2O3。

3. 反应50分钟后，催化剂的XPS光谱显示相似的峰位置，表明Ru的电子状态在反应时间上保持不变。

4. 在没有CO2的情况下，C3H8转化率和C3H6产率保持不变，说明脱氢反应是主要途径。加入CO2后，转化率和产率增加，证明催化剂激活CO2的能力增强。

5. TP-MS结果表明，Ru可以提高催化剂激活C3H8的能力。然而，随着Ru负载的增加，催化剂对C3H6的选择性降低，因为C3H6与CO2的重整反应增加，导致C3H6选择性降低。

6. Ru负载量与催化剂活性之间的关系呈现火山型趋势，在1wt% Ru时达到峰值。这一最佳Ru负载使得丙烯生产速率相对于未改性的铬氧化物催化剂增加了两倍。

综上所述，向铬氧化物催化剂中引入Ru可以显著增强CO2-ODP反应的催化性能，特别是通过改善CO2激活能力和改变脱氢反应的平衡。然而，过高的Ru负载可能会因C3H6与CO2的重整反应增加而降低C3H6的选择性。
