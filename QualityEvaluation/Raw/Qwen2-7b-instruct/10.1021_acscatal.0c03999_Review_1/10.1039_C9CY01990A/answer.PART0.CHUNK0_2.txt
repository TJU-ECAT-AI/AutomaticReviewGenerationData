[4] "Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2."

The document discusses the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes using CO2 as an alternative process, which is attractive due to its thermodynamic benefits and potential for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The study focuses on a Ru-modified conventional SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP). It reveals that the catalyst's propylene production rate follows a volcano-shaped trend with increasing Ru loading up to 3 wt%, with an optimal catalyst containing 1 wt% Ru exhibiting a twofold enhancement in propylene production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst. The introduction of Ru helps activate CO2 and removes adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface, shifting the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction and improving activity without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. Higher Ru loadings reduce activity and selectivity due to the adsorption of CO2 blocking propane adsorption and the high activity of Ru for reforming reactions involving propylene and CO2. The research demonstrates the modification of conventional chromium catalysts for ODP reactions and its impact on catalytic performance. An optimized catalyst with 1% Ru loading shows a doubled activity compared to the unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst.

该文档讨论了使用CO2作为商业脱氢过程替代方案的烷烃氧化脱氢，其具有更高的热力学极限，并且有助于减少人为CO2排放。研究集中在对常规SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂进行Ru改性，用于丙烷（ODP）的氧化脱氢。结果显示，催化剂的丙烯产率随Ru负载增加呈现出火山状趋势，直到3 wt%，最优催化剂含有1 wt% Ru，其丙烯产率比未改性的催化剂提高了两倍。引入Ru有助于激活CO2并从催化剂表面去除吸附的H2，使直接脱氢反应的平衡发生偏移，从而提高活性而不会断开碳-碳（CC）键。较高的Ru负载导致活性和选择性降低，因为大量的CO2吸附阻断了丙烷吸附，以及Ru对丙烯和CO2重整反应的高活性。研究表明，常规铬基催化剂的ODP反应的修改及其对催化性能的影响。优化后的催化剂含有1%的Ru负载，与未经改性的SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂相比，活性提高了两倍。
