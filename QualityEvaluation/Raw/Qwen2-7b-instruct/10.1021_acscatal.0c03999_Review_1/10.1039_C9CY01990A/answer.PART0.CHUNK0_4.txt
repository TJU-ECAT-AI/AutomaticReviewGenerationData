[1] "The catalyst exhibits a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend as Ru loading increases up to 3 wt%."
[2] "The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst."
[3] "We show that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds."
[4] "Higher loadings of Ru lead to a decrease in activity and selectivity due to the large amount of adsorbed CO2 that blocks propane adsorption, as well as the high activity of Ru for the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2."
[5] "This work demonstrates a new modification of the conventional chromium catalyst for the ODP reaction and its effects on catalytic performance."
[6] "The C3H8 conversion showed a volcano-shaped activity trend with respect to Ru loading, with an optimal loading amount of 1 wt% Ru."
[7] "Small amounts of Ru promote the activation of C3H8 and CO2 and facilitate the equilibrium shift of direct dehydrogenation by removing the adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface through the reverse water-gas shift reaction."
[8] "However, large amounts of Ru lead to a low C3H8 conversion and poor selectivity to C3H6 due to the increased adsorption of CO2 and high activity for the reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxide catalysts, display varying activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the loading amount of the modifying metal (such as Ru), and the properties of the support material. As the loading of Ru increases, the catalyst's activity and selectivity for propylene production initially increase before decreasing due to the blocking of propane adsorption by adsorbed CO2 and the high activity of Ru for reforming reactions.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts, when modified with small amounts of Ru, demonstrate an optimal performance with a loading of 1 wt%. This modification enhances the activation of CO2 and shifts the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, facilitating an increase in propylene production without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. The addition of Ru also aids in removing adsorbed hydrogen (H2) on the catalyst surface through a reverse water-gas shift reaction, thereby improving the catalyst's activity.

3. High loadings of Ru in the catalyst lead to a decrease in both propylene conversion and selectivity. This is due to the increased adsorption of CO2, which blocks propane adsorption, and the high activity of Ru for reforming reactions involving propylene and CO2. As a result, the catalyst becomes less selective and efficient in producing propylene from propane with CO2.

4. The study highlights the importance of Ru-modification in enhancing the catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP. By understanding the relationship between Ru loading, catalyst structure, and catalytic activity, researchers can design more effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes involving lower alkanes and CO2.

1. 不同金属氧化物催化剂，在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性存在差异。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型、修饰金属（如Ru）的负载量以及支持材料的性质。随着Ru负载量的增加，催化剂的活性和丙烯生成率在达到3 wt%之前呈火山形趋势，之后逐渐下降。这主要是由于高量的Ru导致丙烷吸附受阻、CO2吸附过多以及Ru对丙烯和CO2重整反应的高活性所致。

2. 当铬氧化物催化剂通过添加少量Ru进行改性时，显示了1 wt%的最佳负载量，表现出优化的性能。这种修改提高了CO2的活化能力，并通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的氢气，从而促进了直接脱氢反应的平衡转移，进而提高了丙烯生成率而不会断裂碳-碳（CC）键。添加Ru还有助于去除催化剂表面吸附的氢气，改善催化剂的活性。

3. 高量的Ru在催化剂中会导致丙烷转化率和选择性的降低。这是由于过量的CO2吸附阻断了丙烷吸附，以及Ru对丙烯和CO2重整反应的高活性导致的结果。因此，催化剂变得不那么选择性和有效，用于从丙烷和CO2生产丙烯。

4. 研究强调了Ru改性在提高铬基催化剂CO2-ODHP性能方面的重要性。通过理解Ru负载量、催化剂结构与催化活性之间的关系，研究人员可以设计出更有效的催化剂，用于涉及较低烷烃和CO2的氧化脱氢过程。
