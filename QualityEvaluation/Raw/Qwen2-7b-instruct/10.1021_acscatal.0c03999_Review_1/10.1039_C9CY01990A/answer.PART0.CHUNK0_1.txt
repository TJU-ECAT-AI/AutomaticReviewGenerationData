[1] "To develop an efficient catalyst for the ODP reaction with CO2, the key challenge is finding a suitable catalyst that can activate CO2 with high activity and cleave the CH bonds of C3H8 without breaking CC bonds."
[2] "The results show that the catalytic behaviour of these catalysts is highly sensitive to the Ru loading. The catalytic activity of the optimized catalyst (1% Ru loading) is double that of unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide."
[3] "The XRD patterns of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction are similar, as shown in Fig. 2(a)."
[4] "The XPS results of the samples after 50 min on stream are also shown in Fig. S2 for comparison."
[5] "Clearly, increasing the loading of Ru results in an increase in the amount of C3H8 consumed and the amount of C3H6 produced, which suggests that Ru improves the ability of the catalyst to activate C3H8."
[6] "For Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), top), C3H6 production began at 390 C and H2 production began at the same temperature."
[7] "For Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 (Fig. 3(a), bottom), the amount of C3H6 produced was much smaller than with Cr10Ox/SiO2 and Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2, and there was a large amount of H2O and H2 produced starting around 360 C, indicating that another reaction pathway (reforming reaction,eqn (4) and (5)) happened over this catalyst with a low selectivity to C3H6."

The literature discusses how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP (Catalytic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with CO2). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the specific metal loading, and the properties of the support material. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to the loading amount and the support characteristics. The text highlights the role of ruthenium (Ru) in modifying the catalysts, particularly in enhancing CO2 activation and shifting the equilibrium towards the desired oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. The text also mentions that the addition of Ru can lead to increased CO2 adsorption, which might hinder propane adsorption and selectivity, especially at higher Ru loadings.

In terms of specific details:
1. The key challenge in developing a catalyst for CO2-ODHP involves finding a catalyst that can efficiently activate CO2 with high activity while maintaining the integrity of the carbon-carbon (CC) bonds during the dehydrogenation of propane.
2. The optimized catalyst with 1% Ru loading exhibits double the catalytic activity compared to an unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst.
3. The XRD patterns of the catalysts after 50 minutes of reaction display similarities, with broad peaks attributed to amorphous silica gel and weak diffraction peaks indexed to α-Cr2O3.
4. XPS results after 50 minutes of reaction show that Ru species are partially oxidized, and the Cr 2p XPS spectra demonstrate the coexistence of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions.
5. Increasing Ru loading leads to an increase in the consumption of propane and the production of propylene, indicating that Ru enhances the catalyst's ability to activate propane.
6. The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst shows a preference for direct dehydrogenation, with C3H6 production beginning at 390°C and H2 production at the same temperature.
7. The Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst, with higher Ru loading, shows a reduced selectivity for propylene production, with a larger amount of H2 and H2O produced starting around 360°C, suggesting the occurrence of a reforming reaction pathway with low selectivity for propylene.

文献讨论了用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢）的不同金属氧化物催化剂在活性和选择性方面的比较。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型、特定的金属负载量以及支持材料的特性。在支持Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种的演变与加载量和支撑材料特性紧密相关。文献强调了钌（Ru）对催化剂的修改作用，特别是增强CO2活化并推动期望的氧化脱氢路径的能力。文献还提到，增加Ru的添加可以导致更高的CO2吸附，这可能阻碍丙烷吸附和选择性，尤其是在较高Ru负载时。

具体细节如下：
1. 在开发CO2-ODHP催化剂时的关键挑战是找到一种既能高效激活CO2又能保持碳-碳（CC）键完整性的催化剂。
2. 添加1% Ru负载的优化催化剂的催化活性比未改性的SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂高一倍。
3. 催化剂反应50分钟后，其XRD图案显示出相似性，宽峰归因于非晶态二氧化硅凝胶，弱衍射峰被归类为α-Cr2O3。
4. 反应50分钟后，Ru元素的XPS结果表明Ru物种部分氧化，Cr 2p XPS谱图显示存在Cr2+和Cr3+离子共存。
5. 随着Ru负载量的增加，丙烷消耗量和丙烯产量均增加，表明Ru增强了催化剂激活丙烷的能力。
6. Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂倾向于直接脱氢，C3H6生成开始于390°C，H2生成在同一温度。
7. Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂，具有更高Ru负载，显示出较低的丙烯选择性生产，从大约360°C开始产生大量的H2和H2O，这表明发生了低选择性丙烯生成的重整反应途径。
