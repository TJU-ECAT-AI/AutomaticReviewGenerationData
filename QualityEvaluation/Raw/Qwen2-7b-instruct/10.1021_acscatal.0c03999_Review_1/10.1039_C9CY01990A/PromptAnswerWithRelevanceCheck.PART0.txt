[1] "The catalyst exhibits a volcano-shape propylene production rate trend as Ru loading increases up to 3 wt%. The optimal catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared with the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst."
[2] "We show that a small amount of Ru could help activate CO2 and remove adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface to shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, resulting in an increase in its activity without breaking the CC bonds."
[3] "When the Ru loading reached 3 wt%, C3H8 conversion was reduced to 4.5% with a selectivity of 39% to C3H6. The production rate ratio of CO to H2 was determined to be 2.76, which suggests that the reforming reaction (eqn (4) and (5)) of C3H8 with CO2 became dominant."
[4] "The XPS results of the samples after 50 min on stream are also shown in Fig. S2 for comparison. All the Cr 2p XPS spectra (Fig. S2(a)) of the three catalysts after 50 min of reaction exhibit similar peak positions as the samples after 5 min of reaction."
[5] "The stability of the catalysts was also tested in this work. As shown in Fig. 6, all catalysts gradually deactivated with time on stream. However, the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst showed the highest C3H8 conversion, C3H6 production rate and C3H6 selectivity the entire time."

The comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals that the addition of small amounts of Ru enhances the activity of the chromium oxide catalyst. Specifically, a catalyst with 1 wt% Ru showed a two-fold enhancement in propylene production rate compared to the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst. The optimal catalyst configuration involves Ru activation that helps shift the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, increasing activity without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. However, higher Ru loadings result in decreased activity and selectivity due to increased CO2 adsorption and the reforming reaction of propylene and CO2. This study demonstrates that the synergy between Ru and Cr catalysts can significantly improve the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. As Ru loading increases, the catalyst shows a volcano-shaped trend in propylene production rate, with the optimal loading being 1 wt% Ru. This loading allows for the removal of adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface, facilitating the direct dehydrogenation reaction. With higher Ru loadings, the catalyst shifts towards a reforming reaction pathway due to the increased adsorption of CO2, affecting both the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propylene.

The stability tests indicate that the Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst maintains the highest activity throughout the time-on-stream experiments. This catalyst's ability to resist deactivation, especially when compared to others, underscores its efficiency in oxidative dehydrogenation processes involving CO2. The catalyst's stability is crucial for practical applications, ensuring consistent performance over prolonged operation periods.

金属氧化物催化剂对于CO2-ODHP的比较显示，添加少量Ru可以增强铬氧化物催化剂的活性。具体来说，含1 wt% Ru的催化剂在丙烯生成速率上相较于未改性的铬氧化物催化剂提高了两倍。最佳催化剂配置通过Ru激活帮助推动直接脱氢反应的平衡，提高活性同时不破坏碳-碳（CC）键。然而，较高的Ru负载导致活性和选择性下降，这是由于CO2吸附增加以及丙烯和CO2的重整反应加剧。这项研究证明了Ru和Cr催化剂之间的协同作用可以显著改善丙烷与CO2参与的氧化脱氢过程。

支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演化依赖于负载和支撑性质。随着Ru负载的增加，催化剂显示出丙烯生成速率的火山状趋势，最佳负载为1 wt% Ru。这一负载允许去除催化剂表面吸附的H2，促进直接脱氢反应。随着更高负载的Ru，催化剂转向重整反应途径，这是由于CO2吸附增加影响了丙烷的转化率和丙烯的选择性。

稳定性测试表明，Ru1Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂在整个时间流中保持最高的活性。该催化剂在抗失活方面的表现尤为突出，尤其是在与其他催化剂比较时。这种稳定性对于实际应用至关重要，确保在长期操作期间保持一致的性能。

The literature discusses how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP (Catalytic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with CO2). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the specific metal loading, and the properties of the support material. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is closely tied to the loading amount and the support characteristics. The text highlights the role of ruthenium (Ru) in modifying the catalysts, particularly in enhancing CO2 activation and shifting the equilibrium towards the desired oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. The text also mentions that the addition of Ru can lead to increased CO2 adsorption, which might hinder propane adsorption and selectivity, especially at higher Ru loadings.

In terms of specific details:
1. The key challenge in developing a catalyst for CO2-ODHP involves finding a catalyst that can efficiently activate CO2 with high activity while maintaining the integrity of the carbon-carbon (CC) bonds during the dehydrogenation of propane.
2. The optimized catalyst with 1% Ru loading exhibits double the catalytic activity compared to an unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst.
3. The XRD patterns of the catalysts after 50 minutes of reaction display similarities, with broad peaks attributed to amorphous silica gel and weak diffraction peaks indexed to α-Cr2O3.
4. XPS results after 50 minutes of reaction show that Ru species are partially oxidized, and the Cr 2p XPS spectra demonstrate the coexistence of Cr2+ and Cr3+ ions.
5. Increasing Ru loading leads to an increase in the consumption of propane and the production of propylene, indicating that Ru enhances the catalyst's ability to activate propane.
6. The Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst shows a preference for direct dehydrogenation, with C3H6 production beginning at 390°C and H2 production at the same temperature.
7. The Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst, with higher Ru loading, shows a reduced selectivity for propylene production, with a larger amount of H2 and H2O produced starting around 360°C, suggesting the occurrence of a reforming reaction pathway with low selectivity for propylene.

文献讨论了用于CO2-ODHP（丙烷与CO2的氧化脱氢）的不同金属氧化物催化剂在活性和选择性方面的比较。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型、特定的金属负载量以及支持材料的特性。在支持Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种的演变与加载量和支撑材料特性紧密相关。文献强调了钌（Ru）对催化剂的修改作用，特别是增强CO2活化并推动期望的氧化脱氢路径的能力。文献还提到，增加Ru的添加可以导致更高的CO2吸附，这可能阻碍丙烷吸附和选择性，尤其是在较高Ru负载时。

具体细节如下：
1. 在开发CO2-ODHP催化剂时的关键挑战是找到一种既能高效激活CO2又能保持碳-碳（CC）键完整性的催化剂。
2. 添加1% Ru负载的优化催化剂的催化活性比未改性的SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂高一倍。
3. 催化剂反应50分钟后，其XRD图案显示出相似性，宽峰归因于非晶态二氧化硅凝胶，弱衍射峰被归类为α-Cr2O3。
4. 反应50分钟后，Ru元素的XPS结果表明Ru物种部分氧化，Cr 2p XPS谱图显示存在Cr2+和Cr3+离子共存。
5. 随着Ru负载量的增加，丙烷消耗量和丙烯产量均增加，表明Ru增强了催化剂激活丙烷的能力。
6. Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂倾向于直接脱氢，C3H6生成开始于390°C，H2生成在同一温度。
7. Ru3Cr10Ox/SiO2催化剂，具有更高Ru负载，显示出较低的丙烯选择性生产，从大约360°C开始产生大量的H2和H2O，这表明发生了低选择性丙烯生成的重整反应途径。

The document discusses the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes using CO2 as an alternative process, which is attractive due to its thermodynamic benefits and potential for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The study focuses on a Ru-modified conventional SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP). It reveals that the catalyst's propylene production rate follows a volcano-shaped trend with increasing Ru loading up to 3 wt%, with an optimal catalyst containing 1 wt% Ru exhibiting a twofold enhancement in propylene production rate compared to the unmodified catalyst. The introduction of Ru helps activate CO2 and removes adsorbed H2 on the catalyst surface, shifting the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction and improving activity without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. Higher Ru loadings reduce activity and selectivity due to the adsorption of CO2 blocking propane adsorption and the high activity of Ru for reforming reactions involving propylene and CO2. The research demonstrates the modification of conventional chromium catalysts for ODP reactions and its impact on catalytic performance. An optimized catalyst with 1% Ru loading shows a doubled activity compared to the unmodified SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst.

该文档讨论了使用CO2作为商业脱氢过程替代方案的烷烃氧化脱氢，其具有更高的热力学极限，并且有助于减少人为CO2排放。研究集中在对常规SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂进行Ru改性，用于丙烷（ODP）的氧化脱氢。结果显示，催化剂的丙烯产率随Ru负载增加呈现出火山状趋势，直到3 wt%，最优催化剂含有1 wt% Ru，其丙烯产率比未改性的催化剂提高了两倍。引入Ru有助于激活CO2并从催化剂表面去除吸附的H2，使直接脱氢反应的平衡发生偏移，从而提高活性而不会断开碳-碳（CC）键。较高的Ru负载导致活性和选择性降低，因为大量的CO2吸附阻断了丙烷吸附，以及Ru对丙烯和CO2重整反应的高活性。研究表明，常规铬基催化剂的ODP反应的修改及其对催化性能的影响。优化后的催化剂含有1%的Ru负载，与未经改性的SiO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂相比，活性提高了两倍。

The questions relate to comparing the catalytic performance of various metal oxide catalysts in CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), focusing on chromium oxide catalysts modified with different amounts of ruthenium (Ru). The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the evolution of chromium species in supported chromium(II) oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. Specifically:

1. Chromium oxide catalysts are promising for CO2-ODP due to their high activity in direct dehydrogenation of lower alkanes with high selectivity to alkenes. The addition of a small amount of Ru to the conventional SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst enhances its ability to activate CO2, shifting the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, thereby increasing the activity without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds.

2. The structure of Cr species on SiO2 supports varies with Cr loading. At low Cr loadings, Cr species are dispersed and may evolve from grafted Cr6+ to dispersed Cr6+ oxide, microcrystalline Cr3+ oxide, and eventually to crystalline α-Cr2O3 as the Cr coverage increases. 

3. After 50 minutes of reaction, the XPS spectra of the catalysts show similar peak positions, suggesting that the electronic state of Ru remains constant regardless of the reaction time.

4. In the absence of CO2, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield remain unchanged, indicating that the DDP reaction is the primary pathway. With CO2 added, the conversion and yield increase, demonstrating the enhanced capability of the catalyst to activate CO2.

5. The TP-MS results indicate that Ru improves the ability of the catalyst to activate C3H8. However, with high Ru loading, the catalyst becomes less selective to C3H6, as evidenced by the increased reforming reaction of C3H6 and CO2, leading to a low selectivity to C3H6.

6. The evolution of catalyst activity with Ru loading follows a volcano-shape trend, peaking at 1 wt% Ru. This optimal Ru loading leads to a twofold enhancement in the propylene production rate compared to the unmodified chromium oxide catalyst.

In summary, the introduction of Ru to chromium oxide catalysts can significantly enhance the catalytic performance for CO2-ODP, particularly by improving the activation of CO2 and shifting the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction. However, excessive Ru loading can negatively impact the selectivity to C3H6 due to increased reforming reactions.

问题关注于比较不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳参与的丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODP）反应中的性能，特别强调了含不同量钌（Ru）的二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂的性能。影响催化性能的关键因素包括二氧化硅支持的铬（II）氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂中铬物种随负载和支撑材料性质变化的演变。

1. 铬氧化物催化剂对于直接脱氢生成低碳烷烃具有高活性，并且具有良好的碳-碳（CC）键保留能力，因此适用于CO2-ODP。添加少量的Ru到常规的二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂中可以增强其CO2激活能力，通过改变直接脱氢反应的平衡，从而提高活性而不破坏CC键。

2. 在二氧化硅支持的催化剂中，随着Cr负载的增加，Cr物种的结构会从分散的Cr6+、分散的Cr6+氧化物、微晶Cr3+氧化物逐渐演化为结晶α-Cr2O3。

3. 反应50分钟后，催化剂的XPS光谱显示相似的峰位置，表明Ru的电子状态在反应时间上保持不变。

4. 在没有CO2的情况下，C3H8转化率和C3H6产率保持不变，说明脱氢反应是主要途径。加入CO2后，转化率和产率增加，证明催化剂激活CO2的能力增强。

5. TP-MS结果表明，Ru可以提高催化剂激活C3H8的能力。然而，随着Ru负载的增加，催化剂对C3H6的选择性降低，因为C3H6与CO2的重整反应增加，导致C3H6选择性降低。

6. Ru负载量与催化剂活性之间的关系呈现火山型趋势，在1wt% Ru时达到峰值。这一最佳Ru负载使得丙烯生产速率相对于未改性的铬氧化物催化剂增加了两倍。

综上所述，向铬氧化物催化剂中引入Ru可以显著增强CO2-ODP反应的催化性能，特别是通过改善CO2激活能力和改变脱氢反应的平衡。然而，过高的Ru负载可能会因C3H6与CO2的重整反应增加而降低C3H6的选择性。

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxide catalysts, display varying activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the type of metal oxide, the loading amount of the modifying metal (such as Ru), and the properties of the support material. As the loading of Ru increases, the catalyst's activity and selectivity for propylene production initially increase before decreasing due to the blocking of propane adsorption by adsorbed CO2 and the high activity of Ru for reforming reactions.

2. Chromium oxide catalysts, when modified with small amounts of Ru, demonstrate an optimal performance with a loading of 1 wt%. This modification enhances the activation of CO2 and shifts the equilibrium of the direct dehydrogenation reaction, facilitating an increase in propylene production without breaking carbon-carbon (CC) bonds. The addition of Ru also aids in removing adsorbed hydrogen (H2) on the catalyst surface through a reverse water-gas shift reaction, thereby improving the catalyst's activity.

3. High loadings of Ru in the catalyst lead to a decrease in both propylene conversion and selectivity. This is due to the increased adsorption of CO2, which blocks propane adsorption, and the high activity of Ru for reforming reactions involving propylene and CO2. As a result, the catalyst becomes less selective and efficient in producing propylene from propane with CO2.

4. The study highlights the importance of Ru-modification in enhancing the catalytic performance of chromium-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP. By understanding the relationship between Ru loading, catalyst structure, and catalytic activity, researchers can design more effective catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation processes involving lower alkanes and CO2.

1. 不同金属氧化物催化剂，在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性存在差异。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的类型、修饰金属（如Ru）的负载量以及支持材料的性质。随着Ru负载量的增加，催化剂的活性和丙烯生成率在达到3 wt%之前呈火山形趋势，之后逐渐下降。这主要是由于高量的Ru导致丙烷吸附受阻、CO2吸附过多以及Ru对丙烯和CO2重整反应的高活性所致。

2. 当铬氧化物催化剂通过添加少量Ru进行改性时，显示了1 wt%的最佳负载量，表现出优化的性能。这种修改提高了CO2的活化能力，并通过逆水煤气变换反应去除催化剂表面吸附的氢气，从而促进了直接脱氢反应的平衡转移，进而提高了丙烯生成率而不会断裂碳-碳（CC）键。添加Ru还有助于去除催化剂表面吸附的氢气，改善催化剂的活性。

3. 高量的Ru在催化剂中会导致丙烷转化率和选择性的降低。这是由于过量的CO2吸附阻断了丙烷吸附，以及Ru对丙烯和CO2重整反应的高活性导致的结果。因此，催化剂变得不那么选择性和有效，用于从丙烷和CO2生产丙烯。

4. 研究强调了Ru改性在提高铬基催化剂CO2-ODHP性能方面的重要性。通过理解Ru负载量、催化剂结构与催化活性之间的关系，研究人员可以设计出更有效的催化剂，用于涉及较低烷烃和CO2的氧化脱氢过程。
