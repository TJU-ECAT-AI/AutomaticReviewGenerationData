[1] "The catalytic reaction was studied in a flow apparatus at 773923 K. All the tested catalysts exhibited a good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
[2] "Moreover, in the latter cases not all Cr atoms are accessible to reactants, what has also negative effect on the catalytic activity."
[3] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."
[4] "On the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate."
[5] "Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases."
[6] "We observed a similar correlation in this study. However, the effect of the Cr loading on the YCO2=YHe ratio was less significant than that observed over the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst."
[7] "It has been proposed that this alternative propene formation pathway is the main reason of the higher propene yield observed in the presence of CO2."
[8] "Our previous study has revealed that over the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts the higher yield of propene could be also caused by simultaneous consumption of hydrogen (formed in the dehydrogenation) in the RWGS reaction."
[9] "It should therefore be concluded that the dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

1. The catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr showed the best performance in dehydrogenating propane with CO2, achieving a selectivity to propene greater than 80% and converting propane from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. A high level of chromium dispersion is crucial for the catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation, especially in the presence of CO2. As the chromium content increases, the dispersion decreases, negatively impacting the activity. At low chromium contents, Cr6+ species dominate, while above 6.8 wt%, the number of Cr6+ species increases, mirroring the catalytic activity. The effect of chromium loading on the yield ratio of propene in CO2 compared to an inert gas atmosphere was less pronounced than over silica-supported catalysts. The primary reason for the higher propene yield in the presence of CO2 is attributed to a pathway combining direct oxidative dehydrogenation and the RWGS reaction, with the dispersed chromium species being the main contributors to this high yield.

2. The results indicate that the chromium loading significantly affects the catalytic performance of the Cr2O3 catalysts. The catalyst with 6.8 wt% of chromium provided the best performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a selectivity to propene greater than 80%. The conversion of propane increased from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The presence of chromium species in the form of Cr6+ and Cr2+ is essential for the catalytic activity, with the number of Cr6+ species increasing as the chromium content increases, leading to a higher yield of propene. The effect of chromium loading on the yield ratio of propene in CO2 compared to an inert gas atmosphere was less significant than over silica-supported catalysts. The dispersed chromium species are primarily responsible for the high yield of propene in the presence of CO2.

1. 含有6.8 wt%的Cr的催化剂在丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中表现出最佳性能，丙烯选择性超过80%，丙烷转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。铬的分布是关键因素，在丙烷脱氢过程中，尤其是在存在CO2的情况下。随着铬含量的增加，分布减少，对活性产生负面影响。在低铬含量下，Cr6+物种占主导地位，而高于6.8 wt%，Cr6+物种的数量增加，与催化活性相匹配。与二氧化硅支持的催化剂相比，铬加载量对CO2气氛中丙烯产率与惰性气体气氛之间的比率的影响要小得多。在CO2存在的条件下观察到更高的丙烯产率的主要原因是结合直接氧化脱氢和水煤气变换反应途径，分散的铬物种主要负责这种高产率。

2. 结果表明，铬加载量显著影响Cr2O3催化剂的催化性能。含6.8 wt%的铬的催化剂在丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中提供了最佳性能，丙烯选择性超过80%，丙烷转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。Cr6+和Cr2+形式的铬物种对于催化活性至关重要，随着铬含量的增加，Cr6+物种的数量增加，导致丙烯产率更高。与二氧化硅支持的催化剂相比，铬加载量对CO2气氛中丙烯产率与惰性气体气氛之间的比率的影响要小得多。分散的铬物种主要负责在存在CO2时的高丙烯产率。

1. The dispersion of chromium species plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. At high chromium loadings, not all chromium atoms are accessible to reactants, negatively impacting catalytic activity. Mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies on the catalyst surface are particularly active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

2. Chromium(III) species, including Cr3+, are precursors for active chromium species with lower oxidation states, such as Cr2+ and Cr3+. These active species are formed from dispersed chromium(III) species present on the support surface.

3. The presence of chromium(III) species on the surface of the MCM-41 support contributes significantly to the high catalytic activity of chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction. This high activity is an additional factor that explains the observed higher yield of propene.

4. The coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the RWGS reaction is a key mechanism for the observed enhancement of propene yield in the presence of CO2. This synergy allows for more efficient use of CO2 in the production of propene, contributing to the catalyst's overall performance.

1. 铬物种的分散对于CO2-ODHP中的铬氧化物催化剂的催化活性至关重要。在高铬负载下，不是所有铬原子对反应物可及，这会负面影响催化活性。表面具有两个配位空位的单核Cr3+物种在轻烷烃脱氢反应中特别活跃。

2. 包括Cr3+在内的铬（III）物种是形成活性铬物种（如Cr2+和Cr3+）的前体。这些活性物种是在支持表面上分散的铬（III）物种形成的。

3. MCM-41支持下的铬氧化物催化剂在RWGS反应中的高度活性是其产生更高丙烯产量的另一个关键因素。这种高活性是解释观察到的丙烯产量增加的额外原因。

4. 丙烷脱氢与RWGS反应的耦合是观察到在CO2存在下丙烯产率提高的关键机制。这种协同作用允许更有效地利用CO2来生产丙烯，从而提高了催化剂的整体性能。

1. Various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide catalysts showing high catalytic activity in both dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions due to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the dispersion of chromium species and the type of support material. As the chromium loading increases, the catalytic activity generally increases until a certain point, beyond which the activity may decrease due to pore blockage or formation of less active crystalline chromium oxide.

2. Chromium species evolve in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. At lower loadings, Cr6+ species are predominant, serving as precursors for lower oxidation state active Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) on the surface. As the chromium loading increases, the dispersion of these active species may decrease, leading to a formation of less active, crystalline a-Cr2O3. This affects the catalytic performance, with higher activity observed at lower chromium loadings.

3. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in the presence of CO2 over MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is multifaceted. It involves not only the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehydrogenation) but also the facilitation of simple dehydrogenation through coupling with the RWGS reaction. The RWGS reaction proceeds via a surface redox mechanism or Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, depending on the catalyst.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性存在差异，其中铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应和RWGS反应中均表现出高催化活性，这主要归因于表面分散的铬物种的存在。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括物种的分散性和支撑材料的类型。随着铬负载量的增加，催化活性通常会增加，直到某个点之后，活性可能会由于孔隙堵塞或形成较不活跃的结晶铬氧化物而降低。

2. 在支持的Cr2O3催化剂中，随着负载量和支撑材料性质的变化，铬物种会演化。在较低负载下，Cr6+物种占主导地位，并作为表面较低氧化状态活性Cr物种（Cr2+/Cr3+）的前体。随着铬负载量的增加，活性物种的分散度可能下降，导致形成较不活跃的结晶铬氧化物。这影响催化性能，在较低铬负载时观察到更高的活性。

3. CO2在MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂上对丙烯产率的促进作用是多方面的。它不仅涉及丙烷的直接氧化（氧化脱氢），也涉及到通过与RWGS反应的耦合来促进简单的脱氢。RWGS反应可能通过表面还原机制或Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制进行，具体取决于催化剂。

The document discusses the comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted olefin dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP), focusing on chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on MCM-41. Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the dispersion of chromium species, the support type, and the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst. As the chromium loading increases, the catalyst activity generally improves until reaching a saturation point where it decreases due to the formation of less active, crystalline chromium(II) oxide. Dispersion of chromium species is crucial for maximizing activity in both the dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions. Chromium(III) species, particularly those with two coordinative vacancies, are highlighted as being particularly active in light alkane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 enhances propene yield through multiple pathways, including direct oxidation and coupling with the RWGS reaction. The document emphasizes the importance of the dispersion of chromium species and the support properties in achieving high catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP.

The high catalytic activity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction contributes to the observed higher yield of propene. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert CO2 and hydrogen to water and carbon monoxide, respectively, facilitates the propene formation pathway. The dispersion of chromium species on the MCM-41 support plays a pivotal role in enhancing the catalyst's activity for both the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions, thereby contributing to the overall high yield of propene in the presence of CO2.

In summary, the key factors influencing the catalytic performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP include the dispersion of chromium species, the support type, and the interplay between CO2 and the catalyst in facilitating the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions. These factors collectively contribute to the high activity and selectivity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP.
