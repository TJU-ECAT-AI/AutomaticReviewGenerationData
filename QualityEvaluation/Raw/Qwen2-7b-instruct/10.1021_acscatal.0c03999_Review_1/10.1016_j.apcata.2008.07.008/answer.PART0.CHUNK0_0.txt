[1] "The catalytic reaction was studied in a flow apparatus at 773923 K. All the tested catalysts exhibited a good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K)."
[2] "Moreover, in the latter cases not all Cr atoms are accessible to reactants, what has also negative effect on the catalytic activity."
[3] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."
[4] "On the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate."
[5] "Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases."
[6] "We observed a similar correlation in this study. However, the effect of the Cr loading on the YCO2=YHe ratio was less significant than that observed over the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst."
[7] "It has been proposed that this alternative propene formation pathway is the main reason of the higher propene yield observed in the presence of CO2."
[8] "Our previous study has revealed that over the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts the higher yield of propene could be also caused by simultaneous consumption of hydrogen (formed in the dehydrogenation) in the RWGS reaction."
[9] "It should therefore be concluded that the dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

1. The catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr showed the best performance in dehydrogenating propane with CO2, achieving a selectivity to propene greater than 80% and converting propane from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. A high level of chromium dispersion is crucial for the catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation, especially in the presence of CO2. As the chromium content increases, the dispersion decreases, negatively impacting the activity. At low chromium contents, Cr6+ species dominate, while above 6.8 wt%, the number of Cr6+ species increases, mirroring the catalytic activity. The effect of chromium loading on the yield ratio of propene in CO2 compared to an inert gas atmosphere was less pronounced than over silica-supported catalysts. The primary reason for the higher propene yield in the presence of CO2 is attributed to a pathway combining direct oxidative dehydrogenation and the RWGS reaction, with the dispersed chromium species being the main contributors to this high yield.

2. The results indicate that the chromium loading significantly affects the catalytic performance of the Cr2O3 catalysts. The catalyst with 6.8 wt% of chromium provided the best performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, achieving a selectivity to propene greater than 80%. The conversion of propane increased from 21% at 773 K to 62% at 923 K. The presence of chromium species in the form of Cr6+ and Cr2+ is essential for the catalytic activity, with the number of Cr6+ species increasing as the chromium content increases, leading to a higher yield of propene. The effect of chromium loading on the yield ratio of propene in CO2 compared to an inert gas atmosphere was less significant than over silica-supported catalysts. The dispersed chromium species are primarily responsible for the high yield of propene in the presence of CO2.

1. 含有6.8 wt%的Cr的催化剂在丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中表现出最佳性能，丙烯选择性超过80%，丙烷转化率从773 K时的21%增加到923 K时的62%。铬的分布是关键因素，在丙烷脱氢过程中，尤其是在存在CO2的情况下。随着铬含量的增加，分布减少，对活性产生负面影响。在低铬含量下，Cr6+物种占主导地位，而高于6.8 wt%，Cr6+物种的数量增加，与催化活性相匹配。与二氧化硅支持的催化剂相比，铬加载量对CO2气氛中丙烯产率与惰性气体气氛之间的比率的影响要小得多。在CO2存在的条件下观察到更高的丙烯产率的主要原因是结合直接氧化脱氢和水煤气变换反应途径，分散的铬物种主要负责这种高产率。
