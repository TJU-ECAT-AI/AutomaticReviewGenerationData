[1] "The significance of the latter processes has gradually increased due to an imbalance between propene and ethylene production growth rate (both produced as co-products) resulting in a gap in a propene supply."
[2] "It has been shown that CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways."

The document discusses the comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted olefin dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP), focusing on chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on MCM-41. Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the dispersion of chromium species, the support type, and the interaction between CO2 and the catalyst. As the chromium loading increases, the catalyst activity generally improves until reaching a saturation point where it decreases due to the formation of less active, crystalline chromium(II) oxide. Dispersion of chromium species is crucial for maximizing activity in both the dehydrogenation and reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions. Chromium(III) species, particularly those with two coordinative vacancies, are highlighted as being particularly active in light alkane dehydrogenation. The presence of CO2 enhances propene yield through multiple pathways, including direct oxidation and coupling with the RWGS reaction. The document emphasizes the importance of the dispersion of chromium species and the support properties in achieving high catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP.

The high catalytic activity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction contributes to the observed higher yield of propene. The catalysts' ability to efficiently convert CO2 and hydrogen to water and carbon monoxide, respectively, facilitates the propene formation pathway. The dispersion of chromium species on the MCM-41 support plays a pivotal role in enhancing the catalyst's activity for both the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions, thereby contributing to the overall high yield of propene in the presence of CO2.

In summary, the key factors influencing the catalytic performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts for CO2-ODHP include the dispersion of chromium species, the support type, and the interplay between CO2 and the catalyst in facilitating the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions. These factors collectively contribute to the high activity and selectivity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP.

文档讨论了不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳辅助烯烃脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中的比较，重点是支持在MCM-41上的铬氧化物基催化剂。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的分散、支持类型和CO2与催化剂的相互作用。随着铬负载量的增加，催化剂活性通常会提高，直到达到饱和点，之后由于形成较不活跃的二价铬氧化物而降低。铬物种的分散对于在脱氢和反水煤气变换（RWGS）反应中都实现高活性至关重要。特别指出的是，三价铬物种，特别是具有两个配位空位的物种，在轻烷烃脱氢中表现出高度活性。CO2通过多个途径增强丙烯产率，包括直接氧化和与催化剂结合促进的RWGS反应。文档强调了铬物种分散和支持性质在实现CO2-ODHP高活性中的重要性。

MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在RWGS反应中的高催化活性有助于观察到更高的丙烯产率。催化剂能够有效地将CO2和氢气转化为水和一氧化碳，这促进了丙烯形成路径。MCM-41支持上铬物种的分散在增强催化剂的活性方面起着至关重要的作用，对于脱氢和RWGS反应都如此，从而共同贡献于在存在CO2时的高丙烯产率。

综上所述，影响铬氧化物基催化剂在CO2-ODHP中催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的分散、支持类型以及CO2与催化剂之间的相互作用，促进脱氢和RWGS反应。这些因素共同决定了MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的高活性和选择性。
