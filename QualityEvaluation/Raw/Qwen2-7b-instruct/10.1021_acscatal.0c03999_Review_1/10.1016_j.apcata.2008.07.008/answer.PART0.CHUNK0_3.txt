1. Various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, with chromium oxide catalysts showing high catalytic activity in both dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions due to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the dispersion of chromium species and the type of support material. As the chromium loading increases, the catalytic activity generally increases until a certain point, beyond which the activity may decrease due to pore blockage or formation of less active crystalline chromium oxide.

2. Chromium species evolve in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. At lower loadings, Cr6+ species are predominant, serving as precursors for lower oxidation state active Cr species (Cr2+/Cr3+) on the surface. As the chromium loading increases, the dispersion of these active species may decrease, leading to a formation of less active, crystalline a-Cr2O3. This affects the catalytic performance, with higher activity observed at lower chromium loadings.

3. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene in the presence of CO2 over MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is multifaceted. It involves not only the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehydrogenation) but also the facilitation of simple dehydrogenation through coupling with the RWGS reaction. The RWGS reaction proceeds via a surface redox mechanism or Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, depending on the catalyst.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性存在差异，其中铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢反应和RWGS反应中均表现出高催化活性，这主要归因于表面分散的铬物种的存在。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括物种的分散性和支撑材料的类型。随着铬负载量的增加，催化活性通常会增加，直到某个点之后，活性可能会由于孔隙堵塞或形成较不活跃的结晶铬氧化物而降低。

2. 在支持的Cr2O3催化剂中，随着负载量和支撑材料性质的变化，铬物种会演化。在较低负载下，Cr6+物种占主导地位，并作为表面较低氧化状态活性Cr物种（Cr2+/Cr3+）的前体。随着铬负载量的增加，活性物种的分散度可能下降，导致形成较不活跃的结晶铬氧化物。这影响催化性能，在较低铬负载时观察到更高的活性。

3. CO2在MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂上对丙烯产率的促进作用是多方面的。它不仅涉及丙烷的直接氧化（氧化脱氢），也涉及到通过与RWGS反应的耦合来促进简单的脱氢。RWGS反应可能通过表面还原机制或Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制进行，具体取决于催化剂。
