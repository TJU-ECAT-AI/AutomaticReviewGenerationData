[1] "Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chro- mium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity."
[2] "The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species."
[3] "Over the most active Cr6.8/MCM-41 catalyst the yield of propene and selectivity to propene are 34.9% and 88.5%, respectively at 823 K."
[4] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy- drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction."
[5] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

1. Supported chromium oxide-based materials have been identified as the most promising catalysts due to their high catalytic activity.
2. The high activity of chromium oxide catalysts in both dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is linked to the dispersion of chromium species.
3. The Cr6.8/MCM-41 catalyst shows the highest yield of propene (34.9%) and selectivity (88.5%) at 823 K.
4. The CO2-promoting effect on propene yield isn't solely due to direct oxidation of propane but also through coupling with the RWGS reaction.
5. The high RWGS activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts contributes to the higher propene yield.

1. 支持的铬氧化物基材料被指出是活性最高的催化剂，因为它们具有很高的催化活性。
2. 铬氧化物催化剂在脱氢和RWGS反应中的高活性与分散的铬物种的存在有关。
3. 在823 K时，Cr6.8/MCM-41催化剂的丙烯产率最高（34.9%），选择性最高（88.5%）。
4. CO2促进丙烯产率不仅归因于丙烷的直接氧化，还与其与RWGS反应耦合促进简单脱氢有关。
5. MCM-41支持的铬氧化物催化剂的高RWGS活性是观察到更高丙烯产率的另一个原因。
