[1] "It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2."
[2] "Moreover, in the latter cases not all Cr atoms are accessible to reactants, what has also negative effect on the catalytic activity."
[3] "It has been proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes."
[4] "The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+)."
[5] "The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehy- drogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction."
[6] "The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene."

1. The dispersion of chromium species plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity of chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP. At high chromium loadings, not all chromium atoms are accessible to reactants, negatively impacting catalytic activity. Mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies on the catalyst surface are particularly active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

2. Chromium(III) species, including Cr3+, are precursors for active chromium species with lower oxidation states, such as Cr2+ and Cr3+. These active species are formed from dispersed chromium(III) species present on the support surface.

3. The presence of chromium(III) species on the surface of the MCM-41 support contributes significantly to the high catalytic activity of chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction. This high activity is an additional factor that explains the observed higher yield of propene.

4. The coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the RWGS reaction is a key mechanism for the observed enhancement of propene yield in the presence of CO2. This synergy allows for more efficient use of CO2 in the production of propene, contributing to the catalyst's overall performance.

1. 铬物种的分散对于CO2-ODHP中的铬氧化物催化剂的催化活性至关重要。在高铬负载下，不是所有铬原子对反应物可及，这会负面影响催化活性。表面具有两个配位空位的单核Cr3+物种在轻烷烃脱氢反应中特别活跃。

2. 包括Cr3+在内的铬（III）物种是形成活性铬物种（如Cr2+和Cr3+）的前体。这些活性物种是在支持表面上分散的铬（III）物种形成的。

3. MCM-41支持下的铬氧化物催化剂在RWGS反应中的高度活性是其产生更高丙烯产量的另一个关键因素。这种高活性是解释观察到的丙烯产量增加的额外原因。

4. 丙烷脱氢与RWGS反应的耦合是观察到在CO2存在下丙烯产率提高的关键机制。这种协同作用允许更有效地利用CO2来生产丙烯，从而提高了催化剂的整体性能。
