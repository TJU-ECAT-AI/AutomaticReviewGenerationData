[1] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[3] "Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[5] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxide-based materials, are considered promising for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH) due to their high activity and selectivity. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are critical factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH processes.

2. The dealumination process significantly affects the catalytic properties of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. This process leads to an improvement in catalytic performance compared to the original aluminum-containing Beta zeolite.

3. The SiBeta support, obtained through dealumination, offers a suitable acidity level that facilitates high selectivity towards propene production (over 80%). Conversely, the high acidity present in the starting aluminum-containing Beta zeolite promotes propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons.

4. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene increases over chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts. However, over chromium-containing aluminum Beta zeolite catalysts, a negative effect on the rate of propene formation is observed.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是铬氧化物基材料，在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）过程中因其高活性和选择性而被认为具有很大的潜力。高分散性和红氧化铬物种的存在是实现CO2-PDH过程高催化性能的关键因素。

2. 处理过程显著影响含铬Beta沸石催化剂的催化性质。这一过程导致与原始铝含量的Beta沸石相比，催化剂性能的显著改善。

3. 经过处理得到的硅基Beta支持材料提供了适当的酸度水平，有利于高选择性丙烯生产（超过80％）。相反，起始铝含量较高的Beta沸石的高酸度促进丙烷裂解为较轻的烃类。

4. 在丙烷脱氢模式的切换操作中，存在和不存在CO2，丙烯的形成速率在含有铬的硅基Beta沸石催化剂上增加。然而，在含有铬的铝基Beta沸石催化剂上观察到丙烯形成速率的负面效应。
