1. Chromium oxide-based materials are considered promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are crucial factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.
2. Ordered mesoporous silica supports are superior for ensuring high chromium dispersion compared to γ-Al2O3 and active carbon.
3. CO2 addition can poison γ-Al2O3-supported chromium oxide catalysts, limiting their application in CO2-PDH, while active carbon requires periodic regeneration with air.
4. Beta zeolites, especially after dealumination, were explored as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. This procedure led to the development of excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH.

1. 铬氧化物基材料由于其高活性和选择性，被认为是CO2-PDH的很有前景的选择。高度分散以及红氧化铬物种的存在是实现CO2-PDH高催化性能的重要因素。
2. 有序介孔硅酸盐支持在确保铬氧化物高度分散方面优于γ-Al2O3和活性炭。
3. CO2添加会毒化γ-Al2O3支持的铬氧化物催化剂，限制其在CO2-PDH中的应用，而活性碳需要周期性的空气再生。
4. 在存在CO2的情况下，研究了Beta沸石作为丙烷脱氢催化剂的可能性。通过这一过程，开发出了适用于CO2-PDH的优秀催化剂。
