[1] "Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[2] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[3] "The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in presence of CO2 is complex. Various possible scenarios of the CO2-PDH in which propene is produced either by non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of Cr(II) or/and Cr(III) species or by various redox mechanisms with participation of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant in an oxidative dehydrogenation pathway have been proposed."
[4] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[5] "From above reasons chromium is typically dispersed on a support. Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."

The study investigates the effect of dealumination on the catalytic performance of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH). The catalysts are prepared through a two-step process: first, removing aluminum from the TEABeta zeolite to create an aluminum-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio of 1000. Then, various amounts of chromium are introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure via wet impregnation. The research highlights that the dealumination process significantly impacts the catalytic properties of the chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves complex pathways, including non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of chromium(II) or chromium(III) species, as well as redox mechanisms where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are identified as crucial factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, is considered an excellent support for dispersing chromium oxide catalysts.

研究探讨了铝去除对含铬Beta沸石催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）中的催化性能的影响。催化剂通过两步制备过程获得：首先，从TEABeta沸石中去除铝以生成铝含量为零、Si/Al比为1000的硅Beta支持物。然后，通过湿浸渍将不同量的铬引入硅Beta沸石结构中。研究表明，铝去除过程对含铬Beta沸石催化剂的催化性质产生了重大影响。丙烷脱氢过程中CO2的作用机制复杂，包括非氧化性脱氢与铬(II)或铬(III)物种参与的途径，以及CO2作为温和氧化剂参与氧化性脱氢路径的各种还原性循环。高分散性和红氧化铬物种的存在被认为是实现CO2-PDH高催化性能的关键因素。尤其是有序介孔结构的硅是分散铬氧化物催化剂的理想支持物。
