[2] "It has been recognized that high dispersion and presence of redox chromium species are important factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH."
[3] "Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts were obtained by two-step postsynthesis preparation procedure which consist, in the first step, removal of aluminum from TEABeta zeolite with Si/Al of 17 by treatment with nitric acid solution to obtain an aluminium-free SiBeta support with Si/Al ratio of 1000 and, in the second step, various amounts of Cr were introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure by wet impregnation."
[4] "Comparing of catalytic activity of Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts with the identical Cr content (2 wt % of Cr) supported on SiBeta and AlBeta revealed that the dealumination has great impact on catalytic properties."
[5] "Low acidity of SiBeta is suitable for achieving high selectivity to propene (above 80 %) while high acidity of starting AlBeta promotes propane cracking to lighter hydrocarbons."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxide-based materials, are considered promising for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH) due to their high activity and selectivity. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are critical factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH processes.

2. The dealumination process significantly affects the catalytic properties of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. This process leads to an improvement in catalytic performance compared to the original aluminum-containing Beta zeolite.

3. The SiBeta support, obtained through dealumination, offers a suitable acidity level that facilitates high selectivity towards propene production (over 80%). Conversely, the high acidity present in the starting aluminum-containing Beta zeolite promotes propane cracking into lighter hydrocarbons.

4. In switch operation mode between propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2, the formation rate of propene increases over chromium-containing SiBeta zeolite catalysts. However, over chromium-containing aluminum Beta zeolite catalysts, a negative effect on the rate of propene formation is observed.

3. 经过处理得到的硅基Beta支持材料提供了适当的酸度水平，有利于高选择性丙烯生产（超过80％）。相反，起始铝含量较高的Beta沸石的高酸度促进丙烷裂解为较轻的烃类。

4. 在丙烷脱氢模式的切换操作中，存在和不存在CO2，丙烯的形成速率在含有铬的硅基Beta沸石催化剂上增加。然而，在含有铬的铝基Beta沸石催化剂上观察到丙烯形成速率的负面效应。

The study investigates the effect of dealumination on the catalytic performance of chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts in CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH). The catalysts are prepared through a two-step process: first, removing aluminum from the TEABeta zeolite to create an aluminum-free SiBeta support with a high Si/Al ratio of 1000. Then, various amounts of chromium are introduced into the siliceous SiBeta zeolite structure via wet impregnation. The research highlights that the dealumination process significantly impacts the catalytic properties of the chromium-containing Beta zeolite catalysts. The mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 involves complex pathways, including non-oxidative dehydrogenation with participation of chromium(II) or chromium(III) species, as well as redox mechanisms where CO2 acts as a mild oxidant. High dispersion and the presence of redox chromium species are identified as crucial factors for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH. Silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, is considered an excellent support for dispersing chromium oxide catalysts.

研究探讨了铝去除对含铬Beta沸石催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-PDH）中的催化性能的影响。催化剂通过两步制备过程获得：首先，从TEABeta沸石中去除铝以生成铝含量为零、Si/Al比为1000的硅Beta支持物。然后，通过湿浸渍将不同量的铬引入硅Beta沸石结构中。研究表明，铝去除过程对含铬Beta沸石催化剂的催化性质产生了重大影响。丙烷脱氢过程中CO2的作用机制复杂，包括非氧化性脱氢与铬(II)或铬(III)物种参与的途径，以及CO2作为温和氧化剂参与氧化性脱氢路径的各种还原性循环。高分散性和红氧化铬物种的存在被认为是实现CO2-PDH高催化性能的关键因素。尤其是有序介孔结构的硅是分散铬氧化物催化剂的理想支持物。
