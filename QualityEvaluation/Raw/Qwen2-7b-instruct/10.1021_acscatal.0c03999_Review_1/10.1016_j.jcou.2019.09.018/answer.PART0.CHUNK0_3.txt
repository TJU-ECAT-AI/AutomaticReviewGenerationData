[1] "Among them, the chromium oxide-based materials are considered as a very promising for CO2-PDH due to high activity and selectivity."
[2] "Typically in this process per-pass conversion of propane and yield of propene are higher than in commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation."
[3] "From above reasons chromium is typically dispersed on a support."
[4] "Very good support ensuring high chromium dispersion is silica, particularly of ordered mesoporous structure."
[5] "We have shown that dealumination of Beta and subsequently chromium dispersion by simple impregnation procedure give excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH."

1. Chromium oxide-based materials are considered highly promising for CO2-PDH due to their high activity and selectivity compared to other materials. 
2. CO2-PDH typically exhibits higher propane conversion and propene yield than non-oxidative dehydrogenation processes.
3. Dispersion of chromium on a support is essential for achieving high catalytic performance in CO2-PDH.
4. Silica, especially of ordered mesoporous structure, provides excellent support for high dispersion and concentration of chromium oxide species.
5. Dealumination of Beta zeolite followed by a simple impregnation procedure results in superior catalysts for CO2-PDH.
