The study investigates Cr-containing Beta zeolite catalysts for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-PDH). The researchers find that dealumination of Beta zeolite and subsequent chromium dispersion through a simple impregnation procedure results in excellent catalysts for CO2-PDH. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include the dispersion of chromium oxide species and the presence of redox chromium species. The use of silica, especially ordered mesoporous silica, as a support ensures high chromium dispersion and activity.
