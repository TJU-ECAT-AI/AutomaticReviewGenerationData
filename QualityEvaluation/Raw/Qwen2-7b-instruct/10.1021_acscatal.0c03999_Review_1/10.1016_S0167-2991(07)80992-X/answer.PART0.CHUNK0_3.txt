The study investigates the catalytic performance of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in cracking C4-olefin to produce propylene. The acid strength of these samples follows the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite, while their stability in catalytic tests follows the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite, particularly the one with small crystal size, shows the highest stability for a long time-on-stream. This zeolite is found to be the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene among the three studied samples.

研究探讨了H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34沸石在裂解C4-烯烃生成丙烯的催化性能。这些样品的酸强度顺序为H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite，而它们在催化测试中的稳定性顺序为H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite。在长时间连续操作中，具有较小晶粒尺寸的H-ZSM-5沸石显示出最高的稳定性。研究表明，在研究的三种样品中，H-ZSM-5沸石是裂解C4-烯烃生成丙烯的最佳催化剂。
