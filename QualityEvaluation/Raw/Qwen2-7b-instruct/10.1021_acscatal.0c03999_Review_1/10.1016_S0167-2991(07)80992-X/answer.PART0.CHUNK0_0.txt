"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
"Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study compared the catalytic performances of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in the cracking of C4-olefin. The researchers synthesized these zeolites using different directing agents and tested their effectiveness in converting C4-olefin into propylene. They found that the acid strength and stability of these zeolites followed the orders H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34>H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite, respectively. Among them, H-ZSM-5 was identified as the most suitable catalyst for C4-olefin cracking due to its high propylene yield and resistance to deactivation, particularly when it had a smaller crystal size.

研究比较了H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34这三种沸石在C4-烯烃裂解中的催化性能。研究人员使用不同的导向剂合成了这些沸石，并测试了它们将C4-烯烃转化为丙烯的效果。他们发现，这些沸石的酸性和稳定性遵循着H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34>H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite的顺序。其中，H-ZSM-5被认定为最适合C4-烯烃裂解的催化剂，因为它具有高丙烯产率和抗失活能力，特别是当其晶粒尺寸较小时。
