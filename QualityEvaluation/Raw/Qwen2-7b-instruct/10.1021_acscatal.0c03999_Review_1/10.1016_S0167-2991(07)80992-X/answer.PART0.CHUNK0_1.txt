Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene.
The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream.
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low.

The document investigates the use of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin. It finds that H-SAPO-34 has the weakest acid strength among the three, followed by H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite. Stability in catalytic tests follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite is the most suitable for producing propylene from C4-olefin cracking, especially when its small crystal size is utilized. Propylene yields from FCC units are lower compared to using these zeolites.

本文研究了H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34在C4-烯烃裂解反应中的应用。发现H-SAPO-34的酸强度最弱，其次是H-ZSM-5和H-mordenite。催化测试稳定性按顺序排列为：H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite。H-ZSM-5是利用C4-烯烃裂解产生丙烯的最佳催化剂，特别是当其采用小晶粒时。与使用这些沸石的FCC装置相比，从丙烯裂解产生的丙烯产量较低。
