[Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34]
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene.
The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream.

Propylene is a critical feedstock in the petrochemical industry, facing supply deficits due to increased demand for propylene derivatives. Zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 were evaluated for catalytic cracking of C4-olefins to produce propylene. H-ZSM-5 was identified as the optimal catalyst for this process, especially when it has a smaller crystal size, which exhibits higher stability over longer periods.
