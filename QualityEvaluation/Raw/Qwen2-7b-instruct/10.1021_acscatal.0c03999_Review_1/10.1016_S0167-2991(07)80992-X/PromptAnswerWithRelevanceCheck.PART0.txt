"Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34"
"Zeolites ZSM-5, mordenite and SAPO-34 were synthesized hydrothermally, using hexamethylenediamine(HMDA), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEABr) and morpholine as directing agents, respectively."
"It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite."
"The H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene."
"Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream."

The study compared the catalytic performances of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in the cracking of C4-olefin. The researchers synthesized these zeolites using different directing agents and tested their effectiveness in converting C4-olefin into propylene. They found that the acid strength and stability of these zeolites followed the orders H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34>H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite, respectively. Among them, H-ZSM-5 was identified as the most suitable catalyst for C4-olefin cracking due to its high propylene yield and resistance to deactivation, particularly when it had a smaller crystal size.

Catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin over zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite and H-SAPO-34
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene.
It was found that the acid strength of these samples followed the order of H-SAPO-34<H-ZSM-5<H-mordenite;and their stability in the catalytic test followed the order of H-SAPO-34 H-ZSM-5>H-mordenite.
Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite was the optimal catalyst for C4-olefin cracking to produce propylene.
The H-ZSM-5 zeolite with small crystal size exhibited higher stability than the H-ZSM-5 with large crystal size for a long time-on-stream.
Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low.

The document investigates the use of zeolites H-ZSM-5, H-mordenite, and H-SAPO-34 in catalytic cracking reactions of C4-olefin. It finds that H-SAPO-34 has the weakest acid strength among the three, followed by H-ZSM-5 and H-mordenite. Stability in catalytic tests follows the order of H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite is the most suitable for producing propylene from C4-olefin cracking, especially when its small crystal size is utilized. Propylene yields from FCC units are lower compared to using these zeolites.

本文研究了H-ZSM-5、H-mordenite和H-SAPO-34在C4-烯烃裂解反应中的应用。发现H-SAPO-34的酸强度最弱，其次是H-ZSM-5和H-mordenite。催化测试稳定性按顺序排列为：H-SAPO-34 > H-ZSM-5 > H-mordenite。H-ZSM-5是利用C4-烯烃裂解产生丙烯的最佳催化剂，特别是当其采用小晶粒时。与使用这些沸石的FCC装置相比，从丙烯裂解产生的丙烯产量较低。

[C1] "Propylene is one of the most important basic organic feedstocks and is currently faced with a serious supply deficit in petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in demand for propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene."
[C2] "The traditional methods for increasing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example, the naphtha steam cracking process [1, 2], which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene, is a costly route because of the enormous capital investment and the high feedstock cost."
[C3] "Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield is relatively low."
[C4] "And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is not attractive since it will consume the same high-value ethylene as the main feedstock."
[C5] "One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants from less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins [1-8]."
[C6] "Zeolites, because of their outstanding thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity and shape selectivity, have been widely used in industrial processes [9-11]."
[C7] "In this paper, we explored the possibility to produce propylene via catalytic cracking of surplus C4-olefin over three typical catalysts, namely H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5 and H-SAPO-34."
[C8] "Among these samples, the H-ZSM-5 zeolite is by far the most appropriate zeolite catalyst in terms of both the resistance to deactivation and the propylene yield."

The document discusses the challenges in increasing propylene yield from traditional methods like naphtha steam cracking, which results in high costs due to the significant production of ethylene compared to propylene. It mentions the inefficiency of producing propylene through FCC units and the unattractiveness of the metathesis process for ethylene and butylenes due to the consumption of high-value ethylene. The paper explores the use of catalytic cracking of mixed C4- or higher carbon olefins as an alternative method for propylene production, highlighting the role of zeolites due to their thermal and hydrothermal stability, acidity, and shape selectivity in industrial processes. Among the three catalysts tested, H-ZSM-5 zeolite stands out as the most suitable for propylene production, exhibiting high stability and propylene yield.

文档讨论了从传统方法增加丙烯产量的挑战，如焦化裂解过程，这导致了高成本，因为丙烯的产量与乙烯相比非常低。它提到了通过FCC单元生产丙烯的效率低下，并且由于消耗了高价值的乙烯，乙烯和丁烯的甲基化过程不具吸引力。该论文探讨了使用混合C4或更高碳烯烃的催化裂解作为丙烯生产的替代方法，并强调了由于其热稳定性和水热稳定性、酸性和形状选择性，在工业过程中广泛使用的沸石的作用。在测试的三种催化剂中，H-ZSM-5沸石在耐失活性和丙烯产率方面脱颖而出，成为最适合丙烯生产的最佳沸石催化剂。
