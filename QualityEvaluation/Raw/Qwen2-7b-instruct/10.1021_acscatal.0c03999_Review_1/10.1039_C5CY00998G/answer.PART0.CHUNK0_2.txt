[1] "Among the heterogeneous catalysts tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant, materials based on chromium supported on silica exhibited the most promising performances."
[2] "In all cases the only chromium species found were surface chromates (diffuse reflectance electronic spectroscopy and X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy), accompanied by Brnsted acid centres (infra-red spectra of adsorbed NH3)."
[3] "All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained."
[4] "When O2 was used for ODH (alone or mixed with CO2) their average oxidation state should be +3."

1. Chromium-supported silica materials showed the most promising performance among the heterogeneous catalysts tested with CO2 as an oxidant.
2. Surface chromates and Brnsted acid centers were identified as the only chromium species present.
3. The catalysts demonstrated stability against irreversible deactivation, achieving propene yields up to 40% after 900 minutes of testing.
4. The average oxidation state of chromium sites was +3 when oxygen was used as the oxidant in ODH processes.

1. 铬支持的硅材料在以二氧化碳作为氧化剂的催化剂中表现出了最令人鼓舞的性能。
2. 表面铬酸盐和Brnsted酸中心被确认为存在的唯一铬物种。
3. 催化剂显示出对不可逆失活的稳定性，即使在长达900分钟的测试后也能达到高达40%的丙烯产率。
4. 当氧气被用作单独或与二氧化碳混合的氧化剂时，在氧化脱氢过程中，铬的平均氧化状态应为+3。
