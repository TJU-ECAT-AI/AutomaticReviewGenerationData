[1] "Propene (C3H6) is among the foundation feedstock for large volume commodities and specialty chemicals, such as cumene, acrylonitrile,propylene oxide and high-purity polypropylene, and its demand is expected to increase significantly in the near future."
[2] "Among the heterogeneous catalysts tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant, materials based on chromium supported on silica exhibited the most promising performances."
[3] "Cr/SiO2 catalysts (Cr loading in the 0.25-2.0 wt% range) have been prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis in the presence of templating agents, in order to attain porous systems with high specific surface area (in the 600-1000 m2g-1 range), and then characterized and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidant."
[4] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."
[5] "All the investigated catalysts appeared stable towards possible irreversible deactivation in the ODH of propane, in reaction conditions as close as possible to industrial applications, and allowed the attainment of yields in propene (and total olefins) among the highest reported in the literature."
[6] "It seems reasonable to propose that thise possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent."

1. Propene is a key raw material for producing various commodities and specialty chemicals. Its demand is projected to rise significantly in the near future.
2. Chromium-based catalysts supported on silica showed the most promising performance among those tested with CO2 as an oxidant in heterogeneous catalytic processes.
3. Cr/SiO2 catalysts with a chromium loading in the range of 0.25-2.0 wt% were synthesized through direct hydrothermal methods, aiming for high specific surface area and tested for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 or CO2+O2 as oxidants.
4. Chromium was found as highly dispersed surface chromate species on the catalysts, and the number of active sites (as Lewis acid centers) was directly proportional to the chromium loading.
5. The catalysts demonstrated stability and allowed achieving high yields of propene and total olefins in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, comparable to the highest reported in the literature.
6. The difference in chromium oxidation state could influence the selectivity and yield of propene and ethene depending on the oxidant used in the reaction.
