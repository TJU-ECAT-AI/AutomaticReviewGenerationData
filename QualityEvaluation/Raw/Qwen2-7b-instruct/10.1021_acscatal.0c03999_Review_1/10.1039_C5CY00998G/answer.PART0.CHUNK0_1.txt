<p>The extent and regularity of mesopores decreased significantly by increasing the Cr content (X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption, transmission electron microscopy), but this did not limit the catalytic performances of the catalysts with higher Cr loadings.</p>
<p>All catalysts appeared stable towards irreversible deactivation, even after ca. 900 min of testing, and yields in propene as high as 40% were attained.</p>
<p>The results of the characterization activity reported above (section 3.2) indicated that the speciation of Cr can be considered equivalent for all catalysts.</p>
<p>Noticeably, these performances were reproduced after each catalyst regeneration.</p>
<p>The most important result is represented by the yield in the two olefins resulting from ODH in the presence of CO2 as oxidant (panel A, curve b): the initial C3H6 yield was of ca. 47% (see also Table 2 and related comment).</p>
<p>However, even higher C3H6 yields were obtained using the CO2+O2 mixture (curve d).</p>
<p>Conversely, the spectra of the catalyst used for ODH with O2 or O2+CO2 as oxidant (curves c and d) exhibited a double edge at higher energy (5999 and 6003 eV) and two weak pre-edge peaks 5990 and 5993 eV.</p>
<p>These three features appeared very similar to those present in the spectrum of Cr2O3 reference compound.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to propose that this possible difference in oxidation state of Cr sites might contribute to the origin of differences in selectivity, and then yield, in C3H6 and C2H4 in dependence on the oxidation agent.</p>

1. The catalytic performance of Cr/SiO2 catalysts was not hindered by the decrease in mesopore regularity as chromium content increased. The catalysts showed stability against irreversible deactivation and achieved high propene yields up to 40%.

2. The results were reproducible after regenerating the catalysts, indicating durability. 

3. A significant yield of 47% in propene was achieved using CO2 as the oxidant. 

4. Using a CO2+O2 mixture resulted in even higher propene yields.

5. During oxidative dehydrogenation with O2 or O2+CO2, the XANES spectra revealed a different oxidation state of chromium sites, possibly contributing to variations in selectivity and yield in propene and ethene.

1. 随着Cr含量的增加，介孔的规则性降低并未影响催化剂的催化性能。催化剂表现出对不可逆失活的稳定性，并达到了高达40%的丙烯产率。

2. 这些结果在催化剂再生后可以重复，表明其耐用性。

3. 使用CO2作为氧化剂时，实现了47%的高丙烯产率。

4. 使用CO2+O2混合物获得了更高的丙烯产率。

5. 在使用O2或O2+CO2进行氧化脱氢过程中，XANES光谱揭示了铬位点的不同氧化状态，可能对丙烯和乙烷的选择性和产率产生影响。
