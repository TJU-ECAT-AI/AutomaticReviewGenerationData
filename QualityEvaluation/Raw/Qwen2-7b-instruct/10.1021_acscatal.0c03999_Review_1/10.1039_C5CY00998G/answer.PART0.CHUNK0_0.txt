[1] "Among the heterogeneous catalysts tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant, materials based on chromium supported on silica exhibited the most promising performances."
[2] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."
[3] "The observed decrease in propane conversion should be attributed to coke formation, that affected in a different way the activity of the various catalysts, likely resulting from the combination of different textural features (e.g., porous structures could be more easily blocked by coke) and different amount of Brnsted acid sites (increasing as the Cr content increased), as well as reversible changes in the speciation of supported Cr species (see below)."
[4] "When only O2 was used as oxidant, small amounts of CO and CO2 (yield of ca. 3% for both) were also detected."
[5] "The spectrum of the catalyst used for ODH with O2+CO2 as oxidant was characterized, in the white-line region, by a weak, ill resolved doublet at 6008 and 6010 eV, which can result from multiple-scattering contributions of Cr2O3-like particles."

1. Materials containing chromium supported on silica showed the most potential in catalytic processes utilizing CO2 as an oxidant.

2. Chromium was present in the form of highly dispersed surface chromates, with the quantity of Cr sites directly proportional to the chromium loading, assessed in terms of their behavior as Lewis acid centers towards ammonia.

3. The decrease in propane conversion was attributed to coke formation, affecting the activity of various catalysts differently due to the combination of varying textural characteristics, such as porous structures that were more susceptible to blockage by coke, differing amounts of Brnsted acid sites that increased with higher chromium content, and reversible changes in the chromium species' speciation.

4. Using only oxygen as an oxidant led to the production of small amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, accounting for approximately 3% of both substances.

5. The XANES spectrum of the catalyst used for ODH with O2+CO2 as oxidant exhibited a weak, poorly resolved doublet at 6008 and 6010 eV in the white-line region, indicative of multiple-scattering contributions from chromium oxide-like particles.

1. 含有铬的硅基材料在利用二氧化碳作为氧化剂的过程中的表现最为突出。

2. 铬以高度分散的表面铬酸盐形式存在，铬位点的数量与铬装载量成线性关系，根据它们对氨的行为作为Lewis酸中心进行评估。

3. 烯烃转化率的下降归因于焦炭的形成，这种焦炭以不同的方式影响各种催化剂的活性，这可能源于多孔结构更易被焦炭堵塞，不同量的布恩斯德酸位点随铬含量增加而增加，以及支持的铬物种的谱态的可逆变化。

4. 只使用氧气作为氧化剂导致生成少量的一氧化碳和二氧化碳，这两种物质的产量分别为大约3%。

5. 在使用氧气和二氧化碳混合物作为氧化剂的ODH过程中使用的催化剂的XANES光谱在白色线区域显示出一个弱的、不清晰的双峰，位于6008和6010 eV，这可能是由于从类似铬酸盐粒子的多重散射贡献。
