[1] "Among the heterogeneous catalysts tested in processes involving CO2 as oxidant, materials based on chromium supported on silica exhibited the most promising performances."
[2] "All chromium was present as highly dispersed surface chromate species, and the amount of Cr sites (evaluated in terms of their behaviour as Lewis acid centres towards NH3) was found linearly proportional to the Cr loading."
[3] "When CO2 is used as oxidant in ODH, the average oxidation state of Cr sites can be as low as +2, whereas it can be as low as 3+ in the presence of (also) O2 as oxidant."

1. Chromium supported on silica catalysts showed the most promising performance in processes involving CO2 as an oxidant.
2. The amount of chromium sites, assessed as Lewis acid centers towards ammonia, increased linearly with the chromium loading.
3. In the presence of CO2 as an oxidant, the average oxidation state of chromium sites was +2, while it could be +3 in the presence of oxygen.
