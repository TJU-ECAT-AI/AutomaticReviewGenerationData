1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly those with chromium loading higher than 0.5 wt%, show improved activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. Key factors influencing their performance include the evolution of chromium species on the catalyst surface. As the chromium loading increases, the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface improves, enhancing catalytic activity. The highest activity was observed in catalysts with a 6.0 wt% chromium loading, yielding 69% propene. 

2. The selectivity for propylene was notably high, exceeding 80%, and ethylene was produced as the main by-product. The yield of propylene was approximately 40% and increased for catalysts with chromium loading greater than 0.5 wt%.

3. Metal vapor synthesis (MVS) enables optimization of the catalyst system, improving activity per chromium atom and dispersing chromium species effectively on the silica surface, even at high loading levels. 

4. The catalytic activity is closely tied to the presence of various chromate species grafted onto the silica surface. Higher chromium loadings beyond 6.0 wt% lead to the formation of -Cr2O3 particles, which are inactive in the investigated process, rather than further increasing the dispersion of chromium species.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是那些铬含量超过0.5 wt%的催化剂，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中显示出改进的活性和选择性。影响其性能的关键因素包括催化剂表面铬物种的演变。随着铬含量的增加，二氧化硅表面的铬物种分散性提高，增强催化活性。在6.0 wt%铬负载的催化剂中观察到最高活性，产丙烯量为69%。

2. 丙烯的选择性显著高，超过80%，乙烷作为主要副产物产生。丙烯的产率约为40%，对于铬负载大于0.5 wt%的催化剂而言有所增加。

3. 金属蒸气合成（MVS）使催化剂系统优化成为可能，提高了每铬原子的活性，并有效分散了二氧化硅表面上的铬物种，即使是在高负载水平下也是如此。

4. 催化活性与粘附在二氧化硅表面的各种铬酸盐物种的存在密切相关。超过6.0 wt%的更高铬负载导致形成-Cr2O3颗粒，这些颗粒在研究过程中是不活跃的，而不是进一步增加铬物种的分散性。
