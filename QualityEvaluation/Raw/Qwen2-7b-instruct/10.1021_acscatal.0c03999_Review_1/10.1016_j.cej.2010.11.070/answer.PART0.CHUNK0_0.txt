[1] "In the present work catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
[2] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
[3] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
[4] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface."
[5] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono-or poly-chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."
[6] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts show differing activities and selectivities for CO2-ODHP. Supported Cr2O3 catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity, with the presence of chromate species on the silica surface being crucial. The dispersion of chromium species is optimized with metal vapour synthesis, enhancing catalytic performance.

2. The highest catalytic activity was observed in a catalyst with 6.0 wt% chromium loading, yielding 69% propene.

3. The metal vapour synthesis technique optimizes the system in terms of activity per chromium atom, enabling the preparation of highly dispersed chromium species on the silica surface.

4. The catalytic activity is linked to the presence of various nuclearities of chromate species grafted onto the silica surface.

5. Beyond a 6.0 wt% chromium loading, the formation of -Cr2O3 particles occurs, which are not active in the studied process. 

6. The creation of surface chromate species is accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, which contribute to coke production and are more prevalent with higher chromium content.
