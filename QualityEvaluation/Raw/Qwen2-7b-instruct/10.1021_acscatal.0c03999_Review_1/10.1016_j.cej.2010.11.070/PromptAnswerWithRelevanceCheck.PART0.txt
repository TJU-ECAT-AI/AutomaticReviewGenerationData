1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly those with chromium loading higher than 0.5 wt%, show improved activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. Key factors influencing their performance include the evolution of chromium species on the catalyst surface. As the chromium loading increases, the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface improves, enhancing catalytic activity. The highest activity was observed in catalysts with a 6.0 wt% chromium loading, yielding 69% propene. 

2. The selectivity for propylene was notably high, exceeding 80%, and ethylene was produced as the main by-product. The yield of propylene was approximately 40% and increased for catalysts with chromium loading greater than 0.5 wt%.

3. Metal vapor synthesis (MVS) enables optimization of the catalyst system, improving activity per chromium atom and dispersing chromium species effectively on the silica surface, even at high loading levels. 

4. The catalytic activity is closely tied to the presence of various chromate species grafted onto the silica surface. Higher chromium loadings beyond 6.0 wt% lead to the formation of -Cr2O3 particles, which are inactive in the investigated process, rather than further increasing the dispersion of chromium species.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是那些铬含量超过0.5 wt%的催化剂，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应中显示出改进的活性和选择性。影响其性能的关键因素包括催化剂表面铬物种的演变。随着铬含量的增加，二氧化硅表面的铬物种分散性提高，增强催化活性。在6.0 wt%铬负载的催化剂中观察到最高活性，产丙烯量为69%。

2. 丙烯的选择性显著高，超过80%，乙烷作为主要副产物产生。丙烯的产率约为40%，对于铬负载大于0.5 wt%的催化剂而言有所增加。

3. 金属蒸气合成（MVS）使催化剂系统优化成为可能，提高了每铬原子的活性，并有效分散了二氧化硅表面上的铬物种，即使是在高负载水平下也是如此。

4. 催化活性与粘附在二氧化硅表面的各种铬酸盐物种的存在密切相关。超过6.0 wt%的更高铬负载导致形成-Cr2O3颗粒，这些颗粒在研究过程中是不活跃的，而不是进一步增加铬物种的分散性。

[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content (Table 1, Part A)."

[3] "The catalyst with Cr loading of 10.0 wt% showed a decrease of specific surface area of ca. 20% with a further loss of total pore volume and a sharp decrease of average pore diameter that should result from the filling or blockage of the smallest pores by chromium species."

The document discusses how various metal oxide catalysts, specifically chromium-based catalysts, compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the evolution of chromium species in supported chromium (Cr2O3) catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The text highlights that metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows optimizing the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and obtaining highly dispersed chromium species on the silica surface, up to high chromium loadings. The selectivity to main products, such as propylene, is higher than 80% for catalysts with chromium loadings above 0.5 wt%. The activity and selectivity seem to peak around 6.0 wt% chromium loading, after which the catalysts start to show less activity due to the formation of -Cr2O3 particles, which are not active in the investigated process. The presence of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, increases with higher chromium contents.

The specific surface area decreases with an increase in chromium content, affecting the total pore volume and average pore diameter. The text also mentions the evolution of textural features, such as the presence of irregular particles mainly composed of silica, with a mapping of the location of chromium and silica confirming the presence of highly dispersed chromium on the silica surface. The DR UVVis spectroscopy shows an increase in intensity and a light shift of bands related to monochromates, di-, and polychromates with an increase in chromium loading. The FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 indicates the presence of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to deactivation of the catalysts by cocking.

The catalytic tests reveal that the initial propane conversion, selectivity towards olefins, and olefins yield increase with the increase of chromium loading up to 6.0 wt%. Beyond this loading, the catalysts show a decrease in propane conversion and olefin yield, possibly due to the formation of inactive -Cr2O3 particles. The selectivity to propene slightly decreases with an increase in chromium content. Long-term tests confirm the comparable catalytic activity of a catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading to a catalyst with ten times higher chromium loading, suggesting that the higher dispersion of chromium species leads to a comparable amount of active centers on the surface.

文档讨论了各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是铬基催化剂，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性的比较。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括支持铬（Cr2O3）催化剂中铬物种随负载和载体性质变化的演变。文本指出，金属蒸汽合成（MVS）技术可以优化系统以实现每克铬原子的活性，并在高铬负载下获得高度分散的铬物种在硅酸盐表面。对于铬负载大于0.5 wt%的催化剂，主产品丙烯的选择性高于80%。活性和选择性似乎在6.0 wt%铬负载时达到峰值，之后由于形成不活跃的-Cr2O3颗粒，催化剂开始显示出较低的活性。与较高铬含量相关的Brnsted酸中心的存在促进了初始生成的烯烃的转化，导致催化剂通过结焦过程失效。

特定表面积随着铬含量的增加而降低，影响总孔体积和平均孔直径。文本还提到了纹理特征的变化，如主要由二氧化硅组成的不规则颗粒的存在，以及使用能量色散X射线光谱（EDS）地图确认了表面上高度分散的铬的存在。紫外可见光度谱（DR UVVis）显示，随着铬负载的增加，与单铬酸盐、二铬酸盐和多铬酸盐相关的波长的强度增加，并且向高频偏移。红外（IR）光谱吸附氨表明催化剂表面上存在Brnsted酸中心，这可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转换，导致催化剂通过结焦过程失效。

催化测试显示，随着铬负载的增加，初始丙烷转化率、烯烃选择性和烯烃产率增加到6.0 wt%。超过这个负载后，催化剂显示出丙烷转化率和烯烃产率的下降，这可能是由于形成不活跃的-Cr2O3颗粒所致。丙烯的选择性随着铬含量的增加略有下降。长期测试证实，具有0.5 wt%铬负载的催化剂的催化活性与具有十倍更高铬负载的催化剂相当，这表明更高的分散的铬物种导致表面相等数量的活性中心。

1. Various metal oxide catalysts were compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The selectivity to main product propylene was found to be higher than 80% for the majority of the catalysts, and ethylene was identified as the main by-product. The yield of propylene ranged from around 40% to higher levels, depending on the chromium loading. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance included the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface and the presence of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface.

2. As the chromium loading increased from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, the specific surface area of the catalysts decreased slightly, but the total pore volume showed a more significant decrease at higher chromium loadings. The porosity of the catalysts remained similar to that of the bare support up to a chromium loading of 6.0 wt%, indicating that the dispersed chromium particles did not block the silica pores.

3. The presence of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface was noted as a factor that could promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, potentially leading to the deactivation of the catalysts through a process called "cocking". These acid sites were observed to be more abundant at higher chromium contents.

4. The long-term tests conducted on the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading showed an initial conversion of propane of approximately 42%, which decreased to around 28% in 400 minutes and remained stable for the next 400 minutes. For comparison, the 5.0 wt% Cr/SiO2-WI catalyst had an initial conversion of propane at 45%, which reduced to around 30% in 400 minutes and continued to decrease. Despite the different initial conversion rates, the catalytic activities of the two catalysts were nearly identical, suggesting that the higher dispersion of chromium species on the surface of the 0.5 wt% MVS catalyst led to a comparable amount of active centers to that of the 5.0 wt% WI catalyst.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性进行了比较。丙烯的主要选择性超过了80%，乙烷被识别为主要副产品。丙烯的产率从约40%到更高水平不等，具体取决于铬负载量。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括二氧化硅表面分散的铬物种以及催化剂表面的布郎斯特酸中心的存在。

2. 随着从0.25到6.0 wt%的铬负载增加，催化剂的比表面积略有下降，但总孔体积在更高铬负载时显示出更大的减少。在6.0 wt%的铬负载下，催化剂的孔隙率与裸支持物保持相似，表明分散的铬颗粒并未堵塞二氧化硅孔隙。

3. 发现催化剂表面存在的布郎斯特酸中心可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转化，可能通过一个称为“自燃”的过程导致催化剂失活。这些酸中心在高铬含量的情况下更为丰富。

4. 在对MVS催化剂进行的长时间测试中，0.5 wt%铬负载的催化剂在最初的丙烷转化率为约42%，在400分钟后降低至约28%，然后在接下来的400分钟内保持稳定。相比之下，5.0 wt% Cr/SiO2-WI催化剂的丙烷初始转化率为45%，在400分钟后降至约30%，并继续下降。尽管初始转化率不同，两种催化剂的催化活性几乎相同，这表明0.5 wt% MVS催化剂表面上的高分散铬物种导致了与5.0 wt% WI催化剂表面上的活性中心相仿的数量。
