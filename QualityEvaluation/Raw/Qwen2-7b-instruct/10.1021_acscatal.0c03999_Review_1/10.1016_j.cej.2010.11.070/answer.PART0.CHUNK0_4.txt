[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content."
[2] "Up to the Cr loading of 6.0 wt% the porosity of the catalysts was similar to that exhibited by the bare support, indicating that highly dispersed chromium particles do not block silica pores."
[3] "The presence of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface are an object of interest as such centres can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, in particular starting the processes leading to the deactivation of the catalysts by cocking."
[4] "The results of the long-term tests for the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading are reported in Fig. 5, curves 1. For the sake of comparison on the same figure the results of the similar test for the WI catalyst with ten times higher chromium loading (5.0 wt%) are presented (curves 2)."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts were compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The selectivity to main product propylene was found to be higher than 80% for the majority of the catalysts, and ethylene was identified as the main by-product. The yield of propylene ranged from around 40% to higher levels, depending on the chromium loading. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance included the dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface and the presence of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface.

2. As the chromium loading increased from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, the specific surface area of the catalysts decreased slightly, but the total pore volume showed a more significant decrease at higher chromium loadings. The porosity of the catalysts remained similar to that of the bare support up to a chromium loading of 6.0 wt%, indicating that the dispersed chromium particles did not block the silica pores.

3. The presence of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface was noted as a factor that could promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, potentially leading to the deactivation of the catalysts through a process called "cocking". These acid sites were observed to be more abundant at higher chromium contents.

4. The long-term tests conducted on the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading showed an initial conversion of propane of approximately 42%, which decreased to around 28% in 400 minutes and remained stable for the next 400 minutes. For comparison, the 5.0 wt% Cr/SiO2-WI catalyst had an initial conversion of propane at 45%, which reduced to around 30% in 400 minutes and continued to decrease. Despite the different initial conversion rates, the catalytic activities of the two catalysts were nearly identical, suggesting that the higher dispersion of chromium species on the surface of the 0.5 wt% MVS catalyst led to a comparable amount of active centers to that of the 5.0 wt% WI catalyst.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性进行了比较。丙烯的主要选择性超过了80%，乙烷被识别为主要副产品。丙烯的产率从约40%到更高水平不等，具体取决于铬负载量。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括二氧化硅表面分散的铬物种以及催化剂表面的布郎斯特酸中心的存在。

2. 随着从0.25到6.0 wt%的铬负载增加，催化剂的比表面积略有下降，但总孔体积在更高铬负载时显示出更大的减少。在6.0 wt%的铬负载下，催化剂的孔隙率与裸支持物保持相似，表明分散的铬颗粒并未堵塞二氧化硅孔隙。

3. 发现催化剂表面存在的布郎斯特酸中心可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转化，可能通过一个称为“自燃”的过程导致催化剂失活。这些酸中心在高铬含量的情况下更为丰富。

4. 在对MVS催化剂进行的长时间测试中，0.5 wt%铬负载的催化剂在最初的丙烷转化率为约42%，在400分钟后降低至约28%，然后在接下来的400分钟内保持稳定。相比之下，5.0 wt% Cr/SiO2-WI催化剂的丙烷初始转化率为45%，在400分钟后降至约30%，并继续下降。尽管初始转化率不同，两种催化剂的催化活性几乎相同，这表明0.5 wt% MVS催化剂表面上的高分散铬物种导致了与5.0 wt% WI催化剂表面上的活性中心相仿的数量。
