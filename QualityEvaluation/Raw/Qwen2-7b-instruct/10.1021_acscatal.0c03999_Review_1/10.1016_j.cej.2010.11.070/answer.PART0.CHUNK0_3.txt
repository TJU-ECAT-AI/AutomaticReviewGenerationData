[1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content (Table 1, Part A)."
[2] "For the sake of comparison, the values for the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation method (hereafter: CrSiO2-WI) are also reported [5] (Table 1, Part B)."
[3] "The catalyst with Cr loading of 10.0 wt% showed a decrease of specific surface area of ca. 20% with a further loss of total pore volume and a sharp decrease of average pore diameter that should result from the filling or blockage of the smallest pores by chromium species."
[4] "In the bigger fragment of the catalyst the presence of Si is also observed (Fig. 2C)."
[5] "The presence of these bands is the evidence of oxygen to Cr6+ CT transitions of monochromates, di- and/or polychromates grafted to the SiO2 surface [27a,28]."
[6] "By increasing the Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% (Fig. 3, panel A, curves 15) all mentioned bands progressively increased in intensity and underwent a light shift towards high frequency, but no other band was observed."
[7] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."
[8] "The results of the long-term tests for the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading are reported in Fig. 5, curves 1."

The document discusses how various metal oxide catalysts, specifically chromium-based catalysts, compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the evolution of chromium species in supported chromium (Cr2O3) catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The text highlights that metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows optimizing the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and obtaining highly dispersed chromium species on the silica surface, up to high chromium loadings. The selectivity to main products, such as propylene, is higher than 80% for catalysts with chromium loadings above 0.5 wt%. The activity and selectivity seem to peak around 6.0 wt% chromium loading, after which the catalysts start to show less activity due to the formation of -Cr2O3 particles, which are not active in the investigated process. The presence of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, increases with higher chromium contents.

The specific surface area decreases with an increase in chromium content, affecting the total pore volume and average pore diameter. The text also mentions the evolution of textural features, such as the presence of irregular particles mainly composed of silica, with a mapping of the location of chromium and silica confirming the presence of highly dispersed chromium on the silica surface. The DR UVVis spectroscopy shows an increase in intensity and a light shift of bands related to monochromates, di-, and polychromates with an increase in chromium loading. The FTIR spectroscopy of adsorbed NH3 indicates the presence of Brnsted acid sites on the catalyst surface, which can promote the transformation of initially produced olefins, leading to deactivation of the catalysts by cocking.

The catalytic tests reveal that the initial propane conversion, selectivity towards olefins, and olefins yield increase with the increase of chromium loading up to 6.0 wt%. Beyond this loading, the catalysts show a decrease in propane conversion and olefin yield, possibly due to the formation of inactive -Cr2O3 particles. The selectivity to propene slightly decreases with an increase in chromium content. Long-term tests confirm the comparable catalytic activity of a catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading to a catalyst with ten times higher chromium loading, suggesting that the higher dispersion of chromium species leads to a comparable amount of active centers on the surface.

文档讨论了各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是铬基催化剂，在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性的比较。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括支持铬（Cr2O3）催化剂中铬物种随负载和载体性质变化的演变。文本指出，金属蒸汽合成（MVS）技术可以优化系统以实现每克铬原子的活性，并在高铬负载下获得高度分散的铬物种在硅酸盐表面。对于铬负载大于0.5 wt%的催化剂，主产品丙烯的选择性高于80%。活性和选择性似乎在6.0 wt%铬负载时达到峰值，之后由于形成不活跃的-Cr2O3颗粒，催化剂开始显示出较低的活性。与较高铬含量相关的Brnsted酸中心的存在促进了初始生成的烯烃的转化，导致催化剂通过结焦过程失效。

特定表面积随着铬含量的增加而降低，影响总孔体积和平均孔直径。文本还提到了纹理特征的变化，如主要由二氧化硅组成的不规则颗粒的存在，以及使用能量色散X射线光谱（EDS）地图确认了表面上高度分散的铬的存在。紫外可见光度谱（DR UVVis）显示，随着铬负载的增加，与单铬酸盐、二铬酸盐和多铬酸盐相关的波长的强度增加，并且向高频偏移。红外（IR）光谱吸附氨表明催化剂表面上存在Brnsted酸中心，这可以促进初始生成的烯烃的转换，导致催化剂通过结焦过程失效。

催化测试显示，随着铬负载的增加，初始丙烷转化率、烯烃选择性和烯烃产率增加到6.0 wt%。超过这个负载后，催化剂显示出丙烷转化率和烯烃产率的下降，这可能是由于形成不活跃的-Cr2O3颗粒所致。丙烯的选择性随着铬含量的增加略有下降。长期测试证实，具有0.5 wt%铬负载的催化剂的催化活性与具有十倍更高铬负载的催化剂相当，这表明更高的分散的铬物种导致表面相等数量的活性中心。
