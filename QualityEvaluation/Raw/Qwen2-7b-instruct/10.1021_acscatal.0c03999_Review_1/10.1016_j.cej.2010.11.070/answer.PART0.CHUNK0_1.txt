[1] "In the present work catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
[2] "This method let to obtain on the catalyst surface a high dispersed chromium species even at high chromium loadings."
[3] "On the surface of the catalysts with the chromium loading up to 6.0 wt% only chromate species were found, the further increase of the chromium loading results in the appearance of the -Cr2O3."
[4] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
[5] "The selectivity to main product propylene was higher than 80% and as a main by-product it was produced another olefin ethylene."
[6] "Consequently, the yield of propylene was ca. 40% and higher for all studied catalysts with the chromium loading higher than 0.5 wt%."

1. Metal vapor synthesis was used to study catalysts for CO2-assisted propane oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP). The method allowed for the formation of highly dispersed chromium species, even at high chromium loadings.
2. Chromium species were only chromate species at a loading up to 6.0 wt%. Above this, -Cr2O3 particles were observed on the catalyst surface.
3. The catalyst with a 6.0 wt% chromium loading demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, achieving a propene yield of 69%.
4. The catalysts produced propylene with a selectivity higher than 80% and ethylene as the main by-product.
5. The yield of propylene was around 40% or higher for catalysts with a chromium loading greater than 0.5 wt%.

1. 使用金属蒸气合成法研究了CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）的催化剂。该方法允许在高铬负载下形成高度分散的铬物种。
2. 在6.0 wt%负载以下，表面仅发现铬酸盐物种。超过此值，在催化剂表面上出现-Cr2O3颗粒。
3. 含有6.0 wt%铬的催化剂表现出最高的催化活性，丙烯产率为69%。
4. 催化剂以大于80%的选择性生产丙烯，并以乙烯为主要副产物。
5. 铬负载大于0.5 wt%的催化剂的丙烯产率约为40%或更高。
