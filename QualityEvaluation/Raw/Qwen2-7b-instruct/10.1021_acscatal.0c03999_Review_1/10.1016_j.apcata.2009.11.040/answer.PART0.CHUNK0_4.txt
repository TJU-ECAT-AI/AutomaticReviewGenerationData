[1] "In the case of the most active, 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst, the effect of various reaction parameters such as, reaction temperature, reaction time and feed gas composition on the conversion of propane, yield and selectivity to propene as well as on molar ratio of CO/H2 has been evaluated."
[2] "Moreover, stability of the catalyst during the dehydrogenation/regeneration conditions was studied as well."
[3] "It has been found that during the fourth consecutive cycle the catalyst undergoes two types of deactivation processes - reversible and irreversible."
[4] "The former is caused mainly by the coke deposition, which can easily overcome by air treatment of the catalyst at 550 8C."
[5] "The latter one, insignificant, is due to partial collapse of mesoporous structure of the catalysts."
[6] "Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2."
[7] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings, where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expected."
[8] "At higher Cr loadings and low dispersion non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."

1. The most active catalyst, 0.04CrSBA1, was assessed for the impact of reaction temperature, time, and gas composition on propane conversion, propene yield, selectivity, and CO/H2 ratio. The catalyst's stability under dehydrogenation and regeneration conditions was also studied. After four cycles, the catalyst experienced reversible and irreversible deactivation, with coke deposition being the main cause of reversible deactivation, which can be reversed through air treatment at 550°C. Irreversible deactivation, less significant, was attributed to partial collapse of the catalyst's mesoporous structure.

2. Chromium-containing mesoporous sieves demonstrated superior catalytic activity in both propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2.

1. 最活跃的催化剂，0.04CrSBA1，被评估了反应温度、时间以及气体组成对丙烷转化、丙烯产率、选择性和CO/H2比的影响。在降解和再生条件下催化剂的稳定性也被研究。在连续四次循环后，催化剂经历了可逆和不可逆的失活，可逆失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积，可以通过在550°C的空气中处理催化剂来逆转。不可逆失活相对不显著，是由催化剂的介孔结构的部分塌陷引起的。

2. 含有铬的介孔筛表现出在有或没有二氧化碳的情况下对丙烷脱氢的优异催化活性。
