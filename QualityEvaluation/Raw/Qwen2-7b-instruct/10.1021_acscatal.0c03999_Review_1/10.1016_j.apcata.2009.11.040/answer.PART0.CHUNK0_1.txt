[1] "Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2."
[2] "Moreover, it has been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive effect exerted by CO2 is different."
[3] "In the case of gallium oxide- based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities."
[5] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide- based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."
[6] "In the case of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the redox Cr species (mainly Cr6+ in form of chromates or polychromates) are dominant at low Cr loadings,where a high degree of Cr dispersion is expect, while at higher Cr loadings and low dispersion nonredox polymeric Cr3+ species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present."
[7] "Although SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural prop- erties the studies concerning their application in catalysis are limited, compared with other mesoporous materials such as hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15."
[8] "Up to now, only a few efforts have been made to incorporate Cr [27] or other heteroatoms like Ga [25], Ti [2830], V [31,32], Co [33], Al [34,35] Mo [36] and Fe [28,3739], Pd [40] into the SBA-1 for catalytic purpose."
[9] "The newly discovered SBA-1 mesoporous silica material has high potential to be applied as a catalyst support, because of its unique textural properties."
[10] "Moreover, cubic mesoporous phase is mechanically more stable compared to hexagonal mesoporous materials, such as: SBA-15 and MCM-41 [26]."

1. Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. The positive effects of CO2 on these catalysts differ. For gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 reduces coke formation and increases propene yield by removing hydrogen. In contrast, chromium oxide-based catalysts show an enhancing effect of CO2 on propene yield due to its oxidative capabilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts involves Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, chromium precursor, and support nature. At lower chromium loadings, redox Cr species (Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) are dominant, while at higher loadings, non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 may also be present. SBA-1 materials have unique textural properties that make them promising catalyst supports, although their use in catalysis is still limited compared to other mesoporous materials. Incorporating metals like Cr, Ga, Ti, V, Co, Al, Mo, Fe, or Pd into SBA-1 for catalytic purposes is challenging due to difficulties in preparation under strong acidic conditions. Despite this, SBA-1 materials offer high potential as catalyst supports due to their cubic mesoporous phase being mechanically more stable than hexagonal mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41.

1. 铬和镓氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢过程中最为活跃、选择性高且稳定。这些催化剂对二氧化碳的积极影响不同。对于镓氧化物基催化剂，二氧化碳减少了焦炭形成并通过移除脱氢反应中生成的氢气提高了丙烯产量。相比之下，铬氧化物基催化剂通过其氧化能力，二氧化碳促进了丙烯产量的提高。在铬氧化物基催化剂中的还原机制涉及Cr物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+），其浓度主要取决于铬负载、制备条件、铬前体和支撑性质。在较低铬负载下，主要存在还原Cr物种（以铬酸盐或多铬酸盐形式的Cr6+），而较高负载下，非还原聚合态Cr3+物种以及结晶Cr2O3也可能出现。SBA-1材料具有独特的纹理特性，使其作为催化剂支持具有巨大潜力，尽管它们在催化应用方面的研究仍然有限，与六方MCM-41或SBA-15等其他微孔材料相比。将金属如Cr、Ga、Ti、V、Co、Al、Mo、Fe或Pd引入SBA-1用于催化目的的挑战在于强酸条件下难以准备。尽管如此，SBA-1材料因其立方微孔相比于六方微孔材料（如SBA-15和MCM-41）具有更高的机械稳定性而显示出巨大的潜力作为催化剂支持。
