[1] "Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2."
[2] "Furthermore, it has been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive effect exerted by CO2 is different."
[3] "In the case of gallium oxide- based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction."
[4] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities."
[5] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide- based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."
[6] "Moreover, it has been found that the over the latter mentioned catalysts positive effect exerted by CO2 is different."
[7] "Taking to assume above it could be conclude that in order to obtain more active chromium oxide-based catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 a high dispersion of the chromium oxide species at Cr loadings as high as possible should be achieved."
[8] "From those reasons, more attention has been dedicated recently toward mesoporous sieves."
[9] "SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural properties."
[10] "The latter feature is important for industrial applications where the catalyst powders are subjected to shaping process."
[11] "Although SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural properties the studies concerning their application in catalysis are limited."
[12] "In this work we investigated the catalytic activity of Cr- containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with different Cr loadings,prepared by the direct method."
[13] "All the xCrSBA1 catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffusion reflectance, N2-adsorption and temperature- programmed reduction experiments (H2-TPR)."
[14] "Finally, the catalyt- ic performance of the xCrSBA1 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with CO2 was evaluated."

1. Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts show different activities, selectivities, and stabilities in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. Gallium oxide catalysts benefit from CO2 by suppressing coke formation and enhancing propene yield through hydrogen removal. Chromium oxide catalysts are promoted by CO2 due to its oxidative capabilities.
2. The redox behavior of chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) in chromium oxide catalysts is crucial for their catalytic performance, influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, precursor compounds, and support characteristics.
3. For obtaining more active chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane, achieving high dispersion of chromium oxide species at high loadings is essential.
4. Mesoporous sieves, particularly SBA-1 materials, have attracted attention due to their unique structural properties, including high surface area and mechanical stability.
5. Despite the potential of SBA-1 materials in catalysis, their applications are limited compared to other mesoporous materials such as hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15.
6. In the study, the catalytic activity of Cr-containing SBA-1 catalysts with different chromium loadings was evaluated for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane.

1. 铬和镓氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢反应中的活性、选择性和稳定性存在差异。镓氧化物催化剂通过抑制焦炭形成和通过移除脱氢反应中产生的氢气来提高丙烯产率而受益于二氧化碳。铬氧化物催化剂通过其氧化能力促进二氧化碳对丙烯产率的影响。
2. 铬氧化物催化剂中的可逆和不可逆两种类型的失活过程主要由铬物种（Cr6+，Cr5+或Cr3+）的浓度决定，该浓度主要依赖于铬负载量、制备条件、铬前体化合物以及支持材料特性。
3. 要获得用于二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢的更活跃的铬氧化物催化剂，应尽可能实现高分散的铬氧化物种负载。
4. 多孔筛，尤其是SBA-1材料，由于其独特的结构特性（如高比表面积和机械稳定性）而受到关注。
5. 尽管SBA-1材料在催化应用方面的潜力，但它们的应用仍然有限，与六方MCM-41或SBA-15等其他多孔材料相比。
6. 在研究中，评价了不同铬负载的Cr掺杂SBA-1催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢中的催化性能。
