[1] "Among them,much attention has been dedicated to chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts, which are the most active, selective and stable in the process with CO2 [1,47,922]."
[2] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction [1719]."
[3] "In contrast, in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is due to its oxidative abilities."
[4] "Redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."
[5] "Cr-containing mesoporous sieves have an excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene with and without CO2 [5,11,1315]."
[6] "SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural properties. In particular, it has a three-dimensional channels (Pm3n) ranging from 2.1 to 2.6 nm and specific surface area in the range 12001450 m2 g1."
[7] "Although SBA-1 materials possess interesting structural properties the studies concerning their application in catalysis are limited, compared with other mesoporous materials such as hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15."
[8] "The main reasons for that is difficulty with preparation of template with large head- groups (e.g. alkyltriethylammonium bromide) and incorporation of heteroatoms (mainly in cationic form) into the SBA-1 frameworks under strong acidic conditions."

In the context of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane, chromium oxide-based catalysts exhibit the most active, selective, and stable performance compared to gallium oxide-based catalysts. Gallium oxide catalysts mitigate deactivation due to coke formation and enhance propene yield by removing hydrogen generated during the dehydrogenation reaction. Chromium oxide catalysts, on the other hand, benefit from CO2's oxidative capabilities, which positively impact propene yield. The redox behavior of chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) in chromium oxide catalysts is crucial and depends on the chromium loading, preparation conditions, chromium precursor, and support nature. Incorporating chromium into mesoporous silica frameworks, particularly those of the SBA-1 type, has been found to significantly enhance catalytic activity in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts offer superior performance compared to traditional SiO2 supports due to their large surface area and unique three-dimensional pore network. However, the application of SBA-1 materials in catalysis is still limited compared to other mesoporous materials like hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15, primarily due to the challenges in preparing templates with large head groups and incorporating heteroatoms under strong acidic conditions.

在CO2辅助下丙烷脱氢的背景下，铬氧化物基催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出与其他镓氧化物基催化剂相比的优势。镓氧化物催化剂通过减少焦炭形成导致的活性下降，并通过移除脱氢反应中生成的氢气来增强丙烯产率。相比之下，铬氧化物催化剂受益于CO2的氧化能力，这促进了丙烯产率的提升。在铬氧化物催化剂中，铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+ 或 Cr3+）的还原-氧化行为至关重要，其浓度主要取决于铬负载量、制备条件、铬前体和支撑材料的性质。将铬纳入介孔二氧化硅体系，特别是SBA-1型，已被发现显著提高了CO2辅助下丙烷脱氢的催化活性。与传统SiO2支持相比，这些催化剂得益于其巨大的表面积和独特的三维孔网络结构。然而，与六方MCM-41或SBA-15等其他介孔材料相比，SBA-1材料在催化应用方面的研究仍然有限，主要原因是难以在强酸性条件下制备具有大头基团的模板以及向SBA-1框架中引入杂原子。
