[1] "In the case of gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 suppresses partially deactivation by coke formation and enhances the yield of propene by removal of H2 that is formed in the dehydrogenation reaction."
[2] "The redox mechanism, proposed in the case of chromium oxide-based catalysts, needs the redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+ or Cr3+), whose concentration depends mainly on the chromium loading, the preparation conditions, the precursor compound of chromium and nature of support."
[3] "Moreover, cubic mesoporous phase is mechanically more stable compared to hexagonal mesoporous materials, such as: SBA-15 and MCM-41."
[4] "In this work we investigated the catalytic activity of Cr-containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with different Cr loadings, prepared by the direct method."
[5] "Up to now, only a few efforts have been made to incorporate Cr or other heteroatoms like Ga, Ti, V, Co, Al, Mo, and Fe into the SBA-1 for catalytic purpose."

1. Gallium oxide-based catalysts show a partial suppression of deactivation due to coke formation and an enhancement of propene yield through the removal of hydrogen formed during the dehydrogenation process. In contrast, chromium oxide-based catalysts require redox Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) for their mechanism, with the concentration of these species influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, chromium precursor, and support nature.
2. The cubic mesoporous structure of materials is more mechanically stable compared to hexagonal mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15 and MCM-41.
3. The study focuses on the catalytic performance of chromium-containing SBA-1 catalysts (xCrSBA1) with varying chromium loadings, synthesized through a direct method.
4. Until now, only a limited number of attempts have been made to integrate chromium or other heteroatoms like gallium, titanium, vanadium, cobalt, aluminum, molybdenum, and iron into the SBA-1 framework for catalytic applications.

1. 在镓氧化物催化剂中，二氧化碳部分抑制了焦炭形成导致的活性下降，并通过去除脱氢反应中形成的氢气提高了丙烯产率。相比之下，铬氧化物催化剂需要进行氧化还原Cr物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+），这些物种的浓度主要取决于铬负载、制备条件、铬前体和支撑材料的性质。
2. 与六方介孔材料相比，如SBA-15和MCM-41，立方介孔结构的材料在机械稳定性上表现更好。
3. 研究关注不同铬负载的铬含SBA-1催化剂（xCrSBA1）的催化性能，这些催化剂通过直接方法合成。
4. 到目前为止，仅有限的努力尝试将铬或其它杂原子如镓、钛、钒、钴、铝、钼和铁整合到SBA-1框架中用于催化应用。
