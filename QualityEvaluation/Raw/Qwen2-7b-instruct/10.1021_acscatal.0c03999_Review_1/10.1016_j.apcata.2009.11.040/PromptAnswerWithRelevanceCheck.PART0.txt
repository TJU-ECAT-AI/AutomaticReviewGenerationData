1. Chromium and gallium oxide-based catalysts are the most active, selective, and stable in the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. The positive effects of CO2 on these catalysts differ. For gallium oxide-based catalysts, CO2 reduces coke formation and increases propene yield by removing hydrogen. In contrast, chromium oxide-based catalysts show an enhancing effect of CO2 on propene yield due to its oxidative capabilities. The redox mechanism in chromium oxide-based catalysts involves Cr species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) whose concentration is influenced by chromium loading, preparation conditions, chromium precursor, and support nature. At lower chromium loadings, redox Cr species (Cr6+ as chromates or polychromates) are dominant, while at higher loadings, non-redox polymeric Cr3+ species and crystalline Cr2O3 may also be present. SBA-1 materials have unique textural properties that make them promising catalyst supports, although their use in catalysis is still limited compared to other mesoporous materials. Incorporating metals like Cr, Ga, Ti, V, Co, Al, Mo, Fe, or Pd into SBA-1 for catalytic purposes is challenging due to difficulties in preparation under strong acidic conditions. Despite this, SBA-1 materials offer high potential as catalyst supports due to their cubic mesoporous phase being mechanically more stable than hexagonal mesoporous materials like SBA-15 and MCM-41.

1. 铬和镓氧化物基催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢过程中最为活跃、选择性高且稳定。这些催化剂对二氧化碳的积极影响不同。对于镓氧化物基催化剂，二氧化碳减少了焦炭形成并通过移除脱氢反应中生成的氢气提高了丙烯产量。相比之下，铬氧化物基催化剂通过其氧化能力，二氧化碳促进了丙烯产量的提高。在铬氧化物基催化剂中的还原机制涉及Cr物种（Cr6+、Cr5+或Cr3+），其浓度主要取决于铬负载、制备条件、铬前体和支撑性质。在较低铬负载下，主要存在还原Cr物种（以铬酸盐或多铬酸盐形式的Cr6+），而较高负载下，非还原聚合态Cr3+物种以及结晶Cr2O3也可能出现。SBA-1材料具有独特的纹理特性，使其作为催化剂支持具有巨大潜力，尽管它们在催化应用方面的研究仍然有限，与六方MCM-41或SBA-15等其他微孔材料相比。将金属如Cr、Ga、Ti、V、Co、Al、Mo、Fe或Pd引入SBA-1用于催化目的的挑战在于强酸条件下难以准备。尽管如此，SBA-1材料因其立方微孔相比于六方微孔材料（如SBA-15和MCM-41）具有更高的机械稳定性而显示出巨大的潜力作为催化剂支持。

In the context of CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane, chromium oxide-based catalysts exhibit the most active, selective, and stable performance compared to gallium oxide-based catalysts. Gallium oxide catalysts mitigate deactivation due to coke formation and enhance propene yield by removing hydrogen generated during the dehydrogenation reaction. Chromium oxide catalysts, on the other hand, benefit from CO2's oxidative capabilities, which positively impact propene yield. The redox behavior of chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, or Cr3+) in chromium oxide catalysts is crucial and depends on the chromium loading, preparation conditions, chromium precursor, and support nature. Incorporating chromium into mesoporous silica frameworks, particularly those of the SBA-1 type, has been found to significantly enhance catalytic activity in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts offer superior performance compared to traditional SiO2 supports due to their large surface area and unique three-dimensional pore network. However, the application of SBA-1 materials in catalysis is still limited compared to other mesoporous materials like hexagonal MCM-41 or SBA-15, primarily due to the challenges in preparing templates with large head groups and incorporating heteroatoms under strong acidic conditions.

在CO2辅助下丙烷脱氢的背景下，铬氧化物基催化剂在活性、选择性和稳定性方面表现出与其他镓氧化物基催化剂相比的优势。镓氧化物催化剂通过减少焦炭形成导致的活性下降，并通过移除脱氢反应中生成的氢气来增强丙烯产率。相比之下，铬氧化物催化剂受益于CO2的氧化能力，这促进了丙烯产率的提升。在铬氧化物催化剂中，铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+ 或 Cr3+）的还原-氧化行为至关重要，其浓度主要取决于铬负载量、制备条件、铬前体和支撑材料的性质。将铬纳入介孔二氧化硅体系，特别是SBA-1型，已被发现显著提高了CO2辅助下丙烷脱氢的催化活性。与传统SiO2支持相比，这些催化剂得益于其巨大的表面积和独特的三维孔网络结构。然而，与六方MCM-41或SBA-15等其他介孔材料相比，SBA-1材料在催化应用方面的研究仍然有限，主要原因是难以在强酸性条件下制备具有大头基团的模板以及向SBA-1框架中引入杂原子。

[1] "In the case of the most active, 0.04CrSBA1 catalyst, the effect of various reaction parameters such as, reaction temperature, reaction time and feed gas composition on the conversion of propane, yield and selectivity to propene as well as on molar ratio of CO/H2 has been evaluated."
[2] "Moreover, stability of the catalyst during the dehydrogenation/regeneration conditions was studied as well."
[3] "It has been found that during the fourth consecutive cycle the catalyst undergoes two types of deactivation processes - reversible and irreversible."
[4] "The former is caused mainly by the coke deposition, which can easily overcome by air treatment of the catalyst at 550 8C."

1. The most active catalyst, 0.04CrSBA1, was assessed for the impact of reaction temperature, time, and gas composition on propane conversion, propene yield, selectivity, and CO/H2 ratio. The catalyst's stability under dehydrogenation and regeneration conditions was also studied. After four cycles, the catalyst experienced reversible and irreversible deactivation, with coke deposition being the main cause of reversible deactivation, which can be reversed through air treatment at 550°C. Irreversible deactivation, less significant, was attributed to partial collapse of the catalyst's mesoporous structure.

2. Chromium-containing mesoporous sieves demonstrated superior catalytic activity in both propane dehydrogenation with and without CO2.

1. 最活跃的催化剂，0.04CrSBA1，被评估了反应温度、时间以及气体组成对丙烷转化、丙烯产率、选择性和CO/H2比的影响。在降解和再生条件下催化剂的稳定性也被研究。在连续四次循环后，催化剂经历了可逆和不可逆的失活，可逆失活的主要原因是焦炭沉积，可以通过在550°C的空气中处理催化剂来逆转。不可逆失活相对不显著，是由催化剂的介孔结构的部分塌陷引起的。

2. 含有铬的介孔筛表现出在有或没有二氧化碳的情况下对丙烷脱氢的优异催化活性。
