[1] "Mn-MCM-41 was found to be the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using TBPH as an oxidant among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe- and Mo-containing MCM-41."
[2] "As suggested by the characterizations with ESR, XANES, UVVIS and UVRaman, both Mn2+ and Mn3+ coexisted on the Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by both DHT and TIE methods, and some Mn cations might be incorporated into the framework of MCM-41 in the DHT samples."
[3] "The epoxidation of both styrene and stilbene using TBHP as the oxidant afforded the corresponding epoxides."
[4] "The TIE sample exhibited higher conversion of styrene and stilbene than the DHT sample with the same Mn content, but the DHT sample afforded higher TBHP efficiency."

1.Mn-MCM-41 was identified as the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe-, and Mo-MCM-41 samples.
2.Research findings indicated that both Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions coexist within the Mn-MCM-41 samples synthesized via both the direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template ion exchange (TIE) methods. Some Mn ions might have been integrated into the framework of MCM-41 through the DHT process.
3.The epoxidation of both styrene and stilbene using TBHP resulted in the formation of the respective epoxides.
4.In comparison, the TIE catalyst demonstrated superior styrene and stilbene conversion rates relative to the DHT catalyst, despite the latter offering a higher TBHP efficiency.

1.在使用tert-丁基过氧化氢（TBHP）作为氧化剂的条件下，Mn-MCM-41被确定为催化苯乙烯环氧化反应最有效的催化剂，与其他含Mn、V、Cr、Fe和Mo的MCM-41样品相比。
2.研究结果表明，在通过直接水热法（DHT）和模板离子交换（TIE）方法合成的Mn-MCM-41中，均存在Mn2+和Mn3+两种离子。部分Mn离子可能通过DHT过程被整合到MCM-41的框架结构中。
3.使用TBHP作为氧化剂对苯乙烯和苯二烯进行环氧化反应，分别生成了相应的环氧产物。
4.与DHT催化剂相比，TIE催化剂在相同Mn含量下表现出更高的苯乙烯和苯二烯转化率，尽管DHT催化剂提供了更高的TBHP效率。
