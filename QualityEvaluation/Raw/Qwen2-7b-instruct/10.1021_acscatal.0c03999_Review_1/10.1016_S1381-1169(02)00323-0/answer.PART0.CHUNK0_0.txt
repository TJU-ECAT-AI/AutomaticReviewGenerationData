[1] "Mn-MCM-41 was found to be the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using TBPH as an oxidant among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe- and Mo-containing MCM-41."
[2] "As suggested by the characterizations with ESR, XANES, UVVIS and UVRaman, both Mn2+ and Mn3+ coexisted on the Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by both DHT and TIE methods, and some Mn cations might be incorporated into the framework of MCM-41 in the DHT samples."
[3] "The epoxidation of both styrene and stilbene using TBHP as the oxidant afforded the corresponding epoxides."
[4] "The TIE sample exhibited higher conversion of styrene and stilbene than the DHT sample with the same Mn content, but the DHT sample afforded higher TBHP efficiency."

The document does not provide information about how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The text focuses on the epoxidation of styrene and stilbene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant over Mn-MCM-41 catalysts synthesized by direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template ion exchange (TIE) methods. It discusses the coexistence of Mn2+ and Mn3+ on the Mn-MCM-41 catalysts, the higher efficiency of TBHP over the DHT samples, and the similar product distributions for the epoxidation of styrene and stilbene. There is no information regarding the comparison of other metal oxide catalysts or the evolution of chromium species in the context provided.

文档没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在对CO2-ODHP的活性和选择性的比较信息，也没有讨论支持的Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种随负载和支撑性质变化的情况。文本关注于使用叔丁基过氧化氢（TBHP）作为氧化剂对苯乙烯和邻二甲苯进行环氧化，Mn-MCM-41催化剂通过直接水热（DHT）法和模板离子交换（TIE）法制备的情况。它讨论了Mn2+和Mn3+在Mn-MCM-41催化剂上的共存、DHT样品的高TBHP效率以及对苯乙烯和邻二甲苯进行环氧化的相似产物分布。没有关于其他金属氧化物催化剂的比较或铬物种进化的信息。
