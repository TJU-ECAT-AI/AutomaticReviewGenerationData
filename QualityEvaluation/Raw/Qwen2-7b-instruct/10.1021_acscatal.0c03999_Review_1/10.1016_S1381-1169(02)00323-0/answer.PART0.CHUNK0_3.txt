[1] "Mn-MCM-41 was found to be the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using TBPH as an oxidant among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe- and Mo-containing MCM-41."
[2] "The oxidation of styrene gave two main products, i.e. styrene oxide and benzaldehyde (abbreviated as Sty.oxide and Benzald., respectively in Tables 1, 4 and 5)."
[3] "Among the tested samples, Mn-MCM-41 showed no leaching and gave the highest selectivity to styrene oxide (81.9%) as well as the highest TBHP efficiency (100%)."
[4] "It is likely that the Mn sites on the surface of mesoporous channels are more active than those incorporated inside the framework."
[5] "As described above, different synthetic methods would lead to active species with different nature and coordination environments."
[6] "The TIE sample exhibited higher conversion of styrene and stilbene than the DHT sample with the same Mn content, but the DHT sample afforded higher TBHP efficiency."

1.Mn-MCM-41 was identified as the most efficient catalyst for epoxidizing styrene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe-, and Mo-containing MCM-41 materials. 
2.The epoxidation of styrene results in the formation of styrene oxide and benzaldehyde as primary products.
3.Mn-MCM-41 demonstrated no leaching property and offered the highest selectivity for styrene oxide production (81.9%) and the highest TBHP efficiency (100%) among the tested catalysts.
4.It appears that the manganese sites on the surface of mesoporous channels exhibit greater activity than those within the framework.
5.Different synthetic techniques yield active species with varying characteristics and coordination environments.
6.In comparison, the TIE sample displayed higher styrene and stilbene conversion rates than the DHT sample with equivalent Mn content, while the DHT sample had a higher TBHP efficiency.
