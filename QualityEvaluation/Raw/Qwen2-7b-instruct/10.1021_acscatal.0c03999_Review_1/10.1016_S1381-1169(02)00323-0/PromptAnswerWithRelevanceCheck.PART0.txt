[1] "Mn-MCM-41 was found to be the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using TBPH as an oxidant among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe- and Mo-containing MCM-41."
[2] "As suggested by the characterizations with ESR, XANES, UVVIS and UVRaman, both Mn2+ and Mn3+ coexisted on the Mn-MCM-41 synthesized by both DHT and TIE methods, and some Mn cations might be incorporated into the framework of MCM-41 in the DHT samples."
[3] "The epoxidation of both styrene and stilbene using TBHP as the oxidant afforded the corresponding epoxides."
[4] "The TIE sample exhibited higher conversion of styrene and stilbene than the DHT sample with the same Mn content, but the DHT sample afforded higher TBHP efficiency."

The document does not provide information about how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, nor does it discuss the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The text focuses on the epoxidation of styrene and stilbene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant over Mn-MCM-41 catalysts synthesized by direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template ion exchange (TIE) methods. It discusses the coexistence of Mn2+ and Mn3+ on the Mn-MCM-41 catalysts, the higher efficiency of TBHP over the DHT samples, and the similar product distributions for the epoxidation of styrene and stilbene. There is no information regarding the comparison of other metal oxide catalysts or the evolution of chromium species in the context provided.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study reveals that manganese-containing MCM-41 is the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). This process likely involves a radical intermediate. The template ion exchange (TIE) method yields a catalyst with higher activity, whereas the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method provides better TBHP efficiency for epoxidation reactions. ESR, XANES, UVVIS, and UVRaman spectroscopies were utilized to characterize the manganese species in the MCM-41 samples. XPS analysis confirmed the coexistence of Mn2+ and Mn3+ in the catalysts prepared by both methods, with a portion of manganese atoms possibly incorporated into the MCM-41 framework via the DHT process.
