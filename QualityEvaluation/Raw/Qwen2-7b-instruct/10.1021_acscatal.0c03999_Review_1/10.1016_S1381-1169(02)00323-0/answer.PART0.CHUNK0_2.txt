[1] "Mn-MCM-41 was found to be the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using TBPH as an oxidant among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe- and Mo-containing MCM-41."
[2] "The oxidation of either styrene or stilbene with TBHP as the oxidant over the Mn-MCM-41 produces corresponding epoxide as the main product; the reaction probably proceeds through a radical intermediate."
[3] "The TIE catalyst shows higher activity, while the DHT catalyst gives higher TBHP efficiency for the epoxidation reactions."
[4] "Manganese complexes are well known catalysts for epoxidation reactions [13]."
[5] "The results suggest that Mn2+ and Mn3+ coexist in the Mn-MCM-41 samples synthesized by both methods and a large part of manganese atoms could be incorporated into the framework of MCM-41 obtained by the DHT method."
[6] "The oxidation of both styrene and stilbene using TBHP as the oxidant afforded the corresponding epoxides."

1.Mn-MCM-41 was identified as the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) among Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe-, and Mo-containing MCM-41.
2.The epoxidation reaction likely proceeds through a radical intermediate.
3.Templated ion exchange (TIE) catalysts exhibit higher activity, while direct hydrothermal (DHT) catalysts offer higher TBHP efficiency.
4.Manganese complexes are recognized catalysts for epoxidation reactions.
5.Mn-MCM-41 samples synthesized by both methods contain both Mn2+ and Mn3+, with some manganese atoms integrated into the MCM-41 framework via the DHT method.
6.Both styrene and stilbene are effectively epoxidized using TBHP as the oxidant.

1.在锰、钒、铬、铁和钼负载的MCM-41中，Mn-MCM-41被发现是使用叔丁基过氧化氢（TBHP）作为氧化剂进行苯乙烯氧化反应的最佳催化剂。
2.氧化反应可能通过自由基中间体进行。
3.模板离子交换（TIE）催化剂表现出更高的活性，而直接水热合成（DHT）催化剂提供更高的TBHP效率。
4.已知锰配合物是氧化反应的催化剂。
5.两种方法制备的Mn-MCM-41样品中都存在Mn2+和Mn3+，并且部分锰原子通过DHT方法整合到MCM-41骨架中。
6.无论是否为对映体，苯乙烯和间笨二酚均能有效被TBHP氧化生成环氧产物。
