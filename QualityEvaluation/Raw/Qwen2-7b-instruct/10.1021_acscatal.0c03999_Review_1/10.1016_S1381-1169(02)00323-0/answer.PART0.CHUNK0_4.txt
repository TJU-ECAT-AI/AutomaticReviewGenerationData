[1] "Manganese-containing MCM-41 is found to be the most effective heterogeneous catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) among several metal ion-containing mesoporous molecular sieves including Mn-, V-, Cr-, Fe-, and Mo-MCM-41."
[2] "The oxidation of either styrene or stilbene with TBHP as the oxidant over the Mn-MCM-41 produces corresponding epoxide as the main product; the reaction probably proceeds through a radical intermediate."
[3] "The TIE catalyst shows higher activity, while the DHT catalyst gives higher TBHP efficiency for the epoxidation reactions."
[4] "Manganese complexes are well known catalysts for epoxidation reactions."
[5] "The DHT samples showed a clear decrease in the peak intensity with an increase in Mn content, indicating a serious decrease in the structural regularity."
[6] "ESR spectroscopy was employed to survey the oxidation states of Mn species introduced to MCM-41."

The study reveals that manganese-containing MCM-41 is the most effective catalyst for the epoxidation of styrene with tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP). This process likely involves a radical intermediate. The template ion exchange (TIE) method yields a catalyst with higher activity, whereas the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method provides better TBHP efficiency for epoxidation reactions. ESR, XANES, UVVIS, and UVRaman spectroscopies were utilized to characterize the manganese species in the MCM-41 samples. XPS analysis confirmed the coexistence of Mn2+ and Mn3+ in the catalysts prepared by both methods, with a portion of manganese atoms possibly incorporated into the MCM-41 framework via the DHT process.

研究发现，含锰MCM-41是用叔丁基过氧化氢（TBHP）对苯乙烯进行环氧化反应中最有效的催化剂。该过程可能涉及一种自由基中间体。模板离子交换（TIE）方法得到的催化剂活性更高，而直接水热合成（DHT）方法则提供了更好的TBHP效率。使用ESR、XANES、UVVIS和UVRaman光谱法来表征MCM-41样品中的锰物种。XPS分析证实了两种方法制备的催化剂中存在Mn2+和Mn3+，部分锰离子可能通过DHT过程被整合到MCM-41的骨架中。
