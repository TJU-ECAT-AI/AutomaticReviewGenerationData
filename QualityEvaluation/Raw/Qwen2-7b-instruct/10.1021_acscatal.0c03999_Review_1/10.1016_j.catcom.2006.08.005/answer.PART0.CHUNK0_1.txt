Mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalyst: Characterization and excellent performance in dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide Licheng Liu a,b, Huiquan Li a,*, Yi Zhang a a Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, P.O. Box 353, Beijing 100080, PR China b Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, PR China Received 27 April 2006; received in revised form 4 August 2006; accepted 4 August 2006 Available online 12 August 2006 Abstract Nonordered mesoporous molecular sieves MSU-x supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) were prepared and characterized with X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UVvis, and H2-temperature programmed reduction techniques. Excellent results in dehydrogena- tion of propane to propylene with carbon dioxide (CO2) over Cr/MSU-x, 36.8% of propane conversion with 89.1% of propylene selec- tivity, were obtained. Lower Cr loading results in formation of Cr species with higher oxidation state, whereas higher Cr loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystal on catalyst surface. The active sites of the catalysts and the promoting effect of mesoporous MSU-x as support were also discussed. 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Propylene is one of the important and basic chemicals used in industrial processes, such as synthesis of polypro- pylene, crylic acid, acrylonitrile, and cumene. Recently,the demand for propylene has increased significantly; how- ever, to this day, most propylene (>90%) is produced as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes in refinery in industries worldwide. Many efforts have been made to catalyze oxidehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using oxygen; unfortunately, no break- through has been made [14]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages. First, thermody- namic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 !

CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxi- dant. Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this reaction [511].

Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparal- leled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels,are expected to be new promising catalyst support [12]. In this paper, mesoporous silica supported chromium catalyst was prepared and designated as Cr/MSU-x. MSU-x is an important family of mesoporous material, which holds 3D wormlike channels favoring diffusion of molecular objects [13]. Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study [14]. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2.

This document discusses the development and characterization of mesoporous silica-supported chromium catalysts (Cr/MSU-x) for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene using carbon dioxide as an oxidant. The study found that these catalysts exhibit excellent performance in this reaction, achieving a propane conversion of 36.8% with a propylene selectivity of 89.1%. The formation of chromium species with higher oxidation states is noted upon lower chromium loading, while higher loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystals on the catalyst surface. The document also highlights the role of the mesoporous MSU-x support in promoting the catalytic activity of the chromium-based catalysts.
