1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on mesoporous molecular sieves (MSU-x), display differing activities and selectivities in CO2-olefin production via hydrocarbon dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP). Key factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the metal oxide species formed, which evolves with changes in loading and support properties. As the chromium loading increases, the formation of chromium species with higher oxidation states occurs, whereas higher loading leads to the formation of bulk chromium oxide crystals on the catalyst surface.

2. The comparison of different catalysts in CO2-ODHP reveals that chromium oxide supported on mesoporous molecular sieves (Cr/MSU-x) exhibit superior performance compared to other catalysts mentioned in the literature, particularly in terms of propane conversion rates. This is attributed to the unique properties of the Cr/MSU-x system, including its high surface area, uniform nanoporous channels, and the ability to maintain meso-structure after loading chromium oxide. The optimized chromium loading range is found to maximize the conversion and yield of propylene.

3. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is crucial for understanding their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP. Lower chromium loading results in the formation of chromium species with higher oxidation states, which are more active for the desired reaction. Conversely, higher chromium loading leads to the formation of bulk chromium oxide crystals, which may not be as effective due to their less accessible active sites. The support material, in this case, MSU-x, plays a significant role in maintaining the active sites and enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是支持在有序介孔分子筛（MSU-x）上的铬氧化物（Cr2O3），在二氧化碳与烯烃生产（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性存在差异。影响催化性能的关键因素包括形成的金属氧化物种的性质，这些性质随着负载和支撑性质的变化而变化。随着铬负载量的增加，形成更高氧化状态的铬物种，而更高的负载导致表面铬氧化物晶体在催化剂表面上形成。 

2. 不同催化剂在CO2-ODHP的比较显示，支持在有序介孔分子筛（Cr/MSU-x）上的铬氧化物表现出与文献中列出的大多数催化剂相比更高的丙烷转化率的性能。这归因于Cr/MSU-x系统独特的性质，包括其高比表面积、均匀的纳米级孔道以及在加载铬氧化物后保持介观结构的能力。优化的铬负载范围被发现可以最大化丙烷转化率和丙烯产量。

3. 支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演化作为负载和支撑性质的功能对于理解其在CO2-ODHP中的催化性能至关重要。较低的铬负载导致形成更高氧化状态的铬物种，这些物种对于所需反应更为活跃。相反，较高的铬负载导致形成大量铬氧化物晶体，可能由于其可访问的活性位点较少，因此效率较低。在这种情况下，支持材料MSU-x对保持活性位点并增强整体催化效率起着重要作用。
