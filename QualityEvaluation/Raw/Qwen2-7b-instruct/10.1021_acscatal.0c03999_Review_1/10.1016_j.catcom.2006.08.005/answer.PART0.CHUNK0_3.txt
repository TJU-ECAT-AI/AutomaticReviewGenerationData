1. Various metal oxide catalysts, including chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on mesoporous molecular sieves (MSU-x), were compared for their activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP (Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Carbon Dioxide). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance included the evolution of chromium species in the supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties.

2. The Cr/MSU-x catalyst showed good activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2, as previously studied. This indicates its potential for similar reactions, including the dehydrogenation of propane.

3. Methane was identified as a significant byproduct in the dehydrogenation process, accounting for 5.9% to 5.5% of the total yield, which was generated through hydrocracking reactions.

4. The catalytic activities of Cr/MSU-x varied with chromium loading. Up to 5 wt% Cr2O3, both propane conversion and CO2 conversion increased, leading to an elevation in propylene yield. However, beyond 5 wt%, the selectivity for propylene began to decline, with maximum performance achieved at around 5 wt% to 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading.

5. Compared to other catalysts mentioned in the literature, the Cr/MSU-x catalyst demonstrated relatively higher propane conversion rates.

6. Over time, the conversion of propane and CO2 by the 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x catalyst gradually decreased, indicating a decline in catalytic activity with prolonged reaction duration.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括支持在介孔分子筛（MSU-x）上的铬氧化物（Cr2O3），被比较用于CO2-ODHP（碳二氧氧化脱氢反应）。影响其催化性能的关键因素包括支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变，作为负载和支撑性质的函数。

2. Cr/MSU-x 催化剂在与CO2的乙烷氧化脱氢过程中显示出良好的活性，这在之前的研究中已经被证明。这表明它可能适用于类似反应，包括丙烷脱氢。

3. 在脱氢过程中，甲烷被识别为一个重要的副产品，占总产率的5.9%至5.5%，通过裂解反应产生。

4. Cr/MSU-x 催化剂的催化活性随铬负载变化。在5 wt% Cr2O3以下，丙烷转化率和CO2转化率增加，导致丙烯产量的提升。然而，超过5 wt%，丙烯选择性开始下降，最佳性能在约5 wt%到12 wt% Cr2O3负载之间实现。

5. 与其他文献中提到的催化剂相比，Cr/MSU-x 催化剂显示了相对较高的丙烷转化率。

6. 随着反应时间的延长，5 wt% Cr/MSU-x 催化剂对丙烷和CO2的转化率逐渐降低，表明催化活性随反应时间的延长而衰减。
