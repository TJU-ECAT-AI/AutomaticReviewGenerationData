1. Various metal oxide catalysts, including chromium supported on mesoporous silica (Cr/MSU-x), demonstrate different activities and selectivities in CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance are related to the nature of the metal species formed, which depends on the loading of the metal oxide. Higher chromium loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystals on the catalyst surface, while lower chromium loading results in chromium species with higher oxidation states. The structure and properties of the support, such as its mesoporous nature, also play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. In the context of the provided document, the Cr/MSU-x catalysts show relatively higher propane conversion compared to other catalysts listed in Table 2. This is attributed to the unique properties of the mesoporous silica support, which helps in preserving the mesostructure even after loading with chromium oxide. The presence of uniform mesoporous channels within the support material facilitates better diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. As depicted in Figure 3, the catalytic activities of the 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x catalyst vary with reaction time. The conversion of propane and CO2 decreases gradually, indicating the gradual consumption of reactants over time during the catalytic process. This observation suggests that the catalyst's efficiency might diminish with prolonged exposure to the reaction conditions, potentially due to the formation of inactive species or deactivation of active sites.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括铬负载在介孔二氧化硅（Cr/MSU-x）上，在二氧化碳脱氢产丙烯（CO2-ODHP）过程中表现出不同的活性和选择性。影响其催化性能的关键因素是金属物种的性质，这取决于金属氧化物的负载量。较高的铬负载导致表面形成块状铬氧化物（Cr2O3）晶体，而较低的铬负载则导致具有更高氧化状态的铬物种。支持结构的特性，如其介孔性质，对于确定催化活性和选择性也起着关键作用。介孔结构内的支持材料有助于更好地扩散反应物和产物，从而增强催化性能。

2. 根据提供的文档，Cr/MSU-x 催化剂在丙烷脱氢产丙烯与二氧化碳反应中的相对较高的丙烷转化率。这归因于介孔二氧化硅支持的独特性质，它有助于在加载铬氧化物后保留介孔结构。介孔通道的存在有助于更好的反应物和产物扩散，从而提高催化性能。

3. 如图3所示，5 wt% Cr/MSU-x 催化剂的催化活性随反应时间变化。丙烷和二氧化碳的转化率逐渐降低，表明在催化过程中反应物逐渐消耗。这一观察结果表明，催化剂的效率可能随着暴露于反应条件的时间延长而降低，可能是由于形成非活性物种或活性位点失活。
