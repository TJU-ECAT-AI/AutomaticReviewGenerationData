1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the important and basic chemicals used in industrial processes, such as synthesis of polypro- pylene, crylic acid, acrylonitrile, and cumene. Recently,the demand for propylene has increased significantly; how- ever, to this day, most propylene (>90%) is produced as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes in refinery in industries worldwide. Many efforts have been made to catalyze oxidehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using oxygen; unfortunately, no break- through has been made [14]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages. First, thermody- namic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 !
CO + H2O); second, deep oxidation that occurred as a result of using oxygen as oxidant is avoided; third, it realizes the recycling of greenhouse gas CO2 when used as a soft oxi- dant. Many researchers have investigated the dehydrogena- tion of propane in the presence of CO2, suggesting that chromium and gallium oxide are active components for this reaction [511].

Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparal- leled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels,are expected to be new promising catalyst support [12]. In this paper, mesoporous silica supported chromium catalyst was prepared and designated as Cr/MSU-x. MSU-x is an important family of mesoporous material, which holds 3D wormlike channels favoring diffusion of molecular objects [13]. Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study [14]. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
The MSU-x support was synthesized as follows: 110 g/L Na2SiO3  9H2O aqueous solution was mixed with 0.1 mol/ L fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (A(EO)9) aqueous solution with molar ratio 1Si:0.1 A(EO)9 under vigorous stirring. The silicate polycondensation to a white precipi- tate occurred by adding 1 mol/L aqueous HCl to adjust pH value of the mixed solution from 1213 to 23. After being stirred for 24 h, the resulting solid gel was separated by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 C overnight. The as-synthesized MSU-x was calcined under static air at 600 C for 4 h to remove template. The calcined MSU-x was impregnated with desired Cr(NO3)3 aqueous solution to prepare Cr/MSU-x catalysts. Cr/ MSU-x catalyst was also calcined at 600 C for 4 h before reaction. Four catalysts with different Cr loading (calcu- lated by Cr2O3) of 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 12 wt%, and 20 wt%,respectively, were prepared.

2.2. Characterizations
The reaction of CO2 and C3H8 was performed at atmo- spheric pressure in a fixed bed quartz reactor (5.0 mm i.d.,
44.0 cm long). The reactants consisted of V(CO2) = 9 ml/
min and V(C3H8) = 3 ml/min. Catalyst loading was 0.2 g.
The products were analyzed online by a gas chromatograph equipped with paropark-QS column (3 m, U1/4) and a ther- mal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC 14B). The pro- pane conversion and products selectivity were calculated based on Eqs. (1) and (2) [6]. The conversion of propane to coke was neglected because the instantaneous formation of coke is time dependent and difficult to estimate.

and step time 5.08 s for regions at 1090. Diffuse reflec- tance UVvis spectroscopic measurements were recorded on a UV2100 spectrometer. The spectra were collected at 230700 nm referenced to BaSO4. H2-TPR of catalysts was performed on CHEMBET3000 chemical adsorption apparatus from Quantachrome by using a mixture of 5 vol% H2/Ar as reducing gas with a total flow rate 20 ml/min. A 50 mg sample was heated from room temper- ature to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min after pre- treatment at 300 C for 30 min in helium gas flow. The reduction signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The reducing gas was cooled by mixture of n-octane and liquid nitrogen to condense the water gen- erated from reduction of the catalyst.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Meso-structure and activities of catalysts
The blank MSU-x gives one broad peak at low angle region corresponding to d1 0 0 reflection in XRD pattern (Fig.1a), indicating that the presence of uniform mesopor- ous channels [15]. Chromium supported Cr/MSU-x show one similar
XRD
peak as blank MSU-x at about 2h = 2. Moreover, the surface area and pore diameter of blank MSU-x and 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x that have been mea- sured though N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms as
963.6, 964.6 m2/g and 2.57, 2.64 nm in our previous study
show no obvious difference [14]. These results suggest that meso-structure of MSU-x is preserved after loading of chromium oxide (Cr2O3). It is noticed that the reflection intensity of Cr/MSU-x reduces with the increasing of Cr2O3 loading (Fig. 1be). More Cr2O3 introduction into the material results in losing integrity and order of meso- structure. Similar result was observed on Co-MCM-41 by Li et al. [16].

The catalytic behaviors of 5 wt% Cr2O3/MSU-x in pro-pane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2 are shown in Table 1. Reaction network of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 is very complicated. However, due to the higher selectivity of C3H6 in product, the following reactions are considered as main reactions [5,6,11]:
C3H8 ! C3H6  H2
3
CO2  H2 ! CO  H2O

Propylene comes from two ways by reactions (3) and (5).
Several side reactions include reforming and hydrocracking of propane:
C3H8  3CO2 ! 6CO  4H2

2C3H8  H2 ! 3C2H6
7
C3H8  2H2 ! 3CH4
8 The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2 is similar as the results of propane and will not be discussed.

Conversion of propane increased as the reaction tempera- ture was raised, whereas selectivity of propylene, the object product, decreased. The main byproduct, methane, was generated from hydrocracking reaction (8) with selectivities of 5.99.5%. Ethane and ethylene are two other byproducts resulting from cracking or dehydrogenation reactions with selectivities of less than 5% always.

The catalytic activities of Cr/MSU-x that varied with Cr2O3 loading are shown in Fig. 2. The conversion of pro-pane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propyl- ene still acquire elevation. Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%. Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical cat- alysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, includ- ing catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/ MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction condi- tions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher pro- pane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table.

The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction. Fig. 3 exhibits the catalytic activities of 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x as a function of reaction time. Conver- sion of propane and CO2 decreased gradually with time

1. The study compares various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium (Cr)-loaded mesoporous silica-supported catalysts (Cr/MSU-x), in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the evolution of chromium species within the catalyst matrix as a function of chromium loading and support properties. At lower chromium loadings, the catalysts exhibit higher oxidation states of chromium species, which contribute to enhanced catalytic activity. However, at higher loadings, the formation of bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) on the catalyst surface occurs, potentially diminishing the active sites available for the reaction.

2. The Cr/MSU-x catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in the CO2-ODHP process, achieving a 36.8% conversion of propane with 89.1% selectivity for propylene. The results indicate that the mesoporous structure of the support (MSU-x) plays a significant role in promoting the reaction, possibly due to its ability to facilitate the diffusion of molecules and provide a suitable environment for active sites.

3. The synthesis of the MSU-x support involved a complex procedure that resulted in a material with a unique three-dimensional wormlike channel structure, conducive to molecular diffusion. This support was then loaded with chromium oxide (Cr2O3) to create the Cr/MSU-x catalysts, which showed improved activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 compared to other catalysts listed in the study.

4. The experimental section describes the detailed methodology for the preparation of the Cr/MSU-x catalysts, including the synthesis of the mesoporous silica support and the loading of chromium oxide. The characterization techniques used to evaluate the structure and active sites of the catalysts are X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, and H2-temperature programmed reduction.

5. The results and discussion highlight that the catalytic activity of the Cr/MSU-x catalysts increases with chromium loading until reaching around 5 wt%, beyond which the activity may start to decrease due to the formation of bulk Cr2O3. The maximum conversion of propane and propylene yield were observed between 5 wt% and 12 wt% chromium loading.

6. The comparison with other catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 reveals that the Cr/MSU-x catalysts exhibit higher propane conversion rates than most of the listed catalysts, demonstrating their relative effectiveness in the targeted reaction.

2. Cr/MSU-x 催化剂在CO2-ODHP过程中表现出优异的性能，实现了36.8%的丙烷转化率和89.1%的丙烯选择性。结果表明，支持材料（MSU-x）的独特介孔结构对促进反应起着重要作用，可能是由于其能够促进分子扩散并为活性位点提供适当环境。

3. MSU-x 支持材料的合成涉及一个复杂的过程，最终产生了一种具有独特三维蠕虫状通道结构的材料，有利于分子扩散。然后，通过将铬氧化物（Cr2O3）加载到该支持材料上，制成了Cr/MSU-x催化剂，这些催化剂在与CO2的丙烷脱氢反应中显示出与列出的其他催化剂相比更高的活性。

4. 实验部分详细描述了Cr/MSU-x催化剂的制备方法，包括介孔二氧化硅支持材料的合成和铬氧化物的负载。用于评估催化剂结构和活性位点的表征技术包括X射线衍射、漫反射紫外可见光谱和H2-温度程序还原。

5. 结果讨论指出，Cr/MSU-x催化剂的催化活性随着铬负载量增加至约5 wt%时达到峰值，之后可能会下降，因为在此阶段会形成大量Cr2O3。在5 wt%和12 wt%铬负载量之间观察到了最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

6. 与列出的其他催化剂在丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中的比较显示，Cr/MSU-x催化剂的丙烷转化率高于大多数催化剂，证明了它们在目标反应中的相对有效性。
