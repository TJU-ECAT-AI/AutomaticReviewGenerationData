1. Various metal oxide catalysts, including chromium supported on mesoporous silica (Cr/MSU-x), demonstrate different activities and selectivities in CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance are related to the nature of the metal species formed, which depends on the loading of the metal oxide. Higher chromium loading leads to bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) crystals on the catalyst surface, while lower chromium loading results in chromium species with higher oxidation states. The structure and properties of the support, such as its mesoporous nature, also play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity.

2. In the context of the provided document, the Cr/MSU-x catalysts show relatively higher propane conversion compared to other catalysts listed in Table 2. This is attributed to the unique properties of the mesoporous silica support, which helps in preserving the mesostructure even after loading with chromium oxide. The presence of uniform mesoporous channels within the support material facilitates better diffusion of reactants and products, enhancing the catalytic performance.

3. As depicted in Figure 3, the catalytic activities of the 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x catalyst vary with reaction time. The conversion of propane and CO2 decreases gradually, indicating the gradual consumption of reactants over time during the catalytic process. This observation suggests that the catalyst's efficiency might diminish with prolonged exposure to the reaction conditions, potentially due to the formation of inactive species or deactivation of active sites.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括铬负载在介孔二氧化硅（Cr/MSU-x）上，在二氧化碳脱氢产丙烯（CO2-ODHP）过程中表现出不同的活性和选择性。影响其催化性能的关键因素是金属物种的性质，这取决于金属氧化物的负载量。较高的铬负载导致表面形成块状铬氧化物（Cr2O3）晶体，而较低的铬负载则导致具有更高氧化状态的铬物种。支持结构的特性，如其介孔性质，对于确定催化活性和选择性也起着关键作用。介孔结构内的支持材料有助于更好地扩散反应物和产物，从而增强催化性能。

2. 根据提供的文档，Cr/MSU-x 催化剂在丙烷脱氢产丙烯与二氧化碳反应中的相对较高的丙烷转化率。这归因于介孔二氧化硅支持的独特性质，它有助于在加载铬氧化物后保留介孔结构。介孔通道的存在有助于更好的反应物和产物扩散，从而提高催化性能。

3. 如图3所示，5 wt% Cr/MSU-x 催化剂的催化活性随反应时间变化。丙烷和二氧化碳的转化率逐渐降低，表明在催化过程中反应物逐渐消耗。这一观察结果表明，催化剂的效率可能随着暴露于反应条件的时间延长而降低，可能是由于形成非活性物种或活性位点失活。

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the important and basic chemicals used in industrial processes, such as synthesis of polypro- pylene, crylic acid, acrylonitrile, and cumene. Recently,the demand for propylene has increased significantly; how- ever, to this day, most propylene (>90%) is produced as a byproduct from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes in refinery in industries worldwide. Many efforts have been made to catalyze oxidehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using oxygen; unfortunately, no break- through has been made [14]. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been thought to be a possible substitute for oxygen. The introduction of CO2 in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has many potential advantages. First, thermody- namic equilibrium limitation is overcome and propylene yield is improved by removal of hydrogen (CO2 + H2 !

Mesoporous silicate materials, which possess unparal- leled high surface area and uniform nanoporous channels,are expected to be new promising catalyst support [12]. In this paper, mesoporous silica supported chromium catalyst was prepared and designated as Cr/MSU-x. MSU-x is an important family of mesoporous material, which holds 3D wormlike channels favoring diffusion of molecular objects [13]. Cr/MSU-x catalyst exhibited good activity in the ODH of ethane with CO2 according to our previous study [14]. The catalysts exhibit excellent activity in the dehydro- genation of propane with CO2.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
The MSU-x support was synthesized as follows: 110 g/L Na2SiO3  9H2O aqueous solution was mixed with 0.1 mol/ L fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether (A(EO)9) aqueous solution with molar ratio 1Si:0.1 A(EO)9 under vigorous stirring. The silicate polycondensation to a white precipi- tate occurred by adding 1 mol/L aqueous HCl to adjust pH value of the mixed solution from 1213 to 23. After being stirred for 24 h, the resulting solid gel was separated by filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at 60 C overnight. The as-synthesized MSU-x was calcined under static air at 600 C for 4 h to remove template. The calcined MSU-x was impregnated with desired Cr(NO3)3 aqueous solution to prepare Cr/MSU-x catalysts. Cr/ MSU-x catalyst was also calcined at 600 C for 4 h before reaction. Four catalysts with different Cr loading (calcu- lated by Cr2O3) of 1 wt%, 5 wt%, 12 wt%, and 20 wt%,respectively, were prepared.

2.2. Characterizations
The reaction of CO2 and C3H8 was performed at atmo- spheric pressure in a fixed bed quartz reactor (5.0 mm i.d.,
44.0 cm long). The reactants consisted of V(CO2) = 9 ml/
min and V(C3H8) = 3 ml/min. Catalyst loading was 0.2 g.
The products were analyzed online by a gas chromatograph equipped with paropark-QS column (3 m, U1/4) and a ther- mal conductivity detector (Shimadzu GC 14B). The pro- pane conversion and products selectivity were calculated based on Eqs. (1) and (2) [6]. The conversion of propane to coke was neglected because the instantaneous formation of coke is time dependent and difficult to estimate.

10.075 s for regions at 0.56.0, scanning step size 0.017
and step time 5.08 s for regions at 1090. Diffuse reflec- tance UVvis spectroscopic measurements were recorded on a UV2100 spectrometer. The spectra were collected at 230700 nm referenced to BaSO4. H2-TPR of catalysts was performed on CHEMBET3000 chemical adsorption apparatus from Quantachrome by using a mixture of 5 vol% H2/Ar as reducing gas with a total flow rate 20 ml/min. A 50 mg sample was heated from room temper- ature to 700 C at a heating rate of 10 C/min after pre- treatment at 300 C for 30 min in helium gas flow. The reduction signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The reducing gas was cooled by mixture of n-octane and liquid nitrogen to condense the water gen- erated from reduction of the catalyst.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Meso-structure and activities of catalysts
The blank MSU-x gives one broad peak at low angle region corresponding to d1 0 0 reflection in XRD pattern (Fig.1a), indicating that the presence of uniform mesopor- ous channels [15]. Chromium supported Cr/MSU-x show one similar
XRD
peak as blank MSU-x at about 2h = 2. Moreover, the surface area and pore diameter of blank MSU-x and 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x that have been mea- sured though N2 adsorptiondesorption isotherms as
963.6, 964.6 m2/g and 2.57, 2.64 nm in our previous study
show no obvious difference [14]. These results suggest that meso-structure of MSU-x is preserved after loading of chromium oxide (Cr2O3). It is noticed that the reflection intensity of Cr/MSU-x reduces with the increasing of Cr2O3 loading (Fig. 1be). More Cr2O3 introduction into the material results in losing integrity and order of meso- structure. Similar result was observed on Co-MCM-41 by Li et al. [16].

The catalytic behaviors of 5 wt% Cr2O3/MSU-x in pro-pane dehydrogenation to propylene with CO2 are shown in Table 1. Reaction network of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 is very complicated. However, due to the higher selectivity of C3H6 in product, the following reactions are considered as main reactions [5,6,11]:
C3H8 ! C3H6  H2
3
CO2  H2 ! CO  H2O

Propylene comes from two ways by reactions (3) and (5).
Several side reactions include reforming and hydrocracking of propane:
C3H8  3CO2 ! 6CO  4H2

2C3H8  H2 ! 3C2H6
7
C3H8  2H2 ! 3CH4
8 The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene with CO2 is similar as the results of propane and will not be discussed.

Conversion of propane increased as the reaction tempera- ture was raised, whereas selectivity of propylene, the object product, decreased. The main byproduct, methane, was generated from hydrocracking reaction (8) with selectivities of 5.99.5%. Ethane and ethylene are two other byproducts resulting from cracking or dehydrogenation reactions with selectivities of less than 5% always.

The catalytic activities of Cr/MSU-x that varied with Cr2O3 loading are shown in Fig. 2. The conversion of pro-pane and CO2 both increase with Cr content in the catalyst before Cr2O3 loading reaches 5 wt%. Although selectivity to propylene shows decrease in this region, yield of propyl- ene still acquire elevation. Maximum propane conversions and propylene yield are obtained between 5 wt% and 12 wt% Cr2O3 loading and then drop slightly. Selectivity to propylene declines from 95.3% to a minimum of about 89%. Table 2 summarizes the activities of some typical cat- alysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, includ- ing catalysts cited from literatures and the 12 wt% Cr/ MSU-x prepared for this study. Although reaction condi- tions are different, Cr/MSU-x exhibit relative higher pro- pane conversion than most catalysts listed in the table.

The results show that Cr/MSU-x is a very active catalyst for this reaction. Fig. 3 exhibits the catalytic activities of 5 wt% Cr/MSU-x as a function of reaction time. Conver- sion of propane and CO2 decreased gradually with time

1. The study compares various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium (Cr)-loaded mesoporous silica-supported catalysts (Cr/MSU-x), in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the evolution of chromium species within the catalyst matrix as a function of chromium loading and support properties. At lower chromium loadings, the catalysts exhibit higher oxidation states of chromium species, which contribute to enhanced catalytic activity. However, at higher loadings, the formation of bulk chromium oxide (Cr2O3) on the catalyst surface occurs, potentially diminishing the active sites available for the reaction.

2. The Cr/MSU-x catalysts demonstrated excellent performance in the CO2-ODHP process, achieving a 36.8% conversion of propane with 89.1% selectivity for propylene. The results indicate that the mesoporous structure of the support (MSU-x) plays a significant role in promoting the reaction, possibly due to its ability to facilitate the diffusion of molecules and provide a suitable environment for active sites.

3. The synthesis of the MSU-x support involved a complex procedure that resulted in a material with a unique three-dimensional wormlike channel structure, conducive to molecular diffusion. This support was then loaded with chromium oxide (Cr2O3) to create the Cr/MSU-x catalysts, which showed improved activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 compared to other catalysts listed in the study.

4. The experimental section describes the detailed methodology for the preparation of the Cr/MSU-x catalysts, including the synthesis of the mesoporous silica support and the loading of chromium oxide. The characterization techniques used to evaluate the structure and active sites of the catalysts are X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, and H2-temperature programmed reduction.

5. The results and discussion highlight that the catalytic activity of the Cr/MSU-x catalysts increases with chromium loading until reaching around 5 wt%, beyond which the activity may start to decrease due to the formation of bulk Cr2O3. The maximum conversion of propane and propylene yield were observed between 5 wt% and 12 wt% chromium loading.

6. The comparison with other catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 reveals that the Cr/MSU-x catalysts exhibit higher propane conversion rates than most of the listed catalysts, demonstrating their relative effectiveness in the targeted reaction.

5. 结果讨论指出，Cr/MSU-x催化剂的催化活性随着铬负载量增加至约5 wt%时达到峰值，之后可能会下降，因为在此阶段会形成大量Cr2O3。在5 wt%和12 wt%铬负载量之间观察到了最高的丙烷转化率和丙烯产率。

6. 与列出的其他催化剂在丙烷与CO2的脱氢反应中的比较显示，Cr/MSU-x催化剂的丙烷转化率高于大多数催化剂，证明了它们在目标反应中的相对有效性。

Key factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the metal oxide species formed, which evolves with changes in loading and support properties. As the chromium loading increases, the formation of chromium species with higher oxidation states occurs, whereas higher loading leads to the formation of bulk chromium oxide crystals on the catalyst surface.

2. The comparison of different catalysts in CO2-ODHP reveals that chromium oxide supported on mesoporous molecular sieves (Cr/MSU-x) exhibit superior performance compared to other catalysts mentioned in the literature, particularly in terms of propane conversion rates. This is attributed to the unique properties of the Cr/MSU-x system, including its high surface area, uniform nanoporous channels, and the ability to maintain meso-structure after loading chromium oxide. The optimized chromium loading range is found to maximize the conversion and yield of propylene.

3. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is crucial for understanding their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP. Lower chromium loading results in the formation of chromium species with higher oxidation states, which are more active for the desired reaction. Conversely, higher chromium loading leads to the formation of bulk chromium oxide crystals, which may not be as effective due to their less accessible active sites. The support material, in this case, MSU-x, plays a significant role in maintaining the active sites and enhancing the overall catalytic efficiency.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是支持在有序介孔分子筛（MSU-x）上的铬氧化物（Cr2O3），在二氧化碳与烯烃生产（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性存在差异。影响催化性能的关键因素包括形成的金属氧化物种的性质，这些性质随着负载和支撑性质的变化而变化。随着铬负载量的增加，形成更高氧化状态的铬物种，而更高的负载导致表面铬氧化物晶体在催化剂表面上形成。 

2. 不同催化剂在CO2-ODHP的比较显示，支持在有序介孔分子筛（Cr/MSU-x）上的铬氧化物表现出与文献中列出的大多数催化剂相比更高的丙烷转化率的性能。这归因于Cr/MSU-x系统独特的性质，包括其高比表面积、均匀的纳米级孔道以及在加载铬氧化物后保持介观结构的能力。优化的铬负载范围被发现可以最大化丙烷转化率和丙烯产量。

3. 支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演化作为负载和支撑性质的功能对于理解其在CO2-ODHP中的催化性能至关重要。较低的铬负载导致形成更高氧化状态的铬物种，这些物种对于所需反应更为活跃。相反，较高的铬负载导致形成大量铬氧化物晶体，可能由于其可访问的活性位点较少，因此效率较低。在这种情况下，支持材料MSU-x对保持活性位点并增强整体催化效率起着重要作用。
