          [1] "Hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 as a novel efficient catalyst for dehy- drogenation of propane with CO2"
          [2] "The catalyst was characterized by XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption"
          [3] "The results showed that the as-prepared catalyst had high activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP"
          [4] "The activity and selectivity of the catalyst were found to depend on the loading of Cr2O3 and the properties of the support ZrO2"
          [5] "The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was studied as a function of loading and support properties"

          The hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The catalyst's performance is influenced by its characterization through XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. High activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP were observed, which depends on the loading of Cr2O3 and the properties of the support ZrO2. The evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalyst was studied as a function of loading and support properties, contributing to its catalytic performance.
