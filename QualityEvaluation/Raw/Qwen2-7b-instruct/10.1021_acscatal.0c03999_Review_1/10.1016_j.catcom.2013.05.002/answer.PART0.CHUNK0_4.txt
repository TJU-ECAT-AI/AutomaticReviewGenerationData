1. Hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 is an efficient catalyst for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The catalyst's activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP depend on the loading of Cr2O3 and the properties of the support ZrO2.
2. The catalyst was characterized through XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. The characterization revealed that the catalyst exhibits high activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP.
3. The evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalyst was studied based on its loading and support properties, contributing to its catalytic performance.
