[1] "The hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 catalyst was evaluated for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."
[2] "The results indicated that the catalyst showed high activity and selectivity for the reaction."
[3] "The key factors influencing the catalytic performance were found to be the metal oxide composition and the support properties."
[4] "In particular, the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was observed to depend on the loading and support properties."

The hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The catalytic performance was influenced by the metal oxide composition and support properties, with the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts being dependent on the loading and support characteristics.
