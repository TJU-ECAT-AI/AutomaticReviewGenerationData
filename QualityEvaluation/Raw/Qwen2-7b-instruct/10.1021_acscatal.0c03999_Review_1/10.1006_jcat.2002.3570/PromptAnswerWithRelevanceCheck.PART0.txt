[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
[3] "The ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[4] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is much lower than that for alkane dehydrogenation (E1) and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing surface density."

The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for both reactions are similar and not significantly affected by vanadia surface density. The ratio of alkane combustion to oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies (k2/k1) is relatively constant with reaction temperature for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures at low surface densities are more selective for alkane dehydrogenation. The activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is lower than for alkane dehydrogenation (E1), and this difference decreases with increasing vanadia surface density.

对于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢，研究了Al2O3支持的二氧化钒的各种VOx表面密度（1.434.2 V/nm2）和结构的催化性能。丙烯形成速率相对于乙烯形成速率在给定反应温度下大约高八倍，但两个反应物的显式ODH活化能（E1）相似且对二氧化钒表面密度影响不大。烷烃燃烧与ODH反应的活化能比（k2/k1）随反应温度变化很小，对于乙烷而言，但随着二氧化钒表面密度的增加而略微增加，这表明在低表面密度下占主导的孤立结构对烷烃脱氢反应的选择性更高。烯烃燃烧的活化能（E3）低于烷烃脱氢的活化能（E1），并且这种差异随二氧化钒表面密度的增加而减小。

The document discusses the catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The activation energies for dehydrogenation (E1) are similar for both reactants, while the propene formation rates are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature. The ratio of k2/k1, related to alkane combustion and dehydrogenation, depends weakly on reaction temperature but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting more selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is achieved on catalysts with predominantly isolated monovanadate species, operated at high temperatures to avoid homogeneous reactions. The document also notes that the apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in the difference between E1 and E3 with increasing surface density. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and decreasing vanadia surface density.

The study investigates the catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with varying vanadia oxide surface density for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The research reveals that the formation rates of propene are approximately eight times higher than ethene at the same reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for both reactants are similar and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the alkane combustion rate constant to the oxidative dehydrogenation rate constant (k2/k1) is weakly dependent on reaction temperature, indicating that the activation energies for alkane combustion and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are comparable. For propane, the ratio of k2/k1 increases slightly with increasing vanadia surface density, suggesting that isolated structures at lower densities are more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The ratio of the alkene combustion rate constant to the oxidative dehydrogenation rate constant (k3/k1) decreases significantly with increasing reaction temperature, showing that the apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is much lower than that for alkane dehydrogenation (E1), and this difference decreases with increasing vanadia surface density.

该研究探讨了不同范德瓦亚氧化物表面密度的氧化铝支持范德瓦亚在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢化中的催化性质。研究表明，丙烯的生成速率大约是乙烯的八倍，在相同的反应温度下，但两个反应物的显着脱氢化激活能（E1）相似且对范德瓦亚表面密度相对不敏感。对于烷烃燃烧率常数与氧化脱氢化率常数（k2/k1）的比值随反应温度变化较弱，表明烷烃燃烧和氧化脱氢化反应的激活能相近。对于丙烷，k2/k1的比值随着范德瓦亚表面密度的增加而略有增加，这表明较低密度下存在的孤立结构对于烷烃脱氢化反应更为选择性。对于烷基燃烧率常数与氧化脱氢化率常数（k3/k1）的比值随反应温度升高而显著降低，显示烷基燃烧的显着激活能（E3）远低于烷烃脱氢化（E1），这一差异随范德瓦亚表面密度的增加而减小。

The study examines the catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The research finds that as the vanadia surface density increases, two-dimensional polyvanadates form along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Propene formation rates are significantly higher than ethene formation rates at the same reaction temperature, yet the apparent activation energies for both reactants are similar and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of k2/k1, representing alkane combustion to ODH reactions, is weakly dependent on reaction temperature but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. This indicates that isolated structures prevalent at lower surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion is notably lower than for alkane dehydrogenation, and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing vanadia surface density.

该研究考察了氧化脱氢化乙烷和丙烷时，不同范德瓦表面密度（1.434.2 V/nm2）和结构的氧化铝支持钒的催化性能。研究发现，随着钒表面密度的增加，二维聚钒形成，并且在表面密度超过7.0 V/nm2时出现更多的V2O5晶粒。在相同反应温度下，丙烯生成速率是乙烯生成速率的大约八倍，但是两种反应物的显式脱氢化激活能（E1）相似且对钒表面密度相对不敏感。k2/k1比率，代表烷烃燃烧与脱氢反应之间的比率，随着反应温度的变化而变化很小，但对丙烷而言，随着钒表面密度的增加略有上升。这表明，在较低表面密度时存在的孤立结构对于烷烃脱氢反应略微更具有选择性。烷基酮燃烧的显式激活能远低于烷烃脱氢化，两者之间的差异随钒表面密度的增加而减小。
