[1] "UVvisible and Raman spectra showed that vanadia is dispersed predominately as isolated monovanadate species below 2.3 V/nm2."
[2] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates form via reactions leading to VOV bonds connecting neighboring VOx species."
[3] "For both ethane and propane reactants, these apparent turnover rates reach a maximum at intermediate vanadia surface densities."
[4] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[5] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of reaction temperature, but increases with increasing vanadia surface density for propane ODH."
[6] "The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, E1, and ethane and propane combustion, E2, are similar in magnitude at 115 ± 20 kJ/mol and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density."

1. Vanadia is dispersed as isolated monovanadate species at low surface densities, and as two-dimensional polyvanadates at higher densities.
2. The maximum rate of alkene formation occurs at intermediate vanadia surface densities for both ethane and propane reactants.
3. The ratio of k2/k1 for alkane combustion and ODH reactions remains constant regardless of temperature.
4. The ratio of k2/k1 for propane ODH increases with increasing vanadia surface density.
5. The activation energies for ethane and propane ODH, as well as combustion, are similar and show weak dependence on vanadia surface density.
