[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
[3] "The ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[4] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "The ratio of k3/k1 decreases markedly with increasing reaction temperature for both ethane and propane ODH. Thus, the apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is much lower than that for alkane dehydrogenation (E1) and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing surface density."

The study investigates the catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia with varying vanadia oxide surface density for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The research reveals that the formation rates of propene are approximately eight times higher than ethene at the same reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for both reactants are similar and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of the alkane combustion rate constant to the oxidative dehydrogenation rate constant (k2/k1) is weakly dependent on reaction temperature, indicating that the activation energies for alkane combustion and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are comparable. For propane, the ratio of k2/k1 increases slightly with increasing vanadia surface density, suggesting that isolated structures at lower densities are more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The ratio of the alkene combustion rate constant to the oxidative dehydrogenation rate constant (k3/k1) decreases significantly with increasing reaction temperature, showing that the apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is much lower than that for alkane dehydrogenation (E1), and this difference decreases with increasing vanadia surface density.

该研究探讨了不同范德瓦亚氧化物表面密度的氧化铝支持范德瓦亚在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢化中的催化性质。研究表明，丙烯的生成速率大约是乙烯的八倍，在相同的反应温度下，但两个反应物的显着脱氢化激活能（E1）相似且对范德瓦亚表面密度相对不敏感。对于烷烃燃烧率常数与氧化脱氢化率常数（k2/k1）的比值随反应温度变化较弱，表明烷烃燃烧和氧化脱氢化反应的激活能相近。对于丙烷，k2/k1的比值随着范德瓦亚表面密度的增加而略有增加，这表明较低密度下存在的孤立结构对于烷烃脱氢化反应更为选择性。对于烷基燃烧率常数与氧化脱氢化率常数（k3/k1）的比值随反应温度升高而显著降低，显示烷基燃烧的显着激活能（E3）远低于烷烃脱氢化（E1），这一差异随范德瓦亚表面密度的增加而减小。
