[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[2] "As V surface densities increase, two-dimensional polyvanadates appear (2.37.0 V/nm2), along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites at surface densities above 7.0 V/nm2."
[3] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
[4] "The ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[5] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[6] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is much lower than that for alkane dehydrogenation (E1) and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing surface density."

The study examines the catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadia for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The research finds that as the vanadia surface density increases, two-dimensional polyvanadates form along with increasing amounts of V2O5 crystallites. Propene formation rates are significantly higher than ethene formation rates at the same reaction temperature, yet the apparent activation energies for both reactants are similar and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density. The ratio of k2/k1, representing alkane combustion to ODH reactions, is weakly dependent on reaction temperature but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane. This indicates that isolated structures prevalent at lower surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation. The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion is notably lower than for alkane dehydrogenation, and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing vanadia surface density.

该研究考察了氧化脱氢化乙烷和丙烷时，不同范德瓦表面密度（1.434.2 V/nm2）和结构的氧化铝支持钒的催化性能。研究发现，随着钒表面密度的增加，二维聚钒形成，并且在表面密度超过7.0 V/nm2时出现更多的V2O5晶粒。在相同反应温度下，丙烯生成速率是乙烯生成速率的大约八倍，但是两种反应物的显式脱氢化激活能（E1）相似且对钒表面密度相对不敏感。k2/k1比率，代表烷烃燃烧与脱氢反应之间的比率，随着反应温度的变化而变化很小，但对丙烷而言，随着钒表面密度的增加略有上升。这表明，在较低表面密度时存在的孤立结构对于烷烃脱氢反应略微更具有选择性。烷基酮燃烧的显式激活能远低于烷烃脱氢化，两者之间的差异随钒表面密度的增加而减小。
