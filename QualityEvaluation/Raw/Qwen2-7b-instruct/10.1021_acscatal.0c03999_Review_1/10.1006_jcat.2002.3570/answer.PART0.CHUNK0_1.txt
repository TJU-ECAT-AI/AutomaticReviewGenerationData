[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
[3] "The ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[4] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "The highest yield of alkene is obtained for catalysts containing predominantly isolated monovanadate species and operated at high temperatures that avoid homogeneous reactions (<800 K)."

The document discusses the catalytic properties of alumina-supported vanadium oxide for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. The activation energies for dehydrogenation (E1) are similar for both reactants, while the propene formation rates are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature. The ratio of k2/k1, related to alkane combustion and dehydrogenation, depends weakly on reaction temperature but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting more selectivity for alkane dehydrogenation. The highest yield of alkene is achieved on catalysts with predominantly isolated monovanadate species, operated at high temperatures to avoid homogeneous reactions. The document also notes that the apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) increases with vanadia surface density, leading to a decrease in the difference between E1 and E3 with increasing surface density. Alkene selectivity generally increases with increasing reaction temperature and decreasing vanadia surface density.

本文讨论了氧化铝支持的钒氧化物在乙烷和丙烷氧化脱氢中的催化性质。脱氢的活化能（E1）对于两种反应物是相似的，而丙烯生成速率相对于乙烯生成速率大约是八倍，在给定反应温度下。k2/k1的比例，与烷烃燃烧和脱氢反应有关，仅在较低反应温度下依赖性较弱，但在丙烷中略有增加，这表明在较低表面密度下存在的孤立结构对于烷烃脱氢反应更具选择性。获得最高丙烯产率的最佳催化剂含有主要由孤立的单钒酸盐物种组成的，并且在避免均相反应的高温下操作（<800 K）。文档还指出，随着钒表面密度的增加，乙烯燃烧的显着激活能（E3）增加，导致E1和E3之间的差异随表面密度增加而减少。随着反应温度的升高和钒表面密度的降低，烯烃选择性通常会增加。
