[1] "The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia with a wide range of VOx surface density (1.434.2 V/nm2) and structure were examined for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane."
[2] "Propene formation rates (per V atom) are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent ODH activation energies (E1) are similar for the two reactants and relatively insensitive to vanadia surface density."
[3] "The ratio of k2/k1 depends weakly on reaction temperature, indicating that activation energies for alkane combustion and ODH reactions are similar."
[4] "The ratio of k2/k1 is independent of surface density for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures prevalent at low surface densities are slightly more selective for alkane dehydrogenation reactions."
[5] "The apparent activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is much lower than that for alkane dehydrogenation (E1) and the difference between these two activation energies decreases with increasing surface density."

The catalytic properties of Al2O3-supported vanadia were studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Propene formation rates are approximately eight times higher than ethene formation rates at a given reaction temperature, but the apparent activation energies for both reactions are similar and not significantly affected by vanadia surface density. The ratio of alkane combustion to oxidative dehydrogenation activation energies (k2/k1) is relatively constant with reaction temperature for ethane but increases slightly with vanadia surface density for propane, suggesting that isolated structures at low surface densities are more selective for alkane dehydrogenation. The activation energy for alkene combustion (E3) is lower than for alkane dehydrogenation (E1), and this difference decreases with increasing vanadia surface density.

对于乙烷和丙烷的氧化脱氢，研究了Al2O3支持的二氧化钒的各种VOx表面密度（1.434.2 V/nm2）和结构的催化性能。丙烯形成速率相对于乙烯形成速率在给定反应温度下大约高八倍，但两个反应物的显式ODH活化能（E1）相似且对二氧化钒表面密度影响不大。烷烃燃烧与ODH反应的活化能比（k2/k1）随反应温度变化很小，对于乙烷而言，但随着二氧化钒表面密度的增加而略微增加，这表明在低表面密度下占主导的孤立结构对烷烃脱氢反应的选择性更高。烯烃燃烧的活化能（E3）低于烷烃脱氢的活化能（E1），并且这种差异随二氧化钒表面密度的增加而减小。
