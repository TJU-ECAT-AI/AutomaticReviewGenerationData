<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding uia carbeniumion intermediates.</p>
<p>In addition, the unique pore system of this type of zeolite hinders the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules [l], thus preventing the socalled coke deposition, which normally causes a rapid deactivation of acid catalysts.</p>
<p>Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range [Z].</p>
<p>The reaction starts with the form- ation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on. When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes.</p>
<p>Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process [3].</p>
<p>Another possibility to start the reaction sequence is offered by the lower alkenes oligomerization.</p>
<p>Small alkanes (which are abundantly formed in petroleum refining processes) are more difficult to convert to reactive alkenes [6,7,8]. Nowadays the most used process is thermal cracking at temperatures above 800C. This reaction proceedsvia a free radical chain pathway.</p>
<p>It however is known that some transition metals can catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes; a reaction that also can be used to produce reactive small alkenes. Accordingly it should be theoretically possible to convert small alkanes with the help of a bifunctional catalyst to higher hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C. The same catalyst is also suitable for the conversion of propane as was recently shown by Inui and Okazumi [ll]. They ob- served that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2).</p>
<p>In this study we investigated the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures,over Pt/H-ZSM-5. Thus we got information about the initial reactions occuring be- fore the formation of aromatics starts.</p>

This passage discusses the use of zeolite H-ZSM-5 as a catalyst for the conversion of hydrocarbons, particularly focusing on its ability to convert small alkenes and alkanes into a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The zeolite's strong acidic properties and unique pore structure prevent the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules and prevent rapid deactivation. The conversion process typically begins with the formation of a carbenium ion through the adsorption of an alkene onto an acidic group of the zeolite, followed by reactions that lead to the formation of dimers, aromatics, and alkanes. The passage also mentions the use of methanol and lower alkenes in similar conversions, highlighting the potential for using a bifunctional catalyst to convert small alkanes into higher hydrocarbons. The study specifically investigates the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures using a platinum-loaded H-ZSM-5 catalyst, providing insights into the initial reactions before the formation of aromatics.
