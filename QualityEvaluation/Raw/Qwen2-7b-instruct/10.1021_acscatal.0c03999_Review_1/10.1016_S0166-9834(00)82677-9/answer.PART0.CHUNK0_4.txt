[1] "Propane can be converted to products with more than 3 carbon atoms by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5."
[2] "Zeolites with Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores lead to better results than physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt; the conversion is higher and almost no deactivation occurs."
[3] "The conversion experiments over Pt/Na-ZSM-5 support this assumption."
[4] "As can be seen in Table I practically no alkenes are formed."
[5] "Most likely Pt not only catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane but also the hydrogenation of subsequent formed alkenes."
[6] "Although this hydrogenolysis reaction is unfavorable because it leads to products less valuable than propane, it also has a positive effect because it causes a diminishing of the hydrogen partial pressure and thus will stimulate the propane dehydrogenation."
[7] "We obtained a highly crystalline product with Si/A1=30 (0.51 mmol Al/g) and a pore volume of 0.161 ml/g which is in accordance with literature."
[8] "When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes."
[9] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[10] "The presence of the Pt particles inside the zeolite pores near the acid sites has a positive effect on the conversion of propane."

This study investigates the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures over a bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The use of Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores leads to better results compared to physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt, with higher conversion and minimal deactivation. The process involves two main steps: dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. The catalyst also inevitably catalyzes cracking, resulting in the formation of butane as the main higher hydrocarbon product under certain temperature conditions. The presence of Pt particles in the zeolite pores contributes positively to the conversion efficiency.

这项研究探讨了在适度温度下使用Pt/H-ZSM-5双功能催化剂将丙烷转化为更高级烃类物质。将Pt掺入到沸石孔中比物理混合物和负载式Pt催化剂有更好的结果，转化率更高且几乎不会发生失活现象。整个过程分为两个主要步骤：首先，Pt催化丙烷脱氢形成丙烯；随后，在沸石酸性位点上，丙烯进行多聚化形成更高级烃类。催化剂还会不可避免地催化裂解反应，导致在特定温度条件下主要生成丁烷作为更高级烃类的主要产物。Pt颗粒存在于沸石孔中对转化效率产生积极影响。
