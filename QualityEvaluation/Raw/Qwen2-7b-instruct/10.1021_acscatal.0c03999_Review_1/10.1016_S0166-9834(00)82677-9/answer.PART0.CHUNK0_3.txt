[1] "Propane can be converted to products with more than 3 carbon atoms by using a combination of platinum and H-ZSM-5."
[2] "Zeolites with Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores lead to better results than physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt; the conversion is higher and almost no deactivation occurs."
[3] "At least two steps can be distinguished: formation of propene over Pt and subsequent oligomerization over acid sites of the zeolite."
[4] "Moreover a number of inevitable side reactions occur: Pt catalyzed hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis and acid catalyzed cracking."
[5] "The main higher hydrocarbons formed are normal and iso butane."
[6] "The high nC/iC ratio suggests that at reaction temperatures the propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite."
[7] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[8] "The conversion of propane to higher products over the H-ZSM-5 catalyst as function of temperature is depicted in Figure 1."
[9] "Only at high temperature traces of butanes and pentanes were formed."
[10] "Under the same experimental conditions H-ZSM-5 physically mixed with 6 wt.% Pt/SiO2 was more active in the propane conversion."
[11] "The conversion experiments however, were badly reproducible."
[12] "In contrast the 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples behaved catalytically different."
[13] "Firstly the conversion experiments showed a good reproducibility in the temperature range 200-350C."
[14] "Secondly the activity is much higher than that of the catalyst where Pt and H-ZSM-5 were separated."
[15] "The amount of propene compared with the 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst, was higher whereas no products with more than 3 carbon atoms were formed."
[16] "It is likely that over the 4 wt% Pt zeolite propane is directly cleaved to methane and ethane, while over the catalyst with the lower Pt content higher products are hydrogenolysed to ethane (and propane)."
[17] "The fact that the H/C ratio does not change during reaction implies that there is no loss of hydrogen in molecular form; the hydrogen released by the propene formation is fully used for hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis."
[18] "For this purpose we added 20% oxygen to the feed. However this did not result in a higher conversion."

The study demonstrates that combining platinum and H-ZSM-5 catalysts leads to a higher conversion of propane to products with more than 3 carbon atoms compared to physical mixtures of zeolite and supported platinum. This improvement in conversion is accompanied by reduced deactivation. The process involves two main steps: the formation of propene over the platinum surface followed by oligomerization over the acid sites of the zeolite. Side reactions, such as Pt-catalyzed hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, along with acid-catalyzed cracking, also occur. Normal and iso butane are identified as the primary higher hydrocarbons produced, with the high nC/iC ratio suggesting that propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape-selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. Ethane can also be converted to BTX aromatics under certain conditions. The activity of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is notably higher than when Pt is mixed with H-ZSM-5 separately. The conversion of propane is influenced by factors such as temperature, with higher temperatures leading to the formation of butanes and pentanes. The presence of oxygen in the feed does not increase the conversion rate, possibly due to coverage of active platinum sites by alkanes or alkenes, preventing the formation of active atomic oxygen species.

该研究证明，将铂和H-ZSM-5催化剂结合使用可以比物理混合铂与沸石更高效地将丙烷转化为含有超过3个碳原子的产品。这种转化率的提高伴随着较少的失活现象。这一过程包含两个主要步骤：在铂表面形成丙烯，随后在沸石的酸性位点上发生缩合。还会发生铂催化的氢化、氢解以及酸催化裂解等副反应。正常但丁和异丁烷被识别为主要的较高碳数产物，高nC/iC比率表明在给定温度下，丙烯缩合受到H-ZSM-5沸石形状选择性特性的控制。在特定条件下，乙烷也可以转化为BTX芳烃。铂/H-ZSM-5催化剂的活性明显高于单独混合铂与H-ZSM-5的情况。丙烷的转化受温度等影响，随着温度升高，但烷、戊烷等较高碳数产物的形成量增加。向反应物中添加氧气并未增加转化率，可能是因为烷烃或烯烃覆盖了活性铂位点，阻止了活性氧物种的形成。
