[1] "Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates."
[2] "Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range."
[3] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[4] "The presence of the relatively weak C-O bond in methanol enables the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes at moderate temperatures."
[5] "Another possibility to start the reaction sequence is offered by the 0166-9834/85/$03.30 0 1985 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V."
[6] "Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process [3]."
[7] "The reaction starts with the form- ation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite."
[8] "When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes."
[9] "The steric constraints of the zeolite prevent the formation of molecules with more than 10 C-atoms (see Scheme 1)."
[10] "By the action of the strong acid groups these can be cracked to the reactive small alkenes mentioned above."
[11] "Small alkanes (which are abundantly formed in petroleum refining processes) are more difficult to convert to reactive alkenes."
[12] "Nowadays the most used process is thermal cracking at temperatures above 800C."
[13] "Acid catalyzed conversion of these small saturated hydrocarbons is energetically unfavourable because it proceeds via very unstable primary carbeniumion intermediates (see Scheme 2)."
[14] "For the first catalytic function we need a metal active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, for which platinum is appropriate."
[15] "The second function needed for the selective conversion of the formed alkenes can be offered by zeolite H-ZSM-5."
[16] "Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C."
[17] "They ob- served that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2)."
[18] "In this study we investigated the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures,over Pt/H-ZSM-5."
[19] "Thus we got information about the initial reactions occurring before the formation of aromatics starts."
[20] "The conversion experiments however, were badly reproduc- able."
[21] "This value decreased rapidly within a few hours to less than 1 C%."
[22] "In contrast the 0.4 and 4 wt% Pt/H-ZSM-5 samples behaved catalytically different."
[23] "Firstly the conversion experiments showed a good reproducibility in the temperature range 200-350C."
[24] "Secondly the activity is much higher than that of the catalyst where Pt and H-ZSM-5 were separated."
[25] "The conversion started at about 200C and increased with temperature to about 18% for the 4 wt% and 12% for the 0.4 wt% Pt zeolite at 330C."
[26] "The product distributions obtained with the Pt loaded catalysts showed a number of interesting features (see Figure 2)."
[27] "For both catalysts the absolute amount of unsaturated products was small; mainly alkanes were formed."
[28] "It appears that both catalysts can convert propane to higher hydrocarbons."
[29] "At temperatures below 250C butane was practically the sole product."
[30] "At higher temperatures (>3OO"C) the butane selectivity tended to decrease, while the format- ion of higher alkanes and aromatics (Ci) became noticable."
[31] "Not only higher products were formed: above 250C over the 4 wt% Pt H-ZSM-5 catalyst equimolar amounts of methane and ethane were formed."
[32] "In contrast the 0.4 wt% Pt catalyst produced only ethane as lower product."
[33] "The conversion over the non-acid 4 wt%Pt/Na-ZSM-5 differed from the conversion Over the acid Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst (see Figure 4)."
[34] "Again no deactivation was observed."
[35] "The conversion to higher products and the product distribution remained the same, moreover the H/C ratio was equal to that of propane."
