<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding via carbeniumion intermediates.</p>
<p>Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range [Z].</p>
<p>The reaction starts with the formation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on.</p>
<p>When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes. The steric constraints of the zeolite prevent the formation of molecules with more than 10 C-atoms (see Scheme 1).</p>
<p>Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process [3].</p>
<p>The presence of the relatively weak C-O bond in methanol enables the acid-catalyzed formation of small alkenes at moderate temperatures.</p>
<p>Another possibility to start the reaction sequence is offered by the conversion of small alkanes to reactive small alkenes [6,7,8].</p>
<p>For the first catalytic function we need a metal active in the dehydrogenation of alkanes, for which platinum is appropriate [9].</p>
<p>The second function needed for the selective conversion of the formed alkenes can be offered by zeolite H-ZSM-5.</p>
<p>Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C.</p>
<p>The same catalyst is also suitable for the conversion of propane as was recently shown by Inui and Okazumi [ll].</p>
<p>In this study we investigated the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures,over Pt/H-ZSM-5.</p>

The document discusses the use of a bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst for the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite provides strong acidic properties and shape-selective properties, which prevent the formation of large molecules. Platinum, on the other hand, catalyzes the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The conversion process involves two main steps: the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over the Pt sites, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acidic sites of the zeolite. Side reactions such as hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis also occur. The main products formed are normal and iso butane, and the high nC/iC ratio suggests that at the reaction temperatures, propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape-selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The conversion is higher and shows almost no deactivation when using a Pt-loaded H-ZSM-5 catalyst compared to a physical mixture of zeolite and supported Pt. The activity balance between Pt and the acid sites is not perfect, leading to the formation of butane as the main higher hydrocarbon product at temperatures below 350°C. Additionally, the document mentions that platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms new C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the formation of methane, ethane, and mainly saturated hydrocarbons. The use of a metal other than platinum or a hydrogen scavenger may improve the selectivity for more valuable products.

本文讨论了使用Pt/H-ZSM-5双功能催化剂将丙烷转化为更高碳数化合物的应用。H-ZSM-5沸石提供了较强的酸性和形状选择性，防止了大分子的形成。铂则催化了烷烃的脱氢反应。转化过程包括两个主要步骤：丙烷在铂位点上脱氢生成丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上进行多聚化。还会发生副反应如氢化和氢解。主要产物为正丁烷和异丁烷，高nC/iC比率表明在反应温度下，丙烯多聚化受到沸石形状选择性的控制。与物理混合的氧化铂和H-ZSM-5相比，使用负载有铂的H-ZSM-5催化剂时，转化率更高且几乎不发生失活。铂和酸性位点之间的活性平衡并不完美，导致在低于350°C的温度下，但烷作为主要的更高碳数产物形成。此外，铂不仅断裂C-H键，还通过氢化和氢解形成了新的C-H键，从而产生了甲烷、乙烷和主要的饱和烃。使用除了铂以外的金属或氢 scavenger可能会提高对更有价值产品的选择性。
