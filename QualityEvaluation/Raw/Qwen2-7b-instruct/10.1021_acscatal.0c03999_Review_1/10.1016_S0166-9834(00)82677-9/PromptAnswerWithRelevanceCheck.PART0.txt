<p>Zeolite H-ZSM-5 possesses strong acidic properties which makes it a suitable catalyst for hydrocarbon reactions proceeding uia carbeniumion intermediates.</p>
<p>In addition, the unique pore system of this type of zeolite hinders the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules [l], thus preventing the socalled coke deposition, which normally causes a rapid deactivation of acid catalysts.</p>
<p>Due to these properties H-ZSM-5 is appropriate for the conversion of highly reactive small alkenes to a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons which are predominantly in the gasoline boiling range [Z].</p>
<p>The reaction starts with the form- ation of a carbeniumion by the adsorption of an alkene on an acidic group of the zeolite. Next this carbeniumion reacts with a second alkene to form a dimer and so on. When the C-number exceeds 6, cyclization can occur, subsequently H-transfer reactions result in the formation of a mixture of aromatics and alkanes.</p>
<p>Instead of small alkenes also methanol can be used as starting material, as is done in the Mobil MTG process [3].</p>
<p>Another possibility to start the reaction sequence is offered by the lower alkenes oligomerization.</p>
<p>Small alkanes (which are abundantly formed in petroleum refining processes) are more difficult to convert to reactive alkenes [6,7,8]. Nowadays the most used process is thermal cracking at temperatures above 800C. This reaction proceedsvia a free radical chain pathway.</p>
<p>It however is known that some transition metals can catalyze the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes; a reaction that also can be used to produce reactive small alkenes. Accordingly it should be theoretically possible to convert small alkanes with the help of a bifunctional catalyst to higher hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>Indeed it was shown by Chu [lo] that ethane can be converted to BTX aromatics over platinum loaded H-ZSM-5 at about 600C. The same catalyst is also suitable for the conversion of propane as was recently shown by Inui and Okazumi [ll]. They ob- served that the formation of aromatics at elevated temperatures is coupled to the formation of smaller products (CI,C2).</p>
<p>In this study we investigated the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures,over Pt/H-ZSM-5. Thus we got information about the initial reactions occuring be- fore the formation of aromatics starts.</p>

This passage discusses the use of zeolite H-ZSM-5 as a catalyst for the conversion of hydrocarbons, particularly focusing on its ability to convert small alkenes and alkanes into a mixture of alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The zeolite's strong acidic properties and unique pore structure prevent the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules and prevent rapid deactivation. The conversion process typically begins with the formation of a carbenium ion through the adsorption of an alkene onto an acidic group of the zeolite, followed by reactions that lead to the formation of dimers, aromatics, and alkanes. The passage also mentions the use of methanol and lower alkenes in similar conversions, highlighting the potential for using a bifunctional catalyst to convert small alkanes into higher hydrocarbons. The study specifically investigates the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures using a platinum-loaded H-ZSM-5 catalyst, providing insights into the initial reactions before the formation of aromatics.

The document discusses the use of a bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst for the conversion of propane to higher hydrocarbons. The H-ZSM-5 zeolite provides strong acidic properties and shape-selective properties, which prevent the formation of large molecules. Platinum, on the other hand, catalyzes the dehydrogenation of alkanes. The conversion process involves two main steps: the dehydrogenation of propane to propene over the Pt sites, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acidic sites of the zeolite. Side reactions such as hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis also occur. The main products formed are normal and iso butane, and the high nC/iC ratio suggests that at the reaction temperatures, propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape-selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. The conversion is higher and shows almost no deactivation when using a Pt-loaded H-ZSM-5 catalyst compared to a physical mixture of zeolite and supported Pt. The activity balance between Pt and the acid sites is not perfect, leading to the formation of butane as the main higher hydrocarbon product at temperatures below 350°C. Additionally, the document mentions that platinum not only breaks C-H bonds but also forms new C-H bonds through hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, resulting in the formation of methane, ethane, and mainly saturated hydrocarbons. The use of a metal other than platinum or a hydrogen scavenger may improve the selectivity for more valuable products.

本文讨论了使用Pt/H-ZSM-5双功能催化剂将丙烷转化为更高碳数化合物的应用。H-ZSM-5沸石提供了较强的酸性和形状选择性，防止了大分子的形成。铂则催化了烷烃的脱氢反应。转化过程包括两个主要步骤：丙烷在铂位点上脱氢生成丙烯，随后丙烯在沸石的酸性位点上进行多聚化。还会发生副反应如氢化和氢解。主要产物为正丁烷和异丁烷，高nC/iC比率表明在反应温度下，丙烯多聚化受到沸石形状选择性的控制。与物理混合的氧化铂和H-ZSM-5相比，使用负载有铂的H-ZSM-5催化剂时，转化率更高且几乎不发生失活。铂和酸性位点之间的活性平衡并不完美，导致在低于350°C的温度下，但烷作为主要的更高碳数产物形成。此外，铂不仅断裂C-H键，还通过氢化和氢解形成了新的C-H键，从而产生了甲烷、乙烷和主要的饱和烃。使用除了铂以外的金属或氢 scavenger可能会提高对更有价值产品的选择性。

The study demonstrates that combining platinum and H-ZSM-5 catalysts leads to a higher conversion of propane to products with more than 3 carbon atoms compared to physical mixtures of zeolite and supported platinum. This improvement in conversion is accompanied by reduced deactivation. The process involves two main steps: the formation of propene over the platinum surface followed by oligomerization over the acid sites of the zeolite. Side reactions, such as Pt-catalyzed hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis, along with acid-catalyzed cracking, also occur. Normal and iso butane are identified as the primary higher hydrocarbons produced, with the high nC/iC ratio suggesting that propene oligomerization is controlled by the shape-selective properties of the H-ZSM-5 zeolite. Ethane can also be converted to BTX aromatics under certain conditions. The activity of the Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst is notably higher than when Pt is mixed with H-ZSM-5 separately. The conversion of propane is influenced by factors such as temperature, with higher temperatures leading to the formation of butanes and pentanes. The presence of oxygen in the feed does not increase the conversion rate, possibly due to coverage of active platinum sites by alkanes or alkenes, preventing the formation of active atomic oxygen species.

该研究证明，将铂和H-ZSM-5催化剂结合使用可以比物理混合铂与沸石更高效地将丙烷转化为含有超过3个碳原子的产品。这种转化率的提高伴随着较少的失活现象。这一过程包含两个主要步骤：在铂表面形成丙烯，随后在沸石的酸性位点上发生缩合。还会发生铂催化的氢化、氢解以及酸催化裂解等副反应。正常但丁和异丁烷被识别为主要的较高碳数产物，高nC/iC比率表明在给定温度下，丙烯缩合受到H-ZSM-5沸石形状选择性特性的控制。在特定条件下，乙烷也可以转化为BTX芳烃。铂/H-ZSM-5催化剂的活性明显高于单独混合铂与H-ZSM-5的情况。丙烷的转化受温度等影响，随着温度升高，但烷、戊烷等较高碳数产物的形成量增加。向反应物中添加氧气并未增加转化率，可能是因为烷烃或烯烃覆盖了活性铂位点，阻止了活性氧物种的形成。

This study investigates the conversion of propane at moderate temperatures over a bifunctional Pt/H-ZSM-5 catalyst. The use of Pt incorporated in the zeolite pores leads to better results compared to physical mixtures of zeolite and supported Pt, with higher conversion and minimal deactivation. The process involves two main steps: dehydrogenation of propane to propene by Pt, followed by oligomerization of propene over the acid sites of the zeolite. The catalyst also inevitably catalyzes cracking, resulting in the formation of butane as the main higher hydrocarbon product under certain temperature conditions.
