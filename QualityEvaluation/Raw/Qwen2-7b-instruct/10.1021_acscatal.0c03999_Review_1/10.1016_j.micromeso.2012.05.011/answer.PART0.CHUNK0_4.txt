[1] "The role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as propane, over chromium oxide-based catalysts, is to enhance the yield of propene and the stability of the catalyst. The promoting role of CO2 is attributed mainly to its weak oxidative properties."
[2] "Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the activation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed."
[3] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
[4] "The in situ UVvis DR results obtained during dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 reveal that in both cases the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly already at the beginning of the process."
[5] "As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."
[6] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. CO2 plays a crucial role in enhancing the yield of propene and the stability of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. Its weak oxidative properties enable it to activate CO2 in the oxidative pathway, requiring high-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+) for activation.

2. The catalytic activity and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP are influenced by the presence of high-valent redox chromium species. The more high-valent species present, the higher the catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Among the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts, the one with 7 wt.% Cr content demonstrated the highest catalytic activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, achieving a maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550°C.

4. The Cr6+ species, acting as the primary redox sites, are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species at the start of the dehydrogenation process in both CO2-present and CO2-absent conditions.

5. The catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is significantly linked to the presence of reducible Cr sites that form a redox cycle, enhancing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

6. Partial catalyst deactivation is primarily attributed to excessive coke formation, affecting the catalytic performance and efficiency of the Crx/SBA-1 materials over time.

1. 在铬氧化物基催化剂的脱氢过程中，二氧化碳的主要作用是增强丙烷转化为丙烯的产率和催化剂的稳定性。其弱氧化性质使二氧化碳在氧化途径中被激活，需要高电荷价态的可还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+和Cr3+）参与激活过程。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂对CO2-ODHP的活性和选择性受到高电荷价态可还原铬物种存在的影响。这些物种越多，催化活性和选择性越高。

3. 在Crx/SBA-1催化剂中，含有7 wt.% Cr含量的样品在二氧化碳存在下表现出最高的催化活性和选择性，在丙烷脱氢过程中实现了最高丙烷转化率37.7%，温度为550°C。

4. 在开始脱氢过程时，Cr6+物种作为主要的红ox物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，在有或无二氧化碳的条件下均如此。

5. 铬x/SBA-1材料的催化活性与可还原Cr位点形成红ox循环密切相关，这些位点形成循环增强了脱氢过程的效率。

6. 催化剂的部分失活主要是由于过量焦炭形成导致的，这影响了Crx/SBA-1材料的催化性能和效率随时间的变化。
