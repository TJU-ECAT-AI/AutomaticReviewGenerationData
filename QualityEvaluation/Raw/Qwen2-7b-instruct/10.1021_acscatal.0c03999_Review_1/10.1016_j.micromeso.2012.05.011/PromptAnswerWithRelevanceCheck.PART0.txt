[1] "In a recent study, we have explored SBA-1 mesoporous silica as a support for a Cr-containing catalyst obtained by one-pot method (direct synthesis) for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [19]."
[2] "The study showed that due to the strongly acidic conditions needed for SBA-1 preparation, the dispersion of the Cr species in the SBA-1 matrix is limited and has a negative impact on the catalytic performance of the resultant system."
[3] "In the present work, we report the strategy for preparation of the very efficient Cr/SBA-1 catalyst. A series of Crx/SBA-1 catalysts with Cr content in the range of 115 wt.% were obtained by the incipient wetness impregnation, characterized with various physi- cochemical techniques and tested in the dehydrogenation of pro- pane in the presence of CO2."
[4] "In-situ UV-vis DRS"
[5] "Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the acti- vation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chro- mium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed."
[6] "The redox properties of the calcined Crx/SBA-1 catalysts were investigated by H2-TPR and the resulting profiles are shown in Fig. 3A."
[7] "In the case of the Cr15/SBA-1 sample an additional small maximum appeared at about 310 C. The location of this maximum coincided with the low-temperature reduction maximum observed for calcined a- Cr2O3, which is assigned to the reduction of surface Cr6+ to Cr3+ or Cr2+ species [29]."
[8] "The results of the in situ UVvis DR measurements obtained during the first 10 min on-stream led to a conclusion that in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the Cr6+ species play a similar role as in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation, i.e. they are the precursors of dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit high activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [29,37,38]."
[9] "Moreover, the slight decrease of the H2-consumption shows that a small fraction (7.4%) of Cr redox species is lost."
[10] "The observed partial deactiva- tion of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by exces- sive coke formation."

[2] "The oxidation state and the structures of Cr species deposited on the surface of SBA-1 vary in the Crtotal content. In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."

[4] "As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."

1. Chromium species like Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were identified in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 catalysts. Despite the chromium loading, Cr6+ species were mostly found as mono- and dichromates. The presence of dispersed Cr5+ and crystalline a-Cr2O3 depended on the total Crtotal content. All catalysts showed high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation to propene with CO2, achieving a maximum conversion of 37.7% at 550 C for 7 wt.% Crtotal. Higher Cr contents resulted in constant propane conversion due to crystalline Cr2O3 formation, which was inactive. Redox Cr6+ species were quickly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the start of the process. These dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main active sites for reactants under dehydrogenation conditions. High-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+) are essential for CO2 activation in the oxidative pathway. High surface area supports like SBA-1 provided more adsorption sites for stabilizing redox Cr species. An additional maximum of 310 C was observed in the Cr5/SBA-1 sample, coinciding with the low-temperature reduction maximum of calcined a-Cr2O3. The formation of crystalline Cr2O3 led to unfavorable effects at high Cr content. Catalysts prepared by impregnation showed better performance than those obtained by direct methods. The spectra intensity was higher during CO2-assisted processes. The background intensity grew progressively, likely due to coke formation. Coke reacted with oxygen between 320 and 450 C for the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst.

1. 研究发现，煅烧后的Crx/SBA-1催化剂中存在铬物种，如Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和结晶态Cr2O3。尽管铬含量不同，Cr6+物种主要以单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐形式存在。Cr5+物种和结晶态a-Cr2O3的存在取决于总Crtotal含量。所有催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程中表现出高活性和选择性，在存在CO2时，达到37.7%的最大丙烷转化率（在550°C下）对于7 wt.% Crtotal。更高的Cr含量导致丙烷转化率保持不变，这是由于结晶态Cr2O3的形成，该物质在测试反应中是不活跃的。红氧化合物Cr6+物种在过程开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种。这些分散的Cr2+/Cr3+离子在脱氢条件下是反应物的主要活性位点。在氧化路径中，高电荷价态的红氧化合物Cr6+、Cr5+和Cr3+是必不可少的。高比表面积支持如SBA-1提供了更多吸附位点来稳定红氧化合物Cr物种。Cr5/SBA-1样品中观察到一个额外的310°C的最大值，与煅烧a-Cr2O3的低温还原最大值相吻合。Cr2O3的形成导致在高Cr含量时出现不利效果。通过浸渍法制备的催化剂比直接方法制备的催化剂表现更好。背景强度的增加可能是由于焦炭形成的差异。Cr5/SBA-1催化剂中的焦炭在320至450°C的温度范围内与氧气反应。

1. A series of chromium oxide catalysts supported by SBA-1 were synthesized with varying chromium content (Crtotal) through incipient wetness impregnation. The chromium species present mainly included Cr6+ in the form of mono- and dichromates, regardless of the chromium loading. The formation of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content. All of these catalysts showed excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550°C for a 7 wt.% Crtotal.

2. The reduction peak at 410-461°C in the H2-TPR profiles was attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ species directly attached to the siliceous support. 

3. The yield of propene produced over catalysts obtained by impregnation remained stable at low chromium contents and did not drop sharply above 3.5 wt.% of Cr, unlike catalysts prepared by the direct method. 

4. The intensity of the UVvis DR spectra in the process carried out in the presence of CO2 was higher compared to the process without CO2, as shown in Figure 5G.

5. The slight decrease in the specific surface area, total pore volume, average pore diameter, and hydrogen consumption after 4 dehydrogenation cycles indicates that the cubic pore structure of the SBA-1 support was generally preserved. A small fraction (7.4%) of Cr redox species was lost during the process.

1. 一系列通过浸渍法在SBA-1上支持的铬氧化物催化剂被合成，其铬含量（Crtotal）变化为1、3、5、7、10和15 wt.%。铬物种主要以Cr6+的形式存在，以单重和二重铬酸盐为主，与铬负载无关。在煅烧催化剂中，分散的Cr5+物种和晶态a-Cr2O3的存在依赖于总Crtotal含量。所有这些催化剂在二氧化碳存在下对丙烷脱氢反应显示出极佳的催化活性和高选择性，在丙烷转化率为37.7%，温度为550°C时，对应于7 wt.%的Crtotal。

2. H2-TPR谱图中的410-461°C的还原峰归因于直接附着在硅质支撑上的Cr6+物种的还原。

3. 对比直接法和浸渍法制备的催化剂，浸渍法制备的催化剂在低铬含量时表现出较高的丙烯产率，并且在高于3.5 wt.% Cr时产率没有急剧下降，而直接法制备的催化剂产率则迅速下降。

4. 图5G显示，与不含二氧化碳的过程相比，含有二氧化碳的过程的UVvis DR光谱强度更高。

5. 经过4个脱氢周期后，特定表面积、总孔体积、平均孔径和氢消耗量的小幅减少表明SBA-1的立方孔结构得到了较好的保持。损失的Cr可逆物种的比例为7.4%。

1. CO2 plays a crucial role in enhancing the yield of propene and the stability of chromium oxide-based catalysts in dehydrogenation processes. Its weak oxidative properties enable it to activate CO2 in the oxidative pathway, requiring high-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+) for activation.

2. The catalytic activity and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP are influenced by the presence of high-valent redox chromium species. The more high-valent species present, the higher the catalytic activity and selectivity.

3. Among the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts, the one with 7 wt.% Cr content demonstrated the highest catalytic activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2, achieving a maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550°C.

4. The Cr6+ species, acting as the primary redox sites, are rapidly reduced to Cr3+ and Cr2+ species at the start of the dehydrogenation process in both CO2-present and CO2-absent conditions.

5. The catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials is significantly linked to the presence of reducible Cr sites that form a redox cycle, enhancing the efficiency of the dehydrogenation process.

6. Partial catalyst deactivation is primarily attributed to excessive coke formation, affecting the catalytic performance and efficiency of the Crx/SBA-1 materials over time.

1. 在铬氧化物基催化剂的脱氢过程中，二氧化碳的主要作用是增强丙烷转化为丙烯的产率和催化剂的稳定性。其弱氧化性质使二氧化碳在氧化途径中被激活，需要高电荷价态的可还原铬物种（Cr6+、Cr5+和Cr3+）参与激活过程。

2. 铬氧化物催化剂对CO2-ODHP的活性和选择性受到高电荷价态可还原铬物种存在的影响。这些物种越多，催化活性和选择性越高。

3. 在Crx/SBA-1催化剂中，含有7 wt.% Cr含量的样品在二氧化碳存在下表现出最高的催化活性和选择性，在丙烷脱氢过程中实现了最高丙烷转化率37.7%，温度为550°C。

4. 在开始脱氢过程时，Cr6+物种作为主要的红ox物种迅速还原为Cr3+和Cr2+物种，在有或无二氧化碳的条件下均如此。

5. 铬x/SBA-1材料的催化活性与可还原Cr位点形成红ox循环密切相关，这些位点形成循环增强了脱氢过程的效率。

6. 催化剂的部分失活主要是由于过量焦炭形成导致的，这影响了Crx/SBA-1材料的催化性能和效率随时间的变化。
