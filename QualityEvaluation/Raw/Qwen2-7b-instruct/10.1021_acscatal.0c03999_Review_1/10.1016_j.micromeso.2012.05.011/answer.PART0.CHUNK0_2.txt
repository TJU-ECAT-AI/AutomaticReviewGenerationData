[1] "Various chromium species including Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were found in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 samples."
[2] "Cr6+ species were present mainly in the form of mono- and dichromates, despite the Cr loading."

[4] "All of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2 with the maximum propane conversion (37.7% at 550 C) for 7 wt.% of Crtotal."
[5] "For higher Cr contents the conversion of propane remained almost constant which was connected with the formation of crystalline Cr2O3 which was inactive in the test reaction."

1. Chromium species like Cr6+, dispersed Cr5+, and crystalline Cr2O3 were identified in the calcined Crx/SBA-1 catalysts. Despite the chromium loading, Cr6+ species were mostly found as mono- and dichromates. The presence of dispersed Cr5+ and crystalline a-Cr2O3 depended on the total Crtotal content. All catalysts showed high activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation to propene with CO2, achieving a maximum conversion of 37.7% at 550 C for 7 wt.% Crtotal. Higher Cr contents resulted in constant propane conversion due to crystalline Cr2O3 formation, which was inactive. Redox Cr6+ species were quickly reduced to Cr2+/Cr3+ species at the start of the process. These dispersed Cr2+/Cr3+ ions were the main active sites for reactants under dehydrogenation conditions. High-valent redox chromium species (Cr6+, Cr5+, and Cr3+) are essential for CO2 activation in the oxidative pathway. High surface area supports like SBA-1 provided more adsorption sites for stabilizing redox Cr species. An additional maximum of 310 C was observed in the Cr5/SBA-1 sample, coinciding with the low-temperature reduction maximum of calcined a-Cr2O3. The formation of crystalline Cr2O3 led to unfavorable effects at high Cr content. Catalysts prepared by impregnation showed better performance than those obtained by direct methods. The spectra intensity was higher during CO2-assisted processes. The background intensity grew progressively, likely due to coke formation. Coke reacted with oxygen between 320 and 450 C for the Cr5/SBA-1 catalyst.

1. 研究发现，煅烧后的Crx/SBA-1催化剂中存在铬物种，如Cr6+、分散的Cr5+和结晶态Cr2O3。尽管铬含量不同，Cr6+物种主要以单铬酸盐和二铬酸盐形式存在。Cr5+物种和结晶态a-Cr2O3的存在取决于总Crtotal含量。所有催化剂在丙烷脱氢为丙烯的过程中表现出高活性和选择性，在存在CO2时，达到37.7%的最大丙烷转化率（在550°C下）对于7 wt.% Crtotal。更高的Cr含量导致丙烷转化率保持不变，这是由于结晶态Cr2O3的形成，该物质在测试反应中是不活跃的。红氧化合物Cr6+物种在过程开始时迅速还原为Cr2+/Cr3+物种。这些分散的Cr2+/Cr3+离子在脱氢条件下是反应物的主要活性位点。在氧化路径中，高电荷价态的红氧化合物Cr6+、Cr5+和Cr3+是必不可少的。高比表面积支持如SBA-1提供了更多吸附位点来稳定红氧化合物Cr物种。Cr5/SBA-1样品中观察到一个额外的310°C的最大值，与煅烧a-Cr2O3的低温还原最大值相吻合。Cr2O3的形成导致在高Cr含量时出现不利效果。通过浸渍法制备的催化剂比直接方法制备的催化剂表现更好。背景强度的增加可能是由于焦炭形成的差异。Cr5/SBA-1催化剂中的焦炭在320至450°C的温度范围内与氧气反应。
