[1] "Mesoporous cubic Crx/SBA-1 catalysts containing well-dispersed chromium species in a wide range of Cr loadings were prepared by simple incipient wetness impregnation."
[2] "The oxidation state and the structures of Cr species deposited on the surface of SBA-1 vary in the Crtotal content. In the calcined catalysts chromium species are stabilized as Cr6+ species, dispersed Cr5+, and agglomerated Cr3+ species."
[3] "Below 7 wt.% of Cr the high-valent species, mainly Cr6+ in the form of chromates and dichromates dominate, whereas above this content both, Cr6+ in the form of dichromates and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3, coexist."
[4] "As a result, the catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials rises together with the increasing number of high-valent Cr species."
[5] "The in situ UVvis DR results obtained during dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 reveal that in both cases the Cr6+ species are reduced rapidly already at the beginning of the process."
[6] "The resultant Cr2+ and Cr3+ species trigger redox cycles responsible for high catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 materials."
[7] "The observed partial deactivation of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by excessive coke formation."

1. Supported Cr2O3 catalysts were prepared through incipient wetness impregnation. The activity and selectivity of these catalysts in CO2-ODHP depend on the chromium loading and support properties.
2. The oxidation state of chromium species on the surface varies with chromium content. At lower loads, high-valent Cr6+ species dominate, while at higher loads, Cr6+ and agglomerated Cr3+ species in the form of crystalline a-Cr2O3 coexist.
3. The catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts increases with the number of high-valent Cr species.
4. Cr6+ species are rapidly reduced to Cr2+ and Cr3+ species at the start of the dehydrogenation process in the presence and absence of CO2.
5. The reduced Cr2+ and Cr3+ species activate redox cycles that contribute to the high catalytic activity of the Crx/SBA-1 catalysts.
6. The catalysts' partial deactivation is attributed to excessive coke formation.

1. 通过浸渍湿法，制备了支持的Cr2O3催化剂。这些催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性取决于铬负载和载体性质。
2. 铬物种的氧化状态随铬含量变化。在较低负载下，主要为高电荷Cr6+物种，而在较高负载下，则存在Cr6+和聚集的Cr3+物种，以结晶态a-Cr2O3的形式存在。
3. Crx/SBA-1催化剂的活性随着高电荷Cr物种的数量增加而增加。
4. 在CO2的存在与否下，过程开始时，Cr6+物种迅速还原为Cr2+和Cr3+物种。
5. 还原后的Cr2+和Cr3+物种激活了负责高催化活性的红ox循环。
6. 催化剂的部分失活归因于过量的焦炭形成。
