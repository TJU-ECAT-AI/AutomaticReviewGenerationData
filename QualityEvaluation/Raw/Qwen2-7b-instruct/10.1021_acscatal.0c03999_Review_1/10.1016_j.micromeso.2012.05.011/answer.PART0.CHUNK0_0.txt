[1] "In a recent study, we have explored SBA-1 mesoporous silica as a support for a Cr-containing catalyst obtained by one-pot method (direct synthesis) for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [19]."
[2] "The study showed that due to the strongly acidic conditions needed for SBA-1 preparation, the dispersion of the Cr species in the SBA-1 matrix is limited and has a negative impact on the catalytic performance of the resultant system."
[3] "In the present work, we report the strategy for preparation of the very efficient Cr/SBA-1 catalyst. A series of Crx/SBA-1 catalysts with Cr content in the range of 115 wt.% were obtained by the incipient wetness impregnation, characterized with various physi- cochemical techniques and tested in the dehydrogenation of pro- pane in the presence of CO2."
[4] "In-situ UV-vis DRS"
[5] "Regardless of the oxidation state of Cr species which participate in the redox mechanism, it is clear from the above that for the acti- vation of CO2 in the oxidative pathway, high-valent redox chro- mium species (Cr6+, Cr5+ and Cr3+) are needed."
[6] "The redox properties of the calcined Crx/SBA-1 catalysts were investigated by H2-TPR and the resulting profiles are shown in Fig. 3A."
[7] "In the case of the Cr15/SBA-1 sample an additional small maximum appeared at about 310 C. The location of this maximum coincided with the low-temperature reduction maximum observed for calcined a- Cr2O3, which is assigned to the reduction of surface Cr6+ to Cr3+ or Cr2+ species [29]."
[8] "The results of the in situ UVvis DR measurements obtained during the first 10 min on-stream led to a conclusion that in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 the Cr6+ species play a similar role as in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation, i.e. they are the precursors of dispersed Cr3+ and Cr2+ species which exhibit high activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [29,37,38]."
[9] "Moreover, the slight decrease of the H2-consumption shows that a small fraction (7.4%) of Cr redox species is lost."
[10] "The observed partial deactiva- tion of the catalysts can be quantified and accounted for by exces- sive coke formation."
