1. A series of chromium oxide catalysts supported by SBA-1 were synthesized with varying chromium content (Crtotal) through incipient wetness impregnation. The chromium species present mainly included Cr6+ in the form of mono- and dichromates, regardless of the chromium loading. The formation of dispersed Cr5+ species and crystalline a-Cr2O3 in the calcined catalysts depended on the total Crtotal content. All of these catalysts showed excellent catalytic activity and high selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of CO2, achieving a maximum propane conversion of 37.7% at 550°C for a 7 wt.% Crtotal.

2. The reduction peak at 410-461°C in the H2-TPR profiles was attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ species directly attached to the siliceous support. 

3. The yield of propene produced over catalysts obtained by impregnation remained stable at low chromium contents and did not drop sharply above 3.5 wt.% of Cr, unlike catalysts prepared by the direct method. 

4. The intensity of the UVvis DR spectra in the process carried out in the presence of CO2 was higher compared to the process without CO2, as shown in Figure 5G.

5. The slight decrease in the specific surface area, total pore volume, average pore diameter, and hydrogen consumption after 4 dehydrogenation cycles indicates that the cubic pore structure of the SBA-1 support was generally preserved. A small fraction (7.4%) of Cr redox species was lost during the process.

1. 一系列通过浸渍法在SBA-1上支持的铬氧化物催化剂被合成，其铬含量（Crtotal）变化为1、3、5、7、10和15 wt.%。铬物种主要以Cr6+的形式存在，以单重和二重铬酸盐为主，与铬负载无关。在煅烧催化剂中，分散的Cr5+物种和晶态a-Cr2O3的存在依赖于总Crtotal含量。所有这些催化剂在二氧化碳存在下对丙烷脱氢反应显示出极佳的催化活性和高选择性，在丙烷转化率为37.7%，温度为550°C时，对应于7 wt.%的Crtotal。

2. H2-TPR谱图中的410-461°C的还原峰归因于直接附着在硅质支撑上的Cr6+物种的还原。

3. 对比直接法和浸渍法制备的催化剂，浸渍法制备的催化剂在低铬含量时表现出较高的丙烯产率，并且在高于3.5 wt.% Cr时产率没有急剧下降，而直接法制备的催化剂产率则迅速下降。

4. 图5G显示，与不含二氧化碳的过程相比，含有二氧化碳的过程的UVvis DR光谱强度更高。

5. 经过4个脱氢周期后，特定表面积、总孔体积、平均孔径和氢消耗量的小幅减少表明SBA-1的立方孔结构得到了较好的保持。损失的Cr可逆物种的比例为7.4%。
