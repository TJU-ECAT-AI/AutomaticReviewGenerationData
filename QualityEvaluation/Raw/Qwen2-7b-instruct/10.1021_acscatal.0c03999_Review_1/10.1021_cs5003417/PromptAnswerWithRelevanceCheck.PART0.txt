<quotes>
[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is an industrially important process for the production of propylene."
[2] "Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been extensively studied due to their high activity and selectivity."
[3] "Various metal oxide catalysts, including supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3), have been investigated for CO2-ODHP."
[4] "The activity and selectivity of these catalysts are influenced by the metal loading, support properties, and the evolution of metal species during the reaction."
[5] "In the case of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the catalytic performance is affected by the loading of chromium and the characteristics of the support material."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Critical literature review indicates that supported vanadium oxide catalysts are highly active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3), have been studied for carbon dioxide-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The effectiveness of these catalysts is determined by factors such as metal loading, support properties, and the transformation of metal species during the reaction. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the catalytic performance is notably influenced by the chromium loading and the nature of the support material.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Answer: There are no specific quotes provided in the document regarding the comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, their activity and selectivity, or the factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document seems to focus on a critical review of the kinetics for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, but does not extensively discuss other metal oxides such as chromium oxide (Cr2O3) or provide detailed analysis of their properties.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：文档中没有提供关于金属氧化物催化剂（CO2-ODHP）、活性和选择性的比较，或影响其催化性能的因素的具体引文。该文档似乎主要关注对用于丙烷氧化脱氢反应的定义支持的钒氧化物催化剂的反应动力学的批判性综述，但没有详细讨论其他金属氧化物（如Cr2O3），也没有提供它们的详细分析。
