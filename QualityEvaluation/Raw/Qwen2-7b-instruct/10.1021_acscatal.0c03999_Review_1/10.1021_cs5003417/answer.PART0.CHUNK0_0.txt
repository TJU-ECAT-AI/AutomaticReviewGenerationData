Critical literature review indicates that supported vanadium oxide catalysts are highly active and selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3), have been studied for carbon dioxide-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The effectiveness of these catalysts is determined by factors such as metal loading, support properties, and the transformation of metal species during the reaction. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the catalytic performance is notably influenced by the chromium loading and the nature of the support material.
