[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was studied over a series of alumina-supported vanadia catalysts with varying amounts of secondary surface metal oxide additives."
[2] "It was observed that the addition of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) significantly improved the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP compared to pure vanadia."
[3] "However, the selectivity towards CO2 production was found to decrease with increasing Cr2O3 loading."
[4] "The study also highlighted the importance of the support properties, noting that alumina with higher pore volume led to better dispersion of metal oxides and consequently improved catalytic performance."

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) was found to significantly enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP compared to pure vanadia. However, this improvement was accompanied by a decrease in selectivity towards CO2 production. The study emphasized the importance of support properties, indicating that alumina with higher pore volume facilitated better dispersion of metal oxides, leading to improved catalytic performance. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was observed to be influenced by both the loading and the support properties, impacting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity.
