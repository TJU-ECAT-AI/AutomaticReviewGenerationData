        [1] "In this study, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was investigated over alumina-supported vanadia catalysts."
        [2] "The results showed that the addition of CO2 significantly influenced the activity and selectivity of the catalysts."
        [3] "The use of secondary surface metal oxide additives further improved the catalytic performance."
        [4] "Notably, the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was found to depend on the loading and support properties."

        The study examined the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over vanadia catalysts supported on alumina, with the addition of CO2 affecting the catalysts' activity and selectivity. Secondary surface metal oxide additives enhanced the catalytic performance. The formation of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was influenced by the loading and support properties.
