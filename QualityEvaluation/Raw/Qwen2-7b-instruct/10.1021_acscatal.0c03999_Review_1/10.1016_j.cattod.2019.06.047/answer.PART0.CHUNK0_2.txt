[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was studied over a series of alumina-supported vanadia catalysts with varying amounts of secondary surface metal oxide additives."
[2] "It was observed that the addition of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) significantly improved the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP compared to pure vanadia."
[3] "However, the selectivity towards CO2 production was found to decrease with increasing Cr2O3 loading."
[4] "The study also highlighted the importance of the support properties, noting that alumina with higher pore volume led to better dispersion of metal oxides and consequently improved catalytic performance."
[5] "In the context of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species was influenced by both the loading and the support properties, affecting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity."

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) was found to significantly enhance the catalytic activity for CO2-ODHP compared to pure vanadia. However, this improvement was accompanied by a decrease in selectivity towards CO2 production. The study emphasized the importance of support properties, indicating that alumina with higher pore volume facilitated better dispersion of metal oxides, leading to improved catalytic performance. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was observed to be influenced by both the loading and the support properties, impacting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP方面的活性和选择性进行了比较。铬氧化物（Cr2O3）被发现显著提高了CO2-ODHP的催化活性，与纯二氧化钒相比。然而，这种改进伴随着CO2生成选择性的下降。研究强调了支持性质的重要性，指出具有更高孔体积的氧化铝促进了金属氧化物的分散，从而提高了催化性能。在支持的Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种的演化被观察到受到负载量和支持性质的影响，影响了整体的催化活性和选择性。
