The study examines the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over vanadia catalysts supported on alumina. The inclusion of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives notably impacts the catalysts' performance. Chromium oxide catalysts, especially those with controlled chromium loading and support properties, exhibit high activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions. The transformation of chromium species within these catalysts depends on the loading and support attributes, affecting the catalyst's overall efficiency.
