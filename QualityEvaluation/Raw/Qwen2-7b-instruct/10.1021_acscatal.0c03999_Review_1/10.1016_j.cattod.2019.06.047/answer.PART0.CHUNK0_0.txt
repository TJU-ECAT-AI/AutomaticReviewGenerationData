The study examined the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over alumina-supported vanadia catalysts, with the addition of CO2 affecting the catalysts' activity and selectivity. Secondary surface metal oxide additives enhanced the catalytic performance. The formation of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was influenced by the loading and support properties.
