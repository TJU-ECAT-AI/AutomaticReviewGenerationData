[1] "The effect of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additive on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was studied over alumina supported vanadia catalyst."
[2] "The addition of carbon dioxide showed a slight increase in the conversion of propane, whereas the addition of metal oxide additives improved both the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."
[3] "The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was found to be influenced by the loading and support properties, with higher loading leading to more Cr3+ formation and better catalytic performance."

The study investigated the impact of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using alumina-supported vanadia catalysts. Carbon dioxide addition marginally enhanced propane conversion, while metal oxide additives augmented both the catalyst's activity and selectivity. The formation of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was observed to depend on the loading and support characteristics; higher loading resulted in increased Cr3+ formation, contributing to superior catalytic performance.
