[1] "The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is a key reaction for the production of propylene, which is a fundamental feedstock for the chemical industry."
[2] "The addition of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the reaction mixture significantly affects the activity and selectivity of the catalyst."
[3] "The use of secondary surface metal oxide additives has been shown to improve the catalytic performance."
[4] "The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by the loading and support properties."

The study examines the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over vanadia catalysts supported on alumina, focusing on the impact of carbon dioxide and secondary surface metal oxide additives on activity and selectivity. The research highlights how the addition of CO2 modifies the catalyst's performance. Secondary metal oxide additives have been found to enhance the catalytic efficiency. The behavior of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is contingent upon the catalyst's loading and support characteristics.
