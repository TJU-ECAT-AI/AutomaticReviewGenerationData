Various metal oxide catalysts, such as supported chromium oxide catalysts, were investigated for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Chromium species evolved differently depending on the loading and support properties. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) was found to be effective for dehydrogenating ethane and acting as an active catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. The acidity/basicity properties of gallium oxide significantly influence its catalytic activity, with supported gallium oxides showing weaker acidity compared to zeolites. The Lewis acid sites of gallium oxide are suspected to be active in the dehydrogenation of ethane. The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process includes improving propane conversion through thermodynamic shifts, lowering the dehydrogenation temperature, and promoting the reaction. The initial promoting effect of carbon dioxide diminishes during the reaction, and potassium addition to gallium oxide leads to a decrease in catalytic activity.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如支持的铬氧化物催化剂，被研究用于CO2辅助的乙烷和丙烷脱氢。铬物种根据负载和支撑性质的不同而发生变化。镓氧化物（Ga2O3）被发现对于乙烷的脱氢和在CO2存在下进行丙烷的氧化脱氢反应是有效的。镓氧化物的酸碱性属性显著影响其催化活性，支持的镓氧化物的酸性比沸石弱。镓氧化物的Lewis酸位点被认为是乙烷脱氢的活性位点。二氧化碳在脱氢过程中的作用包括通过热力学偏移提高丙烷转化率、降低脱氢温度以及促进反应。二氧化碳的初始促进效果在反应过程中减弱，并且向镓氧化物添加钾会导致催化活性下降。
