1. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SiO2 showed exceptional performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide, as reported by Wang et al. [4].
2. Takahara et al. [5] found that carbon dioxide had a promotional effect only on silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts when dehydrogenating propane.
3. Metal-oxide catalysts, particularly gallium oxide (Ga2O3), were found to be effective in dehydrogenating ethane in the presence of CO2, according to Nakagawa et al. [8].

1. 支撑在SiO2上的铬氧化物催化剂在使用二氧化碳进行乙烷的氧化脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能，正如王等人[4]的研究所示。
2. 高田等人[5]发现，当用丙烷脱氢时，只有硅酸盐支撑的铬氧化物催化剂受到二氧化碳的促进作用。
3. 据中川等人[8]的研究，金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是镓氧化物（Ga2O3），在二氧化碳存在下对乙烷脱氢是有效的。
