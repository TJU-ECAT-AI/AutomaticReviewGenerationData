Various metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium oxide (Cr2O3), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), and potassium-promoted gallium oxide (Ga2O3-K), have been evaluated for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide). Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on silica, have shown excellent performance in the presence of carbon dioxide. The Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibit high efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. Similar results were obtained for the dehydrogenation of propane using silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, where carbon dioxide exerted a promoting effect. In contrast, potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts showed a significant loss in catalytic activity. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst led to a decrease in both propane conversion and propene selectivity, possibly due to the blockage of active sites by excess potassium. The activity of potassium-promoted catalysts is notably lower compared to unpromoted catalysts, suggesting that the acidic sites of gallium oxide are the active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate catalyst type and modifying the catalyst properties to optimize the performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如铬氧化物（Cr2O3）、镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和钾促进的镓氧化物（Ga2O3-K），在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中进行了评估。特别是在二氧化碳存在的条件下，铬氧化物催化剂表现出了卓越的性能。Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在乙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢过程中表现出高效率。对于丙烷在硅负载的Cr2O3催化剂上的脱氢反应也获得了相似的结果，碳二氧作用只对二氧化硅负载的Cr2O3催化剂有促进效果。相反，钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂显示出显著的催化活性损失。向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性显著下降，可能是因为过量的钾阻塞了活性位点。钾促进催化剂的活性明显低于未促进的催化剂，这表明镓氧化物的酸性位点是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。结果强调了选择合适的催化剂类型和修改催化剂性质以优化CO2-ODHP反应性能的重要性。
