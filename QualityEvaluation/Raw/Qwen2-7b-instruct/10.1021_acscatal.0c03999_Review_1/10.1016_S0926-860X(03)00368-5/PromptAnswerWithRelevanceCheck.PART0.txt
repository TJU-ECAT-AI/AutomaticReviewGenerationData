<p>It was also calculated that in the presence of CO2 and at a molar ratio CO2/C3H8 = 5, the temperature of dehydrogenation can be 50 K lower than that for the dehydrogenation in the presence of inert gas.</p>
<p>The catalytic activities of the potassium promoted catalysts are much lower than those observed with unpromoted catalyst. The propane conversion and propene selectivity dramatically decrease with increasing K/Ga atomic ratio.</p>
<p>Before reaction, samples of the fresh catalysts were reduced by a pulse of hydrogen or propane.</p>
<p>No significant changes in the diffraction patterns were observed between the diffraction patterns obtained before (Fig. 7a) and after (Fig. 7b) the dehydrogenation of propane under the carbon dioxide flow.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

1. In the presence of CO2 at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the dehydrogenation temperature can be 50 K lower compared to when using inert gas.
2. Potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts show significantly lower catalytic activity compared to unpromoted catalysts. As the K/Ga atomic ratio increases, propane conversion and propene selectivity decrease dramatically.
3. Prior to the reaction, fresh catalyst samples were reduced using pulses of hydrogen or propane.
4. There were no significant changes in the diffraction patterns of the gallium oxide catalysts before and after the propane dehydrogenation process under CO2 flow.
5. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide results in a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction appears to occur on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium-promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

Various metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium oxide (Cr2O3), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), and potassium-promoted gallium oxide (Ga2O3-K), have been evaluated for CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide). Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on silica, have shown excellent performance in the presence of carbon dioxide. The Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibit high efficiency in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. Similar results were obtained for the dehydrogenation of propane using silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts, where carbon dioxide exerted a promoting effect. In contrast, potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts showed a significant loss in catalytic activity. The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide catalyst led to a decrease in both propane conversion and propene selectivity, possibly due to the blockage of active sites by excess potassium. The activity of potassium-promoted catalysts is notably lower compared to unpromoted catalysts, suggesting that the acidic sites of gallium oxide are the active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane. The results highlight the importance of selecting the appropriate catalyst type and modifying the catalyst properties to optimize the performance in CO2-ODHP reactions.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如铬氧化物（Cr2O3）、镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和钾促进的镓氧化物（Ga2O3-K），在二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应中进行了评估。特别是在二氧化碳存在的条件下，铬氧化物催化剂表现出了卓越的性能。Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在乙烷与二氧化碳的氧化脱氢过程中表现出高效率。对于丙烷在硅负载的Cr2O3催化剂上的脱氢反应也获得了相似的结果，碳二氧作用只对二氧化硅负载的Cr2O3催化剂有促进效果。相反，钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂显示出显著的催化活性损失。向镓氧化物催化剂中引入钾导致了丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性显著下降，可能是因为过量的钾阻塞了活性位点。钾促进催化剂的活性明显低于未促进的催化剂，这表明镓氧化物的酸性位点是丙烷脱氢的活性位点。结果强调了选择合适的催化剂类型和修改催化剂性质以优化CO2-ODHP反应性能的重要性。

<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to re- move heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high se- lectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon diox- ide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the prob- lem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The at- tractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for com- mercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydro- genation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent per- formance.</p>
<p>It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide cat- alysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8].</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations [13],propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift (4). Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted to- wards products.</p>

The document discusses various metal oxide catalysts, focusing on chromium oxide catalysts and gallium oxide catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts, specifically Cr2O3/SiO2, show excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The acidity/basicity properties of gallium oxide catalysts significantly affect their catalytic activity, with supported gallium oxides being preferred for NOx reduction due to their weaker acidity compared to zeolites. The Lewis acid sites in gallium oxide are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation. Thermodynamic considerations show that coupling the dehydrogenation reaction with the water-gas shift improves propane conversion. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. Carbon dioxide's role in shifting the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards products is also highlighted.

文档讨论了各种金属氧化物催化剂，重点是铬氧化物催化剂和镓氧化物催化剂。铬氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr2O3/SiO2，在以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。镓氧化物催化剂的酸碱性质对其催化活性有显著影响，支持型镓氧化物在脱除NOx反应中优于沸石，因为它们的酸性较弱。镓氧化物中的Lewis酸位点被怀疑在乙烷脱氢过程中活跃。热力学考虑显示，将脱氢反应与水煤气变换耦合可以提高丙烷转化率。向镓氧化物中引入钾导致催化剂活性损失，表明反应在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。二氧化碳在使脱氢平衡向产物方向移动中起着重要作用。

Various metal oxide catalysts, such as supported chromium oxide catalysts, were investigated for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. Chromium species evolved differently depending on the loading and support properties. Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) was found to be effective for dehydrogenating ethane and acting as an active catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. The acidity/basicity properties of gallium oxide significantly influence its catalytic activity, with supported gallium oxides showing weaker acidity compared to zeolites. The Lewis acid sites of gallium oxide are suspected to be active in the dehydrogenation of ethane. The role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation process includes improving propane conversion through thermodynamic shifts, lowering the dehydrogenation temperature, and promoting the reaction. The initial promoting effect of carbon dioxide diminishes during the reaction, and potassium addition to gallium oxide leads to a decrease in catalytic activity.
