<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. In the presence of CO2 at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the dehydrogenation temperature can be 50 K lower compared to when using inert gas.
2. Potassium-promoted gallium oxide catalysts show significantly lower catalytic activity compared to unpromoted catalysts. As the K/Ga atomic ratio increases, propane conversion and propene selectivity decrease dramatically.
3. Prior to the reaction, fresh catalyst samples were reduced using pulses of hydrogen or propane.
4. There were no significant changes in the diffraction patterns of the gallium oxide catalysts before and after the propane dehydrogenation process under CO2 flow.
5. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide results in a loss of catalytic activity. The reaction appears to occur on acidic sites of the catalyst, as potassium-promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.

1. 在CO2摩尔比为CO2/C3H8=5的情况下，脱氢温度可以比使用惰性气体时低50K。
2. 含钾促进的镓氧化物催化剂的催化活性远低于未促进的催化剂。随着K/Ga原子比的增加，丙烷转化率和丙烯选择性急剧下降。
3. 在反应前，新鲜催化剂样品通过氢或丙烷脉冲进行了还原处理。
4. 在CO2流下进行丙烷脱氢过程前后，镓氧化物催化剂的衍射图样没有显著变化。
5. 向镓氧化物中引入钾导致催化活性的损失。反应似乎在催化剂的酸性位点上进行，因为含钾促进的Ga2O3催化剂并没有表现出高活性。
