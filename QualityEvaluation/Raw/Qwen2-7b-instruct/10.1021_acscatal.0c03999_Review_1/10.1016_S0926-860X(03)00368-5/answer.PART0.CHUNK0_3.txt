<p>The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen has been proposed as an alternative to the thermal cracking [1]. However, due to exothermic characteristic of this reaction, it is necessary to re- move heat and avoid overoxidation of propane to carbon oxides and oxygenates so as to give high se- lectivity towards propene.</p>
<p>In the last decade, the utilisation of carbon diox- ide has received much attention because of its effect on the global warming. A strategy to reduce the prob- lem of further increase of the greenhouse effect is to decrease CO2 concentration in atmosphere. The at- tractive way is to use the carbon dioxide for com- mercial purpose instead of its release to atmosphere.</p>
<p>Wang et al. [4] investigated several supported chromium oxide catalysts in the oxidative dehydro- genation of ethane with carbon dioxide. They found that the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited excellent per- formance.</p>
<p>It is well known that the catalytic activity of gallium oxide cat- alysts is strongly influenced by their acidity/basicity properties. Supported gallium oxides are preferred to zeolites in the de-NOx reaction due to their weaker acidity [12]. On the other hand, the Lewis acid sites are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation [8].</p>
<p>As was shown by thermodynamic considerations [13],propane conversion can be improved by coupling the reaction with the water-gas shift (4). Carbon dioxide consumes hydrogen produced in reaction (3). As the result, the dehydrogenation equilibrium is shifted to- wards products.</p>
<p>The introduction of potassium to the gallium oxide leads to loss of the catalytic activity. The reaction seems to proceed on acidic sites of the catalyst,since potassium promoted Ga2O3 catalysts do not exhibit high activity.</p>

The document discusses various metal oxide catalysts, focusing on chromium oxide catalysts and gallium oxide catalysts. Chromium oxide catalysts, specifically Cr2O3/SiO2, show excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide. The acidity/basicity properties of gallium oxide catalysts significantly affect their catalytic activity, with supported gallium oxides being preferred for NOx reduction due to their weaker acidity compared to zeolites. The Lewis acid sites in gallium oxide are suspected to be active in ethane dehydrogenation. Thermodynamic considerations show that coupling the dehydrogenation reaction with the water-gas shift improves propane conversion. The introduction of potassium to gallium oxide leads to a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting the reaction proceeds on acidic sites of the catalyst. Carbon dioxide's role in shifting the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards products is also highlighted.

文档讨论了各种金属氧化物催化剂，重点是铬氧化物催化剂和镓氧化物催化剂。铬氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr2O3/SiO2，在以二氧化碳为氧化剂的乙烷氧化脱氢反应中表现出优异的性能。镓氧化物催化剂的酸碱性质对其催化活性有显著影响，支持型镓氧化物在脱除NOx反应中优于沸石，因为它们的酸性较弱。镓氧化物中的Lewis酸位点被怀疑在乙烷脱氢过程中活跃。热力学考虑显示，将脱氢反应与水煤气变换耦合可以提高丙烷转化率。向镓氧化物中引入钾导致催化剂活性损失，表明反应在催化剂的酸性位点上进行。二氧化碳在使脱氢平衡向产物方向移动中起着重要作用。
