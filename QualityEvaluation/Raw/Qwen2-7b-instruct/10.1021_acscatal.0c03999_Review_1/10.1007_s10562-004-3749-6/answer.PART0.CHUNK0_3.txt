[1] "The nature of support strongly influences on the effect of CO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was observed on the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, while on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, carbon dioxide did not promote dehydrogenation."
[3] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

Various metal oxide catalysts, specifically chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on different oxide supports, show contrasting performances in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, whereas the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst shows a detrimental impact of CO2 on the yield and selectivity of propene. The observed differences in catalytic activity can be attributed to the influence of the acidic/basic properties of the oxide supports on the chromium species in the supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，在不同的氧化物支持下，对丙烷的CO2辅助脱氢表现出不同的性能。CrOx/SiO2催化剂在CO2作用下促进了丙烯产率，而CrOx/Al2O3催化剂在CO2存在下对丙烯产率和选择性产生了负面影响。观察到的催化活性差异可以归因于氧化物支持对支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的酸性/碱性性质的影响。
