[1] "In all cases the yield of propene increased with temperature, but the detailed behavior varied with a type of support and the feed composition."
[2] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[3] "Over the whole temperature range the yield of propene was higher in the presence of CO2 then its absence."
[4] "On the other hand, over the (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst carbon dioxide exerts an adverse effect on the yield and selectivity of propene."
[5] "The catalytic properties of the supported chromium catalysts are strongly affected by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support."
[6] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

1. The yield of propene increases with temperature, but the specifics vary depending on the catalyst type and feed composition.
2. Carbon dioxide enhances propene yield only on silica-supported catalysts.
3. In the presence of CO2, the yield of propene is consistently higher across the entire temperature range compared to its absence.
4. Carbon dioxide negatively impacts the yield and selectivity of propene on the alumina-supported catalyst.
5. The catalytic properties of chromium oxide-based catalysts are significantly influenced by the acidity/basicity of the oxide support.
6. CO2 and/or steam generated during the reaction modify the acidity/basicity of the alumina-supported catalyst.
