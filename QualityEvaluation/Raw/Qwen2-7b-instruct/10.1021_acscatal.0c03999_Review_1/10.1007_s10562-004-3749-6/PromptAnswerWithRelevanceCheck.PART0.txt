<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study reveals that the nature of the metal oxide support significantly impacts the catalytic performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica (SiO2) exhibit enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2, while those supported on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) show a decrease in propene yield and selectivity when CO2 is present. This suggests that the acidic/basic properties of the support material play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of CO2 in enhancing or inhibiting the dehydrogenation process. The study also indicates that the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is altered during the dehydrogenation with CO2, affecting its catalytic activity.

研究表明，金属氧化物支持的性质对丙烷在二氧化碳存在下的脱氢反应中铬氧化物基催化剂的催化性能有着显著影响。在硅（SiO2）上负载的铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下表现出增强的丙烯产率，而铝（Al2O3）负载的催化剂在二氧化碳存在下则显示出降低的丙烯产率和选择性。这表明支持材料的酸碱性质在决定二氧化碳增强或抑制脱氢过程的有效性方面起着关键作用。研究还指出，在二氧化碳存在的脱氢过程中，CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸碱性发生变化，从而影响其催化活性。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Various metal oxide catalysts, specifically chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on different oxide supports, show contrasting performances in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane. The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibits a promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield, whereas the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst shows a detrimental impact of CO2 on the yield and selectivity of propene. The observed differences in catalytic activity can be attributed to the influence of the acidic/basic properties of the oxide supports on the chromium species in the supported Cr2O3 catalysts.

[3] "The effect of steam on yield and selectivity of propene over (3.4)CrOx/SiO2 and (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts is shown in figure 4. The introduction steam to the reaction zone strongly decreased dehydrogenation activity of the tested catalysts."
[4] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

1. Chromium oxide-based catalysts, specifically those supported on SiO2, showed enhanced propene yield upon the presence of CO2 compared to those supported on Al2O3, where CO2 negatively impacted the yield and selectivity of propene.
2. The introduction of CO2 only promoted propene yield on catalysts supported on silica, suggesting a unique interaction between CO2 and silica that enhances catalytic performance for propene production.
3. Steam significantly reduced the dehydrogenation activity of both (3.4)CrOx/SiO2 and (3.4)CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, and this effect was irreversible for the former and reversible for the latter.
4. CO2 and the steam generated during CO2-assisted dehydrogenation altered the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, affecting its catalytic activity.
5. An increase in chromium loading improved the CO2 resistance of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, whereas it decreased the poisoning effect of CO2 on the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.

1. 在CO2存在下，基于CrOx的催化剂，尤其是那些负载在SiO2上的，表现出增强的丙烯产率，而负载在Al2O3上的催化剂，在CO2的存在下，丙烯的产率和选择性显著降低。
2. 只有在以硅为支持体的催化剂上，CO2才促进了丙烯的产率，表明CO2与硅之间的独特相互作用可以增强催化性能以生产丙烯。
3. 蒸汽显著降低了(3.4)CrOx/SiO2和(3.4)CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的脱氢活性，这种影响对于前者是不可逆的，而对于后者则是可逆的。
4. CO2和在CO2辅助脱氢过程中产生的蒸汽改变了CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸碱性，影响了其催化活性。
5. 铬加载量的增加提高了CrOx/SiO2催化剂对CO2的抵抗力，而它减少了CO2对CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的毒害效应。
