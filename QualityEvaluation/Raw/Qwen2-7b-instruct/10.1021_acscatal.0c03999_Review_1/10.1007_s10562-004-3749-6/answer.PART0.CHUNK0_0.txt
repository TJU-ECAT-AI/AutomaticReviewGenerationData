[1] "It was found that the nature of support strongly effects on the catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation with CO2."
[2] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst CO2 enhance the propene yield, whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst the yield and selectivity of propene in the presence of CO2 strongly decrease."
[3] "The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield was only observed on silica supported catalyst."
[4] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."
[5] "The results obtained prove that the nature of support strongly influences on the effect of CO2 in the dehy- drogenation of propane."

1. The nature of the metal oxide support significantly affects the catalytic performance in CO2-assisted dehydrogenation processes.
2. Chromium oxide-based catalysts supported on silica exhibit enhanced propene yield compared to those on alumina.
3. Carbon dioxide promotes propene yield only on silica-supported catalysts.
4. CO2 and steam alter the acidity/basicity of alumina in the catalyst.
5. The choice of support material has a substantial impact on the CO2 effect in propane dehydrogenation.
