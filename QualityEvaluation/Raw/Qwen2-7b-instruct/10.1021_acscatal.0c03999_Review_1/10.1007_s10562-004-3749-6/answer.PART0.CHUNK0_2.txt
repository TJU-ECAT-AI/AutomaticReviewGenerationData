[1] "The nature of support strongly influences on the effect of CO2 in the dehydronation of propane."
[2] "Over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst with increase of chromium loading the ratio YHe/YCO2 increased whereas over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, with increase in the loading level the poisoning effect of CO2 decreased."
[3] "It seems that CO2 and/or the steam formed during the dehydrogenation with CO2 change the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst."

The study reveals that the nature of the metal oxide support significantly impacts the catalytic performance of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on silica (SiO2) exhibit enhanced propene yield in the presence of CO2, while those supported on aluminum oxide (Al2O3) show a decrease in propene yield and selectivity when CO2 is present. This suggests that the acidic/basic properties of the support material play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of CO2 in enhancing or inhibiting the dehydrogenation process. The study also indicates that the acidity/basicity of the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst is altered during the dehydrogenation with CO2, affecting its catalytic activity.

研究表明，金属氧化物支持的性质对丙烷在二氧化碳存在下的脱氢反应中铬氧化物基催化剂的催化性能有着显著影响。在硅（SiO2）上负载的铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下表现出增强的丙烯产率，而铝（Al2O3）负载的催化剂在二氧化碳存在下则显示出降低的丙烯产率和选择性。这表明支持材料的酸碱性质在决定二氧化碳增强或抑制脱氢过程的有效性方面起着关键作用。研究还指出，在二氧化碳存在的脱氢过程中，CrOx/Al2O3催化剂的酸碱性发生变化，从而影响其催化活性。
