          Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) or SBA-15-supported chromium oxides (CrOx), demonstrate high activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODHP). The reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation. However, the addition of nickel (Ni) as a promoter to these catalysts enhances their stability and selectivity. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activates O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx to active Cr3+ states, contributing to the stable production of propylene. The Ni-promoted catalysts, such as 0.5Ni-Cr/Si and Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15, effectively produce propylene in the ODHP reaction, maintaining high catalytic activity and selectivity.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是支持在SBA-15（Cr/Si）或SBA-15支持的铬氧化物（CrOx）上的催化剂，对于丙烷与二氧化碳（ODHP）的氧化脱氢反应显示出高活性。反应中活性位点（Cr3+）的减少会导致严重的失活。然而，向这些催化剂中添加镍（Ni）作为促进剂可以提高它们的稳定性和选择性。镍促进了CO2的分解为CO和激活氧（O*ads），这使得还原的CrOx再生为活性的Cr3+状态，从而稳定地生产丙烯。添加Ni的催化剂，如0.5Ni-Cr/Si和Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15，有效地在ODHP反应中生产丙烯，保持高催化活性和选择性。

          Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active and represent promising catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODHP). However, the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation. After adding 0.5wt% nickel (Ni) to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity becomes stable, and the selectivity is high. Reduced CrOx can be easily regenerated by Ni, as indicated by a three-step hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction analysis. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction. The main factor causing deactivation in CrOx/silica catalysts is related to the reduction of CrOx species. Both catalysts exhibit similar patterns of Cr species, suggesting that the addition of NiO has minimal impact on the crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase of the catalyst. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is determined through CHNS analysis. To study the effect of Ni on activating CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) typically involves three steps. XPS analyses of Cr6+ face complexity due to its reduction under X-ray radiation. Thus, the focus is on analyzing the presence of active Cr3+ sites, which ensures stable propylene production. In the Cr/Si catalyst, the Cr3+ state converts into an inactive Cr2+ state within 90 seconds during the ODHP reaction. However, in the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained throughout the catalytic reaction. The proposed mechanism for the ODHP reaction with the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst is presented in Scheme 1.

          铬氧化物催化剂支持在SBA-15支撑（Cr/Si）上非常活跃，并代表了氧化脱氢丙烷与二氧化碳（ODHP）的有前景的催化剂。然而，反应中活性位点（Cr3+）的减少会导致严重的失活。在向10wt% Cr/Si（0.5Ni-Cr/Si）添加0.5wt%镍（Ni）后，催化活性变得稳定，选择性高。通过三个步骤的氢温度程序化还原分析，可以轻松再生还原的CrOx。镍促进了CO2的分解为CO和激活氧（O*ads），这再生了还原的CrOx。添加Ni的Cr/Si催化剂增强了丙烯在ODHP反应中的稳定性。CrOx/silica催化剂失活的主要原因是CrOx物种的减少。两种催化剂的Cr物种显示相似模式，表明添加NiO对催化剂的结晶α-Cr2O3相几乎没有显著影响。通过CHNS分析确定催化剂上的焦炭沉积量。为了研究Ni对激活CO2的影响，温度程序化还原（TPR）通常涉及三个步骤。由于Cr6+在X射线辐射下的还原，Cr6+的XPS分析存在解释光谱的复杂性。因此，我们分析了活性Cr3+位点的存在，这可以确保稳定地生产丙烯。在Cr/Si催化剂中，Cr3+状态在90秒内转换成无活性的Cr2+状态。然而，在Ni促进的催化剂中，Cr3+状态在整个催化反应中得到良好维持。用0.5Ni-Cr/Si催化剂提出的ODHP反应机制在方案1中呈现。
