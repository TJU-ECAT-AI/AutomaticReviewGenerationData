          [1] "In the present work catalysts prepared by a new perspective method of metal vapour synthesis were studied in the reaction of propane oxidative dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant."
          [2] "The catalyst with 6.0 wt% demonstrated also the highest catalytic activity with the yield in propene 69%."
          [3] "The use of metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique allows to optimize the system in terms of activity (per Cr atom) and to obtain chromium species highly dispersed on the silica surface up to the high (6.0 wt%) chromium loadings."
          [4] "The catalytic activity should be related to the presence of chromate species of various nuclearities grafted on the silica surface."
          [5] "Chromium loading higher than 6.0 wt% did not result in the further increase of mono-or poly-chromate species but in the appearance on the catalyst surface of the -Cr2O3 particles, not active in the investigated process."
          [6] "The formation of surface chromate species was also accompanied by the appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, and relatively more abundant for higher Cr contents."

          1. Metal oxide catalysts, especially those prepared by a novel method involving metal vapor synthesis, were studied for their activity and selectivity in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface plays a crucial role in their catalytic performance, with the highest activity observed in catalysts loaded with 6.0 wt% chromium. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique optimizes the system in terms of activity per chromium atom, allowing for the preparation of highly dispersed chromium species, even at high loadings. The presence of various chromate species grafted onto the silica surface correlates with catalytic activity. Above 6.0 wt% chromium loading, the formation of inactive -Cr2O3 particles is observed instead of further increasing the dispersion of chromium species. The appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, is also noted, with these sites becoming more abundant at higher chromium contents.

          1. 通过一种新的视角方法，即金属蒸汽合成，研究了用于二氧化碳辅助丙烷氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）反应的金属氧化物催化剂的活性和选择性。二氧化硅表面的铬物种的分散对其催化性能至关重要，其中6.0 wt%铬负载的催化剂表现出最高的活性。金属蒸汽合成（MVS）技术在每克铬原子的活性方面优化了系统性能，使得即使在高负载下也能制备高度分散的铬物种。各种铬酸盐物种在二氧化硅表面的接枝与催化活性相关。超过6.0 wt%的铬负载后，形成了不活跃的-Cr2O3颗粒，而没有进一步增加铬物种的分散。同时，负责焦炭生产的布朗斯特酸中心的出现也被注意到，这些酸中心在较高的铬含量下更为丰富。

          [1] "Catalysts CrSiO2-MVS with Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% exhibited a specific surface area ca. 310 m2/g with a slight decrease of the total pore volume with an increase of the chromium content."
          [2] "For the sake of comparison, the values for the catalysts prepared by wet impregnation method (hereafter: CrSiO2-WI) are also reported [5] (Table 1, Part B)."
          [3] "The catalyst with Cr loading of 10.0 wt% showed a decrease of specific surface area of ca. 20% with a further loss of total pore volume and a sharp decrease of average pore diameter that should result from the filling or blockage of the smallest pores by chromium species."
          [4] "In the bigger fragment of the catalyst the presence of Si is also observed (Fig. 2C)."
          [5] "The presence of these bands is the evidence of oxygen to Cr6+ CT transitions of monochromates, di- and/or polychromates grafted to the SiO2 surface [27a,28]."
          [6] "By increasing the Cr loading from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% (Fig. 3, panel A, curves 15) all mentioned bands progressively increased in intensity and underwent a light shift towards high frequency, but no other band was observed."
          [7] "As concerns propene selectivity its values slightly decrease with an increase of the chromium content (from 87% at 0.25 wt% Cr to 78 at 10.0 wt% Cr)."
          [8] "The results of the long-term tests for the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading are reported in Fig. 5, curves 1."

          2. Catalysts prepared using the metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique, specifically CrSiO2-MVS, with chromium loadings ranging from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, displayed a specific surface area of approximately 310 m2/g, with a slight decrease in total pore volume as the chromium content increased. In comparison, data for catalysts prepared by the wet impregnation method (CrSiO2-WI) are also provided (Table 1, Part B). A catalyst with 10.0 wt% chromium loading experienced a 20% decrease in specific surface area, along with further loss of total pore volume and a significant reduction in average pore diameter, likely due to the blocking of the smallest pores by chromium species. The presence of silicon is also observed in the larger fragments of the catalyst (Fig. 2C). The bands present indicate transitions of monochromates, di-, and/or polychromates grafted to the SiO2 surface (ref. 27a, 28). As the chromium loading increased from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% (Fig. 3, panel A, curves 15), the intensity of all mentioned bands increased gradually, shifting towards higher frequencies, without the emergence of any other band. Propene selectivity values slightly decreased with an increase in chromium content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% chromium to 78% at 10.0 wt% chromium. The long-term test results for the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading are illustrated in Fig. 5, curves 1.

          2. 使用金属蒸汽合成（MVS）技术制备的CrSiO2-MVS催化剂，铬负载范围为0.25至6.0 wt%，显示出大约310 m2/g的比表面积，随着铬含量的增加，总孔体积略有减少。湿浸渍法（CrSiO2-WI）制备的催化剂的数据也一并提供（表1，部分B）。在10.0 wt%铬负载的催化剂中，比表面积减少了约20%，总孔体积进一步损失，平均孔径显著减小，这可能是由于铬物种填充或阻塞了最小的孔。在催化剂的大碎片中也观察到了硅（图2C）。这些带的存在证明了接枝在二氧化硅表面的单铬酸盐、二铬酸盐和/或多铬酸盐的氧到Cr6+ CT过渡（参考27a, 28）。当铬负载从0.25增加到6.0 wt%（图3，面板A，曲线15），所有提到的带的强度逐渐增加，向高频方向轻微移动，但未观察到其他带。随着铬含量的增加，丙烯的选择性值略有下降，从0.25 wt%铬的87%下降到10.0 wt%铬的78%。MVS催化剂0.5 wt%铬负载的长期测试结果在图5，曲线1中展示。
