In the current study, we have synthesized chromium-doped mesoporous silica spheres for use in propane dehydrogenation under CO2 conditions. The impact of chromium addition timing during the sol-gel process was analyzed to gain insights into its effect on catalytic performance. Different metal oxide catalysts were assessed based on their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, and the catalysts' performance was gauged by their capacity to transform propane into propylene when exposed to CO2.
