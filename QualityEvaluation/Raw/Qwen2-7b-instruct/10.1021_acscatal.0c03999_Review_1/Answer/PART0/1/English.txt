Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) or SBA-15-supported chromium oxides (CrOx), demonstrate high activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODHP). The reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation. However, the addition of nickel (Ni) as a promoter to these catalysts enhances their stability and selectivity. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activates O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx to active Cr3+ states, contributing to the stable production of propylene. The Ni-promoted catalysts, such as 0.5Ni-Cr/Si and Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15, effectively produce propylene in the ODHP reaction, maintaining high catalytic activity and selectivity.

The TIE catalysts demonstrated enhanced alkane conversion with increased vanadium content, showing moderate selectivities for C2H4 and C3H6 in the oxidation of C2H6 and C3H8, respectively, with selectivities of about 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C. In contrast, the DHT catalysts exhibited poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (around 60% and 50% with conversion greater than 15% at 550°C, respectively) were achieved in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over DHT catalysts with vanadium content surpassing 1.0 wt%. Additionally, the highest yield of acrolein was 3%, with a selectivity approaching 20%. At low oxygen partial pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the combined selectivities for C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95% and 87%, respectively, with C3H8 conversions of 3.0% and 4.4%, respectively.

1. Metal oxide catalysts, especially those prepared by a novel method involving metal vapor synthesis, were studied for their activity and selectivity in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface plays a crucial role in their catalytic performance, with the highest activity observed in catalysts loaded with 6.0 wt% chromium. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique optimizes the system in terms of activity per chromium atom, allowing for the preparation of highly dispersed chromium species, even at high loadings. The presence of various chromate species grafted onto the silica surface correlates with catalytic activity. Above 6.0 wt% chromium loading, the formation of inactive -Cr2O3 particles is observed instead of further increasing the dispersion of chromium species. The appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, is also noted, with these sites becoming more abundant at higher chromium contents.

Various metal oxide catalysts were tested for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity for producing styrene. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption, and UVvis spectroscopic measurements. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrated high activity in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2, achieving 65% conversion and >90% styrene selectivity.

The Cr-MCM-41-DHT catalyst, specifically with a Si/Cr ratio of 50, demonstrated a propane conversion of 17.0% and a propene yield of 15.9%. Chromium species in the catalyst evolved from tetrahedral coordination to form an active monochromate species, which was reduced to a less active octahedral coordination species during the reaction. Deactivated catalysts were revived through an oxygen treatment, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species. Carbon dioxide could also regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency was lower than that of oxygen.

The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the formation of vanadium oxide species, with monomeric species predominating below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species in the range of 1.2 to 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species at higher loadings. The reducibility of vanadium species varies based on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Large V2O5 crystallites are largely inactive in dehydrogenation processes.

The study explored the role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using Cr/ZrO2 catalysts, focusing on its impact on the yield of olefins through supported Cr2O3 catalysts. It also looked into the potential of using various metal oxides as supports for Cr2O3 to enhance catalytic performance, specifically in the context of the oxidative dehydrogenation process for producing valuable chemicals from hydrocarbons.

The study focuses on the preparation of highly dispersed chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2, aiming to understand the nature of catalytically active chromium sites. This investigation also examines how different metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP), considering factors such as the evolution of chromium species within supported chromium(III) oxide catalysts based on their loading and support properties.

The study focuses on hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 as an innovative catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by the evolution of chromium species within supported Cr2O3 catalysts, which varies based on the loading and support properties.

Various metal oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3, demonstrate activity in CO2-ODHP, with Ga2O3 having the highest C3H6 yield, followed by Fe2O3, Cr2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2. Cr2O3 shows superior performance compared to the other two metal oxides in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. Continuous efforts have been made to understand the factors influencing catalytic performance, with a focus on metal oxide dispersion and support properties. The intrinsic activity of the catalyst is significantly affected by the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, which in turn is determined by the nature of the support.

Various metal oxide catalysts were tested for CO2-ODHP, with Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showing the highest activity and selectivity for producing styrene. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption, and UVvis spectroscopic measurements. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts demonstrated high activity in ethylbenzene dehydrogenation with CO2, achieving 65% conversion and >90% styrene selectivity. It was hypothesized that Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination acted as active monochromate species that were reduced to less active polychromate species in octahedral coordination during the reaction.

Various metal species, including Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co, were tested for their activity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method. Among these, chromium (Cr) on MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, followed by gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co). The Cr-MCM-41-DHT catalyst, specifically with a Si/Cr ratio of 50, demonstrated a propane conversion of 17.0% and a propene yield of 15.9%. Chromium species in the catalyst evolved from tetrahedral coordination to form an active monochromate species, which was reduced to a less active octahedral coordination species during the reaction. Deactivated catalysts were revived through an oxygen treatment, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species. Carbon dioxide could also regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency was lower than that of oxygen.

The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the formation of vanadium oxide species, with monomeric species predominating below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species in the range of 1.2 to 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species at higher loadings. The reducibility of vanadium species varies based on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Large V2O5 crystallites are largely inactive in dehydrogenation processes. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface aids in dispersion and serves as attachment points for vanadium precursors used in catalyst preparation.

Critical literature review indicates that supported vanadium oxide catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane show high activity and selectivity. Various metal oxide catalysts, especially supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3), have been studied for CO2-ODHP. The effectiveness of these catalysts is determined by factors such as metal loading, support properties, and the transformation of metal species during the reaction. For supported Cr2O3 catalysts, their performance is notably influenced by the chromium loading and the nature of the support material.

Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) or SBA-15-supported chromium oxides (CrOx), demonstrate high activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODHP). The reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation. However, the addition of nickel (Ni) as a promoter to these catalysts enhances their stability and selectivity. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activates O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx to active Cr3+ states, contributing to the stable production of propylene. The Ni-promoted catalysts, such as 0.5Ni-Cr/Si and Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15, effectively produce propylene in the ODHP reaction, maintaining high catalytic activity and selectivity.

The TIE catalysts demonstrated enhanced alkane conversion with increased vanadium content, showing moderate selectivities for C2H4 and C3H6 in the oxidation of C2H6 and C3H8, respectively, with selectivities of about 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C. In contrast, the DHT catalysts exhibited poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (around 60% and 50% with conversion greater than 15% at 550°C, respectively) were achieved in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over DHT catalysts with vanadium content surpassing 1.0 wt%. Additionally, the highest yield of acrolein was 3%, with a selectivity approaching 20%. At low oxygen partial pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the combined selectivities for C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95% and 87%, respectively, with C3H8 conversions of 3.0% and 4.4%, respectively.

1. Metal oxide catalysts, especially those prepared by a novel method involving metal vapor synthesis, were studied for their activity and selectivity in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The dispersion of chromium species on the silica surface plays a crucial role in their catalytic performance, with the highest activity observed in catalysts loaded with 6.0 wt% chromium. The metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique optimizes the system in terms of activity per chromium atom, allowing for the preparation of highly dispersed chromium species, even at high loadings. The presence of various chromate species grafted onto the silica surface correlates with catalytic activity. Above 6.0 wt% chromium loading, the formation of inactive -Cr2O3 particles is observed instead of further increasing the dispersion of chromium species. The appearance of Brnsted acid sites, responsible for coke production, is also noted, with these sites becoming more abundant at higher chromium contents.

The study explores how the timing of chromium addition during the sol-gel process affects the performance of chromium-doped mesoporous silica spheres as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It reveals that adding chromium at different stages during the sol-gel process significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP.
