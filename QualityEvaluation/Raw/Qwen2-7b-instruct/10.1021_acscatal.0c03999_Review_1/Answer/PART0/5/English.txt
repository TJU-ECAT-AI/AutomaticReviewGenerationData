This study delves into the influence of chromium addition timing during the sol-gel process on the performance of chromium oxide catalysts, specifically focusing on the effects on the catalytic activity and selectivity of Cr2O3 catalysts. Key determinants of their catalytic performance are the transformation of chromium species, the amount of chromium loaded, and the characteristics of the support material.
