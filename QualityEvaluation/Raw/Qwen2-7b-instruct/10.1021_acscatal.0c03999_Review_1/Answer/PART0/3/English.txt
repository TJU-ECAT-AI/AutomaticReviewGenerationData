This study examines the impact of chromium addition timing during the sol-gel process on the activity and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). It compares the performance of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The key factors determining their catalytic performance are the evolution of chromium species within supported Cr2O3 catalysts, which depends on the catalyst loading and support properties.

The nature of vanadium on the catalyst is significantly influenced by the carrier type, support surface area, metal loading, and vanadium oxidation state. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for a well-dispersed catalyst, as they act as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Acid sites negatively impact catalyst performance, promoting cracking and coke formation. Wu et al. noted that monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species are present between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominate at higher loadings.
