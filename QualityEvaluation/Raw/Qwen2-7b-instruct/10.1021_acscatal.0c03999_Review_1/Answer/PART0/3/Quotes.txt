          [2] "The study investigates the effect of Cr adding time in the sol-gel process on the activity and selectivity of Cr2O3 catalysts."
          [3] "Various metal oxide catalysts were compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP (Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane)."
          [4] "Key factors influencing the catalytic performance include the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties."

[1] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201)"
          [2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation."
          [3] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
