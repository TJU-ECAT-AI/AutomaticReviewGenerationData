However, the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation. After adding 0.5wt% nickel (Ni) to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity becomes stable, and the selectivity is high. Reduced CrOx can be easily regenerated by Ni, as indicated by a three-step hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction analysis. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction. The main factor causing deactivation in CrOx/silica catalysts is related to the reduction of CrOx species. Both catalysts exhibit similar patterns of Cr species, suggesting that the addition of NiO has minimal impact on the crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase of the catalyst. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is determined through CHNS analysis. To study the effect of Ni on activating CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) typically involves three steps. XPS analyses of Cr6+ face complexity due to its reduction under X-ray radiation. Thus, the focus is on analyzing the presence of active Cr3+ sites, which ensures stable propylene production. In the Cr/Si catalyst, the Cr3+ state converts into an inactive Cr2+ state within 90 seconds during the ODHP reaction. However, in the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained throughout the catalytic reaction.

Both catalysts exhibit similar patterns of Cr species, suggesting that the addition of NiO has minimal impact on the crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase of the catalyst. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is determined through CHNS analysis. To study the effect of Ni on activating CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) typically involves three steps. XPS analyses of Cr6+ face complexity due to its reduction under X-ray radiation. Thus, the focus is on analyzing the presence of active Cr3+ sites, which ensures stable propylene production. In the Cr/Si catalyst, the Cr3+ state converts into an inactive Cr2+ state within 90 seconds during the ODHP reaction. However, in the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained throughout the catalytic reaction. The proposed mechanism for the ODHP reaction with the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst is presented in Scheme 1.", "Doi": "10.1002/cctc.201200397"},

After adding 0.5wt% nickel (Ni) to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity becomes stable, and the selectivity is high. Reduced CrOx can be easily regenerated by Ni, as indicated by a three-step hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction analysis. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction. The main factor causing deactivation in CrOx/silica catalysts is related to the reduction of CrOx species.

The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is determined through CHNS analysis. To study the effect of Ni on activating CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) typically involves three steps.

Currently, the US obtains approximately a quarter of its natural gas production from shale gas deposits, with this proportion expected to increase further in the coming years due to the focus on achieving energy independence. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced through targeted methods, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the majority of propylene production.", "Doi": "10.1021/cr5002436"},
{"Quotes": "No relevant quotes", "English": "There are no specific quotes provided in the document regarding the comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, their activity and selectivity, or the factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on a critical review of the kinetics for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, but does not extensively discuss other metal oxides such as chromium oxide (Cr2O3) or provide detailed analysis of their properties.", "Doi": "10.1021/cs5003417"},
