Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active and represent promising catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODHP). However, the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation. After adding 0.5wt% nickel (Ni) to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity becomes stable, and the selectivity is high. Reduced CrOx can be easily regenerated by Ni, as indicated by a three-step hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction analysis. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction. The main factor causing deactivation in CrOx/silica catalysts is related to the reduction of CrOx species. Both catalysts exhibit similar patterns of Cr species, suggesting that the addition of NiO has minimal impact on the crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase of the catalyst. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is determined through CHNS analysis. To study the effect of Ni on activating CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) typically involves three steps. XPS analyses of Cr6+ face complexity due to its reduction under X-ray radiation. Thus, the focus is on analyzing the presence of active Cr3+ sites, which ensures stable propylene production. In the Cr/Si catalyst, the Cr3+ state converts into an inactive Cr2+ state within 90 seconds during the ODHP reaction. However, in the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained throughout the catalytic reaction. The proposed mechanism for the ODHP reaction with the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst is presented in Scheme 1.

Vanadium species introduced via the template-ion exchange method were predominantly found on the wall of MCM-41 in a monomeric tetrahedral coordination, whereas those from the direct hydrothermal method were incorporated into the framework of MCM-41. In the TIE method, vanadium species were mainly distributed on the wall of MCM-41. When vanadium was introduced to MCM-41 through the DHT method, there was an increase in alkane conversion, but this decrease was noted as the vanadium content grew high. The DHT catalysts displayed low selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. Moreover, it is hypothesized that acrolein is formed via the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the medium-strength acid sites in the catalyst are believed to participate in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, thus facilitating the formation of acrolein.

2. Catalysts prepared using the metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique, specifically CrSiO2-MVS, with chromium loadings ranging from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, displayed a specific surface area of approximately 310 m2/g, with a slight decrease in total pore volume as the chromium content increased. In comparison, data for catalysts prepared by the wet impregnation method (CrSiO2-WI) are also provided (Table 1, Part B). A catalyst with 10.0 wt% chromium loading experienced a 20% decrease in specific surface area, along with further loss of total pore volume and a significant reduction in average pore diameter, likely due to the blocking of the smallest pores by chromium species. The presence of silicon is also observed in the larger fragments of the catalyst (Fig. 2C). The bands present indicate transitions of monochromates, di-, and/or polychromates grafted to the SiO2 surface (ref. 27a, 28). As the chromium loading increased from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% (Fig. 3, panel A, curves 15), the intensity of all mentioned bands increased gradually, shifting towards higher frequencies, without the emergence of any other band. Propene selectivity values slightly decreased with an increase in chromium content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% chromium to 78% at 10.0 wt% chromium. The long-term test results for the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading are illustrated in Fig. 5, curves 1.

The investigation explores the effect of chromium addition timing during the sol-gel process on the catalytic performance of chromium oxide catalysts, specifically in the context of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The study reveals that the performance of the Cr2O3 catalyst is notably affected by the timing of chromium addition. Moreover, the evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalyst is contingent upon the loading and support properties.

Different metal oxide catalysts were evaluated for their effectiveness in CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP), highlighting the impact of chromium species evolution in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, which depends on the loading and support properties. It was noted that the surface chromium species are vital for catalytic performance, and the loading of chromium along with the characteristics of the zirconia support greatly affected the catalytic activity and selectivity, showing an improvement in CO2 production activity and selectivity with an increase in chromium loading.

The study focuses on the preparation of highly dispersed chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2, exploring the nature of catalytically active chromium sites. It further highlights the importance of understanding how the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts changes based on the loading and support properties.

The hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The catalyst's performance is influenced by its characterization through XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. High activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP were observed, which depends on the loading of Cr2O3 and the properties of the support ZrO2. The evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalyst was studied as a function of loading and support properties, contributing to its catalytic performance.

For all freshly prepared catalysts, Cr(VI) is present in the forms of mono-, di-, and poly-chromates, while Cr(III) only exists as α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings (3.0 wt. % or more). The redox cycle, as illustrated in Figure 4, demonstrates a clear relationship between C3H6 yield and the number of redox sites, validating the critical role of redox Cr species in achieving high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP. In an early study by Ge et al., the exceptional activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 was confirmed through comparative tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2).

Similar to the first question, this question focuses on the comparison of various metal oxide catalysts, with chromium (Cr) on MCM-41-DHT showing the highest activity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane. The Cr-MCM-41 catalyst displayed a 30% conversion rate and selectivity greater than 90% for propene production. The chromium species evolved from tetrahedral coordination to an active monochromate species, which was reduced to a less active octahedral coordination species. Deactivated catalysts were revived through an oxygen treatment, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species. The regeneration process also involved the observation of a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species.

Demand for building blocks has consistently grown over the past years, with most major markets experiencing positive growth in demand and production, except for the Eurozone, due to recent economic downturn effects. Currently, the US obtains approximately a quarter of its natural gas production from shale gas deposits, with this proportion expected to increase further in the coming years due to the focus on achieving energy independence. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced through targeted methods, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the majority of propylene production.

There are no specific quotes provided in the document regarding the comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, their activity and selectivity, or the factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on a critical review of the kinetics for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, but does not extensively discuss other metal oxides such as chromium oxide (Cr2O3) or provide detailed analysis of their properties.

Vanadium species introduced via the template-ion exchange method were predominantly found on the wall of MCM-41 in a monomeric tetrahedral coordination, whereas those from the direct hydrothermal method were incorporated into the framework of MCM-41. In the TIE method, vanadium species were mainly distributed on the wall of MCM-41. When vanadium was introduced to MCM-41 through the DHT method, there was an increase in alkane conversion, but this decrease was noted as the vanadium content grew high. The DHT catalysts displayed low selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. Moreover, it is hypothesized that acrolein is formed via the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the medium-strength acid sites in the catalyst are believed to participate in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, thus facilitating the formation of acrolein.

2. Catalysts prepared using the metal vapor synthesis (MVS) technique, specifically CrSiO2-MVS, with chromium loadings ranging from 0.25 to 6.0 wt%, displayed a specific surface area of approximately 310 m2/g, with a slight decrease in total pore volume as the chromium content increased. In comparison, data for catalysts prepared by the wet impregnation method (CrSiO2-WI) are also provided (Table 1, Part B). A catalyst with 10.0 wt% chromium loading experienced a 20% decrease in specific surface area, along with further loss of total pore volume and a significant reduction in average pore diameter, likely due to the blocking of the smallest pores by chromium species. The presence of silicon is also observed in the larger fragments of the catalyst (Fig. 2C). The bands present indicate transitions of monochromates, di-, and/or polychromates grafted to the SiO2 surface (ref. 27a, 28). As the chromium loading increased from 0.25 to 6.0 wt% (Fig. 3, panel A, curves 15), the intensity of all mentioned bands increased gradually, shifting towards higher frequencies, without the emergence of any other band. Propene selectivity values slightly decreased with an increase in chromium content, from 87% at 0.25 wt% chromium to 78% at 10.0 wt% chromium. The long-term test results for the MVS catalyst with 0.5 wt% chromium loading are illustrated in Fig. 5, curves 1.

The investigation explores the effect of chromium addition timing during the sol-gel process on the catalytic performance of chromium oxide catalysts, specifically in the context of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The study reveals that the performance of the Cr2O3 catalyst is notably affected by the timing of chromium addition. Moreover, the evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalyst is contingent upon the loading and support properties.

Different metal oxide catalysts were evaluated for their effectiveness in CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP), highlighting the impact of chromium species evolution in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, which depends on the loading and support properties. It was noted that the surface chromium species are vital for catalytic performance, and the loading of chromium along with the characteristics of the zirconia support greatly affected the catalytic activity and selectivity, showing an improvement in CO2 production activity and selectivity with an increase in chromium loading.

The study focuses on the preparation of highly dispersed chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2, exploring the nature of catalytically active chromium sites. It further highlights the importance of understanding how the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts changes based on the loading and support properties.

The hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 catalyst demonstrated high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The catalyst's performance is influenced by its characterization through XRD, TEM, and N2 adsorption-desorption techniques. High activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP were observed, which depends on the loading of Cr2O3 and the properties of the support ZrO2. The evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalyst was studied as a function of loading and support properties, contributing to its catalytic performance.

For all freshly prepared catalysts, Cr(VI) is present in the forms of mono-, di-, and poly-chromates, while Cr(III) only exists as α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings (3.0 wt. % or more). The redox cycle, as illustrated in Figure 4, demonstrates a clear relationship between C3H6 yield and the number of redox sites, validating the critical role of redox Cr species in achieving high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP. In an early study by Ge et al., the exceptional activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 was confirmed through comparative tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2).

Similar to the first question, this question focuses on the comparison of various metal oxide catalysts, with chromium (Cr) on MCM-41-DHT showing the highest activity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane. The Cr-MCM-41 catalyst displayed a 30% conversion rate and selectivity greater than 90% for propene production. The chromium species evolved from tetrahedral coordination to an active monochromate species, which was reduced to a less active octahedral coordination species. Deactivated catalysts were revived through an oxygen treatment, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species. The regeneration process also involved the observation of a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species.

Demand for building blocks has consistently grown over the past years, with most major markets experiencing positive growth in demand and production, except for the Eurozone, due to recent economic downturn effects. Currently, the US obtains approximately a quarter of its natural gas production from shale gas deposits, with this proportion expected to increase further in the coming years due to the focus on achieving energy independence. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced through targeted methods, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the majority of propylene production.

There are no specific quotes provided in the document regarding the comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, their activity and selectivity, or the factors influencing their catalytic performance. The document focuses on a critical review of the kinetics for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over well-defined supported vanadium oxide catalysts, but does not extensively discuss other metal oxides such as chromium oxide (Cr2O3) or provide detailed analysis of their properties.

Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active and represent promising catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide (ODHP). However, the reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation. After adding 0.5wt% nickel (Ni) to 10wt% Cr/Si (0.5Ni-Cr/Si), the catalytic activity becomes stable, and the selectivity is high. Reduced CrOx can be easily regenerated by Ni, as indicated by a three-step hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction analysis. Nickel promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction. The main factor causing deactivation in CrOx/silica catalysts is related to the reduction of CrOx species. Both catalysts exhibit similar patterns of Cr species, suggesting that the addition of NiO has minimal impact on the crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase of the catalyst. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is determined through CHNS analysis. To study the effect of Ni on activating CO2, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) typically involves three steps. XPS analyses of Cr6+ face complexity due to its reduction under X-ray radiation. Thus, the focus is on analyzing the presence of active Cr3+ sites, which ensures stable propylene production. In the Cr/Si catalyst, the Cr3+ state converts into an inactive Cr2+ state within 90 seconds during the ODHP reaction. However, in the Ni-promoted catalyst, the Cr3+ state is well maintained throughout the catalytic reaction. The proposed mechanism for the ODHP reaction with the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst is presented in Scheme 1.
