                    Comprehensive analysis of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals their varied performance influenced by metal loading, support properties, and the evolution of metal species. Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are noted for their high activity and selectivity in propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) also stands out, showing catalytic performance influenced by chromium loading and support characteristics. The study emphasizes the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, highlighting its critical role in determining intrinsic activity. Various metal oxides, including Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3, exhibit distinct activity profiles, with Cr2O3 performing best in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. The nature of the support is pivotal, affecting the dispersion and evolution of metal species, thereby influencing intrinsic activity. Metal vapor synthesis (MVS) techniques enable optimized systems with high activity per chromium atom, achieved through the efficient presence of chromate species. Continuous efforts aim to clarify the relationship between catalytic performance and essential factors, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion and support properties. The support's nature significantly impacts the dispersion and evolution of chromium species, thus determining intrinsic activity. The hydrothermally prepared Cr2O3-ZrO2 catalysts showcase efficient dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, with performance influenced by the evolution of chromium species as a function of loading and support properties. This insight underscores the importance of tailored catalyst design for optimized CO2-ODHP processes.
