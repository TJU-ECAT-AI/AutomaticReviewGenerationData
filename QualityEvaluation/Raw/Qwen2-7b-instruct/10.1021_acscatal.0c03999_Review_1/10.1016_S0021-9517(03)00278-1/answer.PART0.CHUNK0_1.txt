1. Different types of chromium species, including monochromates, polychromates, and aggregated chromium oxides, have been identified on various samples. Various analytical techniques such as ESR, UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XPS, XANES, and TPR have been utilized to investigate chromium's oxidation state and coordination structure.

2. The oxidation state of chromium and its coordination structure over supported chromium oxides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been studied using a range of methods. These include Electron Spin Resonance (ESR), Ultraviolet-visible (UVvis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES), and Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR).

3. The impregnation method for synthesizing Cr-MCM-41 led to low selectivity for propylene (18.4%) and a low propylene yield (less than 5%) during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen.

4. Two distinct methods, direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE), were employed to synthesize various materials including V-, Fe-, and Mn-MCM-41. These methods resulted in differing metal ion locations and coordination environments within the materials.

5. Despite numerous studies linking catalytic properties to coordination structures of supported chromium oxides, further research is required to understand the relationship between structure and properties in Cr-containing mesoporous molecular sieve systems across different reaction types.
