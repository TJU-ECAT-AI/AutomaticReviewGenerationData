1. Various metal oxide catalysts differ in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP based on their unique compositions and structures. Factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the metal, its oxidation state, the coordination environment, and the support material's properties. In the context of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a crucial role in determining activity and selectivity. As chromium loading increases, the coordination structure changes, affecting the catalyst's performance.

2. The key factors influencing catalytic performance in metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP include the metal's oxidation state, coordination structure, and the properties of the support material. The structure-property relationship between the catalyst's composition and its catalytic behavior is essential for understanding and optimizing its performance. The study of chromium species in Cr-MCM-41 synthesized via direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods provides insights into how these factors affect the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation and partial oxidation reactions.

To compare how various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts, perform in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP (Oxygenated Diesel Hydroprocessing Process), the key factors influencing their catalytic performance are chromium species evolution and their distribution on the support material. The direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods lead to different chromium species and coordination environments. The DHT method tends to incorporate chromium ions inside the framework of MCM-41, resulting in more dispersed chromium species, while the TIE method places chromium ions on the wall surface of MCM-41 within the mesopores. This difference in dispersion affects the selectivity and activity in reactions such as the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen. The study highlights that the structure-property relationship between chromium species and the support material plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic performance of Cr-MCM-41 catalysts.

对于在CO2-ODHP（氧化的柴油加氢处理过程）中，各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂的活性和选择性进行比较时，影响其催化性能的关键因素是铬物种的演化及其在支持材料上的分布。直接水热合成（DHT）和模板离子交换（TIE）方法导致不同的铬物种和配位环境。DHT方法倾向于将铬离子嵌入MCM-41的框架内，产生更分散的铬物种，而TIE方法则将铬离子放置在MCM-41的壁表面内部的介孔内。这种分散度的不同影响了丙烷脱氢反应和甲烷部分氧化反应的活性和选择性。研究表明，铬物种与支撑材料之间的结构-性质关系对Cr-MCM-41催化剂的催化性能具有决定性作用。
