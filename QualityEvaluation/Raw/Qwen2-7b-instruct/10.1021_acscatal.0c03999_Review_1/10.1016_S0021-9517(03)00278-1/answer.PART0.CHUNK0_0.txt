<p>The oxidation state of chromium and the coordination structure of chromium species over supported chromium oxides and Cr-containing molecular sieves have been investigated by various techniques such as ESR [28], UVvis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy [29], XPS [30], XANES [21,31], and TPR [32]. Several types of chromium species,e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chrom- ium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples.</p>
<p>It can be expected that different synthetic methods would result in different chromium species and the different chromium species may behave differently in catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>In the present paper, we report the synthesis of Cr-MCM-41 using the TIE and the DHT methods. The synthesized materials are characterized in detail to gain information about the structures of the introduced chromium species.</p>
<p>Two kinds of catalytic reactions, viz., the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide and the partial oxidation of methane with oxygen are investigated and compared to elu- cidate the structure-property relationships for the two types of Cr-MCM-41.</p>

1. Various metal oxide catalysts differ in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP based on their unique compositions and structures. Factors influencing catalytic performance include the nature of the metal, its oxidation state, the coordination environment, and the support material's properties. In the context of supported Cr2O3 catalysts, the evolution of chromium species plays a crucial role in determining activity and selectivity. As chromium loading increases, the coordination structure changes, affecting the catalyst's performance.

2. The key factors influencing catalytic performance in metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP include the metal's oxidation state, coordination structure, and the properties of the support material. The structure-property relationship between the catalyst's composition and its catalytic behavior is essential for understanding and optimizing its performance. The study of chromium species in Cr-MCM-41 synthesized via direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods provides insights into how these factors affect the catalyst's performance in dehydrogenation and partial oxidation reactions.
