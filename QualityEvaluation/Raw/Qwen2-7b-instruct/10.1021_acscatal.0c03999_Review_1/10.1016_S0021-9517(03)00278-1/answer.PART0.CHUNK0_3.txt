[1] "Chromium-based catalysts have received much attention because of their wide use in many catalytic reactions [1,2]."
[2] "Silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were industrially used for the production of polyethylene (Phillips catalyst) [3,4] and lower alkenes such as propylene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes [5,6], respectively."
[3] "Carbon dioxide was found to enhance the dehydrogenation of propane [7] or ethane [8,9] over silica-supported chromium oxide."
[4] "Supported chromium oxides have also been investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [1013] or oxidation of other organic compounds with oxygen [14,15]."
[5] "There exist several studies on the syntheses and characterizations of Cr-MCM-41 [1621]."
[6] "Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method was once used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen, but the selectivity to propylene was low (18.4% at 12.4% propane conversion) and the yield to propylene was lower than 5% [20]."
[7] "Recently, a SBA-15-supported chromium oxide by the impregnation method has been applied to the dehydrogenation and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and showed good catalytic performance [27]."
[8] "Several types of chromium species, e.g., monochromate, polychromate, and aggregated chromium oxide have been reported to exist on these samples."
[9] "It can be expected that different synthetic methods would result in different chromium species and the different chromium species may behave differently in catalytic reactions."
[10] "In the present paper, we report the synthesis of Cr-MCM-41 using the TIE and the DHT methods. The synthesized materials are characterized in detail to gain information about the structures of the introduced chromium species."

The document discusses the utilization of chromium-based catalysts in various industrial applications, including polyethylene production, dehydrogenation of alkanes, and oxidation of organic compounds. Different synthetic methods, such as direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE), affect the type and dispersion of chromium species on the catalysts, impacting their catalytic performance in specific reactions. The study aims to characterize Cr-MCM-41 synthesized through these methods to understand the relationship between the structure of chromium species and their catalytic properties in dehydrogenation and partial oxidation processes.
