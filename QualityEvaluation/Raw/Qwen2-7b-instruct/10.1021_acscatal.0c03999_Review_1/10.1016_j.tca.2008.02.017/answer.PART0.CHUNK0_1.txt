[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter. Inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM- 41, SBA-15, MSU-x) and carbonaceous materials (diamond, active carbon) were tested as the supports."
[2] "It was found that the best results were achieved over the sample containing about 5 wt.% of Cr. A negative effect of activity decay with time-on-stream was found."
[3] "The reasons of the observed deactivation were explained using the thermal analysis method. A behavior of the fresh and used samples was tested in a temperature range of 251000 C in different atmospheres (inert gas, air or CO2)."
[4] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac- tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample."
[5] "An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide."
[6] "It was found that when the propane conversion increases, a decrease in the propene selectivity is observed."
[7] "The nature and size of pores were not essentially changed after the modification with chromium oxide."
[8] "The studied catalysts undergo a fast deactivation with time-on-stream."
[9] "The presence of carbon dioxide in the feed partially protects the active carbon-based catalysts against deactivation."
[10] "Evidently, CrOx present in the samples is a catalytically active phase in carbon gasification."

1. A variety of catalysts, including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, Zn, SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x, diamond, and active carbon, were tested for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
2. The highest catalytic activity was observed with a Cr content of around 5 wt.%, while higher Cr loadings led to a decrease in activity.
3. The deactivation of the catalysts was studied through thermal analysis.
4. The diffraction lines at 33.5, 36.1, and 54.82 indicate the presence of a crystalline phase of Cr2O3 in the Cr(10.0)/AC sample.
5. Increasing the Cr loading leads to the formation of a crystalline Cr2O3 phase.
6. As propane conversion increases, there is a decrease in propene selectivity.
7. The pore structure of the catalysts was not significantly altered by Cr modification.
8. The active carbon-based catalysts experienced rapid deactivation over time.
9. CO2 in the feed helps protect the catalysts from deactivation.
10. CrOx in the samples acts as an active phase in carbon gasification.

2. 最佳结果出现在Cr含量约为5 wt.%的样品中。更高的Cr负载导致活性下降。
3. 通过热分析研究了催化剂的失活原因。
4. Cr(10.0)/AC样品中的33.5、36.1和54.82度的衍射线表明存在结晶Cr2O3相。
5. 增加Cr负载导致Cr2O3结晶相的形成。
6. 随着丙烷转化率的增加，丙烯选择性降低。
7. Cr修改后，催化剂的孔结构没有显著改变。
8. 活性碳基催化剂经历了快速失活。
9. CO2在流体中有助于保护催化剂免于失活。
