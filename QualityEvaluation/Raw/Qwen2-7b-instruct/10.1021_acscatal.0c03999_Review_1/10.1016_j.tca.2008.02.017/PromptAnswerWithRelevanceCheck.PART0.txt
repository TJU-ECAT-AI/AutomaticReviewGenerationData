[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."
[2] "Inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) and carbonaceous materials (diamond, active carbon) were tested as the supports."
[3] "The optimal catalyst composition was determined for the reac- tion performed at a thermodynamically reasonable temperature of 600 C. An influence of the Cr loading on the initial propane conversion and the products selectivity is demonstrated in Fig. 3A and B, respectively."
[4] "It was found that when the propane conversion increases, a decrease in the propene selectivity is observed."
[5] "An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower temperatures."
[6] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C. Moreover, a difference in stability between the samples used in the inert and CO2 atmosphere can be distinguished."

1. A wide range of catalysts, including different metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, Zn) and various inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x), and carbon materials (diamond, active carbon) were evaluated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation.
2. Chromium oxide supported on active carbon showed exceptional activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The optimal loading was around 5 wt.%, and higher loads led to the formation of crystalline Cr2O3, which negatively impacted activity due to pore blockage.
3. As the propane conversion increased, the propene selectivity decreased.
4. The presence of chromium on the active carbon surface led to a shift in the oxidation process to lower temperatures.
5. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst began to be oxidized at 310 C during the reaction, showing differences in stability between inert and CO2 atmospheres.

<p>The calcined AC based samples modified with chromium were studied by XRD. The recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1. It should be noticed that the catalysts containing a relatively small amount of Cr exhibit rather amorphous nature. An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide.</p>
<p>Table 1 Textural parameters of the studied active carbon-based catalysts Sample BET surface area (m2/g) Langmuir surface area (m2/g) t-Plot micropore volume (cm3/g)</p>
<p>For the samples containing Cr (not shown), submicropores still play a dominant role. On the other hand, the specific surface area determined formally using the BET or Langmuir equation decreases with raising the Cr loading (Table 1).</p>
<p>It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14].</p>
<p>The rate of activity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane,ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6. It is observed that the deactivation is faster in the CO2-rich atmosphere compared to inert one.</p>
<p>The DTG curves recorded for the active carbon-based catalysts in the argon atmosphere (measurement conditions: sample 0.025 g; Ar flow rate = 80 ml/min;temperature range = 301000 C, heating rate = 10 C/min).</p>
<p>Similar DTG profiles were recorded for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in the catalytic runs. It should, however, be noticed that the decom- position of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the course of the propane dehydrogenation stabilized slightly the carbonaceous support.</p>
<p>Finally, the interaction between CO2 and the active carbon- based samples was studied by TG. The resulting DTG profiles are shown in Fig. 9. It should be noticed that CO2 is much less effective oxidizing agent compared to air.</p>

1. Chromium oxide catalysts show varying levels of activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. The Cr loading significantly influences their performance. A catalyst with a Cr content around 5% demonstrates the highest propane conversion efficiency. As the Cr loading increases, the formation of a crystalline -Cr2O3 phase occurs, which partially blocks micropores and decreases catalytic activity.
2. The specific surface area and micropore volume of the active carbon-based catalysts decrease with increasing Cr loading. This is because the chromium oxide species tend to deposit primarily on the external surface of the active carbon support, partially blocking the micropores.
3. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity compared to other catalysts previously studied for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The deactivation rate is notably faster in a CO2-rich atmosphere than in an inert one.
4. Thermal analysis reveals that the active carbon support contains carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species that play a role in the catalytic process. These species' concentration gradually decreases after the catalytic run. Simultaneously, inactive coke forms on the catalyst surface during the propane dehydrogenation.
5. Carbon dioxide acts as a less effective oxidizing agent than air in the interaction with the active carbon-based samples. Its role in the gasification of the active carbon support is minimal under the conditions used during the catalytic process.

1. 铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的活性和选择性存在差异。铬含量显著影响其性能。含铬量约5%的催化剂表现出最高的丙烷转化效率。随着铬含量的增加，会形成结晶的- Cr2O3相，这会部分阻塞微孔并降低催化活性。
2. 活性碳基催化剂的比表面积和微孔体积随铬负载的增加而减少。这是因为铬氧化物物种倾向于主要沉积在外表面活性碳支持上，部分阻塞微孔。
3. Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在CO2存在下的活性显著高于之前研究中其他催化剂的活性。在富含CO2的气氛下，催化剂的失活速率明显快于惰性气氛。
4. 热分析显示，活性碳支持包含在催化过程中起作用的羰基-和羧基类表面物种。这些物种的浓度在催化运行后逐渐减少。同时，在丙烷脱氢过程中，在催化剂表面上形成了无活性焦炭。
5. 二氧化碳在与活性碳基样品的相互作用中作为比空气更不有效的氧化剂。在催化过程使用的条件下，其对活性碳支持的气化作用很小。

[1] "Active carbon appeared to be a very promising candidate for a support of alkane dehydrogenation catalysts as well."
[2] "Their catalytic performance was tested in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[3] "However, conversion of propane to propene via the direct dehydrogenation route is even more important research subject."
[4] "Propene is a very important raw material used as a feedstock for variety of chemical intermediates and polymers."
[5] "In the new process, propene is obtained with higher yield than in the traditional one."
[6] "This promoting effect of CO2 is explained by its participation in:(1) direct oxidation of propane to propene"
[7] "An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide."
[8] "A similar effect was found for the micropore volume calculated according to the t-plot method."
[9] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffraction lines at about 33.5, 36.1 and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample."

1. Active carbon is considered a promising support for alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, with its performance tested in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide. Propane to propene conversion via direct dehydrogenation is a more critical research topic, as propene is essential for various chemical intermediates and polymers. In the novel process, propene is produced with higher yield compared to traditional methods. Carbon dioxide's promoting effect on propane dehydrogenation is explained by its involvement in direct oxidation of propane to propene.

2. Increasing the chromium loading leads to the formation of a crystalline phase of chromium oxide. This change affects the micropore volume, as evident from calculations using the t-plot method.

3. The distinct diffraction lines at approximately 33.5, 36.1, and 54.82 are indicative of the presence of rhombohedral -Cr2O3 in the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. Chromium oxide species are primarily deposited on the external surface of the active carbon support.

4. The introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface shifts the oxidation process to lower temperatures, indicating that CrOx acts as an active phase in carbon gasification. 

5. There is a noticeable difference in stability between samples used in inert and carbon dioxide atmospheres, suggesting that the presence of carbon dioxide stabilizes the active carbon support.

1. 活性碳被认为是一种有前景的烷烃脱氢催化剂载体，其性能在存在二氧化碳的情况下被测试用于乙苯和异丁烷的脱氢。通过直接脱氢途径将丙烷转化为丙烯是更关键的研究课题，因为丙烯是各种中间体和聚合物的原料。在新过程中，与传统方法相比，丙烯的产量更高。二氧化碳促进丙烷脱氢的作用通过其直接氧化丙烷生成丙烯来解释。

2. 增加铬负载导致铬氧化物相的结晶化。这种变化影响微孔体积，如通过t-图法计算得出。

3. 大约33.5、36.1和54.82的特征衍射线表明Cr(10.0)/AC样品中存在rhombohedral -Cr2O3。铬氧化物种主要沉积在活性碳支持物的外部表面。

4. 在活性碳表面引入铬导致氧化过程向较低温度偏移，这表明CrOx是碳气化的活性相。

5. 使用惰性和二氧化碳气氛的样品之间存在明显的稳定性差异，这表明二氧化碳稳定了活性碳支持物。
