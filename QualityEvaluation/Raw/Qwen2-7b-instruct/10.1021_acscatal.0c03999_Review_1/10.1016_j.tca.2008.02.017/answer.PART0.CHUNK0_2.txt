<p>The calcined AC based samples modified with chromium were studied by XRD. The recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1. It should be noticed that the catalysts containing a relatively small amount of Cr exhibit rather amorphous nature. An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide.</p>
<p>Table 1 Textural parameters of the studied active carbon-based catalysts Sample BET surface area (m2/g) Langmuir surface area (m2/g) t-Plot micropore volume (cm3/g)</p>
<p>For the samples containing Cr (not shown), submicropores still play a dominant role. On the other hand, the specific surface area determined formally using the BET or Langmuir equation decreases with raising the Cr loading (Table 1).</p>
<p>It should be stressed that the activity observed for the Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst is indeed very high compared to other catalysts previously studied in the propane dehydrogenation with CO2 [10,14].</p>
<p>The rate of activity loss expressed in term of relative yield of cracking (methane,ethylene and ethane) or dehydrogenation (propene) products for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample is presented in Fig. 6. It is observed that the deactivation is faster in the CO2-rich atmosphere compared to inert one.</p>
<p>The DTG curves recorded for the active carbon-based catalysts in the argon atmosphere (measurement conditions: sample 0.025 g; Ar flow rate = 80 ml/min;temperature range = 301000 C, heating rate = 10 C/min).</p>
<p>Similar DTG profiles were recorded for the Cr(5.0)/AC sample used in the catalytic runs. It should, however, be noticed that the decom- position of carbonyl/carboxyl groups in the course of the propane dehydrogenation stabilized slightly the carbonaceous support.</p>
<p>Finally, the interaction between CO2 and the active carbon- based samples was studied by TG. The resulting DTG profiles are shown in Fig. 9. It should be noticed that CO2 is much less effective oxidizing agent compared to air.</p>

1. Chromium oxide catalysts show varying levels of activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. The Cr loading significantly influences their performance. A catalyst with a Cr content around 5% demonstrates the highest propane conversion efficiency. As the Cr loading increases, the formation of a crystalline -Cr2O3 phase occurs, which partially blocks micropores and decreases catalytic activity.
2. The specific surface area and micropore volume of the active carbon-based catalysts decrease with increasing Cr loading. This is because the chromium oxide species tend to deposit primarily on the external surface of the active carbon support, partially blocking the micropores.
3. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity compared to other catalysts previously studied for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The deactivation rate is notably faster in a CO2-rich atmosphere than in an inert one.
4. Thermal analysis reveals that the active carbon support contains carbonyl- and carboxyl-like surface species that play a role in the catalytic process. These species' concentration gradually decreases after the catalytic run. Simultaneously, inactive coke forms on the catalyst surface during the propane dehydrogenation.
5. Carbon dioxide acts as a less effective oxidizing agent than air in the interaction with the active carbon-based samples. Its role in the gasification of the active carbon support is minimal under the conditions used during the catalytic process.

1. 铬氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢过程中的活性和选择性存在差异。铬含量显著影响其性能。含铬量约5%的催化剂表现出最高的丙烷转化效率。随着铬含量的增加，会形成结晶的- Cr2O3相，这会部分阻塞微孔并降低催化活性。
2. 活性碳基催化剂的比表面积和微孔体积随铬负载的增加而减少。这是因为铬氧化物物种倾向于主要沉积在外表面活性碳支持上，部分阻塞微孔。
3. Cr(5.0)/AC催化剂在CO2存在下的活性显著高于之前研究中其他催化剂的活性。在富含CO2的气氛下，催化剂的失活速率明显快于惰性气氛。
4. 热分析显示，活性碳支持包含在催化过程中起作用的羰基-和羧基类表面物种。这些物种的浓度在催化运行后逐渐减少。同时，在丙烷脱氢过程中，在催化剂表面上形成了无活性焦炭。
5. 二氧化碳在与活性碳基样品的相互作用中作为比空气更不有效的氧化剂。在催化过程使用的条件下，其对活性碳支持的气化作用很小。
