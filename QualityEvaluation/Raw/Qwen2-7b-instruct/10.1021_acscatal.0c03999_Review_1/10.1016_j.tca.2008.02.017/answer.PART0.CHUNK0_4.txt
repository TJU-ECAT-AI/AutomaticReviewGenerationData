[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]."
[2] "Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."
[3] "Inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM- 41, SBA-15, MSU-x) and carbonaceous materials (diamond, active carbon) were tested as the supports."
[4] "Some of these studies have demonstrated that promoting effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane strongly depends on properties of support [9,10,13,15,21]."
[5] "In the presented work, we have shown the promoting effect of active carbon support in the catalytic process of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide."
[6] "The optimal catalyst composition was determined for the reac- tion performed at a thermodynamically reasonable temperature of 600 C."
[7] "An increase in the Cr loading results in an appearance of crystalline phase of chromium oxide."
[8] "The presence of this phase, which is manifested by three diffrac- tion lines at about 33.5, 36.1and 54.82, is most distinct for the Cr(10.0)/AC sample."
[9] "The observed diffraction peaks can be indexed as (1 0 4), (1 1 0) and (1 1 6), respectively, and are characteristic for rhombohedral -Cr2O3 with space group R 3c."
[10] "It was found that the catalytic activity and selectivity strongly depended on the Cr loading. The highest propane conversions were achieved for the sample with the Cr content closed to 5 wt.%. An increase in the Cr loading resulted in the forma- tion of crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, a partial blocking of micropores and a decrease in the catalytic activity."

1. A variety of catalysts, including Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, and Zn as active components and potassium oxide as a promoter, as well as inorganic oxides, mesoporous sieves, and carbonaceous materials as supports, have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2.
2. The promoting effect of CO2 on propane dehydrogenation varies depending on the properties of the support material.
3. Active carbon was found to significantly enhance the catalytic process of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of carbon dioxide.
4. The optimal catalyst composition was determined at a temperature of 600°C, which is thermodynamically reasonable.
5. Increasing the chromium loading led to the formation of a crystalline phase of chromium oxide, characterized by specific diffraction peaks.
6. The highest propane conversions were achieved with a chromium content close to 5 wt.%, whereas further increases in loading resulted in decreased activity due to the formation of the crystalline phase and partial blocking of micropores.
