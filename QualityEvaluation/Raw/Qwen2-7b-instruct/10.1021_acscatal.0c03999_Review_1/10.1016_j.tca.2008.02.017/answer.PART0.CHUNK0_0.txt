[1] "A great variety of catalysts have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 [924]. Different oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr and Zn) were used as the active components, while potassium oxide was used as a promoter."
[2] "Inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x) and carbonaceous materials (diamond, active carbon) were tested as the supports."
[3] "The optimal catalyst composition was determined for the reac- tion performed at a thermodynamically reasonable temperature of 600 C. An influence of the Cr loading on the initial propane conversion and the products selectivity is demonstrated in Fig. 3A and B, respectively."
[4] "It was found that when the propane conversion increases, a decrease in the propene selectivity is observed."
[5] "An introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface caused a clear shift of oxidation process towards lower temperatures."
[6] "The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst used in the reaction is gasified starting from 310 C. Moreover, a difference in stability between the samples used in the inert and CO2 atmosphere can be distinguished."

1. A wide range of catalysts, including different metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Fe, Zr, Zn) and various inorganic oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO), mesoporous sieves (MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x), and carbon materials (diamond, active carbon) were evaluated for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation.
2. Chromium oxide supported on active carbon showed exceptional activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The optimal loading was around 5 wt.%, and higher loads led to the formation of crystalline Cr2O3, which negatively impacted activity due to pore blockage.
3. As the propane conversion increased, the propene selectivity decreased.
4. The presence of chromium on the active carbon surface led to a shift in the oxidation process to lower temperatures.
5. The Cr(5.0)/AC catalyst began to be oxidized at 310 C during the reaction, showing differences in stability between inert and CO2 atmospheres.

1. 多种催化剂，包括不同金属氧化物（Ga、Cr、V、Fe、Zr、Zn）和各种无机氧化物（SiO2、Al2O3、TiO2、ZrO2、MgO）、微孔筛（MCM-41、SBA-15、MSU-x）以及碳材料（钻石、活性碳）被用于二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢。
2. 硫酸铬负载在活性碳上表现出在二氧化碳存在下丙烷脱氢的极佳活性和选择性。最佳负载量约为5 wt.%，更高的负载导致结晶Cr2O3的形成，这由于孔隙堵塞而对活性产生了负面影响。
3. 随着丙烷转化率的增加，丙烯的选择性下降。
4. Cr负载在活性碳表面导致氧化过程向较低温度偏移。
5. Cr(5.0)/AC 催化剂在反应过程中从310°C开始被氧化，显示了惰性和二氧化碳气氛之间的稳定性差异。
