1. Active carbon is considered a promising support for alkane dehydrogenation catalysts, with its performance tested in the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene and isobutane in the presence of carbon dioxide. Propane to propene conversion via direct dehydrogenation is a more critical research topic, as propene is essential for various chemical intermediates and polymers. In the novel process, propene is produced with higher yield compared to traditional methods. Carbon dioxide's promoting effect on propane dehydrogenation is explained by its involvement in direct oxidation of propane to propene.

2. Increasing the chromium loading leads to the formation of a crystalline phase of chromium oxide. This change affects the micropore volume, as evident from calculations using the t-plot method.

3. The distinct diffraction lines at approximately 33.5, 36.1, and 54.82 are indicative of the presence of rhombohedral -Cr2O3 in the Cr(10.0)/AC sample. Chromium oxide species are primarily deposited on the external surface of the active carbon support.

4. The introduction of chromium on the active carbon surface shifts the oxidation process to lower temperatures, indicating that CrOx acts as an active phase in carbon gasification. 

5. There is a noticeable difference in stability between samples used in inert and carbon dioxide atmospheres, suggesting that the presence of carbon dioxide stabilizes the active carbon support.

1. 活性碳被认为是一种有前景的烷烃脱氢催化剂载体，其性能在存在二氧化碳的情况下被测试用于乙苯和异丁烷的脱氢。通过直接脱氢途径将丙烷转化为丙烯是更关键的研究课题，因为丙烯是各种中间体和聚合物的原料。在新过程中，与传统方法相比，丙烯的产量更高。二氧化碳促进丙烷脱氢的作用通过其直接氧化丙烷生成丙烯来解释。

2. 增加铬负载导致铬氧化物相的结晶化。这种变化影响微孔体积，如通过t-图法计算得出。

3. 大约33.5、36.1和54.82的特征衍射线表明Cr(10.0)/AC样品中存在rhombohedral -Cr2O3。铬氧化物种主要沉积在活性碳支持物的外部表面。

4. 在活性碳表面引入铬导致氧化过程向较低温度偏移，这表明CrOx是碳气化的活性相。

5. 使用惰性和二氧化碳气氛的样品之间存在明显的稳定性差异，这表明二氧化碳稳定了活性碳支持物。
