[1] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP shows that chromium supported on silica, especially in a mesoporous form, and diamond exhibit the most promising results. The catalyst activity is influenced by the dispersion of chromium species, which is correlated with the catalyst's performance. Among different metal oxides tested, chromium supported on various substrates, including silica, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, has proven to be the most effective for CO2-ODHP. However, there is a trade-off between propene and isobutene selectivity and the total olefin selectivity, as an increase in the selectivity towards lighter olefins leads to a slight decrease in the selectivity for propene and isobutene.

在CO2-ODHP的催化性能比较中，含铬的硅酸盐，特别是微孔形式，以及金刚石显示出最佳的结果。催化剂活性受铬物种分散度的影响，这与催化剂性能密切相关。在不同金属氧化物的测试中，含铬的硅、沸石、活性碳和金刚石等基底上具有最好的性能。然而，在选择性方面存在权衡，对于较轻的烯烃的选择性增加会导致丙烯和异丁烯选择性的轻微下降。
