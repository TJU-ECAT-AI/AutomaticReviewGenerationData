2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation of a commercial silica (KSKG, Russia) with solution of Cr(NO3)39H2O of appropriate concentration to obtain the desired Cr loading.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preliminary thermodynamic evaluations
Oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins in the presence of CO2 is an endothermic equilibrium process. To verify the feasibility of the process, calculations of the equilibrium constants (Kp) and DG at the temperatures of interest have been performed.
