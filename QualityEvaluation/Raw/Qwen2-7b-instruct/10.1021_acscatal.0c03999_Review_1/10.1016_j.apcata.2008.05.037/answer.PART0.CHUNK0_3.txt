Various metal oxide catalysts, including alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides, were tested for CO2-ODHP. Chromium supported on different materials like SiO2, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond showed the best performance. Among these, chromium supported on SiO2, particularly in a mesoporous form, and diamond loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr, were the most promising. Studies with these catalysts provided basic insights into ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures, although the operational conditions differed significantly from industrial requirements. This research focused on the catalytic performance of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and isobutane at high conversions, utilizing CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants. The structure-function relationship of supported chromium species was evaluated through DR UVvis spectroscopy.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，包括碱土金属、过渡金属和稀有地球金属氧化物，被测试用于CO2-ODHP。其中，Cr在SiO2、沸石、活性碳和钻石上的负载表现出最佳性能。在这些材料中，SiO2的多孔形式以及1.78.0wt% Cr负载的钻石是最有前景的。这些催化剂的研究提供了关于轻烷烃与CO2和CO2/O2混合物的ODH的基本见解，但操作条件与工业需求有很大不同。本研究关注了CrOx/SiO2催化剂在高转化率下对丙烷和异丁烷的氧化脱氢作用，使用CO2和CO2/O2混合物作为氧化剂。通过DR UVvis光谱技术评估了负载铬物种的结构-功能关系。
