<quotes>
[1] "Most studies in the field of ODH of light paraffins in the presence of CO2 or CO2/O2 mixtures were devoted to ethane [7 21], while ODH of C3C4-alkanes was explored in a lower extent [17,2229]."
[2] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."
[3] "Some decrease in the propene and isobutene selectivity occurred, but because of the increase of the selectivity towards lighter olefins, the total olefin selectivity increased."
[4] "Because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."

In the context of CO2-ODHP, alkaline-earth, transition, and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts. However, among these, chromium-supported catalysts, particularly those supported on silica, have shown the most promising results. The performance of the catalysts is influenced by the dispersion of chromium species. Higher dispersion tends to correlate with improved activity and selectivity. The use of a CO2/O2 mixture as an oxidant leads to an increase in catalyst activity and stability. While the selectivity towards propene and isobutene might decrease, the total olefin selectivity increases due to a higher preference for the formation of lighter olefins. The operational conditions in previous studies were often far from the requirements of industrial processes, which typically aim for conversion rates greater than 50% and total olefin selectivities greater than 90%.

在CO2-ODHP领域，碱土金属、过渡金属和稀有地球金属氧化物被用作催化剂。然而，在这些催化剂中，特别是那些以硅酸盐为载体的铬催化剂显示出最令人鼓舞的结果。催化剂性能受铬物种分散度的影响。更高的分散度往往与提高的活性和选择性相关联。使用二氧化碳/氧气混合物作为氧化剂导致催化剂活性和稳定性增加。虽然丙烯和异丁烯的选择性可能会降低，但总烯烃选择性会因为对形成更轻的烯烃有更高的偏好而增加。以往研究的操作条件通常远未达到工业过程的要求，这些过程通常希望转化率大于50%，总烯烃选择性大于90%。

[2] "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."

Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium supported on silica, SiO2, mesoporous SiO2, and diamond, show the most promising results for CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the dispersion of chromium species and the Cr loading. High Cr loading, specifically around 5.0 wt%, exhibits the highest activity, selectivity, and stability. Catalyst activity correlates with more dispersed chromates. The study was designed to achieve high conversions similar to industrial processes requirements, utilizing both CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants. Detailed insights into the structure-function relationship of supported chromium species were obtained through diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopy.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP shows that chromium supported on silica, especially in a mesoporous form, and diamond exhibit the most promising results. The catalyst activity is influenced by the dispersion of chromium species, which is correlated with the catalyst's performance. Among different metal oxides tested, chromium supported on various substrates, including silica, zeolites, active carbon, and diamond, has proven to be the most effective for CO2-ODHP. However, there is a trade-off between propene and isobutene selectivity and the total olefin selectivity, as an increase in the selectivity towards lighter olefins leads to a slight decrease in the selectivity for propene and isobutene.
