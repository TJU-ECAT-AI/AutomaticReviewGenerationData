[1] "Among the supported systems the most promising results were obtained for SiO2 [12,15,17,21,23,24], also in a mesoporous form [17,27,28], and diamond [22] loaded with 1.78.0 wt% Cr."
[2] "Several basic insights on the ODH of light alkanes with CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures have been obtained by using such catalysts, but,because of specific targets, in those studies the settings of the operational conditions resulted quite far from those of actual interest for industrial processes (i.e. conversion  50% and total olefin selectivity  90%)."
[3] "Alkaline-earth, transition and rare-earth metal oxides have been tested as catalysts for ODH of C2C4 in the presence of CO2,but the best performance has been obtained with chromium supported on various oxides, zeolites, active carbon and diamond."
[4] "The catalyst activity seemed correlated to more dispersed chromates."
[5] "The highest activity, selectivity and stability were exhibited by a catalyst with a Cr loading of 5.0 wt%."
[6] "In particular, reaction conditions were set to attain high conversions, similar to that required in industrial processes."
[7] "The tests has been carried out by using as oxidant both CO2 only and CO2/O2 mixture."

Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium supported on silica, SiO2, mesoporous SiO2, and diamond, show the most promising results for CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing catalytic performance include the dispersion of chromium species and the Cr loading. High Cr loading, specifically around 5.0 wt%, exhibits the highest activity, selectivity, and stability. Catalyst activity correlates with more dispersed chromates. The study was designed to achieve high conversions similar to industrial processes requirements, utilizing both CO2 and CO2/O2 mixtures as oxidants. Detailed insights into the structure-function relationship of supported chromium species were obtained through diffuse reflectance UVvis spectroscopy.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，尤其是硅酸盐、二氧化硅、介孔二氧化硅和钻石上负载的铬，显示出CO2-ODHP的最佳结果。影响催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的分散性和Cr加载量。高Cr加载量，大约为5.0 wt%，表现出最高的活性、选择性和稳定性。催化剂活性与更分散的铬物种相关。研究旨在达到类似于工业过程需求的高转化率，使用二氧化碳和二氧化碳/氧气混合物作为氧化剂。通过漫反射紫外可见光谱法获得了支持铬物种的详细结构-功能关系见解。
