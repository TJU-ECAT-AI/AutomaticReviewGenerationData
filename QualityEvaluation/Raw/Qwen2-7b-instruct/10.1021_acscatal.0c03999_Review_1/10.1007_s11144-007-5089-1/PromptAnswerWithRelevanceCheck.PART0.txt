1. The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary based on the type of metal oxide and its loading. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those with low chromium content and supported on silica, exhibit enhanced performance in this process, showing higher conversion rates and propene yields in the presence of CO2. The redox behavior of chromium species on the surface of the catalyst plays a significant role in this catalytic activity.

2. The promotion effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is influenced by the chromium loading on the catalyst. As the chromium loading decreases, the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield increases. This suggests that catalysts with low chromium content are more efficient in converting propane to propene in the presence of CO2.

3. The regeneration of the catalyst after exposure to CO2 shows that CO2 is a weak oxidant, and its effectiveness in reoxidizing chromium species is significantly less compared to oxygen. This implies that direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where chromium species are reoxidized, is not the primary pathway for propene formation on these catalysts.

1. 不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性存在差异，这主要取决于催化剂的类型及其负载量。特别是那些低铬含量并以硅为载体的铬氧化物催化剂，在此过程中表现出增强性能，显示出更高的转化率和丙烯产率。催化剂表面铬物种的还原行为对催化活性起着重要作用。

2. 二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进效果受催化剂上铬含量的影响。随着铬含量的降低，二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进效果增加。这表明低铬含量的催化剂更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯在二氧化碳的存在下。

3. 催化剂再生后暴露于二氧化碳的实验显示，二氧化碳是一种弱氧化剂，其在重新氧化铬物种方面的效率远低于氧气。这意味着直接通过二氧化碳氧化脱氢丙烷，其中铬物种被重新氧化，不是这些催化剂形成丙烯的主要途径。

Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly those with chromium oxide (CrOx) supported on silica (SiO2), exhibit different activities and selectivities for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (CO2-ODHP). The performance of these catalysts is significantly influenced by the chromium loading and the properties of the support material. As per the literature, the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is dependent on the chromium content of the catalyst. Specifically, when the chromium content is below the monolayer capacity on the silica support (around 0.6 Cr atoms/nm2), the catalyst shows enhanced activity and selectivity towards propene production in the presence of CO2. This enhanced activity is attributed to the specific oxidation states of chromium species present on the surface of the catalyst, which include Cr3+, Cr5+, and Cr6+. The presence of Cr3+ species, which are capable of being reduced and thus facilitating the dehydrogenation process, plays a crucial role. Moreover, the literature suggests that CO2 acts as a weak oxidant for regenerating the catalyst, with oxygen being a more efficient reoxidant compared to CO2. This implies that the direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where Cr3+ ions are reoxidized to Cr6+, is not the primary pathway for propene formation.

The bi-functional nature of CrOx/SiO2 catalysts, which is active in both the dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reactions, contributes to higher propane conversion and propene yield when CO2 is present. This bi-functionality might be due to the redox behavior of chromium species on the surface of silica-supported catalysts, which is promoted especially at low chromium loadings. At these loadings, the migration of Cr3+ species to form stable Cr2O3 clusters is slower, allowing further reduction to occur. Conversely, at higher loadings, the reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2O3 halts due to the high stability of this oxide. This redox behavior explains the observations regarding the decreasing promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene with increasing chromium loading.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是含铬氧化物（CrOx）支持在硅酸盐（SiO2）上的催化剂，在CO2辅助下脱氢化烃（CO2-ODHP）中表现出不同的活性和选择性。这些催化剂的性能受到铬负载量和支撑材料性质的显著影响。根据文献，CO2促进丙烯产量的效果依赖于催化剂中的铬含量。当催化剂中的铬含量低于其在硅酸盐支持下的单层容量（大约为0.6 Cr原子/nm2）时，催化剂在CO2存在的条件下显示出增强的活性和丙烯选择性。这种增强的活性归因于催化剂表面特定氧化状态的铬物种的存在，包括Cr3+、Cr5+和Cr6+。能够被还原并从而促进脱氢过程的Cr3+物种起着关键作用。此外，文献表明，CO2作为再生催化剂的弱氧化剂，与氧气相比，CO2的再氧化效率要低得多。这意味着，通过CO2直接氧化脱氢丙烷，其中Cr3+离子被氧化到Cr6+，不是丙烯形成的主要途径。

CrOx/SiO2催化剂的双功能特性，既在脱氢反应又在逆水煤气变换（RWGS）反应中活跃，导致在CO2存在下丙烷转化率和丙烯产量更高。这种双功能性可能是由于SiO2支持的催化剂表面上的铬物种的氧化还原行为所导致的，特别是在低铬负载量的情况下。在这种负载量下，Cr3+物种迁移到形成稳定的Cr2O3簇的速度较慢，允许进一步的还原继续进行。相反，在较高负载量下，Cr3+还原到Cr2O3停止，因为这种氧化物的稳定性很高。这种氧化还原行为解释了关于随着铬负载量增加，CO2促进丙烯产量效果降低的观察结果。
