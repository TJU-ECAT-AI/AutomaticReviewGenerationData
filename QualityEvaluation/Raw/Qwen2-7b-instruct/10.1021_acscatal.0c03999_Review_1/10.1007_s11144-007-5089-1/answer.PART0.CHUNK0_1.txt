[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2 [6- 14]."
[2] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2,measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content."
[3] "It has been proposed that the Cr6+/5+ species dispersed on the surface of the oxide support are the precursors for the mononuclear surface Cr3+ species with two coordinatively unsaturated vacancies."
[4] "In the process without CO2, the second main product is hydrogen, while in the presence of CO2 both H2 and CO are formed."
[5] "Such redox behaviour of SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts may explain the previous observations [6,8], which reveal that the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene decreases with increasing Cr content."

1. Chromium-containing catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, as reported in studies from 2006 to 2014. The oxidative role of CO2 in this process varies depending on the chromium loading and the type of support material.
2. The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts is influenced by the chromium content. This effect increases with a decrease in chromium loading.
3. Chromium species on the surface of the oxide support, specifically Cr6+/5+, act as precursors for the formation of mononuclear surface Cr3+ species, which are considered active sites for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
4. Without CO2, the predominant product is hydrogen, while in the presence of CO2, both hydrogen and carbon monoxide are formed.
5. The observed behavior of silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, where the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene diminishes with higher chromium content, can be explained by the redox properties of the catalysts.

1. 含有铬的催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下能够催化烃类的脱氢反应，这一现象在2006年至2014年的研究中被报道。二氧化碳在这一过程中的氧化作用依赖于催化剂的负载量和支撑材料的类型。
2. 在二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂上，二氧化碳促进丙烯产率的效果受到铬含量的影响。随着铬含量的降低，这种效果会增强。
3. 铬物种在氧化物支撑表面的Cr6+/5+是形成表面单核Cr3+物种的前体，这些物种被认为是轻烷烃脱氢活性位点。
4. 在没有二氧化碳的情况下，主要产物是氢气，而在二氧化碳存在的条件下，氢气和一氧化碳同时生成。
5. 观察到的二氧化硅支持的铬氧化物催化剂行为，即随着铬含量的增加，二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进效果减弱，可以由催化剂的还原性特性来解释。
