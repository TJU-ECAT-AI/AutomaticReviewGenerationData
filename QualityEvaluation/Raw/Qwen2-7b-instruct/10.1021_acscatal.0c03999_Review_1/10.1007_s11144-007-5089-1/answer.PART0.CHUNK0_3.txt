[1] "Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2."
[2] "Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction."
[3] "Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content."
[4] "The above observations led us to the conclusion that it is worthwhile to extend the studies giving more attention to catalysts with low chromium loading."
[5] "In the process without CO2, the second main product is hydrogen, while in the presence of CO2 both H2 and CO are formed."
[6] "The effect of contact time (W/F) on the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 is shown in Fig. 1."
[7] "The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen."

1. Chromium oxide catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, particularly in the presence of CO2. CO2 can act as an oxidant, enhancing the yield of propene over silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts, but exhibits a weak oxidizing ability compared to oxygen. The promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield increases with decreasing chromium content in the catalyst.
2. Various metal oxide catalysts, including chromium oxide catalysts, differ in their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The specific properties of the support material, such as silica, and the chromium loading significantly influence catalytic performance. Lower chromium loadings can enhance propene yield in the presence of CO2.

1. 含有铬的氧化物催化剂在碳氢化合物的脱氢反应中是活跃的，特别是在二氧化碳的存在下。二氧化碳可以作为氧化剂，增强在硅酸盐支持的铬氧化物催化剂上的丙烯产率，但与氧气相比，二氧化碳的氧化能力较弱。在催化剂中的铬含量较低时，二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进作用会增加。
2. 不同的金属氧化物催化剂，特别是铬氧化物催化剂，在二氧化碳辅助脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性存在差异。支持材料的具体性质，如硅酸盐，以及铬的负载量显著影响催化性能。较低的铬负载可以增强在二氧化碳存在的条件下丙烯的产率。
