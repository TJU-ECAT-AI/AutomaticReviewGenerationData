1. The activity and selectivity of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP vary based on the type of metal oxide and its loading. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those with low chromium content and supported on silica, exhibit enhanced performance in this process, showing higher conversion rates and propene yields in the presence of CO2. The redox behavior of chromium species on the surface of the catalyst plays a significant role in this catalytic activity.

2. The promotion effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is influenced by the chromium loading on the catalyst. As the chromium loading decreases, the promoting effect of CO2 on propene yield increases. This suggests that catalysts with low chromium content are more efficient in converting propane to propene in the presence of CO2.

3. The regeneration of the catalyst after exposure to CO2 shows that CO2 is a weak oxidant, and its effectiveness in reoxidizing chromium species is significantly less compared to oxygen. This implies that direct oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by CO2, where chromium species are reoxidized, is not the primary pathway for propene formation on these catalysts.

1. 不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳氧化脱氢反应（CO2-ODHP）中的活性和选择性存在差异，这主要取决于催化剂的类型及其负载量。特别是那些低铬含量并以硅为载体的铬氧化物催化剂，在此过程中表现出增强性能，显示出更高的转化率和丙烯产率。催化剂表面铬物种的还原行为对催化活性起着重要作用。

2. 二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进效果受催化剂上铬含量的影响。随着铬含量的降低，二氧化碳对丙烯产率的促进效果增加。这表明低铬含量的催化剂更有效地将丙烷转化为丙烯在二氧化碳的存在下。

3. 催化剂再生后暴露于二氧化碳的实验显示，二氧化碳是一种弱氧化剂，其在重新氧化铬物种方面的效率远低于氧气。这意味着直接通过二氧化碳氧化脱氢丙烷，其中铬物种被重新氧化，不是这些催化剂形成丙烯的主要途径。
