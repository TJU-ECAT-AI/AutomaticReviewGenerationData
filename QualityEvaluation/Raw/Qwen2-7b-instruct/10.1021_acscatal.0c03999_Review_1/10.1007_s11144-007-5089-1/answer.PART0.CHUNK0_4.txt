<p>Recently, it has been reported that the chromium containing catalysts are also active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2.</p>
<p>Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content.</p>
<p>The above observations led us to the conclusion that it is worthwhile to extend the studies giving more attention to catalysts with low chromium loading.</p>
<p>The total amount of chromium deposited on the surface of SiO2 is below monolayer capacity, which for this system corresponds to 0.6 Cr atoms/nm2.</p>
<p>The effect of CO2 is strongly influenced by the nature of support. CO2 enhances the yield of propene only when chromium oxide is supported on siliceous materials (silica gel, MCM-41, SBA-15, MSU-x).</p>
<p>Over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported chromium oxide catalysts CO2 exerts an inhibiting effect on the dehydrogenation reaction.</p>
<p>Moreover, few studies have reported that over the silica supported chromium oxide catalyst, the promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene obtained in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmospheree, depends on the chromium loading, and rises with decreasing Cr content.</p>
<p>In the process without CO2, the second main product is hydrogen, while in the presence of CO2 both H2 and CO are formed.</p>
<p>The molar ratio of H2/CO drops with increase of the reaction temperature, indicating that CO2 is activated at higher temperatures.</p>
<p>Propene selectivity for the process in He atmosphere was constant, whereas in the presence of CO2 slightly dropped at longer W/F.</p>
<p>The DRS results obtained during the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst show that CO2 is a very weak oxidant and that the efficiency of reoxidation by CO2 is much lower than that by oxygen.</p>

1. Chromium-containing catalysts are active in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons in the presence of CO2, and the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene depends on the chromium loading, increasing with decreasing Cr content.
2. The nature of the support significantly influences the oxidative role of CO2 in the dehydrogenation process. CO2 enhances propene production when supported on siliceous materials, but inhibits reactions over Al2O3 or ZrO2 supports.
3. The molar ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide decreases with increasing reaction temperature when CO2 is present, suggesting CO2 activation at higher temperatures.
4. The selectivity to propene in the presence of CO2 slightly decreases at longer contact times compared to a He atmosphere.
5. CO2 is identified as a weak oxidant in the regeneration of the reduced CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, with its efficiency in reoxidation being much lower than that of oxygen.

1. 含有铬的催化剂在二氧化碳的存在下对烃类脱氢反应具有活性，并且二氧化碳对丙烯产率的影响取决于铬含量，随着铬含量的降低而增加。
2. 支持材料的性质显著影响二氧化碳在脱氢过程中的氧化作用。当支持在硅基质上时，二氧化碳可以促进丙烯的生成，但在Al2O3或ZrO2支持的铬氧化物催化剂上则抑制反应。
3. 当二氧化碳存在时，随着反应温度的升高，氢气与一氧化碳的摩尔比降低，这表明二氧化碳在较高温度下被激活。
4. 在二氧化碳存在的过程中，丙烯的选择性相对于氦气气氛略有下降。
5. 二氧化碳在还原CrOx/SiO2催化剂的再生中被识别为一种弱氧化剂，其重新氧化效率远低于氧气。
