Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none.

Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.).

Cr Content-Dependent Evolution of Cr Sites For supported Cr catalysts, the generation and dispersion of Cr species at lower oxidation states (i.e., Cr3+/Cr2+) are of importance in attaining high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP, the structural evolution of which relies heavily on Cr coverage and textural properties of the support.

Redox Cycle As shown in Figure 4, there exists a clear correlation of C3H6 yield with the number of redox sites, corroborating the important role of redox Cr species in assuring high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP.

Effects of Support
Metal Oxides In an early work led by Ge et al., the prominent activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 has been confirmed via screening tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2).

Ordered, Mesoporous Silica (MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1)
MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, features well-ordered channels, controllable uniform pore size (210 nm), and large surface area, and can be incorporated by heteroatoms, such as Cr, into the wall substituting Si4+ and forming isolated active centers.

MSU-x features high surface area (6001000 m2 g1 and 35 nm pore size) and 3D wormlike channels, which can potentially improve the dispersion of Cr species and facilitate the diffusion of reagent molecules.

A comparative study, led by Zhang et al., finds that a SBA-15-supported Cr catalyst exerts better catalytic performance and stability than γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2-supported counterparts for CO2ODHP (Table 2).

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals that Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 show activity, with decreasing C3H6 yield in the order of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3 > Al2O3 > SiO2. Key factors influencing catalytic performance include metal oxide dispersion and support properties, particularly active site configuration and redox properties. Supported Cr2O3 catalysts exhibit Cr content-dependent evolution of Cr species, with optimal activity at a monolayer coverage. The redox cycle plays a crucial role in ensuring high C3H6 yield. Different metal oxides impact catalytic performance through their ability to affect Cr dispersion and support properties. MCM-41, MSU-x, and SBA-15 offer enhanced dispersion and diffusion capabilities for Cr species, improving catalytic activity and stability.

对于CO2-ODHP，Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3表现出活性，C3H6产率按照Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3 > Al2O3 > SiO2递减。影响催化性能的关键因素包括金属氧化物的分散性和支持物性质，特别是活性位点配置和还原性。支持的Cr2O3催化剂显示出随着Cr含量增加而Cr物种演化，并在单层覆盖率时达到最佳活性。红ox循环在确保高C3H6产率方面起着关键作用。不同金属氧化物通过影响Cr物种的分散性和支持物性质来影响催化性能。MCM-41、MSU-x和SBA-15通过提高Cr物种的分散性和扩散能力，改善催化活性和稳定性。
