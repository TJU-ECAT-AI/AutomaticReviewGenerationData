Answer:

How do various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, and what are the key factors influencing their catalytic performance, with particular emphasis on the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties?

Different metal oxides like Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 show varying degrees of activity in CO2-ODHP, with Ga2O3 being the most active followed by Fe2O3 and Cr2O3. The performance of these catalysts is influenced by several factors including the dispersion of metal oxide species, particularly at lower oxidation states (Cr3+/Cr2+), and the textural properties of the support material. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is crucial for achieving high C3H6 yield in CO2-ODHP. The redox cycle is a significant factor in ensuring high C3H6 yield. The nature of the support material plays a critical role in affecting the dispersion and evolution of chromium species, thus determining the intrinsic activity of the catalyst.

Effects of Support
Metal Oxides In an early work led by Ge et al., the prominent activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 has been confirmed via screening tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2).

Ordered, Mesoporous Silica (MCM-41, MSU-x, SBA-15/SBA-1, and TUD-1)
MCM-41, a typical mesoporous molecular sieve, features well-ordered channels, controllable uniform pore size (210 nm), and large surface area, and can be incorporated by heteroatoms, such as Cr, into the wall substituting Si4+ and forming isolated active centers.

MSU-x features high surface area (6001000 m2 g1 and 35 nm pore size) and 3D wormlike channels, which can potentially improve the dispersion of Cr species and facilitate the diffusion of reagent molecules.

A comparative study, led by Zhang et al., finds that a SBA-15-supported Cr catalyst exerts better catalytic performance and stability than γ-Al2O3, SiO2, and ZrO2-supported counterparts for CO2ODHP (Table 2).
