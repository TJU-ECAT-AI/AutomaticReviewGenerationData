Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none. For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity (Table 2).

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, with Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 showing activity. The C3H6 yield decreases in the order Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3 > Al2O3 > SiO2. Cr2O3 performs better than Fe2O3 and Al2O3 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity when supported on SiO2 and Al2O3.

Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %). The prominent activity on (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 correlates to well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; yet high Cr loadings give rise to the formation of extended polychromate structures that are less active.

For all fresh catalysts, Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates. Only Cr(III) exists in the form of α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings (3.0 wt. % or more). The high activity of (Cr2O3)5/SiO2 is associated with the well-dispersed mono- and dichromates; however, high Cr loadings lead to the formation of extended polychromate structures, which are less active.
