          "Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3 > Cr2O3 > Al2O3 > SiO2."
          "Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity."
          "Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acid-base property, etc.)."
          "The nature of the support is important in affecting the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, therefore determining the intrinsic activity."

          Various metal oxide catalysts, including Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3, demonstrate activity in CO2-ODHP, with Ga2O3 having the highest C3H6 yield, followed by Fe2O3, Cr2O3, Al2O3, and SiO2. Cr2O3 shows superior performance compared to the other two metal oxides in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity. Continuous efforts have been made to understand the factors influencing catalytic performance, with a focus on metal oxide dispersion and support properties. The intrinsic activity of the catalyst is significantly affected by the dispersion and evolution of Cr species, which in turn is determined by the nature of the support.

          各种金属氧化物催化剂，如Ga2O3、Fe2O3和Cr2O3，在CO2-ODHP中表现出活性，Ga2O3的C3H6产率最高，依次为Fe2O3、Cr2O3、Al2O3和SiO2。Cr2O3在C3H8转化率和C3H6产率及选择性方面均优于其他两种金属氧化物。持续的努力旨在澄清催化性能及其增强的必要因素之间的关系，重点关注金属氧化物的分散性和支撑物的性质。催化剂的内在活性受到Cr物种的分散和演化的影响，而这种演化又由支撑物的性质决定。

          "Cr(VI) is in the form of mono-, di-, and polychromates for all fresh catalysts and Cr(III) only exists in the form of (α-Cr2O3) at higher Cr loadings (i.e.,  3.0 wt. %)."
          "Redox Cycle As shown in Figure 4, there exists a clear correlation of C3H6 yield with the number of redox sites, corroborating the important role of redox Cr species in assuring high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP."
          "Effects of Support
          Metal Oxides In an early work led by Ge et al., the prominent activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 has been confirmed via screening tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2)."

          For all freshly prepared catalysts, Cr(VI) is present in the forms of mono-, di-, and poly-chromates, while Cr(III) only exists as α-Cr2O3 at higher Cr loadings (3.0 wt. % or more). The redox cycle, as illustrated in Figure 4, demonstrates a clear relationship between C3H6 yield and the number of redox sites, validating the critical role of redox Cr species in achieving high C3H6 yield in CO2ODHP. In an early study by Ge et al., the exceptional activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 was confirmed through comparative tests on Cr2O3, Cr2O3/SiO2, Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3, Cr2O3/ZrO2, Cr2O3/TiO2, and Cr2O3/MCM-41 (Table 2).

          对于所有新鲜制备的催化剂，Cr(VI)以单、二和多铬酸盐的形式存在，而只有在更高Cr负载（3.0 wt. %或以上）时Cr(III)才以α-Cr2O3形式存在。如图4所示的红ox循环显示了C3H6产率与可逆氧化还原位点数量之间的明确关系，这证实了在CO2ODHP中，可逆氧化还原Cr物种在确保高C3H6产率方面起着至关重要的作用。Ge等人早期的一项研究通过对比测试Cr2O3、Cr2O3/SiO2、Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3、Cr2O3/ZrO2、Cr2O3/TiO2和Cr2O3/MCM-41（表2），确认了Cr2O3/SiO2的卓越活性。
