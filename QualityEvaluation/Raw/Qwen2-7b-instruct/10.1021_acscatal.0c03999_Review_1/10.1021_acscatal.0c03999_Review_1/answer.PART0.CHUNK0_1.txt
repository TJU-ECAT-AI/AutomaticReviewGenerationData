Among them, Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 exhibit activity, and the C3H6 yield decreases in the sequence of Ga2O3 > Fe2O3  Cr2O3  Al2O3 > SiO2  none.

Continuous efforts have been put forth to clarify the relationship of catalytic performance and essential factors for enhancements, primarily focusing on metal oxide dispersion (e.g., active site configuration, redox properties, etc.) and the nature of the support (e.g., textural property, acidbase property, etc.).

For SiO2 and Al2O3-supported counterparts, Cr2O3 performs better than the other two metal oxides in terms of both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity (Table 2).

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals that Ga2O3, Fe2O3, and Cr2O3 show activity. Among them, Ga2O3 demonstrates the highest C3H6 yield, followed by Fe2O3 and Cr2O3. Cr2O3 outperforms Al2O3 and SiO2 in terms of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield and selectivity, particularly when supported on SiO2 and Al2O3. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include metal oxide dispersion and the nature of the support, which affect the active site configuration, redox properties, textural properties, and acid-base properties.
