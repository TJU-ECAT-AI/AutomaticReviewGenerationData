[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr (57), Ga (46), Ni (46), V (40), Fe (51), Mn (47), and Co (45) on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method (number in the parentheses shows Si/M ratios determined by ICP), among which Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehy- drogenation of C3H8."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."

1. Among the tested metals on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, chromium (Cr) showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8). Other notable metals were gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co).

2. The Cr-MCM-41 catalyst demonstrated the highest activity, producing propene with a 30% conversion and a selectivity exceeding 90%.

3. Chromium species in the catalyst evolved from tetrahedral coordination to form active monochromate species during the reaction, which then reduced to less active octahedral coordination.

4. The deactivated catalyst was revived by treating it with oxygen gas, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to the Cr(VI) species.

[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis showed high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[2] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[3] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
[4] "Not only oxygen but also carbon dioxide could regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency of carbon dioxide was lower than that of oxygen."
[5] "It is concluded that during the reaction propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which is simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra."
[6] "The reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra can be reoxidized to Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra by carbon dioxide, and thus the reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra has an important role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41."

Various metal oxide catalysts were compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed high activity with a propene conversion of 30% and selectivity above 90%. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was influenced by metal loading and support properties. Cr(VI) formed as an active monochromate species, which was reduced to less active polychromate species (Cr(III)) during the reaction. Deactivation of the catalyst was regenerated through treatment with oxygen, leading to the reoxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI). Carbon dioxide could also regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, albeit with lower efficiency than oxygen. Propane was dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which were simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra. The reductionoxidation cycle between Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra and Cr(III)O6 octahedra played a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide over Cr-MCM-41.

各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性进行了比较。Cr-MCM-41催化剂显示出高活性，丙烯转化率为30%，选择性高于90%。在支持的Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种的演化受到负载量和支持性质的影响。Cr(VI)形成了活性单铬酸盐物种，在反应过程中被还原为活性较低的聚铬酸盐物种（Cr(III)）。催化剂失活通过氧气处理进行再生，导致Cr(III)被氧化回Cr(VI)。二氧化碳也可以从还原的Cr(III)O6八面体再生Cr(VI)O4四面体，但效率低于氧气。丙烷被Cr(IV)O4四面体脱氢成丙烯，同时被还原为Cr(III)O6八面体。Cr(VI)O4四面体和Cr(III)O6八面体之间的还原氧化周期在Cr-MCM-41上脱氢丙烷与二氧化碳中起着关键作用。
