[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr (57), Ga (46), Ni (46), V (40), Fe (51), Mn (47), and Co (45) on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method (number in the parentheses shows Si/M ratios determined by ICP), among which Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehy- drogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."

[2] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6 and at F = 0.134 mol(STP) h1 (Fig. 6)."

[3] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT (Si/Cr = 50) showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6 and at F = 0.134 mol(STP) h1 (Fig. 6)."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active poly- chromate species during the reaction."

[5] "Deactivated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."

1. Among the metals tested on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, chromium (Cr) exhibited the highest activity in the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8).

2. The Cr-MCM-41-DHT catalyst, prepared with a Si/Cr ratio of 50, demonstrated a propane conversion of 17.0% and a propene yield of 15.9%.

3. The same Cr-MCM-41-DHT catalyst with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 showed the described conversion and yield in the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane.

4. It is proposed that during the reaction, chromium (Cr) in a tetrahedral coordination forms an active monochromate species, which is reduced to a less active octahedral coordination as Cr(III).

5. The deactivated catalyst was restored through an oxygen treatment, where the Cr(III) species was reoxidized back to Cr(VI).

1. 在使用DHT方法制备的MCM-41上测试的各种金属中，铬(Cr)在丙烷(C3H8)的CO2脱氢反应中表现出最高的活性。

2. 以Si/Cr比例为50的Cr-MCM-41-DHT催化剂在氮气、二氧化碳和丙烷的摩尔比为10:34:6以及F = 0.134 mol(STP) h1的气体混合物中，丙烷转化率为17.0%，丙烯产率为15.9%。

3. 同样的Cr-MCM-41-DHT催化剂，Si/Cr比例为50，在丙烷的CO2脱氢反应中显示出描述的转化率和产率。

4. 假设在反应过程中，处于四面体配位的铬(Cr)形成一种活性单铬酸盐物种，并被还原为较不活跃的八面体配位的Cr(III)。

5. 通过氧气处理，失活的催化剂被恢复，Cr(III)物种被重新氧化回Cr(VI)。
