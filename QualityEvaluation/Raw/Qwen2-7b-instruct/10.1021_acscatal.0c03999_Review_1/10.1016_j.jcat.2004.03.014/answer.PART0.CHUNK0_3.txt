[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr (57), Ga (46), Ni (46), V (40), Fe (51), Mn (47), and Co (45) on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method (number in the parentheses shows Si/M ratios determined by ICP), among which Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehy- drogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."
[2] "The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption (77 K),diffuse reflectance UVvis, UV-Raman, and X-ray absorption (XANES and EXAFS) spectroscopic measurements."
[3] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[5] "Deacti- vated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."

1. In the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, chromium (Cr) showed the highest activity among the metals tested, followed by gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co). 
2. The materials were characterized using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption at 77 K, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, UV-Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XANES and EXAFS).
3. Among the metal oxide catalysts tested, chromium on MCM-41 (Cr-MCM-41) demonstrated the highest activity in the CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, yielding propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%.
4. It was proposed that chromium in tetrahedral coordination acted as an active monochromate species, which was reduced to chromium in octahedral coordination, forming a less active polychromate species during the reaction.
5. Deactivated catalysts were regenerated through a treatment with gaseous oxygen, leading to the reoxidation of the chromium(III) species back to chromium(VI) species.

1. 在二氧化碳脱氢化丙烷中，铬（Cr）在所测试的金属中表现出最高活性，随后是镓（Ga）、镍（Ni）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锰（Mn）和钴（Co）。  
2. 材料通过X射线衍射（XRD）、77 K氮吸附、漫反射紫外可见光谱、紫外拉曼光谱以及X射线吸收光谱（XANES和EXAFS）等技术进行了表征。  
3. 在所测试的金属氧化物催化剂中，MCM-41上的铬（Cr-MCM-41）在二氧化碳脱氢化丙烷中的活性最高，生成丙烯的转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。  
4. 提出，在反应过程中，四面体配位的铬（Cr）作为活性单铬酸盐物种存在，被还原为八面体配位的铬（Cr），形成较不活跃的多铬酸盐物种。  
5. 通过氧气气体处理对失活催化剂进行再生，导致铬（III）物种被氧化回铬（VI）物种。
