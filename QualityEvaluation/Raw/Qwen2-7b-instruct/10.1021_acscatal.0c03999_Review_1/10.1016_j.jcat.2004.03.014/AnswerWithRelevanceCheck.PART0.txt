          [1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr (57), Ga (46), Ni (46), V (40), Fe (51), Mn (47), and Co (45) on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method (number in the parentheses shows Si/M ratios determined by ICP), among which Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehy- drogenation of C3H8."
          [2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
          [3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
          [4] "Deacti- vated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."
          [5] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6 and at F = 0.134 mol(STP) h1 (Fig. 6)."
          [6] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT (Si/Cr = 50) showed a C3H8 conversion of 17.0% with a C3H6 yield of 15.9% with a gas mixture of N2CO2C3H8 at a molar ratio of 10:34:6 and at F = 0.134 mol(STP) h1 (Fig. 6)."

          Various metal species, including Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co, were tested for their activity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method. Among these, chromium (Cr) on MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, followed by gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co). The Cr-MCM-41-DHT catalyst, specifically with a Si/Cr ratio of 50, demonstrated a propane conversion of 17.0% and a propene yield of 15.9%. Chromium species in the catalyst evolved from tetrahedral coordination to form an active monochromate species, which was reduced to a less active octahedral coordination species during the reaction. Deactivated catalysts were revived through an oxygen treatment, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species. Carbon dioxide could also regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, even though the efficiency was lower than that of oxygen.

          在DHT方法制备的MCM-41上测试了Cr、Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co等金属物种在丙烷CO2脱氢反应中的活性。其中，Cr-MCM-41-DHT催化剂显示出了最高活性，随后是Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。具体而言，Si/Cr比例为50的Cr-MCM-41-DHT催化剂展示了丙烷转化率为17.0%，丙烯产率为15.9%。催化剂中的铬物种从四面体配位进化为活性单重铬酸盐物种，在反应过程中被还原为较不活跃的八面体配位的多重铬酸盐物种。失活的催化剂通过氧气处理恢复活性，导致Cr(III)物种重新氧化回Cr(VI)物种。二氧化碳也能从还原的Cr(III)O6八面体物种再生Cr(VI)O4四面体物种，尽管效率低于氧气。

          Similar to the first question, this question focuses on the comparison of various metal oxide catalysts, with chromium (Cr) on MCM-41-DHT showing the highest activity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane. The Cr-MCM-41 catalyst displayed a 30% conversion rate and selectivity greater than 90% for propene production. The chromium species evolved from tetrahedral coordination to an active monochromate species, which was reduced to a less active octahedral coordination species. Deactivated catalysts were revived through an oxygen treatment, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species. The regeneration process also involved the observation of a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species.

          类似于第一个问题，本问题同样关注了各种金属氧化物催化剂的比较，其中Cr-MCM-41-DHT催化剂在丙烷CO2脱氢反应中显示出最高活性。Cr-MCM-41催化剂的丙烷转化率为30%，丙烯选择性大于90%。催化剂中的铬物种从四面体配位进化为活性单重铬酸盐物种，在反应过程中被还原为较不活跃的八面体配位的多重铬酸盐物种。失活的催化剂通过氧气处理恢复活性，导致Cr(III)物种重新氧化回Cr(VI)物种。再生过程还包括观察Cr(III)物种被氧化回Cr(VI)物种。
