[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr (57), Ga (46), Ni (46), V (40), Fe (51), Mn (47), and Co (45) on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method (number in the parentheses shows Si/M ratios determined by ICP), among which Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, fol- lowed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehy- drogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a yield above 15% with a high selectivity above 90% of propene."

[4] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active poly- chromate species during the reaction."

1. Among the tested metals (Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, Co) supported on MCM-41, Cr-MCM-41-DHT demonstrated the highest activity for CO2-ODHP, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. 
2. Cr-MCM-41-DHT achieved a propene yield above 15% with a selectivity above 90%.
3. Cr-MCM-41-DHT achieved a propene yield above 15% with a selectivity above 90%.
4. It is proposed that during the reaction, Cr(VI) species in tetrahedral coordination act as an active monochromate species, which is reduced to Cr(III) species in octahedral coordination as a less active poly-chromate species.
5. The deactivated catalyst was revived by an oxygen treatment, which led to the reoxidation of Cr(III) species back to Cr(VI) species.
6. Both oxygen and carbon dioxide can regenerate Cr(VI)O4 tetrahedra from reduced Cr(III)O6 octahedra, with oxygen being more efficient than carbon dioxide.
7. It is concluded that during the reaction, propane is dehydrogenated to propene by Cr(IV)O4 tetrahedra, which are simultaneously reduced to Cr(III)O6 octahedra.

1. 在测试的金属（Cr、Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn、Co）中，Cr-MCM-41-DHT在CO2-ODHP中的活性最高，其次是Ga、Ni、V、Fe、Mn和Co。
2. Cr-MCM-41-DHT实现了丙烯产率超过15%，选择性超过90%。
3. Cr-MCM-41-DHT实现了丙烯产率超过15%，选择性超过90%。
4. 假设在反应过程中，Cr(VI)四面体配合物物种作为活性单重铬酸盐物种存在，随后被还原为Cr(III)八面体配合物物种，作为较不活跃的多重铬酸盐物种。
5. 催化剂失活后通过氧气处理恢复活性，导致Cr(III)物种重新氧化回Cr(VI)物种。
6. 氧气和二氧化碳都能从还原的Cr(III)六面体物种再生Cr(VI)四面体物种，但氧气的效率高于二氧化碳。
7. 结论是在反应过程中，丙烷由Cr(IV)四面体物种脱氢化为丙烯，同时Cr(IV)物种被还原为Cr(III)六面体物种。
