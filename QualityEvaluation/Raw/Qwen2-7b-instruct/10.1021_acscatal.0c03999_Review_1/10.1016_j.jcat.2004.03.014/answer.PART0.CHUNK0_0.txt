[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr (57), Ga (46), Ni (46), V (40), Fe (51), Mn (47), and Co (45) on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method (number in the parentheses shows Si/M ratios determined by ICP), among which Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehy- drogenation of C3H8."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity among M-MCM-41 catalysts tested, resulting in the production of propene with a conversion of 30% and a selectivity above 90%."
[3] "It is suggested that Cr(VI) in tetrahedral coordination formed as an active monochromate species and reduced to Cr(III) in octahedral coordination as a less active polychromate species during the reaction."
[4] "Deacti- vated catalyst was regenerated by a treatment with gaseous oxygen, during which a reoxidation of the Cr(III) species to the Cr(VI) species was observed."

1. Among the tested metals on MCM-41 prepared by the DHT method, chromium (Cr) showed the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8). Other notable metals were gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co).

2. The Cr-MCM-41 catalyst demonstrated the highest activity, producing propene with a 30% conversion and a selectivity exceeding 90%.

3. Chromium species in the catalyst evolved from tetrahedral coordination to form active monochromate species during the reaction, which then reduced to less active octahedral coordination.

4. The deactivated catalyst was revived by treating it with oxygen gas, leading to the reoxidation of the Cr(III) species back to the Cr(VI) species.

1. 在使用DHT方法制备的MCM-41上测试的金属中，铬（Cr）在CO2裂解丙烷（C3H8）中的活性最高。其他值得注意的金属有镓（Ga）、镍（Ni）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锰（Mn）和钴（Co）。

2. Cr-MCM-41催化剂显示出最高的活性，产生丙烯，转化率为30%，选择性超过90%。

3. 催化剂中的铬物种从四面体协调进化为形成活性单铬酸盐物种，在反应过程中，随后减少到较不活跃的八面体协调。

4. 失活的催化剂通过用氧气处理恢复活力，导致Cr(III)物种重新氧化回Cr(VI)物种。
