[1] "In this study, we evaluated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (ODHP) using a variety of metal oxide catalysts, including Cr2O3, Co3O4, Fe2O3, and CuO."
[2] "The CO2-ODHP activity was found to be highest for the Cr2O3 catalysts, followed by Co3O4, Fe2O3, and CuO."
[3] "Cr2O3 catalysts showed high activity, but their selectivity for propylene was lower compared to the other catalysts."
[4] "The key factors influencing the catalytic performance were identified as the metal loading, support type, and the nature of the metal oxide."
[5] "The evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalysts was observed to be influenced by the metal loading and support properties."
[6] "As the metal loading increased, the formation of Cr3+ species also increased, leading to higher propylene selectivity."
[7] "However, the support type had a significant impact on the stability of the catalyst, affecting both activity and selectivity."

The comparative analysis of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals that chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts exhibit the highest activity, followed by cobalt oxide (Co3O4), iron oxide (Fe2O3), and copper oxide (CuO). The selectivity for propylene production is notably lower for Cr2O3 compared to the other catalysts. Key factors affecting catalytic performance include metal loading, support type, and the nature of the metal oxide. As the metal loading increases, the formation of Cr3+ species enhances propylene selectivity. However, the support type significantly influences catalyst stability, impacting both activity and selectivity.

在对CO2-ODHP的氧化脱氢作用进行的多种金属氧化物催化剂比较分析中，发现铬氧化物（Cr2O3）催化剂的活性最高，其次是钴氧化物（Co3O4）、铁氧化物（Fe2O3）和铜氧化物（CuO）。Cr2O3催化剂的丙烯选择性明显低于其他催化剂。影响催化性能的关键因素包括金属负载、支持类型和金属氧化物的性质。随着金属负载的增加，Cr3+物种的形成增加，从而提高了丙烯选择性。然而，支持类型显著影响催化剂稳定性，影响活性和选择性。
