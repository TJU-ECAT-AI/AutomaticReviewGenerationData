1. Various metal oxide catalysts such as Cr2O3, CuO, and Al2O3 were tested for CO2-ODHP. Among them, Cr2O3 catalysts demonstrated higher activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP compared to CuO and Al2O3. The catalytic performance of Cr2O3 catalysts was found to be significantly influenced by the loading and support properties. Additionally, the evolution of chromium species within supported Cr2O3 catalysts was investigated as a function of loading and support characteristics.
