1. Various metal oxide catalysts such as supported Cr2O3, ZnO, CuO, NiO, and Fe2O3 were compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The factors affecting their catalytic performance included metal loading, support material, and the presence of metal oxide species. 
2. Chromium (Cr) species evolved during the reaction process significantly influenced the catalytic performance of Cr2O3 catalysts. Higher Cr2O3 loading led to decreased selectivity towards propylene production.
3. The support properties of the catalysts had a substantial impact on their stability and activity. Certain supports enhanced the performance of Cr2O3 catalysts in CO2-ODHP.

1. 包括支持Cr2O3、ZnO、CuO、NiO和Fe2O3在内的各种金属氧化物催化剂被用来比较在CO2-ODHP中的活性和选择性。影响其催化性能的因素包括金属负载量、支撑材料以及金属氧化物种的存在。
2. 在Cr2O3催化剂中，铬（Cr）物种的演变对丙烯生产的选择性和活性有显著影响。较高的Cr2O3负载导致丙烯选择性降低。
3. 催化剂的支撑性质对它们的稳定性和活性有重大影响。某些支撑材料提高了Cr2O3催化剂在CO2-ODHP过程中的性能。
