1. Different metal oxide catalysts such as Cr2O3, CuO, MoO3, and WO3 were assessed for CO2-ODHP. Among these, Cr2O3 demonstrated the greatest activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, particularly under the examined conditions. The effectiveness and selectivity of Cr2O3 catalysts were found to be contingent upon the chromium loading and support characteristics. Additionally, changes in chromium species were noted based on the loading level, impacting the catalyst's performance.

1. 不同的金属氧化物催化剂，包括Cr2O3、CuO、MoO3和WO3，被评估用于CO2-ODHP。其中，Cr2O3在测试条件下表现出最高的活性和选择性。Cr2O3催化剂的有效性和选择性依赖于铬加载和支撑特性。此外，根据加载水平观察到铬物种的变化，影响了催化剂的性能。

2. The comparative analysis revealed that Cr2O3 catalysts outperformed other metal oxides in terms of both activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The specific performance was attributed to the precise control of chromium loading and the properties of the support material, which facilitated the formation of stable chromium species essential for the efficient conversion of propane to propylene while minimizing unwanted side reactions. The study also underscored the importance of understanding the detailed mechanisms governing the behavior of chromium species under different loading conditions, as this knowledge could guide the optimization of catalyst design for enhanced CO2-ODHP efficiency.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comparative analysis of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP reveals that chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts exhibit the highest activity, followed by cobalt oxide (Co3O4), iron oxide (Fe2O3), and copper oxide (CuO). The selectivity for propylene production is notably lower for Cr2O3 compared to the other catalysts. Key factors affecting catalytic performance include metal loading, support type, and the nature of the metal oxide. As the metal loading increases, the formation of Cr3+ species enhances propylene selectivity. However, the support type significantly influences catalyst stability, impacting both activity and selectivity.
