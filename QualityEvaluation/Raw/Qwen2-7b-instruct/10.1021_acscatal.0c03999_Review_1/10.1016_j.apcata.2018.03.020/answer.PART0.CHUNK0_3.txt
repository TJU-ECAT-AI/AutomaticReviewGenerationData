[1] "In this study, we investigated the effect of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction of propane over various metal oxide catalysts."
[2] "The results showed that the Cr/ZrO2 catalysts exhibited high activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP."
[3] "The key factors influencing their catalytic performance were identified as the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties."

The study focused on assessing how CO2 impacts the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using different metal oxide catalysts. It was found that Cr/ZrO2 catalysts demonstrated superior activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. The main factors affecting the catalytic performance were determined to be the transformation of chromium species within supported Cr2O3 catalysts, depending on the loading and support characteristics.
