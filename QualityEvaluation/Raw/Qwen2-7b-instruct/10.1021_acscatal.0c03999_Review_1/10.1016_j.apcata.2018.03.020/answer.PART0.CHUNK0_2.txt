The study focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) using Cr/ZrO2 catalysts with varying chromium loadings and zirconia support characteristics. It was found that these catalysts demonstrated high efficiency in the ODHP process, with the performance significantly influenced by the chromium loading and zirconia support properties. Increasing chromium loading led to improved activity and selectivity for CO2 production. Additionally, the presence of carbon dioxide in the reaction mixture further boosted the catalytic performance.
