<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study investigated the impact of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) process of propane using Cr/ZrO2 catalysts. Various metal oxide catalysts were compared for their activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. The formation of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts was affected by the catalyst's loading and support characteristics.
