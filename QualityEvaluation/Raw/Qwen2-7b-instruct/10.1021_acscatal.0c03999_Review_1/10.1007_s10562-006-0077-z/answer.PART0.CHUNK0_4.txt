[1] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[2] "The b polymorph of Ga2O3 was taken as the active support due to its high dehydrogenation activity, thermal stability, and relatively high specific surface area."
[3] "The deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition, which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity."
[4] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."
[5] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption."

The comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted olefin decarbonylation (ODHP) shows that chromium and gallium oxides are promising due to their high activity and selectivity. Chromium is deposited on the gallium oxide surface, enhancing the catalyst's resistance to coke deposition by reducing surface acidity. The gallium oxide's high dehydrogenation activity and stability make it an effective support for chromium oxide, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation activity. The strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface decreases upon chromium deposition, which likely contributes to the catalyst's improved performance.

对于CO2辅助的烯烃脱羰基化（ODHP），铬和镓氧化物被认为是有前景的催化剂，因为它们具有高活性和选择性。铬被沉积在镓氧化物表面，通过降低表面酸性来增强催化剂的抗结焦性能。镓氧化物的高脱氢活性和稳定性使其成为铬氧化物的有效支撑材料，从而提高了脱氢活性。催化剂表面的Lewis酸中心强度在铬沉积后降低，这可能有助于催化剂性能的改善。
