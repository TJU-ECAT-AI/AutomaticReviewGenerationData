1. Various metal oxide catalysts, including SiO2, Al2O3, mesoporous materials like MCM-41, and carbonaceous materials, were utilized as supports in CO2-ODHP. Chromium oxide deposition on the surface of b-Ga2O3 catalysts significantly improves propene yield and reduces coke deposition.

2. Chromium content impacts the catalyst's performance. Up to 6.8 wt% chromium loading enhances propene yield, but beyond this point, the yield decreases likely due to a reduced surface area of the catalyst.

3. CO2 has a positive effect on propane dehydrogenation above 848 K, increasing both propene yield and propane conversion compared to inert gas atmospheres.

4. The high activity of these catalysts stems from the synergistic effect of gallium and chromium oxide's dehydrogenation capabilities.

5. Deposition of chromium oxide on b-Ga2O3 surfaces boosts resistance against coke deposition, possibly by reducing surface acidity.

1. 不同的金属氧化物催化剂，包括SiO2、Al2O3、介孔材料如MCM-41以及碳基材料，被用作CO2-ODHP的支持物。在b-Ga2O3催化剂表面沉积铬氧化物显著提高了丙烯产量，并减少了焦炭沉积。

2. 铬含量影响催化剂性能。在6.8 wt%铬负载范围内，丙烯产量逐渐增加，但超过这个点后，产量下降，这可能是因为催化剂表面积减小。

3. 在848 K以上，CO2对丙烷脱氢反应有积极影响，提高丙烯产量和丙烷转化率，与惰性气体大气相比。

4. 这些催化剂的高活性源自镓和铬氧化物协同脱氢的能力。

5. 在b-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物增强了抗焦炭沉积能力，可能通过降低表面酸性实现。
