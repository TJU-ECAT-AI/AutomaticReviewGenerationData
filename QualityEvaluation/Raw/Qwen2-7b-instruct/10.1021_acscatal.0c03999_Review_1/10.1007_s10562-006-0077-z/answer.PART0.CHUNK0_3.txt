[1] "The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane."
[2] "It is clear that the deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the average yield of propene."
[3] "Based on the analogy between Ga2O3 and Al2O3, we suggest that deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 generates surface Cr3+ species highly active in the dehydrogenation process."
[4] "Moreover, the deposition of Cr decreases the strength of Lewis acid sites on the surface of the catalyst, which was confirmed by quantitative IR studies of pyridine adsorption."
[5] "In the presence of CO2, the average yield of propene increments in the whole temperature range, while in the absence of CO2 it increases linearly up to 848 K and then declined."
[6] "However, at higher temperatures the decrease was more significant in the presence of CO2."
[7] "On the other hand, the molar ratio of H2/C3H6 in the presence of CO2 is lower than that in He, and is below 1.0 at 773K."
[8] "Such results suggest that the reverse water-gas shift reaction may proceed simultaneously with dehydrogenation of propane."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials, exhibit high activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the surface properties of the catalysts, specifically the generation of active Cr3+ species on the surface of b-Ga2O3. Deposition of chromium oxide reduces the surface acidity, enhancing the resistance to coke deposition. CO2 plays a crucial role in promoting the ODHP process, increasing the yield of propene and suppressing coke formation at higher temperatures. This is likely due to the facilitation of propene desorption and the simultaneous occurrence of the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which competes with the ODHP process.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是以b-Ga2O3为载体的铬氧化物材料，在二氧化碳辅助下进行丙烷脱氢反应（ODHP）时表现出高活性和选择性。影响这些催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括催化剂表面的性质，特别是在b-Ga2O3表面上生成活性Cr3+物种。在表面上沉积铬氧化物可以降低表面酸性，从而增强对焦炭沉积的抵抗力。CO2在促进ODHP过程中起着关键作用，提高了丙烯的产率，并在较高温度下抑制了焦炭的形成。这可能是因为促进了丙烯的脱附以及与ODHP过程同时发生的逆水煤气变换反应的竞争。
