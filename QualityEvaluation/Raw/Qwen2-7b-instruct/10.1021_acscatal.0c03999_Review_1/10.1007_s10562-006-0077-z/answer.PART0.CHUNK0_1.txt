[1] "Among them, chromium and gallium oxides based materials seem to be promising catalysts due to their high dehydrogenation activity and selectivity."
[2] "It has been found that deposition of chromium oxide enhances the dehydrogenation activity and resistance to coke deposition."
[3] "The high catalytic activity of these catalysts arises from the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides."
[4] "Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition, which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity."
[5] "CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition."
