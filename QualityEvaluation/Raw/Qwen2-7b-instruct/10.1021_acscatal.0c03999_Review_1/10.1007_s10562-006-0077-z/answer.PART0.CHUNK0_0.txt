<p>The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity of these catalysts arises from the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides.</p>
<p>Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition,which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity.</p>
<p>CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.</p>

The study demonstrates that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane. The combination of gallium and chromium oxides contributes to the catalyst's efficiency. Depositing chromium oxide on the b-Ga2O3 surface improves the catalyst's resistance to coke formation, likely due to reduced surface acidity. Additionally, the presence of CO2 at temperatures above 848 K significantly boosts the yield of propene while mitigating coke deposition, thus enhancing overall catalytic performance.

研究显示，b-Ga2O3支持的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性和选择性。镓和铬氧化物的结合为催化剂提供了高效性。在b-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物能增强催化剂对结焦的抵抗力，可能是因为表面酸性降低。此外，在848 K以上的温度下，二氧化碳的存在显著提高了丙烯的产率，并部分抑制了结焦，从而提高了催化剂的整体催化性能。
