<p>The presented results lead to the following conclusions:b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials are active and selective catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane. The high catalytic activity of these catalysts arises from the dehydrogenating properties of both gallium and chromium oxides.</p>
<p>Deposition of chromium oxide on the surface of b-Ga2O3 enhances the resistance to coke deposition,which is caused probably by decreasing the surface acidity.</p>
<p>CO2 enhances the average yield of propene above 848 K and partially suppresses the catalyst deactivation by coke deposition.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study demonstrates that b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide catalysts exhibit high activity and selectivity in the dehydrogenation of propane. The combination of gallium and chromium oxides contributes to the catalyst's efficiency. Depositing chromium oxide on the b-Ga2O3 surface improves the catalyst's resistance to coke formation, likely due to reduced surface acidity. Additionally, the presence of CO2 at temperatures above 848 K significantly boosts the yield of propene while mitigating coke deposition, thus enhancing overall catalytic performance.

研究显示，b-Ga2O3支持的铬氧化物催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中表现出高活性和选择性。镓和铬氧化物的结合为催化剂提供了高效性。在b-Ga2O3表面沉积铬氧化物能增强催化剂对结焦的抵抗力，可能是因为表面酸性降低。此外，在848 K以上的温度下，二氧化碳的存在显著提高了丙烯的产率，并部分抑制了结焦，从而提高了催化剂的整体催化性能。

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, including SiO2, Al2O3, mesoporous materials like MCM-41, and carbonaceous materials, were utilized as supports in CO2-ODHP. Chromium oxide deposition on the surface of b-Ga2O3 catalysts significantly improves propene yield and reduces coke deposition.

2. Chromium content impacts the catalyst's performance. Up to 6.8 wt% chromium loading enhances propene yield, but beyond this point, the yield decreases likely due to a reduced surface area of the catalyst.

3. CO2 has a positive effect on propane dehydrogenation above 848 K, increasing both propene yield and propane conversion compared to inert gas atmospheres.

4. The high activity of these catalysts stems from the synergistic effect of gallium and chromium oxide's dehydrogenation capabilities.

5. Deposition of chromium oxide on b-Ga2O3 surfaces boosts resistance against coke deposition, possibly by reducing surface acidity.

2. 铬含量影响催化剂性能。在6.8 wt%铬负载范围内，丙烯产量逐渐增加，但超过这个点后，产量下降，这可能是因为催化剂表面积减小。

3. 在848 K以上，CO2对丙烷脱氢反应有积极影响，提高丙烯产量和丙烷转化率，与惰性气体大气相比。

4. 这些催化剂的高活性源自镓和铬氧化物协同脱氢的能力。

[7] "On the other hand, the molar ratio of H2/C3H6 in the presence of CO2 is lower than that in He, and is below 1.0 at 773K."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly b-Ga2O3 supported chromium oxide materials, exhibit high activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the surface properties of the catalysts, specifically the generation of active Cr3+ species on the surface of b-Ga2O3. Deposition of chromium oxide reduces the surface acidity, enhancing the resistance to coke deposition. CO2 plays a crucial role in promoting the ODHP process, increasing the yield of propene and suppressing coke formation at higher temperatures. This is likely due to the facilitation of propene desorption and the simultaneous occurrence of the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which competes with the ODHP process.

1. 各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是以b-Ga2O3为载体的铬氧化物材料，在二氧化碳辅助下进行丙烷脱氢反应（ODHP）时表现出高活性和选择性。影响这些催化剂催化性能的关键因素包括催化剂表面的性质，特别是在b-Ga2O3表面上生成活性Cr3+物种。在表面上沉积铬氧化物可以降低表面酸性，从而增强对焦炭沉积的抵抗力。CO2在促进ODHP过程中起着关键作用，提高了丙烯的产率，并在较高温度下抑制了焦炭的形成。这可能是因为促进了丙烯的脱附以及与ODHP过程同时发生的逆水煤气变换反应的竞争。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comparison of metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted olefin decarbonylation (ODHP) shows that chromium and gallium oxides are promising due to their high activity and selectivity. Chromium is deposited on the gallium oxide surface, enhancing the catalyst's resistance to coke deposition by reducing surface acidity. The gallium oxide's high dehydrogenation activity and stability make it an effective support for chromium oxide, leading to enhanced dehydrogenation activity. The strength of Lewis acid sites on the catalyst surface decreases upon chromium deposition, which likely contributes to the catalyst's improved performance.

对于CO2辅助的烯烃脱羰基化（ODHP），铬和镓氧化物被认为是有前景的催化剂，因为它们具有高活性和选择性。铬被沉积在镓氧化物表面，通过降低表面酸性来增强催化剂的抗结焦性能。镓氧化物的高脱氢活性和稳定性使其成为铬氧化物的有效支撑材料，从而提高了脱氢活性。催化剂表面的Lewis酸中心强度在铬沉积后降低，这可能有助于催化剂性能的改善。
