[1] "Among various compositions, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%)."
[2] "The synthesized catalysts were characterized by various techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution to understand the physicochemical properties, and to correlate with the catalytic activity."
[3] "As can be noted from Fig. 3, in the case of lower loading sample (3 wt%), the Cr6+ is predominant with CrOCr framework species. The presence of nanoparticles or bulk crystals of Cr2O3 are also apparent from the UVvis DRS studies."
[4] "The UVvis DRS measurements of the synthesized samples were done under ambient conditions, and the obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra are found to be complex with several overlapping bands."
[5] "The XPS results fairly corroborated well with the XRD and UVvis DRS results."
[6] "The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts along with the amount of coke formed is displayed in Table 2."

The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst demonstrated the highest propane conversion (45%) and the best propylene product selectivity (75%) among the tested compositions. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts, including XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution, were characterized to correlate with their catalytic activity. The presence of nanoparticles or bulk crystals of Cr2O3 was evident in the UVvis DRS studies, particularly in the lower loading samples. The UVvis DRS spectra of the synthesized samples showed complex patterns with overlapping bands. The XPS results supported the findings from XRD and UVvis DRS analyses. The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts, along with the amount of coke formed, were also documented in Table 2.
