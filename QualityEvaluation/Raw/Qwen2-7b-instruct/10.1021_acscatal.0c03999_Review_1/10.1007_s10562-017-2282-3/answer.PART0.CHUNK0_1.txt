[1] "A series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various loadings of chromium (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by microwave irradiation and explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene utilizing CO2 as soft oxidant."
[2] "The microwave irradiation reduced the synthesis time and the resulting Cr-TUD-1 catalysts exhibited a high specific surface area of more than 600 m2 g1."
[3] "The synthesized catalysts were characterized by various techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution to understand the physicochemical properties, and to correlate with the catalytic activity."
[4] "Among various compositions, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%)."
[5] "The Cr-TUD-1 catalyst was also found to be quite stable up to 8 h of time-on-stream investigated."
[6] "The degree of crystallization of the chromium species is also considered to be another important factor in the dehydrogenation reactions."
[7] "As revealed by the characterization techniques, the inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species are very crucial for the observed better catalytic activity of these materials."

Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly those containing chromium, were compared for their activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance included the loading of chromium, the properties of the support material, and the transformation of chromium species. Specifically, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst demonstrated the highest activity with 45% propane conversion and 75% propylene selectivity. This catalyst was also noted for its stability over 8 hours of operation. The crystallization degree of chromium species was found to be a critical factor in dehydrogenation reactions. Moreover, the inter-convertibility of Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species was essential for the observed enhanced catalytic activity of these materials.
