Answer: Various metal oxide catalysts, particularly chromium oxide supported on different carriers, have been compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the nature of chromium species, their loading, and the properties of the support. Chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts evolve differently based on loading and support characteristics. For instance, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst demonstrated a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%). This was attributed to the inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species, which are crucial for the observed catalytic activity. The degree of crystallization of the chromium species also plays a role in the dehydrogenation reactions. The TUD-1 structure, which encapsulates chromium nanoparticles in a porous silica matrix with high dispersion, contributes to maintaining better catalytic performance.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是铬氧化物支持在不同载体上，对于二氧化碳氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）的活性和选择性进行了比较。影响它们催化性能的关键因素包括铬物种的性质、负载以及支持体的特性。支持Cr2O3催化剂中的铬物种根据负载和支持特性的不同而演变。例如，7% Cr-TUD-1催化剂表现出较高的丙烷转化率（45%），丙烯产品选择性较高（75%）。这归因于可以互换的Cr6+到Cr3+/2+物种，这些物种对于观察到的催化活性至关重要。铬物种的结晶度也影响脱氢反应。TUD-1结构通过封装在多孔硅酸盐骨架中高度分散的铬纳米颗粒来贡献更好的催化性能。

Various metal oxide catalysts, specifically Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with different chromium loadings (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%), were prepared using microwave irradiation for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 as the soft oxidant. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution techniques. These analyses helped understand the physicochemical properties and correlate them with catalytic activity. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst demonstrated the highest propane conversion (45%) with a propylene product selectivity of 75%. It also showed remarkable stability over an 8-hour reaction period. The inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species were pivotal for the observed enhanced catalytic activity. The TUD-1 structure enabled encapsulation of chromium nanoparticles with high dispersion, contributing to better catalytic performance. The 7 wt% catalyst maintained its activity without significant decline even after 8 hours. At 600°C, the 9% catalyst facilitated a high propane conversion with increased CO2 production. Higher chromium loading samples (7 and 9%) experienced a greater decrease in surface area and pore volume due to coke formation, trapping metal surfaces within the pores. CO2 played a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, impacting the activity and stability of the catalysts. The reaction in helium resulted in a significant decrease in activity, attributed to coke formation and complete reduction of chromium species.
