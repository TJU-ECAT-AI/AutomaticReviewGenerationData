<p>A series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various loadings of chromium (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by microwave irradiation and explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene utilizing CO2 as soft oxidant.</p>
<p>The synthesized catalysts were characterized by various techniques including XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution to understand the physicochemical properties, and to correlate with the catalytic activity.</p>
<p>Among various compositions, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%).</p>
<p>The Cr-TUD-1 catalyst was also found to be quite stable up to 8 h of time-on-stream investigated.</p>
<p>The inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species are very crucial for the observed better catalytic activity of these materials.</p>
<p>As revealed by the characterization techniques, the TUD-1 enables to encapsulate the chromium nanoparticles in the porous silica structure with high dispersion which help in maintaining the better catalytic performance.</p>
<p>The 7 wt% catalyst showed highest propane conversion and did not shown much drop in the catalytic activity even after 8 h of reaction time.</p>
<p>When the reaction was performed at 600 C over the 9% catalyst, a high conversion of propane with more CO2 were noted.</p>
<p>The specific surface area and pore volume of the used catalysts along with the amount of coke formed is displayed in Table 2.</p>
<p>All catalysts showed a decrease in the surface area and pore volume after the use mainly due to coke formation on the catalyst surface and in the pores.</p>
<p>The decrease in the surface area as well as pore volume is more in case of higher Cr loading samples (7 and 9%) where the pores are assumed to have coke deposits on the metal surfaces which are trapped in the pores.</p>
<p>To understand the significance of CO2 in the ODH of propane over Cr-TUD-1 catalysts, the reaction was performed at 550 C on 7 wt% catalyst in the presence and absence (with He) of CO2 under identical conditions.</p>
<p>The substantial decrease in the activity of the catalyst under He stream could be attributed to the amount of coke formed and complete reduction of the Cr species.</p>

Various metal oxide catalysts, specifically Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with different chromium loadings (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%), were prepared using microwave irradiation for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 as the soft oxidant. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, XPS, TEM, UVvis DRS, BET surface area, and pore size distribution techniques. These analyses helped understand the physicochemical properties and correlate them with catalytic activity. The 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst demonstrated the highest propane conversion (45%) with a propylene product selectivity of 75%. It also showed remarkable stability over an 8-hour reaction period. The inter-convertible Cr6+ to Cr3+/2+ species were pivotal for the observed enhanced catalytic activity. The TUD-1 structure enabled encapsulation of chromium nanoparticles with high dispersion, contributing to better catalytic performance. The 7 wt% catalyst maintained its activity without significant decline even after 8 hours. At 600°C, the 9% catalyst facilitated a high propane conversion with increased CO2 production. Higher chromium loading samples (7 and 9%) experienced a greater decrease in surface area and pore volume due to coke formation, trapping metal surfaces within the pores. CO2 played a crucial role in the oxidative dehydrogenation process, impacting the activity and stability of the catalysts. The reaction in helium resulted in a significant decrease in activity, attributed to coke formation and complete reduction of chromium species.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是通过微波辐射制备的不同铬含量（3、5、7和9 wt%）的Cr-TUD-1催化剂，用于丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应，利用二氧化碳作为软氧化剂。这些催化剂通过XRD、XPS、TEM、UVvis DRS、BET表面积和孔径分布技术进行了表征。这些分析有助于理解物理化学性质并与催化活性相关联。7% Cr-TUD-1催化剂表现出最高的丙烷转化率（45%），丙烯产品选择性为75%。它在8小时的反应时间内也显示出了出色的稳定性。可互换的Cr6+到Cr3+/2+物种对于观察到的增强催化活性至关重要。TUD-1结构允许将铬纳米颗粒封装在具有高分散性的多孔硅酸盐结构中，从而促进更好的催化性能。7 wt%催化剂在其活动性上保持稳定，即使在8小时后也没有显著下降。在600°C下，9%催化剂促进了高丙烷转化率和增加的CO2产生。更高铬含量样品（7和9%）的表面面积和孔体积出现了更大的减少，这是由于焦炭形成并捕获金属表面造成的。CO2在氧化脱氢过程中发挥了关键作用，影响了催化剂的活性和稳定性。在氦气中的反应导致活性显著下降，归因于焦炭形成和完全还原铬物种。
