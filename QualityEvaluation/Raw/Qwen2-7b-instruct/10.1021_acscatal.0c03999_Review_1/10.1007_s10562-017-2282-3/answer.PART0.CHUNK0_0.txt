[1] "A series of Cr-TUD-1 catalysts with various loadings of chromium (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) were prepared by microwave irradiation and explored for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene utilizing CO2 as soft oxidant."
[2] "Among various compositions, the 7% Cr-TUD-1 catalyst exhibited a high propane conversion (45%) with better propylene product selectivity (75%)."
[3] "The 7 wt% catalyst did not shown much drop in the catalytic activity even after 8 h of reaction time."
[4] "As can be noted from this figure, the ODH of propane with CO2 is a challenging catalytic technology and further studies are highly essential to make it commercially viable."
