[1] "The objective of the research reported here was to study chemical-physical and catalytic properties in dehydrogenation of isobutane of catalysts prepared by supporting means of increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina, both in the presence and in the absence of potash as the dopant."
[2] "The nature of chromium species in calcined catalysts was determined as the difference between the Cr61 and the total chromium loaded."
[3] "For CrO3 contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61 steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%)."
[4] "For even higher CrO3 contents, the increase in this species was much less marked."
[5] "This species was not dissolved by the treatment with water."
[6] "Also reported in Fig. 1 is the value obtained by first treating the calcined 15.3 wt% CrO3 catalyst with water, in order to remove the soluble Cr61 selectively, and then calcining the catalyst again at 600°C. The amount of soluble Cr61 was restored at the expense of the Cr31 species, which correspondingly decreased by a similar amount."

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP involves examining how their performance varies based on factors such as chromium species, loading, and support properties. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium species: The study shows that in samples calcined at 600°C, an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, consisting of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species. 

2. Chromium loading: The amount of soluble Cr61 increases steadily up to 2 wt% of CrO3. For higher CrO3 contents, the increase in soluble Cr61 is less pronounced. 

3. Support properties: The study indicates that the amount of soluble Cr61 is proportional to the surface area of the support. For higher CrO3 loadings, Cr31 species also appear, which are not dissolved by the treatment with water.

4. Potassium dopant: The addition of potassium leads to the formation of a potassium chromate phase, which occurs at the expense of dispersed Cr31 oxide and a-Cr2O3. The catalytic activity is generally inhibited by the addition of potassium, except for certain cases where it enhances activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. Soluble Cr61 forms as the amount of chromium oxide increases, reaching a maximum at around 1.5 wt% CrO3. Beyond this point, Cr31 species begin to appear and increase with higher CrO3 loading. These species' interactions with the support and their dissolution properties affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

在对不同金属氧化物催化剂进行CO2-ODHP反应的活性和选择性的比较时，关键因素包括铬物种、负载量和支持性质。主要影响催化剂催化性能的因素有：

1. 铬物种：研究发现，在600°C煅烧样品中，初始覆盖层由锚定在支持物上的Cr61物种和分散的Cr61及Cr31氧化物物种组成。

2. 铬负载量：随着CrO3含量增加到2 wt%，可溶性Cr61的含量逐渐上升至2 wt%（总CrO3含量为4 wt%）。对于更高CrO3含量，可溶性Cr61的增加幅度较小。

3. 支持性质：研究表明，支持物表面面积越大，可溶性Cr61含量越高。对于更高CrO3负载量，Cr31物种开始出现，并且不被水处理溶解。

4. 碱金属掺杂：添加钾会导致钾铬酸盐相形成，这会减少分散的Cr31氧化物和a-Cr2O3的含量。通常情况下，钾的添加会抑制催化剂活性，但在某些情况下可以提高活性。

支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和支持性质。当铬氧化物含量增加到约1.5 wt%时，可溶性Cr61形成并达到最大值。超过这个点，随着CrO3含量增加，Cr31物种开始出现。这些物种与支持物的相互作用及其溶解特性会影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化剂活性和选择性。
