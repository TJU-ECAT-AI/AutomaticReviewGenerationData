1. The research aimed to examine the chemical and physical properties of catalysts made by adding increasing amounts of chromium oxide to commercial alumina, either with or without potassium as a dopant. The study focused on their catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane.

2. Chromium oxide species initially anchor to the alumina support during calcination at 600°C, forming a complex mixture including Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species.

3. In the samples, the amount of a-Cr2O3 crystalline structure is minimal, particularly for lower chromium oxide loadings, but increases with higher loadings.

4. The increase in the soluble Cr61 species becomes less pronounced at higher chromium oxide contents.

5. This soluble Cr61 species does not chemically interact with the alumina support.

6. The Cr31 species is undetected through X-ray diffraction methods, suggesting it exists in an amorphous or microcrystalline phase.

7. The content of the Cr31 species decreases as the soluble Cr61 species increases, especially at chromium oxide contents above 4 wt%.

8. The amount of soluble Cr61 increases steadily up to 2 wt% at a 4 wt% overall chromium oxide content.

9. The restoration of the soluble Cr61 amount leads to a decrease in the Cr31 species content, which is removed to make room for the soluble Cr61.

1. 研究旨在研究通过向商用氧化铝添加不同量的铬氧化物制备催化剂，并在存在或不存在钾作为掺杂剂的情况下，催化剂的化学和物理性质。研究重点是它们在异丁烷脱氢反应中的催化活性。

2. 在600°C的煅烧过程中，铬氧化物物种最初锚定在氧化铝支持物上，形成包括Cr61和Cr31氧化物物种在内的复杂混合物。

3. 在样品中，结晶a-Cr2O3的量相对较少，特别是对于较低的铬氧化物负载，但随着负载量的增加而增加。

4. 随着铬氧化物含量的提高，可溶性Cr61物种的增加趋于减缓。

5. 这种可溶性Cr61物种不会与氧化铝基体化学作用。

6. 通过X射线衍射方法无法检测到Cr31物种，表明它以非晶态或微晶形式存在。

7. Cr31物种的含量随着铬氧化物含量超过4 wt%而减少，尤其是当铬氧化物含量高于4 wt%时。

8. 当总体铬氧化物含量为4 wt%时，可溶性Cr61含量稳定增加至2 wt%。

9. 可溶性Cr61含量的恢复导致Cr31物种含量的下降，这些物种被去除以腾出空间容纳可溶性Cr61。
