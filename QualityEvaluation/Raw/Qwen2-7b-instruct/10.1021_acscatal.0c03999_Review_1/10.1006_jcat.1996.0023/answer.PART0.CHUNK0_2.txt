[1] "The objective of the research reported here was to study the chemical-physical and catalytic properties in dehydrogenation of isobutane of catalysts prepared by supporting means of increasing amounts of chromium oxide on a commercial alumina, both in the presence and in the absence of potash as the dopant."
[2] "The catalytic tests were carried out in a laboratory, tubular-flow, stainless steel reactor, at atmospheric pressure."
[3] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 6008C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."
[4] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt% CrO3) which showed a lower activity."
[5] "For CrO3 contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61 steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%)."
[6] "For even higher CrO3 contents, the increase in this species was much less marked."
[7] "This species was not dissolved by the treatment with water."
[8] "The amount of soluble Cr61 was restored at the expense of the Cr31 species, which correspondingly decreased by a similar amount."

1. The research aimed to examine the chemical-physical and catalytic characteristics of isobutane dehydrogenation catalysts, featuring increasing chromium oxide amounts on commercial alumina, with or without potash doping. The catalytic tests were conducted in a laboratory setting using a tubular-flow, stainless steel reactor under atmospheric pressure.

2. The catalytic performance was found to be directly proportional to the total chromium content, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt%), which exhibited reduced activity.

3. The initial coverage on the alumina support included Cr61 species attached to the support, along with dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species.

4. The amount of soluble Cr61 increased steadily up to 2 wt% for CrO3 contents above 2 wt%, reaching a maximum level of 1.5 wt% for a 15.3 wt% CrO3 content. Further increases in CrO3 content resulted in a less pronounced rise in soluble Cr61.

5. For higher CrO3 contents, the soluble Cr61 was restored at the expense of the Cr31 species, causing a similar decrease in the Cr31 content.

1. 研究的目标是研究在商业氧化铝上通过增加不同量的铬氧化物并使用或不使用钾作为掺杂剂制备的催化剂，在异丁烷脱氢反应中的化学物理和催化性质。在实验室中，使用不锈钢管式流化床反应器并在常压下进行催化测试。

2. 发现催化剂活性与总铬含量成正比，除了15.3 wt%的CrO3负载时活性较低的情况。

3. 铝支撑物的初始覆盖层包含固定在支撑物上的Cr61物种，以及分散的Cr61和Cr31氧化物种。

4. 对于超过2 wt%的CrO3含量，可溶性Cr61的量稳定地增加到2 wt%，对于15.3 wt%的CrO3含量达到最大值1.5 wt%。更高的CrO3含量导致可溶性Cr61的增加相对较小。

5. 对于更高CrO3含量的情况，通过水处理恢复了可溶性Cr61的量，同时相应减少了Cr31的量。
