[1] "An approximate estimate of the experimental error of this technique has been evaluated by repeated analysis, and has been found to correspond to approximately 10% of the average value."
[2] "The activity was found to be proportional to the overall amount of chromium, except for the highest CrO3 loading (15.3 wt%) which showed a lower activity."
[3] "For CrO3 contents higher than 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61 steadily increased up to a content of 2 wt% (reached for an overall CrO3 content of 4 wt%)."
[4] "The amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3 and of undetected Cr31 oxide (determined by difference between the overall amount of Cr31 oxide, determined by titration, and the amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3, determined by X-ray diffractive analysis) is also reported in Fig. 1."
[5] "It is proposed that in samples calcined at 600°C an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, constituted of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species."

1. The experimental error for the technique described in the document corresponds to approximately 10% of the average value, as determined through repeated analysis.
2. The catalytic activity is directly proportional to the total amount of chromium, except for samples with the highest chromium oxide loading (15.3 wt%), which exhibited a lower activity.
3. As the chromium oxide content increases above 2 wt%, the amount of soluble Cr61 gradually rises, reaching a peak at 4 wt% CrO3.
4. The amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3 and undetected Cr31 oxide, calculated by subtracting the crystalline a-Cr2O3 amount from the total Cr31 oxide amount determined through titration, is presented in Fig. 1.
5. The proposed model suggests that at 600°C, an initial layer of chromium species forms on the alumina support, including Cr61 species attached to the support, and dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species.

1. 此技术方法的实验误差约为平均值的10%，这是通过重复分析得出的结果。
2. 催化剂的活性与总铬含量成正比，除了15.3 wt%的最高铬氧化物负载，其活性较低。
3. 当铬氧化物含量超过2 wt%时，可溶性Cr61的量逐渐增加，峰值出现在4 wt% CrO3时。
4. 等式1中报告了结晶a-Cr2O3和未检测到的Cr31氧化物的量，这是通过从滴定确定的总Cr31氧化物量减去通过X射线衍射分析确定的结晶a-Cr2O3量计算得出的。
5. 模型假设，在600°C时，铝氧支持物上形成初始层的铬物种，包括附着在支持物上的Cr61物种，以及分散的Cr61和Cr31氧化物物种。
