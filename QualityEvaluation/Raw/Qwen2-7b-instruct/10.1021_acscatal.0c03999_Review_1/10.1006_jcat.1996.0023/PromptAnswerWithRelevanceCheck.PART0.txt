[3] "The amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3 and of undetected Cr31 oxide (determined by difference between the overall amount of Cr31 oxide, determined by titration, and the amount of crystalline a-Cr2O3, determined by X-ray diffraction) is also reported in Fig. 1."
[4] "The amount of grafted Cr61 determined at 6008C was proportional to the surface area, and was in any case lower than the amount that would theoretically be necessary to complete the coverage of the alumina surface."
[5] "For even higher CrO3 contents, the increase in this species was much less marked."
[6] "For overall CrO3 loadings higher than 4 wt%, Cr31 was also found, and its content increased linearly with increasing chromium oxide loading."
[7] "Also reported in Fig. 1 is the value obtained by first treating the calcined 15.3 wt% CrO3 catalyst with water, in order to remove the soluble Cr61 selectively, and then calcining the catalyst again at 6008C. The amount of soluble Cr61 was restored at the expense of the Cr31 species, which correspondingly decreased by a similar amount."

1. The research aimed to investigate the chemical, physical, and catalytic properties of isobutane dehydrogenation catalysts, focusing on chromium oxide supported on commercial alumina, both in the presence and absence of potassium as a dopant. The nature of chromium species was determined by comparing the total chromium loaded with the Cr61 component.

2. The amount of chromium species in calcined catalysts was quantified through the difference between the Cr61 species and the total chromium content.

3. The study revealed the presence of crystalline a-Cr2O3 and undetected Cr31 oxide, the latter being determined by subtracting the crystalline a-Cr2O3 amount from the total Cr31 oxide determined through titration.

4. The grafted Cr61 species' amount was found to be proportional to the surface area of the catalyst, and it was always less than the theoretical amount needed to cover the entire alumina surface.

5. As the chromium oxide loading increased, the increase in the soluble Cr61 species became less pronounced.

6. For catalysts with higher chromium oxide loadings exceeding 4 wt%, Cr31 was identified, and its concentration increased linearly with the chromium oxide loading.

7. Treating the 15.3 wt% CrO3 catalyst with water to selectively remove soluble Cr61 led to a restoration of this species, at the cost of Cr31, which consequently decreased by a similar amount.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP involves examining how their performance varies based on factors such as chromium species, loading, and support properties. The key factors influencing their catalytic performance include:

1. Chromium species: The study shows that in samples calcined at 600°C, an initial coverage of the alumina support occurs, consisting of Cr61 species anchored to the support, and of dispersed Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species. 

2. Chromium loading: The amount of soluble Cr61 increases steadily up to 2 wt% of CrO3. For higher CrO3 contents, the increase in soluble Cr61 is less pronounced. 

3. Support properties: The study indicates that the amount of soluble Cr61 is proportional to the surface area of the support. For higher CrO3 loadings, Cr31 species also appear, which are not dissolved by the treatment with water.

4. Potassium dopant: The addition of potassium leads to the formation of a potassium chromate phase, which occurs at the expense of dispersed Cr31 oxide and a-Cr2O3. The catalytic activity is generally inhibited by the addition of potassium, except for certain cases where it enhances activity.

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts depends on the loading and support properties. Soluble Cr61 forms as the amount of chromium oxide increases, reaching a maximum at around 1.5 wt% CrO3. Beyond this point, Cr31 species begin to appear and increase with higher CrO3 loading. These species' interactions with the support and their dissolution properties affect the catalyst's activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP reactions.

在对不同金属氧化物催化剂进行CO2-ODHP反应的活性和选择性的比较时，关键因素包括铬物种、负载量和支持性质。主要影响催化剂催化性能的因素有：

1. 铬物种：研究发现，在600°C煅烧样品中，初始覆盖层由锚定在支持物上的Cr61物种和分散的Cr61及Cr31氧化物物种组成。

2. 铬负载量：随着CrO3含量增加到2 wt%，可溶性Cr61的含量逐渐上升至2 wt%（总CrO3含量为4 wt%）。对于更高CrO3含量，可溶性Cr61的增加幅度较小。

3. 支持性质：研究表明，支持物表面面积越大，可溶性Cr61含量越高。对于更高CrO3负载量，Cr31物种开始出现，并且不被水处理溶解。

4. 碱金属掺杂：添加钾会导致钾铬酸盐相形成，这会减少分散的Cr31氧化物和a-Cr2O3的含量。通常情况下，钾的添加会抑制催化剂活性，但在某些情况下可以提高活性。

支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变取决于负载量和支持性质。当铬氧化物含量增加到约1.5 wt%时，可溶性Cr61形成并达到最大值。超过这个点，随着CrO3含量增加，Cr31物种开始出现。这些物种与支持物的相互作用及其溶解特性会影响CO2-ODHP反应中的催化剂活性和选择性。

1. The research aimed to examine the chemical and physical properties of catalysts made by adding increasing amounts of chromium oxide to commercial alumina, either with or without potassium as a dopant. The study focused on their catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane.

2. Chromium oxide species initially anchor to the alumina support during calcination at 600°C, forming a complex mixture including Cr61 and Cr31 oxide species.

3. In the samples, the amount of a-Cr2O3 crystalline structure is minimal, particularly for lower chromium oxide loadings, but increases with higher loadings.

4. The increase in the soluble Cr61 species becomes less pronounced at higher chromium oxide contents.

5. This soluble Cr61 species does not chemically interact with the alumina support.

6. The Cr31 species is undetected through X-ray diffraction methods, suggesting it exists in an amorphous or microcrystalline phase.

7. The content of the Cr31 species decreases as the soluble Cr61 species increases, especially at chromium oxide contents above 4 wt%.

8. The amount of soluble Cr61 increases steadily up to 2 wt% at a 4 wt% overall chromium oxide content.

9. The restoration of the soluble Cr61 amount leads to a decrease in the Cr31 species content, which is removed to make room for the soluble Cr61.
