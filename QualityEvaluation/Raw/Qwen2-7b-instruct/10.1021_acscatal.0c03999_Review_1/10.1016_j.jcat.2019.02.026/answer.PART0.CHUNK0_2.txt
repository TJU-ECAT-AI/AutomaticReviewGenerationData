1. Chromium-based catalysts, particularly chromium oxides, have been found to be highly active in CO2-ODHP reactions compared to catalysts based on indium, gallium, and vanadium. 

2. The synthesized materials feature a mesoporous structure and modified zirconia crystals with doped chromium species.

3. The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst, characterized by abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species, demonstrated the highest catalytic activity, achieving an initial conversion of 68% and a yield of 40.5%.

4. The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity, with the majority of its activity attributed to the dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species on the t-ZrO2 support.

5. Under real reaction conditions, the active sites for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 are the coordinatively unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites.

6. The active oxidative chromium species, which are the oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen from CO2 dissociation, play a crucial role in the reaction.

7. CO2 inhibits the reduction of Cr3+ species to Cr2+ species, preserving the active state of chromium species.

8. Methane and CO are primarily produced as byproducts from the reaction of propylene with CO2 on the active oxidative chromium sites.

9. The presence of CO2 primarily inhibits coke formation rather than eliminating it, due to the low rate of CO2 elimination of coke.
