1. Various transition metal oxide catalysts, including those based on indium, gallium, vanadium, and chromium, have been reported for use in the DHP reaction with CO2. Chromium oxides have been found to exhibit particularly high activity in these reactions.

2. The nature of CO2 interaction with dispersed chromium species varies depending on the type of support material (such as SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, zeolites, etc.). 

3. In the case of mixed Cr2O3AZrO2 oxide catalysts, CO2 has been observed to have a positive impact on the DHP reaction.

4. CO2 can oxidize active sites on the catalyst and stabilize it by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction.

5. A significant amount of CO2 consumes dissociated atomic hydrogen species on the surface, thereby reducing the availability of hydrogen species required for further deoxygenation of carbon-oxygen species, thus inhibiting chain growth and aromatization reactions.

6. Under real reaction conditions, the coordinationally unsaturated oligomeric/isolated Cr3+ sites with oxygen vacancies and active oxidative chromium sites are the primary catalytically active sites.

1. 各种过渡金属氧化物催化剂，包括基于铟、镓、钒和铬的催化剂，已被报道用于CO2-ODHP反应。铬氧化物在这些反应中表现出特别高的活性。

2. CO2与分散的铬物种之间的相互作用性质根据支持材料的不同（如二氧化硅、氧化铝、氧化锆、沸石等）而变化。

3. 对于混合Cr2O3AZrO2氧化物催化剂，CO2对ODHP反应显示出积极的影响。

4. CO2可以通过反向布杜瓦尔反应氧化催化剂上的活性位点并稳定催化剂，从而消除焦炭。

5. 大量的CO2消耗了表面的离散原子氢物种，因此减少了进一步脱氧碳-氧物种形成烃基物种所需的氢物种，从而抑制了链增长和芳构化反应。

6. 在实际反应条件下，与氧空位和活性氧化性铬位点相关的协调不饱和寡聚体/孤立的Cr3+位点是主要的催化活性位点。
