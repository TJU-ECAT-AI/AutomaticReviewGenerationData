[1] "Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+."
[2] "The regenerative cycles of the xCrAZrO2 catalyst are represented in Fig. S3. The propylene yield on the catalyst decreased from 40% to 27% after 300 min on stream in the first cycle."

[4] "The regenerative step was carried out with an O2 stream at 550 C for 0.5 h to reoxidize the reduced active chromium species and combust deposited carbon."
[5] "The coordination unsaturated oligomeric/isolated Cr3+ sites are the main catalytically active sites for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2."

1. Several studies have indicated that the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species, derived from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+, exhibit higher reactivity than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+.
2. The propylene yield on the xCrAZrO2 catalyst reduced from 40% to 27% after 300 minutes of continuous operation during the first regeneration cycle.
3. The degree of reduction of the surface chromium species can be assessed by the intensity of the Cr@O bonds in the Raman spectra.
4. The process of regenerating the catalyst involved treating it with an oxygen stream at 550°C for 0.5 hours to reoxidize the reduced active chromium species and burn off deposited carbon.
5. The coordination unsaturated oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ sites serve as the primary active sites for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.
6. The redox reaction at active oxidative chromium sites during real reaction conditions is initiated by the consumption of active oxygen on these sites by hydrogen species produced from DHP.
7. The principal impact of CO2 presence is to inhibit, rather than eliminate, coke formation.
