[1] "Several groups have reported that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ is more active than the reduced form of initial isolated Cr6+."
[2] "The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst with abundant dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species showed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts studied; initial conversion 68% and yield 40.5% were obtained."
[3] "The oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species with activated oxygen are denoted as active oxidative chromium species, which are the main active sites of redox reaction."
[4] "The foremost effect of CO2 is inhibiting rather than eliminating coke."

1. Several studies have indicated that coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species derived from the reduction of initial polymeric Cr6+ are more active than those initially isolated Cr6+ species.

2. The 7CrAZrO2 catalyst, featuring a substantial amount of dispersed oligomeric Cr6+ species and isolated Cr6+ species, displayed the highest catalytic activity among the catalysts examined, achieving an initial conversion rate of 68% and a yield of 40.5%.

3. The active sites for redox reactions are characterized by oligomeric and isolated Cr3+ species that contain activated oxygen, referred to as active oxidative chromium species.

4. The presence of CO2 primarily serves to inhibit the formation of coke rather than eliminating it.

5. CO2 can oxidize active sites and stabilize the catalyst by eliminating coke through the reverse Boudouard reaction.

1. 几项研究显示，从初始聚集体Cr6+的还原产生的可配位不饱和Cr3+物种比初始孤立的Cr6+物种更活跃。

2. 具有大量分散的聚集体Cr6+物种和孤立的Cr6+物种的7CrAZrO2催化剂在所研究的催化剂中表现出最高的催化活性，实现了68%的初始转化率和40.5%的产率。

3. 红氧化反应的主要活性位点是含有激活氧的寡聚和孤立的Cr3+物种，被称为活性氧化铬物种。

4. CO2的主要作用是抑制焦炭的形成，而不是消除它。

5. CO2可以通过反布杜瓦尔反应去除活性位点，并通过消除焦炭来稳定催化剂。
