[1] "Mesoporous molecular sieve silicas with wormhole framework structures (e.g. MSU-X,1,2 and HMS3) are generally more active heterogeneous catalysts in comparison to their ordered hexagonal analogs (e.g. MCM-41,4 SBA-35 and SBA-156)."
[2] "The enhanced reactivity has been attributed, in part, to a pore network that is connected in three dimensions, allowing the guest molecules to more readily access reactive centers that have been designed into the framework surfaces."

Mesoporous molecular sieve silicas with wormhole framework structures, such as MSU-X, HMS3, etc., are typically more active heterogeneous catalysts compared to their ordered hexagonal counterparts. This enhanced reactivity is partly attributed to a three-dimensional interconnected pore network that facilitates easier access to reactive centers on the framework surfaces. MSU-X mesostructures exhibit structural stability even at high calcination temperatures exceeding 800°C. Recent research efforts have concentrated on creating thermally stable mesoporous silica molecular sieve silicas with wormhole frameworks using soluble silicate precursors.

具有隧道结构的介孔分子筛硅酸盐，如MSU-X、HMS3等，通常比其有序六边形类似物更具有活性的异质催化剂。这种增强的反应性部分归因于三维互连的孔网络，它使得客体分子能够更容易地接触到框架表面设计的活性中心。MSU-X微结构在超过800°C的煅烧温度下表现出结构稳定性。最近的研究重点集中在使用可溶性硅酸盐前体合成热稳定的介孔硅酸盐分子筛硅酸盐材料，具有隧道结构。
