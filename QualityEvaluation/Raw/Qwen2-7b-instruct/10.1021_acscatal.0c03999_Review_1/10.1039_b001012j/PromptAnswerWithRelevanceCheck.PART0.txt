[2] "The enhanced reactivity has been attributed, in part, to a pore network that is connected in three dimensions, allowing the guest molecules to more readily access reactive centers that have been designed into the framework surfaces."
[3] "One disadvantage of these pathways, as with other assembly pathways based on TEOS, is the high cost of the hydrolyzable silicon alkoxide precursor."
[4] "The present work demonstrates that mesoporous molecular sieve silicas equivalent in structure and thermal stability to MSU-X silicas (denoted MSU-XA) can in fact be prepared from soluble silicate precursors under the appropriate assembly conditions."
[5] "In a typical synthesis the surfactant and an amount of acid equivalent to the hydroxide content of the sodium silicate solution (e.g. 27% SiO2, 14% NaOH, Aldrich) are first mixed at ambient temperature and then added to the sodium silicate solution to form reactive silica in the presence of the surfactant."
[6] "Fig. 1 illustrates the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of as-synthesized and calcined MSU-XA silicas prepared at three different temperatures using Brij 56 [C16H33(EO)10H] as the structure-directing surfactant."
[7] "Further evidence for the wormhole framework pore structure of MSU-XA silicas is provided by the typical transmission electron micrograph (TEM) image shown in Fig. 2."

The literature does not provide specific data on how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP or detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. It focuses on the preparation and characterization of mesoporous silica molecular sieves with wormhole frameworks from soluble silicate precursors using non-ionic surfactants. The text emphasizes the enhanced reactivity of these materials compared to ordered hexagonal analogs, attributing it partly to their three-dimensional interconnected pore networks. However, it does not delve into the specifics requested regarding metal oxide catalysts or chromium species evolution.

文献没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中活性和选择性的具体比较数据，也没有详细描述在负载和支持性质变化下Cr2O3支持型铬催化剂中铬物种的演变情况。它主要关注从可溶性硅酸盐前体制备具有管状结构的介孔二氧化硅分子筛，并使用非离子表面活性剂作为结构导向剂。文本强调了这些材料与有序六边形类似物相比的增强反应性，部分归因于它们三维互联的孔网络。然而，它没有深入探讨所请求的有关金属氧化物催化剂或铬物种演变的具体信息。

The document discusses the synthesis of mesoporous silica molecular sieves with wormhole framework structures from soluble silicate precursors. These materials are generally more active heterogeneous catalysts compared to their ordered hexagonal counterparts. The enhanced reactivity is attributed to their three-dimensional pore network, which facilitates easier access to reactive centers on the framework surfaces. The synthesis involves mixing a surfactant with an acid equivalent to the hydroxide content of the sodium silicate solution, followed by adding this mixture to the sodium silicate solution. The resulting structures are structurally stable even at high calcination temperatures. After calcination, the pore intensities significantly increase, indicating the removal of the surfactant. This method suggests the potential substitution of soluble silicate precursors for the assembly of other silica mesostructures traditionally made from silicon alkoxide precursors.

文档讨论了从可溶性硅酸盐前体合成具有蠕虫孔框架结构的介孔二氧化硅分子筛。这些材料通常比其有序六角形同系物更具有活性催化剂。增强的反应性归因于它们的三维孔网络，这使得客体分子更容易访问设计在框架表面上的活性中心。这种反应性是由其三维孔网络提高的，该网络允许客体分子更方便地接触框架表面上设计的活性中心。合成过程包括将表面活性剂与等同于硅酸钠溶液中氢氧化物含量的酸混合，在室温下进行，然后将此混合物添加到硅酸钠溶液中以形成反应性硅酸盐。经过烧结后，结构稳定性甚至在高温下也得到保持。烧结后，孔强度显著增加，表明表面活性剂已被去除。这种方法表明，有可能用可溶性硅酸盐前体替换先前仅从硅醇盐前体合成的其他二氧化硅微结构的组装。

The document discusses the preparation of mesoporous silica molecular sieves with wormhole framework structures from soluble silicate precursors, focusing on their potential use as more active heterogeneous catalysts compared to their hexagonal analogs. These wormhole structures allow for better connectivity in three dimensions, enhancing the accessibility of reactive centers and improving catalyst reactivity. The synthesis involves mixing a surfactant and an acid equivalent to the hydroxide content of the sodium silicate solution, followed by adding the solution to the sodium silicate to form reactive silica in the presence of the surfactant. After calcination, the pore structure is retained upon surfactant removal, indicating the stability of the wormhole framework. The successful assembly of these wormhole silica molecular sieves suggests they could replace traditional silicon alkoxide-based methods for preparing other silica mesostructures, offering a more cost-effective alternative.

Mesoporous molecular sieve silicas with wormhole framework structures, such as MSU-X, HMS3, etc., are typically more active as heterogeneous catalysts compared to their hexagonal counterparts like MCM-41, SBA-35, and SBA-156. This enhanced reactivity is partly due to their three-dimensional interconnected pore network, facilitating easier access to reactive sites on the framework surfaces. The wormhole framework structures have traditionally been created through specific assembly pathways involving silica precursors and surfactants. However, these methods often involve costly silicon alkoxides. The current study demonstrates that stable wormhole structures can be synthesized from less expensive silicate precursors, using non-ionic surfactants as structure directors. A typical synthesis involves mixing the surfactant with an acid equivalent to the hydroxide content of the sodium silicate solution, followed by adding this mixture to the sodium silicate solution. The retention of mesostructures is observed up to 480°C, but complete surfactant removal at 600°C can lead to framework restructuring or total amorphization. Powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy confirm the wormhole structure of the synthesized silicas. The successful assembly method suggests potential for substituting silicate precursors in the creation of other silica mesostructures previously made solely from silicon alkoxides.

具有隧道结构的介孔分子筛硅酸盐，如MSU-X、HMS3等，在作为非均相催化剂时通常比其六角晶格同系物（如MCM-41、SBA-35和SBA-156）更活跃。这种增强的反应性部分归因于它们三维互连的孔网络，这使得客体分子更容易访问框架表面上设计的活性中心。到目前为止报告的所有隧道结构都是通过超分子SoIo3和NoIo1、2组装途径制备的，其中Io是电中性的硅酸盐前体（通常是四乙氧基硅烷），So是一种中性的胺表面活性剂，No是一种包含聚乙烯氧化物（PEO）段的中性二或三块表面活性剂。这些途径的一个缺点是基于TEOS的其他组装途径的成本高昂。稳定的介孔分子筛硅酸盐具有隧道结构，以前只能从硅醇盐获得，现在已经能够使用低成本可溶性硅酸盐前体在非离子表面活性剂的存在下制备，作为结构导向剂。典型合成方法包括将表面活性剂与钠硅酸盐溶液中氢氧化物含量相当的酸混合，在室温下混合，然后将此混合物添加到钠硅酸盐溶液中，在表面活性剂的存在下形成反应性硅酸盐。保留微结构直到480°C，但完全去除表面活性剂至600°C会导致框架重排或完全无定形材料的形成。粉末X射线衍射图和透射电子显微镜显示了合成硅酸盐的隧道结构证据。成功的组装方法表明有可能用可溶性硅酸盐前体替换先前仅用于硅醇盐的其他硅酸盐微结构的组装。
