[1] "Mesoporous molecular sieve silicas with wormhole framework structures (e.g. MSU-X,1,2 and HMS3) are generally more active heterogeneous catalysts in comparison to their ordered hexagonal analogs (e.g. MCM-41,4 SBA-35 and SBA-156)."
[2] "The enhanced reactivity has been attributed, in part, to a pore network that is connected in three dimensions, allowing the guest molecules to more readily access reactive centers that have been designed into the framework surfaces."
[3] "One disadvantage of these pathways, as with other assembly pathways based on TEOS, is the high cost of the hydrolyzable silicon alkoxide precursor."
[4] "The present work demonstrates that mesoporous molecular sieve silicas equivalent in structure and thermal stability to MSU-X silicas (denoted MSU-XA) can in fact be prepared from soluble silicate precursors under the appropriate assembly conditions."
[5] "In a typical synthesis the surfactant and an amount of acid equivalent to the hydroxide content of the sodium silicate solution (e.g. 27% SiO2, 14% NaOH, Aldrich) are first mixed at ambient temperature and then added to the sodium silicate solution to form reactive silica in the presence of the surfactant."
[6] "Fig. 1 illustrates the powder X-ray diffraction patterns of as-synthesized and calcined MSU-XA silicas prepared at three different temperatures using Brij 56 [C16H33(EO)10H] as the structure-directing surfactant."
[7] "Further evidence for the wormhole framework pore structure of MSU-XA silicas is provided by the typical transmission electron micrograph (TEM) image shown in Fig. 2."
[8] "The successful assembly of thermally stable mesoporous silica molecular sieve silicas with wormhole frameworks from soluble silicate precursors suggests that it may be possible to substitute soluble silicate precursors for the assembly of many other silica mesostructures that heretofore have been assembled exclusively from silicon alkoxide precursors."

The literature does not provide specific data on how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP or detail the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. It focuses on the preparation and characterization of mesoporous silica molecular sieves with wormhole frameworks from soluble silicate precursors using non-ionic surfactants. The text emphasizes the enhanced reactivity of these materials compared to ordered hexagonal analogs, attributing it partly to their three-dimensional interconnected pore networks. However, it does not delve into the specifics requested regarding metal oxide catalysts or chromium species evolution.

文献没有提供各种金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP反应中活性和选择性的具体比较数据，也没有详细描述在负载和支持性质变化下Cr2O3支持型铬催化剂中铬物种的演变情况。它主要关注从可溶性硅酸盐前体制备具有管状结构的介孔二氧化硅分子筛，并使用非离子表面活性剂作为结构导向剂。文本强调了这些材料与有序六边形类似物相比的增强反应性，部分归因于它们三维互联的孔网络。然而，它没有深入探讨所请求的有关金属氧化物催化剂或铬物种演变的具体信息。
