[1] "Mesoporous molecular sieve silicas with wormhole framework structures (e.g. MSU-X,1,2 and HMS3) are generally more active heterogeneous catalysts in comparison to their ordered hexagonal analogs (e.g. MCM-41,4 SBA-35 and SBA-156)."
[2] "The enhanced reactivity has been attributed, in part, to a pore network that is connected in three dimensions, allowing the guest molecules to more readily access reactive centers that have been designed into the framework surfaces."
[3] "In a typical synthesis the surfactant and an amount of acid equivalent to the hydroxide content of the sodium silicate solution (e.g. 27% SiO2, 14% NaOH, Aldrich) are first mixed at ambient temperature and then added to the sodium silicate solution to form reactive silica in the presence of the surfactant."
[4] "This result is consistent with the retention of the framework pore structure upon complete removal of the surfactant from the framework."
[5] "The successful assembly of thermally stable mesoporous silica molecular sieve silicas with wormhole frameworks from soluble silicate precursors suggests that it may be possible to substitute soluble silicate precursors for the assembly of many other silica mesostructures that heretofore have been assembled exclusively from silicon alkoxide precursors."

The document discusses the preparation of mesoporous silica molecular sieves with wormhole framework structures from soluble silicate precursors, focusing on their potential use as more active heterogeneous catalysts compared to their hexagonal analogs. These wormhole structures allow for better connectivity in three dimensions, enhancing the accessibility of reactive centers and improving catalyst reactivity. The synthesis involves mixing a surfactant and an acid equivalent to the hydroxide content of the sodium silicate solution, followed by adding the solution to the sodium silicate to form reactive silica in the presence of the surfactant. After calcination, the pore structure is retained upon surfactant removal, indicating the stability of the wormhole framework. The successful assembly of these wormhole silica molecular sieves suggests they could replace traditional silicon alkoxide-based methods for preparing other silica mesostructures, offering a more cost-effective alternative.

文档讨论了从可溶性硅酸盐前体制备具有蠕虫孔框架结构的介孔二氧化硅分子筛，重点关注它们作为与六角型类似物相比更有效的异质催化剂的可能性。这些蠕虫孔结构在三维中具有更好的连接性，提高了活性中心的可达性，从而提高催化剂的反应性。合成过程涉及将表面活性剂和与硅酸钠溶液中的氢氧化物含量等效的酸混合，在室温下，然后将该溶液添加到硅酸钠溶液中，在表面活性剂的存在下形成活性二氧化硅。在煅烧后，表面活性剂去除后仍能保留框架孔结构，表明蠕虫孔框架的稳定性。成功组装这些蠕虫孔二氧化硅分子筛表明，它们可以替代传统硅醇基方法准备其他二氧化硅微结构，提供一种更经济的替代方案。
