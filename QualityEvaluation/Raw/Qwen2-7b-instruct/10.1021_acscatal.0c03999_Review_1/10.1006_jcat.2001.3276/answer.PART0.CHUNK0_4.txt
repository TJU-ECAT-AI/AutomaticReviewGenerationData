[1] "Vanadium species introduced by the template-ion exchange method were mainly dispersed on the wall of MCM-41 in the state of monomeric tetrahedral coordination, while the direct hydrothermal method led to vanadium sites mainly incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41."
[2] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vanadium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, respectively) were almost held simultaneously."
[3] "TIE catalysts, however, were not selective for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8."
[4] "The conversion of C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10 also increased with introduction of vanadium to MCM-41 by the DHT method, but the decrease in conversion was observed as the vanadium content became high."
[5] "The DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4."
[6] "However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C, respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt%."
[7] "Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content in the same reactions."
[8] "The highest yield of acrolein obtained was 3% with selectivity approaching 20%."
[9] "At low O2 pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the sum of the selectivities to C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95 and 87% with C3H8 conversions of 3.0 and 4.4%, respectively."
