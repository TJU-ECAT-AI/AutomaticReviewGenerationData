[1] "The vanadium species introduced by the template-ion-exchange method were mainly dispersed on the wall of MCM-41 in the state of monomeric tetrahedral coordination, while the direct hydrothermal method led to vanadium sites mainly incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41."
[2] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vanadium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, respectively) were almost held simultaneously."
[3] "However, TIE catalysts, however, were not selective for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8."
[4] "The conversion of C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10 also increased with introduction of vanadium to MCM-41 by the DHT method, but the decrease in conversion was observed as the vanadium content became high."
[5] "The DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4."
[6] "However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C, respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt%."
[7] "Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content in the same reactions."
[8] "The highest yield of acrolein obtained was 3% with selectivity approaching 20%."
[9] "At low O2 pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the sum of the selectivities to C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95 and 87% with C3H8 conversions of 3.0 and 4.4%, respectively."
[10] "Acrolein is probably formed by the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the acid sites with medium strength in the catalyst are suggested to play roles in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate and thus contribute to the formation of acrolein."

1. The vanadium species in TIE samples were dispersed on the wall of MCM-41, whereas in DHT samples, vanadium sites were incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41.
2. In TIE catalysts, the conversion of alkane increased significantly with vanadium content, showing moderate selectivities for C2H4 and C3H6 (around 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C, respectively).
3. TIE catalysts did not exhibit selectivity for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8.
4. The DHT method led to vanadium sites mainly inside the MCM-41 framework, causing a decrease in conversion at high vanadium content.
5. DHT catalysts had poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4.
6. High selectivities for C3H6 and i-C4H8 (around 60% and 50% at 550°C with over 15% conversion) were obtained over DHT catalysts with vanadium content above 1.0 wt%.
7. DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content produced acrolein and methacrolein besides C3H6 and i-C4H8.
8. The maximum acrolein yield was 3% with a selectivity close to 20%.
9. At low O2 pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the sum of selectivities for C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95 and 87% with C3H8 conversions of 3.0 and 4.4%, respectively.
10. Acrolein formation was likely due to allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and medium-strength acid sites in the catalyst were involved in adsorbing these intermediates to form acrolein.

1. 在模板离子交换方法中引入的钒物种主要分布在MCM-41的壁上，在四面体单体协调状态下分散。而在直接水热法中，钒位点主要被整合到MCM-41的框架内部。
2. 对于TIE催化剂，随着钒含量的增加，烷烃转化显著提高，并且在550°C和500°C时，显示了对C2H4和C3H6（分别为约50%和40%）的适度选择性。
3. TIE催化剂没有显示出对i-C4H10氧化为i-C4H8的选择性。
4. 使用DHT方法导致MCM-41框架内部的钒位点，当钒含量较高时，观察到转化率下降。
5. DHT催化剂在氧化C2H6至C2H4方面的选择性较差。
6. 当DHT催化剂中的钒含量超过1.0 wt%时，在C3H8氧化和i-C4H10氧化过程中，获得了高选择性，分别达到60%和50%的C3H6和i-C4H8（在550°C时转化率超过15%）。
7. DHT催化剂在较低的钒含量下产生了除了C3H6和i-C4H8之外的丙烯醛和甲基丙烯醛。
8. 最大的丙烯醛产量为3%，选择性接近20%。
9. 在低氧气压（1.0和2.0 kPa）下，C3H6和丙烯醛的选择性之和可以达到95和87%，对应C3H8转化率为3.0和4.4%。
10. 丙烯醛的形成可能是通过C3H6或亚甲基中间体的亚甲基氧化，催化剂中的中等强度酸位被认为参与吸附这些中间体以形成丙烯醛。
