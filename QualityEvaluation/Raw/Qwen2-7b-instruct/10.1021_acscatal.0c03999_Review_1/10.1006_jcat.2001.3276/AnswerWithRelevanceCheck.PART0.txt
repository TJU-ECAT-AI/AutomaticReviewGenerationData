          [1] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vanadium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, respectively) were almost held simultaneously."
          [2] "However, the DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4."
          [3] "However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C, respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt%."
          [4] "The highest yield of acrolein obtained was 3% with selectivity approaching 20%."
          [5] "At low O2 pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the sum of the selectivities to C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95 and 87% with C3H8 conversions of 3.0 and 4.4%, respectively."

          The TIE catalysts demonstrated enhanced alkane conversion with increased vanadium content, showing moderate selectivities for C2H4 and C3H6 in the oxidation of C2H6 and C3H8, respectively, with selectivities of about 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C. In contrast, the DHT catalysts exhibited poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (around 60% and 50% with conversion greater than 15% at 550°C, respectively) were achieved in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over DHT catalysts with vanadium content surpassing 1.0 wt%. Additionally, the highest yield of acrolein was 3%, with a selectivity approaching 20%. At low oxygen partial pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the combined selectivities for C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95% and 87%, respectively, with C3H8 conversions of 3.0% and 4.4%, respectively.

          在TIE催化剂中，随着钒含量的增加，烷烃的转化率显著提高，并且在C2H6和C3H8的氧化中，分别对C2H4和C3H6显示出了约50%（在550°C）和40%（在500°C）的适度选择性。相反，DHT催化剂在C2H6氧化为C2H4时选择性较差。然而，在DHT催化剂中，当钒含量超过1.0 wt%时，在C3H8和i-C4H10的氧化中，获得了高选择性至C3H6（约60%）和i-C4H8（约50%，转化率大于15%时，550°C）。此外，最高获得的丙烯醛产率为3%，选择性接近20%。在低氧分压（1.0和2.0 kPa）下，C3H6和丙烯醛的选择性之和可分别达到95%和87%，对应的C3H8转化率分别为3.0%和4.4%。

          [1] "The vanadium species introduced by the template-ion exchange method were mainly dispersed on the wall of MCM-41 in the state of monomeric tetrahedral coordination, while the direct hydrothermal method led to vanadium sites mainly incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41."
          [2] "The vanadium species in the TIE method were mainly dispersed on the wall of MCM-41, whereas those in the DHT method were incorporated into the framework of MCM-41."
          [3] "The conversion of C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10 also increased with introduction of vanadium to MCM-41 by the DHT method, but the decrease in conversion was observed as the vanadium content became high."
          [4] "The DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4."
          [5] "Acrolein is probably formed by the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the acid sites with medium strength in the catalyst are suggested to play roles in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate and thus contribute to the formation of acrolein."

          Vanadium species introduced via the template-ion exchange method were predominantly found on the wall of MCM-41 in a monomeric tetrahedral coordination, whereas those from the direct hydrothermal method were incorporated into the framework of MCM-41. In the TIE method, vanadium species were mainly distributed on the wall of MCM-41. When vanadium was introduced to MCM-41 through the DHT method, there was an increase in alkane conversion, but this decrease was noted as the vanadium content grew high. The DHT catalysts displayed low selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. Moreover, it is hypothesized that acrolein is formed via the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the medium-strength acid sites in the catalyst are believed to participate in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, thus facilitating the formation of acrolein.

          使用模板离子交换方法引入的钒物种主要分布在MCM-41的壁上，在四面体单体协调状态下，而直接水热法导致的钒位点则主要被整合到MCM-41的框架内。在TIE方法中，钒物种主要分布在MCM-41的壁上。通过DHT方法向MCM-41引入的钒，烷烃转化率有所增加，但随着钒含量的增加，转化率出现下降。DHT催化剂在C2H6氧化为C2H4方面选择性较差。此外，推测丙烯醛可能是通过C3H6或亚甲基中间体的亚甲基氧化形成的，催化剂中的中等强度酸位被认为参与了C3H6或亚甲基中间体的吸附，从而促进了丙烯醛的形成。
