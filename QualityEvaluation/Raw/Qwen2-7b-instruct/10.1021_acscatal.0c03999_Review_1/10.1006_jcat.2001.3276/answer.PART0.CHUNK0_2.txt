[1] "The vanadium species introduced by the template-ion exchange method were mainly dispersed on the wall of MCM-41 in the state of monomeric tetrahedral coordination, while the direct hydrothermal method led to vanadium sites mainly incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41."
[2] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vanadium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, respectively) were almost held simultaneously."
[3] "TIE catalysts, however, were not selective for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8."
[4] "The conversion of C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10 also increased with introduction of vanadium to MCM-41 by the DHT method, but the decrease in conversion was observed as the vanadium content became high."
[5] "The DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C, respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt%."
[6] "Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content in the same reactions."

1. The vanadium species introduced via template-ion exchange method were primarily located on the surface of MCM-41 in a monomeric tetrahedral configuration, whereas the direct hydrothermal method resulted in vanadium sites being mostly integrated into the MCM-41 framework.
2. With increasing vanadium content, the conversion of alkanes notably increased in TIE catalysts, achieving moderate selectivities towards C2H4 (50%) and C3H6 (40%) in the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, respectively, at 550°C and 500°C.
3. TIE catalysts did not demonstrate selectivity for the i-C4H10 oxidation to i-C4H8.
4. Incorporating vanadium through the direct hydrothermal method led to an increase in the conversion of C2H6, C3H8, or i-C4H10, yet a decline in conversion was observed with higher vanadium content.
5. DHT catalysts exhibited poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. Nevertheless, high selectivities for C3H6 (60%) and i-C4H8 (50%) were achieved in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10, respectively, at 550°C, when the vanadium content surpassed 1.0 wt%.
6. In addition to C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were synthesized with notable selectivity over DHT catalysts with lesser vanadium content in the same reactions.

1. 使用模板离子交换方法引入的钒物种主要分布在MCM-41的壁面上，在四面体单体协调状态下，而直接水热法导致的钒位点则主要被整合到MCM-41的框架内。
2. 随着钒含量的增加，TIE催化剂中的烷烃转化率显著提高，在C2H6和C3H8的氧化中分别达到了550°C和500°C时，C2H4（50%）和C3H6（40%）的适度选择性。
3. TIE催化剂并未表现出对i-C4H10氧化为i-C4H8的选择性。
4. 通过直接水热法引入的钒导致了C2H6、C3H8或i-C4H10的转化率增加，但随着钒含量的提高，转化率出现了下降。
5. DHT催化剂在C2H6氧化为C2H4的选择性较差。然而，在C3H8和i-C4H10的氧化中，当钒含量超过1.0 wt%时，获得了高选择性C3H6（60%）和i-C4H8（50%）。
6. 在相同的反应中，除了C3H6和i-C4H8，较低钒含量的DHT催化剂还实现了acrolein和methacrolein的合成，具有较高的选择性。
