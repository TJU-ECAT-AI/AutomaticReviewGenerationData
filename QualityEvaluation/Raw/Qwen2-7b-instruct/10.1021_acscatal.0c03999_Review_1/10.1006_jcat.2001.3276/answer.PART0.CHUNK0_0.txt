[1] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vanadium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, respectively) were almost held simultaneously."
[2] "However, the DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C, respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt%."
[3] "Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content in the same reactions. The highest yield of acrolein obtained was 3% with selectivity approaching 20%."

1. The TIE catalysts showed high activity and moderate selectivity for the conversion of alkanes like C2H6 and C3H8 to their respective alkenes (C2H4 and C3H6) with selectivities around 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C, respectively. However, they were not selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8. 
2. In contrast, the DHT catalysts exhibited poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, but they showed high selectivity for the production of C3H6 and i-C4H8 in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10, respectively. The selectivities were approximately 60% and 50% with conversion greater than 15% at 550°C, respectively.
3. The DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content also produced acrolein and methacrolein with significant selectivity. The highest yield of acrolein achieved was 3% with a selectivity nearing 20%.

1. TIE催化剂在C2H6和C3H8的氧化反应中，烷烃转化率显著提高，同时保持了对C2H4和C3H6（分别在550°C和500°C时为50%和40%）的中等选择性。然而，它们对于i-C4H10的氧化脱氢反应的选择性较低。
2. 相比之下，DHT催化剂在C2H6氧化反应中的选择性较低，但对于C3H8和i-C4H10的氧化生成C3H6和i-C4H8显示出了高选择性。选择性分别为约60%和50%，转化率大于15%时，在550°C下分别实现。
3.DHT催化剂在较低的钒含量下也生产出丙烯醛和甲基丙烯醛，显示出显著的选择性。最高获得的丙烯醛产率为3%，选择性接近20%。
