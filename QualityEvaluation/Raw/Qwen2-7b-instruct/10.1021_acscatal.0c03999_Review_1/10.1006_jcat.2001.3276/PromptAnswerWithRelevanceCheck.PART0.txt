<quotes>
[1] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vanadium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, respectively) were almost held simultaneously."
[2] "However, the DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C, respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt%."
[3] "Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content in the same reactions. The highest yield of acrolein obtained was 3% with selectivity approaching 20%."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The TIE catalysts showed high activity and moderate selectivity for the conversion of alkanes like C2H6 and C3H8 to their respective alkenes (C2H4 and C3H6) with selectivities around 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C, respectively. However, they were not selective for the oxidative dehydrogenation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8. 
2. In contrast, the DHT catalysts exhibited poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4, but they showed high selectivity for the production of C3H6 and i-C4H8 in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10, respectively. The selectivities were approximately 60% and 50% with conversion greater than 15% at 550°C, respectively.
3. The DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content also produced acrolein and methacrolein with significant selectivity. The highest yield of acrolein achieved was 3% with a selectivity nearing 20%.

3. TIE catalysts did not demonstrate selectivity for the i-C4H10 oxidation to i-C4H8.

1. Over the TIE catalysts, the conversion of alkane increased notably with increased vanadium content, while moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (approximately 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C, respectively) were maintained simultaneously. These catalysts did not show selectivity for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8.
2. The DHT catalysts demonstrated low selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, they provided high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (approximately 60% and 50% with conversion greater than 15% at 550°C, respectively) in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10, respectively. These results were achieved with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt% in the DHT catalysts.
3. With lower vanadium content, the DHT catalysts were capable of producing acrolein and methacrolein besides C3H6 and i-C4H8 in the same reactions.
4. At low oxygen pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the combined selectivity towards C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95% and 87%, respectively, with conversions of C3H8 at 3.0% and 4.4%, respectively.
5. Acrolein is believed to be formed through the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the medium-strength acid sites within the catalyst are thought to facilitate the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, thereby contributing to the formation of acrolein.
