[1] "During the oxidations of C2H6 and C3H8, the conversion of alkane increased remarkably with increasing vana- dium content over TIE catalysts and moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (ca. 50 and 40% at 550 and 500C, re- spectively) were almost held simultaneously."
[2] "TIE catalysts,however, were not selective for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8."
[3] "The DHT catalysts showed poor selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (ca. 60 and 50% with conversion >15% at 550C,respectively) were obtained in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10 over the DHT catalysts with vanadium content ex- ceeding 1.0 wt%."
[4] "Besides C3H6 and i-C4H8, acrolein and methacrolein were also achieved over the DHT catalysts with lower vanadium content in the same reactions."
[5] "At low O2 pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa),the sum of the selectivities to C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95 and 87% with C3H8 conversions of 3.0 and 4.4%, re- spectively."
[6] "Acrolein is probably formed by the allylic ox- idation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the acid sites with medium strength in the catalyst are suggested to play roles in the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate and thus contribute to the formation of acrolein."

1. Over the TIE catalysts, the conversion of alkane increased notably with increased vanadium content, while moderate selectivities to C2H4 and C3H6 (approximately 50% and 40% at 550 and 500°C, respectively) were maintained simultaneously. These catalysts did not show selectivity for the oxidation of i-C4H10 to i-C4H8.
2. The DHT catalysts demonstrated low selectivity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. However, they provided high selectivities to C3H6 and i-C4H8 (approximately 60% and 50% with conversion greater than 15% at 550°C, respectively) in the oxidations of C3H8 and i-C4H10, respectively. These results were achieved with vanadium content exceeding 1.0 wt% in the DHT catalysts.
3. With lower vanadium content, the DHT catalysts were capable of producing acrolein and methacrolein besides C3H6 and i-C4H8 in the same reactions.
4. At low oxygen pressures (1.0 and 2.0 kPa), the combined selectivity towards C3H6 and acrolein could reach 95% and 87%, respectively, with conversions of C3H8 at 3.0% and 4.4%, respectively.
5. Acrolein is believed to be formed through the allylic oxidation of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, and the medium-strength acid sites within the catalyst are thought to facilitate the adsorption of C3H6 or allylic intermediate, thereby contributing to the formation of acrolein.

1. 在TIE催化剂中，随着钒含量的增加，烷烃的转化率显著提高，同时获得了约50%（在550°C）和40%（在500°C）的C2H4和C3H6的适度选择性。这些催化剂没有显示出将i-C4H10氧化为i-C4H8的选择性。
2. DHT催化剂对C2H6的氧化脱氢表现出低选择性，然而，在DHT催化剂中，当钒含量超过1.0 wt%时，它们在C3H8和i-C4H10的氧化中提供了高选择性至C3H6（约60%）和i-C4H8（约50%，转化率大于15%时，550°C），分别。在相同反应条件下，这些结果是在DHT催化剂中获得的。
3. 当钒含量较低时，DHT催化剂能够产生除C3H6和i-C4H8之外的丙烯醛和甲基丙烯醛等化合物，在相同的反应中。
4. 在低氧压（1.0和2.0 kPa）下，C3H6和丙烯醛的组合选择性可达到95%和87%，分别对应于C3H8的转化率分别为3.0%和4.4%。
5. 丙烯醛被认为是通过C3H6或亚甲基中间体的亚甲基氧化形成的，催化剂中的中等强度酸位被认为有助于C3H6或亚甲基中间体的吸附，从而促进丙烯醛的形成。
