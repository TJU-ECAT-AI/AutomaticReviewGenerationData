Answer: The document does not provide a direct comparison of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP activity and selectivity. However, it does focus on chromium oxide catalysts supported on mesoporous silica, suggesting that factors such as the loading of chromium and the properties of the support might influence their catalytic performance.

Answer: The study emphasizes the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties, indicating that these factors could significantly affect the catalytic performance for CO2-ODHP.
