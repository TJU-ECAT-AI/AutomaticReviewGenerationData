[1] "An iron-containing mesoporous molecular sieve (FeMCM-41) synthesized by both direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods has been characterized and used as a catalyst for the liquid-phase epoxidation of styrene with diluted H2O2."
[2] "The characterizations with XRD, diffuse reflectance UVvis, ESR, and EXAFS suggest that iron cations are highly dispersed and tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen in the DHT samples with iron content lower than ca. 0.91.1 wt% (Si/Fe = 10586)."
[3] "The TIE samples mainly contain small iron oxide clusters."
[4] "The conversion of styrene over the DHT catalyst increases significantly with increasing iron content up to 1.1 wt%."
[5] "As compared with the DHT catalyst, the TIE catalyst shows a much poorer performance for the epoxidation of styrene."
[6] "It is suggested that the atomically isolated iron sites account for the epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide."
[7] "The iron cations incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 do not leach during the reaction, whereas the small iron oxide clusters leach out into the liquid phase and do not contribute to the catalytic reaction."

1. Iron-containing mesoporous molecular sieves (FeMCM-41) were synthesized using both direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods. These catalysts were utilized for the liquid-phase epoxidation of styrene with diluted hydrogen peroxide.
2. In the DHT samples, iron cations were found to be highly dispersed and tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen. This coordination environment is similar to that in a ferrisilicate zeolite with MFI structure.
3. The TIE samples primarily consisted of small iron oxide clusters.
4. The conversion of styrene over the DHT catalyst significantly increased with an increase in iron content up to 1.1 wt%.
5. Compared to the DHT catalyst, the TIE catalyst demonstrated much poorer performance for the epoxidation of styrene.
6. The atomically isolated iron sites were proposed to be responsible for the epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide.
7. The iron cations incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 did not leach during the reaction, whereas the small iron oxide clusters leached out into the liquid phase and did not contribute to the catalytic reaction.

1. 铁基介孔分子筛（FeMCM-41）通过直接水热法和模板离子交换法合成，用于液体相环氧乙烷化苯乙烯与稀氢过氧化物。
2. 在DHT样品中，铁离子高度分散且与氧四面体配位。这种配位环境类似于具有MFI结构的磁性硅酸盐。
3. TIE样品主要由小铁氧化物簇组成。
4. 随着铁含量增加至1.1 wt%，DHT催化剂对苯乙烯的转化率显著提高。
5. 相比之下，TIE催化剂在苯乙烯环氧乙烷化中的性能要差得多。
6. 原子级隔离的铁位点被认为是氢过氧化物环氧反应的原因。
7. MCM-41框架内的铁离子在反应过程中没有流失，而小铁氧化物簇则流出液相，不参与催化反应。
