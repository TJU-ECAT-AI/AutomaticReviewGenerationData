1. The consumption of H2O2 was determined by iodometric titration.
2. With an increase in Fe content exceeding 0.9 wt%, the calcined DHT sample turned off-white, suggesting the presence of extraframework iron.
3. Bands at 385 and 510 nm appeared in the UVvis spectra of the TIE samples, becoming stronger with increased Fe content.
4. The relative intensity of the g = 4.3 signal was lower for the TIE samples compared to ferrisilicate and DHT samples.
5. A characteristic feature of the XANES spectra is the preedge peak at approximately 7112 eV, attributed to the 1s3d dipolar forbidden transition.

1. H2O2的消耗通过碘量法确定。
2. 随着铁含量超过0.9 wt%，热处理后的DHT样品变为微白色，可能表明存在额外框架铁。
3. TIE样品的UVvis光谱中出现了385和510 nm波长的带，且随着铁含量增加而变得更强烈。
4. TIE样品中的g = 4.3信号相对强度低于沸石硅酸盐和DHT样品。
5. XANES光谱的特征是大约在7112 eV处的预边峰，归因于所谓的1s3d偶极禁止跃迁。
