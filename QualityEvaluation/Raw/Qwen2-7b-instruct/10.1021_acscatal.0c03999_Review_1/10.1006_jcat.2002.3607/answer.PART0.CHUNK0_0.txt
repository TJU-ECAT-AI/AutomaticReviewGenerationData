[1] "However, to our knowledge, no iron-containing heterogeneous catalyst has been reported to show significant activity for the epoxidation of alkenes with H2O2, although substituted iron(III) porphyrin chlorides, typical biomimetic model complexes, are effective for epoxidation reactions with organic hydroperoxide."
[2] "The leaching of active components is a common problem in liquid-phase oxidation reactions. For example, the leach- ing of V and Cr was observed from V and CrMCM-41,respectively, during oxidation with H2O2 (25)."
[3] "It can be expected that the metal cations with different environments in mesoporous material would result in different catalytic properties and leaching behavior."
[4] "Recently,we communicated that FeMCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis exhibited good performance for the epoxidation of styrene with H2O2 (27)."
[5] "In the present paper, we introduce iron into MCM-41 using two different methods, i.e., direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods."
[6] "FeMCM-41-DHT was prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis."
[7] "FeMCM-41-TIE was prepared using the template-ion exchange method."
[8] "Ferrisilicate with MFI structure and Fe2O3/CabOSil were also prepared for comparison."
[9] "The synthesized materials are characterized in detail to gain insight into the coordination environments of the introduced iron cations."
[10] "The content of iron in each sample was determined by ICP after the sample was completely dissolved using diluted hydrochloric acid and a small amount of hydrofluoric acid."
[11] "XRD measurements showed that the diffraction lines of (100), (110), (200), and (210) at 2θ degrees of ca. 2.2, 3.6, 4.3, and 5.7 indexed to the hexagonal regularity of MCM-41 were observed for all the FeMCM-41 samples shown in Table 1, suggesting that the hexagonal array of mesopores in MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of iron with both methods."
[12] "The color of the Fe-containing samples synthesized in this work is also shown in Table 1 since it is a simple indication of whether bulk iron oxide exists (28)."
[13] "All the as-synthesized FeMCM-41-DHT samples exhibited a white color, suggesting that no bulk iron oxide existed and all the iron cations were probably incorporated inside the framework after hydrothermal synthesis."
[14] "Two signals, g = 2.0 and 4.3, were mainly detected for the Fe-containing samples in Table 1."
[15] "It was reported that the signal at g = 4.3 could be attributed to Fe(III) in tetrahedrally coordinated with strong rhombic distortion and that at g = 2.0 was Fe(III) in octahedral coordination."
[16] "The signal at g = 4.3 was observed for the FeMCM-41 prepared by the TIE method, but the relative intensity was much lower compared with that from the ferrisilicate and the FeMCM-41 synthesized by the DHT method."
[17] "The coordination environment of iron has further been investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which has proven to be a powerful tool for characterizing the metal ions in molecular sieves (14)."
[18] "Since the local symmetry around the iron is lowered from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination, the intensity (denoted as I) of this peak tends to decrease."
