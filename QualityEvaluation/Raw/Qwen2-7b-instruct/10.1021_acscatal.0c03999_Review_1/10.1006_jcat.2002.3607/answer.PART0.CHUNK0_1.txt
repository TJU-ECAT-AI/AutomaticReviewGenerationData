Iron-containing catalysts have shown activity in various oxidation reactions including the conversion of benzene to phenol, selective oxidation of benzene to phenol, oxidation of alkanes to oxygenates, and partial oxidation of methane and ethane to alcohols. However, there is no report of iron-containing heterogeneous catalysts demonstrating significant activity for the epoxidation of alkenes using hydrogen peroxide.
