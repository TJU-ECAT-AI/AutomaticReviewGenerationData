[1] "However, to our knowledge, no iron-containing heterogeneous catalyst has been reported to show significant activity for the epoxidation of alkenes with H2O2, although substituted iron(III) porphyrin chlorides, typical biomimetic model complexes, are effective for epoxidation reactions with organic hydroperoxide."
[2] "On the other hand, the TIE samples mainly contain small iron oxide clusters."
[3] "The conversion of styrene over the DHT catalyst increases significantly with increasing iron content up to 1.1 wt%."
[4] "The selectivity to styrene oxide and the efficiency of H2O2 for the epoxidation can be improved by adding H2O2 slowly to keep the H2O2 concentration low during the reaction."
[5] "It is suggested that the atomically isolated iron sites account for the epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide."

The study discusses the use of iron-containing mesoporous molecular sieves (FeMCM-41) as catalysts for the liquid-phase epoxidation of styrene with hydrogen peroxide. The direct hydrothermal (DHT) method was found to produce FeMCM-41 samples with iron content up to 1.1 wt% where iron cations are highly dispersed and tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen. This coordination environment contributes to an increase in the relative strength of acidic sites, which improves the conversion of styrene and the selectivity to styrene oxide. The template-ion exchange (TIE) method resulted in samples with small iron oxide clusters. By adding hydrogen peroxide slowly to maintain a low concentration, the efficiency of the epoxidation process can be enhanced. It is concluded that the atomically isolated iron sites are responsible for the epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The iron cations incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 do not leach during the reaction, whereas the small iron oxide clusters leach out into the liquid phase and do not contribute to the catalytic reaction.

研究讨论了铁基分子筛（FeMCM-41）在氢过氧化物存在下对苯乙烯的液相环氧化应用。直接水热合成（DHT）方法产生了铁含量高达1.1 wt%的FeMCM-41样品，其中铁离子高度分散且与氧四面体配合。这种配合环境有助于增加酸性位点的相对强度，从而提高苯乙烯的转化率和苯乙烯氧化物的选择性。模板离子交换（TIE）方法则产生了含有小铁氧化簇的样品。通过缓慢添加氢过氧化物以保持较低浓度，可以增强环氧化过程的效率。研究表明，原子级别的孤立铁位是氢过氧化物环氧化反应的关键。嵌入框架内的铁离子在反应过程中不会流失，而小铁氧化簇则会流出至液体相中，并不参与催化反应。
