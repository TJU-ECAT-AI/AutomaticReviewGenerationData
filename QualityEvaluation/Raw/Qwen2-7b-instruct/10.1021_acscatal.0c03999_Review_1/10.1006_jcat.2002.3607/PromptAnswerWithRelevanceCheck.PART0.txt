[1] "However, to our knowledge, no iron-containing heterogeneous catalyst has been reported to show significant activity for the epoxidation of alkenes with H2O2, although substituted iron(III) porphyrin chlorides, typical biomimetic model complexes, are effective for epoxidation reactions with organic hydroperoxide."
[2] "The leaching of active components is a common problem in liquid-phase oxidation reactions. For example, the leach- ing of V and Cr was observed from V and CrMCM-41,respectively, during oxidation with H2O2 (25)."
[3] "It can be expected that the metal cations with different environments in mesoporous material would result in different catalytic properties and leaching behavior."
[4] "Recently,we communicated that FeMCM-41 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis exhibited good performance for the epoxidation of styrene with H2O2 (27)."
[5] "In the present paper, we introduce iron into MCM-41 using two different methods, i.e., direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods."
[6] "FeMCM-41-DHT was prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis."
[7] "FeMCM-41-TIE was prepared using the template-ion exchange method."
[8] "Ferrisilicate with MFI structure and Fe2O3/CabOSil were also prepared for comparison."
[9] "The synthesized materials are characterized in detail to gain insight into the coordination environments of the introduced iron cations."
[10] "The content of iron in each sample was determined by ICP after the sample was completely dissolved using diluted hydrochloric acid and a small amount of hydrofluoric acid."
[11] "XRD measurements showed that the diffraction lines of (100), (110), (200), and (210) at 2θ degrees of ca. 2.2, 3.6, 4.3, and 5.7 indexed to the hexagonal regularity of MCM-41 were observed for all the FeMCM-41 samples shown in Table 1, suggesting that the hexagonal array of mesopores in MCM-41 was sustained after the introduction of iron with both methods."
[12] "The color of the Fe-containing samples synthesized in this work is also shown in Table 1 since it is a simple indication of whether bulk iron oxide exists (28)."
[13] "All the as-synthesized FeMCM-41-DHT samples exhibited a white color, suggesting that no bulk iron oxide existed and all the iron cations were probably incorporated inside the framework after hydrothermal synthesis."
[14] "Two signals, g = 2.0 and 4.3, were mainly detected for the Fe-containing samples in Table 1."
[15] "It was reported that the signal at g = 4.3 could be attributed to Fe(III) in tetrahedrally coordinated with strong rhombic distortion and that at g = 2.0 was Fe(III) in octahedral coordination."
[16] "The signal at g = 4.3 was observed for the FeMCM-41 prepared by the TIE method, but the relative intensity was much lower compared with that from the ferrisilicate and the FeMCM-41 synthesized by the DHT method."
[17] "The coordination environment of iron has further been investigated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which has proven to be a powerful tool for characterizing the metal ions in molecular sieves (14)."
[18] "Since the local symmetry around the iron is lowered from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination, the intensity (denoted as I) of this peak tends to decrease."

The study discusses the use of iron-containing mesoporous molecular sieves (FeMCM-41) as catalysts for the liquid-phase epoxidation of styrene with hydrogen peroxide. The direct hydrothermal (DHT) method was found to produce FeMCM-41 samples with iron content up to 1.1 wt% where iron cations are highly dispersed and tetrahedrally coordinated with oxygen. This coordination environment contributes to an increase in the relative strength of acidic sites, which improves the conversion of styrene and the selectivity to styrene oxide. The template-ion exchange (TIE) method resulted in samples with small iron oxide clusters. By adding hydrogen peroxide slowly to maintain a low concentration, the efficiency of the epoxidation process can be enhanced. It is concluded that the atomically isolated iron sites are responsible for the epoxidation reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The iron cations incorporated inside the framework of MCM-41 do not leach during the reaction, whereas the small iron oxide clusters leach out into the liquid phase and do not contribute to the catalytic reaction.

研究讨论了铁基分子筛（FeMCM-41）在氢过氧化物存在下对苯乙烯的液相环氧化应用。直接水热合成（DHT）方法产生了铁含量高达1.1 wt%的FeMCM-41样品，其中铁离子高度分散且与氧四面体配合。这种配合环境有助于增加酸性位点的相对强度，从而提高苯乙烯的转化率和苯乙烯氧化物的选择性。模板离子交换（TIE）方法则产生了含有小铁氧化簇的样品。通过缓慢添加氢过氧化物以保持较低浓度，可以增强环氧化过程的效率。研究表明，原子级别的孤立铁位是氢过氧化物环氧化反应的关键。嵌入框架内的铁离子在反应过程中不会流失，而小铁氧化簇则会流出至液体相中，并不参与催化反应。
