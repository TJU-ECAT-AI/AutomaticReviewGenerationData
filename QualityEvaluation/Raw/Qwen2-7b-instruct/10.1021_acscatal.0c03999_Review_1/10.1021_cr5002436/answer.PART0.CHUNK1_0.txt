[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "Indeed, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[3] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Brnsted acid and others active sites of the catalysts serve as seeding points to which olefins and paraffins are added until large graphitic structures are formed."
[4] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[5] "However, because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results."

1. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences the type of vanadium species that form on the catalyst. Monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric species are present between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominate at higher loadings.
2. Metal oxide-based catalysts often deactivate quickly, primarily due to coke deposition and the inability to fully recover their activity through regeneration.
3. Coke formation is a complex process not well understood. Active sites like Brnsted acid serve as starting points for olefins and paraffins to accumulate and form large graphitic structures.
4. Coke species can expand from aromatic rings through DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or by fusing smaller domains into larger ones.
5. Isotopic scrambling in equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation reactions complicates the interpretation of experimental results due to compounds reacting back and forth.

1. 表面积与金属负载比决定形成哪种物种。的确，吴等人报告指出，在1.2 V/nm2以下主要是单体物种，1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间是聚合态钒物种占主导，更高负载时则是V2O5结晶物种占优势。
2. 金属氧化物基催化剂通常会快速失活，主要原因是焦炭沉积和无法完全通过再生过程恢复其活性。
3. 焦炭形成是一个复杂的过程，理解程度不高。活性位点如Brnsted酸作为烯烃和烷烃积聚并形成大型石墨状结构的起点。
4. 焦炭物种可以从芳香环扩展，通过DielsAlder型添加、丙烯添加到自由基或通过将较小的领域融合成更大的领域。
5. 平衡控制的脱氢反应中的同位素混乱由于化合物的前后反应而使实验结果难以解释。
