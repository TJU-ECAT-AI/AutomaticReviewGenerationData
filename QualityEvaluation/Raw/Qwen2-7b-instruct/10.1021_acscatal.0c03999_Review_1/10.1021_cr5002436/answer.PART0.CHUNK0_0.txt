[1] "Indeed, the profitability of propane dehydrogenation is determined to a large extent by the price difference between propane and propylene, which makes the current market conditions very favorable."
[2] "As shown in Table 1, in addition to methane, shale gas deposits contain considerable amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), such as ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas."
[3] "In fact, the high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[4] "However, this number is expected to increase significantly in the upcoming years as dozens of new PDH installations have been announced worldwide, and many of these installations are already under construction."
[5] "Moreover, the products made by these olefins are shown in the graph to the right."
[6] "A number of factors including the high-energy demands of these processes, their low selectivity toward the production of particular olefins, dwindling petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are driving the petrochemical industry to search for a more economical feedstock and more efficient conversion technologies."
[7] "Consequently, the recent boom in shale gas production has turned the United States into the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, as illustrated by the 126 investment projects totaling 84 billion dollars made up to September 2013 that have been tallied by the American Chemistry Council."
[8] "The high availability of these relatively cheap natural gas liquids, specifically ethane, has resulted in a shift from oil-based naphtha to shale-based ethane for steam cracking installations in the United States, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted."
[9] "The majority of these new facilities will be built in China or the United States and will use either the Catofin (Lummus) or the Oleflex (UOP) technologies."
[10] "A schematic of a Catofin dehydrogenation unit is shown in Figure 3."
[11] "The catalyst remains in use for 23 years, and the progressive loss in activity with increasing time-on-stream is counteracted by gradual increases in temperature to afford a constant dehydrogenation activity throughout the entire catalyst life span."

1. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation largely depends on the price gap between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable.
2. Shale gas deposits contain significant quantities of natural gas liquids (NGL), including ethane and propane, which are easily separated from natural gas.
3. There has been a shift from using naphtha to ethane in steam cracking installations in the US due to the abundance of relatively inexpensive ethane.
4. The number of new propane dehydrogenation (PDH) installations is anticipated to increase significantly in the coming years, with numerous installations already under construction globally.
5. The products made by olefins are depicted in the graph to the right.
6. Various factors such as high energy demands, low selectivity for specific olefins, declining petroleum reserves, and rising oil prices are prompting the petrochemical industry to seek more economical feedstocks and efficient conversion methods.
7. The US has become the world's lowest-cost chemical producer outside the Middle East due to the recent surge in shale gas production, with a total of 126 investment projects worth $84 billion reported up to September 2013 by the American Chemistry Council.
8. A shift has occurred in the US from using naphtha to ethane for steam cracking installations, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being either dismantled or converted.
9. The majority of the new facilities for propane dehydrogenation will be established in China or the US, employing either the Catofin (Lummus) or Oleflex (UOP) technologies.
10. A diagram illustrating a Catofin dehydrogenation unit is provided in Figure 3.
11. The catalyst is utilized for 23 years, and its loss in activity over time is mitigated by incrementally increasing the temperature to maintain consistent dehydrogenation activity throughout the catalyst's lifespan.

1. 烷烃脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异，这使得当前市场条件非常有利。
2. 石油页岩气藏中包含大量天然气液体（NGL），如乙烷和丙烷，这些液体很容易从天然气中分离出来。
3. 美国已从使用石脑油转向使用页岩气乙烷进行蒸汽裂解，原因是乙烷供应丰富且成本低廉。
4. 预计未来几年新建成的丙烷脱氢（PDH）装置数量将大幅增加，许多装置已在全球范围内开始建设。
5. 制图右侧显示了所生产的产物。
6. 各种因素，包括高能耗需求、生产特定烯烃选择性低、石油储量减少以及油价上涨，促使石油化工行业寻找更经济的原料和更高效的转化技术。
7. 在页岩气产量激增的推动下，美国已成为除中东以外的全球最低化工生产成本国家，截至2013年9月，美国化学理事会总计统计了价值840亿美元的126个投资项目。
8. 美国已从使用石脑油转向使用乙烷进行蒸汽裂解，新建乙烷裂解装置，同时淘汰或改造石脑油裂解装置。
9. 大多数新的丙烷脱氢设施将在中国或美国建立，采用Lummus的Catofin或UOP的Oleflex技术。
10. 图3提供了Catofin脱氢单元的示意图。
11. 催化剂使用寿命为23年，通过逐步提高温度来抵消随时间推移而产生的活性损失，以在整个催化剂寿命期间保持一致的脱氢活性。
