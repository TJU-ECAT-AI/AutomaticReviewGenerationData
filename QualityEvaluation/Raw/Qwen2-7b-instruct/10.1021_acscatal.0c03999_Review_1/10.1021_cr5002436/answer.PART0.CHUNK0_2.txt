[1] "As early as 1977, Fiedorow et al. showed that Pt/Al2O3 catalysts more readily sinter in an oxygen-containing atmosphere than in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere at temperatures above 600 C."
[2] "A third important factor determining catalyst sintering is the interaction between Pt and the catalyst support. Nagai et al. reported that Pt on Al2O3 readily sinters after treatment in air at 800 C, while Pt on CeO2 remains stable due to the strong interaction between ceria and Pt."
[3] "Indeed, by hydrothermally treating γ-Al2O3 prior to impregnation, the formation of additional hydroxyl groups results in a better Pt dispersion after impregnation and calcination."
[4] "On freshly prepared catalysts a number of surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+ and Cr2+, have been identified."
[5] "This has been attributed to the ability of large alkali cations to stabilize the structure of the support, to reduce surface acidity, and/or to increase the number of active chromium sites."

Various metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx) and platinum (Pt), exhibit distinct activities and selectivities in CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins using CO2). Chromium oxide catalysts are characterized by their unique structure, with chromium species playing a central role. Chromium species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, are observed on freshly prepared catalysts. The reducibility of these species is influenced by the chromium loading and support properties. Chromium oxide catalysts on supports like alumina, silica, and zirconia display varying degrees of activity and stability. 

Alkali metals like potassium, rubidium, and cesium are known to promote both the activity and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts. This is attributed to their ability to stabilize the support structure, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active chromium sites. However, the introduction of potassium into certain chromium oxide catalysts, such as CrOx/Al2O3, CrOx/ZrO2, and CrOx/MgAl, results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. This phenomenon is hypothesized to be due to potassium forming bonds with oxygen anions, altering the Lewis acidity and coordinative unsaturation of the support, which impedes catalysis.

In contrast, platinum-based catalysts, such as those supported on alumina, are highly active in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of promoters like tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), gallium (Ga), and indium (In), and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have been intensively studied. Platinum nanoparticles, ideally dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated, are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of promoters modifies the catalytic properties of platinum, enhancing its activity and selectivity. The electronic modification of platinum by tin is believed to inhibit coke formation by facilitating the migration of coke precursors from the PtSn surface to the support.

The specific activity of catalysts is compared using their calculated specific activity, which is defined as the moles of olefin formed per mol of metal per second at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of TOF (turnover frequency) is precluded due to the complexity of the active species involved in oxide-based catalysts. The structure and activity of chromium oxide catalysts are influenced by factors such as chromium loading, support properties, and the reducibility of chromium species. Alkali metal promoters can either enhance or diminish the activity of chromium oxide catalysts, depending on the catalyst system and the interaction between the alkali metal and the support.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如铬氧化物（CrOx）和铂（Pt），在CO2-ODHP中表现出不同的活性和选择性。铬氧化物催化剂的独特结构使得铬物种在其表面发挥作用。观察到新鲜制备的催化剂上存在包括Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+在内的多种表面物种。这些物种的可还原性受到铬负载和支撑性质的影响。使用支持如氧化铝、硅胶和锆氧的铬氧化物催化剂显示出不同的活动性和稳定性。

碱金属如钾、铷和铯被证明能够促进铬氧化物催化剂的活性和选择性。这种现象归因于它们能够稳定支撑结构，减少表面酸性，并增加活性铬物种的数量。然而，在某些铬氧化物催化剂中，如CrOx/Al2O3、CrOx/ZrO2和CrOx/MgAl中引入钾会导致催化活性显著下降。这一现象被假设为钾与氧离子形成键，改变支撑的Lewis酸性和配位不饱和度，从而阻碍催化作用。

相比之下，基于铂的催化剂，特别是那些支持在氧化铝上的催化剂，在脱氢反应中非常活跃。活性位点、支撑的作用、促进剂（如锡（Sn）、锌（Zn）、镓（Ga）和铟（In））的效果以及催化剂系统中脱氢反应的机制已经进行了深入研究。理想的铂纳米颗粒，理想地分散并具有配位不饱和性，被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。促进剂的添加修改了铂的催化性质，提高了其活性和选择性。通过电子修改铂来抑制由锡形成的催化剂被认为可以阻止焦炭形成，通过促进焦炭前体从PtSn表面迁移到支撑，有效地减少了对支撑的有害影响。

催化剂的特定活性通过定义每个表中给出的特定活性进行比较，这是指在脱氢反应开始时每摩尔金属每秒形成的烯烃摩尔数。由于氧化物基催化剂涉及的活性物种的复杂性，无法使用TOF（周转频率）。铬氧化物催化剂的结构和活性受到因素如铬负载、支撑性质和铬物种的可还原性的影响。碱金属促进剂既可以增强也可以降低铬氧化物催化剂的活性，这取决于催化剂体系和金属与支撑之间的相互作用。
