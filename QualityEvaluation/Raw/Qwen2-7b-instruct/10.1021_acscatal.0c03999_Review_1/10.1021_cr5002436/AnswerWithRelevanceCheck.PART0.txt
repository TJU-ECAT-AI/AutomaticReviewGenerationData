          [1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
          [2] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
          [3] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
          [4] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
          [5] "However, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts."

          The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the formation of vanadium oxide species, with monomeric species predominating below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species in the range of 1.2 to 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species at higher loadings. The reducibility of vanadium species varies based on their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Large V2O5 crystallites are largely inactive in dehydrogenation processes. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface aids in dispersion and serves as attachment points for vanadium precursors used in catalyst preparation.

          表面积与金属负载比决定了钒氧化物物种的形成，低负载下主要为单体物种，介于1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间主要为聚合态钒物种，而高负载时则主要为结晶性V2O5物种。不同分子结构的钒物种的可还原性不同，VOV和VO键比VO-支持键更容易被还原。大型V2O5晶粒在脱氢过程中基本无活性。支持表面的羟基团的存在有助于分散并作为用于催化剂制备的钒前体的附着点。

          [1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
          [2] "In fact, the United States already obtains one-quarter of their natural gas production from shale gas deposits, and this is expected to rise even further in the coming years due to the emphasis that is being given to the attainment of energy independence."
          [3] "In 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."

          Demand for building blocks has consistently grown over the past years, with most major markets experiencing positive growth in demand and production, except for the Eurozone, due to recent economic downturn effects. Currently, the US obtains approximately a quarter of its natural gas production from shale gas deposits, with this proportion expected to increase further in the coming years due to the focus on achieving energy independence. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced through targeted methods, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the majority of propylene production.

          基础构件的需求在过去几年中持续增长，除欧元区外，几乎所有主要市场的需求和生产均出现积极增长，这是由于最近的经济衰退影响。目前，美国从页岩气生产中获取约四分之一的天然气产量，这一比例预计将在未来几年进一步增加，因为人们越来越重视实现能源独立。2007年，仅约3%的丙烯通过特定方法生产，而FCC和蒸汽裂解则占主要的丙烯生产。

          [1] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201)"
          [2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation."
          [3] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."

          The nature of vanadium on the catalyst is significantly influenced by the carrier type, support surface area, metal loading, and vanadium oxidation state. The presence of hydroxyl groups on the support surface is crucial for a well-dispersed catalyst, as they act as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Acid sites negatively impact catalyst performance, promoting cracking and coke formation. Wu et al. noted that monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species are present between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominate at higher loadings.

          催化剂上的钒性质主要受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载量和钒氧化状态的影响。支持表面的羟基团的存在对于催化剂的分散至关重要，它们作为用于制备催化剂的钒前体的附着点。酸性位点对催化剂性能产生负面影响，促进裂解和焦炭形成。吴等人（Wu et al.）指出，在低于1.2 V/nm2时主要存在单体物种，在1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间主要存在聚集体物种，而在更高负载时主要存在结晶性V2O5物种。
