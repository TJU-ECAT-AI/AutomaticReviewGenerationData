The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is influenced by the formation and behavior of Cr3+ and Cr2+ species. The active sites for dehydrogenation reactions are proposed to be Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, or a mixture of both. Cr6+ and Cr5+ species are not active for the dehydrogenation reaction. Below monolayer coverage, the linear relationship between activity and Cr loading suggests the presence of both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers. Initially, the selectivity towards alkenes is low, producing mainly carbon oxides. The extent of activity is dependent on the UVvis spectroscopy of the catalyst after regeneration. The use of zirconia as a support has been investigated, with Cr/ZrO2 catalysts outperforming alumina- and silica-supported counterparts. However, further improvements could be achieved by increasing the surface area and thermal stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2.

在载有Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种的演化随负载和载体属性的变化受到Cr3+和Cr2+物种的形成和行为的影响。作为脱氢反应活性位点的提出物种包括Cr3+、配位不饱和Cr2+或二者的混合物。Cr6+和Cr5+物种对于脱氢反应并不活跃。在单层覆盖度以下，活动与Cr负载之间近乎线性的关系表明存在孤立的和簇状的Cr3+中心。最初，向烯烃的选择性较低，主要产生二氧化碳。催化剂再生后的紫外可见光谱可以衡量活动的范围。已经调查了使用锆作为支持的可能性，Cr/ZrO2催化剂优于氧化铝和二氧化硅支持的催化剂。然而，可以通过增加Cr2O3/ZrO2的表面面积和热稳定性来进一步改善性能。
