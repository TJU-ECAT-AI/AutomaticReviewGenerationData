[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."

Various metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium oxide (VOx), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), and indium oxide (In2O3), are compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (CO2-ODHP). These catalysts are evaluated based on their ability to convert hydrocarbons into olefins efficiently while minimizing coke deposition. The performance criteria include the yield of olefins, stability (deactivation rate), and the space velocity (weight hourly space velocity, WHSV) at which the initial yields were achieved.

Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the surface area-to-metal loading ratio, the presence of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites, the reducibility of the metal species, and the support properties. Metal oxides with appropriate metal loading and support interactions tend to show better activity and selectivity.

Metal oxide catalysts generally deactivate quickly due to coke deposition, which leads to a decrease in conversion and selectivity. Catalyst systems that achieve high yields with minimal deactivation are preferred for practical applications.

For instance, the vanadium oxide catalysts exhibit varying activity depending on the type of carrier, with monomeric species being predominant at lower loadings, polymeric species at intermediate loadings, and crystalline V2O5 species at higher loadings. This variation in species composition influences their catalytic activity.

Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and indium oxide (In2O3) catalysts are active for CO2-ODHP, but their performance is influenced by the support properties and the presence of acid sites, which can either enhance or inhibit the catalytic activity.

Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) catalysts, while active, tend to deactivate rapidly due to coke formation and have a relatively low conversion and selectivity. 

Overall, the choice of metal oxide catalyst, its loading, and support play crucial roles in determining its performance for CO2-ODHP. The ability to maintain high yields with minimal deactivation over prolonged operation periods is a key consideration for practical applications in the chemical industry.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如钒氧化物（VOx）、钼氧化物（MoOx）、镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和铟氧化物（In2O3），在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中与烃类反应生成烯烃并最小化焦炭沉积的情况下进行比较。这些催化剂基于它们有效地转换烃类并同时减少焦炭沉积的能力进行评估。

影响其催化性能的关键因素包括表面积与金属负载比、酸性和碱性位点的存在、金属物种的可还原性以及支持材料的性质。具有适当金属负载和支持相互作用的金属氧化物倾向于显示更好的活性和选择性。

金属氧化物催化剂由于焦炭沉积而快速失活，导致转化率和选择性降低。表现出高产率且失活率低的催化剂系统是首选的工业应用。

例如，钒氧化物催化剂的活性取决于载体类型，在较低负载下主要为单体物种，在中间负载下为聚合物种，在较高负载下为结晶V2O5物种。这种物种组成的变化影响其催化活性。

镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和铟氧化物（In2O3）催化剂对CO2-ODHP有活性，但其性能受到支持材料性质和酸位的影响，这些酸位可能增强或抑制催化活性。

钼氧化物（MoOx）催化剂虽然活性，但由于焦炭形成而快速失活，并且具有相对较低的转化率和选择性。

总的来说，选择金属氧化物催化剂、其负载和支撑对于确定CO2-ODHP中的性能至关重要。维持高产率并减少长时间操作期间的失活是实际应用中的关键考虑因素。
