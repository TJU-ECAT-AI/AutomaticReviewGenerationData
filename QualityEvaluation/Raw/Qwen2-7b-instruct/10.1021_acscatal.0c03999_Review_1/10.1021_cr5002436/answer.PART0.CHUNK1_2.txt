[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form."
[2] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[3] "The reducibility of the vanadium species depends on their molecular structure, VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds."
[4] "On the contrary, large V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive in dehydrogenation."
[5] "However, the reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon feed results in the formation of V4+ and V3+."
[6] "V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species by treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600 C."
[7] "If these basic sites are absent, as in the case of SiO2, no beneficial effects of CO2 are observed."
[8] "Sokolov et al. concluded through testing a wide range of Si- and Al-based supports that using silica to dope the alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity."
[9] "According to these workers, the increase in dehydrogenation selectivity stems from the basic nature of MgO, resulting in reduced coke formation."

1. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the formation of vanadium oxide species on the catalyst support.
2. Monomeric vanadium species dominate at low loading, while polymeric species are prevalent at intermediate loadings, and crystalline V2O5 dominates at high loadings.
3. The reducibility of vanadium species varies by molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being easier to reduce than VO-support bonds.
4. Large V2O5 crystallites are largely inactive in dehydrogenation reactions.
5. The catalyst reduction by hydrocarbon feed leads to the formation of V4+ and V3+ species.
6. Treating the catalyst under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C can revert V2O5 crystallites to active polymeric vanadium species.
7. CO2 exhibits no beneficial effects when basic sites are absent on the catalyst support, such as in SiO2.
8. Using silica to dope an alumina support provides beneficial effects on catalyst stability and activity, as per Sokolov et al.'s findings.
9. The basic nature of MgO in catalysts contributes to increased dehydrogenation selectivity by reducing coke formation.

1. 催化剂支持上氧化钒物种的形成取决于表面积与金属负载比。
2. 在低负载下，单体钒物种占主导地位，而介电物种在中等负载下盛行，高负载下主要为结晶性V2O5物种。
3. 氧化钒物种的可还原性因分子结构而异，VOV和VO键比VO-支持键更容易还原。
4. 大型V2O5晶粒在脱氢反应中基本无活性。
5. 催化剂由烃流体还原导致形成V4+和V3+物种。
6. 在600°C的氧气气氛下处理催化剂可以将V2O5晶粒重新转化为活性聚态钒物种。
7. 当催化基质上基本站点缺失时，如SiO2，CO2没有有益效果。
8. 根据Sokolov等人通过测试一系列Si-和Al基材料得出结论，使用硅酸盐填充氧化铝基质提供了对催化剂稳定性和活性的有利影响。
9. MgO在催化剂中的碱性性质通过减少焦炭形成增加了脱氢选择性。
