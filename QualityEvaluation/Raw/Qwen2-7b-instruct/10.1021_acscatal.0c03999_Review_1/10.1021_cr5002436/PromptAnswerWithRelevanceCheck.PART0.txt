[1] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[2] "Indeed, metal oxide-based catalysts deactivate too fast, mainly due to coke deposition and to the fact that their activity cannot be fully recovered by a regeneration step."
[3] "The process of coke formation is very complex and not very well understood. Brnsted acid and others active sites of the catalysts serve as seeding points to which olefins and paraffins are added until large graphitic structures are formed."
[4] "Coke species may grow from the resulting aromatic rings by either DielsAlder-type addition, propylene addition to a radical, or fusion of smaller domains into larger ones."
[5] "However, because the dehydrogenation reaction is an equilibrium-controlled reaction, compounds can react back and forth leading to isotopic scrambling, which complicates the interpretation of experimental results."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Various metal oxide catalysts, such as vanadium oxide (VOx), molybdenum oxide (MoOx), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), and indium oxide (In2O3), are compared in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons (CO2-ODHP). These catalysts are evaluated based on their ability to convert hydrocarbons into olefins efficiently while minimizing coke deposition. The performance criteria include the yield of olefins, stability (deactivation rate), and the space velocity (weight hourly space velocity, WHSV) at which the initial yields were achieved.

Key factors influencing their catalytic performance include the surface area-to-metal loading ratio, the presence of Brnsted and Lewis acid sites, the reducibility of the metal species, and the support properties. Metal oxides with appropriate metal loading and support interactions tend to show better activity and selectivity.

Metal oxide catalysts generally deactivate quickly due to coke deposition, which leads to a decrease in conversion and selectivity. Catalyst systems that achieve high yields with minimal deactivation are preferred for practical applications.

For instance, the vanadium oxide catalysts exhibit varying activity depending on the type of carrier, with monomeric species being predominant at lower loadings, polymeric species at intermediate loadings, and crystalline V2O5 species at higher loadings. This variation in species composition influences their catalytic activity.

Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and indium oxide (In2O3) catalysts are active for CO2-ODHP, but their performance is influenced by the support properties and the presence of acid sites, which can either enhance or inhibit the catalytic activity.

Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) catalysts, while active, tend to deactivate rapidly due to coke formation and have a relatively low conversion and selectivity. 

Overall, the choice of metal oxide catalyst, its loading, and support play crucial roles in determining its performance for CO2-ODHP. The ability to maintain high yields with minimal deactivation over prolonged operation periods is a key consideration for practical applications in the chemical industry.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如钒氧化物（VOx）、钼氧化物（MoOx）、镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和铟氧化物（In2O3），在二氧化碳辅助氧化脱氢（CO2-ODHP）中与烃类反应生成烯烃并最小化焦炭沉积的情况下进行比较。这些催化剂基于它们有效地转换烃类并同时减少焦炭沉积的能力进行评估。

影响其催化性能的关键因素包括表面积与金属负载比、酸性和碱性位点的存在、金属物种的可还原性以及支持材料的性质。具有适当金属负载和支持相互作用的金属氧化物倾向于显示更好的活性和选择性。

金属氧化物催化剂由于焦炭沉积而快速失活，导致转化率和选择性降低。表现出高产率且失活率低的催化剂系统是首选的工业应用。

例如，钒氧化物催化剂的活性取决于载体类型，在较低负载下主要为单体物种，在中间负载下为聚合物种，在较高负载下为结晶V2O5物种。这种物种组成的变化影响其催化活性。

镓氧化物（Ga2O3）和铟氧化物（In2O3）催化剂对CO2-ODHP有活性，但其性能受到支持材料性质和酸位的影响，这些酸位可能增强或抑制催化活性。

钼氧化物（MoOx）催化剂虽然活性，但由于焦炭形成而快速失活，并且具有相对较低的转化率和选择性。

总的来说，选择金属氧化物催化剂、其负载和支撑对于确定CO2-ODHP中的性能至关重要。维持高产率并减少长时间操作期间的失活是实际应用中的关键考虑因素。

The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is influenced by the formation and behavior of Cr3+ and Cr2+ species. The active sites for dehydrogenation reactions are proposed to be Cr3+, coordinatively unsaturated Cr2+, or a mixture of both. Cr6+ and Cr5+ species are not active for the dehydrogenation reaction. Below monolayer coverage, the linear relationship between activity and Cr loading suggests the presence of both isolated and clustered Cr3+ centers. Initially, the selectivity towards alkenes is low, producing mainly carbon oxides. The extent of activity is dependent on the UVvis spectroscopy of the catalyst after regeneration. The use of zirconia as a support has been investigated, with Cr/ZrO2 catalysts outperforming alumina- and silica-supported counterparts. However, further improvements could be achieved by increasing the surface area and thermal stability of Cr2O3/ZrO2.

[2] "A third important factor determining catalyst sintering is the interaction between Pt and the catalyst support. Nagai et al. reported that Pt on Al2O3 readily sinters after treatment in air at 800 C, while Pt on CeO2 remains stable due to the strong interaction between ceria and Pt."

Various metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium oxide (CrOx) and platinum (Pt), exhibit distinct activities and selectivities in CO2-ODHP (oxidative dehydrogenation of paraffins using CO2). Chromium oxide catalysts are characterized by their unique structure, with chromium species playing a central role. Chromium species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+, are observed on freshly prepared catalysts. The reducibility of these species is influenced by the chromium loading and support properties. Chromium oxide catalysts on supports like alumina, silica, and zirconia display varying degrees of activity and stability. 

Alkali metals like potassium, rubidium, and cesium are known to promote both the activity and selectivity of chromium oxide catalysts. This is attributed to their ability to stabilize the support structure, reduce surface acidity, and increase the number of active chromium sites. However, the introduction of potassium into certain chromium oxide catalysts, such as CrOx/Al2O3, CrOx/ZrO2, and CrOx/MgAl, results in a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity. This phenomenon is hypothesized to be due to potassium forming bonds with oxygen anions, altering the Lewis acidity and coordinative unsaturation of the support, which impedes catalysis.

In contrast, platinum-based catalysts, such as those supported on alumina, are highly active in dehydrogenation reactions. The nature of the active sites, the role of the support, the effect of promoters like tin (Sn), zinc (Zn), gallium (Ga), and indium (In), and the mechanism of the dehydrogenation reaction over these catalysts have been intensively studied. Platinum nanoparticles, ideally dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated, are believed to be the active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The addition of promoters modifies the catalytic properties of platinum, enhancing its activity and selectivity. The electronic modification of platinum by tin is believed to inhibit coke formation by facilitating the migration of coke precursors from the PtSn surface to the support.

The specific activity of catalysts is compared using their calculated specific activity, which is defined as the moles of olefin formed per mol of metal per second at the start of the dehydrogenation reaction. The use of TOF (turnover frequency) is precluded due to the complexity of the active species involved in oxide-based catalysts. The structure and activity of chromium oxide catalysts are influenced by factors such as chromium loading, support properties, and the reducibility of chromium species. Alkali metal promoters can either enhance or diminish the activity of chromium oxide catalysts, depending on the catalyst system and the interaction between the alkali metal and the support.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如铬氧化物（CrOx）和铂（Pt），在CO2-ODHP中表现出不同的活性和选择性。铬氧化物催化剂的独特结构使得铬物种在其表面发挥作用。观察到新鲜制备的催化剂上存在包括Cr6+、Cr5+、Cr3+和Cr2+在内的多种表面物种。这些物种的可还原性受到铬负载和支撑性质的影响。使用支持如氧化铝、硅胶和锆氧的铬氧化物催化剂显示出不同的活动性和稳定性。

碱金属如钾、铷和铯被证明能够促进铬氧化物催化剂的活性和选择性。这种现象归因于它们能够稳定支撑结构，减少表面酸性，并增加活性铬物种的数量。然而，在某些铬氧化物催化剂中，如CrOx/Al2O3、CrOx/ZrO2和CrOx/MgAl中引入钾会导致催化活性显著下降。这一现象被假设为钾与氧离子形成键，改变支撑的Lewis酸性和配位不饱和度，从而阻碍催化作用。

相比之下，基于铂的催化剂，特别是那些支持在氧化铝上的催化剂，在脱氢反应中非常活跃。活性位点、支撑的作用、促进剂（如锡（Sn）、锌（Zn）、镓（Ga）和铟（In））的效果以及催化剂系统中脱氢反应的机制已经进行了深入研究。理想的铂纳米颗粒，理想地分散并具有配位不饱和性，被认为是脱氢反应的活性位点。促进剂的添加修改了铂的催化性质，提高了其活性和选择性。通过电子修改铂来抑制由锡形成的催化剂被认为可以阻止焦炭形成，通过促进焦炭前体从PtSn表面迁移到支撑，有效地减少了对支撑的有害影响。

催化剂的特定活性通过定义每个表中给出的特定活性进行比较，这是指在脱氢反应开始时每摩尔金属每秒形成的烯烃摩尔数。由于氧化物基催化剂涉及的活性物种的复杂性，无法使用TOF（周转频率）。铬氧化物催化剂的结构和活性受到因素如铬负载、支撑性质和铬物种的可还原性的影响。碱金属促进剂既可以增强也可以降低铬氧化物催化剂的活性，这取决于催化剂体系和金属与支撑之间的相互作用。

Vanadium oxide catalysts play a crucial role in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences the type of vanadium species formed. Monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric species exist between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominate at higher loadings. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are vital for a well-dispersed catalyst, serving as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Large V2O5 crystallites are generally inactive in dehydrogenation processes. The reducibility of vanadium species varies with their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Reducing catalysts with H2 or CH4 can introduce detrimental OH groups. Deactivation initially occurs due to strong adsorption of reactants and minor coke deposition. Calcination of the catalyst can lead to further deactivation as vanadium oxide species sinter, forming larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides, which are less active. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C. Adding MgO to vanadium oxide catalysts can enhance performance, acting as a promoter or component of a mixed oxide.

范德华氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中起着关键作用。表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同类型的钒物种形成。在低于1.2 V/nm2的负载下，主要形成单体物种；介于1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间时，形成聚集体物种；高于此范围则主要为V2O5晶粒。支持表面的羟基团对于催化剂的分散至关重要，作为用于制备催化剂的钒前体的锚定点。较大的V2O5晶粒通常在脱氢过程中活性较低。不同分子结构的钒物种的可还原性不同，VOV和VO键比VO-支持键更容易被还原。通过H2或CH4对催化剂进行还原可能会引入有害的羟基团。初始失活由反应物强烈吸附和少量焦炭沉积引起。通过煅烧催化剂可能导致进一步失活，因为氧化物物种聚集形成更大的V2O5晶粒或混合氧化物，这些物质的活性较低。在600°C的氧气气氛下，V2O5晶粒可以恢复为活性聚态钒物种。添加MgO到钒氧化物催化剂中可以提高性能，既可以作为促进剂也可以作为混酸氧化物的成分。

The demand for light olefins, such as propylene and ethylene, has been steadily increasing, with all major markets experiencing positive growth except for the Eurozone due to economic downturn. The US is now obtaining a quarter of its natural gas production from shale gas deposits, with this proportion expected to grow further due to energy independence efforts. The increased supply of natural gas has led to a significant drop in gas costs, making shale gas a more attractive energy source and feedstock for producing transportation fuels and chemicals. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced using on-purpose techniques, with the majority coming from FCC and steam cracking. The supply of propylene has dropped and its price has risen, creating opportunities for catalytic dehydrogenation technologies, particularly for light paraffins. Propane dehydrogenation profitability is heavily influenced by the price difference between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable. The demand for butadiene has increased, partly due to the automotive industry, while supply has decreased due to the high cost of naphtha cracking, leading to sharp increases in butadiene prices and investment in new butane dehydrogenation installations in the US, China, and Japan. The availability of ethane has led to a shift in steam cracking installations in the US from naphtha to shale-based ethane, with ethane crackers being constructed and naphtha crackers being dismantled or converted. Shale gas production has enabled the US to become the lowest cost chemical producer outside the Middle East, with 126 investment projects totaling $84 billion made by the American Chemistry Council up to September 2013. Approximately 5 million tons of propylene are produced annually by propane dehydrogenation, a number expected to increase significantly in the coming years with dozens of new installations announced globally, many already under construction.

这些基础化学品的需求在过去几年中一直稳步增长，所有主要市场均出现了积极的增长，除了欧元区，由于经济衰退的影响。美国现在从页岩气生产中获得其天然气产量的四分之一，这一比例预计将在未来进一步增长，因为人们越来越重视实现能源独立。随着天然气供应量的增加，天然气成本大幅下降，使得页岩气成为更具有吸引力的能源来源和生产运输燃料或化学物质的原料。在2007年，仅约3%的丙烯是通过专门技术生产的，而大多数则来自于催化裂化和蒸汽裂解。丙烯的供应量减少，价格飙升，为轻质烷烃的催化脱氢技术提供了机会，尤其是对于生成相应的烯烃。丙烯的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烯和丙烷的价格差异，这使得当前市场条件非常有利。丁二烯的需求有所增加，特别是汽车行业的推动，而供给却因裂解石脑油成本高昂而减少，导致丁二烯价格上涨并刺激了在美国、中国和日本对新的丁烷脱氢装置的投资。乙烷的高可用性导致美国的裂解装置从石脑油转向页岩基乙烷，石脑油裂解装置被拆除或转换。页岩气生产的繁荣使美国成为了除中东以外的最低成本的化工生产国，到2013年9月，美国化学理事会统计了总计840亿美元的126个投资项目。目前每年大约有500万吨丙烯通过丙烷脱氢生产，这个数字在未来几年预计将显著增加，因为全球宣布了数十个新装置，并且许多装置已经在建设中。

[1] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201)"
[2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation."
[3] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[4] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."

1. The vanadium present on the catalyst is influenced by the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and vanadium oxidation state.

2. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface aid in dispersion and anchor vanadium precursors, while acid sites hinder performance by promoting cracking and coke formation.

3. Monomeric vanadium species dominate at low loadings, polymeric species at moderate loadings, and crystalline V2O5 at high loadings, according to Wu et al.'s findings.

4. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the formation of vanadium species. Monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric species between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and V2O5 crystals at higher loadings, as reported by Wu et al.

1. 催化剂上的钒性质主要受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载量和钒氧化状态的影响。

2. 支持表面的羟基团有助于分散并锚定用于制备催化剂的钒前体，而酸性位点则损害了催化剂性能，因为它们促进了裂解和焦炭形成。

3. 根据吴等人（Wu et al.）的研究结果，在低负载下主要存在单体钒物种，在中等负载下主要存在聚集体物种，而在高负载下主要存在结晶V2O5物种。

4. 表面面积与金属负载的比例决定了钒物种的形成。在低于1.2 V/nm2时主要存在单体物种，在1.2到4.4 V/nm2之间主要存在聚集体物种，而在更高负载时主要存在V2O5晶体，这是吴等人（Wu et al.）的研究发现。

[1] "The demand of these building blocks has increased steadily over the last years, all major markets registering a positive growth in demand and production in recent years with the exception of the Eurozone, due to the effects of the recent economic downturn."
[2] "In Figure 1, the uses as well as the recent and predicted future growth of the olefin supply and demand are shown."
[3] "For example, in 2007 less than 3% of propylene was produced by on-purpose techniques, while FCC and steam cracking accounted for the bulk of the propylene produced."
[4] "This increased supply of natural gas has resulted in a drop in gas costs of about 75% relative to 2005 prices, making this shale gas very attractive both as an energy source and as feedstock for the production of transportation fuels or chemicals."

[9] "The Star (UHDE) process will be applied for the first time in two installations in the Middle East."
[10] "Moreover, alkane conversion has been found to be inversely proportional to space velocity, and selectivity has been found to be directly proportional to alkene selectivity."
[11] "Indeed, experiments performed using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM), shown in Figure 17, revealed that the weight of the catalyst increases during the initial stages (10-40 min) of the reaction, no additional carbon being deposited after this time."
[12] "In the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, catalysts with a strong reduction peak at low temperatures show the highest catalytic activity."

1. The demand for light olefin building blocks has consistently grown over the past years, except in the Eurozone due to economic downturn effects. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate the recent and forecasted growth in olefin supply and demand. In 2007, less than 3% of propylene was produced through targeted methods, with FCC and steam cracking accounting for the majority of propylene production. The surge in shale gas production has significantly lowered gas costs, making it an attractive energy source and feedstock for chemical production. This has transformed the US into the world's lowest-cost chemical producer, excluding the Middle East, with 126 investment projects totaling $84 billion recorded up to September 2013 by the American Chemistry Council. Shale gas deposits contain substantial amounts of natural gas liquids (NGL), including ethane and propane, which are easily separated from the natural gas. The profitability of propane dehydrogenation is largely influenced by the price disparity between propane and propylene, making current market conditions favorable. Five industrial dehydrogenation processes have been patented, with two currently in use. The Star process will debut in the Middle East for the first time. Conversion rate decreases with increased space velocity, while selectivity increases with ethylene selectivity.

2. The weight of the catalyst increases during the initial 10-40 minutes of the reaction, with no additional carbon deposition thereafter. This is shown in Figure 17 through experiments conducted using a tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM).

3. Catalysts displaying a strong reduction peak at low temperatures exhibit the highest catalytic activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.

1. 近年来，轻质烯烃构建块的需求持续增长，除了欧元区，这归因于经济衰退的影响。图1和图2展示了轻质烯烃供应与需求的近期和预测增长。2007年，仅约3%的丙烯通过特定方法生产，而FCC和蒸汽裂解则占主要的丙烯生产。天然气产量的激增显著降低了天然气成本，使其作为能源来源和化学品生产的原料非常有吸引力。这使得美国成为除中东以外的世界最低成本化工生产国，截至2013年9月，美国化学理事会记录了126个总投资项目，总额为840亿美元。页岩气储备中含有大量天然气体液体（NGL），包括乙烷和丙烷，这些可以通过分离从天然气中提取。丙烷脱氢的盈利能力很大程度上取决于丙烷和丙烯的价格差异，当前市场条件十分有利。已经批准了五种工业脱氢过程专利，其中两种正在使用中。Star工艺将在中东首次应用。转化率随空间速度增加而减少，乙烯选择性随选择性增加而增加。

2. 在前40分钟内，催化剂的重量在反应初期增加，之后不再增加额外的碳沉积。这是通过使用锥形元件振荡微平衡仪（TEOM）进行的实验，在图17中显示。

3. 在非氧化脱氢化乙烷过程中，显示出低温强还原峰的催化剂表现出最高的催化活性。
