Vanadium oxide catalysts play a crucial role in alkane dehydrogenation reactions. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio influences the type of vanadium species formed. Monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric species exist between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species dominate at higher loadings. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface are vital for a well-dispersed catalyst, serving as anchoring sites for vanadium precursors. Large V2O5 crystallites are generally inactive in dehydrogenation processes. The reducibility of vanadium species varies with their molecular structure, with VOV and VO bonds being more easily reduced than VO-support bonds. Reducing catalysts with H2 or CH4 can introduce detrimental OH groups. Deactivation initially occurs due to strong adsorption of reactants and minor coke deposition. Calcination of the catalyst can lead to further deactivation as vanadium oxide species sinter, forming larger V2O5 crystallites or mixed oxides, which are less active. V2O5 crystallites can revert to active polymeric vanadium species under an oxygen atmosphere at 600°C. Adding MgO to vanadium oxide catalysts can enhance performance, acting as a promoter or component of a mixed oxide.

范德华氧化物催化剂在烷烃脱氢反应中起着关键作用。表面面积与金属负载比决定了不同类型的钒物种形成。在低于1.2 V/nm2的负载下，主要形成单体物种；介于1.2至4.4 V/nm2之间时，形成聚集体物种；高于此范围则主要为V2O5晶粒。支持表面的羟基团对于催化剂的分散至关重要，作为用于制备催化剂的钒前体的锚定点。较大的V2O5晶粒通常在脱氢过程中活性较低。不同分子结构的钒物种的可还原性不同，VOV和VO键比VO-支持键更容易被还原。通过H2或CH4对催化剂进行还原可能会引入有害的羟基团。初始失活由反应物强烈吸附和少量焦炭沉积引起。通过煅烧催化剂可能导致进一步失活，因为氧化物物种聚集形成更大的V2O5晶粒或混合氧化物，这些物质的活性较低。在600°C的氧气气氛下，V2O5晶粒可以恢复为活性聚态钒物种。添加MgO到钒氧化物催化剂中可以提高性能，既可以作为促进剂也可以作为混酸氧化物的成分。
