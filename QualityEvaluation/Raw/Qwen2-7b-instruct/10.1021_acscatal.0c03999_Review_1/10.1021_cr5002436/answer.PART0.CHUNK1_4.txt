[1] "The nature of the vanadium present on the catalyst depends to a large extent on the type of carrier, the support surface area, the metal loading, and the oxidation state of vanadium. (201)"
[2] "On the one hand, the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of the support is important to obtain a well-dispersed catalyst, as OH groups serve as anchoring sites for the vanadium precursors used to prepare these catalysts. On the other hand, acid sites are detrimental for catalyst performance, because they facilitate cracking and induce coke formation."
[3] "Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."
[4] "The surface area-to-metal loading ratio determines which species will form. Indeed, Wu et al. reported that monomeric species are predominantly present below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric vanadium species prevail between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and crystalline V2O5 species preponderate at even higher loadings."

1. The vanadium present on the catalyst is influenced by the type of carrier, support surface area, metal loading, and vanadium oxidation state.

2. Hydroxyl groups on the support surface aid in dispersion and anchor vanadium precursors, while acid sites hinder performance by promoting cracking and coke formation.

3. Monomeric vanadium species dominate at low loadings, polymeric species at moderate loadings, and crystalline V2O5 at high loadings, according to Wu et al.'s findings.

4. The surface area-to-metal loading ratio dictates the formation of vanadium species. Monomeric species are predominant below 1.2 V/nm2, polymeric species between 1.2 and 4.4 V/nm2, and V2O5 crystals at higher loadings, as reported by Wu et al.

1. 催化剂上的钒性质主要受到载体类型、支持表面面积、金属负载量和钒氧化状态的影响。

2. 支持表面的羟基团有助于分散并锚定用于制备催化剂的钒前体，而酸性位点则损害了催化剂性能，因为它们促进了裂解和焦炭形成。

3. 根据吴等人（Wu et al.）的研究结果，在低负载下主要存在单体钒物种，在中等负载下主要存在聚集体物种，而在高负载下主要存在结晶V2O5物种。

4. 表面面积与金属负载的比例决定了钒物种的形成。在低于1.2 V/nm2时主要存在单体物种，在1.2到4.4 V/nm2之间主要存在聚集体物种，而在更高负载时主要存在V2O5晶体，这是吴等人（Wu et al.）的研究发现。
