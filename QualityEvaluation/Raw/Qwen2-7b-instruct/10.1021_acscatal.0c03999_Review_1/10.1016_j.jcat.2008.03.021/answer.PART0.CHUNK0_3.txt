[1] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8."
[2] "Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."
[3] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."
[4] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions is suggested to play a key role in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, which makes GaxAl10xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction."
[5] "The simple oxide of γ -Al2O3 demonstrated very low activity, consistent with the inferior activity of alumina and other metal oxides reported in the literature."
[6] "For all of the Ga-containing materials, the selectivity to propylene was always high (>91%), whereas the highest conversion of propane was 51.7%."
[7] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples."
[8] "In contrast, the propylene yields were increased markedly by the introduction of aluminum in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the runs for 8 h."
[9] "The amounts of coke deposited on the four Ga-containing catalysts in both processes evaluated by TGA, given in Table 1, indicate that the markedly enhanced stability of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to their low coking tendency as a function of time on stream."
[10] "The essential nature of tetrahedral Ga3+ population in contributing to weak surface acidity, provides strong evidence of the key role of surface tetrahedral Ga3+ sites in propane dehydrogenation."
[11] "Remarkable stability for propane dehydrogenation was recently reported for an HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3 catalyst at 873 K, but at the expense of marked side reactions, such as propane aromatization."
[12] "Attempts were made to regenerate the deactivated γ -Ga2O3, Ga8Al2O15, and Ga5Al5O15 catalysts subjected to 8 h of reaction in the absence of CO2 by recalcining the used catalysts in flowing air at 823 K for 4 h, followed by subsequent purging with N2."

1. The maximum activity for the dehydrogenation of propane was observed for x = 8 in the mixed GaxAl10xO15 oxides. Higher aluminum content in Ga2O3Al2O3 resulted in significantly enhanced stability.

2. The presence of Ga species is indispensable for the genesis of catalytically active sites for alkane dehydrogenation, as demonstrated by the very low activity of the simple oxide of γ -Al2O3.

3. For all Ga-containing materials, the selectivity to propylene was high, while the highest conversion of propane was 51.7%. 

4. The introduction of carbon dioxide did not always promote the dehydrogenation of propane across all samples.

5. Aluminum incorporation increased the propylene yields in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide.

6. The γ -Ga2O3 catalyst showed rapid deactivation in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide, whereas the Ga5Al5O15 catalyst exhibited remarkable stability.

7. The formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions played a key role in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, enhancing the activity and stability of the reaction.

8. The low coking tendency of the GaxAl10xO15 catalysts in the presence of CO2 was attributed to their stability over time.

9. Tetrahedral Ga3+ sites were crucial in creating the surface acidity of the mixed oxides, leading to high activity and stability.

10. An HZSM-5-supported Ga2O3 catalyst exhibited remarkable stability but at the cost of side reactions, such as propane aromatization.

11. The regeneration of deactivated γ -Ga2O3, Ga8Al2O15, and Ga5Al5O15 catalysts was successful in removing carbon species, with the Ga5Al5O15 catalyst showing particularly stable performance.
