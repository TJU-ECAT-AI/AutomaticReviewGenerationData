[1] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8. Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."
[2] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."
[3] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions is suggested to play a key role in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, which makes GaxAl10xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction."

1. The maximum initial activity was observed when x equals 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides. This tendency was also seen when normalizing the specific activity by the BET surface area. Ga2O3Al2O3 with a higher aluminum content showed significantly enhanced stability.

2. There is a correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15. A high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations plays an important role in achieving high activity.

3. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions is suggested to be a key factor in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, making GaxAl10xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction.

1. 当x等于8时，GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的最大初始活性被观察到。同样的趋势在通过BET表面积归一化特定活性时也被观察到。具有更高铝含量的Ga2O3Al2O3表现出显著增强的稳定性。

2. 对于GaxAl10xO15，NH3-TPD结果与初始活性之间存在相关性。与四面体Ga3+离子相关的表面酸位的高群体对实现高活性起着重要作用。

3. 由于γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3固溶体的形成，Ga2O3和Al2O3之间的特定相互作用被认为是分散和分布表面镓位的关键因素，这使得GaxAl10xO15复合材料在反应中高度活性且稳定。
