[1] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8."
[2] "Whereas the same tendency was observed for the specific activity normalized by BET surface area, significantly enhanced stability was achieved for Ga2O3Al2O3 with higher aluminum content."
[3] "A correlation between the NH3-TPD results and the initial activity for GaxAl10xO15 reveals that a high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is important to achieving high activity."
[4] "The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions is suggested to play a key role in the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, which makes GaxAl10xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction."
[5] "For all of the Ga-containing materials, the selectivity to propylene was always high (>91%), whereas the highest conversion of propane was 51.7%."
[6] "Moreover, the promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples."
[7] "In contrast, the propylene yields were increased markedly by the introduction of aluminum in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in the runs for 8 h."
[8] "This indicates that weak surface acidity (specifically, weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is crucial to achieving high activity and stability."

The study found that among the mixed GaxAl10xO15 oxides, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8. Higher aluminum content in Ga2O3Al2O3 led to significantly enhanced stability. A high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations plays a crucial role in achieving high activity. The specific interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 due to the formation of spinel-type γ -Ga2O3 Al2O3 solid solutions enhances the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites, making GaxAl10xO15 composites highly active and stable for the reaction. The highest conversion of propane was 51.7%, while the selectivity to propylene was always high (>91%). The promoting role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of propane was not observed in all samples. The introduction of aluminum increased the propylene yields markedly in the presence and absence of carbon dioxide. Weak surface acidity, specifically the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface, is crucial for achieving high activity and stability.

研究发现，混合GaxAl10xO15氧化物中，当x=8时，活性最大。在Ga2O3Al2O3中增加铝含量可以显著提高稳定性。表面酸性位点与四面体Ga3+离子相关联的高密度在实现高活性方面起着关键作用。Ga2O3和Al2O3之间特定的相互作用由于γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3固溶体的形成，在表面镓位点的分散和分布中起着关键作用，使得GaxAl10xO15复合材料对于反应具有高度的活性和稳定性。丙烷的最大转化率为51.7%，而丙烯的选择性始终很高（>91%）。在所有样品中，碳氧化合物促进丙烷脱氢的作用并未被观察到。在有无二氧化碳的情况下，引入铝都显著提高了丙烯的产率。弱表面酸性，即表面弱Lewis酸位点密度，对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。
