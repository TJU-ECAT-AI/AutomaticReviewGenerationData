研究发现，混合GaxAl10xO15氧化物中，当x=8时，活性最大。在Ga2O3Al2O3中增加铝含量可以显著提高稳定性。表面酸性位点与四面体Ga3+离子相关联的高密度在实现高活性方面起着关键作用。Ga2O3和Al2O3之间特定的相互作用由于γ-Ga2O3 Al2O3固溶体的形成，在表面镓位点的分散和分布中起着关键作用，使得GaxAl10xO15复合材料对于反应具有高度的活性和稳定性。丙烷的最大转化率为51.7%，而丙烯的选择性始终很高（>91%）。在所有样品中，碳氧化合物促进丙烷脱氢的作用并未被观察到。在有无二氧化碳的情况下，引入铝都显著提高了丙烯的产率。弱表面酸性，即表面弱Lewis酸位点密度，对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。
