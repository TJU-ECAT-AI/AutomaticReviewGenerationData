[1] "Among the various compositions of GaxAl10xO15, the maximum activity was observed for x = 8."
[2] "The most interesting finding of this study is the significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels for Ga5Al5O15."
[3] "The enhanced catalytic activity of GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides can be linked to the abundant specific surface acid sites related to tetrahedral surface Ga3+ sites resulting from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solution in the mixed-oxide systems."
[4] "Comparing the NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity reveals that weak surface acidity (specifically, the weak Lewis acid site density of the surface), not medium-strong surface acidity, is important for achieving high activity and stability."

1. The maximum activity for the dehydrogenation of propane was observed when x equals 8 in the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxide catalysts.
2. Ga5Al5O15 exhibited significantly enhanced stability at high conversion levels.
3. The enhanced catalytic activity of the GaxAl10xO15 mixed oxides is attributed to the abundance of specific surface acid sites associated with tetrahedral Ga3+ sites, which arise from the formation of Ga2O3Al2O3 solid solutions in the mixed-oxide systems.
4. A high population of surface acid sites related to tetrahedral Ga3+ cations is crucial for achieving high activity and stability, according to the comparison between NH3-TPD results and propane dehydrogenation activity.

1. 在GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物催化剂中，当x等于8时观察到了最大活性。
2. Ga5Al5O15在高转化率水平下表现出显著增强的稳定性。
3. GaxAl10xO15混合氧化物的增强催化活性归因于与四面体表面Ga3+位点相关的丰富特定表面酸位，这些位点来源于Ga2O3Al2O3固溶体在混合氧化物体系中的形成。
4. 根据NH3-TPD结果和丙烷脱氢化活性的比较，表明表面酸性（特别是表面弱Lewis酸位密度）的高密度对于实现高活性和稳定性至关重要。
