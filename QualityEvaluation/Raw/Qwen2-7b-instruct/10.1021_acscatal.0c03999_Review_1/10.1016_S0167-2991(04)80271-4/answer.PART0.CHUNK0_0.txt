Various metal oxide catalysts, such as silica or alumina supported chromium oxide, were used industrially for the production of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes. Chromium oxide-supported catalysts have also been explored for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes with oxygen. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized via the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Among the tested metals, chromium had the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a yield above 15% with a high selectivity over 90% for propene. The introduction of chromium maintained the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores in MCM-41. UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, attributed to O-Cr6+ charge transfer of chromates species, were observed for both Cr-MCM-41 samples. The conversion of propane increased almost linearly with an increase in chromium content, indicating that chromium is the active site for the reaction. After treatment with oxygen, the XANES and EXAFS spectra showed the regeneration of Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, while no significant changes were observed in the spectra during the reaction, even after reoxidation treatment with oxygen.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如硅酸盐或铝酸盐支持的铬氧化物，被工业上用于通过烷烃的脱氢生产丙烯和异丁烯。铬氧化物支持的催化剂也被探索用于氧气下低烷烃的氧化脱氢。通过直接水热（DHT）方法制备了Cr-MCM-41催化剂，并使用多种光谱技术进行了表征。在测试的金属中，铬在CO2脱氢丙烷中的活性最高，其次是镓、镍、钒、铁、锰和钴。当Si/Cr比为50时，Cr-MCM-41的产率超过15%，选择性超过90%为丙烯。向MCM-41引入铬维持了六方阵列的长程有序微孔结构的规则性。对于两个Cr-MCM-41样品，观察到了分配到280和370 nm的UV带，归因于Cr6+氧化物的电荷转移。随着铬含量的增加，丙烷的转化几乎呈线性增加，表明铬是反应的活性位点。在氧气处理后，XANES和EXAFS光谱显示Cr6+O4四面体的再生。在反应过程中，没有观察到光谱的显著变化，即使在用氧气进行再氧化处理之后也是如此。
