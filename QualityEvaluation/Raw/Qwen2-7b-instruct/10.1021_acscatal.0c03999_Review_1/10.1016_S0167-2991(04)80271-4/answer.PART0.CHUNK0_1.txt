[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content."
[3] "UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, which could be assigned to O-Cr6+ charge transfer of chromates species, were mainly observed for both samples."
[4] "According to the CrI-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[5] "These results also well explained the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation of Cr/Cab-O-Sil shown in Fig. 4."

The study compares the catalytic activities and selectivities of various metal oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP (Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Paraffins). Among the metals tested—chromium (Cr), gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co)—chromium shows the highest activity, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Chromium loading affects the pore diameter of the catalyst, maintaining it at 2.7 nm up to a certain ratio, even as the pore volume and surface area decrease. The presence of UV bands at 280 and 370 nm suggests the involvement of Cr6+ chromates species. Chromium undergoes a transition from tetrahedral coordination to octahedral coordination, indicating deactivation and reactivation processes. The regeneration of Cr6+ tetrahedra via reoxidation plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.

研究比较了不同金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的催化活性和选择性。在测试的金属——铬（Cr）、镓（Ga）、镍（Ni）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锰（Mn）和钴（Co）中，铬显示出最高的活性，随后是镓、镍、钒、铁、锰和钴。铬的负载影响催化剂的孔径，保持在2.7nm直到一定比例，即使孔体积和比表面积随着铬含量增加而减少。存在280和370nm的紫外光谱表明涉及Cr6+铬酸盐物种的存在。铬从四面体配合转变为八面体配合，表明了失活和再活化过程。通过重新氧化再生Cr6+四面体是催化反应的关键步骤。
