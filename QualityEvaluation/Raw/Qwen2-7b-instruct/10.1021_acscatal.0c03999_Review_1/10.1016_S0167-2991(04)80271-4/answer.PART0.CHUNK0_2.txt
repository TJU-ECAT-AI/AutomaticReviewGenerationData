[1] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were prepared by the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[3] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
[4] "The activity of Cr-MCM-41 was easily regenerated to give the original value of C3H8 conversion, but that of Cr/Cab-O-Sil was not recovered at all, by the treatment with O2."
[5] "According to the Cri-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts, with chromium-based catalysts, specifically Cr-MCM-41, demonstrating superior activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP (CO2 dehydrogenation of propane) over gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of over 15% with a high selectivity of over 90% for propene. A notable feature was the ability of Cr-MCM-41 to regenerate its activity upon treatment with oxygen, whereas the chromium-on-cab-o-sil catalyst failed to recover its original performance. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis revealed that chromium underwent a transformation from a tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ state to an octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ state post-reaction, indicating the role of chromium species in the dehydrogenation process.

研究比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是以铬为基础的催化剂Cr-MCM-41，在CO2-ODHP（丙烷CO2脱氢）反应中显示出比镓、镍、钒、铁、锰和钴等催化剂更高的活性和选择性。Cr-MCM-41催化剂在脱氢反应中表现出超过15%的产率和超过90%的选择性用于生成丙烯。值得注意的是，Cr-MCM-41催化剂能够通过氧气处理恢复其活性，而基于cab-o-sil的铬催化剂未能恢复原始性能。X射线吸收近边结构（XANES）分析表明，铬在反应后从四面体配合的Cr6+状态转变为八面体配合的Cr3+状态，这表明铬物种在脱氢过程中的作用。
