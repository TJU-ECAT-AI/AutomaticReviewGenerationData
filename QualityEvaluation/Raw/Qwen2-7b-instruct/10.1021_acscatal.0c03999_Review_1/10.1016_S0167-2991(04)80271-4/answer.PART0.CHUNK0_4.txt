[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Fig. 1)."
[2] "Cr-MCM-41 with Si/Cr=50 showed a yield above 15 % with a high selectivity above 90 % of propene."
[3] "Cr-MCM-41-DHT and Cr/Cab-O-Sil samples with both Si/Cr ratios of 50 are compared in Fig. 2."
[4] "UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, which could be assigned to O-Cr6+ charge transfer of chromates species, were mainly observed for both samples."
[5] "According to the CrI-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[6] "It was clearly observed that CO was selectively produced from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation over Cr-MCM-41."

Various metal oxide catalysts, specifically chromium oxide (Cr2O3), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), nickel oxide (NiO), vanadium oxide (VO), iron oxide (Fe2O3), manganese oxide (MnO), and cobalt oxide (CoO), were evaluated for their activity and selectivity in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP). Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by gallium oxide, nickel oxide, vanadium oxide, iron oxide, manganese oxide, and cobalt oxide. Chromium-MCM-41 with a silicon/chromium (Si/Cr) ratio of 50 displayed a yield above 15% with a high selectivity greater than 90% for propene production. Both chromium-MCM-41 and chromium-supported Cab-O-Sil samples were compared. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra demonstrated the presence of O-Cr6+ charge transfer chromates species for both samples. Chromium-MCM-41 samples showed a shift in the XANES spectrum from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, indicating the transformation of chromium species. Chromium-MCM-41 effectively produced CO selectively from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation process.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是铬氧化物（Cr2O3）、镓氧化物（Ga2O3）、镍氧化物（NiO）、钒氧化物（VO）、铁氧化物（Fe2O3）、锰氧化物（MnO）和钴氧化物（CoO），被评估用于CO2氧化脱氢（ODHP）。铬氧化物（Cr2O3）支持在MCM-41上表现出最高活性，随后是镓氧化物、镍氧化物、钒氧化物、铁氧化物、锰氧化物和钴氧化物。硅/铬（Si/Cr）比为50的铬-MCM-41显示了高于15%的产率和大于90%的丙烯选择性。铬-MCM-41和铬支持Cab-O-Sil样品进行了比较。紫外可见（UV-Vis）漫反射光谱表明两个样品中存在O-Cr6+电荷转移铬盐物种。铬-MCM-41样本的XANES光谱从Cr6+四面体协调转变为Cr3+八面体协调，这表明铬物种的转变。在C3H8脱氢过程中，铬-MCM-41有效地从CO2产生CO。
