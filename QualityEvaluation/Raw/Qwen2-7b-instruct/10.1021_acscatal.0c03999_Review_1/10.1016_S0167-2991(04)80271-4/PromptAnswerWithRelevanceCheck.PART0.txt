[1] "Silica or alumina supported chromium oxide was industrially used for the productions of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes."

Various metal oxide catalysts, such as silica or alumina supported chromium oxide, were used industrially for the production of propene and isobutene through the dehydrogenation of the corresponding alkanes. Chromium oxide-supported catalysts have also been explored for the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes with oxygen. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts were synthesized via the direct hydrothermal (DHT) method and characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. Among the tested metals, chromium had the highest activity for CO2 dehydrogenation of propane, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 with a Si/Cr ratio of 50 exhibited a yield above 15% with a high selectivity over 90% for propene. The introduction of chromium maintained the long-range regularity of hexagonal arrays of mesopores in MCM-41. UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, attributed to O-Cr6+ charge transfer of chromates species, were observed for both Cr-MCM-41 samples. The conversion of propane increased almost linearly with an increase in chromium content, indicating that chromium is the active site for the reaction. After treatment with oxygen, the XANES and EXAFS spectra showed the regeneration of Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, while no significant changes were observed in the spectra during the reaction, even after reoxidation treatment with oxygen.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，如硅酸盐或铝酸盐支持的铬氧化物，被工业上用于通过烷烃的脱氢生产丙烯和异丁烯。铬氧化物支持的催化剂也被探索用于氧气下低烷烃的氧化脱氢。通过直接水热（DHT）方法制备了Cr-MCM-41催化剂，并使用多种光谱技术进行了表征。在测试的金属中，铬在CO2脱氢丙烷中的活性最高，其次是镓、镍、钒、铁、锰和钴。当Si/Cr比为50时，Cr-MCM-41的产率超过15%，选择性超过90%为丙烯。向MCM-41引入铬维持了六方阵列的长程有序微孔结构的规则性。对于两个Cr-MCM-41样品，观察到了分配到280和370 nm的UV带，归因于Cr6+氧化物的电荷转移。随着铬含量的增加，丙烷的转化几乎呈线性增加，表明铬是反应的活性位点。在氧气处理后，XANES和EXAFS光谱显示Cr6+O4四面体的再生。在反应过程中，没有观察到光谱的显著变化，即使在用氧气进行再氧化处理之后也是如此。

[1] "Effects of metal species were tested by using Cr, Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co on MCM-41-DHT (Si/M=50), among which Cr-MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co for the CO2 dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[2] "When the Cr loading was changed on MCM-41-DHT, pore diameter was constant at 2.7 nm up to the Si/Cr ratio of 25, even though both pore volume and surface area decreased with increasing the Cr content."
[3] "UV bands at 280 and 370 nm, which could be assigned to O-Cr6+ charge transfer of chromates species, were mainly observed for both samples."
[4] "According to the CrI-edge XANES spectra for the Cr-MCM-41-DHT sample with Si/Cr ratio of 50 (Fig. 5, a & b), a preedge peak clearly observed before the reaction became very weak, and the edge position shifted to lower energy, suggesting that the chromium has been changed from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction."
[5] "These results also well explained the phenomena of deactivation and reactivation of Cr/Cab-O-Sil shown in Fig. 4."

The study compares the catalytic activities and selectivities of various metal oxide catalysts in CO2-ODHP (Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Paraffins). Among the metals tested—chromium (Cr), gallium (Ga), nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co)—chromium shows the highest activity, followed by gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Chromium loading affects the pore diameter of the catalyst, maintaining it at 2.7 nm up to a certain ratio, even as the pore volume and surface area decrease. The presence of UV bands at 280 and 370 nm suggests the involvement of Cr6+ chromates species. Chromium undergoes a transition from tetrahedral coordination to octahedral coordination, indicating deactivation and reactivation processes. The regeneration of Cr6+ tetrahedra via reoxidation plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process.

研究比较了不同金属氧化物催化剂在CO2-ODHP中的催化活性和选择性。在测试的金属——铬（Cr）、镓（Ga）、镍（Ni）、钒（V）、铁（Fe）、锰（Mn）和钴（Co）中，铬显示出最高的活性，随后是镓、镍、钒、铁、锰和钴。铬的负载影响催化剂的孔径，保持在2.7nm直到一定比例，即使孔体积和比表面积随着铬含量增加而减少。存在280和370nm的紫外光谱表明涉及Cr6+铬酸盐物种的存在。铬从四面体配合转变为八面体配合，表明了失活和再活化过程。通过重新氧化再生Cr6+四面体是催化反应的关键步骤。

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts, with chromium-based catalysts, specifically Cr-MCM-41, demonstrating superior activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP (CO2 dehydrogenation of propane) over gallium, nickel, vanadium, iron, manganese, and cobalt. Cr-MCM-41 showed a yield of over 15% with a high selectivity of over 90% for propene. A notable feature was the ability of Cr-MCM-41 to regenerate its activity upon treatment with oxygen, whereas the chromium-on-cab-o-sil catalyst failed to recover its original performance. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis revealed that chromium underwent a transformation from a tetrahedrally coordinated Cr6+ state to an octahedrally coordinated Cr3+ state post-reaction, indicating the role of chromium species in the dehydrogenation process.

The literature reports that Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, prepared through the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method, demonstrated superior activity and selectivity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The highest activity was observed for Cr-MCM-41, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed yields above 15% with a high selectivity above 90% for propene production. The study also found that Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by the template-ion exchange (TIE) method showed similar catalytic behaviors to those prepared by the DHT method. Changes in chromium loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance, with Cr-MCM-41 maintaining its high activity across a range of Si/Cr ratios. The literature indicates that the evolution of chromium species plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, with reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra being reoxidized by CO2 to regenerate Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, thus facilitating the dehydrogenation process.

Various metal oxide catalysts, specifically chromium oxide (Cr2O3), gallium oxide (Ga2O3), nickel oxide (NiO), vanadium oxide (VO), iron oxide (Fe2O3), manganese oxide (MnO), and cobalt oxide (CoO), were evaluated for their activity and selectivity in CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation (ODHP). Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) supported on MCM-41 showed the highest activity, followed by gallium oxide, nickel oxide, vanadium oxide, iron oxide, manganese oxide, and cobalt oxide. Chromium-MCM-41 with a silicon/chromium (Si/Cr) ratio of 50 displayed a yield above 15% with a high selectivity greater than 90% for propene production. Both chromium-MCM-41 and chromium-supported Cab-O-Sil samples were compared. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra demonstrated the presence of O-Cr6+ charge transfer chromates species for both samples. Chromium-MCM-41 samples showed a shift in the XANES spectrum from Cr6+ in tetrahedral coordination to Cr3+ in octahedral coordination after the reaction, indicating the transformation of chromium species. Chromium-MCM-41 effectively produced CO selectively from CO2 during the C3H8 dehydrogenation process.

各种金属氧化物催化剂，特别是铬氧化物（Cr2O3）、镓氧化物（Ga2O3）、镍氧化物（NiO）、钒氧化物（VO）、铁氧化物（Fe2O3）、锰氧化物（MnO）和钴氧化物（CoO），被评估用于CO2氧化脱氢（ODHP）。铬氧化物（Cr2O3）支持在MCM-41上表现出最高活性，随后是镓氧化物、镍氧化物、钒氧化物、铁氧化物、锰氧化物和钴氧化物。硅/铬（Si/Cr）比为50的铬-MCM-41显示了高于15%的产率和大于90%的丙烯选择性。铬-MCM-41和铬支持Cab-O-Sil样品进行了比较。紫外可见（UV-Vis）漫反射光谱表明两个样品中存在O-Cr6+电荷转移铬盐物种。铬-MCM-41样本的XANES光谱从Cr6+四面体协调转变为Cr3+八面体协调，这表明铬物种的转变。在C3H8脱氢过程中，铬-MCM-41有效地从CO2产生CO。
