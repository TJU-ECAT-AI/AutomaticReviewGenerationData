The literature reports that Cr-MCM-41 catalysts, prepared through the direct hydrothermal (DHT) synthesis method, demonstrated superior activity and selectivity in CO2 dehydrogenation of propane compared to other metal oxide catalysts. The highest activity was observed for Cr-MCM-41, followed by Ga, Ni, V, Fe, Mn, and Co. Cr-MCM-41 catalysts showed yields above 15% with a high selectivity above 90% for propene production. The study also found that Cr-MCM-41 catalysts prepared by the template-ion exchange (TIE) method showed similar catalytic behaviors to those prepared by the DHT method. Changes in chromium loading and support properties influenced the catalytic performance, with Cr-MCM-41 maintaining its high activity across a range of Si/Cr ratios. The literature indicates that the evolution of chromium species plays a crucial role in the catalytic activity, with reduced Cr3+O6 octahedra being reoxidized by CO2 to regenerate Cr6+O4 tetrahedra, thus facilitating the dehydrogenation process.
