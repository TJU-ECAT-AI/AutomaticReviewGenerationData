<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP involved assessing how effectively they converted CO2 to oxalic dihydrogen phosphate (ODHP). The factors that influenced their catalytic performance were notably the transformation of chromium species in supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts, particularly focusing on how these species evolved with changes in loading and support properties.
