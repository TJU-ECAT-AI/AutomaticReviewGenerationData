[1] "Three-dimensional, mesoporous-cage-type, GaSBA-1 materials with different nSi/nGa ratios have been successfully prepared for the first time by using a low hydrochloric acid to silicon (nHCl/nSi) molar ratio in the synthesis gel by templating with cetyltriethylammonium bromide as the structure-directing agent in a highly acidic medium."
[2] "The obtained materials have been unambiguously characterized in detail by several sophisticated techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, elemental mapping, and 29Si magic-angle-spinning NMR spectroscopy."
[3] "The specific surface area and the specific pore volume of the GaSBA-1 materials are much higher than those of the SBA-1 silica, which are very important for the catalytic applications."
[4] "Among the catalysts examined, GaSBA-1(17), in which the number in the parenthesis denotes the nSi/nGa ratio, showed remarkable activity with a high conversion of phenol and selectivity to 4-tert-butylphenol; it was found to be superior over other mesoporous catalysts used in the study."
[5] "All the samples display typical typeIV curve, with a sharp capillary condensation step and do not show any hysteresis loops, which is a characteristic of capillary condensation in three-dimensional materials with a small-cage-type porous structure."
[6] "The morphology of the GaSBA-1 materials with different Ga content is presented in Figure6. A consistent increase in the size of the GSBA-1 particle with increasing the Ga content is clearly observed."
[7] "The catalytic activity of tert-butylation of phenol as a function of Ga content for GaSBA-1 at different reaction temperatures, with a WHSV of 5.1h1 and an nTBA/nphenol ratio of three is shown in Figure10."
[8] "It has been found that GaSBA-1(17) registered the highest phenol conversion of 84% with the selectivity to 4-TBP of 72%, which were higher than those over FeSBA-1 catalysts studied in the system."

The literature describes the successful preparation of three-dimensional, mesoporous-cage-type GaSBA-1 materials with different nSi/nGa ratios through a templating process in a highly acidic medium. These materials show enhanced specific surface area and pore volume compared to SBA-1 silica, making them suitable for catalytic applications. GaSBA-1(17) catalysts exhibited remarkable activity in the tert-butylation of phenol with high conversion and selectivity for 4-tert-butylphenol. The materials' morphology increases consistently with the Ga content, and the catalytic activity for the tert-butylation of phenol was found to be highest for GaSBA-1(17), surpassing other mesoporous catalysts like FeSBA-1.

The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP involved assessing how effectively they converted CO2 to oxalic dihydrogen phosphate (ODHP). The factors that influenced their catalytic performance were notably the transformation of chromium species in supported chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts, particularly focusing on how these species evolved with changes in loading and support properties.
