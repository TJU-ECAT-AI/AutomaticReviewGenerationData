[1] "Three-dimensional, mesoporous-cage-type, GaSBA-1 materials with different nSi/nGa ratios have been successfully prepared for the first time by using a low hydrochloric acid to silicon (nHCl/nSi) molar ratio in the synthesis gel by templating with cetyltriethylammonium bromide as the structure-directing agent in a highly acidic medium."
[2] "They show remarkable activity with a high conversion and selectivity in the tert-butylation of phenol."
[3] "In addition, the specific surface area and the specific pore volume of the GaSBA-1 materials are much higher than those of the SBA-1 silica, which are very important for the catalytic applications."
[4] "Among the catalysts examined, GaSBA-1(17), in which the number in the parenthesis denotes the nSi/nGa ratio, showed remarkable activity with a high conversion of phenol and selectivity to 4-tert-butylphenol; it was found to be superior over other mesoporous catalysts used in the study."
[5] "The GaSBA-1 catalysts are found to be superior over other catalysts such as AlMCM-41, FeSBA-1, FeAl-MCM-41, and FeMCM-41 in the above-mentioned reaction."

The GaSBA-1 catalysts, with different nSi/nGa ratios, have been successfully prepared and exhibit remarkable activity in the tert-butylation of phenol, showing high conversion and selectivity. The specific surface area and pore volume of these catalysts are notably higher than those of the SBA-1 silica, which is crucial for their catalytic applications. Among the examined catalysts, GaSBA-1(17) demonstrated superior activity, providing a high conversion of phenol and excellent selectivity towards 4-tert-butylphenol. This catalyst was found to outperform other mesoporous catalysts, including AlMCM-41, FeSBA-1, FeAl-MCM-41, and FeMCM-41, in the studied reaction.
