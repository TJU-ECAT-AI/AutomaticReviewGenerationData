[1] "Three-dimensional, mesoporous-cage-type, GaSBA-1 materials with different nSi/nGa ratios have been successfully prepared for the first time by using a low hydrochloric acid to silicon (nHCl/nSi) molar ratio in the synthesis gel by templating with cetyltriethylammonium bromide as the structure-directing agent in a highly acidic medium."
[2] "The obtained materials have been unambiguously characterized in detail by several sophisticated techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), N2 adsorption, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, elemental mapping, and 29Si magic-angle-spinning NMR spectroscopy."
[3] "The specific surface area and the specific pore volume of the GaSBA-1 materials are much higher than those of the SBA-1 silica, which are very important for the catalytic applications."
[4] "Among the catalysts examined, GaSBA-1(17), in which the number in the parenthesis denotes the nSi/nGa ratio, showed remarkable activity with a high conversion of phenol and selectivity to 4-tert-butylphenol; it was found to be superior over other mesoporous catalysts used in the study."
[5] "All the samples display typical typeIV curve, with a sharp capillary condensation step and do not show any hysteresis loops, which is a characteristic of capillary condensation in three-dimensional materials with a small-cage-type porous structure."
[6] "The morphology of the GaSBA-1 materials with different Ga content is presented in Figure6. A consistent increase in the size of the GSBA-1 particle with increasing the Ga content is clearly observed."
[7] "The catalytic activity of tert-butylation of phenol as a function of Ga content for GaSBA-1 at different reaction temperatures, with a WHSV of 5.1h1 and an nTBA/nphenol ratio of three is shown in Figure10."
[8] "It has been found that GaSBA-1(17) registered the highest phenol conversion of 84% with the selectivity to 4-TBP of 72%, which were higher than those over FeSBA-1 catalysts studied in the system."

The literature describes the successful preparation of three-dimensional, mesoporous-cage-type GaSBA-1 materials with different nSi/nGa ratios through a templating process in a highly acidic medium. These materials show enhanced specific surface area and pore volume compared to SBA-1 silica, making them suitable for catalytic applications. GaSBA-1(17) catalysts exhibited remarkable activity in the tert-butylation of phenol with high conversion and selectivity for 4-tert-butylphenol. The materials' morphology increases consistently with the Ga content, and the catalytic activity for the tert-butylation of phenol was found to be highest for GaSBA-1(17), surpassing other mesoporous catalysts like FeSBA-1.

文献描述了通过在强酸性介质中使用结构导向剂的模板化过程，成功制备了具有不同nSi/nGa比的三维、介孔笼型GaSBA-1材料。这些材料的特定表面面积和孔体积与SBA-1硅酸相比更高，适合用于催化应用。GaSBA-1(17)催化剂在苯酚异丁基化反应中表现出高转化率和4-异丁基苯酚选择性。材料的形态随着Ga含量的增加而一致地增大，并且在不同的反应温度下对Ga含量进行的催化活性研究表明，GaSBA-1(17)的活性最高，超过了系统中研究的其他介孔催化剂，如FeSBA-1。
