[1] "The synthesis conditions and the elemental composition of the calcined GaSBA-1 samples are given in Table1. It can be seen that the nSi/nGa ratio of the calcined GaSBA-1 samples decreases with increasing the addition of Ga source in the synthesis mixture."
[2] "The specific surface area and specific pore volume systematically decrease with increasing the Ga content."
[3] "The potential of the Ga-containing mesoporous materials for catalytic applications has been rarely reported in the literatures."
[4] "Among the catalysts examined, GaSBA-1(17), in which the number in the parenthesis denotes the nSi/nGa ratio, showed remarkable activity with a high conversion of phenol and selectivity to 4-tert-butylphenol."

The study investigates the preparation and catalytic performance of three-dimensional mesoporous gallosilicates, specifically GaSBA-1 materials, with varying nSi/nGa ratios. These materials are synthesized under acidic conditions using cetyltriethylammonium bromide as a structure-directing agent. The research highlights the materials' ability to retain their three-dimensional, cage-type porous structure even after incorporating gallium. The specific surface area and pore volume of the GaSBA-1 materials increase upon gallium incorporation. The catalysts exhibit remarkable activity in the tert-butylation of phenol, with GaSBA-1(17) showing the highest conversion of phenol and selectivity to 4-tert-butylphenol.

研究考察了不同nSi/nGa比例的三维介孔硅酸盐（GaSBA-1）材料的制备及其催化性能。这些材料在酸性条件下通过使用十六烷基三乙基铵溴化物作为结构导向剂合成。研究表明，即使在硅酸盐框架中掺入镓后，材料仍能保留其三维、笼型的多孔结构。GaSBA-1材料的比表面积和孔体积随镓含量的增加而增加。催化剂在对苯酚的叔丁基化反应中表现出良好的活性，其中GaSBA-1(17)显示出最高的苯酚转化率和4-叔丁基苯酚选择性。
