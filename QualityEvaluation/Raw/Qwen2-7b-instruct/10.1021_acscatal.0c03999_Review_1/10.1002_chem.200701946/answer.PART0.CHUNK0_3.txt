[1] "Three-dimensional, mesoporous-cage-type, GaSBA-1 materials with different nSi/nGa ratios have been successfully prepared for the first time by using a low hydrochloric acid to silicon (nHCl/nSi) molar ratio in the synthesis gel by templating with cetyltriethylammonium bromide as the structure-directing agent in a highly acidic medium."
[2] "XRD and nitrogen adsorption results reveal that the structures of the GaSBA-1 materials resemble that of SBA-1, which possesses a cubic, three-dimensional, cage-type structure with open windows."
[3] "Finally, the catalytic activity in the tert-butylation of phenol with tert-butanol as the alkylating agent has been investigated and the results are compared with those of other mesoporous catalysts such as AlMCM-41, FeMCM-41, FeAl-MCM-41, and FeSBA-1."
[4] "The specific surface area and specific pore volume of the GaSBA-1 materials are much higher than those of the SBA-1 silica, which are very important for the catalytic applications."
[5] "Among the catalysts examined, GaSBA-1(17), in which the number in the parenthesis denotes the nSi/nGa ratio, showed remarkable activity with a high conversion of phenol and selectivity to 4-tert-butylphenol; it was found to be superior over other mesoporous catalysts used in the study."
[6] "The catalytic activity of tert-butylation of phenol as a function of Ga content for GaSBA-1 at different reaction temperatures, with a WHSV of 5.1h−1 and an nTBA/nphenol ratio of three is shown in Figure10."
[7] "It has been found that GaSBA-1(17) registered the highest phenol conversion of 84% with the selectivity to 4-TBP of 72%, which were higher than those over FeSBA-1 catalysts studied in the system."
