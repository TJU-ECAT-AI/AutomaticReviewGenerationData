1. The 1.5% K-5.5% Cr-17% Mn-O/SiOn catalyst exhibits properties in methane conversion with CO2 where CO predominates in the reaction products, consistent with reaction 8.
2. The 1% La-13% Na-17% Mn-O/SiOz catalyst shows high selectivity in forming Cz-hydrocarbons in a non-steady-state regime.
3. The rate of catalyst reduction by ethane closely matches the rate of catalyst reoxidation by CO2.
4. The amount of oxygen utilized in the cyclic process on the K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz catalyst is notably less than in a similar process using oxygen as an oxidant.
5. The 2% WO3 and 5.5% CrO/SiOz catalyst demonstrates the highest conversion and C4H6 selectivity without causing coking during catalysis.
6. The kinetic equation governing butadiene accumulation in the reaction involves the rate constant k4 of the homogeneous pyrolysis of ethylene.
