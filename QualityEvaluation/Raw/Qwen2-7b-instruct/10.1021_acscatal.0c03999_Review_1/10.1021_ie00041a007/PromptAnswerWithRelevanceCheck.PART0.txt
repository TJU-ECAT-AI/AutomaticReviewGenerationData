1. The K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz catalyst shows a different property in methane conversion with CO2, where CO prevails in the reaction products, conforming to reaction 8. The process proceeds through a cyclic redox mechanism, distinct from the process on Ca-Mn-O/Al2O3 catalysts.

2. The 1% La-13% Na-17% Mn-O/SiOz catalyst is highly selective in Cz-hydrocarbon formation in a non-steady-state regime. Almost 100% of Cz-hydrocarbons are formed after CO2 pretreatment and subsequent CH4 introduction. No CO is formed after CO2 introduction, indicating the process does not follow a cyclic redox mechanism.

3. The rate of catalyst reduction by ethane is nearly equal to that of the catalyst reoxidation by CO2.

4. The K-Cr-MnO/SiOz catalyst in situ study reveals that the initial MnSO4 phase is reduced to form MnO.
