1. The K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz catalyst shows a different property in methane conversion with CO2, where CO prevails in the reaction products, conforming to reaction 8. The process proceeds through a cyclic redox mechanism, distinct from the process on Ca-Mn-O/Al2O3 catalysts. The oxygen amount consumed in the K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz catalyst is 8 times less than in a similar process with oxygen as an oxidant.

2. The 1% La-13% Na-17% Mn-O/SiOz catalyst is highly selective in Cz-hydrocarbon formation in a non-steady-state regime. Almost 100% of Cz-hydrocarbons are formed after CO2 pretreatment and subsequent CH4 introduction. No CO is formed after CO2 introduction, indicating the process does not follow a cyclic redox mechanism.

3. The rate of catalyst reduction by ethane is nearly equal to that of the catalyst reoxidation by CO2.

4. The K-Cr-MnO/SiOz catalyst in situ study reveals that the initial MnSO4 phase is reduced to form MnO.

5. The mechanism of ethane dehydrogenation by CO2 on the Mn-Cr-O/SiOz catalyst is outlined in the provided steps, which involve multiple redox reactions.

6. Thermal dehydrogenation can occur, along with side reactions that decrease selectivity. The reaction sequence for this process is also provided.

1. K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz催化剂在甲烷与CO2的转化中显示不同的特性，CO成为主要产物，符合反应8。该过程通过循环氧化还原机制进行，与Ca-Mn-O/Al2O3催化剂的机制不同。K-Cr-Mn-O/SiOz催化剂消耗的氧量是使用氧气作为氧化剂时的8倍。

2. 1% La-13% Na-17% Mn-O/SiOz催化剂在非稳态条件下对Cz-烃的选择性非常高。在CO2预处理和随后的CH4引入后，几乎可以完全形成Cz-烃。在引入CO2后不生成CO，表明该过程不遵循循环氧化还原机制。

3. 催化剂由乙烷还原的速度几乎等于其由CO2重新氧化的速度。

4. 在位研究发现，K-Cr-MnO/SiOz催化剂的初始MnSO4相被还原为MnO。

5. 乙烷通过CO2在Mn-Cr-O/SiOz催化剂上的脱氢机制概述了提供的步骤，涉及到多个氧化还原反应。

6. 可以发生热脱氢作用，同时伴有降低选择性的副反应。此过程的反应序列也提供。
