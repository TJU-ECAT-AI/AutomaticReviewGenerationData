The study focuses on how the timing of chromium addition in the sol-gel process affects the performance of chromium-doped mesoporous silica spheres as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. It reveals that adding chromium at different stages during the sol-gel process significantly impacts the catalyst's activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The performance of Cr2O3 catalysts with various chromium loadings is distinct, with the ideal Cr loading depending on the support properties. The transformation of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalysts plays a crucial role in achieving high activity and selectivity in CO2-ODHP.
