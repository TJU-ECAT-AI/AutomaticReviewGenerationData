The scientific literature examines how different metal oxide catalysts, with a focus on chromium-doped mesoporous silica spheres, perform in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) process. The study particularly analyzes the impact of chromium addition timing during the sol-gel process on the catalyst's activity and selectivity. It identifies several critical factors affecting the catalyst's performance, including the development of chromium species within supported chromium oxide catalysts, which is influenced by both the loading amount and the properties of the supporting material.
