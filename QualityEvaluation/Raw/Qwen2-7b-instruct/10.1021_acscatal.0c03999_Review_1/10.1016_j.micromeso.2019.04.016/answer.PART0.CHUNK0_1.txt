The scientific literature discusses how the addition time of chromium in the sol-gel process affects the catalytic performance of chromium oxide catalysts, particularly in the context of propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2. The study reveals that the performance of the Cr2O3 catalyst is significantly impacted by the timing of chromium addition. Moreover, the evolution of chromium species within the supported Cr2O3 catalyst is contingent upon the loading and support properties.
