The study focused on synthesizing Cr-doped mesoporous silica spheres for propane dehydrogenation in CO2 presence. The effect of Cr adding time during the sol-gel process was studied to understand its impact on catalytic performance. Various metal oxide catalysts were compared based on their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP, and the key factors affecting their performance were identified. These factors included the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts, which was influenced by the catalyst loading and support properties.
