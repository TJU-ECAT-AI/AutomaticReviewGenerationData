[1] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers for the propane ODH reaction is not due to the presence of a new phase, a change in the strength of the redox centers, or a change in the exposed alumina sites."
[2] "The secondary surface metal oxide additives are functioning as noninteracting modifiers."
[3] "The secondary surface metal oxide additives behave as noninteracting additives because they do not significantly alter the molecular structure of the surface VOx species of the supported V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts."
[4] "The secondary surface metal oxide additives were relatively inert for methanol ODH under the chosen reaction conditions, and did not perturb the redox activity of the alumina-supported vanadia sites."
[5] "However, during propane ODH to propylene, a significant promotional effect was seen due to the presence of the secondary surface metal oxide additives."

1. The promotional effect of the secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction is not attributed to the creation of a new phase, alterations in the redox center strength, or changes in the exposed alumina sites.

2. The secondary metal oxide additives are operating as noninteracting substances.

3. The secondary metal oxide additives are functioning as noninteracting modifiers that do not significantly change the molecular structure of the surface VOx species on the supported V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts.

4. The secondary metal oxide additives remained relatively inactive during the methanol ODH process under the selected conditions and did not disrupt the redox activity of the alumina-supported vanadia sites.

5. Nevertheless, a notable promotional impact was observed during the propane ODH to propylene reaction due to the presence of the secondary surface metal oxide additives.

1. 二次组VI金属氧化物修饰剂促进丙烷氧化脱氢反应的效果，并非源自新相的存在、还原中心强度的变化或暴露的氧化铝表面积的变化。

2. 这些二次金属氧化物添加剂正在作为非相互作用的添加剂运行。

3. 这些二次金属氧化物添加剂在支持的V2O5/Al2O3催化剂上以不显着改变表面VOx物种的分子结构的方式运作。

4. 在选择的条件下，这些二次金属氧化物添加剂在甲醇氧化脱氢过程中相对无活性，并未干扰氧化铝支持的范德瓦催化剂的还原性活动。

5. 然而，在丙烷到丙烯的氧化脱氢反应中，由于存在二次表面金属氧化物添加剂，观察到了明显的促进效果。
