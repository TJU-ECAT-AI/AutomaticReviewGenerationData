[1] "The secondary surface metal oxide additives behaved as noninteracting additives that did not significantly alter the molecular structure of the surface VOx species."
[2] "However, during propane ODH to propylene, a significant promotional effect was seen due to the presence of the secondary surface metal oxide additives."
[3] "It appears that the relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene."

1. The secondary surface metal oxide additives did not significantly alter the molecular structure of the surface VOx species, behaving as noninteracting additives.
2. The presence of secondary surface metal oxide additives led to a significant promotional effect during the propane ODH to propylene reaction.
3. The relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state, supplying the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene.

1. 次级表面金属氧化物添加剂没有显著改变表面VOx物种的分子结构，表现为非相互作用的添加剂。
2. 在丙烷脱氢生成丙烯反应中，次级表面金属氧化物添加剂的存在产生了显著的促进效应。
3. 相对惰性的次级表面金属氧化物添加剂（MoOx和WOx）弱吸附丙烷在前体状态，为丙烷活化生成丙烯提供催化活性的VOx位点。
