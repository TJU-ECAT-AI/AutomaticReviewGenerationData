[1] "The promotional effect of the secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers for the propane ODH reaction is not due to the presence of a new phase, a change in the strength of the redox centers, or a change in the exposed alumina sites."
[2] "The secondary group VI surface metal oxide modifiers behave as noninteracting additives because they do not significantly alter the molecular structure of the surface VOx species of the supported V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts."
[3] "The secondary surface metal oxide additives were relatively inert for methanol ODH under the chosen reaction conditions, and did not perturb the redox activity of the alumina-supported vanadia sites."
[4] "However, during propane ODH to propylene, a significant promotional effect was seen due to the presence of the secondary surface metal oxide additives."
[5] "It appears that the relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene."
[6] "Unlike the relatively inert surface WOx and MoOx modifiers, the surface CrOx modifier has greater intrinsic activity for propane activation than the surface VOx sites."

1. The promotional effect of secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers on the propane ODH reaction is not attributed to the creation of a new phase, changes in redox center strength, or alterations in exposed alumina sites.
2. Secondary group VI metal oxide modifiers act as non-interacting additives, leaving the molecular structure of surface VOx species unchanged on supported V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts.
3. Secondary metal oxide additives showed minimal impact on the redox activity of alumina-supported vanadia sites during methanol ODH under selected conditions.
4. A notable promotional effect emerged during propane ODH to propylene, attributed to the presence of secondary surface metal oxide additives.
5. Relatively inert secondary metal oxide additives, such as MoOx and WOx, facilitate weak propane adsorption, supplying the catalytically active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene.
6. The surface CrOx modifier, unlike inert MoOx and WOx, exhibits greater intrinsic activity for propane activation compared to surface VOx sites.

1. 二次组VI金属氧化物修饰剂对丙烷脱氢反应的促进作用并非归因于新相的存在、还原中心强度的变化或暴露的氧化铝位点的改变。
2. 二次组VI金属氧化物修饰剂作为非相互作用添加剂，没有显著改变支持的V2O5/Al2O3催化剂表面VOx物种的分子结构。
3. 在选择条件下，二次金属氧化物添加剂对甲醇脱氢的红氧化性活性影响很小，没有扰乱氧化铝支持的钒化物位点的红氧化性活性。
4. 在丙烷脱氢到丙烯过程中，由于二次表面金属氧化物添加剂的存在，观察到了明显的促进效果。
5. 相对惰性的二次金属氧化物添加剂，如MoOx和WOx，能够弱吸附丙烷，提供催化活性的VOx位点进行丙烷活化至丙烯。
6. 表面CrOx修饰剂相比表面VOx位点，具有更大的内在活性，用于丙烷活化，不同于惰性的MoOx和WOx修饰剂。
