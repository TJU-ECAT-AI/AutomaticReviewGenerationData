[1] "Supported vanadiaalumina catalysts were modified with secondary group VI (Cr, Mo, and W) metal oxide additives."
[2] "Raman spectroscopy revealed that the metal oxide additives were present as surface MOx species and that they did not form crystalline CrVO, MoVO, or WVO mixed-oxide phases."
[3] "Ra- man spectroscopy and H2-TPR studies also demonstrated that the secondary surface metal oxides behaved as noninteracting additives that did not significantly alter the molecular structure of the surface VOx species."
[4] "The secondary surface metal oxide additives were relatively inert for methanol ODH under the chosen reaction conditions, and did not perturb the redox activity of the alumina-supported vanadia sites."
[5] "However, during propane ODH to propylene, a significant promotional effect was seen due to the presence of the secondary surface metal oxide additives."
[6] "The promotional effect is reflected in an enhanced kinetic pre-exponential factor associated with the propane equilibrium adsorption constant."
[7] "It appears that the relatively inert secondary surface metal oxide additives (MoOx and WOx) are able to weakly adsorb propane in a precursor state that supplies the catalytic active VOx sites for propane activation to propylene."

The study discusses the modification of supported vanadiaalumina catalysts with secondary group VI metal oxide additives (Cr, Mo, and W). Raman spectroscopy and H2-TPR studies indicate that these additives are present as surface MOx species, forming noncrystalline structures. They do not significantly alter the molecular structure of the surface VOx species and are inert for methanol ODH, maintaining the redox activity of the alumina-supported vanadia sites. However, they show a promotional effect on propane ODH to propylene, enhancing the kinetic pre-exponential factor associated with the propane equilibrium adsorption constant. This allows the weakly adsorbed propane to supply the catalytic active VOx sites for activation to propylene.

该研究讨论了在支持的范德瓦尔斯氧化铝催化剂上添加二次组VI金属氧化物添加剂（Cr、Mo和W）。拉曼光谱和H2-TPR研究表明，这些添加剂以表面MOx物种形式存在，形成非晶结构。它们不会显著改变表面VOx物种的分子结构，并且对于甲醇氧化作用是惰性的，保持了氧化铝支持的范德瓦尔斯位点的还原活性。然而，在丙烷氧化合氢化作用到丙烯中，由于这些表面金属氧化物添加剂的存在，观察到了明显的促进效果。这种效果体现在与丙烷平衡吸附常数相关的动力学预指数因子的增强上。这使得弱吸附的丙烷能够供应催化活性的VOx位点进行丙烷激活到丙烯。
