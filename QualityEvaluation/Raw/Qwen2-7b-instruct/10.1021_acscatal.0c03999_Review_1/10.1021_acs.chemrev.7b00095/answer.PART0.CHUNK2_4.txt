[1] "Several studies report on the Claus reaction between H2S and air on composites of metal (hydr)oxide and GO, (312-323) with breakthrough H2S capacities as high as 150 mg/g of adsorbent at 1000 ppm H2S in air."
[2] "The presence of moisture proved to enhance the adsorption capacity since only one amine group is needed per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, versus two in its absence."
[3] "Efforts toward reducing the regeneration time will increase the productivity of these sorbents."
[4] "The structure of the mesoporous molecular sieves influences the kinetic capacity of the supported PEI sorbents; large pore size and three-dimensional channel structure favor higher breakthrough capacity."
[5] "Polymer chains are trapped in a frozen state at T < Tg, but T > Tg allows for significant motion of the chains. Glassy polymers offer size-selective separation by virtue of differential diffusivity; in contrast, rubbery polymers suffer reduced size selectivity from increased elasticity of the polymer chains."
[6] "This temperature of 30 C limits the H2S content in the overhead stream to about 10%."

1. The Claus reaction between H2S and air on composites of metal (hydr)oxide and GO has breakthrough H2S capacities as high as 150 mg/g of adsorbent at 1000 ppm H2S in air.
2. The presence of moisture enhances the adsorption capacity, requiring only one amine group per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, compared to two in its absence.
3. Reducing the regeneration time increases the productivity of sorbents.
4. The structure of mesoporous molecular sieves affects the kinetic capacity of supported PEI sorbents, with larger pore size and three-dimensional channel structure favoring higher breakthrough capacity.
5. Glassy polymers enable size-selective separation due to differential diffusivity, whereas rubbery polymers have reduced size selectivity due to increased elasticity of the polymer chains.
6. Operating at a temperature of 30°C limits the H2S content in the overhead stream to about 10%.

1. 催化剂复合材料上的克劳斯反应，将H2S和空气之间的反应，具有高达150mg/g吸附剂的突破H2S容量，在空气中1000ppm的H2S。
2. 湿度的存在提高了吸附能力，因为在湿度存在的情况下，每个H2S分子只需要一个胺基团，而没有湿度则需要两个。
3. 减少再生时间可以提高吸附剂的生产力。
4. 纳米多孔分子筛的结构影响支持的PEI吸附剂的动态容量；较大的孔径和三维通道结构有利于更高的突破容量。
5. 玻璃态聚合物通过差异扩散性实现尺寸选择性分离，相比之下，橡胶态聚合物由于聚合链的弹性增加而导致尺寸选择性降低。
6. 在30°C下操作限制了顶出流中的H2S含量约为10%。
