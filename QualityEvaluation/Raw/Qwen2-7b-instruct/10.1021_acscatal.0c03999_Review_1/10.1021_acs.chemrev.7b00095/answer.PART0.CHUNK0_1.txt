The document provides a comprehensive overview of various metal oxide catalysts' activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by several key factors, including the loading of chromium and the properties of the support. Rodriguez et al.'s study on adsorption of H2S on metal oxide surfaces using synchrotron-based high-resolution photoemission reveals that the reactivity of an oxide towards S-containing molecules depends on its band gap. Chromium trioxide (Cr3O4) interacts strongly with H2S. Numerous studies have explored desulfurization using different morphologies of zinc oxide (ZnO). However, comparing studies is challenging due to differences in conditions such as gas velocity, reactor volume, feed composition, and definitions of breakthrough concentration. Data for these studies are compiled in Table 5.

文档提供了各种金属氧化物催化剂对CO2-ODHP的活性和选择性的全面概述。在支持的Cr2O3催化剂中，铬物种的演变受多种关键因素的影响，包括铬的负载量和支持物的性质。Rodriguez等人通过同步辐射高分辨率光谱研究了金属氧化物表面H2S的吸附，发现氧化物对含硫分子的反应性与其带隙有关。Cr3O4与H2S强烈相互作用。许多研究已经探索了使用不同形态的锌氧化物进行脱硫。然而，在比较研究时存在挑战，因为条件不同，如气流速度、反应器体积、进料组成以及突破浓度的定义。这些研究的数据汇总在表5中。
