[1] "The breakthrough capacities mentioned by those authors are not in accord with the breakthrough times they report; using the details of the experimental setup, we calculated new breakthrough capacities which are reported in Table 9."
[2] "The ZnO/SiO2 system showed much higher absolute breakthrough capacities as well as percentage Zn utilization compared to their unsupported commercial counterparts from BASF and Sud-Chemie."
[3] "In a subsequent study, the authors used this system for studying a multi-cycle pressure swing adsorption setup."
[4] "In a follow-up work, the authors synthesized SBA-15 as a high specific surface area TEA carrier and reported that the amount of H2S adsorbed on the TEA-modified SBA-15 is 1.85 times more than that on the TEA-modified silica gel."
