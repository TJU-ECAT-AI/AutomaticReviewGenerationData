[1] "Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering."
[2] "Fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorption-regeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16."
[3] "It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide."
[4] "Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between."
[5] "This brings to light the importance of MOF framework topology in addition to the choice of the metallic cluster and the organic ligands, further iterating the importance of powerful screening of adsorbents using existing and new computational techniques that capture these subtle differences."
[6] "The breakthrough capacity increased by 40% when the adsorption temperature was raised from 30 to 80 C."
[7] "The reason for decreasing saturation loadings for CO2 with decreasing temperatures (0, 25, and 50 C) was not explained by the authors."
[8] "This system showed much higher absolute breakthrough capacities as well as percentage Zn utilization compared to their unsupported commercial counterparts from BASF and Sud-Chemie."
[9] "In a subsequent study, they found higher metal utilization compared to undoped ZnO; however, no significant preference was observed for Fe or Mn."
