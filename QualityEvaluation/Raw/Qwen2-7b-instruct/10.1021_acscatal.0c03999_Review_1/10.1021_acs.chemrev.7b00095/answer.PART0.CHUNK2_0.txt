1. Polymeric membranes with glassy structures offer size-selective separation, while rubbery polymers have reduced size selectivity due to increased elasticity of the polymer chains.
2. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity for H2S, requiring only one amine group per H2S molecule, unlike the requirement for two amine groups in its absence.
3. Linear PEI was dispersed inside the meso-channels of a SBA-15 framework, enabling interaction with silanol groups on SBA-15.
4. Process optimization in materials selection for supported amines can help identify optimal sorbents, similar to the discovery of novel zeolites for natural gas purification.
5. The structure of mesoporous molecular sieves impacts the kinetic capacity of PEI sorbents; larger pores and three-dimensional channels enhance breakthrough capacity.
6. Developed sorbents have a high breakthrough capacity of 0.79 mmol/g and a saturation capacity of 3.02 mmol/g at 22°C, using 4000 ppm H2S and 20% H2 in bulk N2.
7. Moisture enhances adsorption capacity for H2S, needing only one amine group per H2S molecule in the presence of moisture, unlike the requirement for two amine groups in its absence.
8. The affinity of PEI for H2S compared to TEA might be due to higher basicity of PEI, possibly influenced by its higher swelling compared to TEA.
9. Reducing regeneration time will increase the productivity of developed sorbents.
10. Previous studies did not explore H2S adsorption in the presence of CO2, as CO2 is significantly more acidic than H2S.

1. 玻璃态聚合物膜通过差异扩散性提供尺寸选择性分离，而橡胶状聚合物由于聚合链的弹性增加导致尺寸选择性降低。
2. 湿度增强了吸附能力，因为仅需要一个胺基团来吸附每个H2S分子，在有湿度的情况下，相比之下，在无湿度的情况下需要两个胺基团。
3. 线性PEI在SBA-15微孔通道中分散，允许PEI中的胺基与SBA-15上的硅醇基团相互作用。
4. 在材料选择优化过程中，支持胺类物质的处理可以帮助发现最佳吸附剂，类似于新型沸石在天然气净化领域的发现。
5. 多孔分子筛的结构影响PEI吸附剂的动能容量；较大的孔径和三维通道结构有利于更高的穿透容量。
6. 开发的吸附剂在22°C下具有高达0.79 mmol/g的穿透容量和3.02 mmol/g的饱和容量，使用4000 ppm H2S和20% H2在大量N2中。
7. 湿度增强了H2S的吸附能力，仅需要一个胺基团来吸附每个H2S分子，在有湿度的情况下，相比之下，在无湿度的情况下需要两个胺基团。
8. PEI对H2S的亲和力可能归因于其较高的基本性，这可能与PEI的较高膨胀相比TEA而言有关。
9. 减少再生时间将提高开发吸附剂的生产力。
10. 目前的研究未涉及CO2存在下的H2S吸附，因为CO2相对于H2S更为酸性。
