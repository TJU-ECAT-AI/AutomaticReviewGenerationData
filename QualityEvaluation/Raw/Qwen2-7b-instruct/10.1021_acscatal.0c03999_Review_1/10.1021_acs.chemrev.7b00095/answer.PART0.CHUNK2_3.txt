<p>Ma et al. have made significant progress by finding an exceptional dependence of these sorbents on temperature for CO2 and H2S competitive sorption and developing an innovative sorption process. (300) These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C.</p>
<p>Yoosuk and co-workers carried out similar two-stage studies for PEI loaded on low-cost fumed silica (fSi) and also investigated regeneration studies over multiple cycles. (301) Although the authors observed high breakthrough capacities for both CO2 and H2S for pure-component adsorption at 80 and 30 C, respectively, in the mixture adsorption with two-column configuration, the working capacity of CO2 was enhanced from 2.2 to about 3.5 mmol/g, while that of H2S decreased from the expected 1.2 to about 0.05 mmol/g.</p>

1. The PEI/SBA-15 sorbents demonstrate exceptional CO2 loading capacity at 75°C, achieving 3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm, but exhibit higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22°C due to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S. 

2. Yoosuk and colleagues conducted two-stage studies with PEI loaded on low-cost fumed silica (fSi). For pure-component adsorption, CO2 had a working capacity of 2.2 mmol/g at 80°C, while H2S had a capacity of 1.2 mmol/g at 30°C. In a mixture adsorption process with two columns, the CO2 capacity increased to around 3.5 mmol/g, but the H2S capacity decreased to about 0.05 mmol/g, much lower than expected.

1. PEI/SBA-15 吸附剂在75°C时表现出极高的CO2负载能力，达到3.2 mmol/g和0.15 atm，但其在较低温度（22°C）下对H2S的穿透容量较高，这是由于H2S的更快质子转移反应机制。 

2. Yoosuk及其同事进行了两阶段研究，使用PEI负载在低成本气凝胶（fSi）上。对于纯组分吸附，80°C时CO2的工作容量为2.2 mmol/g，而30°C时H2S的容量为1.2 mmol/g。在两个柱子的混合吸附过程中，CO2容量增加到大约3.5 mmol/g，但H2S容量降低至约0.05 mmol/g，远低于预期。
