[1] "Several DFT studies on H2S reaction with oxides of Zn, Fe, Ce, Ti, Mn, V, Cu, Co, and Mg have been carried out in the past decade."
[2] "While these studies provide some details of possible reaction mechanisms for each metal oxide, a comparative study of different pure and mixed oxides for adsorption and regeneration from first-principles calculations, at the same level of theory, can provide insights into optimal metal oxide selection."
[3] "In fact, there are several reports exploring desulfurization using different ZnO morphologies."
[4] "While it is hard to draw a head-to-head comparison between independent studies due to different gas velocities, reactor volume, feed compositions, and definitions of breakthrough concentration, data for these are compiled in Table 5."

In comparing the activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP, the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties is influenced by multiple key factors. These factors include the surface area, pore structure, and acidity of the support, as well as the specific loading of chromium. Chromium species tend to evolve from more oxidized forms to reduced forms under reaction conditions, affecting the overall catalytic activity and selectivity. Higher loading of chromium can lead to more active sites but may also cause aggregation and loss of accessibility, impacting the efficiency of CO2-ODHP. The support material plays a crucial role in controlling the dispersion of chromium species and modulating the reaction pathways, thereby influencing the catalyst's performance. Understanding these interactions requires detailed characterization of both the catalyst and the products, as well as kinetic studies to elucidate the reaction mechanisms.

在比较用于CO2-ODHP的各种金属氧化物催化剂的活性和选择性时，支持Cr2O3催化剂中铬物种的演变作为负载和支持性质的函数，受到多个关键因素的影响。这些因素包括支持物的表面积、孔结构和酸性，以及铬的具体负载量。铬物种倾向于从更氧化的形式转化为还原形式，在反应条件下，这影响整体催化活性和选择性。较高的铬负载量可能导致更多的活性位点，但也可能引起聚集和可接近性的损失，从而影响CO2-ODHP的效率。支持材料在控制铬物种的分散性和调节反应途径方面起着至关重要的作用，进而影响催化剂的性能。为了深入了解这些相互作用，需要对催化剂和产物进行详细的表征，以及动力学研究来阐明反应机制。
