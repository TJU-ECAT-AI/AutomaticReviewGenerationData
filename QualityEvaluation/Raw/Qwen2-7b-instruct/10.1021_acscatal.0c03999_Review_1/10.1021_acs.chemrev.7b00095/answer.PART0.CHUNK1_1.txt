<p>Li et al. were probably the first to demonstrate the regeneration of sulfur-loaded adsorbents with minimal sintering.</p>
<p>Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S.</p>
<p>A fully regenerable capacity of 7 mg of S/g adsorbent over five adsorption-regeneration cycles was achieved for 16.6 wt% Ni loaded on SBA-16.</p>
<p>Hamon et al. carried out the first experimental study of H2S adsorption in MOFs; these included the small-pore (SP) MIL-53(AlIII, CrIII, FeIII) and MIL-47(VIV) (11 Å) and the large-pore (LP) MIL-100(Cr) and MIL-101(Cr) (25 and 30 Å cage diameter and 4.8×5.8 and 12.5×12.5 Å pore apertures, respectively).</p>
<p>It should be noted here that, for the breathing MOF (MIL-53(Cr)), isotherms were simulated for two different rigid MOF structures, representing the narrow and the large-pore regimes in the experimental adsorption isotherm.</p>
<p>Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations were carried out using force fields that were shown to yield a decent agreement with the single-component experimental adsorption isotherms and enthalpies.</p>
<p>Although MIL-68(Al) is a polymorph of MIL-53(Al) (described above), unlike the latter, the former does not seem to exhibit framework flexibility, as evidenced by its type-I adsorption isotherm.</p>
<p>Cu-BTC (or HKUST-1 or MOF-199) comprises of an intersecting three-dimensional system of large square-shaped pores (9 × 9 Å) and small tetrahedral pockets (5 Å) formed with copper as the inorganic metal and benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid (BTC), also known as trimesic acid, as the organic linker.</p>
<p>Watanabe and Sholl investigated chemisorption of several molecules, including H2S and H2O, in Cu-BTC using plane wave periodic DFT.</p>
<p>Li et al. experimentally investigated the same system by activating the material before carrying out H2S adsorption.</p>
<p>Eddaoudi et al. synthesized a series of 16 isoretucular (having the same network topology) MOFs (IRMOF-n, n = 116) based on a skeleton of Zn-based MOF-5, wherein the pore functionality and size were varied without changing the original cubic topology.</p>
<p>Theoretical investigation of H2S was performed in IRMOF-1 (or MOF-5) having 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate organic linkers; the heat of adsorption was 15 kJ/mol, much lower than that for Cu-BTC (30 kJ/mol) due to wider (11.2 Å) pores of IRMOF-1 compared to confined (5 Å) tetrahedral-shaped pockets in Cu-BTC.</p>
<p>Regeneration with pure helium at 180 C was sufficient to remove almost all of the adsorbed water, but only 40% of the adsorption capacity was restored for H2S.</p>
<p>Very recently, Belmabkhout et al. investigated In3+-, Fe3+-, Ga3+-, and Al3+-based socMOFs as adsorbents and thin-film membranes for the production of high-quality hydrocarbons (CH4, C3H8 and n-C4H10, and olefins) from H2S-containing gas streams.</p>
<p>Future studies should account for factors such as moisture, regeneration for several cycles, and XRD measurements before and after each (or at least, after every few) regeneration.</p>
