[1] "Significant development has occurred in the scientific and technological improvement of polymeric membranes for sour gas sweetening."
[2] "Polymeric membranes yield ideal and mixture SH2S/CH4 values in the ranges 140190 and 3570, respectively."
[3] "These membranes demonstrate SH2S/CO2 between 3.4 and 4.5."
[4] "The presence of H2O impurities was examined by using a feed gas stream saturated with H2O vapor; no detrimental effect on the selectivities was observed, but the fluxes decreased by 4045%."
[5] "The flux nearly doubled for H2S and nearly halved for CH4, resulting in a 4-fold increase in selectivity compared to the uncharged-pore membrane."
[6] "It is intriguing that, in the development of separation processes for gas sweetening, distillation has come into the picture only in the past decade or so."
[7] "For many chemical separations, distillation has been the most straightforward and often long-lasting choice, unless an obvious better choice of separation was available."

1. Significant advancements have been made in the scientific and technological development of polymeric membranes for the sweetening of sour gases.

2. Polymeric membranes display ideal and mixture selectivities for separating H2S from CH4 in the ranges of 140 to 190 and 35 to 70, respectively.

3. These membranes exhibit selectivities for separating H2S from CO2 between 3.4 and 4.5.

4. The introduction of water vapor into the feed stream did not negatively impact the selectivities of the membranes, but it caused a decrease in fluxes by 40% to 45%.

5. The flux for H2S increased nearly twofold, while that for CH4 decreased nearly halved, leading to a fourfold increase in selectivity when compared to membranes with uncharged pores.

6. It is noteworthy that distillation has recently emerged as a technique for gas sweetening processes, despite being a well-established method for many chemical separations.

7. For many chemical separation tasks, distillation has traditionally been the most direct and enduring option, unless a more suitable separation method was readily available.

1. 在酸性气体净化领域，聚合物膜的科学和技术发展取得了显著进展。

2. 聚合物膜在将H2S从CH4中分离时的理论和混合选择性范围为140至190和35至70。

3. 这些膜在将H2S与CO2分离时的选择性在3.4至4.5之间。

4. 向进料流中引入水蒸气没有对膜的选择性产生负面影响，但导致了40%到45%的流量下降。

5. 对H2S的通量增加了近两倍，而CH4的通量减少了近一半，这导致与无电荷孔膜相比，选择性提高了四倍。

6. 令人惊讶的是，尽管是化学分离的常规方法，但在过去的十年里，蒸馏技术才开始用于天然气甜化过程。

7. 对于许多化学分离任务，蒸馏一直是最直接且持久的方法，除非有更合适的分离方法可用。
