1. MOFs with ultra-high capacity face challenges in maintaining bed stability during exothermic adsorption processes, especially in offshore natural gas sweetening applications where compactness is crucial. Adequate heat transfer mechanisms are required to manage the temperature increases associated with these high-capacity MOFs.

2. Functionalized organic ligands in MOFs can enhance selectivity towards specific gas molecules, contributing to the adsorbent's overall performance.

3. Polar impurities like water can significantly impact the adsorption efficiency and stability of MOFs, affecting their suitability for desulfurization tasks.

4. Detailed experimental data at various H2S partial pressures, particularly at higher concentrations, are essential for evaluating MOFs' applicability in treating ultra-sour gas streams. Low-concentration breakthrough data are also valuable for tail gas cleanup applications.
