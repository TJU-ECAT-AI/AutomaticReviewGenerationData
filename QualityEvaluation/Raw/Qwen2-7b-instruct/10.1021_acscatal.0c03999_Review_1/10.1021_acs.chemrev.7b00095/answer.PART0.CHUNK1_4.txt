[1] "Adsorption was carried out at 300 C using a coal syngas composition of 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S, and regeneration was carried out at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidationreduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with a short Ar purge in between."
[2] "It is unclear, however, whether H2S adsorption was carried out on the hydrogen-regenerated form of the adsorbent or on the air-regenerated form that would result in a metal oxide."
[3] "This highlights the importance of designing increasingly improved supports for metal oxides and suggests that Cu-Zn mixed oxides doped on SBA-15 may demonstrate a high capacity."
[4] "Generally, nanoparticles exhibit a tendency to grow into larger crystallites during the process of high-temperature regeneration."

1. Adsorption took place at 300 C with a coal syngas containing 23% H2, 29% CO, 8% CO2, 30% H2O, 10% He, and 10 ppm H2S. Regeneration was conducted at 550 C using a five-cycle alternating oxidation-reduction treatment of pure H2 and 10% air in Ar with an Ar purge in between. It's uncertain whether H2S adsorption occurred on the hydrogen-regenerated or air-regenerated form of the adsorbent, which might result in a metal oxide.
2. The use of improved supports for metal oxides is crucial. Cu-Zn mixed oxides doped on SBA-15 might exhibit a high capacity.
3. Nanoparticles tend to grow into larger crystallites during high-temperature regeneration processes.

1. 吸附在300 C下进行，煤合成气包含23％H2，29％CO，8％CO2，30％H2O，10％He和10 ppm H2S。再生在550 C下进行，使用纯H2和10％空气在Ar中的交替氧化还原处理，并在中间进行短时间的Ar吹扫。无法确定H2S吸附是在氢再生形式还是空气再生形式的吸附剂上进行的，这可能会导致金属氧化物。
2. 对于金属氧化物的改进支撑至关重要。Cu-Zn混合氧化物掺杂到SBA-15中可能表现出高容量。
3. 在高温再生过程中，纳米颗粒倾向于生长成更大的晶粒。
