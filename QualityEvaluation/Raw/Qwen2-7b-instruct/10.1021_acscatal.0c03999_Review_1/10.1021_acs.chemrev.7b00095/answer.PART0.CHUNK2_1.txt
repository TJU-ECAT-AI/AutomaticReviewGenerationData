<p>Ma et al. have made significant progress by finding an exceptional dependence of these sorbents on temperature for CO2 and H2S competitive sorption and developing an innovative sorption process. (300)</p>
<p>These PEI/SBA-15 sorbents show an exceptionally high CO2 loading at 75 C (3.2 mmol/g at 0.15 atm), but the lower kinetic barrier for H2S compared to CO2, which may be attributed to the faster proton-transfer reaction mechanism in the case of H2S, results in higher H2S breakthrough capacities at a lower temperature of 22 C.</p>
<p>Yoosuk and co-workers carried out similar two-stage studies for PEI loaded on low-cost fumed silica (fSi) and also investigated regeneration studies over multiple cycles. (301)</p>
<p>Although the authors observed high breakthrough capacities for both CO2 and H2S for pure-component adsorption at 80 and 30 C, respectively, in the mixture adsorption with two-column configuration, the working capacity of CO2 was enhanced from 2.2 to about 3.5 mmol/g, while that of H2S decreased from the expected 1.2 to about 0.05 mmol/g.</p>
<p>Belmabkhout et al. studied triamine-grafted (CH2CH2CH2NHCH2CH2NHCH2CH2NH2) pore-expanded mesoporous silica (TRI-PE-MCM-41) for adsorption of dry CO2, H2S, and CH4 and found a much higher affinity for CO2 and H2S compared to CH4 (see Figure 14).</p>
<p>The largest breakthrough capacity of these sorbents was 1.27 mmol/g, about 60% higher than that of PEI/SBA-15 (0.79 mmol/g) or MCM-41 (0.81 mmol/g), although the test for the former was carried out at a lower inlet H2S concentration and a higher GHSV.</p>
<p>Efforts toward reducing the regeneration time will increase the productivity of these sorbents.</p>
<p>In another study, Huang et al. prepared composites using MOF-5 and GO in the presence of glucose. (310) GO enhanced the dispersive forces in MOF-5, as demonstrated by higher H2S uptake, but beyond the optimal loading of 5.25%, GO led to collapse of the MOF crystal structure.</p>
<p>While this approach provides a route to stabilize such composite materials, performance and structural reversibility of these sorbents on regeneration need to be investigated.</p>
