"The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."
"The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
"Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."
"Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."
"CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."
"As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The study examines the impact of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane using Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts prepared via the impregnation method. The activity of Cr/SiO2 increases with higher CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 decreases with even a small amount of CO2. This suggests that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 hinders the adsorption of propane, reducing the activity of Cr/Al2O3. Both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 exhibit a redox cycle involving Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 during the dehydrogenation of propane. CO2 can oxidize some Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, leading to oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species for Cr/SiO2.

该研究探讨了二氧化碳对丙烷在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂上的脱氢作用的影响。通过浸渍法制备这两种催化剂。随着二氧化碳分压的增加，Cr/SiO2的活性提高，而Cr/Al2O3的活性则因少量二氧化碳的添加而显著降低。这表明，二氧化碳吸附在Al2O3上阻碍了丙烷的吸附，降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。无论是Cr/SiO2还是Cr/Al2O3，在脱氢过程中都表现出Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环。二氧化碳可以在反应条件下氧化部分Cr(III)物种到Cr(VI)物种，导致Cr/SiO2中的氧化脱氢作用，同时发生简单的脱氢作用于Cr(III)物种。
