The comparison of various metal oxide catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP) shows distinct differences. For Cr/SiO2, the activity increases with the increase in CO2 partial pressure, indicating that CO2 plays a beneficial role in enhancing the dehydrogenation efficiency on this type of catalyst. Conversely, the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts decreases significantly upon the addition of even a small amount of CO2, suggesting that CO2 negatively impacts the catalytic performance on this support. 

The key factors influencing their catalytic performance are related to the interaction of CO2 with the catalyst surface. Specifically, CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibits the adsorption of propane (C3H8), thus reducing the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. This inhibition is likely due to the formation of a protective layer of CO2 on the catalyst surface, which impedes the desired reaction pathway.

Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) profiles reveal that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 is crucial in the dehydrogenation process over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 catalysts. This redox cycle is essential for the efficient conversion of propane into propylene. Moreover, CO2 has the ability to oxidize some of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction conditions, which leads to a dual mechanism of dehydrogenation occurring on Cr/SiO2 catalysts. This oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr(VI) species complements the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species, potentially contributing to a higher overall yield of propylene.

In summary, the role of CO2 in CO2-ODHP is complex, with its impact varying depending on the type of catalyst (Cr/SiO2 vs. Cr/Al2O3) and the specific redox properties of chromium species. The redox cycle involving chromium oxides plays a central role in the dehydrogenation process, and CO2 can facilitate oxidative dehydrogenation in addition to simple dehydrogenation, depending on the catalyst support.

比较不同金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳辅助脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中的活性和选择性显示了明显的差异。对于Cr/SiO2，随着CO2分压的增加，其活性提高，表明CO2在增强此类催化剂的脱氢效率方面起着有益的作用。相比之下，Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性在添加少量CO2后显著降低，这表明CO2对这种支持体系的催化性能产生负面影响。

影响这些催化剂性能的关键因素是CO2与催化剂表面的相互作用。具体来说，CO2吸附在Al2O3上抑制了丙烷（C3H8）的吸附，从而降低了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。这种抑制可能是因为CO2在催化剂表面形成保护层，阻碍了所需的反应途径。

Cr K边XAFS光谱和温度程序化还原（TPR）图谱揭示了Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂中Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环对于脱氢过程至关重要。这个氧化还原循环对于高效转化丙烷为丙烯至关重要。此外，CO2具有在反应条件下将一些Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种的能力，这导致Cr/SiO2催化剂上发生氧化脱氢，补充了简单的脱氢过程，可能有助于更高的丙烯产率。

总之，CO2在CO2-ODHP中的作用复杂，其影响取决于催化剂类型（Cr/SiO2 vs. Cr/Al2O3）以及铬物种的具体氧化还原性质。铬氧化物的氧化还原循环在脱氢过程中扮演核心角色，并且CO2可以促进氧化脱氢，同时进行简单的脱氢，具体取决于催化剂支持体。
