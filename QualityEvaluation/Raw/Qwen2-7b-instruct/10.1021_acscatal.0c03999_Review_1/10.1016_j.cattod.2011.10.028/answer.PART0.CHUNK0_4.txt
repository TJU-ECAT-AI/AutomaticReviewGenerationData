[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
[2] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."
[3] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."

1. The activity of the Cr/SiO2 catalyst increases with the increase in CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst significantly decreases upon the addition of a small amount of CO2. This suggests that CO2 plays different roles on these two catalyst supports. Kinetic analysis indicates that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 hinders the adsorption of propane (C3H8) and reduces the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 is crucial for the dehydrogenation of propane over both catalysts, regardless of the support type. Additionally, CO2 can oxidize some Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction conditions.

1. Cr/SiO2催化剂在CO2分压增加时，其活性增加；而Cr/Al2O3催化剂在少量CO2添加后，活性显著降低。这表明CO2在两种催化剂支持物上的作用不同。动力学分析显示，CO2在Al2O3上吸附抑制了C3H8的吸附，并降低了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。无论支持类型如何，Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂上丙烷脱氢反应中，Cr(III)O6与Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环起着重要作用。此外，在反应条件下，CO2可以将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种。
