"The effect of CO2 on the activity for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 prepared by impregnation method was investigated."
"The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
"Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."
"Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."
"CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."
"As a result, in the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

The study investigates the impact of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over chromium-based catalysts supported on silica and alumina. It reveals that CO2 enhances the activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts when the partial pressure increases, whereas it significantly reduces the activity of Cr/Al2O3 upon adding a small amount of CO2. The kinetic analysis indicates that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibits the adsorption of propane, thereby decreasing the activity of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst. The redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation process over both types of catalysts, regardless of the support material. Moreover, CO2 can oxidize part of the Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction conditions, leading to oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species.

研究探讨了二氧化碳对丙烷在硅酸盐和铝酸盐支持的铬基催化剂上的脱氢化作用的影响。结果显示，二氧化碳增强了Cr/SiO2催化剂的活性，随着二氧化碳分压的增加；而少量二氧化碳的添加显著降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。动力学分析表明，二氧化碳吸附在Al2O3上抑制了丙烷的吸附，从而减少了Cr/Al2O3催化剂的活性。铬(III)O6与铬(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环在使用这两种催化剂时对于丙烯的脱氢化过程至关重要，无论支持材料如何。此外，二氧化碳可以在反应条件下将部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种，导致Cr(VI)物种上的丙烷氧化脱氢化，在Cr(III)物种上进行简单的脱氢化之外。
