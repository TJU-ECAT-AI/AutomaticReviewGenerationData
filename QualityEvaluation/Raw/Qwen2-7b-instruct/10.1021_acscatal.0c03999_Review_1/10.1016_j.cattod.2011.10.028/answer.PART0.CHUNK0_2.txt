[1] "The activity of Cr/SiO2 was enhanced with increasing the partial pressure of CO2, while the activity of Cr/Al2O3 was remarkably reduced by the addition of a small amount of CO2."
[2] "Kinetic analysis suggested that CO2 adsorbed on Al2O3 inhibited the adsorption of C3H8, and that CO2 reduced the activity of Cr/Al2O3."
[3] "Cr K-edge XAFS spectra and TPR profiles indicated that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 had an important role in the dehydrogenation of C3H6 over both Cr/SiO2 and Cr/Al2O3 regardless of the support."
[4] "CO2 could oxidize a part of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under the reaction condition."
[5] "In the case of Cr/SiO2, the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 over Cr(VI) species took place in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species."

1. The activity of Cr/SiO2 catalysts increased with the increase in CO2 partial pressure during the dehydrogenation of propane, whereas the activity of Cr/Al2O3 catalysts significantly decreased upon the addition of a small amount of CO2. The kinetic analysis revealed that CO2 adsorbed onto Al2O3 hindered the adsorption of propane, thereby reducing the activity of Cr/Al2O3. XAFS spectra and TPR profiles showed that the redox cycle between Cr(III)O6 and Cr(VI)O4 played a crucial role in the dehydrogenation of propane over both types of catalysts, irrespective of the support material. Moreover, CO2 could oxidize a portion of Cr(III) species to Cr(VI) species under reaction conditions, which led to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Cr(VI) species in addition to the simple dehydrogenation over Cr(III) species on Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

1. 当增加二氧化碳分压时，Cr/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢反应中的活性增加，而Cr/Al2O3催化剂在加入少量二氧化碳后活性显著降低。动力学分析表明，吸附在Al2O3上的CO2阻碍了丙烷的吸附，从而降低了Cr/Al2O3的活性。XAFS谱和TPR图谱显示，在Cr/SiO2和Cr/Al2O3催化剂上，无论支持材料如何，Cr(III)O6和Cr(VI)O4之间的氧化还原循环对丙烷脱氢起着关键作用。此外，当在反应条件下存在CO2时，它可以将一部分Cr(III)物种氧化为Cr(VI)物种，这导致了Cr/SiO2催化剂上丙烷通过Cr(VI)物种的氧化脱氢反应，除了Cr(III)物种的简单脱氢反应之外。
