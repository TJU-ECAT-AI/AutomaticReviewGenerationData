[1] "However, reduction of the active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction is known to lead to severe deactivation."
[2] "With an Ni promoter on the CrOx/silica catalyst, CO2 is a more effective oxidant and reduced Cr2+ states are regenerated to active Cr3+ states."
[3] "The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst yields propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[4] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads)."
[5] "Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[6] "The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the catalytic stability of propylene in the ODHP reaction."
[7] "Cr6+ states in CrOx reduce immediately to Cr3+ on interaction with propane, which acts as a precursor for active sites."
[8] "The oxidizing ability of CO2 was confirmed by the three-step-TPR analysis, and most of the Cr3+ state, which is the active site for the ODHP reaction, was regenerated in the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst."
[9] "This allows one to conclude that Ni has superior ability to dissociate CO2 as well as to regenerate the active site in CrOx for the ODHP reaction, which results in a stable yield of propylene."

1. The reduction of the active sites (Cr3+) during the reaction leads to severe deactivation.
2. Adding Ni as a promoter to the CrOx/silica catalyst makes CO2 a more effective oxidant, regenerating reduced Cr2+ states back to active Cr3+ states.
3. The Ni-promoted CrOx/silica catalyst effectively produces propylene in the ODHP reaction.
4. Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads).
5. The activated O*ads then regenerates the reduced CrOx.
6. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst improves the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction.
7. Cr6+ states quickly transform to Cr3+ upon interacting with propane, serving as the active site.
8. The three-step TPR analysis confirms CO2's oxidizing ability, enabling the regeneration of the majority of the Cr3+ state, which is crucial for the ODHP reaction.
9. Ni has the superior ability to dissociate CO2 and regenerate the active CrOx site for the ODHP reaction, ensuring a stable propylene yield.
