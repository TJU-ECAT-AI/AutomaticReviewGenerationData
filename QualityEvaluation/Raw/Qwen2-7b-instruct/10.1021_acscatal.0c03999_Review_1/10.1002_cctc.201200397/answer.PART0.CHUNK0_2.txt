[1] "Propylene is one of the most useful chemicals in the petrochemical industry because it can serve as a precursor for the production of valuable products such as cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene."
[2] "CrOx catalysts supported on the SBA-15 support (Cr/Si) are highly active, they represent potentially promising catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP)."
[3] "Despite their high activity, CrOx/silica catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation15 because of coke deposition and CrOx reduction and so convert the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ state into the inactive Cr2+ state."
[4] "Nakagawa etal. reported that the surface Cr remained in a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 than in its absence in the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes."
[5] "The role of the Ni added to the catalyst elucidates that Ni induces the dissociation of CO2 to CO and activated O (O*ads). Then, the generated O*ads regenerates the reduced CrOx."
[6] "The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst was determined from CHNS analysis (CHNS-932; LECO)."
[7] "UV/Vis DRS results indicate that the prepared catalysts contain both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, although Cr3+ species is dominant by α-Cr2O3."
[8] "The conversion of CO2 and propane increases linearly with the increase in the loading weight of Ni."
[9] "Importantly, Ni maintained the stable catalytic activity. Higher conversion of CO2 and stable production of propylene imply that Ni dissociates CO2 to CO and O*ads, which regenerates the reduced Cr species Cr2+ to Cr3+ through reoxidation."

1. Propylene is a valuable chemical in the petrochemical industry, serving as a precursor for products like cumene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and polypropylene.
2. Chromium oxide (CrOx) catalysts supported on SBA-15 (Cr/Si) exhibit high activity and are promising for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.
3. High activity of CrOx/silica catalysts is compromised due to rapid deactivation caused by coke deposition and CrOx reduction, converting the active Cr3+ state to inactive Cr2+.
4. CO2 has limited oxidizing ability towards reoxidizing reduced CrOx, but the presence of CO2 raises the oxidation state of surface Cr compared to its absence.
5. Nickel (Ni) promotes the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 by inducing CO2 dissociation to CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates reduced CrOx.
6. The amount of coke deposited on the catalyst is measured using CHNS analysis.
7. Prepared catalysts contain both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, with Cr3+ being dominant due to α-Cr2O3 formation.
8. The loading weight of nickel (Ni) increases the conversion of CO2 and propane linearly.
9. Nickel maintains stable catalytic activity, enabling higher CO2 conversion and stable production of propylene by dissociating CO2 to CO and generating O*ads for CrOx regeneration.
10. Ex situ XPS spectra reveal the presence of Cr2p peaks centered at 577.4 eV and 587.4 eV, corresponding to Cr2p3/2 and Cr2p1/2 components, respectively.
