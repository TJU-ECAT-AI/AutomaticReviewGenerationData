1. Chromium oxide catalysts supported on SBA-15 support exhibit high activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP). The deactivation occurs due to the reduction of active Cr3+ sites.

2. The addition of 0.5wt% nickel to the catalyst significantly improves its stability and selectivity in the ODHP reaction.

3. The regeneration of reduced CrOx by nickel is facilitated through a three-step hydrogen temperature programmed reduction analysis.
