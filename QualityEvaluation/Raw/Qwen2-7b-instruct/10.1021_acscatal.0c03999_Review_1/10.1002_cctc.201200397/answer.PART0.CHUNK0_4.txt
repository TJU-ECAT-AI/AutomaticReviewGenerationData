1. The reduction of active sites (Cr3+) during the CO2-ODHP reaction leads to severe deactivation of the catalyst.
2. Adding 0.5wt% Ni to the 10wt% Cr/Si catalyst (0.5Ni-Cr/Si) results in stable catalytic activity and high selectivity.
3. The addition of Ni facilitates the regeneration of reduced CrOx.
4. Ex situ XPS results show that Cr3+ is preserved in the Ni-promoted catalyst while easily reduced to Cr2+ in the non-promoted catalyst during the reaction.
5. The main cause of catalyst deactivation in CrOx/silica catalysts is attributed to CrOx reduction.
6. Ni promotes the dissociation of CO2 into CO and activated O (O*ads), which regenerates the reduced CrOx.
7. CO2 acts as a more effective oxidant, regenerating Cr2+ states to active Cr3+ states.
8. The Ni-promoted CrOx/SBA-15 catalyst is effective in producing propylene in the ODHP reaction.
9. Ni-induced dissociation of CO2 generates CO and activated O (O*ads), facilitating the regeneration of the reduced CrOx.
10. The Ni-promoted Cr/Si catalyst enhances the stability of propylene production in the ODHP reaction.

1. 反应中Cr3+活性位点的减少会导致催化剂严重失活。
2. 将0.5wt% Ni添加到10wt% Cr/Si催化剂（0.5Ni-Cr/Si）后，催化活性稳定且选择性高。
3. 添加Ni可以促进还原的CrOx的再生。
4. 外场XPS结果显示，Ni促进剂催化剂中的Cr3+得到维持，而非促进剂催化剂中的Cr3+容易被还原为Cr2+。
5. CrOx/silica催化剂失活的主要原因是CrOx的还原。
6. Ni促进了CO2的分解，生成CO和激活的O（O*ads），从而促进了还原的CrOx的再生。
7. CO2作为更有效的氧化剂，能够将Cr2+状态再生为活性Cr3+状态。
8. Ni促进的CrOx/SBA-15催化剂在ODHP反应中有效生成丙烯。
