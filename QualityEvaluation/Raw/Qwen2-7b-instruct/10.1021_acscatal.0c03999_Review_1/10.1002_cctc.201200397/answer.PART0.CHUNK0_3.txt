1. Nakagawa et al.'s research indicates that the surface chromium remains at a higher oxidation state in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence during the oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. CO2's limited oxidizing capability makes reoxidation of reduced CrOx challenging due to its thermodynamic stability. 
2. Ni-based catalysts are utilized in CO2 reforming reactions and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) process. Ab initio calculations reveal that the activation energy for CO2 dissociation on Ni atoms is notably less than in its absence.
3. Oxygen atoms (O*ads) generated on Ni surfaces can contribute to the reoxidation of reduced CrOx species during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (ODHP) reaction.
4. The effectiveness of Ni was assessed through three-step H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and ex situ XPS experiments.
5. The Ni-promoted catalysts were designated as #NiCr/Si, where # represents the loading weight of Ni.
6. Both 0.5Ni-Cr/Si and Cr/Si catalysts exhibited diffracted peaks corresponding to crystalline α-Cr2O3 at specific 2θ values.
7. The weight fraction of deposited coke was 12% for the Cr/Si catalyst and 16.7% for the 0.5Ni-Cr/Si catalyst, indicating a higher amount of coke deposition on the latter.

1. Nakagawa等人报告指出，在较低烷烃的氧化脱氢过程中，CO2的存在下表面铬的氧化状态高于其不存在的情况。由于CO2的热力学稳定性，它限制了还原CrOx的重新氧化能力。
2. Ni基催化剂在CO2重整反应和逆水煤气变换（RWGS）过程中有广泛应用。通过第一性原理计算发现，Ni原子上的CO2解离激活能明显低于其不存在时的激活能。
3. Ni表面上产生的氧原子（O*ads）可以在氧化脱氢丙烷与CO2（ODHP）反应中起到还原被还原的CrOx物种的作用。
4. 通过三步H2温度程序化还原（TPR）和离线XPS实验验证了Ni的效果。
5. 加入Ni的催化剂被标记为#NiCr/Si，其中#表示Ni的负载量。
6. 无论是0.5Ni-Cr/Si还是Cr/Si催化剂，都显示了对应于结晶态α-Cr2O3的特定2θ值的衍射峰。
7. Cr/Si催化剂上沉积的焦炭重量比为12%，而0.5Ni-Cr/Si催化剂上的焦炭重量比为16.7%，表明后者沉积的焦炭量更多。
