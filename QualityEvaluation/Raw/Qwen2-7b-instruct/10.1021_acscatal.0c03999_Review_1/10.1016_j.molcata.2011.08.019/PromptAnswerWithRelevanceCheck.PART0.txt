The document compares various metal oxide catalysts, focusing on chromium oxide (Cr) and gallium oxide (Ga) catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The document notes that among the investigated materials, those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective. The presence of Cr6+ species is crucial for high activity in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 (DHPCO2). The document explains that the activity and selectivity of these catalysts depend on the nature of the support, with Cr2O3/SiO2 showing a promoting effect and Cr2O3/Al2O3 showing a negative effect. Gallium oxide materials exhibit different responses to CO2, enhancing the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3/TiO2 while suppressing that of Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 catalysts. The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on catalytic activity, as it is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, making it useless as a catalyst. The document emphasizes the importance of using high surface area mesoporous materials as supports for dispersing chromium species, as they offer a more uniform pore structure compared to commercial silica. The study presents a comparative analysis of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports, including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structures, as well as two commercially available silica types. The influence of chromium loading and support properties on the surface composition and dispersion of chromium species is investigated using various physicochemical characterization techniques. Based on the characterization results, the catalytic performance in the DHPCO2 process is discussed.

本文比较了各种金属氧化物催化剂，重点关注铬氧化物（Cr）和镓氧化物（Ga）催化剂在二氧化碳辅助下丙烷脱氢为丙烯的应用。文中指出，在研究的材料中，含Cr或Ga的催化剂活性和选择性最高。Cr6+物种对于高活性在丙烷与CO2（DHPCO2）脱氢过程中的作用至关重要。文中解释了这些催化剂的活性和选择性取决于支持物的性质，Cr2O3/SiO2显示促进效果，而Cr2O3/Al2O3显示负面效应。镓氧化物材料对CO2的响应不同，Ga2O3/TiO2催化剂活性增强，而Ga2O3/Al2O3和Ga2O3/ZrO2催化剂活性受到抑制。表面层上存在的-SiO2上的-Cr2O3有负面影响，因为并非所有Cr原子都可被反应分子接触。此外，结晶态的-Cr2O3对氢和氧高度耐受，使其无法作为催化剂使用。文章强调使用具有更高表面面积的微孔材料作为支撑物分散铬物种的重要性，因为它们比商业硅胶提供更均匀的孔结构。研究呈现了在立方体（SBA-1）和六边形（SBA-15）孔结构的微孔筛以及两种商用硅胶上支持的铬氧化物的比较分析。利用各种物理化学表征技术，研究了铬负载和支持物属性对表面组成和铬分布的影响。根据表征结果，讨论了DHPCO2过程中的催化性能。
