[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
[2] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2,propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[3] "The above general description concerning Cr/SiO2 systems indicates that for obtaining a high activity,a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved."
[4] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."
[5] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
[6] "Below the monolayer coverage of silica, Cr species in the higher oxidation states,mainly as Cr6+ species in the form of mono- and polychromates,dominate."
[7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
[8] "The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
[9] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
[10] "In this work we presented a comparative study of the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structure and two commercially available silica."

1. Among the materials studied, those containing chromium (Cr) or gallium (Ga) showed the highest activity and selectivity for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP).
2. The presence of CO2 led to simultaneous dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, producing propene.
3. For achieving high activity, the dispersion of chromium species on the catalyst surface needs to be high, especially in mesoporous supports.
4. Crystalline -Cr2O3 forms on the surface, which is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, rendering it ineffective as a catalyst.
5. Chromium species exist in multiple oxidation states (3+, 5+, and 6+) on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts.
6. When the chromium content surpasses the monolayer coverage, both amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 phases form.
7. The crystalline -Cr2O3 phase, being the most thermodynamically stable, forms more readily with increased temperature and water excess.
8. The presence of -Cr2O3 on silica surfaces negatively impacts catalytic activity due to limited accessibility of Cr atoms to reactant molecules.
9. A comparative study was conducted on chromium oxide catalysts supported on various siliceous supports, including mesoporous sieves with cubic and hexagonal pore structures, and commercial silica.

1. 研究中，含Cr或Ga的材料表现出最高活性和选择性，用于CO2辅助丙烷氧化脱氢。
2. CO2的存在导致同时发生脱氢和氧化脱氢途径，产生丙烯。
3. 为了获得高活性，催化剂表面的Cr物种分散性需要很高，特别是在介孔支撑材料上。
4. 氧化Cr/silica催化剂表面存在多种氧化态（3+、5+、6+）的Cr物种。
5. 当Cr含量超过单层覆盖率时，形成非晶质和晶态-Cr2O3。
6. 随着温度升高和水过量，晶态-Cr2O3作为最热力学稳定的CrO3相更容易形成。
7. -Cr2O3在硅酸盐表面的存在对催化活性有负面影响，因为并非所有Cr原子都可被反应分子接触。
8. 对于不同硅基支撑材料上的Cr氧化物催化剂进行了比较研究，包括具有立方和六方孔结构的介孔筛以及商业硅。
