[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
[2] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:(i) In the presence of CO2,propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[3] "The above general description concerning Cr/SiO2 systems indicates that for obtaining a high activity,a high dispersion of Cr species has to be achieved."
[4] "The formation of crystalline -Cr2O3,which is the most thermodynamically stable chromium oxide phase,is accelerated by high temperature and by the excess of water."
[5] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."

1. Chromium (Cr) and Gallium (Ga)-containing materials were identified as the most active and selective catalysts among those tested for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation processes.
2. In the presence of CO2, propene production occurs through both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways.
3. High dispersion of chromium species is essential for achieving high activity in chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly those supported on silica.
4. Crystalline -Cr2O3 forms more readily at high temperatures and with excess water, being the most thermodynamically stable phase of chromium oxide.
5. This crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen, rendering it ineffective as a catalyst.

1. 含有Cr或Ga的材料被发现是CO2辅助脱氢过程中活性和选择性最高的催化剂。
2. 在CO2存在下，丙烯的产生同时伴随着脱氢和氧化脱氢途径。
3. 高分散的Cr物种对于获得高活性的Cr基氧化物催化剂至关重要，尤其是那些在硅胶上支持的催化剂。
4. 在高温和过量水的情况下，形成结晶态-Cr2O3更为容易，它是铬氧化物相中最稳定的形态。
5. 这种结晶态-Cr2O3对氢气和氧气具有高度的抗性，使其作为催化剂无效。
