1. Chromium (Cr) and Gallium (Ga)-containing materials were identified as the most active and selective catalysts among those tested for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (ODHP).

2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) negatively impacts the activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, whereas it promotes activity over the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

3. In the presence of CO2, Cr3+ and Cr2+ sites can engage in an alternative oxidative pathway of propene formation and contribute to hydrogen consumption via reverse water-gas shift reactions.

4. The presence of CO2 facilitates both dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways, leading to the production of propene.

5. The catalytic properties of a support can be either promoted or poisoned by CO2, depending on the nature of the support.

1. 铬(Cr)和镓(Ga)的材料被发现是催化CO2辅助丙烷脱氢反应活性和选择性最高的催化剂。

2. 二氧化碳(CO2)对Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂的活性有负面作用，而对Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂则有促进作用。

3. 在存在CO2的情况下，Cr3+和Cr2+位点可以参与丙烯形成过程中的氧化路径，并参与通过逆水煤气变换反应消耗氢气。

4. CO2的存在同时促进了脱氢和氧化脱氢反应路径，导致丙烯的生成。

5. 根据支持物的性质，CO2可以促进或毒害催化剂的活性。
