[1] "Among the investigated materials,those containing Cr or Ga were found to be the most active and selective."
[2] "The results of these investigations lead to the following general conclusions:"
[3] "(i) In the presence of CO2,propene is obtained simultaneously with dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation pathways."
[4] "(ii) The oxide catalysts which are active in the non-oxidative dehy- drogenation of propane are also active in the process with CO2."
[5] "(iii) Depending on the nature of the support, CO2 has a promot- ing or poisoning effect on its catalytic properties."
[6] "Cr species on 3+,5+ and 6+ oxidation states coexist on the surface of oxidized Cr/silica catalysts."
[7] "When the Cr content exceeds the monolayer coverage,amorphous and crystalline -Cr2O3 are formed."
[8] "The presence of -Cr2O3 on the surface of silica has a negative influence on the catalytic activity as not all of the Cr atoms are accessible to the reactant molecules."
[9] "Moreover,crystalline -Cr2O3 is highly resistant to hydrogen and oxygen what makes it useless as a catalyst."
[10] "Therefore,more attention has been recently paid to using high surface area mesoporous materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species."
[11] "These materials possess a 24 times larger surface area than the commercial silica gels and have a uniform pore structure."
[12] "In this work we presented a comparative study of the catalytic performance of chromium oxide supported on different siliceous supports including mesoporous sieves with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal (SBA-15) pore structure and two commercially available silica."
[13] "Using various physicochemical characterization techniques we investigated the influence of Cr loading and supports properties on the surface composition and Cr dispersion."
[14] "Finally based on the characterization results of catalysts we discussed the catalytic performance in the DHPCO2 process."
