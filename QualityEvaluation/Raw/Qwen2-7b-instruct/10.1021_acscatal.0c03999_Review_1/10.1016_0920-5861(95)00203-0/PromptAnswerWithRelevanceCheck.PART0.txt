<quotes>
[1] "The complementary nature of Raman and IR spectroscopy is reflected in the above review of the characterization of supported metal oxide catalysts. The molecular structures of the sur- face metal oxide species under ambient condi- tions, where the surface is hydrated with a thin aqueous layer, are determined by the net pH at the pzc of the supported metal oxide system.
The molecular structures under dehydrated con- ditions are spontaneously formed by self assem- bly and can not be influenced by preparation methods. The dehydrated molecular structures are both a function of surface coverage and the specific oxide support."
[2] "For many of the alumina supported metal oxide systems, monolayer cov- erage corresponds to approximately 4-5 atoms/nm 2. However, the surface coverage for the alumina supported rhenium oxide system is approximately half of this value and the surface coverage of the alumina supported vanadium oxide system is about double this value."
[3] "In situ Raman studies of the surface metal oxide species during reactions reveal that the oxidation states and structures of the surface metal oxide species can be altered by the reaction environment. The changes ob- served are both a function of the specific sup- ported metal oxide catalyst system and the spe- cific reaction environment."

1. The molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species on supported metal oxide catalysts are influenced by various factors. Under ambient conditions, the hydration of the surface is determined by the net pH at the point of zero charge (pzc) of the thin aqueous layer. Under dehydrated conditions, the molecular structures are formed by self-assembly and are not influenced by preparation methods. These structures depend on both the surface coverage and the specific oxide support.

2. Monolayer coverage of surface metal oxide species on various oxide supports generally corresponds to approximately 4-5 atoms/nm^2. However, the surface density of surface rhenium oxide species is typically lower due to volatilization, while the surface density of surface vanadium oxide species is higher due to its ability to pack more densely.

3. During catalytic reactions, the oxidation states and structures of surface metal oxide species can be altered based on the reaction environment. These changes are influenced by both the specific supported metal oxide catalyst system and the specific reaction environment.

1. 受支持的金属氧化物催化剂表面金属氧化物种的分子结构受到多种因素的影响。在环境条件下，表面的水合状态由支持金属氧化物体系中薄水层的零电荷点（pzc）的净pH值决定。在脱水条件下，分子结构通过自组装形成，并不受制备方法的影响。这些结构既依赖于表面覆盖度，也依赖于特定的氧化物支持。

2. 各种氧化物支持上的表面金属氧化物种的单层覆盖率通常对应于大约4-5个原子/nm^2。然而，表面铼氧化物种的表面密度通常较低，由于其挥发性，而表面钒氧化物种的表面密度较高，因为其能够更紧密地堆积。

3. 在催化反应期间，表面金属氧化物种的氧化态和结构可以根据反应环境进行改变。这些变化既受特定支持的金属氧化物种系统的影响，也受特定反应环境的影响。

[1] "For many oxide systems, the deposited metal oxide preferentially forms a two-dimensional surface metal oxide overlayer (surface metal oxide species) rather than a separate crystalline metal oxide phase or compound with the oxide support [1]."

[2] "Supported metal oxide catalysts find wide application in the petroleum, chemical and pollution control industries [2,3]."

[3] "The characterization methods generally applicable to supported metal oxide catalysts have recently been reviewed [3]. Raman and infrared are complementary spectroscopies that are among the unique characterization techniques that have provided fundamental molecular level information about the surface properties of supported metal oxide catalysts: molecular structure of the surface metal oxide species (ambient and in situ conditions), location of the surface metal oxide species, surface coverage of the metal oxide overlayer, distribution of surface Lewis and BrCnsted acid sites as well as the structure of the active surface metal oxide species during catalytic reactions."

[4] "Under reaction conditions, the surface metal oxide species can be unchanged, hydrated, reduced to a lower oxidation state or transformed to a crystalline phase. These changes depend on the specific supported metal oxide system and the specific reaction environment."

The document discusses how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It explains that the performance of these catalysts is influenced by the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The key factors affecting catalytic performance include the nature of the metal oxide catalyst, the loading of the metal oxide, the properties of the support, and the reaction conditions. The document also highlights that the surface metal oxide species can change during catalytic reactions, depending on the specific catalyst system and the reaction environment. These changes can involve the species remaining unchanged, becoming hydrated, being reduced to a lower oxidation state, or transforming into a crystalline phase.

Various studies have explored the comparison of metal oxide catalysts in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by the loading and properties of the support. These catalysts exhibit different behaviors based on the specific conditions and interactions within the catalytic process. In situ Raman studies have been crucial in understanding the changes in surface metal oxide species under ambient and dehydrated conditions. This allows researchers to observe how the species evolve and adapt to the evolving reaction environment, contributing to a deeper understanding of the catalyst's performance.

Catalysis Today 27 (1996) 437-455 Raman and IR studies of surface metal oxide species on oxide supports: Supported metal oxide catalysts Israel E. Wachs Zettlemoyer Center for Surface Studies and Department of Chemical Engineering, Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA 18015, USA Abstract Raman and infrared spectroscopy provide complementary information about the nature of the surface metal oxide species present in supported metal oxide catalysts. This paper reviews the type of fundamental information that is typically obtained in Raman and IR characterization studies of supported metal oxide catalysts. The molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species are reflected in the terminal M =O and bridging M-O-M vibrations. The location of the surface metal oxide species on the oxide supports is determined by directly monitoring the specific surface hydroxyls of the support that are being titrated. The surface coverage of the surface metal oxide species on the oxide supports can be quantitatively obtained since at monolayer coverage all the reactive surface hydroxyls are titrated and additional metal oxide results in the formation of crystalline metal oxide particles. The nature of surface Lewis and BrCnsted acid sites present in supported metal oxide catalysts are determined by adsorbing basic probe molecules like pyridine. Information about the behavior of the surface metal oxide species during catalytic reactions are provided by in situ characterization studies. Such fundamental information is critical for the development of molecular structure-reactivity relationships for supported metal oxide catalysts. This paper will be limited to supported metal oxide catalysts containing group V-VII transition metal oxides (e.g., V, Nb, Cr, Mo, W and Re) on several different oxide supports (alumina, titania, zirconia, niobia and silica).
