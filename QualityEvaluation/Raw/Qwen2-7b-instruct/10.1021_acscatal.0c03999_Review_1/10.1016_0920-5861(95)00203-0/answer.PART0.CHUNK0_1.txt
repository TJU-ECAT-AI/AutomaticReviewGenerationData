[1] "In situ IR studies during reactions reveal that the oxidation states and structures of the surface metal oxide species can be altered by the reaction environment. The changes observed are both a function of the specific supported metal oxide catalyst system and the specific reaction environment."
[2] "The first in situ Raman studies appeared in 1983 and were performed by Wang and Hall on supported rhenium oxide catalysts [84] and by Schrader and Cheng who reported on the sulfidation of alumina supported molybdenum oxide catalysts [85]."
