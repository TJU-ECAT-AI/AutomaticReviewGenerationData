[1] "The realization that the molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species are hydrated under ambient conditions lead to in situ Raman studies that attempted to determine the struc- tures of the dehydrated surface metal oxide species."
[2] "The first in situ Raman studies ap- peared in 1983 and were performed by Wang and Hall on supported rhenium oxide catalysts [84] and by Schrader and Cheng who reported on the sulfidation of alumina supported molybdenum oxide catalysts [85]."
[3] "In the subsequent year, several more in situ Raman studies ap- peared in the literature: Chan et al. reported the dehydrated spectra of supported vanadium ox- ide, tungsten oxide and molybdenum oxide cata- lysts [86] and Stencel et al. reported the dehy- drated spectra of supported molybdenum oxide [87] and tungsten oxide catalysts [27]."
[4] "The first dehydrated Raman spectra of supported chromium oxide catalysts were first reported by Hardcastle and Wachs in 1988 [88] and that of supported niobium oxide catalysts by Jehng and Wachs in 1991 [89]."
[5] "These in situ Raman stud- ies clearly showed that different surface metal oxide species were present under ambient and dehydrated conditions."

Various studies have explored the comparison of metal oxide catalysts in terms of their activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. The evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts is influenced by the loading and properties of the support. These catalysts exhibit different behaviors based on the specific conditions and interactions within the catalytic process. In situ Raman studies have been crucial in understanding the changes in surface metal oxide species under ambient and dehydrated conditions. This allows researchers to observe how the species evolve and adapt to the evolving reaction environment, contributing to a deeper understanding of the catalyst's performance.
