[1] "The complementary nature of Raman and IR spectroscopy is reflected in the above review of the characterization of supported metal oxide catalysts. The molecular structures of the sur- face metal oxide species under ambient condi- tions, where the surface is hydrated with a thin aqueous layer, are determined by the net pH at the pzc of the supported metal oxide system.
The molecular structures under dehydrated con- ditions are spontaneously formed by self assem- bly and can not be influenced by preparation methods. The dehydrated molecular structures are both a function of surface coverage and the specific oxide support."
[2] "For many of the alumina supported metal oxide systems, monolayer cov- erage corresponds to approximately 4-5 atoms/nm 2. However, the surface coverage for the alumina supported rhenium oxide system is approximately half of this value and the surface coverage of the alumina supported vanadium oxide system is about double this value."
[3] "In situ Raman studies of the surface metal oxide species during reactions reveal that the oxidation states and structures of the surface metal oxide species can be altered by the reaction environment. The changes ob- served are both a function of the specific sup- ported metal oxide catalyst system and the spe- cific reaction environment."

1. The molecular structures of the surface metal oxide species on supported metal oxide catalysts are influenced by various factors. Under ambient conditions, the hydration of the surface is determined by the net pH at the point of zero charge (pzc) of the thin aqueous layer. Under dehydrated conditions, the molecular structures are formed by self-assembly and are not influenced by preparation methods. These structures depend on both the surface coverage and the specific oxide support.

2. Monolayer coverage of surface metal oxide species on various oxide supports generally corresponds to approximately 4-5 atoms/nm^2. However, the surface density of surface rhenium oxide species is typically lower due to volatilization, while the surface density of surface vanadium oxide species is higher due to its ability to pack more densely.

3. During catalytic reactions, the oxidation states and structures of surface metal oxide species can be altered based on the reaction environment. These changes are influenced by both the specific supported metal oxide catalyst system and the specific reaction environment.

1. 受支持的金属氧化物催化剂表面金属氧化物种的分子结构受到多种因素的影响。在环境条件下，表面的水合状态由支持金属氧化物体系中薄水层的零电荷点（pzc）的净pH值决定。在脱水条件下，分子结构通过自组装形成，并不受制备方法的影响。这些结构既依赖于表面覆盖度，也依赖于特定的氧化物支持。

2. 各种氧化物支持上的表面金属氧化物种的单层覆盖率通常对应于大约4-5个原子/nm^2。然而，表面铼氧化物种的表面密度通常较低，由于其挥发性，而表面钒氧化物种的表面密度较高，因为其能够更紧密地堆积。

3. 在催化反应期间，表面金属氧化物种的氧化态和结构可以根据反应环境进行改变。这些变化既受特定支持的金属氧化物种系统的影响，也受特定反应环境的影响。
