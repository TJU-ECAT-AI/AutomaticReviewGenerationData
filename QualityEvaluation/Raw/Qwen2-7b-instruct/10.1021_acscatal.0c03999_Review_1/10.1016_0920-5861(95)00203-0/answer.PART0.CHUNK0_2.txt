[1] "For many oxide systems, the deposited metal oxide preferentially forms a two-dimensional surface metal oxide overlayer (surface metal oxide species) rather than a separate crystalline metal oxide phase or compound with the oxide support [1]."

[2] "Supported metal oxide catalysts find wide application in the petroleum, chemical and pollution control industries [2,3]."

[3] "The characterization methods generally applicable to supported metal oxide catalysts have recently been reviewed [3]. Raman and infrared are complementary spectroscopies that are among the unique characterization techniques that have provided fundamental molecular level information about the surface properties of supported metal oxide catalysts: molecular structure of the surface metal oxide species (ambient and in situ conditions), location of the surface metal oxide species, surface coverage of the metal oxide overlayer, distribution of surface Lewis and BrCnsted acid sites as well as the structure of the active surface metal oxide species during catalytic reactions."

[4] "Under reaction conditions, the surface metal oxide species can be unchanged, hydrated, reduced to a lower oxidation state or transformed to a crystalline phase. These changes depend on the specific supported metal oxide system and the specific reaction environment."

The document discusses how various metal oxide catalysts compare in terms of activity and selectivity for CO2-ODHP. It explains that the performance of these catalysts is influenced by the evolution of chromium species in supported Cr2O3 catalysts as a function of loading and support properties. The key factors affecting catalytic performance include the nature of the metal oxide catalyst, the loading of the metal oxide, the properties of the support, and the reaction conditions. The document also highlights that the surface metal oxide species can change during catalytic reactions, depending on the specific catalyst system and the reaction environment. These changes can involve the species remaining unchanged, becoming hydrated, being reduced to a lower oxidation state, or transforming into a crystalline phase.
