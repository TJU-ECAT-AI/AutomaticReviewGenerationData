Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP). Chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly those supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2), demonstrate the best catalytic performance. Carbon dioxide can react directly with hydrogen to produce water gas or act as a mild oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation. The synergistic effect between the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and dehydrogenation reactions explains the enhancing effect of CO2 on propane conversion and propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.

各种金属氧化物催化剂已被测试用于二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）。特别是那些支持在硅酸盐上的铬氧化物（CrOx/SiO2），表现出最佳的催化性能。二氧化碳可以直接与氢反应生成水气，或者作为轻度氧化剂参与氧化脱氢。逆水煤气变换（RWGS）和脱氢反应之间的协同作用解释了二氧化碳对CrOx/SiO2催化剂上丙烷转化率和丙烯产率的增强效果。
