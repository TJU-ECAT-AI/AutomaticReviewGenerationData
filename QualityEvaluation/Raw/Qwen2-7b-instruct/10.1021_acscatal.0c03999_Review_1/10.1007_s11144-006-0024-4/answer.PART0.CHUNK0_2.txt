[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]. One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."
[2] "The molar ratio of CO/H2 in the process with CO2 was close to unity."
[3] "For example, at 873 K and at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92 %, while in the presence of an inert gas, only 75 % conversion can be achieved under the same conditions [2]."
[4] "The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 systems."
[5] "The results suggest that the promoting effect of CO2 on the propane conversion and the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is caused by synergistic effect between the RWGS and the dehydrogenation reactions."

1. Chromium oxide catalysts, particularly those supported on SiO2, MCM-41, and Diamond, have shown excellent catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2. These systems have outperformed others like Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe oxides.
2. In the presence of CO2, the molar ratio of CO to H2 approaches unity, suggesting a balanced redox reaction.
3. At 873 K with a CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of 5, propane conversion reaches 92%, compared to only 75% with an inert gas under similar conditions.
4. Supported chromium oxide catalysts, notably CrOx/SiO2, have demonstrated the best catalytic performance.
5. The enhancement of propane conversion and propene yield by CO2 over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect between the RWGS and dehydrogenation reactions.

1. 铬氧化物催化剂，特别是那些支持在SiO2、MCM-41和钻石上的系统，在丙烷脱氢与二氧化碳反应中表现出优秀的催化性能。这些系统优于其他如镓、铬、钒、铈和铁氧化物。
2. 在二氧化碳的存在下，CO与H2的摩尔比接近于1，表明了平衡的氧化还原反应。
3. 在873 K时，当CO2/C3H8的摩尔比为5时，丙烷转化率达到了92%，而在相同条件下使用惰性气体时，只有75%的转化率。
4. 支持的铬氧化物催化剂，尤其是CrOx/SiO2，已经显示出最佳的催化性能。
5. 二氧化碳对CrOx/SiO2催化剂上丙烷转化率和丙烯产率的增强作用归因于水煤气逆向反应和脱氢反应之间的协同效应。
