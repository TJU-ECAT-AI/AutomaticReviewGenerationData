[1] "Several supported and unsupported metal oxides (Ga, Cr, V, Ce and Fe) have been tested in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 [2-6]."
[2] "One of the most promising catalysts are based of chromium oxide. The best catalytic performance has been observed for CrOx/SiO2 [3], CrOx/MCM-41 [4] and CrOx/Diamond [5] systems."
[3] "The generally accepted role of carbon dioxide in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is removal of hydrogen and suppression of coke deposition on the catalyst surface."
[4] "The oxidative pathway has been proposed for dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons over vanadium [7], chromium [2, 4, 8], cerium [9] and iron [10,11] oxide catalysts, whereas over gallium oxide the non-redox pathway is more likely [12]."
[5] "In the present paper, the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is reported."
[6] "We investigate the role of CO2 in this reaction on the basis of the results obtained in the catalyzed and non-catalyzed RWGS and DH-CO2 reactions."
[7] "It was found that the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is active both in the dehydrogenation of propane and in the RWGS reactions."
[8] "The molar ratio of CO/H2 in the process with CO2 was close to unity."
[9] "For example, at 873 K and at a molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 5, the equilibrium conversion of propane reaches 92%, while in the presence of an inert gas, only 75% conversion can be achieved under the same conditions [2]."
[10] "Under CO2 atmosphere the propene yield and the propane conversion reached 33.5% and 36.3%, respectively, while under He 26.1% and 28.7%."
[11] "A trace of carbon monoxide was also formed in the reaction carried out without CO2. This by-product was observed only at the initial step of dehydrogenation of propane and was probably formed as a result of Cr6+ (presented on the surface of the fresh catalyst) reduction by propane."
[12] "The results suggest that the promoting effect of CO2 on the propane conversion and the propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is caused by synergistic effect between the RWGS and the dehydrogenation reactions."

1. Supported metal oxides tested for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (DPH) include Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe. Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/MCM-41, and CrOx/Diamond systems, have demonstrated the best catalytic performance.
2. Chromium oxide catalysts are active in both propane dehydrogenation and the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction. The synergy between these two reactions enhances the catalytic performance of CrOx/SiO2.
3. Carbon dioxide plays a dual role in the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, primarily removing hydrogen and suppressing coke deposition on the catalyst surface. Its oxidative pathway is proposed for dehydrogenation over vanadium, chromium, cerium, and iron oxide catalysts.
4. The dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst is reported in this study, with a focus on understanding its role in the RWGS and propane dehydrogenation reactions.
5. The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst exhibits activity in both the RWGS and propane dehydrogenation reactions. This dual functionality contributes to the catalyst's efficiency in these processes.
6. In the presence of CO2, the molar ratio of CO to H2 approaches unity, suggesting a balanced redox process that facilitates the dehydrogenation of propane.
7. At 873 K, a higher equilibrium conversion of propane (92%) is achieved with CO2 compared to an inert gas (75%). This highlights the enhanced dehydrogenation capability of CO2.
8. The presence of CO2 significantly improves the propene yield and propane conversion over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst, reaching 33.5% and 36.3%, respectively, under CO2 atmosphere.
9. The formation of carbon monoxide during the reaction without CO2 indicates the reduction of Cr6+ species on the catalyst surface by propane, which might influence the catalytic activity.
10. The synergy between the RWGS and propane dehydrogenation reactions, promoted by CO2, is suggested to be the primary factor enhancing the catalytic performance of the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst in CO2-assisted DPH.
