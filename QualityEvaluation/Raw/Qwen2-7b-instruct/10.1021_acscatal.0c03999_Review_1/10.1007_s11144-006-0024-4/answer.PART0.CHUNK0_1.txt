The document discusses the comparative activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) is highlighted as a particularly effective catalyst, especially when supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2), which exhibits the best catalytic performance. The synergy between the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and dehydrogenation reactions is suggested as the reason for CO2's positive effect on propane conversion and propene yield over CrOx/SiO2 catalysts. Chromium species' evolution as a function of loading and support properties influences the catalytic performance.

文档讨论了各种金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中的比较活性和选择性。铬氧化物（Cr2O3）特别被强调为有效的催化剂，特别是在硅基负载下时，CrOx/SiO2显示出最佳的催化性能。推测逆水煤气变换（RWGS）和脱氢反应之间的协同作用是CO2对CrOx/SiO2催化剂上丙烷转化率和丙烯产率提升的原因。铬物种的演化，依赖于负载量和支持性质，影响着催化剂的性能。
