1. Metal oxides tested for CO2-ODHP include Ga, Cr, V, Ce, and Fe. Among these, chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/MCM-41, and CrOx/Diamond, show the best catalytic performance.
2. Carbon dioxide plays a role in removing hydrogen and preventing coke deposition on the catalyst surface during the dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons.
3. The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst demonstrates activity in both propane dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions.
4. The molar ratio of CO to H2 in the CO2 atmosphere is nearly equal, indicating a balanced reaction environment.
5. The CrOx/SiO2 catalyst experiences similar patterns of deactivation in both propane dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions.
