Various metal oxide catalysts have been tested for CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation (CO2-ODHP). Chromium oxide-based catalysts, particularly those supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2), demonstrate the best catalytic performance. Carbon dioxide can react directly with hydrogen to produce water gas or act as a mild oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation. The synergistic effect between the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and dehydrogenation reactions explains the enhancing effect of CO2 on propane conversion and propene yield over the CrOx/SiO2 catalyst.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The document discusses the comparative activity and selectivity of various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) is highlighted as a particularly effective catalyst, especially when supported on silica (CrOx/SiO2), which exhibits the best catalytic performance. The synergy between the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) and dehydrogenation reactions is suggested as the reason for CO2's positive effect on propane conversion and propene yield over CrOx/SiO2 catalysts. Chromium species' evolution as a function of loading and support properties influences the catalytic performance.
