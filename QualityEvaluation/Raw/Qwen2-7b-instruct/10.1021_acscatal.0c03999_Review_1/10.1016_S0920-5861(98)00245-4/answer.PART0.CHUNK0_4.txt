[1] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts."
[2] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The document highlights that among various metal oxide catalysts, SiO2-supported catalysts exhibit enhanced performance in terms of propane dehydrogenation when exposed to CO2. Specifically, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts show a notable promotion effect, improving the yield of propylene (C3H6) and mitigating catalyst deactivation. This is attributed to the partially oxidized state of the Cr2O3 surface maintained during the reaction in the presence of CO2, which contributes to the catalyst's activity and stability. The document further elucidates that the promotion effect occurs at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles, indicating a critical role for the support material in facilitating this catalytic enhancement.

文献表明，在各种金属氧化物催化剂中，仅SiO2支持的催化剂在CO2存在下显示出丙烷脱氢性能的提升。特别是，SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂表现出显著的促进效果，提高了丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制了催化剂的失活。这归因于在CO2存在的条件下，Cr2O3表面部分氧化状态的维持，这对催化剂的活性和稳定性有贡献。文献进一步解释了这种促进效果发生在Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒之间的边界上，表明支持材料在促进这一催化增强中的关键作用。
