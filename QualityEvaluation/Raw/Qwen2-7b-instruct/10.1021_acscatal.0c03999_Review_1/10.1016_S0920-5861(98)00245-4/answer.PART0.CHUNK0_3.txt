The study compared various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). It was found that only SiO2-supported catalysts showed promoting effects of carbon dioxide. Specifically, Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts enhanced the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressed catalyst deactivation. The activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst increased by 40% in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited higher activity in the dehydrogenation of propane than their reduced counterparts. The surface of Cr2O3 on the SiO2 support was observed to be reduced during dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, but partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2. This indicates that the partially oxidized state of Cr2O3 is beneficial for the catalytic process, especially when CO2 is present.

该研究对比了几种金属氧化物催化剂在二氧化碳辅助丙烷脱氢（CO2-ODHP）过程中的性能。发现只有SiO2支持的催化剂显示出二氧化碳的促进作用。具体而言，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂提高了丙烯（C3H6）的产率，并抑制了催化剂的失活。在二氧化碳存在下，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的活性比没有二氧化碳时提高了40%。部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在丙烷脱氢过程中比其还原状态更活跃。在二氧化碳存在的条件下，SiO2支持的Cr2O3表面保持部分氧化状态。这表明部分氧化的Cr2O3状态对催化过程是有利的，尤其是当存在二氧化碳时。
