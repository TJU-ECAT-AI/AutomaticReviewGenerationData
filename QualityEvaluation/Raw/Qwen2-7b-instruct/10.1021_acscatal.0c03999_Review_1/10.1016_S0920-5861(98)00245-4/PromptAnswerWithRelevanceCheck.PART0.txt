[1] "The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts."
[2] "The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2."
[3] "On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2."
[4] "Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/ SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4."
[5] "This finding suggests that the partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst."
[6] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[7] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

1. Various metal oxide catalysts, including Cr2O3 supported on different supports such as Al2O3, active carbon, and SiO2, were compared for their catalytic performance in CO2-ODHP (dehydrogenation of propane). The silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts showed distinct promoting effects from CO2, enhancing the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressing catalyst deactivation. 
2. The activity of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts significantly decreased when CO2 was present during the reaction, contrasting with the behavior of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts. The latter showed a surprising 40% increase in activity in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. 
3. The ratio of C3H6 yield in the presence of CO2 to that in its absence decreased with an increase in Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, suggesting the importance of the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles in the promoting effect of CO2.
4. Pulse reaction studies demonstrated that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts were more active for the dehydrogenation of propane than their reduced counterparts. This suggests that the surface of Cr2O3 might be partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2, maintaining a state conducive to enhanced catalytic activity.
5. The partially oxidized state of Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalysts indicates that these materials are highly effective for the dehydrogenation of propane, especially when CO2 is present. This state is thought to contribute to the catalyst's superior performance under CO2 conditions.
6. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts appears to maintain a state of partial oxidation, which is beneficial for the dehydrogenation of propane. This partial oxidation might be a key factor in the catalyst's enhanced activity and resistance to deactivation.

1. 不同金属氧化物催化剂，特别是Cr2O3支持在不同载体上的催化剂，如Al2O3、活性碳和SiO2，在CO2-ODHP（丙烷脱氢）中的催化性能进行了比较。发现SiO2支持的Cr2O3催化剂显示出CO2的促进效应，提高了丙烯（C3H6）的产率，并抑制了催化剂的失活。
2. Cr2O3/Al2O3催化剂在CO2存在下的活性显著低于其在无CO2条件下的活性。相比之下，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂在CO2存在下表现出惊人的40%的活性提高，与无CO2条件相比。
3. Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂中Cr2O3含量增加时，CO2存在下与无CO2条件下的C3H6产率比下降，表明Cr2O3和SiO2颗粒边界在CO2促进效应中的重要性。
4. 脉冲反应研究表明，部分氧化的Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂对丙烷脱氢的活性高于其还原状态。这表明Cr2O3表面可能在CO2条件下维持部分氧化状态，有利于增强催化活性并防止失活。
5. Cr2O3支持在SiO2催化剂的部分氧化状态表明这些材料对于丙烷脱氢特别有效，尤其是在CO2存在的条件下。这种部分氧化状态可能是催化剂增强活性和抵抗失活的关键因素。
6. 在CO2存在的情况下，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂表面似乎维持部分氧化状态，这对于丙烷脱氢是有利的。这种部分氧化状态可能是催化剂活性和抗失活性的关键。

The study reveals that among various metal oxide catalysts, those supported on SiO2 exhibit enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) when carbon dioxide (CO2) is present. Specifically, the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts show significant promoting effects of CO2, which include boosting the yield of propylene (C3H6) and mitigating catalyst deactivation. This improvement is attributed to the unique interaction between CO2 and the chromium oxide (Cr2O3) phase on the SiO2 support. Partial oxidation of the Cr2O3 surface facilitates better activity in PDH, especially in the presence of CO2, where the surface maintains a partially oxidized state, enhancing the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

研究表明，在各种金属氧化物催化剂中，SiO2支持的催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中仅在存在二氧化碳（CO2）时表现出增强性能。具体而言，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂显示出CO2的显著促进效果，这包括提高丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活。这种改进归因于CO2与SiO2支撑上的Cr2O3相的独特相互作用。部分氧化的Cr2O3表面有助于PDH的更好活性，尤其是在存在CO2的情况下，表面维持部分氧化状态，从而增强催化剂的稳定性和效率。

The document highlights that the promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance by carbon dioxide (CO2) was observed exclusively on catalysts supported on silica (SiO2). Specifically, over a chromium oxide (Cr2O3)/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 exhibited enhancing effects on the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppression of catalyst deactivation. The active site for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) is identified as partially oxidized chromium oxide supported on silica. During the reaction in the presence of CO2, the surface of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst may remain partially oxidized, contributing to its enhanced activity.

The study compared various metal oxide catalysts for CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). It was found that only SiO2-supported catalysts showed promoting effects of carbon dioxide. Specifically, Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts enhanced the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppressed catalyst deactivation. The activity of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst increased by 40% in the presence of CO2 compared to its absence. Partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts exhibited higher activity in the dehydrogenation of propane than their reduced counterparts. The surface of Cr2O3 on the SiO2 support was observed to be reduced during dehydrogenation in the absence of CO2, but partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2. This indicates that the partially oxidized state of Cr2O3 is beneficial for the catalytic process, especially when CO2 is present.

The document highlights that among various metal oxide catalysts, SiO2-supported catalysts exhibit enhanced performance in terms of propane dehydrogenation when exposed to CO2. Specifically, SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts show a notable promotion effect, improving the yield of propylene (C3H6) and mitigating catalyst deactivation. This is attributed to the partially oxidized state of the Cr2O3 surface maintained during the reaction in the presence of CO2, which contributes to the catalyst's activity and stability. The document further elucidates that the promotion effect occurs at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles, indicating a critical role for the support material in facilitating this catalytic enhancement.
