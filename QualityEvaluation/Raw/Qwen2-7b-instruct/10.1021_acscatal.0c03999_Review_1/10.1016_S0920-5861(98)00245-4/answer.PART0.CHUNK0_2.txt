The document highlights that the promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance by carbon dioxide (CO2) was observed exclusively on catalysts supported on silica (SiO2). Specifically, over a chromium oxide (Cr2O3)/SiO2 catalyst, CO2 exhibited enhancing effects on the yield of propylene (C3H6) and suppression of catalyst deactivation. The active site for the dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8) is identified as partially oxidized chromium oxide supported on silica. During the reaction in the presence of CO2, the surface of the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst may remain partially oxidized, contributing to its enhanced activity.

文献表明，仅在以硅酸盐为载体的催化剂上观察到了二氧化碳促进丙烷脱氢性能的现象。特别是对于Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂，二氧化碳能够提高丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活。活性位点被确认为部分氧化的铬氧化物支持在硅酸盐上。在二氧化碳存在的反应过程中，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂的表面可能保持部分氧化状态，这有助于增强其活性。
