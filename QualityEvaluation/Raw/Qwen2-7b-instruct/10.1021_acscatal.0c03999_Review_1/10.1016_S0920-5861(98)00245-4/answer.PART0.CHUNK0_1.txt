[1] "Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts."
[2] "The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation."
[3] "The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8."
[4] "In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction."

The study reveals that among various metal oxide catalysts, those supported on SiO2 exhibit enhanced performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) when carbon dioxide (CO2) is present. Specifically, the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalysts show significant promoting effects of CO2, which include boosting the yield of propylene (C3H6) and mitigating catalyst deactivation. This improvement is attributed to the unique interaction between CO2 and the chromium oxide (Cr2O3) phase on the SiO2 support. Partial oxidation of the Cr2O3 surface facilitates better activity in PDH, especially in the presence of CO2, where the surface maintains a partially oxidized state, enhancing the catalyst's stability and efficiency.

研究表明，在各种金属氧化物催化剂中，SiO2支持的催化剂在丙烷脱氢（PDH）过程中仅在存在二氧化碳（CO2）时表现出增强性能。具体而言，Cr2O3/SiO2催化剂显示出CO2的显著促进效果，这包括提高丙烯（C3H6）的产率并抑制催化剂失活。这种改进归因于CO2与SiO2支撑上的Cr2O3相的独特相互作用。部分氧化的Cr2O3表面有助于PDH的更好活性，尤其是在存在CO2的情况下，表面维持部分氧化状态，从而增强催化剂的稳定性和效率。
