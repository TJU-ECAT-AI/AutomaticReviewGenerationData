The cubic mesoporous molecular sieve SBA-1 was engineered to have controlled pore sizes, enhancing its mechanical stability. Chromium oxide (Cr2O3) catalysts were supported on the SBA-1 framework. The catalytic performance of these supported catalysts was notably affected by the chromium loading and the properties of the support. The evolution of chromium species was monitored as a function of the catalyst loading.
