[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through various techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[2] "This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces."
