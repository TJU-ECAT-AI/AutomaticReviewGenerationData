[1] "The study of metals deposited on a metallic substrate has seen rapid growth in recent years, with attention focused both on the deposition and heteroepitaxial growth of A on B as well as on the fabrication of multilayers with alternating modulations of layers of A and B of varying thickness."
[2] "We have focused on four concentrations (c=0.05, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and various cluster configurations (point, pair, triplet, as shown in Fig. 1 )."
[3] "Secondly, investigating the NN pair energies in Table 1 we note that these energies are rather weak and mainly positive, i.e. repulsive. Thus adsorption will tend to proceed in such a way that no compact superstructures are formed."
[4] "As a general conclusion, we find clear evidence for the competition between the different superstructures due to the complexity and frustration between the ECI."
[5] "At c=0.75 and from a temperature of 11.6 K on the c(2 × 6) phase has entirely disappeared, the sample consisting of 90% c(2 × 4) and the remainder being small disordered islands."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, which are essential in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
