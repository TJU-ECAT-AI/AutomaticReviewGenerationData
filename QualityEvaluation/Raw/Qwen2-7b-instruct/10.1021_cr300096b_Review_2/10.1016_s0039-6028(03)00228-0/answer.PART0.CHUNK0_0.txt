[1] "The study of metals deposited on a metallic substrate has seen rapid growth in recent years, with attention focused both on the deposition and heteroepitaxial growth of A on B as well as on the fabrication of multilayers with alternating modulations of layers of A and B of varying thickness."
[2] "The Ni on Pt(1 1 1) system does not seem to have been considered previously in the theoretical literature, but Majerus et al. performed an effective medium calculation of various Pt/Ni single-atom adsorbate combinations, which bear some relevance to the system at hand."
[3] "We have studied the initial stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(1 1 1). Using the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method we calculate various ordering interactions."
[4] "We have focused on four concentrations (c=0.05, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and various cluster configurations (point, pair, triplet, as shown in Fig. 1 )."
[5] "Secondly, investigating the NN pair energies in Table 1 we note that these energies are rather weak and mainly positive, i.e. repulsive."
[6] "In general fcc structures tend to be somewhat more ordered than hcp structures at the same temperature (T) and concentration (c)."
[7] "The dominant superstructures encountered in the simulations are the c(2 × 4) and c(2 × 6) phases, generally coexisting, in ratios that are variable, depending on T and c."
[8] "At c=0.75 and from a temperature of 11.6 K on the c(2 × 6) phase has entirely disappeared, the sample consisting of 90% c(2 × 4) and the remainder being small disordered islands."
[9] "These findings constitute the first steps in a determination of the cT phase diagram for this system, which is expected to be particularly rich in view of the subtle interplay between the various point energies and ECIs."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The research focuses on calculating various ordering interactions using the tight-binding direct-configurational-averaging method. The study investigates different concentrations and cluster configurations, noting that at low concentrations, the energies for hcp sites are lower than for fcc sites. As concentration increases, a stability inversion occurs, favoring fcc sites. The simulations reveal a complex competition between different superstructures, with the c(2 × 4) and c(2 × 6) phases being the dominant ones, often coexisting in varying ratios based on temperature and concentration. The research provides insights into the phase diagram for this system, highlighting the intricate interplay between point energies and ECIs, contributing to a better understanding of the bimetallic surfaces' behavior and potential applications.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。研究利用紧束缚直接构象平均方法计算各种排列相互作用。研究关注不同的浓度和簇配置，发现低浓度时hcp位点的能量低于fcc位点。随着浓度增加，稳定性反转发生，倾向于fcc位点。模拟显示不同超结构之间存在复杂竞争，c(2 × 4)和c(2 × 6)相是主导相，通常以变化的比例共存，基于温度和浓度。研究提供了该系统的相图信息，强调点能量和ECI之间的微妙相互作用，有助于更好地理解双金属表面的行为及其潜在应用。
