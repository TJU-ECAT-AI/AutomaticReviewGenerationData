2. In the present work, our main interest is in the growth at low coverage and relatively low temperatures. Therefore, we have restricted the morphological structures to two-dimensional systems, without taking into account a possible interdiffusion between adatoms and substrate. Thus, we must consider a temperature regime at which surface diffusion is active, but bulk diffusion is not.
This methodology is crucial because it allows for the accurate prediction of the initial stages of Ni adsorption on Pt(111) and the subsequent phase behavior under controlled conditions.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates at low coverage and relatively low temperatures. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it enables the investigation of the initial stages of Ni adsorption and the subsequent phase behavior under controlled conditions, which is essential for predicting and optimizing the performance of these materials in various applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层，在较低覆盖度和相对较低温度下进行。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它允许对Ni吸附的初始阶段和随后的相行为进行控制条件下的研究，这对于预测和优化这些材料在各种应用中的性能至关重要。
