<p>In the present work we study one such system, viz. the growth of Ni on Pt(1 1 1), which has been the subject of prior experimental [2] ,[3] ,[4] work in which it was reported that the initial stages of the Ni growth occur in the hcp adsorption sites on the (1 1 1) face with little or no evidence for intermixing with the substrate.</p>
<p>We have focused on four concentrations (c=0.05, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75) and various cluster configurations (point, pair, triplet, as shown in Fig. 1).</p>

<p>The first clear tendency to be deduced from Table 1 is that in the dilute limit the point energies for the hcp site are lower than for the fcc sites, while for increasing concentration a stability inversion occurs, favoring the fcc sites at higher coverage.</p>
<p>Secondly, investigating the NN pair energies in Table 1 we note that these energies are rather weak and mainly positive, i.e. repulsive.</p>
<p>To address these questions we have performed a large number of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for a range of coverages and temperatures.</p>
<p>As a general conclusion, we find clear evidence for the competition between the different superstructures due to the complexity and frustration between the ECI.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows two representative snapshots of the kind of structures encountered.</p>
<p>For adsorption in the fcc sites ( Fig. 2a ) on notices the presence of the two dominant phases (c(2 × 4) and c(2 × 6)) as well as a small patch of the p(1×1) phase.</p>
<p>In contrast the hcp domains ( Fig. 2b ) consist predominantly of c(2 × 4), with some isolated regions of c(2 × 6) and c(2×2) character.</p>

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insight into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, particularly in the realms of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The initial stages of the Ni growth occur in hcp adsorption sites, with little intermixing with the substrate. As the concentration increases, the system exhibits a stability inversion, favoring fcc sites at higher coverage. The characterization also reveals the presence of two dominant phases, c(2 × 4) and c(2 × 6), with the system often transitioning between these phases based on temperature and coverage. The competition between different superstructures, influenced by the complexity and frustration between energy coefficients, leads to rich phase behavior. Representative snapshots illustrate the coexistence of these phases, with specific patterns observed in fcc and hcp sites.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，尤其是在先进表面科学和催化研究领域。Ni生长的初始阶段发生在hcp吸附位点，与基体几乎没有混合。随着浓度的增加，系统表现出稳定性反转，高覆盖度时倾向于fcc位点。表征还揭示了两种主导相的存在，c(2 × 4)和c(2 × 6)，系统往往根据温度和覆盖率在这两种相之间过渡。不同超结构之间的竞争，受到能量系数复杂性和挫折的影响，导致丰富的相图行为。代表性的快照说明了这些相的存在，具体模式在fcc和hcp位点中观察到。
