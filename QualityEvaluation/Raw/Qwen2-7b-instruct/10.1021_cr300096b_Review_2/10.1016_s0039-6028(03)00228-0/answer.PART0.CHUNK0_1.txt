The Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces are synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control and characterization of the interface between the two metals. The electronic structure and chemical interactions at the interface significantly influence the properties and functionalities of the resulting composite material.
