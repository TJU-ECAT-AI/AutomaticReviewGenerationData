[1] "Density functional theory studies of adsorption of oxygen electroreduction intermediates and free energy profiles are used to discuss possible reaction mechanisms: one leading directly to H2O production and another having H2O2 as an intermediate, on (111) surfaces of pure Pt, pure Pd, and bimetallic systems Pd0.75Co0.25 and Pt0.75Co0.25."
[2] "It is found that the calculated affinities toward the different ORR intermediates in the studied surfaces follow the Hammer-Norskov d-band model predictions."
[3] "The calculated free energy profiles and the magnitude of the barriers in both mechanisms seem to favor the hypothesis that both the direct and series O2 reduction mechanisms might be operating in parallel."
[4] "The highest thermodynamic barriers at 1/4 of a monolayer atomic oxygen coverage and without solvent are located in the first hydrogenation reaction for both mechanisms."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By calculating the affinities of oxygen electroreduction intermediates and free energy profiles for direct and series reaction mechanisms on the surfaces, scientists can determine how effectively these surfaces facilitate the oxygen reduction reaction. This understanding is essential for optimizing the performance of catalysts in fuel cell applications.
