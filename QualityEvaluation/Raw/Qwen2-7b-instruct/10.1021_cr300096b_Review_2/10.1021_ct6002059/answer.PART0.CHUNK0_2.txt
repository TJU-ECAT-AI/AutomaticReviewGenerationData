[1] "Density functional theory studies of adsorption of oxygen electroreduction intermediates and free energy profiles are used to discuss possible reaction mechanisms: one leading directly to H2O production and another having H2O2 as an intermediate, on (111) surfaces of pure Pt, pure Pd, and bimetallic systems Pd0.75Co0.25 and Pt0.75Co0.25."
[2] "The effect of water in the overall reaction, its similarities and differences among the different catalysts, changes in adsorption energies, and effects in the overall reaction will be addressed in future work where the results will also be contrasted with the ones here presented."
[3] "After alloying, surface properties can be generally affected in many different ways. Succinctly these changes can be classified as electronic (for example, band shifting due to the presence of a second component) and structural such as one component island formation, skin formation, and/or lattice constant changes."
[4] "The d-band center is located 2.06 eV below the Fermi level in the Pd0.75Co0.25 surface, 1.88 eV for the Pd surface, 2.36 eV for Pt, and 2.49 eV for Pt0.75Co0.25."
[5] "Adsorption energies and free energy profiles for direct and series reaction mechanisms on (111) surfaces of Pt, Pd, Pd0.75Co0.25, and Pt0.75Co0.25 indicate that the affinities toward the different ORR intermediates and reactivity trends on the studied surfaces follow the prediction of the d-band model."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a series of methods aimed at understanding the structural, electronic, and chemical properties of these surfaces. The process involves:

1. **Structural Modeling**: The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt substrate. This step is crucial for creating surfaces with distinct structures that can influence the reactivity of the materials. The deposition process typically requires careful control over the growth conditions to ensure the formation of a stable and uniform monolayer.

2. **Density Functional Theory (DFT) Calculations**: DFT is employed to simulate the electronic structure of the bimetallic surfaces. This computational approach allows researchers to calculate the energy levels of the valence bands and conduction bands, which are essential for understanding the electronic properties of the materials. By focusing on the d-band center and its variations across different compositions, scientists can predict how the electronic structure affects the adsorption of various species, such as oxygen electroreduction intermediates.

3. **Analysis of Adsorption Energies and Free Energy Profiles**: DFT calculations are also used to determine the adsorption energies of oxygen electroreduction intermediates on the bimetallic surfaces. These energies provide insights into the stability of the intermediates on the surface and guide the understanding of reaction pathways. Additionally, free energy profiles for different reaction mechanisms are generated to assess the thermodynamics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on these surfaces. The profiles help in identifying the activation barriers for each step of the reaction, which is critical for optimizing catalyst performance.

4. **Contrast with Pure Metals**: The results from the bimetallic systems are compared with those from pure Pt surfaces. This comparison helps in elucidating the synergistic effects of the alloy composition on the reactivity of the surfaces. By analyzing the differences in adsorption energies, free energy profiles, and reactivity trends, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of how the electronic and structural modifications influence the catalytic activity of the materials.

5. **Future Work**: The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces also involves future work aimed at incorporating the effect of water on the overall reaction. This includes studying the changes in adsorption energies, the similarities and differences among the different catalysts, and the impact of water on the reaction mechanisms. Such studies are essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic processes involved in oxygen reduction reactions and for tailoring materials with enhanced performance for applications such as fuel cells.
