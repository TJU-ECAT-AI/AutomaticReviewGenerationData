[2] "The effect of water in the overall reaction, its similarities and differences among the different catalysts, changes in adsorption energies, and effects in the overall reaction will be addressed in future work where the results will also be contrasted with the ones here presented."
[3] "The geometries of the different species in this study are relaxed using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)25-28 method ensuring that residual forces are below 10-3 Ry/au and with a change in total energy under 10-4 Ry between BFGS steps."
[4] "The reference calculation for oxygen in the gas phase yielded a triplet as the most stable electronic structure with a OO bonding distance of 1.23 Å and dissociation energy of 5.81 eV."
[5] "The Pt surface of the Pt0.75Co0.25 alloy shows ΔG values along the path that are above the Pt and Pd0.75Co0.25 surfaces, while the ΔG values corresponding to the Pd surface which has the strongest bonds with the intermediates is below."
[6] "In all surfaces in this study, the preferred adsorption site for atomic oxygen is found to be the fcc hollow site (in good agreement with previously reported results36), followed by hcp hollow, and then the top site."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying their electronic and chemical properties using advanced surface science techniques and computational methods. This process is crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of how these surfaces behave in catalytic applications, as it allows researchers to tailor the properties of the surfaces for specific reactions and improve their efficiency and selectivity.

2. The effect of water in the overall oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and its influence on adsorption energies across different catalyst surfaces, along with the similarities and differences among catalysts, will be explored in subsequent studies. These findings will be compared with the current research outcomes to provide insights into optimizing catalyst performance for enhanced ORR efficiency.

3. The geometries of the various species in the study are refined using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) optimization method, ensuring that the residual forces are minimized and the total energy changes are negligible between iterative steps. This approach facilitates the accurate determination of molecular structures and energetics.

4. In the gas phase, oxygen exists as a triplet with an OO bond distance of 1.23 Å and a dissociation energy of 5.81 eV. This fundamental property influences the interactions of oxygen with surface materials and is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of oxygen reduction reactions.

5. The Pt surface of the Pt0.75Co0.25 alloy demonstrates thermodynamically unfavorable ΔG values along the ORR pathway compared to the Pt and Pd0.75Co0.25 surfaces. Conversely, the Pd surface, characterized by stronger bonds with ORR intermediates, exhibits more favorable ΔG values, indicating its potential for enhanced ORR activity.

6. In the studied surfaces, atomic oxygen tends to adsorb preferentially at the face-centered cubic (fcc) hollow site, which aligns with previous reports. This preference influences the adsorption energies and the overall ORR mechanism on these surfaces.

1. 对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成，涉及使用高级表面科学技术和计算方法研究它们的电子和化学性质。这一过程对于开发对特定反应具有针对性且提高效率和选择性的表面行为的全面理解至关重要。

2. 水在整体氧还原反应（ORR）中的作用以及它对不同催化剂表面吸附能的影响，包括催化剂之间的相似性和差异，将在后续的研究中进行探讨。这些发现将与当前研究结果进行对比，以提供优化催化剂性能以增强ORR效率的见解。

3. 在研究中，各种物种的几何结构通过Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno（BFGS）优化方法进行细化，确保残余力最小化，并在迭代步骤之间总能量变化微小。这种方法有助于准确确定分子结构和能态。

4. 在气相中，氧以三重态存在，具有1.23 Å的OO键距和5.81 eV的解离能。这一基本属性影响了氧气与表面材料的相互作用，并对于理解氧还原反应机制至关重要。

5. Pt0.75Co0.25合金的Pt表面沿ORR途径的ΔG值相比于Pt和Pd0.75Co0.25表面表现出不利的倾向。相反，具有更强与ORR中间体结合能力的Pd表面显示出更有利于ΔG的值，这表明其可能具有增强的ORR活性。

6. 在研究的表面上，原子氧倾向于优先吸附在面心立方（fcc）空位位置，这与先前的报告一致。这种偏好影响了吸附能和整个ORR机制。
