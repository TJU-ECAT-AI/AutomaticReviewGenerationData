[1] "If the d-band model holds for these metals the strengths of the adsorbatesurface interactions should be in increasing order: PtCo < Pt < PdCo < Pd; an analysis of adsorption energy values in Tables 26 shows that the agreement is indeed excellent."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
If the d-band theory applies to these metals, the strength of interaction between adsorbates and surfaces should increase in the order PtCo < Pt < PdCo < Pd. The comparison of adsorption energy values in Tables 26 confirms this agreement remarkably well.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
如果d带理论适用于这些金属，吸附剂与表面之间的相互作用强度应按照PtCo < Pt < PdCo < Pd的顺序增加。在表26中吸附能值的对比显示了这种一致性确实非常出色。

[1] "After alloying, surface properties can be generally affected in many different ways. Succinctly these changes can be classified as electronic (for example, band shifting due to the presence of a second component) and structural such as one component island formation, skin formation, and/or lattice constant changes."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Upon alloying, surface properties can typically undergo a multitude of alterations. These changes can generally be categorized into electronic (like shifts in bands due to a secondary component) and structural aspects, such as the formation of single-component islands, skin layers, or lattice constant modifications.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
合金化后，表面性质可能会以多种方式改变。这些变化通常可以分为电子性质（例如，由于第二组分的存在导致的能带偏移）和结构特性，比如单组分岛屿的形成、表面层的生成或晶格常数的变化。
