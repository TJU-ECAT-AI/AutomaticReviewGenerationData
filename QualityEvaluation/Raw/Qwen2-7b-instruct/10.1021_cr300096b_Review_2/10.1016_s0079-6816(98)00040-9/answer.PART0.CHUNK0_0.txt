The electronic properties of transition bimetallics are determined mostly by the distribution of their d electrons and the interplay between d and non-d (s,p) conduction bands [lO,ll].

Bimetallic systems (thin films and alloys) are important catalysts for hydrocarbon reactions. Their selectivity and activity may be tuned by changing concentrations, exposed crystallographic faces and thermal treatment [l-4].

Despite their importance, the experimental data on these systems is rather scarce, and even general trends across the periodic table have not yet been established [5].

Bimetallic systems are rather complex and their experimental description requires a multi-technique approach to obtain information on electronic structure, geometry and defects, as well as adsorption and dissolution energies. Soft X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (SXPS) is a particularly suitable technique for characterization of the electronic properties of such materials.

The electronic structure of palladium has been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies [11,25].

The content of tungsten in the overlayer alloy increases with annealing temperature; up to 850 K, the tungsten alloy peak remains at fixed position but its intensity increases. This indicates that there is a single chemical state of W atoms in the Pd lattice.

Inspection of the Pd-W alloy phase diagram [23] reveals that the solubility of Pd in a solid W host is rather insignificant: below 2at.B. On the other hand, W shows significant solubility in a Pd host. The solubility limit is about 22 at.% and is nearly independent of temperature.

Valence band spectra for 5 ML Pd/W(211) are presented in Fig. .9a. Both the as dosed and the annealed films (to 700 K) exhibit an intense peak just below the Fermi level and a broader and less intense one about 3 eV below Ep. Upon annealing to 1050 K to form an alloy (annealing was done twice to check for saturation),a significant change appears. The intensity of the peak just below EF dramatically decreases.

Electronic structure of palladium has been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental studies [11,25].

A Pd-W model catalyst,composed of multilayer Pd supported by W(211), has shown greatly increased reactivity towards acetylene tricyclization when annealed to 1050K. This effect is attributed to the chemical activity of a W-Pd saturated alloy.

To characterize Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, researchers typically employ a multi-technique approach. This includes utilizing techniques such as soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS) for studying electronic properties, low energy electron diffraction (LEED) for examining the surface structure, and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) for understanding adsorption and desorption processes. These methods collectively offer a comprehensive view of the surfaces' structural, electronic, and chemical properties, essential for advancing our understanding in areas like advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Annealing of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces can significantly alter their electronic and chemical properties, impacting their catalytic activities. The specific mechanisms involved depend on factors such as the substrate type (single crystal or polycrystalline), the initial deposition method, and the annealing conditions (temperature, duration). The altered properties can lead to enhanced or suppressed catalytic behaviors, depending on the desired application.

The increased reactivity of a Pd-W model catalyst towards acetylene tricyclization when annealed to 1050K highlights the importance of surface chemistry and electronic structure in catalysis. The chemical activity of the W-Pd saturated alloy plays a crucial role in this increased reactivity, demonstrating the complex interplay between surface alloy formation and catalytic performance.

为了表征通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面，研究人员通常采用多技术方法。这包括使用软X射线光电谱（SXPS）研究电子性质，低能电子衍射（LEED）检查表面结构，以及温度程序脱附（TPD）理解吸附和解吸附过程。这些方法共同提供了对表面结构、电子和化学性质的全面了解，对于推进先进表面科学和催化研究领域至关重要。

对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行退火可以显著改变它们的电子和化学性质，影响其催化活性。涉及的具体机制取决于基质类型（单晶或多晶）、沉积方法和退火条件（温度、持续时间）。改变的性质可以导致催化行为的增强或抑制，具体取决于所需的应用。

当退火到1050K时，Pd-W模型催化剂对丙炔三环化反应的增强催化活性突显了表面化学和电子结构在催化中的重要性。W-Pd饱和合金的化学活性在这一增强催化性能中起着关键作用，表明表面合金形成与催化性能之间的复杂相互作用。
