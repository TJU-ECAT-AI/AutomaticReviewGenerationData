[1] "Bimetallic systems have drawn significant attention because of their interesting properties, which lead to applications in fields such as novel materials, catalysis, and microelectronics."
[2] "Despite their importance, the experimental data on these systems is rather scarce, and even general trends across the periodic table have not yet been established."
[3] "The admetals form pseudomorphic films on W(211). Single monolayers of these admetals are very stable against thermally activated rearrangement."
[4] "Thick (2-8 ML) films of Pd and Pt undergo alloying with the W substrate during annealing."
[5] "A Pd-W model catalyst, composed of multilayer Pd supported by W(211), has shown greatly increased reactivity towards acetylene tricyclization when annealed to 1050K. This effect is attributed to the chemical activity of a W-Pd saturated alloy."

1. Bimetallic systems attract considerable interest due to their unique properties, which find application in areas like innovative materials, catalysis, and microelectronics.
2. There is a scarcity of experimental data on bimetallic systems, and there is no established pattern across the periodic table.
3. Monolayers of admetals on W(211) are highly resistant to thermal rearrangement, thanks to their pseudomorphic nature and strong chemical interactions.
4. During annealing, thick films of Pd and Pt alloy with the W substrate.
5. An enhanced reactivity of acetylene tricyclization on a Pd-W catalyst, preheated to 1050K, is attributed to the chemical activity of a saturated alloy at the interface.

1. 双金属体系因其独特的性质而受到广泛关注，这些性质在新型材料、催化和微电子等领域有应用。
2. 这些系统的实验数据相对较少，而且周期表上的普遍趋势尚未建立。
3. 在W(211)上形成的单层admetals对热激活重排非常稳定，这是由于它们的拟同性结构和强烈的化学相互作用。
4. 在退火过程中，Pd和Pt厚薄膜与W基体合金化。
5. 预热至1050K的Pd-W催化剂在三环化乙炔反应中的活性增强，这归因于界面处饱和合金的化学活性。
