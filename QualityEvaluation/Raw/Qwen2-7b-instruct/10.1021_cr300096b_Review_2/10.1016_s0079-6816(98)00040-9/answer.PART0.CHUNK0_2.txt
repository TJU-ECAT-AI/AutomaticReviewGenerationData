The metal film growth and evolution during annealing has been investigated for coverages ranging from 0 to 8 monolayers. The films grow initially in a layer-by-layer mode at 300K. LEED, Auger, and Surface Core Level Shift (SCLS) measurements reveal that for coverages of one monolayer, the films are stable up to temperatures at which desorption occurs. In contrast, at higher coverages, SCLS data indicate that surface alloys are formed upon annealing films of Pt and Pd; surface alloy formation is not seen for Au overlayers. These findings are discussed in terms of structural and electronic properties of these bimetallic systems.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the structural models, DFT calculations, and the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the field of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The stability of the monolayer and the formation of alloys at higher coverages are key aspects discussed in the literature.
