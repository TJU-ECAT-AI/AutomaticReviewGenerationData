<p>Despite their importance, the experimental data on these systems is rather scarce, and even general trends across the periodic table have not yet been established.</p>
<p>Soft X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (SXPS) is a particularly suitable technique for characterization of the electronic properties of such materials.</p>
<p>The measurements include soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation, Auger electron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and thermal desorption spectroscopy.</p>
<p>The only absolute technique employed in this work for determining surface coverage is the measurement using the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM).</p>
<p>In the present work, we study transition and noble metals (Pd, Pt, Au) on a tungsten (211) substrate.</p>

<p>For deposition of Pt onto W(211) at 300 K, the Auger peak-to-peak amplitude has been measured as a function of deposition time.</p>
<p>The remaining LEED patterns in Fig. 3 are discussed below.</p>
<p>TPD spectroscopy provides insights into the overlayer coverages and desorption energies.</p>
<p>By looking at the sample with SXPS (cf. Figs. 2 and 5), one can study the adsorption and desorption of Pd from the perspective of the W surface.</p>
<p>The sequences of LEED images (cf. Fig. 3a to 3c and 3d to 3f), taken for N 2 ML films of Pd and Pt, show that the pseudomorphic structure of the overlayers is not changed by thermal treatment.</p>
<p>Similar to the AES results, photoelectron spectroscopy shows evidence for stable single monolayer films.</p>
<p>As shown in Fig. 6 and discussed above, there are considerable changes in AES intensities for multilayer films, at temperatures well below the onset of desorption.</p>
<p>We also find that a new feature appears in SXPS spectra when multilayer Pd or Pt films are annealed above N 700K (cf. Fig. 7).</p>

<p>For temperatures below 1100 K for palladium, and 1700 K for platinum, the desorption rate is insignificant.</p>
<p>The content of tungsten in the overlayer alloy increases with annealing temperature; up to 850 K, the tungsten alloy peak remains at fixed position but its intensity increases.</p>
<p>For platinum, the overall character of the phase diagram is similar, but the solubility limit for W in a Pt host is about 60 at. %.</p>
<p>Independent studies show that a Pd (Pt) monolayer film remains on the outer surface to cover the surface alloy.</p>
<p>Valence band spectra for 5 ML Pd/W(211) are presented in Fig. .9a.</p>
<p>The lower desorption temperatures of benzene (150 K, 180 K, and 270 K) and the five-fold increased benzene yields on the 1050K preannealed 6 ML Pd/W(211) surface, apparently result from the Pd-W alloy formed at the Pd/W interface.</p>
