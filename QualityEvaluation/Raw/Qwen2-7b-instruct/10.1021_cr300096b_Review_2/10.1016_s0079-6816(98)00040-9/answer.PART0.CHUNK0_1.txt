To characterize Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, researchers employ a suite of techniques including soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS), Auger electron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and thermal desorption spectroscopy. These methodologies enable the acquisition of comprehensive information regarding the electronic structure, geometry, defects, adsorption and dissolution energies, and chemical composition of the bimetallic surfaces. The utilization of high-resolution synchrotron radiation as an excitation source facilitates the measurement of subtle effects such as surface and interface core level shifts, which are critical for understanding the electronic properties of these materials. This characterization process is pivotal for elucidating the structural and electronic characteristics of bimetallic surfaces, thereby advancing our knowledge in areas such as catalysis and materials science. The enhanced chemical activity observed in the annealed Pd/W alloy surface for acetylene cyclization demonstrates the potential of these surfaces in catalytic applications, underscoring the significance of precise structural and electronic characterization in the development of advanced materials and catalysts.
