[1] "Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is one of the few techniques which is able to get site-selective quantitative information."
[2] "This is because most surface science techniques are not suitable for site-selective quantitative composition measurements."
[3] "The experiments were performed on a vicinal Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface which was found to have double atomic height steps."
[4] "We will use the term step edge for the atoms that have six missing nearest neighbours (solid black atoms in Fig. 1 )."
[5] "The average surface composition of a (4 1 0) crystal can be measured at an angle of incidence of about 30 (45 minus the miscut angle with respect to the [1 0 0]), as shown in Fig. 1c ."
[6] "The measured surface composition as a function of temperature, at a certain combination of Δϵ and , is calculated from since there is one step-edge atom per eight atoms at the surface."
[7] "The best results are obtained when the bond energy at the step edges is 70% larger than for the bulk, Δϵ=3.4 kJ/mol and kJ/mol."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The focus is on obtaining site-selective quantitative information, which is a capability that scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) provides, unlike many other surface science techniques.
3. The experiments specifically utilized a vicinal Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface with double atomic height steps for studying the step-edge composition.
4. The term "step edge" refers to the atoms with six missing nearest neighbors, distinguishing them from terrace atoms which have three to five missing neighbors.
5. The average surface composition can be measured at an angle of incidence of about 30 degrees, as depicted in Fig. 1c.
6. The surface composition as a function of temperature is calculated using the broken bond model, taking into account the number of step-edge atoms present.
7. The best results were achieved when the bond energy at the step edges was 70% larger than for the bulk, with Δϵ set to 3.4 kJ/mol and kJ/mol.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层进行。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的理解至关重要，在先进的表面科学和催化研究中。
2. 焦点在于获得选择性定量信息，这是扫描隧道显微镜（STM）能够提供的，而许多其他表面科学技术则不具备这一能力。
3. 特定利用了具有双原子高度台阶的Pt25Rh75(4 1 0)表面来研究台阶边的组成。
4. “台阶边”一词指的是拥有六个缺失最近邻原子的原子，与具有三到五个缺失最近邻原子的平台原子相区别。
5. 平均表面组成可以在大约30度的入射角下测量，如图1c所示。
6. 表面组成随温度变化的计算使用断裂键模型，考虑了表面中的台阶边原子数量。
7. 最佳结果是在台阶边的键能比基体高70%时得到的，设置Δϵ为3.4 kJ/mol和kJ/mol。
