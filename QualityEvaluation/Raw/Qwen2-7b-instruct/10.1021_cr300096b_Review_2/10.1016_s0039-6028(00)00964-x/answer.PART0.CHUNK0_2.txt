[1] "Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is one of the few techniques which is able to get site-selective quantitative information."
[2] "By combining these measurements with ion trajectory simulations we have extracted quantitative information concerning the step-edge composition."
[3] "The experiments were performed on a vicinal Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface which was found to have double atomic height steps."
[4] "This technique has been applied to the Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface in the temperature range between 400C and 700C."
[5] "The experiments reveal a much stronger Pt enrichment of the step edges than at the terrace sites."
[6] "By comparing the TOF and EARISS results, the relative sensitivity factors for Pt and Rh have been calculated and used to quantify the results of the step-edge measurements."
[7] "The main advantage over full three-dimensional trajectory calculations is the larger efficiency, and thus shorter simulation time."
[8] "The step-edge concentration as a function of temperature has been plotted in Fig. 6."
[9] "Clearly, the step edge is much stronger enriched in Pt than the terrace."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. It allows researchers to tailor the surface properties for applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research, ensuring that the surfaces have the desired functionalities for specific reactions or processes.
