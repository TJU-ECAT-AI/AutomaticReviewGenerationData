Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. By performing site-specific composition measurements using ion scattering techniques, researchers can gather quantitative information about the step-edge and terrace compositions across a wide temperature range. This approach reveals significant differences in composition between step edges and terraces, which are larger than those predicted by simple segregation models based on bond breaking. The use of ion trajectory simulations further aids in extracting detailed insights into the step-edge composition. Additionally, employing focusing effects inherent to ion scattering allows for precise measurements on vicinal Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surfaces with double atomic height steps, facilitating a deeper understanding of the bimetallic system's behavior under varying conditions.

<p>Vicinal surfaces of metal single crystals can display a distinctly different behaviour compared to their flat counterparts. Among the properties influenced by steps and other surface defects are adsorption [1] ,[2] ,[3] reactivity [4] , catalytic activity [5] and the work function of the surface [6] . For stepped surfaces of alloys an additional complication arises due to the fact that the step-edge composition of an alloy will in general differ from both the average surface composition and the bulk composition as a result of the lower coordination of the step-edge atoms.</p>
<p>Employing the shadowing and focusing effects inherent to ion scattering, it is possible to perform site-specific composition measurements on single crystal surfaces over a wide temperature range. By combining these measurements with ion trajectory simulations we have extracted quantitative information concerning the step-edge composition.</p>
<p>The experiments were performed on a vicinal Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surface which was found to have double atomic height steps. A schematic picture of this surface is given in Fig. 1 . We will use the term step edge for the atoms that have six missing nearest neighbours (solid black atoms in Fig. 1 ). A terrace atom is defined by three to five missing nearest neighbours (striped atoms in Fig. 1 ).</p>
<p>To understand the difference in properties between flat and stepped alloy surfaces, it is therefore necessary to know the composition of the surface and the step edges.</p>
<p>Until now, few experimental studies on the step-edge composition of bimetallic alloys have been reported. This is because most surface science techniques are not suitable for site-selective quantitative composition measurements. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is one of the few techniques which is able to get site-selective quantitative information. STM has been used to show that the step edge of a Pt50Rh50(1 0 0) surface consists almost exclusively of Pt [7] . However, besides the fact that an additional surface science technique is required to interpret the results, it also cannot be used at the high temperatures which are often needed to reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) is capable of providing quantitative information on the composition and structure of surfaces [8] ,[9] . In previous segregation studies on alloys, LEIS was mostly used to determine the composition of the outermost layer, averaged over all sites present.</p>
<p>In this paper we take this idea one step further by using focusing effects to distinguish step-edge sites from terrace sites, which enables us to measure the temperature-dependent composition of step edges for the first time.</p>
<p>Our temperature dependent measurements on Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) show a Pt enrichment which is in agreement with previous results on (1 1 1) and (1 0 0) surfaces of PtRh alloys as have been studied by several groups with various techniques including AES, ISS, atom probe FIM and STM.</p>
