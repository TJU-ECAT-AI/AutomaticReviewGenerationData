Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. By performing site-specific composition measurements using ion scattering techniques, researchers can gather quantitative information about the step-edge and terrace compositions across a wide temperature range. This approach reveals significant differences in composition between step edges and terraces, which are larger than those predicted by simple segregation models based on bond breaking. The use of ion trajectory simulations further aids in extracting detailed insights into the step-edge composition. Additionally, employing focusing effects inherent to ion scattering allows for precise measurements on vicinal Pt25Rh75(4 1 0) surfaces with double atomic height steps, facilitating a deeper understanding of the bimetallic system's behavior under varying conditions.
