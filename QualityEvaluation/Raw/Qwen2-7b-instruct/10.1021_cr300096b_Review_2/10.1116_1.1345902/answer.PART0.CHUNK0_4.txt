[1] "Both oxidized surface alloys form a SnO x overlayer that wets the substrate."
[2] "The SnO x film does not completely cover the surface for the oxidized (2×2) surface alloy."
[3] "For the oxidized (3×3)R30 surface alloy, an ordered (4×4) LEED pattern is formed upon flash annealing above 900 K."
[4] "The formation of this ordered SnO x adlayer coincides with Sn segregation from the bulk to the interface region."
[5] "The SnO x overlayer formed by oxidation of the (2×2) surface alloy is significantly less thermally stable than the oxidized (3×3)R30 surface alloy."
[6] "Exothermic alloying of Sn with Pt may facilitate the decomposition of the oxide overlayers."
[7] "Differences in the amount of subsurface tin and its segregation to the surface is proposed to explain the thermal stabilities of the oxide layers."
[8] "The incompleteness of the SnO x overlayer and less subsurface tin for the oxidized (2×2) surface alloy is proposed to explain its significant lower thermal stability."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By examining the evolution of the surface morphology with annealing temperature through techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, researchers can understand how the surface structure changes and how the materials interact under different conditions. This detailed analysis allows for the prediction of material behavior and performance in various applications, including catalysis, where surface properties play a critical role in determining efficiency and selectivity.
