[1] "Both oxidized surface alloys form a SnO x overlayer that wets the substrate."
[2] "The SnO x film does not completely cover the surface for the oxidized (2×2) surface alloy."
[3] "For the oxidized (3×3)R30 surface alloy, an ordered (4×4) LEED pattern is formed upon flash annealing above 900 K."
[4] "The formation of this ordered SnO x adlayer coincides with Sn segregation from the bulk to the interface region."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves oxidizing the surface alloys with NO2 exposure at 400 K under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to observe the evolution of the surface morphology with annealing temperature through techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These techniques provide insights into the formation of SnOx overlayers that wet the substrate, the differences in the thermodynamic stability of the oxide layers, and the role of exothermic alloying of Sn with Pt in facilitating the decomposition of the oxide overlayers. The variations in the amount of subsurface tin and its segregation to the surface are proposed to explain the thermal stabilities of the oxide layers, which is essential for understanding the behavior of these surfaces under different conditions.
