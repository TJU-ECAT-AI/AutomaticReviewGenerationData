The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves oxidizing the surface alloys with NO2 exposure at 400 K under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to observe the evolution of the surface morphology with annealing temperature through techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These techniques provide insights into the formation of SnOx overlayers that wet the substrate, the differences in the thermodynamic stability of the oxide layers, and the role of exothermic alloying of Sn with Pt in facilitating the decomposition of the oxide overlayers. The variations in the amount of subsurface tin and its segregation to the surface are proposed to explain the thermal stabilities of the oxide layers, which is essential for understanding the behavior of these surfaces under different conditions.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积一层Ni单层来合成，涉及将表面合金暴露于400 K的超高真空条件下用NO2氧化。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下深入了解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许研究人员通过低能电子衍射（LEED）、扫描隧道显微镜、Auger电子能谱和X射线光电子能谱等技术观察随退火温度变化的表面形态演化。这些技术提供了有关形成接触基底的SnOx覆盖层的信息，不同氧化层的热动力学稳定性差异，以及Sn与Pt的放热合金化在促进氧化层分解中的作用。提出的不同于2×2表面合金中表面下锡的量及其向表面的扩散是解释氧化层热稳定性的关键因素，这对于理解在不同条件下的表面行为至关重要。
