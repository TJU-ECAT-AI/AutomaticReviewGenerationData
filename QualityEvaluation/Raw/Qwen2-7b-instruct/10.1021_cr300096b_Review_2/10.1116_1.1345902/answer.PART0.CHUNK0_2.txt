The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves the use of low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows researchers to analyze the surface morphology, chemical composition, and bonding state of the materials. By understanding these properties, scientists can predict and optimize the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces in various applications, such as catalysis and surface science research.
