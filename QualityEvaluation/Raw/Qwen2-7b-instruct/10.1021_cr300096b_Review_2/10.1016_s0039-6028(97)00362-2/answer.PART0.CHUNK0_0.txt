[1] "The growth of A1 films on Pt(lll) is kinetically controlled at both 160 K and 300 K. In the submonolayer regime the rates of A1 terrace diffusion are higher than for diffusion about the perime- ter of adsorbate islands at both substrate temperatures, resulting in formation of 2D den- dritic islands."
[2] "In contrast, photoemission data show that, at 300 K,deposition of second-layer A1 induces significant adatom place exchange with the underlying Pt."
[3] "The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically stable bulk phase."
[4] "An interesting linear correlation between the composition and associated core-level shifts of various Al-noble metal alloys is found. The 300 K Pt/A1 interfacial alloy assigned to PtzA13 is in quantitative accord with this correlation."

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The growth morphology and electronic properties of these surfaces are investigated using techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This process is crucial for structural modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations because it allows researchers to understand the detailed structure of the bimetallic surface. This understanding is essential for predicting the electronic and chemical properties of the surface, which in turn impacts the performance of catalytic reactions and other surface-related applications. The characterization provides insights into how the two metals interact at the interface, which affects the catalytic activity and stability of the surface.

如何通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来表征Ni/Pt双金属表面，并且这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要？

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这些表面的生长形态和电子性质通过扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和Auger电子能谱（AES）等技术进行研究。这个过程对于结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够了解双金属表面的详细结构。这种理解对于预测表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，这反过来又影响催化反应和其他表面相关应用的性能。表征提供了关于两种金属在界面相互作用的信息，这影响了表面的催化活性和稳定性。
