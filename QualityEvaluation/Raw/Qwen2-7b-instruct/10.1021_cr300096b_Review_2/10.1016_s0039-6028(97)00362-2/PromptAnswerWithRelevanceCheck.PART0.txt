[1] "The growth of A1 films on Pt(lll) is kinetically controlled at both 160 K and 300 K. In the submonolayer regime the rates of A1 terrace diffusion are higher than for diffusion about the perime- ter of adsorbate islands at both substrate temperatures, resulting in formation of 2D den- dritic islands."
[2] "In contrast, photoemission data show that, at 300 K,deposition of second-layer A1 induces significant adatom place exchange with the underlying Pt."
[3] "The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically stable bulk phase."
[4] "An interesting linear correlation between the composition and associated core-level shifts of various Al-noble metal alloys is found. The 300 K Pt/A1 interfacial alloy assigned to PtzA13 is in quantitative accord with this correlation."

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The growth morphology and electronic properties of these surfaces are investigated using techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This process is crucial for structural modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations because it allows researchers to understand the detailed structure of the bimetallic surface. This understanding is essential for predicting the electronic and chemical properties of the surface, which in turn impacts the performance of catalytic reactions and other surface-related applications. The characterization provides insights into how the two metals interact at the interface, which affects the catalytic activity and stability of the surface.

[1] "Our earlier work on the Pt(lll)/A1Ox model planar system under UHV conditions [18] provided fundamentally useful insight regarding the effect of SO2 in promoting alkane oxidation over dispersed Pt/alumina catalysts [19]."
[2] "The properties of the Pt/A1 interface are therefore of interest, yet, surprisingly, there have been no previous model studies using single crystal substrates."
[3] "The Auger uptake data presented in Fig. 1 indicate that growth of A1 on Pt(lll) is kinetically controlled."
[4] "Furthermore, our STM measurements show no evidence for agglomeration of thick A1 deposits, and consequent re-exposure of the substrate, at elevated temperatures."
[5] "Quantitative analysis of the Pt Auger data gives additional insight into the A1 growth mode."
[6] "These observations suggest that, at 300 K, extended continuous place-exchange of the two components occurs."
[7] "The direction and magnitude of the 300 K XP core-level shifts and the corresponding evolution of the valence-band structure are consistent with Pt/A1 alloy formation."
[8] "An interesting linear correlation between the composition and associated core-level shifts of various Al-noble metal alloys is found. The 300 K Pt/A1 interfacial alloy assigned to PtzA13 is in quantitative accord with this correlation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The key steps include observing the growth morphology, electronic properties, and interfacial alloy formation, particularly focusing on the balance between surface energy and free energy of alloy formation. The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically stable bulk phase, providing insights into the composition and associated core-level shifts that align with a linear correlation observed across various Al-noble metal alloys.
