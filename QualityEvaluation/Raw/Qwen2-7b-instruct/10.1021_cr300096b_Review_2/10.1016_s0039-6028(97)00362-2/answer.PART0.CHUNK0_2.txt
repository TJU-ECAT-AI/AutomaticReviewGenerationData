[1] "Our earlier work on the Pt(lll)/A1Ox model planar system under UHV conditions [18] provided fundamentally useful insight regarding the effect of SO2 in promoting alkane oxidation over dispersed Pt/alumina catalysts [19]."
[2] "The properties of the Pt/A1 interface are therefore of interest, yet, surprisingly, there have been no previous model studies using single crystal substrates."
[3] "The growth of A1 on Pt(lll) is kinetically controlled."
[4] "In the submonolayer regime the rates of A1 terrace diffusion are higher than for diffusion about the perime- ter of adsorbate islands at both substrate temperatures, resulting in formation of 2D dendritic islands."
[5] "A1 films continue to grow in a layer-by-layer fashion on Pt(lll) for >5 ML at 160 K without evidence for any significant Pt/A1 intermixing."
[6] "At 300 K, deposition of second-layer A1 induces significant adatom place exchange with the underlying Pt."
[7] "The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically stable bulk phase."
[8] "An interesting linear correlation between the composition and associated core-level shifts of various Al-noble metal alloys is found."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface composition and structure. By examining how the properties change with different compositions, researchers can gain insights into how the bimetallic surfaces behave under various conditions, which is essential for developing new catalysts and enhancing existing ones. The characterization techniques used, such as XPS and STM, provide detailed information about the electronic and chemical states of the surfaces, enabling a deeper understanding of their catalytic activities.
