[1] "The growth of A1 films on Pt(lll) is kinetically controlled at both 160 K and 300 K."
[2] "In the submonolayer regime the rates of A1 terrace diffusion are higher than for diffusion about the perime- ter of adsorbate islands at both substrate temperatures, resulting in formation of 2D den- dritic islands."
[3] "A1 films continue to grow in a layer-by-layer fashion on Pt(lll) for >5 ML at 160 K without evidence for any significant Pt/A1 intermixing."
[4] "At 300 K, deposition of second-layer A1 induces significant adatom place exchange with the underlying Pt."
[5] "The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically stable bulk phase."
[6] "An interesting linear correlation between the composition and associated core-level shifts of various Al-noble metal alloys is found."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
