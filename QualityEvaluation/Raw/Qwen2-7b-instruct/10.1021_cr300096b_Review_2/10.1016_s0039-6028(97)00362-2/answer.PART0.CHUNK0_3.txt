[1] "The growth of A1 films on Pt(lll) is kinetically controlled at both 160 K and 300 K."
[2] "In the submonolayer regime the rates of A1 terrace diffusion are higher than for diffusion about the perime- ter of adsorbate islands at both substrate temperatures, resulting in formation of 2D den- dritic islands."
[3] "A1 films continue to grow in a layer-by-layer fashion on Pt(lll) for >5 ML at 160 K without evidence for any significant Pt/A1 intermixing."
[4] "At 300 K, deposition of second-layer A1 induces significant adatom place exchange with the underlying Pt."
[5] "The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically stable bulk phase."
[6] "An interesting linear correlation between the composition and associated core-level shifts of various Al-noble metal alloys is found."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for detailed structural modeling and DFT calculations, providing insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The understanding gained from these analyses is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research.
