[1] "Our earlier work on the Pt(lll)/A1Ox model planar system under UHV conditions [18] provided fundamentally useful insight regarding the effect of SO2 in promoting alkane oxidation over dispersed Pt/alumina catalysts [19]."
[2] "The properties of the Pt/A1 interface are therefore of interest, yet, surprisingly, there have been no previous model studies using single crystal substrates."
[3] "The Auger uptake data presented in Fig. 1 indicate that growth of A1 on Pt(lll) is kinetically controlled."
[4] "Furthermore, our STM measurements show no evidence for agglomeration of thick A1 deposits, and consequent re-exposure of the substrate, at elevated temperatures."
[5] "Quantitative analysis of the Pt Auger data gives additional insight into the A1 growth mode."
[6] "These observations suggest that, at 300 K, extended continuous place-exchange of the two components occurs."
[7] "The direction and magnitude of the 300 K XP core-level shifts and the corresponding evolution of the valence-band structure are consistent with Pt/A1 alloy formation."
[8] "An interesting linear correlation between the composition and associated core-level shifts of various Al-noble metal alloys is found. The 300 K Pt/A1 interfacial alloy assigned to PtzA13 is in quantitative accord with this correlation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The key steps include observing the growth morphology, electronic properties, and interfacial alloy formation, particularly focusing on the balance between surface energy and free energy of alloy formation. The interfacial alloy formed corresponds to PtzA13, which is also the most thermodynamically stable bulk phase, providing insights into the composition and associated core-level shifts that align with a linear correlation observed across various Al-noble metal alloys.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。关键步骤包括观察生长形态、电子性质和界面合金形成，特别是关注表面能量与合金形成自由能之间的平衡。形成的界面合金对应于PtzA13，这也是最热力学稳定的固态相，提供有关组成及其相关核心级位移的信息，这与各种Al-贵金属合金中观察到的线性相关性一致。
