[1] "A systematic study of ultrathin metal films of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au on W(111) has been carried out by SXPS."
[2] "It is found that a correlation exists between the interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energy and the corresponding heat of adsorption of metal films on W(111): metal films on W(111) with high heats of adsorption have higher interfacial W4fv/2 binding energies, and metal films on W(Ill) with lower heats of adsorption have smaller interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energies."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. The high-resolution W 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra obtained immediately after deposition at 100 K provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. Non-linear least-squares fitting methods are employed to analyze the spectra, aiding in the detailed understanding of the interactions between the Ni and Pt layers.
