The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. The high-resolution W 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra obtained immediately after deposition at 100 K provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. Non-linear least-squares fitting methods are employed to analyze the spectra, aiding in the detailed understanding of the interactions between the Ni and Pt layers.
