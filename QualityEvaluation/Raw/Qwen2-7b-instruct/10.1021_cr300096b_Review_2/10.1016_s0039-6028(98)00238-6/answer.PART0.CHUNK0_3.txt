[1] "By tuning the photon energy to select the appropriate kinetic energies of the emitted photon-excited electrons (i.e. taking advantage of the short inelastic mean free path of electrons in solids), it is possible to increase the sensitivity to the near-surface region."
[2] "The W 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra were taken immediately after the deposition of metal films at 100 K. No faceting of the W(111 ) substrate takes place at this temperature, and the W(lll) substrate remains planar [1-4]."
[3] "Each metal film studied using low-energy electron diffraction was observed to grow pseudomorphically on W(lll)."
[4] "These procedures are discussed in detail elsewhere [10]."
[5] "In these studies, a non-linear least-squares fitting was applied to the W 4f7/2 photoemission spectrum by assuming that."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates at 100 K. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The process of depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates allows for increased sensitivity to the near-surface region through the tuning of photon energy, enhancing the characterization of the bimetallic surfaces.
3. The W 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra of the bimetallic surfaces are taken immediately after the deposition of metal films at 100 K, ensuring that the W(111) substrate remains planar and facilitating accurate characterization of the surfaces.
4. Detailed procedures for the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces are discussed in other literature [10].
5. Non-linear least-squares fitting is applied to the W 4f7/2 photoemission spectrum to analyze the electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces.
