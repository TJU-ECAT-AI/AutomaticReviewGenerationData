[1] "A systematic study of ultrathin metal films of K, Co, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag and Au on W(111) has been carried out by SXPS."
[2] "It is found that a correlation exists between the interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energy and the corresponding heat of adsorption of metal films on W(111): metal films on W(111) with high heats of adsorption have higher interfacial W4fv/2 binding energies, and metal films on W(Ill) with lower heats of adsorption have smaller interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energies."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it helps in understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The correlation between the interfacial W 4f7/2 binding energy and the heat of adsorption of metal films on W(111) provides insights into the electronic properties of the bimetallic systems.
