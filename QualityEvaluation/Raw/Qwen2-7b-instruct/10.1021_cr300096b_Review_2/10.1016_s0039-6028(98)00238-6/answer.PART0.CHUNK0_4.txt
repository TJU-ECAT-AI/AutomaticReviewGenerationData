The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition is carried out at 100 K to prevent any faceting of the W(111) substrate, ensuring the surface remains planar. High-resolution W 4f7/2 core-level photoemission spectra are taken immediately after deposition at 75 eV photon energy, providing insights into the surface region's properties. These procedures are detailed in the referenced literature for further understanding.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。沉积在100 K下进行，以防止W(111)基底发生任何晶面化，确保表面保持平坦状态。高分辨率的W 4f7/2核心能级光发射谱在75 eV光子能量下立即在100 K下测量，提供了有关表面区域性质的见解。这些程序在引用的文献中详细描述，以供进一步了解。
