[1] "All electrodes in this study (denoted Pd*/X) consisted of a pure,pseudomorphic monolayer of Pd on the close-packed surfaces of various substrate metals X; the (111) facets were used for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals, and the (0001) surfaces were used for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals."
[2] "We modeled the latter as a Pt skin on a Pt-depleted subsurface layer (a Pt coverage of 0.25 ML was used in this layer) with a terminal substrate layer of the bulk composition."
[3] "Simple voltammetric scans into the hydrogen evolution region at 5 mVs−1 were performed after checking for surface quality and cleanliness in 0.1M H2SO4 by cyclic voltammetry at room temperature."
[4] "The potentials were measured against a saturated calomel electrode and corrected for the solution resistance."
[5] "Data for overpotentials h<0.15 V were fitted to the cathodic term of a ButlerVolmer-type equation to obtain experimental values for the exchange-current densities."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The (111) facets are utilized for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals, while the (0001) surfaces are used for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals. The Pt surface is modeled as a skin on a depleted subsurface layer with a Pt coverage of 0.25 ML in this layer. The substrates are prepared by inductive annealing and cooling to ensure atomically clean and well-ordered surfaces. Cyclic voltammetry is performed in 0.1M H2SO4 to check surface quality and cleanliness at room temperature. Voltammetric scans are conducted at 5 mVs−1 into the hydrogen evolution region. Potentials are measured against a saturated calomel electrode and corrected for solution resistance. Overpotentials less than 0.15 V are fitted to the cathodic term of a ButlerVolmer-type equation to obtain experimental values for the exchange-current densities.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。对于面心立方（fcc）金属，使用（111）晶面；对于六角紧密堆积（hcp）金属，则使用（0001）表面。将Pt表面视为一层覆盖率为0.25 ML的Pt皮肤，位于该层之下。通过感应退火和冷却准备基板，以获得原子级清洁且有序的表面。在0.1M H2SO4中进行循环伏安法，检查室温下的表面质量和清洁度。在5 mVs−1下对氢演化区域进行伏安扫描。测量电位时采用饱和甘汞电极，并对溶液电阻进行校正。对于小于0.15 V的过电势，将数据拟合到ButlerVolmer型方程的阴极项，以获得交换电流密度的实验值。
