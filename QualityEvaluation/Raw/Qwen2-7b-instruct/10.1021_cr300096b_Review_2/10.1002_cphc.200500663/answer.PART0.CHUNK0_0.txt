[1] "All electrodes in this study (denoted Pd*/X) consisted of a pure,pseudomorphic monolayer of Pd on the close-packed surfaces of various substrate metals X; the (111) facets were used for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals, and the (0001) surfaces were used for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals."
[2] "The system Pd*/PtRu was simply a pure Pd overlayer on the stable, surface-segregated PtRu (1:1) alloy. We modeled the latter as a Pt skin on a Pt-depleted subsurface layer (a Pt coverage of 0.25 ML was used in this layer) with a terminal substrate layer of the bulk composition."
[3] "All substrate electrodes under study were prepared by inductive annealing and cooling in such a way that atomically clean and well-ordered surfaces were obtained. The Pt50Ru50 (111) electrode was cooled in the presence of CO to give segregation of Pt to the surface."
[4] "Pd monolayers were prepared either by underpotential deposition (Au, Pt, Rh, PtRu) or by controlled dissolution of bulk Pd (Ru, Ir, Re)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties because it ensures the preparation of atomically clean and well-ordered surfaces. The method typically includes inductive annealing and cooling to achieve this state. For instance, the Pt50Ru50 (111) electrode is prepared by cooling in the presence of CO, leading to the segregation of Pt to the surface. Additionally, Pd monolayers can be synthesized through underpotential deposition on Au, Pt, Rh, PtRu substrates or by controlling the dissolution of bulk Pd on Ru, Ir, Re surfaces.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它确保了原子级清洁且有序的表面制备。该方法通常包括感应退火和冷却以达到这种状态。例如，Pt50Ru50（111）电极通过在CO的存在下冷却制备，导致Pt向表面的分离。此外，可以通过在Au、Pt、Rh、PtRu基底上的超电位沉积或控制溶解纯Pd在Ru、Ir、Re表面上来合成Pd单层。
