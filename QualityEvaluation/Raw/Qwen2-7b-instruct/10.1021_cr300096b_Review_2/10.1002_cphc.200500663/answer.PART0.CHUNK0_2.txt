[1] "All electrodes in this study (denoted Pd*/X) consisted of a pure,pseudomorphic monolayer of Pd on the close-packed surfaces of various substrate metals X; the (111) facets were used for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals, and the (0001) surfaces were used for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals."
[2] "We modeled the [Pt50Ru50 (111) electrode] as a Pt skin on a Pt-depleted subsurface layer (a Pt coverage of 0.25 ML was used in this layer) with a terminal substrate layer of the bulk composition."
[3] "All substrate electrodes under study were prepared by inductive annealing and cooling in such a way that atomically clean and well-ordered surfaces were obtained."
[4] "Simple voltammetric scans into the hydrogen evolution region at 5 mVs−1 were performed after checking for surface quality and cleanliness in 0.1M H2SO4 by cyclic voltammetry at room temperature."
[5] "Data for overpotentials h<0.15 V were fitted to the cathodic term of a ButlerVolmer-type equation to obtain experimental values for the exchange-current densities."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for precise control over the surface structure and composition of the bimetallic interface. Structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations require accurate representation of the surface to predict the electronic and chemical properties. By ensuring the surface is atomically clean and well-ordered through inductive annealing and cooling, researchers can better understand the interactions between Ni and Pt, leading to insights into catalytic activity and selectivity. Voltammetry is used to assess surface quality and cleanliness, while fitting data to the Butler-Volmer equation provides exchange-current densities necessary for comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程至关重要，因为它允许精确控制双金属界面的表面结构和组成。结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算需要准确表示表面，以预测电子和化学性质。通过确保表面是原子级清洁和有序，研究人员可以更好地理解Ni与Pt之间的相互作用，从而为催化活性和选择性提供见解。电位扫描用于评估表面质量和清洁度，而将数据拟合到Butler-Volmer方程的阴极项则提供了实验结果所需的交换电流密度，以便与理论预测进行比较。
