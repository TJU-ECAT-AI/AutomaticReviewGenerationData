[1] "All electrodes in this study (denoted Pd*/X) consisted of a pure,pseudomorphic monolayer of Pd on the close-packed surfaces of various substrate metals X; the (111) facets were used for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals, and the (0001) surfaces were used for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals."
[2] "The system Pd*/PtRu was simply a pure Pd overlayer on the stable, surface-segregated PtRu (1:1) alloy. We modeled the latter as a Pt skin on a Pt-depleted subsurface layer (a Pt coverage of 0.25 ML was used in this layer) with a terminal substrate layer of the bulk composition."
[3] "All substrate electrodes under study were prepared by inductive annealing and cooling in such a way that atomically clean and well-ordered surfaces were obtained. The Pt50Ru50 (111) electrode was cooled in the presence of CO to give segregation of Pt to the surface."
[4] "Pd monolayers were prepared either by underpotential deposition (Au, Pt, Rh, PtRu) or by controlled dissolution of bulk Pd (Ru, Ir, Re)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties because it ensures the preparation of atomically clean and well-ordered surfaces. The method typically includes inductive annealing and cooling to achieve this state. For instance, the Pt50Ru50 (111) electrode is prepared by cooling in the presence of CO, leading to the segregation of Pt to the surface. Additionally, Pd monolayers can be synthesized through underpotential deposition on Au, Pt, Rh, PtRu substrates or by controlling the dissolution of bulk Pd on Ru, Ir, Re surfaces.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it provides the structural foundation for conducting DFT calculations and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The deposited Ni monolayer interacts with the underlying Pt substrate, creating a composite structure that can exhibit unique properties compared to the individual components. The surfaces are then characterized through various techniques, including voltammetry, to assess their quality and cleanliness. The experimental values for the exchange-current densities are obtained by fitting the data to a Butler-Volmer-type equation, providing insights into the catalytic activity of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces in hydrogen evolution reactions.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for precise control over the surface structure and composition of the bimetallic interface. Structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations require accurate representation of the surface to predict the electronic and chemical properties. By ensuring the surface is atomically clean and well-ordered through inductive annealing and cooling, researchers can better understand the interactions between Ni and Pt, leading to insights into catalytic activity and selectivity. Voltammetry is used to assess surface quality and cleanliness, while fitting data to the Butler-Volmer equation provides exchange-current densities necessary for comparing theoretical predictions with experimental results.
