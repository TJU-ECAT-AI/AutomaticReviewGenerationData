The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it provides the structural foundation for conducting DFT calculations and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The deposited Ni monolayer interacts with the underlying Pt substrate, creating a composite structure that can exhibit unique properties compared to the individual components. The surfaces are then characterized through various techniques, including voltammetry, to assess their quality and cleanliness. The experimental values for the exchange-current densities are obtained by fitting the data to a Butler-Volmer-type equation, providing insights into the catalytic activity of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces in hydrogen evolution reactions.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基体上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程至关重要，因为它为进行DFT计算和理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质提供了结构基础。沉积的Ni单层与底层Pt基体相互作用，形成具有与单独成分不同特性的复合结构。然后通过各种技术对表面进行表征，以评估其质量和清洁度。通过将数据拟合到Butler-Volmer型方程的阴极项中，可以获得Ni/Pt双金属表面在氢演化反应中的电交换电流密度的实验值，从而提供有关催化活性的信息。
