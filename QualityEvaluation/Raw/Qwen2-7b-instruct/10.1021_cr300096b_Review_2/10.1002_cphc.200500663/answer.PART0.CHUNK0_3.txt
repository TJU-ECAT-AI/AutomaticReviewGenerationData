[1] "All electrodes in this study (denoted Pd*/X) consisted of a pure,pseudomorphic monolayer of Pd on the close-packed surfaces of various substrate metals X; the (111) facets were used for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals, and the (0001) surfaces were used for hexagonal close-packed (hcp) metals."
[2] "We modeled the [Pt50Ru50 (111)] electrode as a Pt skin on a Pt-depleted subsurface layer (a Pt coverage of 0.25 ML was used in this layer) with a terminal substrate layer of the bulk composition."
[3] "The system Pd*/PtRu was simply a pure Pd overlayer on the stable, surface-segregated PtRu (1:1) alloy."
[4] "The Pt50Ru50 (111) electrode was cooled in the presence of CO to give segregation of Pt to the surface."
[5] "Pd monolayers were prepared either by underpotential deposition (Au, Pt, Rh, PtRu) or by controlled dissolution of bulk Pd (Ru, Ir, Re)."
[6] "Simple voltammetric scans into the hydrogen evolution region at 5 mVs−1 were performed after checking for surface quality and cleanliness in 0.1M H2SO4 by cyclic voltammetry at room temperature."
[7] "Data for overpotentials <0.15 V were fitted to the cathodic term of a Butler-Volmer-type equation to obtain experimental values for the exchange-current densities."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to understand the precise arrangement of atoms at the interface, which influences the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. DFT calculations rely on accurate structural models to predict properties such as bond strengths, energy levels, and reactivity. Our comprehensive understanding of these properties is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research, particularly in developing more efficient catalysts for hydrogen evolution and other electrochemical processes.
