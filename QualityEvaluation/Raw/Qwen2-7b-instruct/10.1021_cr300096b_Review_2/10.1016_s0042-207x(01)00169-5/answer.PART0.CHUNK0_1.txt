[1] "Faceting and other morphological changes of surfaces caused by adsorbed thin films have been reported for a number of years for various adsorption systems and surface geometries, from planar single crystal surfaces to the nearly spherical surfaces of small particles and large crystals [1}11]."
[2] "Faceting is the spontaneous growth of a hill and valley structure on the surface during the heating of the crystal."
[3] "It is generally believed that faceting is driven by minimization of the surface free energy [9}12]."
[4] "The purpose of this paper is to provide additional information on the faceting and the final steady-state shape of the emitter tips covered by metals after high temperature cleaning."
[5] "Significant changes in the tip geometry follow dosing with Pt in excess of 1 ML: an increase in size of the 1 1 2 facets and decrease in size of the 1 1 0 faces."
[6] "Faceting was found to appear in the 1 1 1 zone for a Pt coverage about 1 ML after annealing in the temperature range 1000}1900 K."
[7] "The threshold temperatures are also similar. The most pronounced faceting is observed for a Pt/W emitter, and also the temperature at which faceting vanishes is the highest ('1600 K) for Pt/W."
[8] "The 1 1 0, 6 1 1 and 5 1 1 facets consist of close packed atom rows in the [1 1 0] direction with troughs between them."
[9] "This aspect will be taken into consideration in the next paper."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The results help in predicting the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces under different conditions and optimizing their performance in applications such as catalysis.
