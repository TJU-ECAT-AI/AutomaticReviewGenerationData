Faceting is a process where a hill and valley structure spontaneously forms on the crystal surface during heating. This is believed to minimize surface free energy. The study focuses on the faceting and final shape of emitter tips covered by metals after high-temperature cleaning. The adsorption of platinum (Pt) on tungsten (W), iridium (Ir), and palladium (Pd) on molybdenum (Mo) was observed under different thermal conditions. When the Pt coverage exceeds 1 ML, significant changes in the tip geometry occur, with the 1 1 2 facets increasing in size and the 1 1 0 faces decreasing. The Pt-induced faceting results in a transition from a hemispherical to a polyhedral shape of the emitter apex. The most pronounced faceting is observed in the Pt/W system, with the highest temperature at which faceting disappears being 1600 K. New facets form in the disordered region between the [1 1 0] and [1 1 2] directions for Pt/W and Pd/Mo systems. These facets are characterized by close-packed atomic rows with troughs between them. During annealing, tungsten atoms diffuse into the Pt overlayer, causing alloying.

晶面化是晶体表面在加热过程中自发形成山丘和山谷结构的过程。这通常被认为是通过最小化表面自由能来驱动的。这项研究关注的是在高温清洁后覆盖金属的发射尖端的晶面化和最终形状。在不同的热条件下观察到铂（Pt）在钨（W）、铱（Ir）和钯（Pd）在钼（Mo）上的吸附。当Pt覆盖率超过1 ML时，尖端几何形状会发生显著变化，1 1 2面的尺寸增加，1 1 0面的尺寸减小。Pt诱导的晶面化导致发射顶点从半球形转变为多面体形。在Pt/W系统中观察到最显著的晶面化，其中在晶面消失的最高温度为1600 K。对于Pt/W和Pd/Mo系统，在[1 1 0]和[1 1 2]方向之间的无序区域形成了新的晶面。这些晶面由紧密排列的原子行组成，行之间有凹槽。在退火过程中，钨原子扩散进入Pt过层，导致合金化。
