[1] "Faceting and other morphological changes of surfaces caused by adsorbed thin films have been reported for a number of years for various adsorption systems and surface geometries, from planar single crystal surfaces to the nearly spherical surfaces of small particles and large crystals [1}11]."
[2] "Faceting is driven by minimization of the surface free energy [9}12]."
[3] "Recently FEM has been used to study the facetting and steady-state shape of Rh- and Pd-covered W field emitter tips [20]."
[4] "The purpose of this paper is to provide additional information on the faceting and final steady-state shape of the emitter tips covered by metals after high temperature cleaning."
[5] "Typical FE patterns are presented in Fig. 1 which show various stages of the faceting process for these adsorption systems."
[6] "Significant changes in the tip geometry follow dosing with Pt in excess of 1 ML: an increase in size of the 1 1 2 facets and decrease in size of the 1 1 0 faces."
[7] "A comparison of patterns for the clean emitter (Fig. 1a) and the Pt covered emitter (Fig. 1d) indicates that the presence of adsorbed Pt atoms affects the thermal steady-state shape of the microcrystalline tungsten emitter apex: the apex passes from a nearly hemispherical form to a more polyhedral form."
[8] "Faceting was observed for coverage *1 ML in the substrate temperature range 750}1040K."
[9] "Interaction of Pt layers with the W and Ir tips and Pd layers with the Mo tip at elevated temperature leads to changes in the faceted morphology of the substrate."
[10] "Similar transitions are seen for the systems presented in this work."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It allows researchers to analyze how the presence of one metal influences the properties of the other, which is essential in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
