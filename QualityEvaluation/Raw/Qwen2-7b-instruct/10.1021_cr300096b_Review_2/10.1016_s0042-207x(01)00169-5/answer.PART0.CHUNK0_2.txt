3.1. Platinum covered tungsten
FE patterns, obtained during evaporation of platinum onto the tungsten emitter held at "1400 K, are shown in Fig. 1a}d. The cover- age "1 ML was identi"ed with the evaporation time of Pt corresponding to the maximum of the average work function of the system (see Section 4).

3.2. Palladium covered molybdenum
Fig. 1a}d shows FE patterns characteristic of the adsorption of Pd on the molybdenum tip at 970 K. At 1 ML coverage, 0 1 3 facets about 100 A s in diameter appear (1 0 0 zones), and are distinct- ly visible at higher coverage in Fig. 1c.

3.3. Platinum covered iridium
FE patterns for the adsorption of Pt atoms on the Ir emitter tip held at a temperature of "1130 K are presented in Fig. 1a}d. The pattern in Fig. 1a represents the FE image corresponding to the thermally cleaned Ir sample (without Pt).

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of field emission microscopy (FEM) allows for the detailed visualization of the surface morphology and the identification of the new facets that appear upon the adsorption of metals on the emitter surfaces, leading to a significant change in the tip geometry. This information is essential for the accurate modeling of the bimetallic surfaces and the prediction of their catalytic activity and stability.
