[1] "Faceting of planar surfaces on a massive scale is demonstrated as the appearance of new facets which form hills and valleys on initially large and flat crystallographic surfaces covered by thin metal films."
[2] "Faceting of curved surfaces, consisting of various faces, leads to an increase in facet size, i.e., increased angular width subtended by some faces."
[3] "Measurements for planar single crystal surfaces have shown that extensive faceting on W(1 1 1) and Mo(1 1 1) faces appears at a much higher coverage, namely at *3 geometrical ML, which is defined as one physical ML."
[4] "A 'eld emitter tip, after heating at high temperature (*0.4 ) for an extended time, assumes a steady-state shape. The surface is composed of ordered low-index faces and disordered regions."
[5] "The adsorption of Pt on W, Pt on Ir, and Pd on Mo field emitter surfaces is found to be accompanied by distinct rearrangement and faceting of the substrate surface. This results in a significant change in tip geometry: for coverage '1 ML and in the substrate temperature range &800}1400 K (depending on the adsorption system) the transition of the steady-state tip shape from a nearly hemispherical form to a more polyhedral one occurs."

Faceting of surfaces covered by thin metal films is demonstrated through the formation of new facets creating hills and valleys on initially flat crystallographic surfaces. Faceting on curved surfaces leads to an increase in facet size. Extensive faceting on W(1 1 1) and Mo(1 1 1) surfaces occurs at a higher coverage, specifically 3 geometrical ML. A field emitter tip, after being heated at high temperature for an extended period, achieves a steady-state shape composed of ordered low-index faces and disordered regions. The adsorption of Pt, Pd, and Ir on field emitter surfaces results in distinct rearrangement and faceting of the substrate surface, leading to a change in tip geometry from hemispherical to polyhedral for coverage '1 ML and within the temperature range 800}1400 K, depending on the adsorption system.

在薄金属薄膜覆盖的表面上，表面平滑的晶面通过形成新的凸起和山谷而发生晶面重构。弯曲表面上的晶面增大导致了晶面尺寸的增加。在W(1 1 1)和Mo(1 1 1)表面进行大量晶面重构发生在更高覆盖度下，即3个几何ML，相当于一个物理ML。经过长时间在高温下加热后，场发射体尖端达到稳定状态形状，由有序低指数面和无序区域组成。铂、钯和铱吸附在场发射体表面上，导致基底表面的显著重构和晶面化，尖端几何形状从半球形转变为多面体，覆盖度为'1 ML，在温度范围800}1400 K内，具体取决于吸附系统。
