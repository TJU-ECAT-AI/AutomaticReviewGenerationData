The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of field emission microscopy (FEM) allows for the detailed visualization of the surface morphology and the identification of the new facets that appear upon the adsorption of metals on the emitter surfaces, leading to a significant change in the tip geometry. This information is essential for the accurate modeling of the bimetallic surfaces and the prediction of their catalytic activity and stability.

[1] "Faceting of planar surfaces on a massive scale is demonstrated as the appearance of new facets which form hills and valleys on initially large and flat crystallographic surfaces covered by thin metal films."
[2] "Faceting of curved surfaces, consisting of various faces, leads to an increase in facet size, i.e., increased angular width subtended by some faces."
[3] "Measurements for planar single crystal surfaces have shown that extensive faceting on W(1 1 1) and Mo(1 1 1) faces appears at a much higher coverage, namely at *3 geometrical ML, which is defined as one physical ML."
[4] "A 'eld emitter tip, after heating at high temperature (*0.4 ) for an extended time, assumes a steady-state shape. The surface is composed of ordered low-index faces and disordered regions."
[5] "The adsorption of Pt on W, Pt on Ir, and Pd on Mo field emitter surfaces is found to be accompanied by distinct rearrangement and faceting of the substrate surface. This results in a significant change in tip geometry: for coverage '1 ML and in the substrate temperature range &800}1400 K (depending on the adsorption system) the transition of the steady-state tip shape from a nearly hemispherical form to a more polyhedral one occurs."

Faceting of surfaces covered by thin metal films is demonstrated through the formation of new facets creating hills and valleys on initially flat crystallographic surfaces. Faceting on curved surfaces leads to an increase in facet size. Extensive faceting on W(1 1 1) and Mo(1 1 1) surfaces occurs at a higher coverage, specifically 3 geometrical ML. A field emitter tip, after being heated at high temperature for an extended period, achieves a steady-state shape composed of ordered low-index faces and disordered regions. The adsorption of Pt, Pd, and Ir on field emitter surfaces results in distinct rearrangement and faceting of the substrate surface, leading to a change in tip geometry from hemispherical to polyhedral for coverage '1 ML and within the temperature range 800}1400 K, depending on the adsorption system.

Faceting is a process where a hill and valley structure spontaneously forms on the crystal surface during heating. This is believed to minimize surface free energy. The study focuses on the faceting and final shape of emitter tips covered by metals after high-temperature cleaning. The adsorption of platinum (Pt) on tungsten (W), iridium (Ir), and palladium (Pd) on molybdenum (Mo) was observed under different thermal conditions. When the Pt coverage exceeds 1 ML, significant changes in the tip geometry occur, with the 1 1 2 facets increasing in size and the 1 1 0 faces decreasing. The Pt-induced faceting results in a transition from a hemispherical to a polyhedral shape of the emitter apex. The most pronounced faceting is observed in the Pt/W system, with the highest temperature at which faceting disappears being 1600 K. New facets form in the disordered region between the [1 1 0] and [1 1 2] directions for Pt/W and Pd/Mo systems. These facets are characterized by close-packed atomic rows with troughs between them. During annealing, tungsten atoms diffuse into the Pt overlayer, causing alloying.

晶面化是晶体表面在加热过程中自发形成山丘和山谷结构的过程。这通常被认为是通过最小化表面自由能来驱动的。这项研究关注的是在高温清洁后覆盖金属的发射尖端的晶面化和最终形状。在不同的热条件下观察到铂（Pt）在钨（W）、铱（Ir）和钯（Pd）在钼（Mo）上的吸附。当Pt覆盖率超过1 ML时，尖端几何形状会发生显著变化，1 1 2面的尺寸增加，1 1 0面的尺寸减小。Pt诱导的晶面化导致发射顶点从半球形转变为多面体形。在Pt/W系统中观察到最显著的晶面化，其中在晶面消失的最高温度为1600 K。对于Pt/W和Pd/Mo系统，在[1 1 0]和[1 1 2]方向之间的无序区域形成了新的晶面。这些晶面由紧密排列的原子行组成，行之间有凹槽。在退火过程中，钨原子扩散进入Pt过层，导致合金化。
