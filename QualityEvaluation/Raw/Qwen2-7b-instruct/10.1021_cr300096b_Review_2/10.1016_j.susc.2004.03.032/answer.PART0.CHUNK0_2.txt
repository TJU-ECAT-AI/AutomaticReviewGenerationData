Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves utilizing a two-level stainless steel chamber equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments (TPD). For high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) experiments, the sample is heated to the desired temperature with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s, held for 5 seconds, and then cooled to approximately 100 K for measurements. AES is also employed to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. The deposition of Pt/Ni bimetallic surfaces is carried out at temperatures of 300 and 600 K. The electronic and physical properties of the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) interface have been extensively studied using AES and LEED techniques.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及使用两层不锈钢室，配备有Auger电子能谱（AES）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和用于温度程序脱附实验的质谱仪。对于高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）实验，样品以3 K/s的线性加热速率加热至指定温度，保持5秒，然后冷却至约100 K进行测量。还使用AES来表征Pt/Ni(1 1 1)表面。在300 K和600 K的温度下沉积了Pt/Ni双金属表面。使用AES和LEED技术对Pt/Ni(1 1 1)界面的电子和物理性质进行了广泛研究。
