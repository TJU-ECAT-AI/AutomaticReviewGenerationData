[1] "The chamber utilized for TPD and surface characterization is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr) equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments (TPD)."
[2] "The HREELS chamber is also a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 6 × 1010 Torr) equipped with AES, a mass spectrometer for TPD, and an HREELS unit."
[3] "The current study focuses on understanding the properties of the reverse deposition conditions, i.e. depositing Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."
[4] "We have chosen to study the cyclohexene hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reaction pathways on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surface, which have already been studied extensively on the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface."
[5] "By using a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), we hope to better understand the reaction pathways of cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows for the examination of the surface properties and interactions of the bimetallic structure, providing insights into its behavior under various conditions and its potential applications in catalysis.
