[1] "The chamber utilized for TPD and surface characterization is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr) equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments (TPD)."
[2] "For HREELS experiments, the Ni(1 1 1) sample (clean or Pt-modified) was heated to the specified temperature with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s, held for 5 s, then cooled to approximately 100 K to perform measurements."
[3] "AES was also used in the current study to characterize the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. Shown in Fig. 1(a) is the peak-to-peak intensity of the Pt (241 eV) and Ni (102 eV) AES features as a function of deposition time at a substrate temperature of 600 K."
[4] "The desorption of hydrogen from a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface occurs in two separate peaks, at 270 and 354 K (shown in Fig. 2 )."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves using a two-level stainless steel chamber equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments. AES is utilized to measure the peak-to-peak intensity of the Pt (241 eV) and Ni (102 eV) AES features as a function of deposition time at a substrate temperature of 600 K. The desorption of hydrogen from a clean Ni(1 1 1) surface happens in two separate peaks, at 270 and 354 K.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征包括使用两层不锈钢室，配备有Auger电子能谱（AES）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和用于温度程序脱附实验的质谱仪。在600 K的基底温度下，使用AES测量Pt（241 eV）和Ni（102 eV）AES特征的峰峰强度随沉积时间的变化。清洁Ni（1 1 1）表面的氢脱附发生在两个单独的峰值处，分别为270 K和354 K。
