<p>Two ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chambers were used in the current study. The chamber utilized for TPD and surface characterization is a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 1 × 1010 Torr) equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer for temperature-programmed desorption experiments (TPD). For the TPD experiments, the Ni(1 1 1) sample was heated with a linear heating rate of 3 K/s.</p>
<p>The experimental setup allowed us to monitor up to 12 masses simultaneously. The HREELS chamber is also a two-level stainless steel chamber (base pressure of 6 × 1010 Torr) equipped with AES, a mass spectrometer for TPD, and an HREELS unit.</p>
<p>The Ni single-crystal sample was a (1 1 1) oriented, 1.5 mm thick Ni disk (99.999%), 8 mm in diameter. The crystal was spot welded directly to two tantalum posts that served as electrical connections for resistive heating, as well as thermal contacts for cooling with liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>Cyclohexene (c-C6H10), benzene (C6H6) and cyclohexane (c-C6H12) (Aldrich, 99+% purity) were purified by successive freeze-pump-thaw cycles prior to their use.</p>
<p>The deposition of the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces was carried out with a crystal temperatures of 300 and 600 K, as noted in the figures. The TPD experiments were carried out on 600 K deposited surfaces to prevent background CO adsorption during deposition.</p>
<p>The current study would provide further understanding regarding the role of subsurface Ni in the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) system.</p>
<p>By using a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), we hope to better understand the reaction pathways of cyclohexene on the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) bimetallic surfaces.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) chambers are utilized for both temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and surface characterization, equipped with advanced tools like Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and a mass spectrometer. The chambers allow monitoring up to 12 masses simultaneously. A two-level stainless steel chamber is used for HREELS experiments, equipped with AES, a mass spectrometer for TPD, and an HREELS unit. The Ni single-crystal sample is a (1 1 1) oriented disk, spot-welded to tantalum posts for heating and cooling purposes. Pure cyclohexene, benzene, and cyclohexane are purified by freeze-pump-thaw cycles before usage. TPD experiments are conducted on 600 K deposited surfaces to avoid background CO adsorption during deposition. The study aims to provide insights into the role of subsurface Ni in the Pt/Ni(1 1 1) system by utilizing TPD and HREELS techniques to better understand the reaction pathways of cyclohexene on the bimetallic surfaces.
