[1] "The Pt crystal had two polished sides, each oriented along the (111) crystal plane and it was spot-welded between two tungsten wires (0.8 mm in diameter) wrapped with Pt foil at the spot of contact with the Pt crystal."
[2] "XPS measurements of the carbon coverage taken 20 s after the introduction of the alloy catalyst into the reaction cell showed essentially the same amount of carbon (2C = 0.5 monolayer (ML)) as that obtained after 30 min of reaction."
[3] "Special attention was given to ensure that the alloy formed on each of two sides of the crystal was as similar as possible. LEED appeared the same, and XPS revealed differences in the Pt(4f)/Sn(3d) ratio of less than 10% in all cases."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). These methods are crucial for understanding the structure of the bimetallic surfaces, allowing for accurate modeling and computational simulations. The process ensures that the surfaces are properly formed and allows researchers to compare and contrast the properties of different bimetallic alloys. This is essential for comprehending the electronic and chemical behaviors of these surfaces in the field of advanced surface science and catalysis.

In this work, we investigated PtSn surface alloys as model, unsupported catalysts for the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-butenal, CH3CH= =CHCHO). We compared the activity and selectivity of these alloys to those of similar Pt(111) model catalysts (4) and PtSn supported catalysts studied elsewhere (1). This approach allowed us to address some issues in the mechanism over supported PtSn catalysts that may result from alloy formation. Using these surface alloys instead of supported bimetallic catalysts makes it possible to exclude the influence of several factors, such as metal support interaction, incomplete reduction of the metal phase(s), size of the active metal particles, and sintering, which are known to strongly affect catalytic behavior (5).

Prior to catalytic experiments, the alloy of interest was formed on both sides of the crystal. Special attention was given to ensure that the alloy formed on each of two sides of the crystal was as similar as possible. LEED appeared the same, and XPS revealed differences in the Pt(4f)/Sn(3d) ratio of less than 10% in all cases.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces because it allows researchers to investigate the surface without the influence of metal support interactions, incomplete reduction, particle size, and sintering, which can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The similarity of the alloy formed on both sides of the crystal ensures consistency in the characterization process.

The method used to prepare the PtSn alloys involves depositing tin onto the Pt(111) surface at 300 K in ultra-high vacuum. The surface is then annealed at 1000 K for 10 seconds to ensure proper alloy formation. Both Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses are conducted to confirm the alloy formation.

Catalytic results are described by selectivity (Si), conversion (C), and turnover frequency (TOF). Selectivity is defined as the ratio of the mole fraction of the product (ni) to the sum of the mole fractions of all products (Pni). Conversion (C) is expressed as the percentage of crotonaldehyde (nc) converted to products. TOF represents the number of crotonaldehyde molecules undergoing hydrogenation per surface atom per second, calculated using the reactor volume (VR), initial pressure of crotonaldehyde (PCH), Avogadro's number (NA), mole percent of crotonaldehyde (XCH), gas constant (R), temperature (T), reaction time (t), and surface atomic density of Pt(111) (2Pt).
