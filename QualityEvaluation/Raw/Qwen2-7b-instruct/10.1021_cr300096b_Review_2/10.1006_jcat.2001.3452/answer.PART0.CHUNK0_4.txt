<quotes>
"The Pt crystal had two polished sides, each oriented along the (111) crystal plane and it was spot-welded between two tungsten wires (0.8 mm in diameter) wrapped with Pt foil at the spot of contact with the Pt crystal. The crystal could be resistively heated between 300 and 1200 K, as monitored by a chromelalumel thermocouple that was spot-welded to the side of the crystal."

The method used to prepare the PtSn alloys involves depositing tin onto the Pt(111) surface at 300 K in ultra-high vacuum. The surface is then annealed at 1000 K for 10 seconds to ensure proper alloy formation. Both Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses are conducted to confirm the alloy formation.

该研究中制备PtSn合金的方法是在300 K下将锡沉积在Pt(111)表面上，随后在1000 K下退火10秒以确保形成合金。通过低能电子衍射（LEED）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）分析来确认合金的形成。

"The selectivity Si toward a given product was determined as Si = ni
P
i ni ,[1] where ni is the mole fraction of product i in the reaction mixture. The conversion C (mol%) is defined as
C =
1 nc
. X
ni
× 100,[2] where nc is the mole fraction of crotonaldehyde in the reaction mixture, and P ni is a sum over all components in the reaction mixture. The TOF is defined as the number of crotonaldehyde molecules that undergo hydrogenation per surface atom per second according to
TOF = VR × PCH × NA × (1 XCH)
R × T × t × 2pt × Spt ,[3] where VR is the reactor volume (3.84×104 m3), PCH is the initial pressure of crotonaldehyde in the reaction mixture (Pa), NA is Avogadro’s number, XCH is the mol% of crotonaldehyde in the reaction mixture, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature of the reaction mixture (350 K), 2Pt is the surface atomic density of Pt(111) (1.505 × 1015 atoms/cm2),t is the reaction time (seconds), and S is the total surface area of the crystal (1.7 cm2)."

Catalytic results are described by selectivity (Si), conversion (C), and turnover frequency (TOF). Selectivity is defined as the ratio of the mole fraction of the product (ni) to the sum of the mole fractions of all products (Pni). Conversion (C) is expressed as the percentage of crotonaldehyde (nc) converted to products. TOF represents the number of crotonaldehyde molecules undergoing hydrogenation per surface atom per second, calculated using the reactor volume (VR), initial pressure of crotonaldehyde (PCH), Avogadro's number (NA), mole percent of crotonaldehyde (XCH), gas constant (R), temperature (T), reaction time (t), and surface atomic density of Pt(111) (2Pt).

催化结果以选择性(Si)，转化率(C)和周转频率(TOF)来描述。选择性定义为产物(mole分数为ni)与反应混合物中所有产物的总摩尔分数(Pni)之比。转化率(C)表示反应混合物中丙酮醛(nc)转化为产物的百分比。TOF表示每秒每个铂原子上发生氢化反应的丙酮醛分子数，通过反应体积(VR)，反应混合物中丙酮醛的初始压力(PCH)，阿伏伽德罗常数(NA)，丙酮醛的摩尔百分比(XCH)，气体常数(R)，反应温度(T)，反应时间(t)以及铂(111)表面的原子密度(2Pt)来计算得出。
