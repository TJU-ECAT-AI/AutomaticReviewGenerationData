How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

In this work, we investigated PtSn surface alloys as model, unsupported catalysts for the gas-phase hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (2-butenal, CH3CH= =CHCHO). We compared the activity and selectivity of these alloys to those of similar Pt(111) model catalysts (4) and PtSn supported catalysts studied elsewhere (1). This approach allowed us to address some issues in the mechanism over supported PtSn catalysts that may result from alloy formation. Using these surface alloys instead of supported bimetallic catalysts makes it possible to exclude the influence of several factors, such as metal support interaction, incomplete reduction of the metal phase(s), size of the active metal particles, and sintering, which are known to strongly affect catalytic behavior (5).

Prior to catalytic experiments, the alloy of interest was formed on both sides of the crystal. Special attention was given to ensure that the alloy formed on each of two sides of the crystal was as similar as possible. LEED appeared the same, and XPS revealed differences in the Pt(4f)/Sn(3d) ratio of less than 10% in all cases.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces because it allows researchers to investigate the surface without the influence of metal support interactions, incomplete reduction, particle size, and sintering, which can significantly affect catalytic behavior. The similarity of the alloy formed on both sides of the crystal ensures consistency in the characterization process.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许研究人员在不受到金属支持相互作用、还原不完全、颗粒大小和烧结影响的情况下研究表面。在晶体两侧形成合金的一致性确保了表征过程的一致性。
