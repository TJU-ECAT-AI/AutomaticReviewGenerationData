[1] "The Pt crystal had two polished sides, each oriented along the (111) crystal plane and it was spot-welded between two tungsten wires (0.8 mm in diameter) wrapped with Pt foil at the spot of contact with the Pt crystal."
[2] "XPS measurements of the carbon coverage taken 20 s after the introduction of the alloy catalyst into the reaction cell showed essentially the same amount of carbon (2C = 0.5 monolayer (ML)) as that obtained after 30 min of reaction."
[3] "Special attention was given to ensure that the alloy formed on each of two sides of the crystal was as similar as possible. LEED appeared the same, and XPS revealed differences in the Pt(4f)/Sn(3d) ratio of less than 10% in all cases."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). These methods are crucial for understanding the structure of the bimetallic surfaces, allowing for accurate modeling and computational simulations. The process ensures that the surfaces are properly formed and allows researchers to compare and contrast the properties of different bimetallic alloys. This is essential for comprehending the electronic and chemical behaviors of these surfaces in the field of advanced surface science and catalysis.
