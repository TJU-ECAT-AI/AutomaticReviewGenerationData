[1] "The Auger uptake curve of Ni on the Pt(110)-(1 × 1) surface shows an exponential-type growth."
[2] "On the other hand, the Auger uptake curve of Ni on the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface shows a premonolayer break with an initial linear growth."
[3] "These experimental results show that the growth of Ni on the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface changes to 3D island growth after growing one monolayer of Ni."
[4] "From the results of Auger uptake curves and the intensity profiles of LEED spots, we conclude that the growth of Ni on the Pt(110)-(1 × 1) surface follows the Volmer-Weber mode, while the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface follows the Stranski-Krastanov mode."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The Auger uptake curve analysis reveals the growth mode on the surface. For the Pt(110)-(1 × 1) surface, the exponential-type growth indicates a Volmer-Weber mode, suggesting a monolayer-by-monolayer growth. Conversely, the premonolayer break with an initial linear growth on the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface points to a Stranski-Krastanov mode, implying layer growth followed by 3D island formation. These findings contribute to a deeper insight into the growth mechanisms and properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The growth mechanisms on the surfaces are determined through Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The AES uptake curves and LEED spot intensity profiles reveal that the growth of Ni on the Pt(110)-(1 × 1) surface follows the Volmer-Weber (VW) mode, whereas the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface exhibits the Stranski-Krastanov (SK) mode of growth.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Specifically, the use of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) allows us to observe the growth mechanisms of Ni on both reconstructed (1 × 2) and unreconstructed (1 × 1) surfaces of the Pt(110) substrate at low temperatures. The results indicate that the growth of Ni on the Pt(110)-(1 × 1) surface follows the Volmer-Weber (VW) mode, while the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface exhibits layer growth followed by aggregation into 3D islands, indicative of the Stranski-Krastanov (SK) mode.

[3] "The corresponding coverage of Ni is 1/2 monolayer (ML) at this time."

This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The Auger uptake curve reveals the growth mode of Ni on the Pt(110) surface. On the (1 × 1) surface, the curve varies almost exponentially, suggesting 3D island growth. On the (1 × 2) surface, the curve initially presents a linear variation with a break at 250 seconds, indicating the complete filling of the missing-row sites with Ni atoms. This change signifies the growth mode shifts to 3D island growth after forming one monolayer of Ni.
