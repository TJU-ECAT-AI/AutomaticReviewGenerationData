[1] "The Auger uptake curve for deposition on the (1 X 2) surface presents a different fashion: we found that the Auger intensity of Ni increases linearly with a break at 250 s as shown in Fig. 3b."
[2] "The change of the slope on the Auger uptake curve is interpreted as a complete layer on a flat surface."
[3] "The corresponding coverage of Ni is 1/2 monolayer (ML) at this time."
[4] "These experimental results show that the growth of Ni on the Pt(110)-(1 × 2) surface changes to 3D island growth after growing one monolayer of Ni."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The Auger uptake curve reveals the growth mode of Ni on the Pt(110) surface. On the (1 × 1) surface, the curve varies almost exponentially, suggesting 3D island growth. On the (1 × 2) surface, the curve initially presents a linear variation with a break at 250 seconds, indicating the complete filling of the missing-row sites with Ni atoms. This change signifies the growth mode shifts to 3D island growth after forming one monolayer of Ni.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，尤其是在高级表面科学和催化研究领域。Auger吸收曲线揭示了Ni在Pt(110)表面的生长模式。在（1 × 1）表面上，曲线几乎呈指数变化，这表明存在三维岛屿生长。在（1 × 2）表面上，曲线最初呈现线性变化，在250秒时出现断裂，表明填充缺失行位点的Ni原子完成。这一变化表明，形成一层Ni后，生长模式转变为三维岛屿生长。
