[1] "Experiments were conducted in a stainless-steel ultrahigh vacuum chamber. The UHV pumping system kept the working background pressure better than 3 × 10- l0 Torr."
[2] "The Ni deposition source was a sharp point bent from 1 mm diameter wire. Liquid nitrogen was used to cool the sample continuously and control the temperature at 130 K in the deposition process."
[3] "We found that Ni atoms deposited on the (1 × 1) surface have a 3D island growth, suggesting the Volmer-Weber (VW) growth mode, whereas Ni atoms deposited on the (1 × 2) surface undergo layer growth followed by aggregation into 3D islands, indicating the Stranski-Krastanov (SK) growth mode."

1. Experiments were performed in a stainless-steel ultrahigh vacuum chamber with a working background pressure below 3 × 10^-10 Torr.
2. The nickel deposition source was a bent 1 mm diameter wire tip. Liquid nitrogen was utilized to maintain the sample at 130 K throughout the deposition process.
3. The growth of nickel on the (1 × 1) surface showed characteristics consistent with the Volmer-Weber (VW) growth mode, while the growth on the (1 × 2) surface exhibited the Stranski-Krastanov (SK) growth mode, characterized by layer growth followed by the formation of 3D islands.

1. 实验在不锈钢超高真空室中进行，工作背景压力低于3 × 10^-10托。
2. 镍沉积源是一根弯曲的直径为1毫米的线材尖端。使用液氮连续冷却样品，并控制其在沉积过程中的温度为130 K。
3. 镍在（1 × 1）表面的生长表现出与Volmer-Weber（VW）生长模式一致的特点，而在（1 × 2）表面上的生长则表现为层状生长后聚集形成三维岛屿，这表明了Stranski-Krastanov（SK）生长模式。
