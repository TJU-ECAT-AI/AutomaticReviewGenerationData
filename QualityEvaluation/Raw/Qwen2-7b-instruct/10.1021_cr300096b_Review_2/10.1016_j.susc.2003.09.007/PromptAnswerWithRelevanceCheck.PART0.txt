The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Techniques such as AES, LEED, LEIS, XPS, and STM are utilized to determine the surface composition and structure. These techniques provide insights into the electronic states of the surface atoms, which are influenced by the presence of subsurface Ni atoms. The weakening of metal-adsorbate bonds is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms by the subsurface Ni atoms.

<p>Experiments were performed in three different UHV chambers. Temperature programmed desorption experiments were performed in a UHV chamber equipped with AES, LEED optics and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. This chamber was described in detail elsewhere [11] . The UHV chamber for the LEIS and XPS experiments was also described elsewhere [12] . The STM experiments were performed in a UHV chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 1010 Torr. The chamber was equipped with AES and an Omicron VT scanning tunneling microscope and was described in detail elsewhere [13] . The Pt(1 1 1) crystal (5 N purity) was purchased from Princeton Scientific Corp.; it was oriented to within 0.4 of the (1 1 1) surface and was polished to a roughness of less than 0.03 μm. The crystal size was 10 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm.</p>
<p>Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%). In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly. The Ni source in the LEIS chamber was also water-cooled. In the other chambers, a stainless steel shield surrounded the assembly. After sufficient outgassing of the source, the chamber background pressure remained below 7 × 1010 Torr during nickel evaporation. The Ni source was operated at constant current and the amount of Ni deposited on the crystal was controlled by exposure time. Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>The amount of Ni deposition was primarily characterized by the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) AES ratio. Our earlier designation of the 1 ML Ni/Pt surface was based on the assumption of layer-by-layer growth for Ni and determination of the coverage where the Pt AES intensity was attenuated to 66% of its initial value [14] . This coincidentally occurred at a Ni/Pt AES ratio of 1.0. This will be the characteristic AES ratio of a surface which we refer to as a 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface. The accuracy of this designation is discussed in more detail in a later section. The surfaces prepared are further categorized in terms of the thermal history of the sample during deposition. Thus, a surface prepared by deposition on a sample at room temperature with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity will be referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K; one prepared by deposition at 600 K to the same AES ratio is designated 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K. Surfaces prepared by deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing to near 600 K for an amount of time, equivalent to the deposition time with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity after annealing, are referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates involves utilizing a series of surface science techniques including AES, LEED, LEIS, XPS, and STM. The AES technique, particularly when combined with the LEED technique, provides insight into the surface composition. The LEIS technique allows for high-resolution analysis of the surface, providing information on the chemical state of the atoms. XPS offers elemental analysis and chemical state identification. STM is used for imaging the surface structure, allowing for the observation of the surface morphology and the arrangement of atoms. AES and XPS are further utilized to monitor the surface composition during the deposition process at different temperatures. The thermal history of the sample during deposition influences the categorization of the surfaces, leading to designations like 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K, 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 600 K, and 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K. This comprehensive approach enables a deep understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, crucial for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted through a series of experimental techniques in different ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers. Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition on a Pt(1 1 1) crystal purchased from Princeton Scientific Corp. The deposition process and the thermal history were used to categorize the surfaces. Surface spectroscopic techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) were combined to assess the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The AES ratio of Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) was primarily used to characterize the Ni deposition. The kinetic parameters for desorption were determined by analyzing the peak desorption temperatures observed in a temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiment. STM was employed to study the growth of Ni films on Pt(1 1 1) under various deposition conditions. The kinetic parameters for desorption were analyzed through a Redhead analysis, which was compatible with the results from the work of Gambardella et al. who studied Ni deposition on a vicinal Pt(9 9 7) surface. Additionally, Ni films were also synthesized by direct deposition at 640 K for comparative purposes. The calculated heats of dissociative adsorption (HBEs) were plotted against the d-band center for each surface, considering the relaxed and unrelaxed slabs. Hydrogen atoms were only considered at 0.25 ML coverages in the fcc binding site of the surface during the calculations.
