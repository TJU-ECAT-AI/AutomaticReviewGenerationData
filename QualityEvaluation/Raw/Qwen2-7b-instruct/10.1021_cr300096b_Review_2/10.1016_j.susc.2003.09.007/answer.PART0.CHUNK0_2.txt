[1] "Experiments were performed in three different UHV chambers."
[2] "The chamber for the LEIS and XPS experiments was also described elsewhere [12]."
[3] "The STM experiments were performed in a UHV chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 1010 Torr."
[4] "The Pt(1 1 1) crystal (5 N purity) was purchased from Princeton Scientific Corp.; it was oriented to within 0.4 of the (1 1 1) surface and was polished to a roughness of less than 0.03 μm."
[5] "Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition."
[6] "Combinations of AES, XPS, LEIS and STM in the different chambers were used to characterize the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface."
[7] "The amount of Ni deposition was primarily characterized by the Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) AES ratio."
[8] "Our earlier designation of the 1 ML Ni/Pt surface was based on the assumption of layer-by-layer growth for Ni and determination of the coverage where the Pt AES intensity was attenuated to 66% of its initial value."
[9] "The surfaces prepared are further categorized in terms of the thermal history of the sample during deposition."
[10] "The kinetic parameters for desorption are typically determined by a Redhead analysis of the peak desorption temperatures observed in a TPD experiment as a function of coverage at a constant heating rate [17]."
[11] "STM was used to study the growth of Ni films on Pt(1 1 1) under different deposition conditions."
[12] "The work of Gambardella et al. was done at lower coverages of Ni (0.2 ML) on a Pt(9 9 7) surface, which is vicinal to the (1 1 1) surface and may be more susceptible to alloy formation at lower temperatures due to higher step concentrations."
[13] "For comparison, Ni films were also deposited at 640 K."
[14] "The calculated HBEs are summarized in Fig. 9b , where they are plotted against the d-band center (relative to the Fermi level) for each particular surface, for relaxed and unrelaxed slabs."
[15] "In the calculations that follow, H atoms were only considered at 0.25 ML coverages, and only in the fcc binding site of the surface."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted through a series of experimental techniques in different ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chambers. Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition on a Pt(1 1 1) crystal purchased from Princeton Scientific Corp. The deposition process and the thermal history were used to categorize the surfaces. Surface spectroscopic techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) were combined to assess the amount of Ni deposited on the Pt(1 1 1) surface. The AES ratio of Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) was primarily used to characterize the Ni deposition. The kinetic parameters for desorption were determined by analyzing the peak desorption temperatures observed in a temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiment. STM was employed to study the growth of Ni films on Pt(1 1 1) under various deposition conditions. The kinetic parameters for desorption were analyzed through a Redhead analysis, which was compatible with the results from the work of Gambardella et al. who studied Ni deposition on a vicinal Pt(9 9 7) surface. Additionally, Ni films were also synthesized by direct deposition at 640 K for comparative purposes. The calculated heats of dissociative adsorption (HBEs) were plotted against the d-band center for each surface, considering the relaxed and unrelaxed slabs. Hydrogen atoms were only considered at 0.25 ML coverages in the fcc binding site of the surface during the calculations.

在不同的超高真空（UHV）室中，对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行了系列实验技术的表征。通过物理蒸发沉积的方法，在普林斯顿科学公司购买的Pt(1 1 1)晶体上沉积镍。通过沉积过程和热历史来分类这些表面。使用表面光谱技术如Auger电子能谱（AES）、低能量离子散射光谱（LEIS）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）结合评估了Ni在Pt(1 1 1)表面的沉积量。Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) AES比率主要被用于表征Ni的沉积情况。通过分析温度程序脱附（TPD）实验中观察到的峰脱附温度确定了脱附动力学参数。使用Redhead分析方法研究了脱附峰值温度与覆盖度之间的关系，这与Gambardella等人关于在接近（1 1 1）表面的Pt(9 9 7)表面上Ni沉积的工作结果一致。此外，还通过直接在640 K下沉积Ni薄膜进行比较。计算了吸附态解离能（HBEs），将其与每个表面的d带中心（相对于费米能级）绘制在一起，考虑了松弛和未松弛的片层。仅在表面的fcc结合位点考虑了氢原子在0.25 ML覆盖率的情况。
