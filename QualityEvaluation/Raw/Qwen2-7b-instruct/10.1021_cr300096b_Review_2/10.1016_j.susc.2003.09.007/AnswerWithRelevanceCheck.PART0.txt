          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Techniques such as AES, LEED, LEIS, XPS, and STM are utilized to determine the surface composition and structure. These techniques provide insights into the electronic states of the surface atoms, which are influenced by the presence of subsurface Ni atoms. The weakening of metal-adsorbate bonds is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms by the subsurface Ni atoms.

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves a series of experimental techniques. These include temperature programmed desorption (TPD) for assessing chemical reactivity, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) for examining surface morphology, low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS) for surface composition analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) for determining elemental composition and electronic structure, and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) for studying surface elements. The AES ratio of Ni(LMM)/Pt(237 eV) is primarily used to characterize the amount of Ni deposition on the Pt surface.
