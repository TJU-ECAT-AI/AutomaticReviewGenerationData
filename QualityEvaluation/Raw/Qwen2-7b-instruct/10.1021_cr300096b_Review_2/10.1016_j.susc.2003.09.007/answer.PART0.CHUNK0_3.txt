<p>Experiments were performed in three different UHV chambers. Temperature programmed desorption experiments were performed in a UHV chamber equipped with AES, LEED optics and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. This chamber was described in detail elsewhere [11] . The UHV chamber for the LEIS and XPS experiments was also described elsewhere [12] .</p>
<p>The STM experiments were performed in a UHV chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 10<sup>-10</sup> Torr. The chamber was equipped with AES and an Omicron VT scanning tunneling microscope and was described in detail elsewhere [13] .</p>
<p>Nickel was deposited by physical vapor deposition. The source consisted of Ni wires (Alfa Aesar, 99.95%) wrapped around a resistively heated tungsten wire (Goodfellow, 99.95%). In the STM chamber, a water-cooled stainless steel jacket with an adjustable shutter surrounded the whole assembly.</p>
<p>Surfaces prepared by deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing to near 600 K for an amount of time, equivalent to the deposition time with a Ni/Pt AES ratio near unity after annealing, are referred to as 1 ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) 300 K/600 K.</p>
<p>Subsurface Ni atoms could lead to a weaker metalhydrogen bond by modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves a series of experimental techniques. The process includes temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These methods are crucial for understanding the structural, compositional, and chemical properties of the surfaces. Physical vapor deposition is used to deposit nickel on the Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The surfaces are categorized based on their thermal history during deposition and annealing, particularly concerning the Ni/Pt AES ratio. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that subsurface Ni atoms modify the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms, weakening the metalhydrogen bond.

The characterization process is essential for comprehending the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The combination of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations provides insights into the structure, composition, and bonding characteristics of the surfaces, enabling a deeper understanding of their catalytic behavior.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及一系列实验技术。这一过程包括温度程序脱附（TPD）实验、扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、低能离子散射光谱（LEIS）、X射线光电子光谱（XPS）和俄歇电子光谱（AES）。这些方法对于理解表面的结构、组成和化学性质至关重要。通过物理蒸镀在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积镍。表面根据其沉积和退火过程中的热历史分类，特别是基于退火后Ni/Pt AES比。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，表面Pt原子的电子结构被表面下Ni原子修改，导致金属氢键变弱。

表征过程对于理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下。实验技术和理论计算的结合提供了有关表面结构、组成和键合特性的见解，从而加深了我们对它们催化行为的理解。
