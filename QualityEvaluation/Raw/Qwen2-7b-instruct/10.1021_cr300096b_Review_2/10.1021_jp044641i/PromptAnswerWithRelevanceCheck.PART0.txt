<p>The presence of Ru on the Pt(100) surface elicits, in addition to the peak found for pristine Pt(100), a CO stretching feature at a slightly lower energy. This peak can be clearly seen for freshly prepared Ru/Pt [θRu(0 h) = 0.52] and with decreased intensity for Ru/Pt [θRu(0 h) = 0.24].</p>
<p>As the bimetallic surfaces are thermally annealed, the intensity of this new feature decreases, whereas that attributed to Pt(100) sites increases. This phenomenon is consistent with the dissolution of Ru into the Pt surface layers.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of the data collected revealed that the total integrated area under the two CO spectral features remains fairly constant for all surfaces and CO exposures examined and equal in value to the corresponding areas found for bare Pt(100).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chambers equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. By taking advantage of the solubility of Ru into the Pt lattice, surfaces are prepared where the amount of Ru is gradually depleted by controlled heating. This allows for a comparison of the coverage of Ru on the surface, which is typically smaller than the measured amount due to the method of preparation. The analysis of the CO stretching region in the infrared reflection absorption spectra (IRAS) provides insights into the properties of CO adsorbed on both pristine Pt(100) sites and sites induced by the presence of Ru, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surfaces.

[2] "The agreement between our tr-IRAS data after exposure correction (·) and that of Bradshaw et al.22 for Pt(100) at 90 K was found to be very good."
[3] "The fact that the data points for the Pt(100) sites on the Ru/Pt surface () do not fall on top of the bare Pt(100) line should not be surprising, as the coverage at a constant exposure is not the same and, more specifically, is smaller for the Ru-modified compared to the bare Pt surface."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to study how the presence of Ni affects the Pt surface's properties, such as its reactivity and stability. The use of infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) helps quantify these interactions by examining the changes in the infrared absorption spectra of the surfaces before and after Ni deposition. The close agreement between the IRAS data of Ru/Pt surfaces and those of Pt(100) surfaces at various CO exposures suggests that the modification of the Pt surface by Ru does not significantly alter the overall surface coverage, providing insights into the exchange of Ru by Pt sites during the thermal treatment. The discrepancy in the data points for Pt(100) sites on the Ru/Pt surface compared to the bare Pt(100) line highlights the differences in coverage and properties due to the presence of Ni, which is essential for understanding the complex interactions between the two metals.
