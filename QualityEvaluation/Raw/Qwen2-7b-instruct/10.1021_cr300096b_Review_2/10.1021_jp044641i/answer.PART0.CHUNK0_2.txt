[1] "Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) measurements were performed by use of an FTIR spectrometer (Mattson Cygnus 25) coupled to the UHV chamber and a HgCdTe detector (MCT, EG&G Judson)."
[2] "The choice of Lorentzians as the fitting functions introduces some uncertainties in the actual ratios of the two features."
[3] "The presence of Ru on the Pt(100) surface elicits, in addition to the peak found for pristine Pt(100), a CO stretching feature at a slightly lower energy."
[4] "As the bimetallic surfaces are thermally annealed, the intensity of this new feature decreases, whereas that attributed to Pt(100) sites increases."
[5] "Statistical analysis of the data collected revealed that the total integrated area under the two CO spectral features remains fairly constant for all surfaces and CO exposures examined and equal in value to the corresponding areas found for bare Pt(100)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the bimetallic interface. The precise control over the interface provides insights into how the properties of the individual metals are influenced by their interaction, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity in various chemical reactions.
