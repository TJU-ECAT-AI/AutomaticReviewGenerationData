[1] "The presence of Ru on the Pt(100) surface elicits, in addition to the peak found for pristine Pt(100), a CO stretching feature at a slightly lower energy."
[2] "As the bimetallic surfaces are thermally annealed, the intensity of this new feature decreases, whereas that attributed to Pt(100) sites increases."
[3] "Statistical analysis of the data collected revealed that the total integrated area under the two CO spectral features remains fairly constant for all surfaces and CO exposures examined and equal in value to the corresponding areas found for bare Pt(100)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves analyzing their electronic and chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. By examining the interactions and compositions of the bimetallic surfaces, researchers can predict and optimize their performance in various applications, such as catalytic reactions.
