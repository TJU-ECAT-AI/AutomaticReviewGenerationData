[1] "Infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) measurements were performed by use of an FTIR spectrometer (Mattson Cygnus 25) coupled to the UHV chamber and a HgCdTe detector (MCT, EG&G Judson)."
[2] "The agreement between our tr-IRAS data after exposure correction (·) and that of Bradshaw et al.22 for Pt(100) at 90 K was found to be very good."
[3] "The fact that the data points for the Pt(100) sites on the Ru/Pt surface () do not fall on top of the bare Pt(100) line should not be surprising, as the coverage at a constant exposure is not the same and, more specifically, is smaller for the Ru-modified compared to the bare Pt surface."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to study how the presence of Ni affects the Pt surface's properties, such as its reactivity and stability. The use of infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) helps quantify these interactions by examining the changes in the infrared absorption spectra of the surfaces before and after Ni deposition. The close agreement between the IRAS data of Ru/Pt surfaces and those of Pt(100) surfaces at various CO exposures suggests that the modification of the Pt surface by Ru does not significantly alter the overall surface coverage, providing insights into the exchange of Ru by Pt sites during the thermal treatment. The discrepancy in the data points for Pt(100) sites on the Ru/Pt surface compared to the bare Pt(100) line highlights the differences in coverage and properties due to the presence of Ni, which is essential for understanding the complex interactions between the two metals.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单分子层。这一过程对于先进表面科学和催化研究中的结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许研究人员研究Ni的存在如何影响Pt表面的性质，如其活性和稳定性。红外反射吸收光谱（IRAS）的使用通过检查表面在Ni沉积前后红外吸收光谱的变化来量化这些相互作用。Ru/Pt表面的IRAS数据与Pt(100)表面的数据之间良好的一致性表明，Ru对Pt表面的修改并未显著改变总体表面覆盖度，提供了热处理过程中Ru由Pt位点交换的信息。数据点之间的差异反映了Pt(100)位点在Ru/Pt表面与纯Pt(100)线之间的不一致性，这强调了Ni的存在对覆盖度和性质的影响，这对于理解两种金属之间复杂相互作用至关重要。
