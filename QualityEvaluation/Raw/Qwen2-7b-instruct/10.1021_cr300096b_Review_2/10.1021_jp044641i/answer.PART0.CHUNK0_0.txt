<p>The presence of Ru on the Pt(100) surface elicits, in addition to the peak found for pristine Pt(100), a CO stretching feature at a slightly lower energy. This peak can be clearly seen for freshly prepared Ru/Pt [θRu(0 h) = 0.52] and with decreased intensity for Ru/Pt [θRu(0 h) = 0.24].</p>
<p>As the bimetallic surfaces are thermally annealed, the intensity of this new feature decreases, whereas that attributed to Pt(100) sites increases. This phenomenon is consistent with the dissolution of Ru into the Pt surface layers.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis of the data collected revealed that the total integrated area under the two CO spectral features remains fairly constant for all surfaces and CO exposures examined and equal in value to the corresponding areas found for bare Pt(100).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The deposition creates a unique interface that influences catalytic activity and reactivity. The surfaces are often studied using techniques like XPS, AES, LEED, and IRAS to analyze the composition, structure, and adsorbate interactions. The thermodynamic stability, reactivity patterns, and electronic properties of these surfaces can significantly impact applications in catalysis, energy conversion, and other advanced surface science areas.
