[1] "All experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "Advantage was taken of the solubility of Ru into the Pt lattice to prepare surfaces in which the amount of Ru was gradually depleted by controlled heating."
[3] "The fact that the data points for the Pt(100) sites on the Ru/Pt surface () do not fall on top of the bare Pt(100) line should not be surprising, as the coverage at a constant exposure is not the same and, more specifically, is smaller for the Ru-modified compared to the bare Pt surface."
[4] "The conclusions emerging from the analysis of the CO stretching region in the IRAS spectra of Pt(100) and Ru-modified Pt surfaces presented in this study may be summarized as follows:"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chambers equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. By taking advantage of the solubility of Ru into the Pt lattice, surfaces are prepared where the amount of Ru is gradually depleted by controlled heating. This allows for a comparison of the coverage of Ru on the surface, which is typically smaller than the measured amount due to the method of preparation. The analysis of the CO stretching region in the infrared reflection absorption spectra (IRAS) provides insights into the properties of CO adsorbed on both pristine Pt(100) sites and sites induced by the presence of Ru, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surfaces.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征使用了配备有Auger电子能谱(AES)、X射线光电子能谱(XPS)和低能电子衍射(LEED)的超高真空(UHV)室。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。通过利用Ru在Pt晶格中的溶解性，制备了在受控加热下逐渐减少Ru含量的表面。这使得能够比较Ru在表面上的覆盖率，通常比测量值小，这是由于准备方法的原因。对CO伸缩区域在红外反射吸收光谱(IRAS)中的分析提供了关于Pt(100)原位上吸附的CO和由Ru的存在诱导出的Pt位点的性质的见解，为全面理解双金属表面做出了贡献。
