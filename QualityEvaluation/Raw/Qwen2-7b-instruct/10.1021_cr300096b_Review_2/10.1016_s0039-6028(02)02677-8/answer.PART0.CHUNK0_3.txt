<p>The BFS method for alloys was applied to the analysis of the early stages of Pt growth on a Cu substrate. The results are compared, for each coverage, with a similar analysis of the Pd/Cu(1 0 0) surface alloy formation process showing that, in spite of the similarities at very low coverage, some basic differences account for the different growth patterns observed at higher coverages.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
