<p>The BFS method [16] is based on the concept that the energy of formation of a given atomic configuration is the superposition of the individual atomic contributions ΔH=Σεi. Each contribution by atom i, εi, is the sum of two terms: a strain energy, εSi, computed in the actual lattice as if every neighbor of the atom i was of the same atomic species i, and a chemical energy, εCi, computed as if every neighbor of the atom i was in an equilibrium lattice site of a crystal of species i, but retaining its actual chemical identity.</p>
<p>Table 1 lists the necessary parameters for applying the BFS method to the CuPd and CuPt systems. We refer the reader to Refs. [16] , [18] for a detailed discussion of the BFS method, its definitions, operational equations and their implementation.</p>

The BFS method for alloys, as applied to the study of Pt deposition on Cu(1 0 0), is based on the concept that the energy of formation of a given atomic configuration is the sum of individual atomic contributions. These contributions include a strain energy and a chemical energy. The strain energy is calculated as if every neighbor of an atom was of the same atomic species, while the chemical energy considers the equilibrium lattice site of a crystal of the same species but retains the actual chemical identity of the atom. The method was previously applied to the CuPd system, successfully reproducing its observed behavior.

对于合金的BFS方法，在研究Pt在Cu(1 0 0)上的沉积时，基于这样一个概念：特定原子配置的能量是各个原子贡献的叠加。这些贡献包括应变能和化学能。应变能是在假定每个相邻原子都是同种原子物种的情况下计算的，而化学能则考虑的是相同物种的晶体中平衡晶格位置，但保留实际的化学身份。该方法之前已应用于CuPd系统，成功地重现了其观察到的行为。

Figure 2 illustrates atomic configurations for a deposited Pd or Pt atom on a Cu(1 0 0) surface. These configurations encompass the adatom in the overlayer (X(O)), in the surface layer with the ejected Cu atom in a nearest-neighbor (NN) site in the overlayer (X(S)Cu(O)1), or away from the inserted atom (X(S)Cu(O)f).

When analyzing two adatoms, significant differences emerge between the growth patterns of Pd/Cu(1 0 0) and Pt/Cu(1 0 0). At this very low coverage, a c(2×2) pattern is evident for Pd/Cu(1 0 0), while a p(2×2) pattern is observed for Pt/Cu(1 0 0).

在分析两个adatom时，Pd/Cu(1 0 0)和Pt/Cu(1 0 0)的生长模式之间出现了显著差异。在这一非常低的覆盖率下，Pd/Cu(1 0 0)展现出c(2×2)模式，而Pt/Cu(1 0 0)则表现出p(2×2)模式。
