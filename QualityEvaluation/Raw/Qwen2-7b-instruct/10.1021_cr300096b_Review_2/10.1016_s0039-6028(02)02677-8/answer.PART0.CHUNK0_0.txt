Growth of Pt/Cu( ): an atomistic modeling comparison with the Pd/Cu( ) surface alloy Abstract The BFS method for alloys is applied to the study of Pt deposition on Cu(1 0 0). The formation of a CuPt surface alloy is discussed within the framework of previous results for Pd/Cu(1 0 0). In spite of the fact that both Pd and Pt share the same basic behavior when deposited on Cu, it is seen that subtle differences become responsible for the differences in growth observed at higher coverages. In agreement with experiment, all the main features of Pt/Cu(1 0 0) and Pd/Cu(1 0 0) are obtained by means of a simple modeling scheme, and explained in terms of a few basic ingredients that emerge from the BFS analysis.

Answer: 
The BFS method for alloys is applied to analyze the early stages of Pt growth on a Cu substrate, comparing the results with a similar process for Pd on Cu(1 0 0). Despite the shared basic behavior of Pd and Pt when deposited on Cu, subtle differences in their growth patterns are observed at higher coverages. The main features of Pt/Cu(1 0 0) and Pd/Cu(1 0 0) are obtained and explained through a simple modeling scheme derived from the BFS analysis.

应用BFS合金方法来分析铂在铜基底上的早期生长阶段，并将其结果与在Cu（1 0 0）上钯的类似过程进行比较。尽管钯和铂在沉积到铜表面时具有相同的基本行为，但在较高覆盖度下观察到了它们生长模式之间的细微差别。通过简单的建模方案，结合从BFS分析中得出的基本成分，获得了Pt/Cu(1 0 0)和Pd/Cu(1 0 0)的主要特征，并对此进行了解释。
