<p>It is interesting to compare Pt/Cu(1 0 0) surface alloys to the Pd/Cu(1 0 0) case, as both evolve into a c(2×2) structure but with marked differences during the growth process.</p>
<p>A strong tendency towards surface alloy formation is expected for the Pt/Cu(1 0 0) system since the bulk mixing enthalpy is exothermic. The same is true for the CuPd system, but the fact that Pt has a significantly higher surface energy than Pd suggests that differences in the geometry of the surface alloy could be expected.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Pt/Cu(1 0 0) system is not as well characterized. Pt adsorption leads to a somewhat random pattern of Pt substitutions in the Cu substrate at low coverages. However, the formation of a well ordered surface requires Pt coverages slightly in excess of 0.5 ML and thermal activation to 530 K, while annealing above this temperature leads to slow dissolution of Pt in the bulk.</p>
<p>The BFS method for alloys has been applied to the CuPd system, successfully reproducing the observed behavior in Pd/Cu(1 0 0), Pd/Cu(1 1 0) and Cu/Pd(1 0 0). In this work, we present results of a modeling effort at the atomic level, also based on the BFS method for alloys, meant to elucidate the main characteristics of the early growth stages of Pt on Cu(1 0 0), comparing the results with a similar process for Pd on Cu(1 0 0).</p>
<p>At low coverage, the seed of a c(2×2) pattern is observed for Pd/Cu(1 0 0) and a p(2×2) for Pt/Cu(1 0 0). However, as the coverage increases, the competition between the attraction of Pt(S) and Cu(O) atoms and the repulsion between Pt(S) atoms, is the driving force for the emergence of the observed ordering pattern. As expected, those configurations that maximize the distance between Pt(S) atoms are greatly favored.</p>
<p>Similar configurational analyses for N>4 indicate that the lowest energy state is a p(2×2) patch with additional Pt(S) located at distances smaller than those necessary for the continuation of a p(2×2) pattern. Not surprisingly, those bare Pt(S) atoms locate themselves in surface sites that follow, instead, a c(2×2) pattern.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that Pt interdiffusion in Cu is expected, like in the Pd/Cu(1 0 0) case. In spite of the higher strain induced by larger Pt atoms inside the Cu substrate, the alloying effect of the strong PtCu bonds results in Pt interdiffusion, which would lead to the formation of a mixed phase in the near-surface layers.</p>

This literature discusses the growth of Pt and Pd alloys on Cu surfaces, comparing the two processes. The Pt/Cu(1 0 0) system tends to form a c(2×2) structure, while the Pd/Cu(1 0 0) system evolves into a p(2×2) structure at low coverage. As the coverage increases, the Pt/S and Cu/O interactions lead to a preference for a p(2×2) structure, whereas the Pd/S and Cu/O interactions favor a c(2×2) structure. The literature also notes that both systems exhibit interdiffusion in Cu, with Pt atoms penetrating the Cu substrate despite the increased strain, due to the strong Pt-Cu bonds.

本文献讨论了在Cu表面生长Pt和Pd合金的过程，并将两种过程进行比较。Pt/Cu(1 0 0)系统的结构倾向于形成c(2×2)结构，而Pd/Cu(1 0 0)系统在低覆盖度下形成p(2×2)结构。随着覆盖度的增加，Pt/S和Cu/O之间的相互作用导致了对p(2×2)结构的偏好，而Pd/S和Cu/O之间的相互作用则有利于c(2×2)结构。文献还指出，两个系统均表现出在Cu中的互扩散现象，尽管Pt原子在Cu基体内的应变增加，但由于强烈的Pt-Cu键，Pt原子仍会渗透到Cu基体中形成混合相。
