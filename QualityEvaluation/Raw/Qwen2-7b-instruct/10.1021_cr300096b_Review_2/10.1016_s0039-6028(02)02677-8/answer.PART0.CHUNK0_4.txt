<p>The BFS method for alloys [16], a quantum approximate method for atomistic modeling, has been applied to the CuPd system, successfully reproducing the observed behavior in Pd/Cu(1 0 0), Pd/Cu(1 1 0) and Cu/Pd(1 0 0) [17]. In this work, we present results of a modeling effort at the atomic level, also based on the BFS method for alloys, meant to elucidate the main characteristics of the early growth stages of Pt on Cu(1 0 0), comparing the results with a similar process for Pd on Cu(1 0 0).</p>
<p>In what follows, an atom X (X=Pd, Pt, Cu) occupying a site in layer Y (Y=overlayer (O), surface (S), first (1b) and second (2b) plane below the surface), will be denoted with X(Y). A pair of atoms can be then denoted with X1(Y1)X2(Y2)d, where d denotes the distance between atoms X1 and X2. The distance d can be 1, 2 or f, depending on whether X1 and X2 are NN, next-nearest-neighbors (NNN) or farther apart, respectively.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows atomic configurations corresponding to one deposited Pd or Pt atom. These include the adatom in the overlayer (X(O)), in the surface layer with the ejected Cu atom in a NN site in the overlayer (X(S)Cu(O)1) or away from the inserted atom (X(S)Cu(O)f). Two states showing the X atom in the first and second layer below the surface are also shown X(1b)Cu(O) and X(2b)Cu(O), respectively. The energy level spectra for these states are nearly identical, showing preference for substitution of surface Cu atoms. The lowest energy state corresponds to the structure X(S)Cu(O)1. It is immediately followed by X(S)Cu(O)f, and by states showing interdiffusion of X to the first (1b) and second (2b) plane below the surface (S), as shown in Fig. 3.</p>
<p>However, a similar analysis for two adatoms allows us to identify substantial differences between the growth patterns of Pd/ and Pt/Cu(1 0 0). It is already at this very low coverage that the seed of a c(2×2) pattern is observed for Pd/Cu(1 0 0) and a p(2×2) for Pt/Cu(1 0 0). To fully understand the observed behavior, it is important to scan the whole spectrum, besides just focusing on the lowest energy state.</p>

The levels are located according to their energy relative to the difference in energy between the lowest (X(S)Cu(O)1) and highest (X(O)) energy states (0.6393 eV/atom for Pd and 1.3451 eV/atom for Pt).</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows some of the most important configurations, and Fig. 5 shows the corresponding energy level spectra. The highest energy state, in both cases, corresponds to a dimer in the overlayer, X(O)X(O)2 (X=Pd, Pt), indicating that the formation of a surface alloy is favored over epitaxial growth. The ground state band for Pt/Cu(1 0 0) (i.e., the cluster of energy levels at the bottom of the spectrum) indicates a clear preference for a p(2×2) arrangement, followed by a number of states characterized by the varying proximity between the substituted Pt(S) atoms. It is interesting to note that the state closest to the lowest energy state allows the insertion of NN Pt(S) dimers, with a peculiar location for the displaced Cu(O) atoms. Due to the high energy of a similar arrangement where the Cu(1 0 0) atoms fully link the Pt(S) atoms ( Fig. 4(c) ), it is clear that the location of the Cu(O) atoms is responsible for the low energy of the state shown in Fig. 4(h) . After a small energy gap, a state displaying c(2×2) ordering appears ( Fig. 4(g) ). In contrast with this energy level distribution, the Pd/Cu(1 0 0) spectrum displays a reversal between the p(2×2) and c(2×2) states, favoring the formation of a c(2×2) structure, with a much smaller energy gap between these two types of patterns with respect to the Pt/Cu(1 0 0) case. This can be explained by the fact that, at this level of coverage, a p(2×2) structure can be thought of as an incomplete c(2×2) structure, as it only takes one additional substitution to complete a c(2×2) pattern from a p(2×2) one. In other words, a p(2×2) structure sets a lower bound for proximity between the substituted atoms: if the p(2×2) structure is the lowest one in energy (as is the case for Pt), it takes a large energy cost to build a c(2×2) structure, as it implies locating atoms at closer distances than what a p(2×2) allows. Conversely, a smaller energy cost is necessary to build a p(2×2) from a c(2×2) structure (as is the case for Pd).</p>

The levels are located according to their energy relative to the difference in energy between the lowest and highest energy states. While the lowest energy state is different for Pd or Pt, in both cases the highest energy state corresponds to two adatoms located at NNN distance (X(O)X(O)2) (0.9610 eV/atom for Pd and 1.6579 eV/atom for Pt).</p>
<p>As the coverage increases, the analysis is greatly simplified by noting that Cu(O) atoms will naturally tend to form compact islands, as seen already in the N=2 case. As a result, it is only necessary to examine configurations where the Pt(S) (or Pd) atoms are linked, in different ways, to the compact Cu(O) island. The repulsion between Pt atoms, hinted by the maximum separation in the case N=2 (see Fig. 6(c) ), would lead to configurations with low symmetry and higher energy. For example, Fig. 7 shows a representative set of configurations for N=3, covering the whole energy spectrum both for Pd and Pt. In spite of the similarities between the Pd and Pt spectra for N=1, it is clear now that at this level of coverage, the competition between the attraction of Pt(S) and Cu(O) atoms and the repulsion between Pt(S) atoms, is the driving force for the emergence of the observed ordering pattern. As expected, those configurations that maximize the distance between Pt(S) atoms are greatly favored. Not surprisingly, the lowest energy configuration corresponds to a p(2×2) pattern ( Fig. 7(a) ). The differences between Pd and Pt now become apparent, as the lack of repulsion between Pd atoms favors a c(2×2) arrangement ( Fig. 7(d) ), as hinted already in the case N=2 ( Fig. 6(a) ).</p>

Cu(S), Cu(O) and X(S) atoms are denoted with small circles, large grey disks and black disks, respectively.</p>
<p>Similar configurational analyses for N>4 indicate that the lowest energy state is a p(2×2) patch with additional Pt(S) located at distances smaller than those necessary for the continuation of a p(2×2) pattern. Not surprisingly, those bare Pt(S) atoms locate themselves in surface sites that follow, instead, a c(2×2) pattern, as can be seen in Fig. 9, where the lowest energy states for N=5, 6, and 8 are shown. This could be interpreted as if the Cu(O) island has a stabilizing effect on the formation of the p(2×2) structure for Pt but not for Pd.</p>

To characterize Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, the BFS method for alloys is applied. This method models the atomistic behavior of these surfaces, allowing for the reproduction of the observed behavior in Pd/Cu(1 0 0), Pd/Cu(1 1 0), and Cu/Pd(1 0 0) systems. By comparing the results of the Pt growth on Cu(1 0 0) with a similar process for Pd on Cu(1 0 0), the BFS method elucidates the main characteristics of the early growth stages of Pt on Cu(1 0 0). The analysis focuses on the lowest energy states and the energy level spectra at various coverages, providing insights into the growth patterns and the stabilization of surface alloys. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, contributing to advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The BFS method enables the examination of fundamental configurations and their corresponding energy level spectra at different coverages, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the growth dynamics and the formation of surface alloys. The method considers the interactions between atoms, including the strain and chemical energies, to predict the most stable configurations and the energy barriers for different growth patterns. By analyzing the energy differences between various states, the BFS method identifies the key mechanisms driving the formation of surface alloys, such as the preference for substitutional bonding over epitaxial growth and the role of compact Cu(O) islands in stabilizing the p(2×2) and c(2×2) patterns.

In summary, the BFS method provides a powerful tool for modeling and predicting the behavior of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces during the deposition process, offering insights into the complex interactions between the metals and the substrate. This knowledge is essential for advancing our understanding of the surface properties and for optimizing the performance of catalysts and other materials based on bimetallic systems.
