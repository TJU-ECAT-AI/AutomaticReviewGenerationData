[1] "The basic question to answer is what causes the observed enhanced reactivity of the copper modified region, and more precisely the shift and broadening of the hysteresis showing an optimum at a certain coverage?"

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The enhanced reactivity of the copper-modified region is attributed to the altered apparent activation energies on Pt due to the presence of copper. The activation energy for reaction decreases faster than the desorption energy with increasing copper coverage, explaining the shift and broadening of the hysteresis region.

铜修饰区域的增强反应性归因于铂上存在铜时出现的表观活化能的变化。反应的活化能下降速度比脱附能快，随着铜覆盖度增加，解释了滞回区间的位移和变宽。
