The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The experiments are conducted in a UHV chamber with various analytical tools. Copper is deposited at a temperature of 470 K. Multiple CO pressure cycles are performed on copper adlayers of varying thickness, with a cycle completion time of 30 minutes. The width of the hysteresis region changes with temperature modifications. Two primary explanations for the enhanced activity are considered: (1) the effect of adding copper as a source of increased local oxygen coverage, equivalent to an oxygen pressure increase, at the bimetallic border sites; and (2) alterations in the CO adsorption/desorption properties and surface reaction apparent activation energy due to the electronic interactions between Ni and Pt.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解和掌握这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，尤其是在先进的表面科学和催化研究领域。实验在超高真空室中进行，配备有各种分析工具。铜在470 K的温度下沉积。对不同厚度的铜包覆层进行多个CO压力循环，每个循环完成时间为30分钟。随着温度的变化，滞回宽度也会改变。两种主要的解释用于描述活性增强：（1）将铜作为增加边界区域附近局部氧覆盖率的来源，相当于增加氧压力；（2）由于Ni和Pt之间的电子相互作用导致CO吸附/脱附性质和表面反应表观活化能的改变。
