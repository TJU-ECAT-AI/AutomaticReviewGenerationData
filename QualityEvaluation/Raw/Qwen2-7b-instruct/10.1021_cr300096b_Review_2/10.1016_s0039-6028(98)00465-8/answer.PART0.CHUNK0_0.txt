<p>The specific choice of the 111 face of platinum, rather than another face, is dictated by the fact that the behavior of the Pt(111) surface in the CO oxidation is not too complex, in the sense that no oscillations but just bistabilities (hysteresis) can be observed.</p>
<p>Both kinetic phase transitions can be correlated to work function changes on the surface as recorded by photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM).</p>
<p>In the previous work using a Pt(111) surface partially covered with submonolayer quantities of Cu, emphasis was laid on the fact that Cu deposited on Pt(111) [denoted Cu/Pt(111)] could promote the establishment of a predominantly O covered surface more rapidly than pure Pt(111), and we compared the rates of progress of the reaction diffusion fronts on Cu/Pt(111) and Pt(111).</p>
<p>The purpose of the present work is to compare phase transitions (transition of CO to O and O to CO coverage) on the two systems and to understand the adsorption behavior on both kinds of surface.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the main (or macroscopically main) factor governing the activation energies of the relevant steps (adsorption, desorption, surface reaction) is the degree of Cu coverage, ΘCu.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The specific choice of the Pt(111) surface is due to its behavior in CO oxidation being relatively straightforward, involving bistabilities (hysteresis) without oscillations. Work function changes on the surface can be correlated to kinetic phase transitions, which are observed when the CO pressure is cyclically varied. In previous work, Cu was found to promote the establishment of a predominantly O-covered surface more rapidly than pure Pt(111). The current study aims to compare phase transitions on Cu/Pt(111) and Pt(111) surfaces and understand the adsorption behavior on both types of surface. The main factor influencing activation energies is the degree of Cu coverage (ΘCu).

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。选择Pt(111)表面的原因在于其在CO氧化过程中的行为相对简单，仅涉及二重稳定性（滞后）而没有振荡。工作函数变化与表面的亲核性相联系，并能与CO压力循环变化时观察到的动力学相转变相关联。在先前的工作中，发现Cu能够比纯Pt(111)更快速地促进主要氧覆盖表面的形成，并且比较了Cu/Pt(111)和纯Pt(111)表面上反应扩散前沿的速率。当前的研究目的是比较Cu/Pt(111)和纯Pt(111)表面的相转变，并理解两种表面的吸附行为。影响激活能的主要因素是Cu覆盖度（ΘCu）。
