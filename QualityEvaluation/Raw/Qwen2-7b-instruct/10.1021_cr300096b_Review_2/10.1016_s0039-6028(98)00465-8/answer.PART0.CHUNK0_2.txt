[1] "The choice of the active metals in the catalyst and the reaction were dictated by several reasons, concerning both possible relevance of results to practical catalysis and their significance in surface science."
[2] "Innumerable explanations of this effect have been given in the scientific literature 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ."
[3] "The present work is part of a group of investigations dealing with such systems composed of two parts of different composition. These are the 111 face of platinum, Pt(111), and adlayers of copper."
[4] "Considering only the surface science context, one reason for selecting platinum as one of the metals constituting the catalyst for our studies was that oxidation of CO on Pt has been extensively studied 18 ,19 ,20 ."
[5] "The basic question to answer is what causes the observed enhanced reactivity of the copper modified region, and more precisely the shift and broadening of the hysteresis showing an optimum at a certain coverage?"
[6] "The active sites are the bimetallic border sites in which mutual electronic interactions take place."
[7] "When copper is added to the surface both the reaction activation energy as well as the CO desorption activation energy decrease at the bimetallic border sites."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for detailed analysis of the interaction between the two metals and the creation of new surface states that can affect catalytic activity.

2. The enhanced reactivity of the copper-modified region is attributed to the altered apparent activation energies on Pt due to the presence of a copper adlayer. This includes both a decrease in the reaction activation energy and a faster decrease in the CO desorption activation energy with increasing copper coverage, which together describe the observed shift in the bistable region and the broadening of the hysteresis.

3. The electronic interactions at the bimetallic border sites between copper and platinum are the active sites responsible for the enhanced reactivity. These interactions lead to a decrease in the reaction activation energy and CO desorption activation energy, which collectively explain the observed phenomena.

4. The electronic modifications at the bimetallic border sites, including weakening of the COPt bond and alteration of the adsorption/desorption properties, contribute to the overall tendency of the reactivity change with increasing copper coverage.

5. The model for CO oxidation at the copper/platinum interface visualizes how CO oxidation takes place at the border between a copper-modified Pt(111) surface and pure Pt(111), highlighting the importance of the electronic interactions between copper and platinum at the bimetallic border sites.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在铂单晶或多晶铂基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于表面科学和催化研究中的结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这两类金属之间的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许对两种金属之间交互作用进行详细分析，并创建新的表面状态，这些状态可能会影响催化活性。

2. 铜改性区域增强的反应性归因于铂表面铜覆盖层导致的显着改变的反应激活能和CO脱附激活能。这包括反应激活能的降低和CO脱附激活能随铜覆盖度增加而更快地降低，共同描述了观察到的二稳态区域位移和滞回区宽度的扩展。

3. 铜和铂交界处的电子交互作用是活性位点，负责增强的反应性。这些交互作用导致反应激活能和CO脱附激活能的降低，共同解释了观察到的现象。

4. 铜铂界面处的电子修改，包括COPt键的减弱和吸附/脱附性质的变化，对铜覆盖度增加时的整体反应性变化趋势做出了贡献。

5. 铜/铂界面模型可视化了CO氧化如何在铜改性的铂（111）表面和纯铂（111）表面之间发生，强调了铜和铂交界处电子交互作用的重要性。
