[1] "In the previous work using a Pt(111) surface partially covered with submonolayer quantities of Cu, emphasis was laid on the fact that Cu deposited on Pt(111) [denoted Cu/Pt(111)] could promote the establishment of a predominantly O covered surface more rapidly than pure Pt(111), and we compared the rates of progress of the reaction diffusion fronts on Cu/Pt(111) and Pt(111)."
[2] "The purpose of the present work is to compare phase transitions (transition of CO to O and O to CO coverage) on the two systems and to understand the adsorption behavior on both kinds of surface."
[3] "The basic question to answer is what causes the observed enhanced reactivity of the copper modified region, and more precisely the shift and broadening of the hysteresis showing an optimum at a certain coverage?"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces within the realm of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The focus includes understanding the enhanced reactivity of the copper-modified region, specifically the shift and broadening of the hysteresis indicating an optimum at a certain coverage.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究领域。重点关注的是铜改性区域的增强反应性，特别是hysteresis的偏移和展宽，这表明存在一个特定的覆盖度下的最优点。
