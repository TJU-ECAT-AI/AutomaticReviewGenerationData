<p>The specific choice of the 111 face of platinum, rather than another face, is dictated by the fact that the behavior of the Pt(111) surface in the CO oxidation is not too complex, in the sense that no oscillations but just bistabilities (hysteresis) can be observed.</p>
<p>Both kinetic phase transitions can be correlated to work function changes on the surface as recorded by photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM).</p>
<p>In the previous work using a Pt(111) surface partially covered with submonolayer quantities of Cu, emphasis was laid on the fact that Cu deposited on Pt(111) [denoted Cu/Pt(111)] could promote the establishment of a predominantly O covered surface more rapidly than pure Pt(111), and we compared the rates of progress of the reaction diffusion fronts on Cu/Pt(111) and Pt(111).</p>
<p>The purpose of the present work is to compare phase transitions (transition of CO to O and O to CO coverage) on the two systems and to understand the adsorption behavior on both kinds of surface.</p>
<p>Let us assume that the main (or macroscopically main) factor governing the activation energies of the relevant steps (adsorption, desorption, surface reaction) is the degree of Cu coverage, ΘCu.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The specific choice of the Pt(111) surface is due to its behavior in CO oxidation being relatively straightforward, involving bistabilities (hysteresis) without oscillations. Work function changes on the surface can be correlated to kinetic phase transitions, which are observed when the CO pressure is cyclically varied. In previous work, Cu was found to promote the establishment of a predominantly O-covered surface more rapidly than pure Pt(111). The current study aims to compare phase transitions on Cu/Pt(111) and Pt(111) surfaces and understand the adsorption behavior on both types of surface. The main factor influencing activation energies is the degree of Cu coverage (ΘCu).

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。选择Pt(111)表面的原因在于其在CO氧化过程中的行为相对简单，仅涉及二重稳定性（滞后）而没有振荡。工作函数变化与表面的亲核性相联系，并能与CO压力循环变化时观察到的动力学相转变相关联。在先前的工作中，发现Cu能够比纯Pt(111)更快速地促进主要氧覆盖表面的形成，并且比较了Cu/Pt(111)和纯Pt(111)表面上反应扩散前沿的速率。当前的研究目的是比较Cu/Pt(111)和纯Pt(111)表面的相转变，并理解两种表面的吸附行为。影响激活能的主要因素是Cu覆盖度（ΘCu）。

[1] "The basic question to answer is what causes the observed enhanced reactivity of the copper modified region, and more precisely the shift and broadening of the hysteresis showing an optimum at a certain coverage?"
</quotes>
<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The enhanced reactivity of the copper-modified region is attributed to the altered apparent activation energies on Pt due to the presence of copper. The activation energy for reaction decreases faster than the desorption energy with increasing copper coverage, explaining the shift and broadening of the hysteresis region.

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for detailed analysis of the interaction between the two metals and the creation of new surface states that can affect catalytic activity.

2. The enhanced reactivity of the copper-modified region is attributed to the altered apparent activation energies on Pt due to the presence of a copper adlayer. This includes both a decrease in the reaction activation energy and a faster decrease in the CO desorption activation energy with increasing copper coverage, which together describe the observed shift in the bistable region and the broadening of the hysteresis.

3. The electronic interactions at the bimetallic border sites between copper and platinum are the active sites responsible for the enhanced reactivity. These interactions lead to a decrease in the reaction activation energy and CO desorption activation energy, which collectively explain the observed phenomena.

4. The electronic modifications at the bimetallic border sites, including weakening of the COPt bond and alteration of the adsorption/desorption properties, contribute to the overall tendency of the reactivity change with increasing copper coverage.

5. The model for CO oxidation at the copper/platinum interface visualizes how CO oxidation takes place at the border between a copper-modified Pt(111) surface and pure Pt(111), highlighting the importance of the electronic interactions between copper and platinum at the bimetallic border sites.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在铂单晶或多晶铂基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于表面科学和催化研究中的结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这两类金属之间的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许对两种金属之间交互作用进行详细分析，并创建新的表面状态，这些状态可能会影响催化活性。

2. 铜改性区域增强的反应性归因于铂表面铜覆盖层导致的显着改变的反应激活能和CO脱附激活能。这包括反应激活能的降低和CO脱附激活能随铜覆盖度增加而更快地降低，共同描述了观察到的二稳态区域位移和滞回区宽度的扩展。

3. 铜和铂交界处的电子交互作用是活性位点，负责增强的反应性。这些交互作用导致反应激活能和CO脱附激活能的降低，共同解释了观察到的现象。

4. 铜铂界面处的电子修改，包括COPt键的减弱和吸附/脱附性质的变化，对铜覆盖度增加时的整体反应性变化趋势做出了贡献。

5. 铜/铂界面模型可视化了CO氧化如何在铜改性的铂（111）表面和纯铂（111）表面之间发生，强调了铜和铂交界处电子交互作用的重要性。

<p>The experiments were performed in a stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with devices for low energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), mass spectrometry (MS) and photoelectron emission microscopy (PEEM).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The experiments are conducted in a UHV chamber with various analytical tools. Copper is deposited at a temperature of 470 K. Multiple CO pressure cycles are performed on copper adlayers of varying thickness, with a cycle completion time of 30 minutes. The width of the hysteresis region changes with temperature modifications. Two primary explanations for the enhanced activity are considered: (1) the effect of adding copper as a source of increased local oxygen coverage, equivalent to an oxygen pressure increase, at the bimetallic border sites; and (2) alterations in the CO adsorption/desorption properties and surface reaction apparent activation energy due to the electronic interactions between Ni and Pt.
