The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The step density plays a significant role in determining the morphology and growth mode of the deposited layers. A low step density leads to a rough film morphology, while a high step density on a vicinal surface promotes the formation of a flat monolayer and suppresses three-dimensional growth up to monolayer completion.

<p>Fe incorporation into the substrate terrace e.g. through exchange at the step-edge would expel a Pt atom which can, hence, migrate and attach to an existing kink site. As a result oscillations of defect density at the step-edge would exhibit an increased period when the mobility increases.</p>
<p>It is known that Pt atoms at the step-edge are mobile already at T = 400 K as Pt evaporation on Pt(9 9 7) at this temperature proceeds without intensity decrease in grazing helium scattering.</p>
<p>The formation of the Fe monolayer also suggests the absence of significant FePt intermixing. For evaporation at T  400 K the intensity as a function of coverage follows a parabolic curve typical for layer-by-layer growth.</p>
<p>In contrast to these morphological transitions, we will show that the formation of a surface alloy is in good agreement with observation and represents the most convincing picture to explain the reflectivity curves in the temperature range 500550 K in Fig. 3 .</p>
<p>At 500 K and 550 K we may observe a growing Fe monolayer with a different lattice structure than at lower temperature.</p>
<p>Only during continued Fe deposition the reflectivity increases and approaches the behavior of the 550 K curve. This suggests that the first Fe row decorating the step-edge forms a metastable structure and becomes incorporated into an alloy only during continued Fe deposition.</p>
<p>For comparison, the FePt alloy on Pt(1 1 1) exhibits domains of parallel Fe rows alternating with Pt rows with a strong tendency for local ordering but a high density of domain walls between antiphase domains and domains of different azimuthal row orientation.</p>
<p>With respect to the time required to deposit one Fe row the recovery at 450 K is thus still slow while it is already fast at 500 K. This suggests a substantial activation energy.</p>

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface structure and composition, facilitating detailed analysis and prediction of their behavior and interactions.
2. The low step density of the Pt(111) surface leads to a rough film morphology when Ni is deposited. In contrast, the vicinal surface used in this study promotes the formation of a flat monolayer of Ni and inhibits three-dimensional growth, at least up to monolayer completion. This is due to the high density of high coordination sites for Ni atoms on the vicinal surface, which facilitates attachment to steps rather than terrace sites or the edges of Ni islands, leading to a more uniform surface structure.

2. Pt(111)表面的低台阶密度导致Ni沉积时形成粗糙的薄膜形态。相比之下，本研究中使用的侧向表面促进了Ni单层的平滑形成，并抑制了三维生长，至少直到完成单层。这是由于侧向表面高协调位点的高密度，使得Ni原子更倾向于附着到台阶而不是台面或Ni岛屿边缘，导致更均匀的表面结构。

2. The study emphasizes that the vicinal surface promotes the formation of a flat monolayer and inhibits three-dimensional growth up to monolayer completion, compared to the Pt(1 1 1) surface which tends to produce a rough film morphology. This is due to the higher step density and coordination sites on the vicinal surface, which facilitate more efficient attachment of atoms to steps and reduce the residence time of single adatoms.

2. 研究强调，与Pt(1 1 1)表面相比，侧向表面促进了形成平单层并抑制了三维生长至单层完成。这是由于侧向表面更高的台阶密度和配位点，这使得原子更有效地附着到台阶上，并减少了单个吸附原子的停留时间。
