<p>Fe incorporation into the substrate terrace e.g. through exchange at the step-edge would expel a Pt atom which can, hence, migrate and attach to an existing kink site. As a result oscillations of defect density at the step-edge would exhibit an increased period when the mobility increases.</p>
<p>It is known that Pt atoms at the step-edge are mobile already at T = 400 K as Pt evaporation on Pt(9 9 7) at this temperature proceeds without intensity decrease in grazing helium scattering.</p>
<p>The formation of the Fe monolayer also suggests the absence of significant FePt intermixing. For evaporation at T  400 K the intensity as a function of coverage follows a parabolic curve typical for layer-by-layer growth.</p>
<p>In contrast to these morphological transitions, we will show that the formation of a surface alloy is in good agreement with observation and represents the most convincing picture to explain the reflectivity curves in the temperature range 500550 K in Fig. 3 .</p>
<p>At 500 K and 550 K we may observe a growing Fe monolayer with a different lattice structure than at lower temperature.</p>
<p>Only during continued Fe deposition the reflectivity increases and approaches the behavior of the 550 K curve. This suggests that the first Fe row decorating the step-edge forms a metastable structure and becomes incorporated into an alloy only during continued Fe deposition.</p>
<p>For comparison, the FePt alloy on Pt(1 1 1) exhibits domains of parallel Fe rows alternating with Pt rows with a strong tendency for local ordering but a high density of domain walls between antiphase domains and domains of different azimuthal row orientation.</p>
<p>With respect to the time required to deposit one Fe row the recovery at 450 K is thus still slow while it is already fast at 500 K. This suggests a substantial activation energy.</p>
