[1] "Comparison of our results to studies on the growth of Fe on Pt(1 1 1) demonstrates that a low step density provides a rough film morphology whereas the vicinal surface employed in this study promotes formation of a flat monolayer and suppresses three-dimensional growth at least up to monolayer completion."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The step density plays a significant role in determining the morphology and growth mode of the deposited layers. A low step density leads to a rough film morphology, while a high step density on a vicinal surface promotes the formation of a flat monolayer and suppresses three-dimensional growth up to monolayer completion.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。台阶密度在决定沉积层的形态和生长模式方面起着重要作用。低台阶密度导致粗糙的薄膜形态，而高台阶密度在斜面表面上促进形成平坦的单层，并抑制三维生长至单层完成。
