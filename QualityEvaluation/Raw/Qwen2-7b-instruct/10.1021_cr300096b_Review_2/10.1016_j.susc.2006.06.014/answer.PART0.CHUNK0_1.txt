The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The low step density of the Pt(111) surface leads to a rough film morphology, whereas the vicinal surface promotes the formation of a flat monolayer and suppresses three-dimensional growth, at least up to monolayer completion. Bulk and surface alloy formation occur on both flat and vicinal surfaces, but they become activated at temperatures that are 100-150 K lower on the vicinal surface.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面了解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。Pt(111)表面的低台阶密度导致粗糙的薄膜形态，而斜面表面则促进形成平坦的单层并抑制三维生长，至少直到完成单层。在平表面和平面表面上，块体和表面合金化都会发生，但它们在斜面表面上激活的温度要低100-150K。
