[1] "Comparison of our results to studies on the growth of Fe on Pt(1 1 1) demonstrates that a low step density provides a rough film morphology whereas the vicinal surface employed in this study promotes formation of a flat monolayer and suppresses three-dimensional growth at least up to monolayer completion."
[2] "The residence time of single adatoms on the terraces is reduced with respect to Pt(1 1 1) and their attachment to steps is enforced especially for coverages below 1 ML."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface structure and composition, facilitating detailed analysis and prediction of their behavior and interactions.
2. The low step density of the Pt(111) surface leads to a rough film morphology when Ni is deposited. In contrast, the vicinal surface used in this study promotes the formation of a flat monolayer of Ni and inhibits three-dimensional growth, at least up to monolayer completion. This is due to the high density of high coordination sites for Ni atoms on the vicinal surface, which facilitates attachment to steps rather than terrace sites or the edges of Ni islands, leading to a more uniform surface structure.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许对表面结构和组成进行精确控制，从而促进详细的分析和预测其行为和相互作用。
2. Pt(111)表面的低台阶密度导致Ni沉积时形成粗糙的薄膜形态。相比之下，本研究中使用的侧向表面促进了Ni单层的平滑形成，并抑制了三维生长，至少直到完成单层。这是由于侧向表面高协调位点的高密度，使得Ni原子更倾向于附着到台阶而不是台面或Ni岛屿边缘，导致更均匀的表面结构。
