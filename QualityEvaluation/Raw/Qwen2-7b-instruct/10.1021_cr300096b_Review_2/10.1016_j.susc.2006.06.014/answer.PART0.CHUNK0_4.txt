[1] "Comparison of our results to studies on the growth of Fe on Pt(1 1 1) demonstrates that a low step density provides a rough film morphology whereas the vicinal surface employed in this study promotes formation of a flat monolayer and suppresses three-dimensional growth at least up to monolayer completion."
[2] "Bulk alloying occurs for T ≥ 600 K which is shown by Auger electron spectroscopy."
[3] "The residence time of single adatoms on the terraces is reduced with respect to Pt(1 1 1) and their attachment to steps is enforced especially for coverages below 1 ML."
[4] "Comparison of our results to studies on the growth of Fe on Pt(1 1 1) demonstrates that a low step density provides a rough film morphology whereas the vicinal surface employed in this study promotes formation of a flat monolayer and suppresses three-dimensional growth at least up to monolayer completion."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to control the interface properties and interactions between the Ni and Pt layers, which significantly affect the surface reactivity and catalytic activity.

2. The study emphasizes that the vicinal surface promotes the formation of a flat monolayer and inhibits three-dimensional growth up to monolayer completion, compared to the Pt(1 1 1) surface which tends to produce a rough film morphology. This is due to the higher step density and coordination sites on the vicinal surface, which facilitate more efficient attachment of atoms to steps and reduce the residence time of single adatoms.

2. 研究强调，与Pt(1 1 1)表面相比，侧向表面促进了形成平单层并抑制了三维生长至单层完成。这是由于侧向表面更高的台阶密度和配位点，这使得原子更有效地附着到台阶上，并减少了单个吸附原子的停留时间。
