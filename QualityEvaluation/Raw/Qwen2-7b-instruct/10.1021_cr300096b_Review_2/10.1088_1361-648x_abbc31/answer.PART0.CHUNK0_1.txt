[1] "Two magnetic properties, obtained by subtracting measurements made at opposite fields, have the same onset at small delays and different relaxations at large delays."
[2] "The different dynamics suggests that spin relaxation in ultrafast demagnetization is a combination of two processes."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface composition and structure. This precision is essential for accurately predicting and explaining the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces in various applications, such as catalytic reactions.
