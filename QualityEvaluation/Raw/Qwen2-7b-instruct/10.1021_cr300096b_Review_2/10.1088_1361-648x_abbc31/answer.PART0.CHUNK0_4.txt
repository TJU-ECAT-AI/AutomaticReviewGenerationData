[1] "Two magnetic properties, obtained by subtracting measurements made at opposite fields, have the same onset at small delays and different relaxations at large delays."
[2] "The different dynamics suggests that spin relaxation in ultrafast demagnetization is a combination of two processes."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for the structural modeling and DFT calculations of these surfaces. It helps in comprehensively understanding their electronic and chemical properties, which are essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
