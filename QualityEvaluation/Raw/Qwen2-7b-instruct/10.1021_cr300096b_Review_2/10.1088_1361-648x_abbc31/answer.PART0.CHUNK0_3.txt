[1] "Two magnetic properties, obtained by subtracting measurements made at opposite fields, have the same onset at small delays and different relaxations at large delays."
[2] "The different dynamics suggests that spin relaxation in ultrafast demagnetization is a combination of two processes."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The reason lies in the ability to precisely control and manipulate the composition and structure of the surfaces, enabling detailed analysis through computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT). These surfaces are of significant interest in advanced surface science and catalysis research due to their potential applications in various industrial processes, including catalytic reactions and energy conversion technologies.
