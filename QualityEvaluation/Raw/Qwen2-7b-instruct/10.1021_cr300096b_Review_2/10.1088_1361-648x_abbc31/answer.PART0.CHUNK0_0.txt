[1] "Two magnetic properties, obtained by subtracting measurements made at opposite fields, have the same onset at small delays and different relaxations at large delays."
[2] "The different dynamics suggests that spin relaxation in ultrafast demagnetization is a combination of two processes."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows for a detailed understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, this approach enables scientists to predict and optimize the performance of catalysts based on the specific surface properties of the bimetallic system.
