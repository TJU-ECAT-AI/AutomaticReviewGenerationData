<p>Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. We explain this growth mode by an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction.</p>
<p>Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces. The diffusion of Ag is limited to the surface layer.</p>
<p>Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: (i) Site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and (ii) vacancy mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. This process involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) surface, which allows for the creation of a bimetallic interface with specific properties that can be tailored for various applications in catalysis and surface science. The detailed characterization of such surfaces through techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations helps in understanding the structure-property relationships, interfacial interactions, and the electronic and chemical functionalities of the bimetallic system. This knowledge is essential for designing materials with optimized catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability for various industrial and environmental applications.
