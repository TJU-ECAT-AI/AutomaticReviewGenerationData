<p>Experiments were performed in an UHV chamber that was equipped with a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for AES, rear-view low energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics, a quadrupole mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), homebuilt single-piezo-tube STM, ion-gun for sample cleaning, resistively heated Ag-evaporation source, and precision-leak valves for gas dosing.</p>
<p>The cleanliness of the sample was monitored by AES and the procedure was repeated until no contamination at the surface could be detected.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, i.e., after annealing to 800 K, Ag and Pt form a surface alloy confined to the topmost layer only. With increasing Ag content, Pt is replaced by Ag in the surface layer until a complete pseudomorphic Ag layer forms.</p>
<p>Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) studies indicate a reversible mixing of Ag with Pt at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>We explain the shape of these structures as a consequence of the spreading and alloying of Ag from the adislands described above.</p>
<p>No significant change in the AES signal was observed, indicating that there is no substantial Ag diffusion into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a series of experimental techniques including AES, LEED optics, TPD, STM, and an ion-gun for sample cleaning. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows for the precise determination of the surface composition and structure. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces is essential for optimizing catalytic activity and performance. The AES technique is particularly useful in monitoring the reversible mixing of Ni and Pt at elevated temperatures, providing insights into the dynamic interactions between the two metals. The observed structures, such as the spreading of the alloyed region upon annealing, can be explained by the alloying process occurring at the perimeter of the adislands, followed by its spreading across the surface. This process leads to a nanophasic AgPt alloy, which is confined to the surface layer, but limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt is observed at higher temperatures. The AES signal's temperature dependence suggests that diffusion processes are involved, with one being a fast, reversible process related to site exchange between Ni and Pt in the first and second layers, while another involves vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion of Ni in the subsurface region. The reversible nature of the AES signal's response upon changing the sample temperature indicates the entropic contribution to the free energy in the system, influencing the mixing and disordering of the surface.

通过一系列实验技术，包括AES、LEED光学、TPD、STM和离子枪进行样品清洁，对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行了表征。这一过程对于结构建模和第一性原理计算至关重要，因为它允许精确确定表面组成和结构。在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下，理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质对于优化催化活性和性能至关重要。AES技术特别适用于监测Ni和Pt在高温下的可逆混合，提供了两种金属之间动态相互作用的洞察。观察到的结构，如合金区域在退火后的扩展形状，可以解释为合金化过程发生在岛边缘周围，随后在整个表面上扩散。这导致纳米相的AgPt合金，仅限于表面层，但在较高温度下观察到Ag向基体Pt晶粒的有限溶解。AES信号的温度依赖性表明涉及扩散过程，其中一个过程是快速、可逆的过程，与第一和第二层中的Ni和Pt位点交换有关，而另一个过程涉及空位介导的Ni在亚表面区域的基体扩散。AES信号响应温度变化的可逆性质表明系统中熵的贡献，影响表面的混合作用和混乱程度。
