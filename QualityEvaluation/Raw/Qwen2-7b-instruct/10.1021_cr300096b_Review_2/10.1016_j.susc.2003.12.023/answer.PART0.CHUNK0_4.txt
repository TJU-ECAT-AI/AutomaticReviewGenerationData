[1] "Heteroepitaxy of metals and alloying of metals at interfaces is of continuing interest for both fundamental studies and applications that involve multielement, structured materials."
[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal."
[3] "This process appears to be mainly entropy driven. Increasing configurational disorder (mixing) at elevated temperatures reduces the free energy of the system and upon cooling a lowering of the free energy by increasing the Ag content in the surface layer is obtained."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. This process helps in understanding the interactions between Ni and Pt, the formation of interfacial phases, and the influence of the interface on the overall surface properties. It enables researchers to predict the behavior of these surfaces under various conditions, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
