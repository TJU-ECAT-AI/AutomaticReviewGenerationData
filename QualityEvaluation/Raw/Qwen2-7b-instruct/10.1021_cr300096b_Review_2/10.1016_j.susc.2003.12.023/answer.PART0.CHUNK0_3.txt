3.1. Room temperature growth
"The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction. Furthermore, it appears that the islands preferentially terminate along the troughs of the reconstruction."

3.2. Surface evolution with annealing temperature
"In summary, we conclude that the anisotropic island shape with straight island edges is due to an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction of the substrate that always results in the lifting of the reconstruction across the full width of the unit cell describing the reconstruction."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The anisotropic island shape with straight island edges during room temperature growth on Pt(100) surface is due to an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction that leads to the lifting of the reconstruction across the full width of the unit cell. This phenomenon might also be expected on (100) hex-reconstructed surfaces, such as Pt, Au, and Ir, for a variety of deposited materials.

通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层来表征Ni/Pt双金属表面。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。室温生长在Pt(100)表面上的岛状形状具有直边，是因为六面体重构的各向异性稳定性导致了在描述重构的单元格宽度上的重构提升。这种现象可能也预期在Pt、Au和Ir等（100）六面体重构表面上，对于各种沉积材料而言都是如此。
