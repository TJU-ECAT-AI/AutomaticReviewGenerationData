<p>The morphology of the surface following Ag deposition on a Pt(1 0 0)-hex substrate is described and discussed below. In Section 3.1, we describe the structure that evolves upon silver deposition at 300400 K. As the sample is annealed to higher temperatures, the surface evolves from a kinetically trapped structure to the thermodynamic equilibrium structure dictated by energy minimization. This is described in Section 3.2 both by STM studies after re-cooling of the sample to 300 K as well as temperature-dependent AES studies that reveal variations in the Ag concentration close to the surface.</p>
<p>STM images after the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface reveal extended 2D islands, as shown in Fig. 1. These islands are separated by the hex-reconstructed Pt substrate. The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction. Furthermore, it appears that the islands preferentially terminate along the troughs of the reconstruction. STM images on top of the islands, as shown in Fig. 1(b), exhibit corrugations of 0.05 nm. This is significantly less than the atomic step height and can be attributed to incorporated Pt atoms in a Ag matrix.</p>
<p>We can construct the scenario that is displayed schematically in Fig. 2 from the STM data. At room temperature, nucleation of adislands on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface proceeds by lifting of the hex-reconstruction. This provides additional Pt that is incorporated into the growing islands to form a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80. The anisotropic island shape indicates island growth that is faster along the rows of the reconstruction than normal to them.</p>
<p>In summary, we conclude that the anisotropic island shape with straight island edges is due to an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction of the substrate that always results in the lifting of the reconstruction across the full width of the unit cell describing the reconstruction.</p>
<p>Annealing of submonolayer-Ag deposits on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface to 600 K for 10 s results in a change of the surface morphology compared to that obtained following deposition. STM images characterizing such annealed surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3. The islands are still clearly visible, however, the island edges are no longer as straight as they were after room temperature growth. Inspection of the substrate adjacent to the island edges shows that the characteristic row structure of the hex-reconstruction has retreated from the island edges.</p>
<p>Fig. 5(a) shows an image from a sample with 0.5-ML Ag that has been annealed to 600 K. Fig. 5(b) show an image from a similar sample with 0.4-ML Ag that was annealed to 900 K. From these large-scale STM images it is apparent that the surface morphology has also changed on this length scale compared to clean Pt(1 0 0).</p>
<p>The influence of temperature was investigated by AES for samples with two different initial Ag coverages. The Ag(351,356) peak-to-peak AES intensity was monitored and plotted either against elapsed time after reaching a certain high temperature or against the temperature for constant heating rates.</p>
<p>Experiments in which samples with 1-ML Ag were heated rapidly to a target temperature and then kept constant at this value are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). In Fig. 6(c), the sample was heated to 600 K and then kept constant at this temperature for 950 s. The Ag AES intensity remained unchanged during this time. Subsequent heating to 800 K resulted in a decrease in the Ag signal. Keeping the temperature constant at this value causes a further decrease in the Ag signal.</p>

This passage discusses the growth of silver films on a reconstructed platinum (1 0 0) surface. It highlights the formation of elongated 2D islands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 at room temperature, resulting from the lifting of the hex-reconstruction and the incorporation of additional platinum atoms into the islands. The islands show strong anisotropy along the rows of the hex-reconstruction, with edges that are very straight. Annealing at higher temperatures leads to the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, starting at the perimeter of the islands and spreading across the surface. The AES studies reveal variations in the Ag concentration close to the surface, indicating limited dissolution of Ag into the bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. The passage also mentions the use of STM images and AES techniques to characterize the surface morphology and composition changes with annealing temperature, providing insights into the kinetic and thermodynamic processes involved in the growth and alloying of silver on platinum surfaces.

这段文字讨论了在重构的铂（1 0 0）表面生长银薄膜的情况。它强调了在室温下形成长度为Ag80Pt20的2D岛屿，这是由于六边形重构的提升以及进入岛屿的额外铂原子导致的。岛屿沿着六边形重构的行显示出强烈的各向异性，并且边缘非常直。高温退火导致形成纳米相态的AgPt合金，从岛屿的边缘开始，并在整个表面上扩散。AES研究显示了表面附近Ag浓度的变化，表明在高温下Ag部分溶解到基体Pt中。该段落还提到了使用扫描隧道显微镜图像和AES技术来表征随退火温度变化的表面形态和组成变化，提供了关于银在铂表面上生长和合金化过程中的动力学和热力学过程的见解。
