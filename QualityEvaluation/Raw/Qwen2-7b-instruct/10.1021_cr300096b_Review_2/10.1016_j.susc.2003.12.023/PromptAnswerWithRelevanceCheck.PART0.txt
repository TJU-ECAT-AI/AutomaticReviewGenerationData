<p>Experiments were performed in an UHV chamber that was equipped with a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for AES, rear-view low energy electron diffraction (LEED) optics, a quadrupole mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), homebuilt single-piezo-tube STM, ion-gun for sample cleaning, resistively heated Ag-evaporation source, and precision-leak valves for gas dosing.</p>
<p>The cleanliness of the sample was monitored by AES and the procedure was repeated until no contamination at the surface could be detected.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, i.e., after annealing to 800 K, Ag and Pt form a surface alloy confined to the topmost layer only. With increasing Ag content, Pt is replaced by Ag in the surface layer until a complete pseudomorphic Ag layer forms.</p>
<p>Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) studies indicate a reversible mixing of Ag with Pt at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>We explain the shape of these structures as a consequence of the spreading and alloying of Ag from the adislands described above.</p>
<p>No significant change in the AES signal was observed, indicating that there is no substantial Ag diffusion into the subsurface region even at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>For a pseudomorphic Ag-monolayer, on the other hand, intermixing of Ag and Pt between the surface layer and the Pt substrate has to occur to increase configurational disorder in the surface layer.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a series of experimental techniques including AES, LEED optics, TPD, STM, and an ion-gun for sample cleaning. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows for the precise determination of the surface composition and structure. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces is essential for optimizing catalytic activity and performance. The AES technique is particularly useful in monitoring the reversible mixing of Ni and Pt at elevated temperatures, providing insights into the dynamic interactions between the two metals. The observed structures, such as the spreading of the alloyed region upon annealing, can be explained by the alloying process occurring at the perimeter of the adislands, followed by its spreading across the surface. This process leads to a nanophasic AgPt alloy, which is confined to the surface layer, but limited dissolution of Ag into bulk Pt is observed at higher temperatures. The AES signal's temperature dependence suggests that diffusion processes are involved, with one being a fast, reversible process related to site exchange between Ni and Pt in the first and second layers, while another involves vacancy-mediated bulk diffusion of Ni in the subsurface region. The reversible nature of the AES signal's response upon changing the sample temperature indicates the entropic contribution to the free energy in the system, influencing the mixing and disordering of the surface.

通过一系列实验技术，包括AES、LEED光学、TPD、STM和离子枪进行样品清洁，对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行了表征。这一过程对于结构建模和第一性原理计算至关重要，因为它允许精确确定表面组成和结构。在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下，理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质对于优化催化活性和性能至关重要。AES技术特别适用于监测Ni和Pt在高温下的可逆混合，提供了两种金属之间动态相互作用的洞察。观察到的结构，如合金区域在退火后的扩展形状，可以解释为合金化过程发生在岛边缘周围，随后在整个表面上扩散。这导致纳米相的AgPt合金，仅限于表面层，但在较高温度下观察到Ag向基体Pt晶粒的有限溶解。AES信号的温度依赖性表明涉及扩散过程，其中一个过程是快速、可逆的过程，与第一和第二层中的Ni和Pt位点交换有关，而另一个过程涉及空位介导的Ni在亚表面区域的基体扩散。AES信号响应温度变化的可逆性质表明系统中熵的贡献，影响表面的混合作用和混乱程度。

<p>The morphology of the surface following Ag deposition on a Pt(1 0 0)-hex substrate is described and discussed below. In Section 3.1, we describe the structure that evolves upon silver deposition at 300400 K. As the sample is annealed to higher temperatures, the surface evolves from a kinetically trapped structure to the thermodynamic equilibrium structure dictated by energy minimization. This is described in Section 3.2 both by STM studies after re-cooling of the sample to 300 K as well as temperature-dependent AES studies that reveal variations in the Ag concentration close to the surface.</p>
<p>STM images after the deposition of submonolayer amounts of Ag on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface reveal extended 2D islands, as shown in Fig. 1. These islands are separated by the hex-reconstructed Pt substrate. The islands show strong anisotropic shapes with an elongation along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. Island edges are very straight over several 100 nm and run along the rows of the reconstruction. Furthermore, it appears that the islands preferentially terminate along the troughs of the reconstruction. STM images on top of the islands, as shown in Fig. 1(b), exhibit corrugations of 0.05 nm. This is significantly less than the atomic step height and can be attributed to incorporated Pt atoms in a Ag matrix.</p>
<p>We can construct the scenario that is displayed schematically in Fig. 2 from the STM data. At room temperature, nucleation of adislands on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface proceeds by lifting of the hex-reconstruction. This provides additional Pt that is incorporated into the growing islands to form a disordered alloy with a composition close to Pt20Ag80. The anisotropic island shape indicates island growth that is faster along the rows of the reconstruction than normal to them.</p>
<p>In summary, we conclude that the anisotropic island shape with straight island edges is due to an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction of the substrate that always results in the lifting of the reconstruction across the full width of the unit cell describing the reconstruction.</p>
<p>Annealing of submonolayer-Ag deposits on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface to 600 K for 10 s results in a change of the surface morphology compared to that obtained following deposition. STM images characterizing such annealed surfaces are displayed in Fig. 3. The islands are still clearly visible, however, the island edges are no longer as straight as they were after room temperature growth. Inspection of the substrate adjacent to the island edges shows that the characteristic row structure of the hex-reconstruction has retreated from the island edges.</p>
<p>Fig. 5(a) shows an image from a sample with 0.5-ML Ag that has been annealed to 600 K. Fig. 5(b) show an image from a similar sample with 0.4-ML Ag that was annealed to 900 K. From these large-scale STM images it is apparent that the surface morphology has also changed on this length scale compared to clean Pt(1 0 0).</p>
<p>The influence of temperature was investigated by AES for samples with two different initial Ag coverages. The Ag(351,356) peak-to-peak AES intensity was monitored and plotted either against elapsed time after reaching a certain high temperature or against the temperature for constant heating rates.</p>
<p>Experiments in which samples with 1-ML Ag were heated rapidly to a target temperature and then kept constant at this value are shown in Fig. 6(c) and (d). In Fig. 6(c), the sample was heated to 600 K and then kept constant at this temperature for 950 s. The Ag AES intensity remained unchanged during this time. Subsequent heating to 800 K resulted in a decrease in the Ag signal. Keeping the temperature constant at this value causes a further decrease in the Ag signal.</p>

This passage discusses the growth of silver films on a reconstructed platinum (1 0 0) surface. It highlights the formation of elongated 2D islands with a composition of Ag80Pt20 at room temperature, resulting from the lifting of the hex-reconstruction and the incorporation of additional platinum atoms into the islands. The islands show strong anisotropy along the rows of the hex-reconstruction, with edges that are very straight. Annealing at higher temperatures leads to the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy, starting at the perimeter of the islands and spreading across the surface. The AES studies reveal variations in the Ag concentration close to the surface, indicating limited dissolution of Ag into the bulk Pt at elevated temperatures. The passage also mentions the use of STM images and AES techniques to characterize the surface morphology and composition changes with annealing temperature, providing insights into the kinetic and thermodynamic processes involved in the growth and alloying of silver on platinum surfaces.

这段文字讨论了在重构的铂（1 0 0）表面生长银薄膜的情况。它强调了在室温下形成长度为Ag80Pt20的2D岛屿，这是由于六边形重构的提升以及进入岛屿的额外铂原子导致的。岛屿沿着六边形重构的行显示出强烈的各向异性，并且边缘非常直。高温退火导致形成纳米相态的AgPt合金，从岛屿的边缘开始，并在整个表面上扩散。AES研究显示了表面附近Ag浓度的变化，表明在高温下Ag部分溶解到基体Pt中。该段落还提到了使用扫描隧道显微镜图像和AES技术来表征随退火温度变化的表面形态和组成变化，提供了关于银在铂表面上生长和合金化过程中的动力学和热力学过程的见解。

<p>Initial Ag growth on Pt(1 0 0)-hex at 300 K is strongly influenced by the surface reconstruction of the Pt crystal. Adisland-growth proceeds in elongated structures along the rows of the hex-reconstruction. We explain this growth mode by an anisotropic stability of the hex-reconstruction.</p>
<p>Annealing of the adisland structure above 600 K results in the formation of a nanophasic AgPt alloy. The alloy formation starts at the perimeter of the adislands and spreads across the surface by exchanging Ag from the adislands with Pt from the adjacent lower terraces. The diffusion of Ag is limited to the surface layer.</p>
<p>Two processes for Ag diffusion are proposed to explain the temporal response of the AES signal upon changing the sample temperature: (i) Site exchange between Ag and Pt in the first and second layer, respectively, and (ii) vacancy mediated bulk diffusion processes of Ag in the subsurface region.</p>

[1] "Heteroepitaxy of metals and alloying of metals at interfaces is of continuing interest for both fundamental studies and applications that involve multielement, structured materials."
[2] "Experimentally, it was found that the intermixed AgPt(1 1 1) alloy was confined to the topmost layer, with no Ag diffusion into the bulk of the Pt crystal."
[3] "This process appears to be mainly entropy driven. Increasing configurational disorder (mixing) at elevated temperatures reduces the free energy of the system and upon cooling a lowering of the free energy by increasing the Ag content in the surface layer is obtained."
