[2] "The intensity of the specular beam of LEED varying with annealing time plus the Auger signals of Ag and Pt function of temperatures show that a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K."

The characterization of the annealing effect on Ag films on Pt(111) surfaces was conducted using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). These techniques revealed that the structure of the surface undergoes a change between 550 and 650 K in a submonolayer range, as evidenced by the abnormal change in the intensities of the specular beam of LEED. This change indicates the formation of a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K. Additionally, the analysis of the UP spectra showed that the d band and the Fermi edge have some interesting changes during the growth process. The UPS results also suggested that Ag and Pt atoms mix on the top layer to form a 2D surface alloy at the specified temperature and coverage range.

对Ag薄膜在Pt(111)表面上的退火效果的表征使用了低能电子衍射（LEED）、俄歇电子谱和紫外光电子谱（UPS）。这些技术表明，在550至650 K的亚单层范围内，表面结构发生了变化，这从LEED发散束的强度异常变化中得到证据。这种变化表明，在600至700 K的温度范围内形成了一个无序的二维（2D）AgPt合金。此外，UP谱的分析显示，在生长过程中，d带和费米边缘有一些有趣的变化。UPS的结果还表明，Ag和Pt原子在顶层混合形成一个2D表面合金，处于指定的温度和覆盖范围。
