[1] "The intensities of the specular beam of LEED versus temperature have abnormal change between 550 and 650 K in a submonolayer range."
[2] "The intensity of the specular beam of LEED varying with annealing time plus the Auger signals of Ag and Pt function of temperatures show that a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K."
[3] "UP spectra in the growth process show that the d band and the Fermi edge have some interesting changes."
[4] "On the other hand, UPS in the annealing process also strongly suggests that Ag and Pt atoms mix on the top layer to form a 2D surface alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K and a coverage in the submonolayer range."

The characterization of the annealing effect on Ag films on Pt(111) surfaces was conducted using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). These techniques revealed that the structure of the surface undergoes a change between 550 and 650 K in a submonolayer range, as evidenced by the abnormal change in the intensities of the specular beam of LEED. This change indicates the formation of a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K. Additionally, the analysis of the UP spectra showed that the d band and the Fermi edge have some interesting changes during the growth process. The UPS results also suggested that Ag and Pt atoms mix on the top layer to form a 2D surface alloy at the specified temperature and coverage range.

对Ag薄膜在Pt(111)表面上的退火效果的表征使用了低能电子衍射（LEED）、俄歇电子谱和紫外光电子谱（UPS）。这些技术表明，在550至650 K的亚单层范围内，表面结构发生了变化，这从LEED发散束的强度异常变化中得到证据。这种变化表明，在600至700 K的温度范围内形成了一个无序的二维（2D）AgPt合金。此外，UP谱的分析显示，在生长过程中，d带和费米边缘有一些有趣的变化。UPS的结果还表明，Ag和Pt原子在顶层混合形成一个2D表面合金，处于指定的温度和覆盖范围。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) are employed to study the effects of annealing on the silver ultrathin film on a Pt(111) surface. These methods reveal that a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K. The analysis of the d band and the Fermi edge changes in the UPS spectra further supports the formation of a 2D surface alloy at these conditions.
