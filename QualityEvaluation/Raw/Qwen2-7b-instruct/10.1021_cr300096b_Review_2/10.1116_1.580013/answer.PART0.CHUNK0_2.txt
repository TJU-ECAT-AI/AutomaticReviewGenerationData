[1] "Lowenergy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were used to study the annealing effect of the silver ultrathin film on a Pt(111) surface."
[2] "The intensities of the specular beam of LEED versus temperature have abnormal change between 550 and 650 K in a submonolayer range."
[3] "The irreversibility of this IT curve gives evidence of a structure change of the surface."
[4] "The intensity of the specular beam of LEED varying with annealing time plus the Auger signals of Ag and Pt function of temperatures show that a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K."
[5] "UP spectra in the growth process show that the d band and the Fermi edge have some interesting changes."
[6] "On the other hand, UPS in the annealing process also strongly suggests that Ag and Pt atoms mix on the top layer to form a 2D surface alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K and a coverage in the submonolayer range."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) are employed to study the effects of annealing on the silver ultrathin film on a Pt(111) surface. These methods reveal that a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K. The analysis of the d band and the Fermi edge changes in the UPS spectra further supports the formation of a 2D surface alloy at these conditions.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。采用低能电子衍射（LEED）、俄歇电子能谱和紫外光电子能谱（UPS）等技术研究了银超薄薄膜在Pt(111)表面的退火效应。这些方法表明，在600至700 K之间的温度范围内，形成了一个亚单层范围内的无序二维AgPt合金。UPS谱图中d带和费米边缘的变化进一步证实了在这些条件下形成二维表面合金的情况。
