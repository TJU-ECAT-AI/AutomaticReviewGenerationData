[1] "The intensities of the specular beam of LEED versus temperature have abnormal change between 550 and 650 K in a submonolayer range."
[2] "The intensity of the specular beam of LEED varying with annealing time plus the Auger signals of Ag and Pt function of temperatures show that a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K."
[3] "UP spectra in the growth process show that the d band and the Fermi edge have some interesting changes."
[4] "On the other hand, UPS in the annealing process also strongly suggests that Ag and Pt atoms mix on the top layer to form a 2D surface alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K and a coverage in the submonolayer range."

The characterization of Ag films on Pt(111) surfaces was conducted using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The process is crucial for understanding the structural changes and the formation of a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K during annealing. The changes observed in the d band and the Fermi edge of the UPS spectra further suggest the mixing of Ag and Pt atoms on the top layer, forming a 2D surface alloy.

对Ag薄膜在Pt(111)表面的表征使用了低能电子衍射（LEED）、俄歇电子能谱和紫外光电子能谱（UPS）进行。这一过程对于理解在600至700 K温度范围内退火时表面结构的变化以及形成二维（2D）AgPt合金至关重要。UPS谱中d带和费米边界的有趣变化进一步表明，Ag和Pt原子在顶层混合形成一个2D表面合金。
