[1] "Lowenergy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) were used to study the annealing effect of the silver ultrathin film on a Pt(111) surface."
[2] "The intensities of the specular beam of LEED versus temperature have abnormal change between 550 and 650 K in a submonolayer range."
[3] "The intensity of the specular beam of LEED varying with annealing time plus the Auger signals of Ag and Pt function of temperatures show that a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy is formed in the submonolayer range at a temperature between 600 and 700 K."
[4] "UP spectra in the growth process show that the d band and the Fermi edge have some interesting changes."
[5] "On the other hand, UPS in the annealing process also strongly suggests that Ag and Pt atoms mix on the top layer to form a 2D surface alloy at a temperature between 600 and 700 K and a coverage in the submonolayer range."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The use of techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) allows researchers to analyze the surface structure and composition changes during annealing. The analysis of LEED patterns, Auger signals, and UPS spectra provides insights into the formation of a disordered two-dimensional (2D) AgPt alloy at specific temperatures, which contributes to the comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surfaces' properties in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
