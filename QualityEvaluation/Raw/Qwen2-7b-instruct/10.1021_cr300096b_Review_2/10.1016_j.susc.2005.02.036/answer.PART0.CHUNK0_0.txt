3.1. LEED
Upon annealing slowly to 600 C of a sample having an effective Tm coverage of one to two monolayers, a diffuse (2 × 2) LEED pattern started forming around 550 C. The LEED spots appeared at the sharpest around 600700 C, Fig. 1 a. This pattern was stable to approximately 750 C. 

3.2. Photoemission
The attenuation of the intensity of the Pt 4f core levels was used to estimate the amount of deposited Tm. The core level intensities Tm 4d, Tm 5p, Pt 4f and the intensity of the two strongest Tm 4f multiplets were monitored during the annealing of the sample and used as indicators for alloying. 

3.2.2. XPSvalence band
Fig. 3 shows the valence band spectra recorded at room temperature after deposition of a Tm layer of estimated effective thickness of 2.3 ML. The bottom curve in Fig. 3 shows as a reference the XPS (Al Kα) valence band spectrum of clean Pt(1 1 1). 

3.2.3. Core level shifts
The Tm 4d core level has a multiplet structure due to 4f4d interactions [19] ,[20] . The variation of the Tm 4d core levels as a function of annealing temperature of the 2.3 ML thick Tm/Pt(1 1 1) layer, is shown in Fig. 5 .

3.3. CO adsorption
The adsorption/desorption properties of the surface alloy with respect to CO were monitored by temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and also by recording the C 1s core level intensity as function of temperature.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to study the unique properties that emerge from the interaction between the two metals. The deposition process provides a controlled environment to analyze how the structure and electronic configuration of the surface evolve, which is essential for predicting and optimizing the catalytic activity and stability of these materials.
