The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The (2 × 2) LEED pattern forms upon heating the sample to 600°C for deposition of more than a monolayer of Tm, indicating alloy formation. The Tm 5p and 4f core levels show shifts of 0.8 eV to lower binding energies upon alloying, while the major Tm 4d multiplet shows a 1.1 eV shift to lower binding energy. These shifts are indicative of changes in coordination due to the formation of TmPt alloys. The formation of the latter alloy, accompanied by a 0.9 eV shift towards higher binding energies, suggests a different coordination environment.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及深入了解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。当沉积超过一层Tm时，加热样品至600°C后形成（2×2）LEED模式，表明合金形成。Tm 5p和4f核心能级在合金化过程中向较低结合能方向移动0.8eV，而主要的Tm 4d多重态则向较低结合能方向移动1.1eV。这些变化被认为是由于TmPt合金的形成导致的。后者合金的形成伴随着0.9eV的结合能向更高值的移动，这表明了不同的配位环境。
