[1] "The photoemission measurements were performed in the home laboratory using a hemispherical SES 2002 electron energy analyser (Gammadata Scienta)."
[2] "The Pt(1 1 1) crystal was resistively heated and cooled by liquid nitrogen down to about 190 C."
[3] "For Tm overlayer thicknesses of more than about one ML, ordered alloys exhibiting (2 × 2) LEED patterns were observed to form at 600 C."
[4] "The formation of the alloy is accompanied by shifts in the range 0.81.1 eV to lower binding energies of the Tm 4d, 5p and 4f12 core levels and multiplet lines."
[5] "The CO desorption from the alloy exhibiting the (2 × 2) LEED pattern occurs in the same temperature range as for CO on clean Pt(1 1 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
