3.1. LEED
Upon annealing slowly to 600 C of a sample having an effective Tm coverage of one to two monolayers, a diffuse (2 × 2) LEED pattern started forming around 550 C. The LEED spots appeared at the sharpest around 600700 C, Fig. 1 a. This pattern was stable to approximately 750 C. 

3.2. Photoemission
The attenuation of the intensity of the Pt 4f core levels was used to estimate the amount of deposited Tm. The core level intensities Tm 4d, Tm 5p, Pt 4f and the intensity of the two strongest Tm 4f multiplets were monitored during the annealing of the sample and used as indicators for alloying. 

3.2.2. XPSvalence band
Fig. 3 shows the valence band spectra recorded at room temperature after deposition of a Tm layer of estimated effective thickness of 2.3 ML. The bottom curve in Fig. 3 shows as a reference the XPS (Al Kα) valence band spectrum of clean Pt(1 1 1). 

3.2.3. Core level shifts
The Tm 4d core level has a multiplet structure due to 4f4d interactions [19] ,[20] . The variation of the Tm 4d core levels as a function of annealing temperature of the 2.3 ML thick Tm/Pt(1 1 1) layer, is shown in Fig. 5 .

3.3. CO adsorption
The adsorption/desorption properties of the surface alloy with respect to CO were monitored by temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and also by recording the C 1s core level intensity as function of temperature.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to study the unique properties that emerge from the interaction between the two metals. The deposition process provides a controlled environment to analyze how the structure and electronic configuration of the surface evolve, which is essential for predicting and optimizing the catalytic activity and stability of these materials.

3.1. LEED
Relatively diffuse LEED patterns were observed for Tm on Pt(1 1 1). Upon annealing slowly to 600 C of a sample having an effective Tm coverage of one to two monolayers, a diffuse (2 × 2) LEED pattern started forming around 550 C. The LEED spots appeared at the sharpest around 600700 C, Fig. 1 a. This pattern was stable to approximately 750 C. The photoemission results (see below), indicated a Pt enriched surface. As the sample was heated to 800 C, a more diffuse pattern consisting of multiple spots around the (1 × 1) reflexes appeared, Fig. 1 b. This structure will be denoted (1 × 1)+ in this paper. The latter LEED pattern did not form until the sample was heated to 900 C when more than about two monolayers (ML) Tm were deposited. The photoemission results (see below), indicated a considerable loss of the Tm 4d intensity, and the (1 × 1)+ LEED pattern was assigned to a submonolayer (thin) alloy, forming upon annealing to 900 C.

3.2. Photoemission
The attenuation of the intensity of the Pt 4f core levels was used to estimate the amount of deposited Tm. The core level intensities Tm 4d, Tm 5p, Pt 4f and the intensity of the two strongest Tm 4f multiplets were monitored during the annealing of the sample and used as indicators for alloying. The Pt 4f core levels showed small shifts from the clean sample of about 0.2 eV to lower binding energy after deposition of Tm, but no substantial shifts where observed after annealing. The Tm 4d, 5p and 4f levels all showed large shifts to lower binding energies of about 1.1, 0.8 and 0.8 eV; respectively, upon annealing to 600 C. In addition, UPS using He-I and He-II radiation was used to monitor the valence band. Finally, the work function was recorded during alloy formation. In the following section we will describe in more detail some of the experimental observations.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The LEED technique provides insights into the surface structure, revealing that for Tm on Pt(1 1 1), a (2 × 2) LEED pattern forms upon annealing to 600 C, indicating alloy formation. This pattern stabilizes up to 750 C, followed by the formation of a (1 × 1)+ LEED pattern at 800 C, suggesting a thin alloy is formed. The core level shifts observed for Tm indicate changes in coordination within the alloy.
