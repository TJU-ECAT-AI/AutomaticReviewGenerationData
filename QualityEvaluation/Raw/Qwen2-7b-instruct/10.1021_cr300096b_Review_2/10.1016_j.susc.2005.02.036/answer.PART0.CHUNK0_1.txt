[1] "The CO desorption from the alloy exhibiting the (2 × 2) LEED pattern occurs in the same temperature range as for CO on clean Pt(1 1 1)."
[2] "However, the desorption temperature for CO on the alloy exhibiting the modified (1 × 1) LEED pattern, was lowered by 80100 K compared to CO on clean Pt(1 1 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
