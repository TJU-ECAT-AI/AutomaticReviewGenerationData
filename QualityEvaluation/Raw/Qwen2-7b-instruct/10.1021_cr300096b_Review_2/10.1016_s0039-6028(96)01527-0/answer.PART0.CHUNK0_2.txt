[1] "Alloy and bimetallic surfaces have become an area of much current research [l] because of their fundamental interests and also their importance in novel device fabrication for various technological applications,for examples in catalysis, coatings,and magnetic recording [2,3]."
[2] "The experiments were carried out using synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring, Orsay, France."
[3] "To study the Pt 4f,,, photoemission line (bulk binding energy (BE) 7 1.15 eV), the photon energy was set to 150 eV using p-polarisation."
[4] "Up to 2 ML we found the same pair of peaks,i.e. a bulk-like peak (labelled B*) at 71.0f0.03 eV,and a surface-like peak (labelled S*) at 70.6 +0.03 eV."
[5] "The same behaviour of the intensity curve has also been observed for both bulk and total emission."
[6] "We can distinguish two separate stages in the growth process. (1) Up to 2 ML, we have evidence for the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy at room temperature."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the detailed examination and prediction of surface interactions and reactivity, which are essential for optimizing catalyst performance and developing new materials.

3. The growth of the Pt layer up to 2 ML shows the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy. This is evidenced by the presence of a bulk-like peak (B*) at 71.0f0.03 eV and a surface-like peak (S*) at 70.6 +0.03 eV. The behavior of the intensity curve for both bulk and total emissions indicates a similar trend, suggesting a coherent and stable alloy formation process.
