The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The characterization includes studying the Pt 4f core-level spectra using synchrotron radiation at a photon energy of 150 eV with p-polarization. The evolution of the Pt 4f core-level spectra shows distinct peaks that indicate the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy. The intensity of the surface peak increases linearly up to 1 ML deposition, and then the pattern evolves into a diffuse c(2 x 2) pattern for higher coverages. Annealing affects the dissolution kinetics, with the intensity of the surface and bulk peaks decreasing and shifting towards lower binding energy, indicating the blocking of the dissolution process.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行全面理解至关重要。表征包括使用同步辐射在150 eV的光子能量下进行Pt 4f核心级光谱研究，使用pp偏振。Pt 4f核心级光谱的演化显示了表明形成扩展的Pt-Cu表面合金的特征峰。表面峰的强度在1 ML沉积量内线性增加，然后在更高的覆盖度下演变为扩散的c(2 x 2)模式。退火影响溶解动力学，表面和基体峰的强度降低并朝更低的结合能位移，表明溶解动力学被阻塞。
