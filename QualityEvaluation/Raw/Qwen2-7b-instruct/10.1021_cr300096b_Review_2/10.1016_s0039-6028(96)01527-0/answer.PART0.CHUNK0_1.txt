The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of synchrotron-radiation induced core-level photoemission spectroscopy (PES) enables the detailed examination of the growth dynamics and composition changes during the formation of the Pt/Cu surface alloy. The method allows for the estimation of the Pt concentration in the surface layer, providing insights into the surface composition and behavior under various conditions, such as annealing. The linear increase in the intensity up to 1 ML deposition suggests a stable and continuous formation of the surface alloy. However, beyond this coverage, the alloy structure is disrupted, leading to the growth of a pure and disordered Pt thin film. This research provides a fundamental understanding of the kinetic processes involved in the growth of bimetallic surfaces and their potential applications in catalysis and materials science.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。使用同步辐射诱导核心能级光电发射光谱（PES）能够详细地检查生长动态和组成变化，以形成Pt/Cu表面合金。这种方法允许估计表面层中Pt的浓度，提供了关于表面组成和在各种条件下行为的见解，例如退火。强度线性增加直到1ML沉积表明表面合金稳定且连续形成。然而，在此覆盖范围之外，合金结构被破坏，导致纯而无序的Pt薄片开始生长。这项研究为生长双金属表面的动态过程提供了一种基本的理解，并可能应用于催化和材料科学。
