[1] "Alloy and bimetallic surfaces have become an area of much current research [l] because of their fundamental interests and also their importance in novel device fabrication for various technological applications,for examples in catalysis, coatings,and magnetic recording [2,3]."

[4] "The base pressure during analysis was 8 x lo-l1 Torr."
[5] "Clean Cu( 100) single-crystal surfaces were obtained by repeated cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV,8 ,uA cm-)."
[6] "The Pt deposition rate was obtained in two ways:first by using a quartz balance monitor, and second by comparing the intensities of the Pt and Cu Auger transitions with previous results from Graham et al. [12]."
[7] "To study the Pt 4f,,, photoemission line (bulk binding energy (BE) 7 1.15 eV), the photon energy was set to 150 eV using p-polarisation."
[8] "Fig. la shows a typical Pt 4f,,, core-level spectrum."
[9] "Looking more closely at the evolution of the individual peak positions, we observe that even at the lowest coverage, two contributions are apparent in the Pt 4f,,, core level."
[10] "Up to 1 ML, we observe a linear increase in the intensity. There then follows a flatter region between 1 and 2 ML where the surface peak intensity evolves slowly."
[11] "For higher coverage, the peaks S* and B* disappear and we obtain a new surface peak S at 70.75 5 0.03 eV."
[12] "LEED patterns were monitored periodically during Pt deposition."
[13] "The patterns were found to evolve from a sharp p(1 x 1) with low-intensity background to a diffuse p( 1 x 1) with high-intensity background for 3 ML deposition."
[14] "We also studied the thermal behaviour of Pt/Cu(lOO) thin films."
[15] "Figs. 2a and 2b show a lineshape analysis of the Pt 4f,,, spectrum before and after annealing for 30 min at 300C for an initial Pt deposition of 3 ML."
[16] "The effects of annealing are two-fold: first, the inten- sities of B and S decrease, indicating that Pt diffuses into the Cu substrate, and second, the B and S peaks shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively."
[17] "After annealing, the LEED patterns became sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities."
[18] "It is clear from Figs. 2a and 3 that the growth of Pt/Cu(lOO) differs from the layer-by-layer growth model [ 171."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The study employs synchrotron radiation for experiments, maintaining a base pressure of 8 x lo-l1 Torr during analysis. Clean Cu( 100) single-crystal surfaces are obtained through repeated cycles of argon-ion sputtering. The Pt deposition rate is determined using a quartz balance monitor or by comparing the intensities of Pt and Cu Auger transitions. The Pt 4f,,, core-level spectrum is studied using a photon energy of 150 eV with p-polarization. The growth process is characterized by two stages: up to 2 ML, an extended Ni/Pt surface alloy forms, and beyond this coverage, the alloy is destroyed, leading to the growth of a pure and disordered Ni thin film. Thermal behavior is also studied, showing that annealing affects the Pt concentration in the substrate and shifts the Pt 4f,,, peaks towards lower binding energy. After annealing, the LEED patterns transform into sharp c(2 x 2) spots, indicating the formation of an extended Ni/Pt surface alloy.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt（111）或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。研究使用同步辐射进行实验，分析过程中保持压力为8 x lo-l1 Torr。通过重复氩离子溅射获得清洁的Cu（100）单晶表面。通过比较Pt和Cu Auger过渡的强度来确定Pt沉积速率。使用150 eV的光子能量和pp偏振研究了Pt 4f,,,核心级谱。生长过程分为两个阶段：在2 ML之前，形成扩展的Ni/Pt表面合金；超过此覆盖度，合金被破坏，导致纯而无序的Ni薄片生长。还研究了热行为，显示退火影响了基体中的Pt浓度，并使Pt 4f,,,峰向较低的结合能移动。退火后，LEED图案转变为尖锐的c(2 x 2)斑点，表明形成了扩展的Ni/Pt表面合金。
