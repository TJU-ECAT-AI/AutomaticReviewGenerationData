          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It utilizes synchrotron radiation, specifically the SA73b beamline with a TGM7 monochromator, for experiments conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with a hemispherical analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are obtained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV, 8 μA cm−) followed by annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The growth process up to 2 ML reveals the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy, characterized by a bulk-like peak (B*) at 71.0 ± 0.03 eV and a surface-like peak (S*) at 70.6 ± 0.03 eV. The relative variation of the intensity is +10%. Annealing affects the alloy structure, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. After annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 × 2) with low background intensities.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。它利用同步辐射，特别是SA73b光束线配以TGM7色散器，进行实验，这些实验在不锈钢超真空(UHV)室中进行，该室配备有用于光电发射光谱(PES)的半球形分析仪、用于AES的圆柱镜分析仪和LEED装置。通过氩离子溅射(600 eV, 8 μA cm−)和850 K的退火制备得到干净的Cu(100)单晶表面。使用150 eV的p方向极化的光子研究具有7 1.15 eV本征能级的Pt 4f核心级光电发射线。在2 ML之前，识别出了形成扩展的Pt-Cu表面合金的过程，其特征是具有71.0 ± 0.03 eV的类似晶粒内部的峰值（B*）和具有70.6 ± 0.03 eV的类似表面的峰值（S*）。相对强度的变化为+10%。退火影响合金结构，导致B和S的强度降低，并使峰值分别向更低的结合能移动150 meV到达B*和S*位置。退火后，LEED图案转变为清晰的c(2 × 2)，背景强度低。

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It includes studying the Pt-Cu system as part of a broader research project on thin films and surface alloys. Experiments utilize synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring in Orsay, France, with a base pressure of 8 x 10^-11 Torr during analysis. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are prepared through cycles of argon-ion sputtering at 600 eV, 8 μA cm-. The Pt deposition rate is determined using either a quartz balance monitor or by comparing the intensities of the Pt and Cu Auger transitions with previous findings by Graham et al. [12]. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is examined with 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The Pt 4f core-level spectrum is shown in Fig. la. Even at the lowest coverage, two contributions are evident in the Pt 4f core level. Up to 1 ML, there is a linear increase in the intensity. Between 1 and 2 ML, the surface peak intensity evolves slowly. For higher coverage, the peaks S* and B* vanish, and a new surface peak S at 70.75 ± 0.03 eV is observed. LEED patterns are monitored during Pt deposition, evolving from a sharp p(1 x 1) with low-intensity background to a diffuse p(1 x 1) with high-intensity background for 3 ML deposition. The thermal behavior of Pt/Cu(100) thin films is also investigated. After annealing at 300°C for 30 min with an initial Pt deposition of 3 ML, the Pt 4f core-level spectrum is analyzed before and after annealing (Fig. 2a and 2b). Annealing affects the Pt concentration in the substrate, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the B and S peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. Following annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities. The growth of Pt/Cu(100) is observed to differ from the layer-by-layer growth model.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下。作为薄层和表面合金研究的更广泛研究项目的一部分，研究了Pt-Cu系统。实验利用了位于法国奥赛的SuperAco存储环上的同步辐射，分析期间的压力为8 x 10^-11托。通过600 eV，8 μA cm-的氩离子溅射制备得到干净的Cu(100)单晶表面。通过比较Graham等人的先前发现来确定Pt沉积速率，使用的是石英平衡监测器或Pt和Cu Auger过渡的强度。具有7 1.15 eV本征能级的Pt 4f核心级光电发射线使用150 eV的p方向极化的光子进行研究。在Fig. la中展示了Pt 4f核心级谱图。即使在最低覆盖度下，Pt 4f核心级中也存在两个贡献。在1 ML之前，强度线性增加。在1和2 ML之间，表面峰值强度缓慢演变。对于更高的覆盖度，消失的峰值S*和B*，观察到一个新的表面峰值S在70.75 ± 0.03 eV。在Pt沉积期间监控LEED图案，从具有低强度背景的尖锐p(1 x 1)演变到具有高强度背景的模糊p(1 x 1)。对于3 ML沉积，初始Pt沉积为3 ML。进行了Pt/Cu(100)薄片的热行为研究。在300°C下进行30 min的退火后，分析了Pt 4f核心级谱图（Fig. 2a和2b）。退火影响了基体中的Pt浓度，导致B和S的强度降低，并使B和S峰值分别向更低的结合能移动150 meV到达B*和S*位置。退火后，LEED图案成为清晰的c(2 × 2)，背景强度低。观察到Pt/Cu(100)的生长与分层生长模型不同。
