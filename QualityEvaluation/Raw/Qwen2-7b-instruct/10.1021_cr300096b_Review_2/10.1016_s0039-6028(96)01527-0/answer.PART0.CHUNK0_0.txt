1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted using synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring in Orsay, France. The beamline utilized was SA73b with a TGM7 monochromator. The experiments were executed in a stainless-steel UHV chamber, featuring a hemispherical analyzer for PES, a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for AES, and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces were attained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering and annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f,,, core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, was studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. For the growth of Pt/Cu(100), a two-stage process was identified, up to 2 ML, evidence for the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy. Annealing at 300°C led to the dissolution of the surface alloy, with Pt diffusing into the Cu substrate, causing the B and S peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy and the LEED patterns to become sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities.

1. 尼/铂双金属表面的表征在法国奥赛的超级阿科存储环上使用同步辐射进行。使用的光束线是SA73b，配备有TGM7色散器。实验在不锈钢UHV室中进行，该室配备了用于PES的半球形分析仪、用于AES的圆柱镜分析仪和LEED装置。通过氩离子溅射和850K的退火制备了干净的Cu(100)单晶表面。使用150eV的p极化光子研究了具有7 1.15 eV本征能级的Pt 4f,,,核心级光发射线。对于Pt/Cu(100)的生长，识别出了两个阶段过程，在2 ML之前，形成了扩展的Pt-Cu表面合金。在300°C下退火导致表面合金溶解，铂扩散到Cu基体中，使B和S峰向更低的结合能移动150meV，并且LEED图案变为清晰的c(2 x 2)，背景强度低。
