1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted using synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring in Orsay, France. The beamline utilized was SA73b with a TGM7 monochromator. The experiments were executed in a stainless-steel UHV chamber, featuring a hemispherical analyzer for PES, a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for AES, and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces were attained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering and annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f,,, core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, was studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. For the growth of Pt/Cu(100), a two-stage process was identified, up to 2 ML, evidence for the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy. Annealing at 300°C led to the dissolution of the surface alloy, with Pt diffusing into the Cu substrate, causing the B and S peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy and the LEED patterns to become sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of synchrotron-radiation induced core-level photoemission spectroscopy (PES) enables the detailed examination of the growth dynamics and composition changes during the formation of the Pt/Cu surface alloy. The method allows for the estimation of the Pt concentration in the surface layer, providing insights into the surface composition and behavior under various conditions, such as annealing. The linear increase in the intensity up to 1 ML deposition suggests a stable and continuous formation of the surface alloy. However, beyond this coverage, the alloy structure is disrupted, leading to the growth of a pure and disordered Pt thin film. This research provides a fundamental understanding of the kinetic processes involved in the growth of bimetallic surfaces and their potential applications in catalysis and materials science.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The characterization includes studying the Pt 4f core-level spectra using synchrotron radiation at a photon energy of 150 eV with p-polarization. The evolution of the Pt 4f core-level spectra shows distinct peaks that indicate the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy. The intensity of the surface peak increases linearly up to 1 ML deposition, and then the pattern evolves into a diffuse c(2 x 2) pattern for higher coverages. Annealing affects the dissolution kinetics, with the intensity of the surface and bulk peaks decreasing and shifting towards lower binding energy, indicating the blocking of the dissolution process.
