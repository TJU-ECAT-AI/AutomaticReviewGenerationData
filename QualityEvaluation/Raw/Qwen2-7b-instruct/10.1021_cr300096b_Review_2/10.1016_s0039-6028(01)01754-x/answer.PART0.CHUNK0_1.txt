[1] "The structure observed upon annealing a Pt(1 1 1) sample with a 2 ML (monolayer, ML) thick film of Co does not consist of a rotated Co film but rather of a CoPt alloy film with hexagonal areas of fcc stacking, single and double stacking faults, delimited by misfit dislocations (Shockley partial dislocations)."
[2] "Comparison of STM images with embedded atom method calculations confirms our model."
[3] "The reason for the observation of rotated LEED satellite spots in Ref. [6] is argued to be due to the observation of the second order diffraction spots rather than the first order satellite diffraction spots."
[4] "The unrotated unit cell was not observed in LEED due to the large size of the real (unrotated) unit cell means that its satellite spots are very close to the integer spots and thus easily lost in the glare of the integer spots."
[5] "A close-up of the surface is shown in the STM image with atomic resolution in Fig. 3 a."
[6] "The simulation confirms all details, such as the bright and broad ridges around the double stacking-fault domains, whereas the ridges between the fcc and single stacking-fault domains appear darker and almost completely disappear in some places."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. By analyzing the structure of the deposited Ni layer on Pt, scientists can predict how the metals interact, how they might form alloys, and how their combined properties can be utilized in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
