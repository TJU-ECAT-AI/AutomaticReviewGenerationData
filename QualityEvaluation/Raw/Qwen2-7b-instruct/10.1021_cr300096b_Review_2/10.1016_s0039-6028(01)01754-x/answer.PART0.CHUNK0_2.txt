[1] "Because of their suitability as magnetic or magneto-optical data storage medium, the magnetic and structural properties of CoPt thin films and multilayer systems have been investigated in detail in the recent past [1] ,[2] ,[3] ,[4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] ,[8] ."
[2] "In this paper, we report on investigations of a 2 ML Co film on Pt(111) annealed at 700 K by the use of STM and embedded atom method (EAM) calculations."
[3] "The reason for the observation of rotated LEED satellite spots in Ref. [6] is argued to be due to the observation of the second order diffraction spots rather than the first order satellite diffraction spots."
[4] "In the case of RT deposition of Co on Pt(111) dislocations in the first monolayer can glide at RT (Ref. [3], also note the frizzy appearance of some dislocations in Fig. 2b of Ref. [4])."
[5] "We have shown that the structure of a 2 ML thick Co film on Pt(111) deposited at RT and then annealed at 700 K does not consist of a rotated overlayer but rather of a misfit structure based on a model similar to that proposed by Henzler [7]."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By studying the structure of the deposited Ni monolayer, scientists can predict how the surface will behave under various conditions, which is essential for developing new catalysts and improving existing ones.
