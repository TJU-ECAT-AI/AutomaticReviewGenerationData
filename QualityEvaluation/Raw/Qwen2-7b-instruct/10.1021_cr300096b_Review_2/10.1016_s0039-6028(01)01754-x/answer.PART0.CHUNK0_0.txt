[1] "The structure observed upon annealing a Pt(1 1 1) sample with a 2 ML (monolayer, ML) thick film of Co does not consist of a rotated Co film but rather of a CoPt alloy film with hexagonal areas of fcc stacking, single and double stacking faults, delimited by misfit dislocations (Shockley partial dislocations)."
[2] "Comparison of STM images with embedded atom method calculations confirms our model."
[3] "The reason for the observation of rotated LEED satellite spots in Ref. [6] is argued to be due to the observation of the second order diffraction spots rather than the first order satellite diffraction spots."
[4] "In reciprocal space the rotated cell is actually formed by second order diffraction spots of the unrotated cell."
[5] "The structure, which accommodates the 5% misfit of the PtCo alloy film with respect to the Pt(1 1 1) substrate, is characterised by hexagonal domains of fcc stacking, single and double stacking faults, separated by Shockley partial dislocations."

This study found that the Co film on Pt(1 1 1) substrate, after annealing, did not form a rotated Co film as previously thought. Instead, it created a CoPt alloy film with hexagonal regions of fcc stacking, single and double stacking faults, bounded by misfit dislocations. This structure, confirmed by both STM imaging and EAM calculations, demonstrates how the 5% misfit between the CoPt alloy and the Pt(1 1 1) substrate is accommodated. The observed rotated LEED satellite spots in the literature were explained as being due to second-order diffraction rather than a rotated surface layer. The presence of these dislocations and stacking faults, which are key components of the model, supports the understanding of the structure's stability and the mechanism of misfit accommodation in such bimetallic systems.

本研究发现，在退火后，Co薄膜在Pt(1 1 1)基底上并未形成旋转的Co薄膜，而是形成了一个CoPt合金薄膜，其中包含具有fcc堆积、单和双堆叠故障的六边形区域，并由错配位错分隔。这种结构通过STM成像和EAM模拟的对比确认了模型的正确性，表明了5%的错配如何在CoPt合金和Pt(1 1 1)基底之间得到缓解。观察到的旋转LEED卫星斑点被解释为第二级衍射而非表面层的旋转。这些位错和堆叠故障的存在，是该模型的关键组成部分，支持了对这类双金属体系中结构稳定性和错配缓解机制的理解。
