The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is conducted under ultra-high vacuum conditions with base pressures below 5×1011 mbar. STM measurements are carried out in constant current mode with the sample held negatively. Prior to deposition, the Pt(1 1 1) substrate is prepared in a separate chamber with a base pressure of approximately 1010 mbar. The cleanliness of the substrate and the deposited Co surfaces is confirmed through Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) using a cylindrical mirror analyser. Nickel is deposited using a water-cooled electron beam evaporator with a typical evaporation rate of 0.5 ML/min, as measured by a quartz crystal microbalance. The accuracy of the Co coverage is estimated to be less than 10% based on the ratio between the Co 773 eV and the Pt 237 eV Auger peak-to-peak signals.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。该过程在低于5×1011 mbar的基压下在超高真空条件下进行。通过常电流模式的STM测量，样品保持为负电荷状态。在沉积前，以大约1010 mbar的压力在单独的腔室中制备了Pt（1 1 1）基底。通过使用柱状镜分析器的AES确认了基底和沉积的Co表面的清洁度。镍通过水冷电子束蒸发器沉积，典型的蒸发率为每分钟0.5 ML/min，通过石英晶体微平衡测量。根据Co 773 eV和Pt 237 eV的Auger峰峰值信号之间的比率，估计Co覆盖的准确性小于10%。
