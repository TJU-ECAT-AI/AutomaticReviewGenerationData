1. The STM measurements were carried out in a UHV chamber with a base pressure below 5×1011 mbar. All STM images were acquired in constant current mode with the sample in a negative state.
2. The comparison between STM images and EAM simulations validates our model.
3. The cause of the observed rotation of LEED satellite spots in Ref. [6] is stated to be the observation of second-order diffraction spots instead of the primary satellite diffraction spots.
4. The structure of a 2 ML thick Co film on Pt(1 1 1) deposited at RT and then annealed at 700 K is not a rotated Co film but rather a CoPt alloy film with hexagonal areas of fcc stacking, single and double stacking faults, delimited by misfit dislocations.
5. The reason for the rotation of LEED satellite spots observed in Ref. [6] is attributed to the observation of second-order diffraction spots rather than the primary satellite diffraction spots.
6. The structure discussed in this paper appears only after annealing at 700 K, despite the double stacking fault's energetic advantage over the on-top sites of the moir structure.

1. STM测量在压力低于5×1011 mbar的UHV室中进行。所有STM图像均在样品负极模式下以恒定电流模式获得。
2. STM图像与EAM模拟之间的比较证实了我们的模型。
3. 在Ref.[6]中观察到旋转LEED卫星斑点的原因是观察到了第二级衍射斑点，而不是主要的卫星衍射斑点。
4. 2 ML厚的Co薄膜在Pt(1 1 1)表面上沉积并在700 K下退火后，其结构不是旋转的Co薄膜，而是由fcc堆叠、单和双堆叠缺陷形成的CoPt合金薄膜，这些缺陷由错配位错（Shockley部分位错）界定。
5. 在Ref.[6]中观察到旋转LEED卫星斑点的原因是观察到了第二级衍射斑点，而不是主要的卫星衍射斑点。
6. 虽然双堆叠缺陷在能量上有优势，但讨论的结构仅在700 K下退火后出现，而非在原位结构中。
