[1] "In the present study we use the adsorption/de- sorption of Xe and CO as a sensitive probe for the determination of the surface composition of Pt/Cu surface alloys."
[2] "Xe adsorption on the surface alloys reflects the average Pt composition in the first Cu layer and correspondingly the desorption energy shifts linearly with the Pt concentration."
[3] "CO adsorbs first on Pt positions [17,18] and consequently due to the repulsive CO-CO interaction all surrounding Cu-Pt sites are blocked by the COpt molecules."
[4] "The CO TD spectra of the Pt/Cu surface alloys show a higher number of mixed Cu-Pt sites between 25 and 75% Pt concentration."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The adsorption and desorption of gases like xenon (Xe) and carbon monoxide (CO) serve as sensitive probes for determining the surface composition of Pt/Cu alloys. The shifts in the desorption energies of Xe reflect the average Pt concentration in the Cu layer. CO tends to adsorb first on Pt sites, blocking the surrounding Cu-Pt sites due to repulsive interactions between CO molecules. At higher Pt concentrations, the number of mixed Cu-Pt sites increases, indicating a higher degree of Pt dispersion within the Cu matrix.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单分子层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。气体如氙（Xe）和一氧化碳（CO）的吸附和脱附用作确定Pt/Cu合金表面组成敏感探针。Xe的脱附能的偏移反映了Cu层中Pt浓度的平均值。CO倾向于首先吸附在Pt位点上，由于CO分子之间的排斥作用阻塞了周围的Cu-Pt位点。在较高的Pt浓度下，混合Cu-Pt位点的数量增加，表明Pt在Cu矩阵中的分散程度更高。
