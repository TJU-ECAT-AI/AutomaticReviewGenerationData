The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The adsorption and desorption of xenon (Xe) and carbon monoxide (CO) serve as sensitive probes for determining the surface composition of Pt/Cu surface alloys. The interaction between Xe and CO with the Pt surface is stronger than with the Cu surface. CO molecules preferentially adsorb on Pt positions before occupying mixed Cu-Pt and Cu sites. The CO adsorption on bridge sites at low Pt concentrations is reduced due to the dispersion of Pt atoms in the Cu matrix. At higher Pt concentrations, a high number of Pt-Cu mixed sites are found compared to deposited Pt films on Cu(111) surfaces. The adsorption energy of CO on Pt atoms embedded in the Cu matrix is reduced by up to 25% compared to pure Pt(111) surfaces.

对于Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来实现。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面了解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质至关重要。Xe和CO的吸附和脱附作为确定Pt/Cu表面合金表面组成的高度敏感探针。Xe和CO与Pt表面的相互作用强于Cu表面。CO分子优先吸附在Pt位置，然后占据混合Cu-Pt和Cu位点。在低Pt浓度下，CO在桥接位点的吸附量因Pt原子在Cu矩阵中的分散而减少。随着Pt浓度的增加，在Pt/Cu表面合金中发现的Pt-Cu混合位点数量比在Cu(111)表面上沉积的纯Pt薄膜要高。嵌入Cu矩阵中的Pt原子上的CO吸附能相比于纯Pt(111)表面降低高达25%。
