[1] "The aim of this work is to study the morphology and the changes in the adsorption behaviour with increasing Pt concentration in the topmost layer of the Cu-Pt surface alloys."
[2] "Xe adsorption on the surface alloys reflects the average Pt composition in the first Cu layer and correspondingly the desorption energy shifts linearly with the Pt concentration."
[3] "CO adsorbs first on Pt positions [17,18] and consequently due to the repulsive CO-CO interaction all surrounding Cu-Pt sites are blocked by the COpt molecules."
[4] "The CO TD spectra of the Pt/Cu surface alloys show a higher number of mixed Cu-Pt sites between 25 and 75% Pt concentration."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. Specifically, the adsorption behavior changes with increasing Pt concentration, reflecting the average Pt composition in the first Cu layer. CO tends to adsorb first on Pt positions, blocking the surrounding Cu-Pt sites due to the repulsive CO-CO interaction. The number of mixed Cu-Pt sites increases between 25 and 75% Pt concentration on the surface alloys.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。具体而言，随着Pt浓度的增加，吸附行为发生变化，反映了第一层Cu中的平均Pt组成。CO倾向于首先吸附在Pt位置上，由于CO-CO相互作用的排斥性，这会阻塞周围的Cu-Pt位点。在表面合金中，当Pt浓度在25%到75%之间时，混合的Cu-Pt位点的数量增加。
