[1] "The aim of this work is to study the morphology and the changes in the adsorption behaviour with increasing Pt concentration in the topmost layer of the Cu-Pt surface alloys."
[2] "As already shown in previous experiments [9], Xe TDS is a good probe to monitor the Pt-Cu surface composition."
[3] "Likewise the average desorption temperature for the Xe atoms is increased, compared to the annealed surface alloys."
[4] "Thermal CO desorption spectra obtained from Pt/Cu(111) surface alloys with different Pt concentrations after adsorption of different amounts of CO at 90 K are depicted in Fig. 2."
[5] "Three regions are known from CO TDS experiments on dispersed Pt-films on Cu(lll) [9]."
[6] "Remarkable is the intensity ratio of bridge (both ,--- 1850 cm -1 ) to ontop positions on Cu and Pt, respectively, which has a minimum at a Pt concentration of 20%."
[7] "The desorption must therefore originate from higher coordinated adsorption sites than ontop positions."
[8] "Fig. 4 finally shows the work function change measured during CO adsorption at 90 K on Pt/Cu surface alloys with different concentrations of Pt prepared by annealing 2 ML Pt/Cu(111) to increasing temperatures above 500 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through adsorption techniques such as CO and Xe adsorption/desorption. These methods serve as sensitive probes for determining the composition of the Ni/Pt surface alloys. The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Specifically, the changes in adsorption behavior with varying Pt concentration allow researchers to understand how the interaction with adsorbed species changes due to alloying, contributing significantly to the field of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

通过沉积Ni单层在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上，对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征。使用CO和Xe吸附/脱附等技术作为敏感探针来确定Ni/Pt表面合金的组成。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。具体而言，随着Pt浓度的变化，吸附行为的变化使研究人员能够了解由于合金化导致的与吸附物种交互作用的变化，这显著推动了表面科学和催化研究领域的发展。
