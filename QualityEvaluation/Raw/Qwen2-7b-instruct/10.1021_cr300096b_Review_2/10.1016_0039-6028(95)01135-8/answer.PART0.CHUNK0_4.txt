[1] "Above 500 K Pt atoms diffuse into the Cu bulk, thus, it is possible to produce different surface alloys by heating 2 ML Pt/Cu(lll) to increasing temperatures."
[2] "The topmost layer consists of dispersed Pt atoms in a Cu matrix and Xe adsorption/desorption can be used as a probe for the PtCu composition of the surface."
[3] "CO adsorbs first on Pt sites before populating mixed Cu-Pt and Cu positions."
[4] "The CO adsorption on bridge sites at small Pt concentrations is reduced because of the dispers distribution of the Pt atoms in the Cu matrix."
[5] "At higher Pt concentrations a high number of Pt-Cu mixed sites are found in contrast to deposited Pt films on the Cu(lll) surface."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The dispersion of Pt atoms in the Cu matrix affects the adsorption behavior of CO, leading to the formation of mixed Cu-Pt sites at different concentrations. This allows for the detailed study of the interactions between the metals and adsorbates, contributing to the development of catalysts with enhanced performance.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下。Pt原子在Cu矩阵中的分散性影响了CO的吸附行为，导致不同浓度下形成混合Cu-Pt位点。这使得对金属与吸附剂之间的相互作用进行详细研究成为可能，有助于开发性能更优的催化剂。
