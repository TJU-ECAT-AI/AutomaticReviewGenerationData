The Pt(111)Sn(2×2) and Pt(111)Sn(3×3)R30 surfaces have been prepared and characterised in UHV by vapour deposition of Sn on Pt(111) and the surfaces subsequently transferred for electrochemical investigation.
Evidence that it is associated with the adsorption of OH comes from ex situ photoemission measurements, which indicate that the Sn atoms are in a metallic state at potentials below 0.15 VRHE, and an oxidised state at potentials above 0.28RHE.
A second surface redox couple, associated with further oxidation of the Sn sites in the alloy surfaces, is observed at 0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE.
CO is adsorbed from solution at 300 K, with saturation coverages of 0.37 ± 0.05 ML and 0.2 ± 0.05 ML, respectively.
The adsorbed CO is oxidatively stripped at the potential coincident with the adsorption of hydroxide on the tin sites at the lower potential of 0.28 VRHE.
This redox behaviour at higher potentials is modified by the presence of CO in stripping experiments, with couples now observed at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE, and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE.

The characterization of the Pt(111)Sn(2×2) and Pt(111)Sn(3×3)R30 surfaces involved vapor deposition of tin onto a platinum single crystal, followed by transfer for electrochemical investigation. The surface redox behavior was linked to the adsorption and desorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites, which was confirmed by ex situ photoemission measurements showing the Sn atoms were metallic below 0.15 VRHE and oxidized above 0.28 VRHE. A second redox couple was observed at 0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE, related to further oxidation of the Sn sites. Carbon monoxide (CO) was adsorbed onto the surface at 300 K, with specific oxidation occurring at the potential coinciding with hydroxide adsorption on the Sn sites, specifically at 0.28 VRHE. At higher potentials, the presence of CO altered the redox behavior, resulting in observed couples at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE.

对Pt(111)Sn(2×2)和Pt(111)Sn(3×3)R30表面的表征涉及在单晶铂表面上通过气相沉积锡，然后转移进行电化学研究。表面的氧化还原行为与Sn位点上的羟基吸附和脱附相关联，这由离线光发射测量证实。Sn原子在低于0.15 VRHE时为金属状态，在高于0.28 VRHE时为氧化状态。观察到第二个氧化还原偶数在0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE处，与合金表面中Sn位点的进一步氧化有关。在300 K下，将CO吸附至表面，特定的氧化作用发生在与Sn位点上羟基吸附的电位相匹配的位置，具体为0.28 VRHE。在更高电位下，CO的存在改变了氧化还原行为，导致观测到的偶数为0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE和0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE。
