[1] "The Pt(111)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(111)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces have been prepared and characterised in UHV by vapour deposition of Sn on Pt(111) and the surfaces subsequently transferred for electrochemical investigation."
[2] "Evidence that it is associated with the adsorption of OH comes from ex situ photoemission measurements, which indicate that the Sn atoms are in a metallic state at potentials below 0.15 VRHE, and an oxidised state at potentials above 0.28RHE."
[3] "Specific adsorption of sulphate anions is not associated with the surface process since there is no evidence from photoemission of sulphate adsorption, and the same surface couple is observed in HClO4 electrolyte."
[4] "A second surface redox couple, associated with further oxidation of the Sn sites in the alloy surfaces, is observed at 0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE."
[5] "CO is adsorbed from solution at 300 K, with saturation coverages of 0.37 ± 0.05 ML and 0.2 ± 0.05 ML, respectively."
[6] "The adsorbed CO is oxidatively stripped at the potential coincident with the adsorption of hydroxide on the tin sites at the lower potential of 0.28 VRHE."
[7] "This redox behaviour at higher potentials is modified by the presence of CO in stripping experiments, with couples now observed at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE, and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves vapor deposition of Ni on the Pt surface followed by transfer for electrochemical investigation. This process is crucial because it allows for the detailed examination of the surface's redox behavior, stability, and electro-oxidation of CO, providing insights into the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
