The Pt(111)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(111)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces have been prepared and characterized in UHV by vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(111) and the surfaces subsequently transferred for electrochemical investigation.
Evidence that it is associated with the adsorption of OH comes from ex situ photoemission measurements, which indicate that the Sn atoms are in a metallic state at potentials below 0.15 VRHE, and an oxidized state at potentials above 0.28VRHE.
A second surface redox couple, associated with further oxidation of the Sn sites in the alloy surfaces, is observed at 0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE.
CO is adsorbed from solution at 300 K, with saturation coverages of 0.37 ± 0.05 ML and 0.2 ± 0.05 ML, respectively.
The instability of the alloy surface at higher potentials is associated with the second redox couple.
The redox behavior at higher potentials is modified by the presence of CO in stripping experiments, with couples now observed at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE, and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE.

The characterization of the Pt(111)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(111)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces involved vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(111) followed by transfer for electrochemical investigation. These processes were crucial for understanding their electronic and chemical properties related to CO oxidation and fuel cell applications. The characterization included observing surface redox behavior associated with the adsorption and desorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites, which was confirmed by ex situ photoemission measurements indicating changes in the state of Sn atoms under different potentials. A second surface redox couple was identified at higher potentials, which was linked to enhanced oxidation due to CO exclusion at the surface. CO was adsorbed onto the surfaces at specific temperatures, and its oxidation occurred at potentials coinciding with the adsorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites. The stability of the alloy surfaces was affected at higher potentials, leading to changes in redox behavior when CO was present during stripping experiments.

对Pt(111)Sn(2 × 2)和Pt(111)Sn(3 × 3)R30表面的表征包括在Pt(111)上通过蒸汽沉积Sn，随后转移进行电化学研究。这些过程对于理解与CO氧化和燃料电池应用相关的电子和化学性质至关重要。表征包括观察与Sn位点上的羟基吸附和脱附相关的表面还原-氧化行为，这通过离线光发射测量得到了证实，显示在不同电位下Sn原子的状态变化。在较高电位下观察到第二个表面还原-氧化偶，这与CO排除导致表面增强氧化有关。在特定温度下向表面吸附CO，并且在其氧化发生在与Sn位点上的羟基吸附相一致的电位下。合金表面的稳定性在较高电位下受到影响，导致在去除实验中存在CO时红氧化行为的变化。
