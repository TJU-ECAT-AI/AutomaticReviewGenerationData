[1] "The Pt(1 1 1)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(1 1 1)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces have been prepared and characterised in UHV by vapour deposition of Sn on Pt(1 1 1) and the surfaces subsequently transferred for electrochemical investigation."
[2] "Evidence that it is associated with the adsorption of OH comes from ex situ photoemission measurements, which indicate that the Sn atoms are in a metallic state at potentials below 0.15 VRHE, and an oxidised state at potentials above 0.28RHE."
[3] "A second surface redox couple, associated with further oxidation of the Sn sites in the alloy surfaces, is observed at 0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE."
[4] "CO is adsorbed from solution at 300 K, with saturation coverages of 0.37 ± 0.05 ML and 0.2 ± 0.05 ML, respectively."
[5] "This strong promotional effect is unambiguously associated with the bi-functional mechanism."
[6] "The instability of the alloy surface at higher potentials is associated with the second redox couple."
[7] "The redox behaviour at higher potentials is modified by the presence of CO in stripping experiments, with couples now observed at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE, and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows for precise control over the composition and structure of the bimetallic interface, which significantly influences the catalytic activity and selectivity in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

2. The characterization of the Pt(1 1 1)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(1 1 1)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces involved vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(1 1 1), followed by transfer for electrochemical investigation under ultra-high vacuum (UHV). This method ensures the preparation of well-defined surface alloys that can be studied in detail regarding their electronic and chemical properties.

3. The redox behavior of the surfaces indicates that they undergo oxidation at specific potentials, which is associated with the adsorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites. Below 0.15 VRHE, the Sn atoms are in a metallic state, while above 0.28 VRHE, they are in an oxidized state.

4. The adsorption of CO from solution occurs at 300 K with saturation coverages of 0.37 ± 0.05 ML and 0.2 ± 0.05 ML for the two different surfaces. This adsorption is promoted by the presence of hydroxide on the Sn sites, which is a key factor in the electro-oxidation mechanism.

5. The strong promotional effect of CO on the electro-oxidation process is unequivocally linked to the bi-functional mechanism, where CO not only promotes the oxidation but also modifies the redox behavior of the surface.

6. The stability of the alloy surfaces decreases at higher potentials due to the presence of a second redox couple, which affects the surface reactivity and catalytic performance.

7. The presence of CO alters the redox behavior at higher potentials, leading to observable redox couples at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE, indicating enhanced oxidation processes facilitated by CO at the surface.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层进行。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行全面理解至关重要，因为它允许精确控制双金属界面的组成和结构，这对先进表面科学和催化研究中的催化活性和选择性有显著影响。

2. Pt(1 1 1)Sn(2 × 2) 和 Pt(1 1 1)Sn(3 × 3)R30 表面的表征涉及在Pt(1 1 1)上通过蒸汽沉积Sn，然后转移进行电化学研究，在超高真空（UHV）下进行。这种方法确保准备了具有明确表面合金，可以详细研究它们的电子和化学性质。

3. 表面的还原行为表明，它们在特定的电位下发生氧化，这与Sn位点上的羟基吸附有关。低于0.15 VRHE时，Sn原子处于金属状态，高于0.28 VRHE时，则处于氧化状态。

4. CO从溶液中吸附发生在300 K，两种不同表面的饱和覆盖度分别为0.37 ± 0.05 ML和0.2 ± 0.05 ML。这种吸附由Sn位点上的羟基促进，并且是电氧化机制的关键因素。

5. CO对电氧化过程的强大促进作用明确地与二功能机制相关联，其中CO不仅促进氧化，还修改了表面的还原行为。

6. 随着电位的增加，合金表面的稳定性降低，由于第二个还原对的存在，这影响了表面反应性和催化剂性能。

7. CO的存在改变了高电位下的还原行为，导致可观察到的还原对为0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE和0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE，这表明由CO在表面促进的增强氧化过程。
