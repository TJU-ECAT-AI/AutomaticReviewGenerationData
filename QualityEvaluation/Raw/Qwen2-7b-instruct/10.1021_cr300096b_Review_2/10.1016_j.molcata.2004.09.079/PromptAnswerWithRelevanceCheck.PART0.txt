The characterization of the Pt(111)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(111)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces involved vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(111) followed by transfer for electrochemical investigation. These processes were crucial for understanding their electronic and chemical properties related to CO oxidation and fuel cell applications. The characterization included observing surface redox behavior associated with the adsorption and desorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites, which was confirmed by ex situ photoemission measurements indicating changes in the state of Sn atoms under different potentials. A second surface redox couple was identified at higher potentials, which was linked to enhanced oxidation due to CO exclusion at the surface. CO was adsorbed onto the surfaces at specific temperatures, and its oxidation occurred at potentials coinciding with the adsorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites. The stability of the alloy surfaces was affected at higher potentials, leading to changes in redox behavior when CO was present during stripping experiments.

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows for precise control over the composition and structure of the bimetallic interface, which significantly influences the catalytic activity and selectivity in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

2. The characterization of the Pt(1 1 1)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(1 1 1)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces involved vapor deposition of Sn on Pt(1 1 1), followed by transfer for electrochemical investigation under ultra-high vacuum (UHV). This method ensures the preparation of well-defined surface alloys that can be studied in detail regarding their electronic and chemical properties.

3. The redox behavior of the surfaces indicates that they undergo oxidation at specific potentials, which is associated with the adsorption of hydroxide on the Sn sites. Below 0.15 VRHE, the Sn atoms are in a metallic state, while above 0.28 VRHE, they are in an oxidized state.

4. The adsorption of CO from solution occurs at 300 K with saturation coverages of 0.37 ± 0.05 ML and 0.2 ± 0.05 ML for the two different surfaces. This adsorption is promoted by the presence of hydroxide on the Sn sites, which is a key factor in the electro-oxidation mechanism.

5. The strong promotional effect of CO on the electro-oxidation process is unequivocally linked to the bi-functional mechanism, where CO not only promotes the oxidation but also modifies the redox behavior of the surface.

6. The stability of the alloy surfaces decreases at higher potentials due to the presence of a second redox couple, which affects the surface reactivity and catalytic performance.

7. The presence of CO alters the redox behavior at higher potentials, leading to observable redox couples at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE, indicating enhanced oxidation processes facilitated by CO at the surface.

5. CO对电氧化过程的强大促进作用明确地与二功能机制相关联，其中CO不仅促进氧化，还修改了表面的还原行为。

6. 随着电位的增加，合金表面的稳定性降低，由于第二个还原对的存在，这影响了表面反应性和催化剂性能。

7. CO的存在改变了高电位下的还原行为，导致可观察到的还原对为0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE和0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE，这表明由CO在表面促进的增强氧化过程。
