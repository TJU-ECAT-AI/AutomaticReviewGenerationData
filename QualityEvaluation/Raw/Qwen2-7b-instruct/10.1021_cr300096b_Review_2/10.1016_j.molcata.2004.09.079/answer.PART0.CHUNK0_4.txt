[1] "The Pt(1 1 1)Sn(2 × 2) and Pt(1 1 1)Sn(3 × 3)R30 surfaces have been prepared and characterised in UHV by vapour deposition of Sn on Pt(1 1 1) and the surfaces subsequently transferred for electrochemical investigation."
[2] "Evidence that it is associated with the adsorption of OH comes from ex situ photoemission measurements, which indicate that the Sn atoms are in a metallic state at potentials below 0.15 VRHE, and an oxidised state at potentials above 0.28RHE."
[3] "A second surface redox couple, associated with further oxidation of the Sn sites in the alloy surfaces, is observed at 0.8 VRHE/0.58 VRHE."
[4] "CO is adsorbed from solution at 300 K, with saturation coverages of 0.37 ± 0.05 ML and 0.2 ± 0.05 ML, respectively."
[5] "This strong promotional effect is unambiguously associated with the bi-functional mechanism."
[6] "The redox behaviour at higher potentials is modified by the presence of CO in stripping experiments, with couples now observed at 0.78 VRHE/0.56 VRHE, and 0.9 VRHE/0.70 VRHE."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties because it allows for the creation of specific surface compositions that can be precisely controlled. By examining how these surfaces interact with various species such as CO and hydroxide ions under different potentials, researchers gain insights into the mechanisms of catalytic reactions, including the promotion of CO electro-oxidation and the stability of the surface structure. The presence of CO affects the redox behavior at higher potentials, indicating the importance of surface composition in determining catalytic activity and stability.
