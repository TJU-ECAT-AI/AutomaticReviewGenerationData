<p>During surface alloy formation in 1 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface, we quantitatively demonstrate an enhancement in the MO Kerr signal. The maximum enhancement in MO signal is as large as 200% after alloy formation at 710 K.</p>
<p>The formation of CoPt alloy was confirmed by AES and LEED.</p>
<p>The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy persists in the annealing process until the ultrathin film is annealed at temperatures above 850 K.</p>
<p>The enhancement is also observed in thicker films when the formation of CoPt alloy has been developed, but both the out-of-plane and the in-plane anisotropy appear at a higher annealing temperature.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
