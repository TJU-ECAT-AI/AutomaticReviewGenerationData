The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The formation of a CoPt alloy at the interface is confirmed through low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy, demonstrating an enhancement in the MO Kerr signal reaching up to 200% after alloy formation at 710 K. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is observed to persist during the annealing process until the ultrathin film is annealed at temperatures above 850 K. For thicker films, both the out-of-plane and in-plane anisotropy appear at a higher annealing temperature, indicating the importance of the annealing process in achieving specific magnetic properties.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，尤其是在先进表面科学和催化研究领域。通过低能电子衍射和俄歇电子光谱证实了界面处形成CoPt合金，显示在710 K时合金形成后MO克尔信号增强至高达200%。在退火过程中，垂直磁各向异性保持不变，直到超薄薄膜在高于850 K的温度下退火。对于较厚的薄膜，在更高的退火温度下出现垂直和水平两种磁各向异性，表明退火过程对于实现特定磁性性质的重要性。
