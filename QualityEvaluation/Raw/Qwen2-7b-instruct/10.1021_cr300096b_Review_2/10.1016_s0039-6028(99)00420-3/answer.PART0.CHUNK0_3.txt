<p>During surface alloy formation in 1 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface, we quantitatively demonstrate an enhancement in the MO Kerr signal. The maximum enhancement in MO signal is as large as 200% after alloy formation at 710 K. The formation of CoPt alloy was confirmed by AES and LEED.</p>
<p>The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy persists in the annealing process until the ultrathin film is annealed at temperatures above 850 K. The enhancement is also observed in thicker films when the formation of CoPt alloy has been developed, but both the out-of-plane and the in-plane anisotropy appear at a higher annealing temperature.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The method allows for precise control and investigation of the interactions and properties of the two metals at the interface, which is essential for optimizing their performance in various applications such as catalytic processes and material synthesis.
