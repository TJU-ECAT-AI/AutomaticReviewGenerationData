<p>During surface alloy formation in 1 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface, we quantitatively demonstrate an enhancement in the MO Kerr signal. The maximum enhancement in MO signal is as large as 200% after alloy formation at 710 K. The formation of CoPt alloy was confirmed by AES and LEED. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy persists in the annealing process until the ultrathin film is annealed at temperatures above 850 K. The enhancement is also observed in thicker films when the formation of CoPt alloy has been developed, but both the out-of-plane and the in-plane anisotropy appear at a higher annealing temperature.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the enhancement is discussed.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The method allows researchers to tailor the surface properties for specific applications, such as enhancing catalytic activity or improving material performance. By precisely controlling the deposition conditions, the formation of specific interfacial structures can be achieved, leading to unique electronic and chemical behaviors that are essential for various technological advancements.
