The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The quote provided does not specifically address how Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces are characterized, but it does discuss the characterization of Co/Pt(111) surfaces. The key aspects include the use of techniques like AES and LEED to confirm the formation of surface alloys and the examination of magnetic anisotropy under varying conditions.
