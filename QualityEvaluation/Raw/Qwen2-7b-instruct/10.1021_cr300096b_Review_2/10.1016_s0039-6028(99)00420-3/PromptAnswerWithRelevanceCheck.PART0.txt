<p>During surface alloy formation in 1 ML Co on a flat Pt(111) surface, we quantitatively demonstrate an enhancement in the MO Kerr signal. The maximum enhancement in MO signal is as large as 200% after alloy formation at 710 K.</p>
<p>The formation of CoPt alloy was confirmed by AES and LEED.</p>
<p>The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy persists in the annealing process until the ultrathin film is annealed at temperatures above 850 K.</p>
<p>The enhancement is also observed in thicker films when the formation of CoPt alloy has been developed, but both the out-of-plane and the in-plane anisotropy appear at a higher annealing temperature.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The formation of a CoPt alloy at the interface is confirmed through low-energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy, demonstrating an enhancement in the MO Kerr signal reaching up to 200% after alloy formation at 710 K. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy is observed to persist during the annealing process until the ultrathin film is annealed at temperatures above 850 K. For thicker films, both the out-of-plane and in-plane anisotropy appear at a higher annealing temperature, indicating the importance of the annealing process in achieving specific magnetic properties.
