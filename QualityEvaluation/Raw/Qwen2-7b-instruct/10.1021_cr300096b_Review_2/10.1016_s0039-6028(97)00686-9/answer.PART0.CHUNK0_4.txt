[1] "The substrate was a Pt(111) single-crystal disk from the ESPI Corporation. The orientation of the surface was verified to be within 0.5° by X-ray reflection."
[2] "All experiments were conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber described in detail elsewhere [7,8]."
[3] "The Pt(111) substrate was cleaned by cycles of argon-ion bombardment and annealing."
[4] "Deposition of Co was characterized by AES, LEED and a thickness monitor."
[5] "The annealing effect for coverages of 3.2-4 ML (Fig. lh and i) is similar to that for coverages of 0.8-1.2 ML (Fig. lc and d)."
[6] "The phase diagram can be divided into six parts. In region I (low coverages and low temperature), the pseudo-(1 x 1) LEED pattern suggest that the Co overlayer accumulates on Pt(lll) with a reciprocal lattice vector of a ----= apt."
[7] "The UP spectra for 2.0 ML show no significant change during annealing until 650 K, as shown in Fig. 4."
[8] "Taking into account the difference in electronegativity between Pt and Co,a charge transfer from Co sites to Pt sites may occur."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It allows researchers to study the interaction between Ni and Pt, understand the phase diagrams, and observe the structural evolution under various conditions. The use of techniques like AES, LEED, and UPS enables detailed analysis of the surface structure and bonding state. The annealing process affects the phase transition, lattice parameter, and valence band structure, providing insights into the formation of alloys and the changes in electronic properties. This knowledge is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
