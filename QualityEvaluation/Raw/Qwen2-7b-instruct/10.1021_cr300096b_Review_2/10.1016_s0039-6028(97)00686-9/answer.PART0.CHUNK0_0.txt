[1] "Recently, ordered Co and Pt alloys such as CosPt, CoPt and CoPts were investigated."
[2] "Therefore, a basic understanding of the interfacial properties of Co/Pt ultrathin heteroexpitaxial films is of both fundamental and practical importance."
[3] "Low-energy Auger electrons are sensitive to the depth of diffusion for each component, AES was used to study the composition of Co/Pt( 111 ) during the mixing of Co and Pt."
[4] "The appearance of the new peaks on annealing may reflect the formation of Pt-Co bonds."
[5] "The features of peaks P1, P2 and P3 appearing in our UP spectra above 650 K may reflect the onset of alloying to a Co-rich phase."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. AES is utilized to examine the composition during the mixing of Co and Pt, indicating the formation of Pt-Co bonds. The appearance of new peaks during annealing suggests the onset of alloying, particularly to a Co-rich phase, as evidenced by changes in the electronic structure.
