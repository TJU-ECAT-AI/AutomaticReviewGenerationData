The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition is followed by cleaning with cycles of argon-ion bombardment and annealing. Chemical impurities are checked using Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES). Cobalt atoms are evaporated using a cobalt wire coil, and the deposition is characterized by AES, Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), and a thickness monitor. The annealing process reaches a temperature of 1100 K, and the surface is monitored for a well-ordered p(1 x 1) LEED pattern with bright, sharp LEED spots and a low background. The phase diagram of the Co/Pt system, divided into six parts, is summarized. In regions where alloys are formed, the LEED pattern is close to p(1 x 1), and the reciprocal lattice vector a* approaches that of Co. AES verifies the formation of the alloy. The appearance of new peaks during annealing reflects the formation of Pt-Co bonds, indicating a shift to higher binding energy due to bond strengthening, which provides evidence of the structure of the Co-Pt alloy film.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。沉积后，通过氩离子轰击和退火进行清洁。使用AES检查表面的化学杂质。使用钴线圈蒸发钴原子，并通过AES、低能电子衍射（LEED）和厚度监测来表征沉积过程。退火过程达到1100 K的温度，并监控形成明亮、尖锐的LEED斑点和低背景的p(1 x 1) LEED模式。总结了Co/Pt系统的相图，分为六个部分。在合金形成区域，LEED模式接近p(1 x 1)，且倒易点阵矢量a*接近Co的值。AES验证了合金的形成。在退火过程中出现的新峰反映了Pt-Co键的形成，这导致结合能升高，提供了Co-Pt合金薄膜结构的证据。
