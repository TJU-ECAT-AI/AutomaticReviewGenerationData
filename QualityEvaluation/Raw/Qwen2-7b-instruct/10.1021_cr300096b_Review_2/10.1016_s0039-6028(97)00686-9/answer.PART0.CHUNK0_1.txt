The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The details provided in the literature pertain to cobalt (Co) films on Pt(111), which can serve as a comparable example for Ni/Pt systems. The literature discusses how Co films evolve structurally upon annealing, including the formation of various phases such as pseudo-(1 x 1), incoherent epitaxy, extra p(2 x 2), rotational incoherent epitaxy, and alloying (1 x 1) structures. The changes in valence-band structures during phase transitions were studied by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), which provides insights into the electronic properties of these films. AES was used to verify alloy formation, indicating the presence of mixed Co-Pt bonds and potential charge transfer between the metals due to differences in electronegativity. The phase diagrams obtained from LEED observations categorize the different structural phases observed under varying coverages and temperatures.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。文献中关于Co薄膜在Pt(111)上的描述可以作为Ni/Pt系统的一个类比示例。文献讨论了在退火过程中Co薄膜的结构演变，包括伪(1 x 1)、非相干外延生长、额外的p(2 x 2)、旋转非相干外延生长和合金化（1 x 1）结构等阶段。通过紫外线光电子能谱（UPS）研究了相转变期间价带结构的变化，提供了这些薄膜的电子性质的见解。使用AES验证了合金形成，表明存在混合的Co-Pt键，并且由于两种金属电负性的差异，可能发生了两者的电荷转移。通过LEED观察获得的相图将不同的结构阶段分类在不同的覆盖度和温度下。
