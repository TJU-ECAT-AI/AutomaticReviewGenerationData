The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The details provided in the literature pertain to cobalt (Co) films on Pt(111), which can serve as a comparable example for Ni/Pt systems. The literature discusses how Co films evolve structurally upon annealing, including the formation of various phases such as pseudo-(1 x 1), incoherent epitaxy, extra p(2 x 2), rotational incoherent epitaxy, and alloying (1 x 1) structures. The changes in valence-band structures during phase transitions were studied by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), which provides insights into the electronic properties of these films. AES was used to verify alloy formation, indicating the presence of mixed Co-Pt bonds and potential charge transfer between the metals due to differences in electronegativity. The phase diagrams obtained from LEED observations categorize the different structural phases observed under varying coverages and temperatures.

This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Key steps include cleaning the substrate through cycles of argon-ion bombardment and annealing, using a cobalt wire coil to evaporate Co atoms with a purity of 99.997%, and monitoring deposition rate. Techniques like AES, LEED, and a thickness monitor are utilized to characterize the deposition process. The annealing temperature reached was 1100 K. The substrate's orientation is verified to be within 0.5° by X-ray reflection. The LEED technique is employed to study the structural evolution of the Co/Pt(111) system at various temperatures and coverages. The annealing effect varies for different coverage levels, and a phase diagram is summarized to categorize the structural phases observed. The valence band structure shows significant changes during phase transitions, indicating the onset of alloying to a Co-rich phase. The appearance of new peaks on annealing reflects the formation of Pt-Co bonds and a shift in binding energy due to bond strengthening. The UP spectra for 1.0ML Co/Pt(lll) demonstrate variations in peaks P1, P2, P3, and P4 at higher temperatures, which align with the alloy formation studied by LEED.
