[1] "In the last years thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between physical properties of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity."
[2] "The Pd coverage of the films was kept below 70% in order to avoid the formation of three- dimensional islands. Therefore, the catalytic activity for CO oxidation can be compared at the free Pt sites and Pd islands of monoatomic height having the same surface structure."
[3] "In the polarization curves shown in Fig. 1 the influence of Pd is obvious. With an increasing Pd surface coverage the potential where the maximum current density (diffusion limited current density) is obtained in the positive going scan shifts to higher potentials (see dashed line as a guide for the eye)."
[4] "In comparison to the just described IR spectra of Pt(1 0 0), the infrared spectra of Pt(1 0 0) modified by a Pd submonolayer (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) exhibit an additional CO absorption band located at about 1920 cm1."
[5] "Interestingly, and in contrast to the PdxMLPt(1 1 1) [10,23] system, (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) unambiguously show that as the potential is stepped more positive than 0.3 V the PdCO band disappears before the PtCO band does."

2.7. "Therefore, determination of the Pd coverage is, therefore, not straight- forward. A rough estimation (following the method of Llorca et al.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves the deposition of a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process allows for the examination of the morphology and stability of the bimetallic films. Techniques such as in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are utilized to gain insights into the surface properties. SXS measurements demonstrate that the deposited films are pseudomorphic, meaning that the Ni atoms occupy commensurate Pt sites, preserving the ABC stacking pattern of the Pt substrate. This pseudomorphic nature is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, which can significantly impact their catalytic activity. The detailed information gathered through these techniques aids in the development of theoretical models and computational simulations (DFT calculations), providing a comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. It allows researchers to understand the surface morphology and stability, which are essential for electrocatalytic activity. Surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are utilized to examine the structure of Pd films on Pt(111). These methods demonstrate that the deposited films are pseudomorphic, indicating that Pd atoms occupy commensurate Pt sites, maintaining the ABC stacking of the Pt substrate. FTIR characterization helps determine whether Pd atoms form islands or disperse randomly on the surface, providing insights into their surface chemistry. The appearance of distinct CO stretching bands corresponding to CO adsorbed on Pt and Pd indicates that Pd atoms cluster into islands, and Pt and Pd exhibit unique surface behaviors. Much less information exists for Pd films on Pt(100) compared to Pt(111), and previous studies have focused on Pd multilayers. The catalytic activity for CO oxidation can be compared at free Pt sites and Pd islands of the same surface structure. CO bulk oxidation experiments are performed to assess the influence of Pd deposition on Pt(100) surfaces. As the Pd surface coverage increases, the potential for achieving the maximum current density shifts to higher values. The pre-ignition potential region shows higher CO oxidation currents on Pd-modified Pt surfaces compared to bare Pt(100). Infrared spectra reveal that Pt(100) modified by a Pd submonolayer exhibits additional CO absorption bands. A time-dependent series of spectra at a fixed potential demonstrates that the PdCO band disappears before the PtCO band does, indicating preferential oxidation of CO on Pd surfaces. On Pd-modified Pt(100) surfaces, CO is oxidatively removed from the surface at a potential of about 0.3 V, likely through a reaction with OHad via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。通过表面X射线散射（SXS）和傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱等方法，研究者可以了解铂表面的形态和稳定性，这对于电催化活性至关重要。SXS实验表明，沉积的薄膜具有拟相性，这意味着Pd原子占据与Pt相匹配的Pt位点，维持了Pt(111)基底的ABC堆叠。FTIR表征有助于确定Pd原子是否形成岛屿或在表面上随机分散，提供它们表面化学行为的见解。CO吸附在Pt和Pd上的不同伸缩模式表明Pd原子聚集成岛屿，并且Pt和Pd表现出独特的表面行为。关于Pt(100)基底上的Pd薄膜的信息远少于Pt(111)，之前的研究所关注的是Pd多层。可以通过比较自由Pt位点和具有相同表面结构的Pd岛屿的催化活性来评估CO氧化作用。随着Pd表面覆盖率的增加，实现最大电流密度的潜在值向更高值移动。在预点火电压区域，Pd修饰的Pt表面的CO氧化电流高于裸露的Pt(100)表面。红外光谱显示，Pt(100)由Pd亚单层修饰后会出现额外的CO吸收带。在固定电压下的一系列时间依赖谱图表明，PdCO带消失在PtCO带之前，表明CO在Pd表面的优先氧化。在Pd修饰的Pt(100)表面上，当电压约为0.3伏时，开始从表面氧化CO，可能通过OHad与Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制反应。
