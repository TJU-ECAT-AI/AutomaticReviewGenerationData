2.1. "In the last years thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between physical properties of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity [113]."
2.2. "For example the morphology and stability of Pd films on Pt(1 1 1) were examined by utilizing in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) [12,14] and FTIR [10,13] measure- ments."
2.3. "SXS studies demonstrated that electrochemically deposited films are pseudomorphic, whereby the Pd atoms occupy commensurate Pt sites such as to continue the ABC stacking of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
2.4. "Compared to PdxMLPt(1 1 1), much less information is available for palladium films supported on a Pt(1 0 0) substrate and previous investigations were mainly fo- cused on Pd multilayers [6,8,16,17]."
2.5. "In this study Pd submonolayers deposited on Pt(1 0 0) are investigated in perchloric acid solution by means of cyclic voltammetry, CO oxidation with in a rotating disk-electrode (RDE) configuration in CO saturated electrolyte (CO bulk oxidation), and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy."
2.6. "The appearance of separate CO stretching bands, corresponding to CO adsorbed on Pt and Pd indicated that Pd atoms cluster into islands and that Pt and Pd behave according to their own sur- face chemistry."
2.7. "Therefore, determination of the Pd coverage is, therefore, not straight- forward. A rough estimation (following the method of Llorca et al. [8]) based on the charges of the hydrogen desorption and sulfate adsorption peaks assigned to Pt and Pd in the voltammograms in sulfuric acid solution leads to values of about 40 and 60% Pd coverage after 5 and 10 min deposition time,respectively."
2.8. "Analyzing the polarization curves shown in Fig. 1 the influence of Pd is obvious. With an 810"
2.9. "Furthermore, it can be observed that in the negative going sweep the oxidation current drops earlier (at higher potentials) to zero on Pd modified than on bare Pt(1 0 0) and therefore showing a lower hysteresis in the polarization curves."
2.10. "In comparison to the just described IR spectra of Pt(1 0 0), the infrared spectra of Pt(1 0 0) modified by a Pd submonolayer (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) exhibit an addi- tional CO absorption band located at about 1920 cm1."
2.11. "Based on IR spectra,therefore, it is reasonable to propose that there is no strong coupling between CO adsorbed on Pt and on Pd and that Pd and Pt atoms behave independent from each other according to their own surface chemistry."
2.12. "A close inspection of the band position for CO bonded atop on Pt, however, clearly shows that once the potential is stepped from 0.0 to 0.4 V the band position shifts from 2058 to 2047 cm1 within 5 min."
2.13. "In summary, on Pd modified Pt(1 0 0) surfaces start- ing at a potential of about 0.3 V COad is oxidatively removed from the surface (see CO2 bands in (Fig. 2),presumably by the reaction with OHad through a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism [24], i.e.: COad  OHad ! CO2  H  e 1"

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves the deposition of a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process allows for the examination of the morphology and stability of the bimetallic films. Techniques such as in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are utilized to gain insights into the surface properties. SXS measurements demonstrate that the deposited films are pseudomorphic, meaning that the Ni atoms occupy commensurate Pt sites, preserving the ABC stacking pattern of the Pt substrate. This pseudomorphic nature is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, which can significantly impact their catalytic activity. The detailed information gathered through these techniques aids in the development of theoretical models and computational simulations (DFT calculations), providing a comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

如何对在单晶Pt（111）或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层形成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，以及这一过程为何对于结构建模、DFT计算和我们对这些双金属表面电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要？

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程允许研究双金属薄膜的形态和稳定性。使用原位表面X射线散射（SXS）和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）等技术来深入了解表面性质。SXS测量表明，沉积的薄膜是拟相容的，这意味着Ni原子占据与Pt基底ABC堆叠模式相匹配的Pt位点，从而保持了Pt基底的结构。这种拟相容性对于理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为这些性质可能显著影响它们的催化活性。通过这些技术收集的详细信息有助于开发理论模型和计算模拟（DFT计算），提供对双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下全面理解的基础。
