          [1] "In the last years thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between physical properties of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity [113]."
          [2] "For example the morphology and stability of Pd films on Pt(1 1 1) were examined by utilizing in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) [12,14] and FTIR [10,13] measure- ments."
          [3] "SXS studies demonstrated that electrochemically deposited films are pseudomorphic, whereby the Pd at- oms occupy commensurate Pt sites such as to continue the ABC stacking of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
          [4] "Compared to PdxMLPt(1 1 1), much less information is available for palladium films supported on a Pt(1 0 0) substrate and previous investigations were mainly fo- cused on Pd multilayers [6,8,16,17]."
          [5] "In this study Pd submonolayers deposited on Pt(1 0 0) are investigated in perchloric acid solution by means of cyclic voltammetry, CO oxidation with in a rotating disk-electrode (RDE) configuration in CO saturated electrolyte (CO bulk oxidation), and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the structural properties, conducting DFT calculations, and comprehending the electronic and chemical characteristics of these surfaces in the field of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows for a detailed examination of how the physical properties of the surface correlate with its electrocatalytic activity.
