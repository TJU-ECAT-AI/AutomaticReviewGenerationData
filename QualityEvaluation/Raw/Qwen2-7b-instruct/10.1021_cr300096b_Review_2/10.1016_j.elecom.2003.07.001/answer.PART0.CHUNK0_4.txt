2.1. "In the last years thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between physical properties of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity."
2.2. "For example the morphology and stability of Pd films on Pt(1 1 1) were examined by utilizing in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) [12,14] and FTIR [10,13] measure- ments."
2.3. "SXS studies demonstrated that electrochemically deposited films are pseudomorphic, whereby the Pd atoms occupy commensurate Pt sites such as to continue the ABC stacking of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
2.4. "FTIR characterization of Pt(1 1 1) COad modified with Pd (0ML < HPd < 1ML) was used as an indirect method to establish whether Pd forms 2D islands or whether Pd atoms disperse on the surface much more randomly, as seen for the deposition of Bi on transition metals [15]."
2.5. "The appearance of separate CO stretching bands, corresponding to CO adsorbed on Pt and Pd indicated that Pd atoms cluster into islands and that Pt and Pd behave according to their own sur- face chemistry."
2.6. "Compared to PdxMLPt(1 1 1), much less information is available for palladium films supported on a Pt(1 0 0) substrate and previous investigations were mainly fo- cused on Pd multilayers [6,8,16,17]."
2.7. "Therefore, the catalytic activity for CO oxidation can be compared at the free Pt sites and Pd islands of monoatomic height having the same surface structure."
2.8. "For recording the polarization curves in CO saturated electrolyte (CO bulk oxidation), the electrolyte was saturated with CO for at least 5 min while holding the potential at 0.05 V."
2.9. "In order to probe the influence of Pd adatoms de- posited (in the submonolayer coverage regime) on Pt(1 0 0) on the electrooxidation of carbon monoxide CO bulk oxidation experiments were performed for all three surfaces."
2.10. "Analyzing the polarization curves shown in Fig. 1 the influence of Pd is obvious. With an 810 M. Arenz et al. / Electrochemistry Communications 5 (2003) 809813 increasing Pd surface coverage the potential where the maximum current density (diffusion limited current density) is obtained in the positive going scan shifts to higher potentials (see dashed line as a guide for the eye)."
2.11. "Turning our attention to the so-called pre-ignition potential region, the potential region in the polarization curves before reaching the diffusion limited current density [24], the CO oxidation currents are higher on Pd modified Pt compared bare Pt(1 0 0)."
2.12. "In comparison to the just described IR spectra of Pt(1 0 0), the infrared spectra of Pt(1 0 0) modified by a Pd submonolayer (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) exhibit an addi- tional CO absorption band located at about 1920 cm1."
2.13. "In order to investigate this phenomenon, which obvi- ously contradicts a simultaneous CO oxidation on Pt and Pd sites, a time-dependent series of spectra of the incipient CO oxidation on Pd0:5MLPt(1 0 0) at a fixed potential of 0.4 V is shown in Fig. 3."
2.14. "Interestingly, and in contrast to the PdxMLPt(1 1 1) [10,23] system, (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) unambiguously show that as the potential is stepped more positive than 0.3 V the PdCO band disappears before the PtCO band does."
2.15. "In summary, on Pd modified Pt(1 0 0) surfaces start- ing at a potential of about 0.3 V COad is oxidatively removed from the surface (see CO2 bands in (Fig. 2),presumably by the reaction with OHad through a LangmuirHinshelwood mechanism [24], i.e.: COad  OHad ! CO2  H  e 1"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. It allows researchers to understand the surface morphology and stability, which are essential for electrocatalytic activity. Surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are utilized to examine the structure of Pd films on Pt(111). These methods demonstrate that the deposited films are pseudomorphic, indicating that Pd atoms occupy commensurate Pt sites, maintaining the ABC stacking of the Pt substrate. FTIR characterization helps determine whether Pd atoms form islands or disperse randomly on the surface, providing insights into their surface chemistry. The appearance of distinct CO stretching bands corresponding to CO adsorbed on Pt and Pd indicates that Pd atoms cluster into islands, and Pt and Pd exhibit unique surface behaviors. Much less information exists for Pd films on Pt(100) compared to Pt(111), and previous studies have focused on Pd multilayers. The catalytic activity for CO oxidation can be compared at free Pt sites and Pd islands of the same surface structure. CO bulk oxidation experiments are performed to assess the influence of Pd deposition on Pt(100) surfaces. As the Pd surface coverage increases, the potential for achieving the maximum current density shifts to higher values. The pre-ignition potential region shows higher CO oxidation currents on Pd-modified Pt surfaces compared to bare Pt(100). Infrared spectra reveal that Pt(100) modified by a Pd submonolayer exhibits additional CO absorption bands. A time-dependent series of spectra at a fixed potential demonstrates that the PdCO band disappears before the PtCO band does, indicating preferential oxidation of CO on Pd surfaces. On Pd-modified Pt(100) surfaces, CO is oxidatively removed from the surface at a potential of about 0.3 V, likely through a reaction with OHad via a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。通过表面X射线散射（SXS）和傅里叶变换红外（FTIR）光谱等方法，研究者可以了解铂表面的形态和稳定性，这对于电催化活性至关重要。SXS实验表明，沉积的薄膜具有拟相性，这意味着Pd原子占据与Pt相匹配的Pt位点，维持了Pt(111)基底的ABC堆叠。FTIR表征有助于确定Pd原子是否形成岛屿或在表面上随机分散，提供它们表面化学行为的见解。CO吸附在Pt和Pd上的不同伸缩模式表明Pd原子聚集成岛屿，并且Pt和Pd表现出独特的表面行为。关于Pt(100)基底上的Pd薄膜的信息远少于Pt(111)，之前的研究所关注的是Pd多层。可以通过比较自由Pt位点和具有相同表面结构的Pd岛屿的催化活性来评估CO氧化作用。随着Pd表面覆盖率的增加，实现最大电流密度的潜在值向更高值移动。在预点火电压区域，Pd修饰的Pt表面的CO氧化电流高于裸露的Pt(100)表面。红外光谱显示，Pt(100)由Pd亚单层修饰后会出现额外的CO吸收带。在固定电压下的一系列时间依赖谱图表明，PdCO带消失在PtCO带之前，表明CO在Pd表面的优先氧化。在Pd修饰的Pt(100)表面上，当电压约为0.3伏时，开始从表面氧化CO，可能通过OHad与Langmuir-Hinshelwood机制反应。
