[1] "In the last years thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between physical properties of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity."
[2] "The Pd coverage of the films was kept below 70% in order to avoid the formation of three- dimensional islands. Therefore, the catalytic activity for CO oxidation can be compared at the free Pt sites and Pd islands of monoatomic height having the same surface structure."
[3] "In the polarization curves shown in Fig. 1 the influence of Pd is obvious. With an increasing Pd surface coverage the potential where the maximum current density (diffusion limited current density) is obtained in the positive going scan shifts to higher potentials (see dashed line as a guide for the eye)."
[4] "In comparison to the just described IR spectra of Pt(1 0 0), the infrared spectra of Pt(1 0 0) modified by a Pd submonolayer (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) exhibit an additional CO absorption band located at about 1920 cm1."
[5] "Interestingly, and in contrast to the PdxMLPt(1 1 1) [10,23] system, (Figs. 2(b) and (c)) unambiguously show that as the potential is stepped more positive than 0.3 V the PdCO band disappears before the PtCO band does."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the structural properties, conducting DFT calculations, and comprehending the electronic and chemical characteristics of these surfaces in the field of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows for a detailed examination of how the physical properties of the surface correlate with its electrocatalytic activity.
