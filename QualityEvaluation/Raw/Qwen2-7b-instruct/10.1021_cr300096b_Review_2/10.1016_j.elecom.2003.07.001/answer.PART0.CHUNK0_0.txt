[1] "In the last years thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between physical properties of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity [113]."
[2] "For example the morphology and stability of Pd films on Pt(1 1 1) were examined by utilizing in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) [12,14] and FTIR [10,13] measure- ments."
[3] "SXS studies demonstrated that electrochemically deposited films are pseudomorphic, whereby the Pd at- oms occupy commensurate Pt sites such as to continue the ABC stacking of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
[4] "Compared to PdxMLPt(1 1 1), much less information is available for palladium films supported on a Pt(1 0 0) substrate and previous investigations were mainly fo- cused on Pd multilayers [6,8,16,17]."
[5] "In this study Pd submonolayers deposited on Pt(1 0 0) are investigated in perchloric acid solution by means of cyclic voltammetry, CO oxidation with in a rotating disk-electrode (RDE) configuration in CO saturated electrolyte (CO bulk oxidation), and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy are utilized to examine the morphology and stability of the Pd films on Pt(111), demonstrating that they are pseudomorphic, occupying commensurate Pt sites to maintain the ABC stacking pattern of the substrate. This detailed characterization is essential for comprehending the behavior of bimetallic surfaces and optimizing their catalytic performance.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模和第一性原理计算至关重要，因为它允许研究者理解这些表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质。表面X射线散射（SXS）和傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）被用来研究Pt(111)上的Pd薄膜的形态和稳定性，证明它们是拟同型的，占据与基质相匹配的Pt位点，以维持ABC堆叠模式的Pt(111)子晶格。这种详细表征对于理解双金属表面的行为并优化其催化性能至关重要。
