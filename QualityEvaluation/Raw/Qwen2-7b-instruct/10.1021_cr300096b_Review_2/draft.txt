        The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It utilizes synchrotron radiation, specifically the SA73b beamline with a TGM7 monochromator, for experiments conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with a hemispherical analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are obtained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV, 8 μA cm−) followed by annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The growth process up to 2 ML reveals the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy, characterized by a bulk-like peak (B*) at 71.0 ± 0.03 eV and a surface-like peak (S*) at 70.6 ± 0.03 eV. The relative variation of the intensity is +10%. Annealing affects the alloy structure, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. After annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 × 2) with low background intensities.

        This process allows for the detailed analysis of the structure of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The synthesized understanding from these references provides insights into the electronic states of the surface atoms, influenced by the presence of subsurface Ni atoms. This leads to the weakening of metal-adsorbate bonds, attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms by the subsurface Ni atoms. The adsorption of ethylene molecules on these surfaces is influenced by the substrate's topography, impacting the stability and reactivity of adsorbates.

        The integrative understanding and prospective outlook section suggests that the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces opens up avenues for exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the unique electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces to enhance catalytic activity, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis. The exploration of novel synthesis methods, structural modifications, and computational approaches could lead to the development of more efficient and selective catalysts for various industrial applications. Additionally, there is a need to investigate the dynamic behavior of these surfaces under different conditions, including temperature changes and exposure to various gases, to better understand their performance in real-world scenarios.

        The comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces thus serves as a cornerstone for advancing our understanding of surface science and catalysis, paving the way for the design of next-generation materials with enhanced functionalities.
