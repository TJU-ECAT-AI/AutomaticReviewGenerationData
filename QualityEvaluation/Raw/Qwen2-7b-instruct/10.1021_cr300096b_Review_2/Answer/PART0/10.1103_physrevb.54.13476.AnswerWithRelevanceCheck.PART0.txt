          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves synthesizing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface morphology, which directly influences the material's properties.
