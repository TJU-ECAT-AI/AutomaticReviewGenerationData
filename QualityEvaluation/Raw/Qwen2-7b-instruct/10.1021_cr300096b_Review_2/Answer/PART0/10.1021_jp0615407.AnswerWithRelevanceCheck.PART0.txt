          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
