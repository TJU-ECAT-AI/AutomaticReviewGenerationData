It includes studying the Pt-Cu system as part of a broader research project on thin films and surface alloys. Experiments utilize synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring in Orsay, France, with a base pressure of 8 x 10^-11 Torr during analysis. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are prepared through cycles of argon-ion sputtering at 600 eV, 8 μA cm-.

Even at the lowest coverage, two contributions are evident in the Pt 4f core level. Up to 1 ML, there is a linear increase in the intensity. Between 1 and 2 ML, the surface peak intensity evolves slowly. For higher coverage, the peaks S* and B* vanish, and a new surface peak S at 70.75 ± 0.03 eV is observed.

After annealing at 300°C for 30 min with an initial Pt deposition of 3 ML, the Pt 4f core-level spectrum is analyzed before and after annealing (Fig. 2a and 2b).
