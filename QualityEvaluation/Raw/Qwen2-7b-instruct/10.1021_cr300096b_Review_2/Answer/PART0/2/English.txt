The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It includes studying the Pt-Cu system as part of a broader research project on thin films and surface alloys. Experiments utilize synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring in Orsay, France, with a base pressure of 8 x 10^-11 Torr during analysis. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are prepared through cycles of argon-ion sputtering at 600 eV, 8 μA cm-. The Pt deposition rate is determined using either a quartz balance monitor or by comparing the intensities of the Pt and Cu Auger transitions with previous findings by Graham et al. [12]. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is examined with 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The Pt 4f core-level spectrum is shown in Fig. la. Even at the lowest coverage, two contributions are evident in the Pt 4f core level. Up to 1 ML, there is a linear increase in the intensity. Between 1 and 2 ML, the surface peak intensity evolves slowly. For higher coverage, the peaks S* and B* vanish, and a new surface peak S at 70.75 ± 0.03 eV is observed. LEED patterns are monitored during Pt deposition, evolving from a sharp p(1 x 1) with low-intensity background to a diffuse p(1 x 1) with high-intensity background for 3 ML deposition. The thermal behavior of Pt/Cu(100) thin films is also investigated. After annealing at 300°C for 30 min with an initial Pt deposition of 3 ML, the Pt 4f core-level spectrum is analyzed before and after annealing (Fig. 2a and 2b). Annealing affects the Pt concentration in the substrate, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the B and S peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. Following annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities. The growth of Pt/Cu(100) is observed to differ from the layer-by-layer growth model.
