          [11] "For higher coverage, the peaks S* and B* disappear and we obtain a new surface peak S at 70.75 5 0.03 eV."
          [12] "LEED patterns were monitored periodically during Pt deposition."
          [13] "The patterns were found to evolve from a sharp p(1 x 1) with low-intensity background to a diffuse p( 1 x 1) with high-intensity background for 3 ML deposition."
          [14] "We also studied the thermal behaviour of Pt/Cu(lOO) thin films."

          [16] "The effects of annealing are two-fold: first, the inten- sities of B and S decrease, indicating that Pt diffuses into the Cu substrate, and second, the B and S peaks shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively."
          [17] "After annealing, the LEED patterns became sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities."

[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through various techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
          [2] "This process is crucial for structural modeling, as it allows researchers to determine the precise arrangement of atoms on the surface, which influences the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces."
          [3] "DFT calculations are then performed to further understand the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of the bimetallic surfaces, providing insights into their reactivity and catalytic performance."
          [4] "A comprehensive understanding of these properties is essential for the development of advanced surface science and catalysis research, enabling the design of more efficient catalysts and materials for industrial applications."

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts are often used in industrial reactions in order to improve the activity and/or selectivity."
          [2] "Among these systems, it has been found that PtNi alloy single crystal surfaces show surface enrichment of one component, depending on the surface orientation; i.e., Pt enrichment at the first layer and Ni enrichment in the second layer for (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, reverse order for (1 1 0) surface."
          [3] "For the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloy surface, the outer layer with a quasi complete Pt layer exhibits very weakened chemisorptive properties compared to Pt(1 1 1), leading to more selective hydrogenation of butadiene toward butene."
          [4] "As an alternative approach to better understand the fundamental properties and reactivity of PtNi bimetallic surfaces, a model bimetallic surface can be prepared by depositing Pt atoms onto Ni(1 0 0) surface as a substrate."
          [5] "In the present study, we have studied the adsorption of ethylene and hydrogen on Pt thin films grown on Ni(1 0 0) substrate in order to explore the relation between surface structure and its related electronic states and chemical reactivity of PtNi alloy in an atomic level."
          [6] "The growth mode of Pt thin films on Ni(1 0 0) surface was studied by XPS."
          [7] "From these results, the attenuation coefficient of the Ni signal by a monolayer of Pt is found to be 0.64, leading to a mean free path for 400 eV electron of about 2.8 ML."
          [8] "The 1 ML Pt overlayer, as a model (1 0 0) surface of PtNi alloy single crystal, shows a considerable d-band narrowing probably due to the formation of an interface state with the Ni substrate."
          [9] "This greatly weakens the bonding energy of hydrogen atoms as well as ethylene molecule, thus causing the maximum evolution of ethane around 200 K."
          [10] "In contrast, the development of a wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy characteristic of bulk Pt electronic states upon increasing the Pt coverage from 1 to 6 ML, leads to a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as on Pt(1 1 1) surface."
          [11] "Through the examination of this model system it is evident that a high reactivity for the hydrogenation reactions is originated from the modification of the electronic structure in the topmost Pt layer of alloy."
