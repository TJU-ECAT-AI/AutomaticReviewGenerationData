This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Techniques such as AES, LEED, LEIS, XPS, and STM are utilized to determine the surface composition and structure. These techniques provide insights into the electronic states of the surface atoms, which are influenced by the presence of subsurface Ni atoms. The weakening of metal-adsorbate bonds is attributed to the modification of the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms by the subsurface Ni atoms.", "Chinese": "对于通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征至关重要。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。使用AES、LEED、LEIS、XPS和STM等表面光谱技术来确定表面组成和结构。这些技术提供了有关表面原子电子状态的见解，这些状态受到表面下Ni原子存在的影响。金属-吸附剂键的减弱归因于表面Pt原子由表面下Ni原子修饰的电子结构。", "Doi": "10.1016/j.susc.2003.09.007"},
