[1] "In the last years thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between physical properties of a surface and its electrocatalytic activity [113]."
          [2] "For example the morphology and stability of Pd films on Pt(1 1 1) were examined by utilizing in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) [12,14] and FTIR [10,13] measure- ments."
          [3] "SXS studies demonstrated that electrochemically deposited films are pseudomorphic, whereby the Pd at- oms occupy commensurate Pt sites such as to continue the ABC stacking of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate."
          [4] "Compared to PdxMLPt(1 1 1), much less information is available for palladium films supported on a Pt(1 0 0) substrate and previous investigations were mainly fo- cused on Pd multilayers [6,8,16,17]."
          [5] "In this study Pd submonolayers deposited on Pt(1 0 0) are investigated in perchloric acid solution by means of cyclic voltammetry, CO oxidation with in a rotating disk-electrode (RDE) configuration in CO saturated electrolyte (CO bulk oxidation), and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy."

[1] "Experiments were performed in three different UHV chambers. Temperature programmed desorption experiments were performed in a UHV chamber equipped with AES, LEED optics and a quadrupole mass spectrometer."
          [2] "In order to understand the structure and composition of the active bimetallic surface, a battery of surface spectroscopic techniques has been utilized in parallel with reaction studies."
          [3] "This combination of experiments and theory has elucidated the structure of the active Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surfaces as well as the nature of the change in chemical reactivity."
          [4] "Subsurface Ni atoms modify the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms, giving rise to the weaker metaladsorbate bonds observed in the Ni/Pt(1 1 1) alloy systems."

[1] "The experiments were carried out using synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring, Orsay, France."
          [2] "The beamline used was SA73b with a TGM7 monochromator."
          [3] "The experiments were performed in a stainless-steel UHV chamber. The system was equipped with a hemispherical analyser for PES, a cylindrical mirror analyser (CMA) for AES, and LEED apparatus."
          [4] "Clean Cu( 100) single-crystal surfaces were obtained by repeated cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV,8 ,uA cm-) and annealing at 850 K."
          [5] "To study the Pt 4f,,, photoemission line (bulk binding energy (BE) 7 1.15 eV), the photon energy was set to 150 eV using p-polarisation."
          [6] "Fig. 2a shows the decomposition of the spectra corresponding to 0.5-3 ML Pt deposition."
          [7] "Up to 2 ML we found the same pair of peaks,i.e. a bulk-like peak (labelled B*) at 71.0f0.03 eV, and a surface-like peak (labelled S*) at 70.6 +0.03 eV."
          [8] "The relative variation of the intensity is + 10%."
          [9] "The effects of annealing are two-fold: first, the inten- sities of B and S decrease, indicating that Pt diffuses into the Cu substrate, and second, the B and S peaks shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively."
          [10] "After annealing, the LEED patterns became sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities."
