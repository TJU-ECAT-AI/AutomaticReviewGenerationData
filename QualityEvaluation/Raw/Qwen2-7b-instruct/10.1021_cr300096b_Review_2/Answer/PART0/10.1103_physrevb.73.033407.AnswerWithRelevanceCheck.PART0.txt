          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves synthesizing these surfaces by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the field of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
