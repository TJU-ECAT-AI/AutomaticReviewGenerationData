          [1] "The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same."
          [2] "This features which occurs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces."

          The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to study the interactions and properties at the interface between the two metals. Information on microscopic work function distributions and the long-range effect of work function reduction provides insights into the electronic structure and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for the design and optimization of catalysts and other materials.

          Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够研究两种金属之间的界面相互作用和性质。关于微观工作函数分布的信息和工作函数减少的远距离效应为理解双金属表面的电子结构和反应性提供了见解，这对于设计和优化催化剂和其他材料至关重要。
