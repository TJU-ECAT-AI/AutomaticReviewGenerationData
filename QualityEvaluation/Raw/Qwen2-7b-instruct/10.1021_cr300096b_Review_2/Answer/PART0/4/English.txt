The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves the study of their structure through techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows scientists to understand the precise arrangement of atoms on the surface. For Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, detailed information about the bonding and electronic states of the surface is required, which is provided by these characterization methods. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, this understanding is essential for predicting and optimizing the catalytic activity of these bimetallic surfaces.
