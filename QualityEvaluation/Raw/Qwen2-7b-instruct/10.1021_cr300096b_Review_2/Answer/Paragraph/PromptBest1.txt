        The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It utilizes synchrotron radiation, specifically the SA73b beamline with a TGM7 monochromator, for experiments conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with a hemispherical analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are obtained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV, 8 μA cm−) followed by annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The growth process up to 2 ML reveals the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy, characterized by a bulk-like peak (B*) at 71.0 ± 0.03 eV and a surface-like peak (S*) at 70.6 ± 0.03 eV. The relative variation of the intensity is +10%. Annealing affects the alloy structure, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. After annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 × 2) with low background intensities.

        The effects of annealing are twofold: first, the intensities of B and S decrease, indicating that Pt diffuses into the Cu substrate, and second, the B and S peaks shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. This process also facilitates stress relief via island formation of an isotropically strained bimetallic surface layer, leading to the mesoscopic morphology of the Ag/Pt (111) surface alloy.

        The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface, despite their similar Ag coverages and macroscopic work functions. This feature, occurring when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers, is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction observed for Cs-adsorption surfaces.

        Atomic scale investigations of the Co/Pt(111) interface structure and magnetic properties, as reported in reference \[10.1063/1.1388156\], provide further insights into the intricate interactions at the metal-metal interface. For instance, the morphology and stability of Pd films on Pt(1 1 1) were examined using in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and FTIR measurements, revealing that electrochemically deposited films are pseudomorphic, occupying commensurate Pt sites to maintain the ABC stacking of the Pt(1 1 1) substrate.

        The comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research is achieved through a combination of experiments and theoretical predictions. This includes the use of various spectroscopic techniques like AES, LEED, LEIS, XPS, and STM to determine the surface composition and structure, as well as the influence of subsurface Ni atoms on the electronic structure of the surface Pt atoms, leading to weaker metal-adsorbate bonds.

        In summary, the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is pivotal for advanced surface science and catalysis research, enabling detailed insights into their structure, electronic properties, and chemical behavior under various conditions. This knowledge is essential for optimizing catalyst performance and developing new materials with enhanced functionalities.

        The characterization also delves into the properties of thin transition metal films supported on Pt(hkl) and Au(hkl) surfaces, aiming to establish a link between physical properties and electrocatalytic activity. For instance, the morphology and stability of Pd films on Pt(1 1 1) are examined through in-situ surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) measurements, revealing the pseudomorphic nature of these films and their commensurate occupancy on Pt sites.

        The process is further enriched by understanding the influence of annealing on the surface properties, as seen in the changes in the intensities of surface peaks and shifts in binding energies, which can indicate diffusion of elements and changes in the alloy structure. After annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp, indicating the formation of a more ordered surface structure.

        The characterization process also involves studying the adsorption of CO on Ce/Pt(111) surfaces using techniques like LEED, XPS, and temperature-programmed desorption, providing insights into the surface chemistry and reactivity.

        This detailed characterization is crucial for understanding the behavior of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces under various conditions, enabling the development of advanced catalysts and materials with tailored properties for specific applications in surface science and catalysis research.

Comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces: synthesis methods, structural modeling, and its critical role in understanding the electronic and chemical properties for advanced surface science and catalysis research involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It utilizes synchrotron radiation, specifically the SA73b beamline with a TGM7 monochromator, for experiments conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with a hemispherical analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are obtained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV, 8 μA cm−) followed by annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The growth process up to 2 ML reveals the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy, characterized by a bulk-like peak (B*) at 71.0 ± 0.03 eV and a surface-like peak (S*) at 70.6 ± 0.03 eV. The relative variation of the intensity is +10%. Annealing affects the alloy structure, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. After annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 × 2) with low background intensities.

        The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves conducting the formation of a specific surface alloy. This process is crucial for structural modeling, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the detailed structural insights gained from synchrotron-based spectroscopies to optimize the synthesis conditions for Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This could involve tailoring the deposition rate, substrate temperature, or the nature of the initial monolayer to achieve desired electronic configurations. Additionally, there is potential to delve deeper into the role of interface states at the Ni/Pt boundary, which significantly influence the electronic structure and reactivity. By systematically varying these parameters and studying the resulting changes in electronic properties, researchers could uncover new pathways for enhancing the catalytic performance of these surfaces. Moreover, integrating machine learning algorithms with structural databases could predict the optimal composition and morphology of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces for specific catalytic tasks, paving the way for the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts. Future work may also benefit from the integration of in situ techniques with ex situ characterization methods to gain real-time insights into the dynamic evolution of surface properties during catalytic reactions.
