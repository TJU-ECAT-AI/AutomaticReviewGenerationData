Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1016/s0039-6028(96)01527-0\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1103/physrevb.57.r4285\] and \[10.1103/physrevb.59.15935\]. Comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It utilizes synchrotron radiation, specifically the SA73b beamline with a TGM7 monochromator, for experiments conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with various spectroscopic tools. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are prepared through a series of cycles of argon-ion sputtering and annealing. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line is studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction, revealing the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy characterized by distinct peaks at certain binding energies. Annealing affects the alloy structure, leading to changes in the intensities and positions of these peaks. The characterization also encompasses the investigation of surface segregation and defect-induced surface properties, contributing to a deeper understanding of the behavior of these bimetallic surfaces under various conditions.

Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1103/physrevb.57.r4285\] and \[10.1103/physrevb.59.15935\]. Comprehensive characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces: synthesis methods, structural modeling, and its critical role in understanding the electronic and chemical properties for advanced surface science and catalysis research involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It utilizes synchrotron radiation, specifically the SA73b beamline with a TGM7 monochromator, for experiments conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with a hemispherical analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are obtained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV, 8 μA cm−) followed by annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The growth process up to 2 ML reveals the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy, characterized by a bulk-like peak (B*) at 71.0 ± 0.03 eV and a surface-like peak (S*) at 70.6 ± 0.03 eV. The relative variation of the intensity is +10%. Annealing affects the alloy structure, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. After annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 × 2) with low background intensities.

        The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves conducting the formation of a specific surface alloy. This process is crucial for structural modeling, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

        Integrative understanding and prospective outlook: Considering the advancements and findings discussed in the file, there lies an opportunity to explore emerging fields and innovative methodologies. Future research endeavors might focus on leveraging the detailed structural insights gained from synchrotron-based spectroscopies to optimize the synthesis conditions for Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces. This could involve tailoring the deposition rate, substrate temperature, or the nature of the initial monolayer to achieve desired electronic configurations. Additionally, there is potential to delve deeper into the role of interface states at the Ni/Pt boundary, which significantly influence the electronic structure and reactivity. By systematically varying these parameters and studying the resulting changes in electronic properties, researchers could uncover new pathways for enhancing the catalytic performance of these surfaces. Moreover, integrating machine learning algorithms with structural databases could predict the optimal composition and morphology of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces for specific catalytic tasks, paving the way for the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts. Future work may also benefit from the integration of in situ techniques with ex situ characterization methods to gain real-time insights into the dynamic evolution of surface properties during catalytic reactions. This would enable the identification of transient states that could lead to the discovery of novel reaction mechanisms and catalytic sites, ultimately driving the next generation of advanced surface science and catalysis technologies.
