        [1] "The experiments were carried out using synchrotron radiation at the SuperAco storage ring, Orsay, France. The beamline used was SA73b with a TGM7 monochromator. The experiments were performed in a stainless-steel UHV chamber. The system was equipped with a hemispherical analyser for PES, a cylindrical mirror analyser (CMA) for AES, and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu( 100) single-crystal surfaces were obtained by repeated cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV,8 μA cm-) and annealing at 850 K. To study the Pt 4f,,, photoemission line (bulk binding energy (BE) 7 1.15 eV), the photon energy was set to 150 eV using p-polarisation. Fig. 2a shows the decomposition of the spectra corresponding to 0.5-3 ML Pt deposition. Up to 2 ML we found the same pair of peaks,i.e. a bulk-like peak (labelled B*) at 71.0f0.03 eV, and a surface-like peak (labelled S*) at 70.6 +0.03 eV. The relative variation of the intensity is + 10%. The effects of annealing are two-fold: first, the inten- sities of B and S decrease, indicating that Pt diffuses into the Cu substrate, and second, the B and S peaks shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. After annealing, the LEED patterns became sharp c(2 x 2) with low background intensities."
