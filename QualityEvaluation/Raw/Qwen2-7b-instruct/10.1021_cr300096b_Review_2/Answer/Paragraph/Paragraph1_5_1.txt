        The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It utilizes synchrotron radiation, specifically the SA73b beamline with a TGM7 monochromator, for experiments conducted in a stainless-steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with a hemispherical analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), a cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and LEED apparatus. Clean Cu(100) single-crystal surfaces are obtained through cycles of argon-ion sputtering (600 eV, 8 μA cm−) followed by annealing at 850 K. The Pt 4f core-level photoemission line, with a bulk binding energy of 7 1.15 eV, is studied using 150 eV photons polarized in the p direction. The growth process up to 2 ML reveals the formation of an extended Pt-Cu surface alloy, characterized by a bulk-like peak (B*) at 71.0 ± 0.03 eV and a surface-like peak (S*) at 70.6 ± 0.03 eV. The relative variation of the intensity is +10%. Annealing affects the alloy structure, causing the intensities of B and S to decrease and the peaks to shift by 150 meV towards lower binding energy to the B* and S* positions, respectively. After annealing, the LEED patterns become sharp c(2 × 2) with low background intensities.
