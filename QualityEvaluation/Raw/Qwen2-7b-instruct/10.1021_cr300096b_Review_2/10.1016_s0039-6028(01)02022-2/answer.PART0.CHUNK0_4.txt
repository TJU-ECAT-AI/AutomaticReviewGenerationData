[1] "Recently, NiPt-based thin films and alloys have attracted considerable interest due to their magnetism and catalytic activity."
[2] "Ni atoms prefer to occupy the threefold hollow sites with fcc stacking sequence initially."
[3] "This incommensurate LEED structure indicates an incoherent epitaxy of Ni overlayers on Pt(1 1 1)."
[4] "Each experimental value was measured 3 min after the thermal equilibrium was reached."
[5] "Ta rises as the coverage of Ni increases."
[6] "It is interesting that Ta significantly increases when the coverage is larger than 2 ML."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) are used to study the growth and alloy formation. The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
