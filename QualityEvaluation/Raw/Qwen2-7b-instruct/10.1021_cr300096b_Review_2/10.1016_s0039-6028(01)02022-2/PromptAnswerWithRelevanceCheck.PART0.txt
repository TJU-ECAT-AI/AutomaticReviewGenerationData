[1] "The starting temperature for the alloy formation increases significantly as the Ni thin films turn into three-dimensional islands."
[2] "This phenomenon may be caused by the adsorbateadsorbate interaction. This interaction prevents the formation of NiPt alloy. Since the interdiffusion occurs from the NiPt interface, the attraction between Ni atoms needs to be overcome by higher temperature."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It allows researchers to observe a range of structural phases at different coverage levels, including pseudo-(1×1) structures, commensurate superstructures, Ni(1×1) spots, incoherent epitaxy, and (2×2) superstructures. The study of alloy formation, particularly the starting temperatures for the NiPt alloy development, provides insights into the interdiffusion barriers and the role of adsorbate interactions in preventing alloy formation. Understanding these processes is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research.

[1] "The growth of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) follows the layer-by-layer growth mode up to 2 ML, then it turns into the 3-D island growth mode."
[2] "The starting temperatures for NiPt alloy formation are 450, 475, 500, 600, and 650 K for Ni coverage of 0.8, 1.3, 2.0, 2.3, and 3.0 ML, respectively."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through the use of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These techniques allow for the detailed examination of the initial growth and the alloy formation of Ni ultrathin films on the Pt(111) surface. The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and the comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The characterization provides insights into the various structural phases observed at different coverage levels, including pseudo-(1×1) structures, coherent epitaxy, incoherent epitaxy, and (2×2) superstructures. Additionally, the study reveals the starting temperatures for the formation of NiPt alloys, which vary depending on the Ni coverage on the Pt(111) surface.
