1. NiPt-based thin films and alloys are of great interest due to their unique magnetic properties and catalytic activity in various technological applications.

2. The initial adsorption of Ni atoms tends to occupy the threefold hollow sites with face-centered cubic (fcc) stacking sequence on the surface.

3. This observation aligns with the theoretical predictions and experimental findings.

4. The most pronounced satellite LEED pattern is observed in the Ni coverages ranging from 1.3 to 2.0 ML.

5. The incommensurate LEED structure suggests an incoherent epitaxial growth of Ni layers on the Pt(1 1 1) surface.

6. The behavior of the starting temperature (Ta) for NiPt alloy formation is similar to that observed in Co/Pt(1 1 1) systems.

7. As the Ni coverage exceeds 2 ML, the starting temperature for NiPt alloy formation experiences a significant increase.

1. NiPt基薄膜和合金因其独特的磁性和催化活性而在各种技术应用中受到极大关注。

2. Ni原子倾向于占据表面的三重空位，并以面心立方（fcc）堆叠序列排列。

3. 这一观察结果与理论预测和实验发现一致。

4. 最明显的卫星LEED模式在Ni覆盖范围为1.3至2.0 ML时出现。

5. 不相容的LEED结构表明Ni层在Pt(1 1 1)表面上的非晶质外延生长。

6. NiPt合金形成开始温度（Ta）的行为类似于Co/Pt(1 1 1)系统中的行为。

7. 当Ni覆盖超过2 ML时，NiPt合金形成开始温度经历显著增加。
