[1] "Recently, NiPt-based thin films and alloys have attracted considerable interest due to their magnetism and catalytic activity."
[2] "The Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) substrate has a tendency of large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at low temperatures."
[3] "Adding Ni atoms on CoPt thin films or multilayers can decrease the Curie temperature and lead to some interesting changes in magnetic properties."
[4] "The study of growth behavior and alloy formation of Ni films on Pt is conducive to the understanding of their magnetic properties and catalytic activities."
[5] "In this report, low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were used to study the initial growth of Ni ultrathin films deposited on a Pt(1 1 1) surface."
[6] "The growth of Ni ultrathin films on Pt(1 1 1) follows the layer-by-layer growth mode up to 2 ML, then it turns into the 3-D island growth mode."
[7] "A rich variety of structural phases in this system were observed at different coverage: the pseudo-(1×1) structure for Θ<0.2 ML, the commensurate superstructure for 0.3Θ0.9 ML, the Ni(1×1) spots appearing outside of Pt(1×1) LEED spots for 1.0Θ1.2 ML, the incoherent epitaxy for 1.3Θ6.0 ML, and the (2×2) superstructure for 6.0Θ10 ML."
[8] "The starting temperatures for NiPt alloy formation are 450, 475, 500, 600, and 650 K for Ni coverage of 0.8, 1.3, 2.0, 2.3, and 3.0 ML, respectively."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates using methods like molecular beam epitaxy. Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) are employed to analyze the initial growth and alloy formation. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The layer-by-layer growth mode is observed up to 2 ML, followed by 3-D island growth. A variety of structural phases emerge at different coverage levels, including pseudo-(1×1), coherent epitaxy, incoherent epitaxy, and (2×2) superstructures. The starting temperatures for NiPt alloy formation increase significantly as the Ni thin film coverage exceeds 2 ML.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层，使用分子束外延等方法。低能电子衍射（LEED）和俄歇电子能谱（AES）被用来分析初始生长和合金形成。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及深入了解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下。在2 ML之前观察到层状生长模式，随后转变为三维岛状生长。在不同的覆盖率下，出现了一系列结构相，包括伪-(1×1)、共轭超结构、不相干异质核化以及(2×2)超结构。NiPt合金形成的起始温度显著增加，当Ni薄膜覆盖超过2 ML时。
