The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to control the surface composition and structure precisely. This precision enables a detailed understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The AES measurements determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time, providing insights into the stability and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces under various conditions. Lower temperature experiments are conducted to accurately estimate the activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms, contributing to the overall understanding of the structural transformations and their implications for the activity in the cathode ORR reactions.

1. The surface preparation included cleaning the Pt(111) surface with Ne+ sputtering at 500 K, followed by O2 treatment at 600 K, and finally annealing at 1100 K. A monolayer of Ni or Co was deposited onto the Pt(111) surface.
2. The aim of the experiments was to determine the temperature at which Ni starts to segregate from the subsurface to the surface under oxidizing conditions.
3. The inward diffusion of Co was found to be significantly more pronounced than that of Ni at comparable temperatures.
4. The AES data indicated that Co undergoes both outward segregation and inward diffusion in Co/Pt surfaces, which could preserve a portion of the PtCoPt subsurface structure and thus maintain enhanced ORR activity compared to pure Pt in an oxygen-containing cathode environment.

1. 表面处理包括使用Ne+溅射在500 K下清洗Pt(111)表面，然后在600 K下进行O2处理，并最终在1100 K下退火。在Pt(111)表面沉积了一层单分子层的Ni或Co。
2. 实验的目的是确定在氧化性条件下Ni开始从亚表面向表面扩散的温度。
3. 研究发现，在相似的温度下，Co的内向扩散远比Ni更为显著。
4. AES数据表明，在Co/Pt表面中，Co同时发生向外扩散和内向扩散，这可能会保留一部分PtCoPt亚表面结构，并因此在氧含量较高的阴极环境中保持增强的ORR活性，与纯Pt相比。

<p>The surface compositions of Ni/Pt(111) and Co/Pt(111) were monitored by using the Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios, respectively.</p>
<p>After accounting for differences in the inelastic mean free paths of the electrons, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors, our research group had previously estimated the onset of a monolayer at 600 K to be at Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 [32] and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0.27</p>
<p>For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K as the NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures and the 600 K surfaces as the PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures.</p>

To characterize Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, the researchers monitor the surface compositions using Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) Auger ratios. These ratios are adjusted for variations in electron inelastic mean free paths, atomic radii, and Auger sensitivity factors. Based on these adjustments, the researchers estimate that the onset of a monolayer at 600 K corresponds to Auger ratios of Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 1.0 and Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) 2.0. Therefore, the freshly deposited Ni/Pt or Co/Pt surfaces at 300 K are referred to as NiPtPt(111) or CoPtPt(111) surface structures, while the 600 K surfaces are designated as PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) subsurface structures.

为了表征通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层制备的Ni/Pt双金属表面，研究者通过监测Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)和Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV)俄歇比来监控表面组成。根据电子非弹性平均自由路径、原子半径和俄歇灵敏度因子的变化对这些比率进行调整。基于这些调整，研究者估计在600 K时，Ni(849 eV)/Pt(241 eV)的俄歇比为1.0和Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV)的俄歇比为2.0时，单层的开始出现。因此，300 K时沉积的Ni/Pt或Co/Pt表面被称作NiPtPt(111)或CoPtPt(111)表面结构，而600 K时的表面则被标记为PtNiPt(111)或PtCoPt(111)亚表面结构。

<p>The surface was then heated to the next temperature and exposed to another 200 L of O2 without any surface cleaning. After oxygen exposures at 300 and 400 K, two vibrational features are present at 453 and 2070 cm-1, which are assigned to ν(PtO) and ν(CO) (background contamination), respectively.</p>
<p>After exposing the PtCoPt(111) surface to 200 L O2 at 100 K, the HREEL spectrum is different from that on clean Pt(111). The 100 K spectrum is characterized by the υ(PtO) peak at 467 cm-1. However, even at such a low temperature, a second peak is detected at 521 cm-1, suggesting the presence of additional adsorption sites due to the modification of Pt(111) by Co, even at 100 K. As the temperature is increased to 300 K, the υ(PtO) mode disappears and CoO vibrational modes are detected at 359 and 548 cm-1.</p>
<p>For the Ni/Pt(111) experiments, the y-axis in Figure 7a is calibrated with values of 1 and 0 being equivalent to Ni/Pt Auger ratios of approximately 1.7 (1 ML surface Ni at 600 K) and 1.0 (after heating to 600 K), respectively.</p>
<p>Similar to the procedure used for the Ni/Pt(111) experiments, the y-axis in Figure 8a is calibrated with values of 1 and 0 being equivalent to Co/Pt Auger ratios of approximately 2.8 (1 ML surface Co at 300 K) and 2.0 (after heating to 600 K), respectively.</p>
<p>The general equation for temperature-dependent segregation can expressed as:</p>
<p><img src="equation.png"></p>
<p>Through the use of similar analysis procedures described for PtNiPt, the Ea value is estimated to be between 7  1 kcal/mol for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms at the temperature regime of 300350 K.</p>

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition allows for the creation of a PtNiPt(111) or PtCoPt(111) surface structure, which can then be subjected to various experimental techniques to analyze its properties. The use of single crystal substrates ensures homogeneity, while polycrystalline substrates might introduce additional complexities related to grain boundaries. The deposition process is essential for creating a controlled environment to study the interactions between Pt and the 3d metal, such as Ni or Co, under different conditions.

To understand the electronic and chemical properties, the surface is often exposed to oxygen and then characterized using techniques like HREELS and AES. The HREELS technique identifies vibrational modes that can indicate the segregation of Ni or Co atoms from the subsurface to the surface. AES measurements determine the change in the surface composition over time, which helps in estimating the activation barrier for the segregation process. The activation barrier provides insights into the stability and reactivity of the bimetallic surface in the presence of oxygen, which is critical for the development of efficient electrocatalysts for applications like fuel cells.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。通过沉积过程，可以创建PtNiPt（111）或PtCoPt（111）表面结构，然后使用各种实验技术来分析其性质。单晶基板确保了均一性，而多晶基板可能会引入与晶粒边界相关的复杂性。沉积过程对于创造在不同条件下研究Pt与3d金属（如Ni或Co）之间相互作用的可控环境至关重要。

为了理解电子和化学性质，表面通常被暴露于氧气并随后使用技术如HREELS和AES进行表征。HREELS技术可以识别出指示Ni或Co原子从亚表面向表面迁移的振动模式。AES测量确定了表面组成随时间的变化，这有助于估算分离过程中的活化能垒。活化能垒提供了在氧气存在下表面稳定性和反应性的信息，这对于开发高效电催化剂，例如燃料电池应用，至关重要。
