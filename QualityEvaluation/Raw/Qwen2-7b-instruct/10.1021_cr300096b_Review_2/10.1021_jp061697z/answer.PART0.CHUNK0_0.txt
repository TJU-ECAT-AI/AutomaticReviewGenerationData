The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to control the surface composition and structure precisely. This precision enables a detailed understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The AES measurements determine the increase in the surface Ni/Pt ratio as a function of oxygen exposure time, providing insights into the stability and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces under various conditions. Lower temperature experiments are conducted to accurately estimate the activation barrier for the segregation of subsurface Co atoms, contributing to the overall understanding of the structural transformations and their implications for the activity in the cathode ORR reactions.
