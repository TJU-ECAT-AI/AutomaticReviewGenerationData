[1] "The surface preparation involved cleaning the Pt(111) surface with Ne+ sputtering at 500 K and with O2 treatment at 600 K, followed by annealing at 1100 K. Monolayer coverage of Ni or Co was deposited onto Pt(111) from an evaporative doser."
[2] "The purpose of these experiments was to identify the onset temperature for the segregation of Ni atoms from the subsurface to the surface under oxidizing conditions."
[3] "The AES results in Figure 4 show that the inward diffusion of Co is much more extensive than that of Ni at similar temperatures."
[4] "The AES results also suggest that the outward segregation and inward diffusion of Co atoms are coexistent in the Co/Pt surfaces, which should maintain some PtCoPt subsurface structures that are more active than Pt for ORR in the oxygen-containing cathode environment."

1. The surface preparation included cleaning the Pt(111) surface with Ne+ sputtering at 500 K, followed by O2 treatment at 600 K, and finally annealing at 1100 K. A monolayer of Ni or Co was deposited onto the Pt(111) surface.
2. The aim of the experiments was to determine the temperature at which Ni starts to segregate from the subsurface to the surface under oxidizing conditions.
3. The inward diffusion of Co was found to be significantly more pronounced than that of Ni at comparable temperatures.
4. The AES data indicated that Co undergoes both outward segregation and inward diffusion in Co/Pt surfaces, which could preserve a portion of the PtCoPt subsurface structure and thus maintain enhanced ORR activity compared to pure Pt in an oxygen-containing cathode environment.

1. 表面处理包括使用Ne+溅射在500 K下清洗Pt(111)表面，然后在600 K下进行O2处理，并最终在1100 K下退火。在Pt(111)表面沉积了一层单分子层的Ni或Co。
2. 实验的目的是确定在氧化性条件下Ni开始从亚表面向表面扩散的温度。
3. 研究发现，在相似的温度下，Co的内向扩散远比Ni更为显著。
4. AES数据表明，在Co/Pt表面中，Co同时发生向外扩散和内向扩散，这可能会保留一部分PtCoPt亚表面结构，并因此在氧含量较高的阴极环境中保持增强的ORR活性，与纯Pt相比。
