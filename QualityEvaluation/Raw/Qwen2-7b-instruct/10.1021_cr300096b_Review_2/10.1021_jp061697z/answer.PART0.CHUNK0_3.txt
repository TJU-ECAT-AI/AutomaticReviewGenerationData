[1] "The surface preparation included cleaning the single-crystal sample with Ne+ sputtering at 500 K and then with O2 treatment at 600 K, followed by annealing at 1100 K. Surface contaminants were removed."
[2] "Monolayer coverage of Ni or Co was deposited onto Pt(111) from an evaporative doser, consisting of high-purity Ni or Co wire wrapped around a tungsten filament."
[3] "The bimetallic structures with surface monolayer of Ni or Co were prepared with the Pt(111) crystal temperature maintained at 300 K; the subsurface PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) structures were obtained by heating to 600 K based on conditions developed in our previous studies."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involved depositing a monolayer of Ni or Co onto a Pt(111) single crystal surface at 300 K. The subsurface PtNiPt(111) and PtCoPt(111) structures were then formed by heating the samples to 600 K. This process was crucial for studying the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, especially in relation to their catalytic activities and stability in oxygen environments.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征包括在300 K下将一层Ni或Co沉积到单晶Pt(111)表面上。然后通过加热到600 K形成深层PtNiPt(111)和PtCoPt(111)结构。这一过程对于研究这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，特别是它们在氧气环境下的催化活性和稳定性。
