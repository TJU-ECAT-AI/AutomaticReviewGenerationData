<p>In order to confirm that the onset of the self-hydrogenation pathway is due to the interaction of surface Pt atoms with subsurface Ni atoms, similar TPD measurements were performed on Pt-modified Ni(111) at various Pt coverages, as shown in Fig. 38 (b) [78].</p>
<p>The weaker binding energy of cyclohexene on the subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure is confirmed by DFT calculations [140], as shown in Fig. 40.</p>
<p>The observation of weakly bonded alkenes and atomic H suggests that the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structures should be more active toward the hydrogenation of alkenes.</p>
<p>These DFT predictions are confirmed experimentally using TPD and HREELS measurements. Fig. 45 shows the TPD results of the hydrogenation products, 2-propenol (CH2=CHCH2OH) from the hydrogenation of the C=O bond and propanal (CH3CH2CH=O) from the hydrogenation of the C=C bond [143].</p>
<p>Similar to the volcano type of relationship mentioned for the hydrogenation activity as a function of d-band center, one should also expect similar type of volcano behavior for the reforming yield.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates involves TPD measurements and DFT calculations. These techniques are crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. TPD measurements help confirm the interaction patterns and reactivity of the surfaces, while DFT calculations provide insights into the binding energies of adsorbates, facilitating the prediction of surface activities and selectivities. The process enables researchers to identify surfaces with desired properties for specific applications, such as enhanced hydrogenation or reforming activities.
