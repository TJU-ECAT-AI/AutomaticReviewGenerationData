[1] "The formation of bimetallic surfaces can be studied using techniques such as high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HRXPS), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). These methods provide information about the composition, structure, and bonding characteristics of the surfaces."

[2] "These experimental characterizations are crucial for understanding the electronic properties of the surfaces, which can be further modeled using density functional theory (DFT)."

[3] "The electronic properties of the surfaces, such as the position of the d-band center, are key factors affecting the adsorption energies of various molecules. This information is essential for predicting the reactivity of the surfaces in catalytic reactions."

对通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，通常采用高分辨率X射线光电子能谱（HRXPS）、高分辨率电子能量损失谱（HREELS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）等技术。这些方法提供了关于表面组成、结构和键合特性的信息。这些实验表征对于理解表面的电子性质至关重要，这些性质可以进一步通过密度泛函理论（DFT）进行建模。表面的电子性质，特别是d带中心的位置，显著影响各种分子的吸附能。这些信息对于预测催化反应中表面的活性非常重要。
