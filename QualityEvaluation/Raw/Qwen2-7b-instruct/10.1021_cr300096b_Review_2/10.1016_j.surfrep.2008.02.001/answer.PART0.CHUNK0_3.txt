[1] "The Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling [26] ."
[2] "When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure."
[3] "If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure."
[4] "For example, Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K."
[5] "In the normal emission experiment, the sample surface was normal to the analyzer and the X-ray beam was incident on the surface at an angle approximately 6070 from the surface normal."
[6] "At 600 K ( Fig. 6 (b)), the grazing to normal intensity ratio was 0.74, suggesting a more isotropic composition of the near-surface region, consistent with the inward diffusion of surface Ni atoms at 600 K."
[7] "Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K."
[8] "In addition to the examples given above, many UHV techniques have been utilized to study the physical and chemical properties of a wide range of MBS systems."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) involves utilizing a variety of experimental techniques such as Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and Density Functional Theory (DFT modeling). These methods are crucial for understanding the structural, electronic, and chemical properties of these surfaces, particularly in the context of catalysis research. The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces can result in either a surface monolayer (NiPt(111)) or a subsurface monolayer (PtNiPt(111)) structure depending on the deposition temperature. AES and XPS techniques are used to differentiate between these two structures. LEIS and LEED are employed to study the chemical properties of the surfaces, while STM provides insights into the morphology. DFT modeling helps predict the electronic properties, such as the surface d-band center, which is related to the adsorption energies of various molecules. The combination of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations offers a comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surfaces' behavior in catalytic applications.

对通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，使用了多种实验技术，如Auger电子能谱(AES)，X射线光电子能谱(XPS)，低能离子散射(LEIS)，低能电子衍射(LEED)，扫描隧道显微镜(STM)和密度泛函理论(DFT建模)。这些方法对于理解这些表面的结构、电子和化学性质至关重要，特别是在催化研究的背景下。Ni/Pt双金属表面的合成可以产生表面单层(NiPt(111))或亚表面单层(PtNiPt(111))结构，具体取决于沉积温度。AES和XPS技术用于区分这两种结构。LEIS和LEED用于研究表面的化学性质，而STM提供了关于形态的见解。DFT建模有助于预测电子性质，如表面d带中心，这与各种分子的吸附能有关。实验技术和理论计算的结合为理解双金属表面在催化应用中的行为提供了全面的理解。
