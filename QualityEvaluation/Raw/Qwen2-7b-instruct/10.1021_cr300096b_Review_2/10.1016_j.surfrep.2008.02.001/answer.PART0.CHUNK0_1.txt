[1] "When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure."

[2] "For example, Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K."

[3] "The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves the use of various experimental techniques such as Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. 

First, AES and XPS are used to differentiate between the surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures by analyzing the intensity curves and calibration curves. This helps in understanding the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer, whether it's layer-by-layer or forming 3D islands. 

LEIS spectroscopy is more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer, providing a clear distinction between surface and subsurface structures. LEED is used to determine the overlayer structure and confirm the epitaxial growth of the metal overlayers.

STM is utilized to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer, showing whether Ni atoms form islands or nucleate at the step edges. 

DFT calculations are crucial for understanding the electronic properties, such as the surface d-band center, which correlates with the adsorption energies of various adsorbates. This aids in predicting the chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of their behavior in catalysis and surface science.

This process is essential for synthesizing bimetallic surfaces with desired chemical properties, predicting their behavior in catalytic reactions, and advancing the field of surface science.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及使用多种实验技术，如低能离子散射（LEIS）、俄歇电子能谱（AES）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、低能电子衍射（LEED）、扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算。首先，通过AES和XPS分析强度曲线和校准曲线来区分表面单层结构和亚表面单层结构，这有助于理解金属覆盖层的生长机制，是层状还是形成三维岛状。LEIS光谱在检测表面最顶层元素组成方面更为敏感，能够清晰地区分表面和亚表面结构。LEED用于确定覆盖层结构并确认单晶表面的层状生长。

STM被用来确定金属覆盖层的结构和形态，显示Ni原子是否形成岛屿或在台阶边缘核化。DFT计算对于理解电子性质至关重要，例如表面d带中心，这与各种吸附剂的吸附能有关。这有助于预测双金属表面的化学性质，从而促进表面科学和催化领域的深入理解。

这个过程对于合成具有所需化学性质的双金属表面、预测催化反应行为以及推进表面科学领域的发展至关重要。
