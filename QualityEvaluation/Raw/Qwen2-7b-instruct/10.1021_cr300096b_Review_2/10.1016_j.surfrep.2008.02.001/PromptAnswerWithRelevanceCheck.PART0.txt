The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is typically conducted using a variety of surface science techniques, such as high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HRXPS), high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED). These techniques provide detailed information about the elemental composition, bonding environment, and structural arrangement of the bimetallic layers. 

The process is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Structural Modeling**: Accurate knowledge of the surface structure is essential for constructing realistic models of the bimetallic surfaces. This includes understanding the precise location of the Ni atoms on the Pt(111) surface, whether they are part of a monolayer or form a subsurface layer. This information is used in density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict electronic properties and reactivity.

2. **DFT Calculations**: DFT is a computational tool that relies heavily on accurate structural input. The precise geometry and coordination environment of the Ni atoms on the Pt surface influence the electronic structure and thus the calculated properties such as binding energies of adsorbates, electronic band structures, and reaction pathways. 

3. **Comprehensive Understanding**: By combining experimental techniques with theoretical calculations, researchers gain a deeper insight into the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces. This understanding is critical for the development of catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity for specific reactions, such as hydrogenation, reforming, and oxidation processes.

4. **Catalysis Research**: In the context of catalysis, the characterization of bimetallic surfaces helps in designing materials that can efficiently convert reactants into desired products. Understanding how the electronic properties of the surface influence reactivity is key to developing efficient and sustainable catalysts for industrial applications.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a series of experimental techniques including Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Low-energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Low-energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and other Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) techniques. These techniques are crucial for structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations because they allow us to determine the precise structure, composition, and electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. Understanding these properties is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research as they influence the catalytic activities of the surfaces.

Specifically, AES and XPS are sensitive to the elemental composition of the surface layers and can differentiate between layer-by-layer and 3D island growth modes. The calibration curves and equations, like Eq. (2.1), enable accurate determination of the monolayer coverage. LEIS spectroscopy is more sensitive to the topmost layer of the bimetallic surfaces, while LEED helps in identifying the overlayer structure. STM is useful for mapping the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer, providing insights into the growth mechanism and surface properties. UHV techniques are versatile and can be applied to a wide range of MBS systems to explore their physical and chemical properties comprehensively.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves the use of various experimental techniques such as Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. 

First, AES and XPS are used to differentiate between the surface monolayer and subsurface monolayer structures by analyzing the intensity curves and calibration curves. This helps in understanding the growth mechanism of the metal overlayer, whether it's layer-by-layer or forming 3D islands. 

LEIS spectroscopy is more sensitive in detecting the elemental composition of the topmost layer, providing a clear distinction between surface and subsurface structures. LEED is used to determine the overlayer structure and confirm the epitaxial growth of the metal overlayers.

STM is utilized to determine the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer, showing whether Ni atoms form islands or nucleate at the step edges. 

DFT calculations are crucial for understanding the electronic properties, such as the surface d-band center, which correlates with the adsorption energies of various adsorbates. This aids in predicting the chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of their behavior in catalysis and surface science.

This process is essential for synthesizing bimetallic surfaces with desired chemical properties, predicting their behavior in catalytic reactions, and advancing the field of surface science.

[2] "For example, Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K."

[3] "The AES, LEIS, XPS and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following the annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from the DFT modeling and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves the synthesis of a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates at specific temperatures to produce the NiPt(111) surface monolayer or the PtNiPt(111) subsurface monolayer. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to systematically vary the bimetallic structure, which influences the electronic and chemical properties of the surfaces. The use of techniques such as LEIS, AES, XPS, and STM helps in understanding the composition and structure of the surfaces, providing insights into the bonding interactions and reactivity of these surfaces in catalysis and surface science applications.
