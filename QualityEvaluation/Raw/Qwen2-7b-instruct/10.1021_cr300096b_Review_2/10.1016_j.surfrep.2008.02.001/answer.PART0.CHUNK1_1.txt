[1] "After identifying whether the particular reaction requires weakly or strongly bonded adsorbates, we should be able to quickly identify potential bimetallic combinations and surface structures (surface vs. subsurface monolayer) that are potentially better than the parent metals, based on the extensive database of values of HBE, OBE, and the direction and magnitude of d-band center shift of the MBS structures with respect to those of the parent metals."
[2] "For this reason many of the elegant examples of reactions on bimetallic surfaces, such as the pyramidal monolayer surfaces by Madey and coworkers [9], and the Sn/Pt surfaces by Koel and coworkers [17], just to name a few, will not be covered in this review."
[3] "In order to confirm the unusual TPD results, Fruhberger et al. [137] performed vibrational studies of ethylene on the three surfaces."
[4] "The weaker interaction of ethylene on PtNiPt(111), as compared to either Pt(111) or Ni(111), was confirmed by DFT calculations of ethylene binding energy on these surfaces [139]."

1. Based on the extensive database of values of HBE, OBE, and the direction and magnitude of d-band center shift, one can quickly identify bimetallic combinations and surface structures (surface vs. subsurface monolayer) that are potentially better than the parent metals for specific reactions, as these factors influence the strength of bonding between adsorbates and surfaces.

2. This review focuses on discussing the majority of examples of reactions on bimetallic surfaces, such as the pyramidal monolayer surfaces by Madey and coworkers [9], and the Sn/Pt surfaces by Koel and coworkers [17], but does not delve into them.

3. To validate the exceptional TPD findings, Fruhberger et al. [137] carried out vibrational analyses of ethylene on the involved surfaces.

4. The less interaction of ethylene on PtNiPt(111) compared to Pt(111) or Ni(111) was substantiated by DFT calculations assessing the ethylene binding energy on these surfaces [139].

1. 基于HBE、OBE以及MBS结构与母金属相比d能带中心偏移的方向和幅度的广泛数据库，可以快速识别出可能比母金属更好的二元合金组合和表面结构（表面vs.亚表面单层），这些因素影响吸附剂与表面之间的结合强度。

2. 此次审查主要关注讨论了许多关于二元合金表面反应的例子，如Madey及其同事的金字塔形单层表面[9]，以及Koel及其同事的Sn/Pt表面[17]，但并未详细涉及它们。

3. 为了验证异常的TPD结果，Fruhberger等[137]对三种表面进行了乙烯的振动分析。

4. 通过计算这些表面上的乙烷结合能，证实了乙烷在PtNiPt(111)上的较弱相互作用与Pt(111)或Ni(111)相比[139]。
