The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a series of experimental techniques including Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Low-energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), Low-energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and other Ultra-High Vacuum (UHV) techniques. These techniques are crucial for structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations because they allow us to determine the precise structure, composition, and electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces. Understanding these properties is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research as they influence the catalytic activities of the surfaces.

Specifically, AES and XPS are sensitive to the elemental composition of the surface layers and can differentiate between layer-by-layer and 3D island growth modes. The calibration curves and equations, like Eq. (2.1), enable accurate determination of the monolayer coverage. LEIS spectroscopy is more sensitive to the topmost layer of the bimetallic surfaces, while LEED helps in identifying the overlayer structure. STM is useful for mapping the structure and morphology of the metal overlayer, providing insights into the growth mechanism and surface properties. UHV techniques are versatile and can be applied to a wide range of MBS systems to explore their physical and chemical properties comprehensively.

对通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，使用了一系列实验技术，包括Auger电子能谱(AES)，X射线光电子能谱(XPS)，低能量离子散射(LEIS)，低能量电子衍射(LEED)，扫描隧道显微镜(STM)以及其他超高压真空(UHV)技术。这些技术对于结构建模和密度泛函理论(DFT)计算至关重要，因为它们允许我们确定双金属表面的精确结构、组成和电子性质。理解这些性质对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它们影响表面的催化活性。

具体而言，AES和XPS对表面层的元素组成敏感，并可以区分层状生长和三维岛状生长模式。校准曲线和方程，如方程(2.1)，能够准确确定单层覆盖度。LEIS光谱技术更敏感于双金属表面的顶层，而LEED有助于识别过层结构。STM对于映射金属过层的结构和形态非常有用，提供了关于生长机制和表面性质的见解。UHV技术具有灵活性，并可以应用于各种MBS系统以全面探索它们的物理和化学性质。
