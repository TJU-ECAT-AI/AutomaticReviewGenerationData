[1] "When Ni is deposited with the Pt(111) surface held at 300 K, Ni atoms stay on the topmost layer to produce the NiPt(111) surface MBS structure. If this surface is subsequently heated to 600 K, or if the monolayer deposition occurs with the Pt(111) substrate held at 600 K, most of the Ni atoms diffuse into the subsurface region to produce the PtNiPt(111) subsurface MBS structure."
[2] "For example, Fig. 5 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPt(111) surface to 900 K. For the LEIS experiments ( Fig. 5 (a)), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was approximately 1 ML. The LEIS analyser was fixed at an energy corresponding to He+ scattering from either Ni or Pt, while the sample was heated continuously at a linear rate of approximately 9 K /s."
[3] "The surface sensitivity of the LEIS technique makes it one of the most sensitive techniques in the differentiation of surface and subsurface MBS structures,"
[4] "The Ni /Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces have been characterized using a wide range of experimental techniques and DFT modeling [26]."
[5] "The formation of the hetero-atom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface, giving rise to modifications of its electronic structure through the ligand effect. Second, the geometry of the bimetallic structure is typically different from that of the parent metals, e.g. the average metal-metal bond lengths change. This gives rise to the strain effect that is known to modify the electronic structure of the metal through changes in orbital overlap."

1. The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. Depending on the deposition conditions, the resulting structures can be either surface monolayer NiPt(111) or subsurface monolayer PtNiPt(111).

2. The characterization of these surfaces employs various techniques including Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). These methods are crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations, helping to understand the electronic and chemical properties of the surfaces.

3. The LEIS technique is particularly sensitive to distinguishing between surface and subsurface MBS structures due to its surface sensitivity.

4. A wide range of experimental techniques and Density Functional Theory (DFT) modeling have been used to study the properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.

5. The electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces are influenced by two key factors: the ligand effect, which modifies the electronic environment due to hetero-atom bonding, and the strain effect, which arises from the differences in average metal-metal bond lengths compared to the parent metals.
