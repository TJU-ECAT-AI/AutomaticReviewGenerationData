The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates involves both experimental and computational methods. Kitchin et al. have used density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of the segregation of 3d metals in the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface MBS structures. Additionally, they have employed experimental techniques such as AES measurements to estimate the activation barriers for the segregation of subsurface Ni and Co atoms. These methods are crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as they provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, which are essential for understanding their behavior in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

对通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，涉及实验和计算方法。Kitchin等人的研究使用了密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来研究3d金属在Pt-3d-Pt(111)亚表面MBS结构中的相分离的热力学和动力学。此外，他们还采用了AES测量等实验技术来估算亚表面Ni和Co原子的相分离激活能垒。这些方法对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它们提供了有关双金属表面的电子和化学性质的见解，这对于理解其在先进表面科学和催化研究中的行为至关重要。
