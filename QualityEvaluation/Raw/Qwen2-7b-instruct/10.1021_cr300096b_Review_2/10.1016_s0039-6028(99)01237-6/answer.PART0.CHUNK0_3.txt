1. The electronic and structural properties of the LaPt(111) surface alloy were characterized using angle-resolved photoemission, core-level spectroscopy, and photoelectron diffraction. 
2. No alloy formation occurs below a lanthanum coverage of 0.5 monolayers (ML) during annealing. The lanthanum stays on the surface, evident through core-level spectroscopy.
3. The lanthanum atoms in the surface alloy were found to be positioned in sites with six-fold rotational symmetry, aligning with the CePt(111) surface alloy's structural model.
4. The surface alloy's band structure was found to be significantly different from that of Pt(111).
5. A surface-related state was identified in the Pt(111) band structure, not previously documented.
