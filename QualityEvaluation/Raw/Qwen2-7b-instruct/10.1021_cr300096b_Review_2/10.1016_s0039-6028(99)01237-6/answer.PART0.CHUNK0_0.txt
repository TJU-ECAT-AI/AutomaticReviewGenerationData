<p>For low lanthanum coverages (<0.5 monolayers (ML)) annealing of as-deposited films at 900 K produces no structural change in the surface, as witnessed by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and core-level spectroscopy. The k dispersion for such surfaces is very similar to the Pt(111) surface band structure.</p>
<p>Annealing of surfaces with higher lanthanum coverages (>1 ML) produces a surface alloy which displays a (2×2) LEED pattern. The k band structure for this alloy is changed dramatically compared with that of Pt(111).</p>
<p>Photoelectron diffraction shows that lanthanum is situated in sites with six-fold rotational symmetry in the surface alloy. For the platinum sites our data are inconclusive, but in accordance with a structural model proposed for the CePt(111) surface alloy based on the layered Pt5Ce compound.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
