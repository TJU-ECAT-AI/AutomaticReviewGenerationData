How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

<quotes>
<p>For low lanthanum coverages (<0.5 monolayers (ML)) annealing of as-deposited films at 900 K produces no structural change in the surface, as witnessed by low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and core-level spectroscopy. The k dispersion for such surfaces is very similar to the Pt(111) surface band structure.</p>
<p>Annealing of surfaces with higher lanthanum coverages (>1 ML) produces a surface alloy which displays a (2×2) LEED pattern. The k band structure for this alloy is changed dramatically compared with that of Pt(111).</p>
<p>Photoelectron diffraction shows that lanthanum is situated in sites with six-fold rotational symmetry in the surface alloy. For the platinum sites our data are inconclusive, but in accordance with a structural model proposed for the CePt(111) surface alloy based on the layered Pt5Ce compound.</p>

<p>The experiments reported in this paper were performed at beamline SA73 of the SuperACO storage ring at LURE in Orsay, France.</p>
<p>The Pt(111) crystal was cleaned by repeated cycles of 600 eV argon-ion sputtering and annealing in vacuum at 900 K.</p>
<p>Lanthanum was evaporated from a water-cooled source consisting of a resistively heated tungsten basket, which was thoroughly outgassed prior to use.</p>
<p>The lanthanum evaporation rate was determined by core-level intensity measurements by X-ray photoemission (XPS) in the home laboratory, where a near-constant photon flux could be obtained.</p>
<p>We have not observed distinct variations in measurements from different (2×2) alloys.</p>
<p>For the present measurements using synchrotron radiation, intensity measurements are more uncertain, and the coverage was estimated by monitoring the LEED pattern after annealing.</p>
<p>For low coverages LEED shows a (1×1) pattern after annealing. At high coverages a (2×2) LEED pattern is observed.</p>
<p>The recent work of Baddeley et al. [7] on the CePt(111) system showed the occurrence of relatively complicated structures.</p>
<p>It was argued that below this coverage no alloy formation takes place.</p>
<p>Immediately above this coverage annealing results in a LEED pattern similar to that found when annealing 0.5 ML Ce/Pt(111) at 1000 K [7].</p>
<p>On the other hand, a coverage of about 0.5 ML before annealing resulted in a relatively sharp (1×1) LEED pattern.</p>
<p>We have not observed distinct variations in measurements from different (2×2) alloys.</p>
<p>The criteria for a surface-related state are thus met; sensitivity to adsorption (oxygen in this case) and lack of dispersion normal to the surface.</p>
<p>There may be small variations in the 5p binding energy as a function of coverage for the as-deposited films, but when a (2×2) surface alloy is formed we always observe a shift of 0.40.5 eV.</p>
<p>The top curve in Fig. 4 shows the Pt 4f7/2 spectrum for an annealed lanthanum film where a (2×2) surface alloy has formed.</p>
<p>The energy position of this component is very close to that of bulk platinum, shifted only about 0.05 eV towards lower binding energy.</p>
<p>The detailed structure of the LaPt(111) surface alloy still remains to be determined.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The experimental setup includes using synchrotron radiation for measurements, employing techniques such as X-ray photoemission (XPS) for determining the evaporation rate of lanthanum, and analyzing the Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) patterns to determine the structure of the surface alloy. The core-level spectroscopy provides information on the distribution of elements on the surface, and photoelectron diffraction helps in identifying the symmetry of the atoms. The electronic structure of the surfaces is mapped using angle-resolved photoemission, revealing differences between the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces and pure Pt(111) surfaces. The detailed structure of the LaPt(111) surface alloy still remains to be determined.
