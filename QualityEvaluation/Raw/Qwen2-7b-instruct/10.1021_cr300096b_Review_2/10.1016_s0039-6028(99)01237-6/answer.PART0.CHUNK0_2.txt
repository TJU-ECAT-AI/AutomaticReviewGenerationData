[1] "The study of the LaPt(111) surface alloy is motivated from three different starting points. Our interest in this system has its origin in catalytic model systems."
[2] "Furthermore, it was found that the change in the CO-metal bond strength could not be explained by simple theory relating this to changes in the energy position of the d-band center."
[3] "These two surface alloys are found to have very similar electronic [3] ,[4] and geometric [5] ,[6] structures."
[4] "It was argued that below this coverage no alloy formation takes place."
[5] "We have not observed distinct variations in measurements from different (2×2) alloys."
[6] "In the work on the CePt(111) system, Baddeley et al. [7] concluded that significant CePt charge transfer occurs."
[7] "The absence of a surface core-level shift for platinum in the LaPt surface alloy indicates that platinum atoms on the surface are strongly affected by their lanthanum neighbors, and does not necessarily imply that there are no platinum atoms at the surface of the alloy."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the surfaces, which significantly impacts their properties. By understanding how the Ni and Pt layers interact and are arranged, scientists can better predict and optimize the performance of these materials in various applications, such as catalytic reactions.
