[1] "The study of the LaPt(111) surface alloy is motivated from three different starting points. Our interest in this system has its origin in catalytic model systems."
[2] "Furthermore, it was found that the change in the CO-metal bond strength could not be explained by simple theory relating this to changes in the energy position of the d-band center."
[3] "In what follows we present angular-resolved photoemission, mapping out the k dispersion of the Pt(111) and LaPt(111) surfaces."
[4] "It is found that below a certain lanthanum coverage, previously estimated to be 0.5 monolayers (ML), no alloy formation takes place upon annealing."
[5] "For the present measurements using synchrotron radiation, intensity measurements are more uncertain, and the coverage was estimated by monitoring the LEED pattern after annealing."
[6] "We see that most of the these bands show dispersion nearly identical to that of Pt(111)."
[7] "We observe penetration of this state into a bulk gap, indicative of a true surface state."
[8] "The fact that some surface features are more strongly affected by lanthanum adsorption than others shows that these states are either only weakly coupled to bulk states or hybridize strongly with lanthanum states."
[9] "For the particular film measured in the middle spectrum of Fig. 4 the surface component has vanished completely."
[10] "We see that the spectrum has been reduced to a single component [we have used the same linewidth, but a slightly reduced asymmetry factor compared with the lineshape of Pt(111)]."
[11] "This happens if the amount of lanthanum deposited is below a critical coverage. The critical coverage has previously been estimated to be approximately half a monolayer."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The characterization typically includes angle-resolved photoemission, core-level spectroscopy, and photoelectron diffraction to map the electronic structure and understand the interaction between Ni and Pt atoms at the interface. The process allows researchers to tailor the properties of the bimetallic surfaces for specific applications, such as enhancing catalytic activity or improving stability under harsh conditions.
