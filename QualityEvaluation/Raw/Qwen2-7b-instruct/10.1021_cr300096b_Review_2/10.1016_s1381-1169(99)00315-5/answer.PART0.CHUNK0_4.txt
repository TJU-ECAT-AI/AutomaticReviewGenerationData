The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves cleaning the surfaces in an ultra-high vacuum UHV chamber and then depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. High pressure experiments up to 1 atm can be carried out in a small-volume cubic chamber. The surfaces are then subjected to electrochemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms in an attached cubic chamber filled with 1 atm of highly pure Ar gas. The reactions are monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The bimetallic surfaces are characterized by analyzing the depth distribution of Pt and Rh atoms using techniques like layer-by-layer analysis by an FIM atom probe analysis or by studying the spatial distribution of N and NO using N15. The role of Rh in these bimetallic surfaces remains unclear. The desorption of NO from the Pd 110 surface emits N in a specific direction, and this is explained by a reaction involving NO molecules and N atoms. This discovery suggests that the activation mechanisms of these bimetallic surfaces might involve a chemical restructuring process, which is responsible for enhancing their catalytic activity.

对于Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，涉及在超高真空UHV室中清洁表面，并在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。可以进行高达1atm的压力实验在一个小型立方体容器中。然后在附带的立方体容器中通过填充1atm的高纯度Ar气体对表面进行电化学沉积Pt或Rh原子。反应使用四极质谱仪进行监控。通过分析Pt和Rh原子的深度分布来表征双金属表面，使用FIM原子探针分析等技术进行层间分析，或者通过使用N15研究N和NO的空间分布。Rh在这些双金属表面的作用仍然不清楚。Pd 110表面脱吸NO时发出的N在特定方向发射，这可以通过NO分子与N原子的反应解释。这一发现表明，这些双金属表面的激活机制可能涉及到化学重构过程，这导致其催化活性增强。
