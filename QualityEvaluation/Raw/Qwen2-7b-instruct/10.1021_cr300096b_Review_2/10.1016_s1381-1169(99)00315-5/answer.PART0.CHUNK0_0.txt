In the case of Rh 100 and Rh 110 surfaces, the sample crystal was heated in O2
y8 . 5=10 Torr at 760780 K for 20 min.
Then, it was followed by repeating the Arion sputtering and annealing at 10001200 K.

For Pt 100 and Pt 110 surfaces, the surface was cleaned by repeating the Arion sputtering and annealing at 1100 K in UHV.

After the annealing, the Pt 100 surface gave a 5=20 LEED pattern and the Pt 110 gave a p 1=2 LEED pattern.

Bimetallic surfaces were prepared by electro-chemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms on a desired Rh or Pt single crystal surface in an attached small volume cubic chamber.

The cubic reactor was filled with 1 atm of highly pure Ar gas. Then, an electrochemical quartz cell filled with 0.05 M H SO solution 2 4 containing a certain concentration of Pt or Rh ion was lifted in the cubic cell to make a meniscus contact between the solution surface and one side of the crystal surface.

Details of the electrochemical deposition were described elsewhere 11,12 .

Temperature programmed reaction TPR was performed by raising the temperature in a flow of a mixture of NO and H typically 5.8=10 2 y8 .
Torr of NO and 1.6=10 Torr of H , and the reaction was monitored by a quadrupole mass spectrometer.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves heating the sample crystal in oxygen at specific temperatures for a period of time, followed by Ar sputtering and annealing at higher temperatures. The Pt 100 surface exhibits a 5=20 LEED pattern, while the Pt 110 surface displays a p 1=2 LEED pattern after cleaning. Bimetallic surfaces are created through electrochemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms on Rh or Pt single crystal surfaces within a cubic chamber. The cubic reactor is filled with argon gas, and a meniscus contact is made between the solution surface and the crystal surface. Temperature programmed reaction TPR is carried out by heating the sample in a flow of nitrogen oxide and hydrogen, monitoring the reaction with a quadrupole mass spectrometer.

This process is essential for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control of surface conditions, leading to the formation of specific surface structures that influence catalytic activity.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在特定温度下加热样品晶体一段时间，随后进行氩离子溅射和在较高温度下退火。Pt 100表面表现出5=20 LEED模式，而Pt 110表面显示为p 1=2 LEED模式。通过电化学沉积在Rh或Pt单晶表面形成双金属表面。立方反应器填充有氩气，溶液表面与晶面之间形成接触。通过加热样品在氮氧化物和氢气的流动中进行温度程序化反应传输率（TPR），并使用四极质谱仪监测反应。

这个过程对于先进的表面科学和催化研究中的结构建模、第一性原理计算以及全面理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许精确控制表面条件，导致形成影响催化活性的特定表面结构。
