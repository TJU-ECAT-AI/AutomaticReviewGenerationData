[1] "Single crystal sample disk was bridged between the two Ta wires 0.25-mm diameter by spot welding and was heated by direct current through the Ta wires."
[2] "The surfaces of Pt 100, Pt 110, Rh 100, Rh 110, and PtRh 100 alloy PtrRh surfaces were cleaned in an ultra-high vacuum UHV chamber."
[3] "Bimetallic surfaces were prepared by electrochemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms on a desired Rh or Pt single crystal surface in an attached small volume cubic chamber."
[4] "The cubic reactor was filled with 1 atm of highly pure Ar gas. Then, an electrochemical quartz cell filled with 0.05 M H2SO4 solution containing a certain concentration of Pt or Rh ion was lifted in the cubic cell to make a meniscus contact between the solution surface and one side of the crystal surface."
[5] "The role of Rh is still not clear. When a p1=1 PtRh 100 alloy surface was heated in 0.25 0.75 NO or O2, Rh atoms were markedly segregated on the surface, and a sharp p3=1 LEED pattern appeared."
[6] "The reconstructed p3=1 PtRh 100 rO surface has remarkable catalytic activity for the reaction of NOqH."
[7] "The catalytic activity of the reconstructed bimetallic surfaces is almost equal to that of the p3=1 RhrPt 100 rO surface."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves cleaning them in an ultra-high vacuum UHV chamber. Electrochemical deposition is used to prepare these surfaces on Rh or Pt single crystal surfaces in a cubic chamber filled with 1 atm of highly pure Ar gas. By lifting an electrochemical quartz cell filled with 0.05 M H2SO4 solution containing Pt or Rh ions, a meniscus contact is made between the solution surface and the crystal surface. Heating these surfaces in 0.25 0.75 NO or O2 causes Rh atoms to segregate, leading to a sharp p3=1 LEED pattern. The reconstructed p3=1 PtRh 100 rO surface exhibits high catalytic activity for the NOqH reaction. The catalytic activity of the reconstructed surfaces is nearly identical to that of the p3=1 RhrPt 100 rO surface.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在超高真空UHV室中清洁它们。通过电化学沉积在填充1大气压高纯氩气的立方体容器中的单晶Rh或Pt表面上制备这些表面。通过提升填充0.05 M H2SO4溶液的电解石英细胞，该溶液含有Pt或Rh离子，在晶体表面与溶液表面之间形成液面接触。对这些表面加热至0.25 0.75 NO或O2会导致Rh原子分离，产生尖锐的p3=1 LEED图案。重构的p3=1 PtRh 100 rO表面对于NOqH反应表现出高催化活性。重构表面的催化活性几乎与p3=1 RhrPt 100 rO表面相同。
