reaction on RhrPt 100 , Rhr 2 ( ) ( ) ( ) Pt 110 , PtrRh 100 , and PtrRh 110 bimetal- lic surfaces From a general viewpoint of the practical catalyst, structure-sensitive catalysis is undoubt- edly a serious disadvantage. For example, in the case of the Pt and Rh catalyst, only a limited part of Pt andror Rh will work as catalyst for the reaction of NOqH , and a large part of Pt 2 .

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying the surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The surfaces are heated in the presence of oxygen to induce segregation of the Rh atoms and subsequent restructuring, leading to the formation of a p 3=1 structure. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, as it reveals the local structure of the active sites. The characterization includes techniques such as Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). The restructuring of the surfaces, particularly the formation of the p 3=1 structure, enhances the catalytic activity for the reaction of NOqH, making the bimetallic surfaces structure-insensitive and highly active. This is significant in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it provides insights into optimizing catalysts for better performance in removing pollutants like NO, CO, and hydrocarbons in automotive exhaust gases.

对于由在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，包括在超高压真空条件下研究表面。通过加热表面并在氧气的存在下诱导Rh原子的分离和随后的重构，形成p 3=1结构。这个过程对于理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它揭示了活性位点的局部结构。表征技术包括低能电子衍射（LEED）、Auger电子能谱（AES）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）。表面的重构，特别是p 3=1结构的形成，增强了对NOqH反应的催化活性，使双金属表面结构不敏感且高度活跃。这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究具有重要意义，为优化去除汽车尾气中的NO、CO和碳氢化合物等污染物的催化剂性能提供了见解。
