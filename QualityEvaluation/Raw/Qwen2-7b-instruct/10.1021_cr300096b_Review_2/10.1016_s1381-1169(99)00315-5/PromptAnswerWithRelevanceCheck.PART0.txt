In the case of Rh 100 and Rh 110 surfaces, the sample crystal was heated in O2
y8 . 5=10 Torr at 760780 K for 20 min.
Then, it was followed by repeating the Arion sputtering and annealing at 10001200 K.

For Pt 100 and Pt 110 surfaces, the surface was cleaned by repeating the Arion sputtering and annealing at 1100 K in UHV.

After the annealing, the Pt 100 surface gave a 5=20 LEED pattern and the Pt 110 gave a p 1=2 LEED pattern.

Bimetallic surfaces were prepared by electro-chemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms on a desired Rh or Pt single crystal surface in an attached small volume cubic chamber.

The cubic reactor was filled with 1 atm of highly pure Ar gas. Then, an electrochemical quartz cell filled with 0.05 M H SO solution 2 4 containing a certain concentration of Pt or Rh ion was lifted in the cubic cell to make a meniscus contact between the solution surface and one side of the crystal surface.

Details of the electrochemical deposition were described elsewhere 11,12 .

Temperature programmed reaction TPR was performed by raising the temperature in a flow of a mixture of NO and H typically 5.8=10 2 y8 .
Torr of NO and 1.6=10 Torr of H , and the reaction was monitored by a quadrupole mass spectrometer.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves heating the sample crystal in oxygen at specific temperatures for a period of time, followed by Ar sputtering and annealing at higher temperatures. The Pt 100 surface exhibits a 5=20 LEED pattern, while the Pt 110 surface displays a p 1=2 LEED pattern after cleaning. Bimetallic surfaces are created through electrochemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms on Rh or Pt single crystal surfaces within a cubic chamber. The cubic reactor is filled with argon gas, and a meniscus contact is made between the solution surface and the crystal surface. Temperature programmed reaction TPR is carried out by heating the sample in a flow of nitrogen oxide and hydrogen, monitoring the reaction with a quadrupole mass spectrometer.

This process is essential for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control of surface conditions, leading to the formation of specific surface structures that influence catalytic activity.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying the surfaces under ultra-high vacuum conditions. The surfaces are heated in the presence of oxygen to induce segregation of the Rh atoms and subsequent restructuring, leading to the formation of a p 3=1 structure. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, as it reveals the local structure of the active sites. The characterization includes techniques such as Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). The restructuring of the surfaces, particularly the formation of the p 3=1 structure, enhances the catalytic activity for the reaction of NOqH, making the bimetallic surfaces structure-insensitive and highly active. This is significant in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it provides insights into optimizing catalysts for better performance in removing pollutants like NO, CO, and hydrocarbons in automotive exhaust gases.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves cleaning the surfaces in an ultra-high vacuum UHV chamber and then depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. High pressure experiments up to 1 atm can be carried out in a small-volume cubic chamber. The surfaces are then subjected to electrochemical deposition of Pt or Rh atoms in an attached cubic chamber filled with 1 atm of highly pure Ar gas. The reactions are monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The bimetallic surfaces are characterized by analyzing the depth distribution of Pt and Rh atoms using techniques like layer-by-layer analysis by an FIM atom probe analysis or by studying the spatial distribution of N and NO using N15. The role of Rh in these bimetallic surfaces remains unclear. The desorption of NO from the Pd 110 surface emits N in a specific direction, and this is explained by a reaction involving NO molecules and N atoms. This discovery suggests that the activation mechanisms of these bimetallic surfaces might involve a chemical restructuring process, which is responsible for enhancing their catalytic activity.
