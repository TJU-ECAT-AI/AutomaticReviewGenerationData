The formation of CuPt alloys on the Cu(1 0 0) surface by Pt deposition and subsequent annealing has been widely studied using many experimental and theoretical techniques. However, similar investigations on Cu(1 0 0) have been less common, and hence the characteristics of this system are less well understood. One of the earliest studies of the Cu(1 0 0)/Pt alloy was carried out by Graham et al. using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). In this study, it was demonstrated that at room temperature, Pt forms disordered islands on the surface with some intermixing from the Cu substrate, giving a weak c(2 × 2) LEED pattern which strengthened significantly on annealing to 300 C. This ordering was attributed to the formation of a pure Cu surface layer with a CuPt alloy formed beneath the surface. A tensor low energy electron diffraction (TLEED) study by Al Shamaileh et al. supported this analysis by observing pure Cu surface layers after annealing samples with Pt coverages of 0.5 ML, 1.0 ML and 1.5 ML at 300 C. This view was also shared by Reilly et al. who observed a c(2 × 2) structure after annealing to 230 C.

Answer: Studies on the formation of CuPt alloys on Cu(1 0 0) have been less frequent compared to other surface systems. Early research by Graham et al., employing AES, LEIS, and LEED, revealed that at room temperature, Pt forms disordered islands on the surface with some intermixing from the Cu substrate, leading to a weak c(2 × 2) LEED pattern that strengthened significantly upon annealing to 300°C. This process was attributed to the formation of a pure Cu surface layer with a CuPt alloy beneath it. Al Shamaileh et al.'s TLEED study corroborated this by showing pure Cu surface layers after annealing samples with Pt coverages of 0.5 ML, 1.0 ML, and 1.5 ML at 300°C. Reilly et al. also observed a c(2 × 2) structure after annealing to 230°C.

研究发现，在Cu(1 0 0)表面上形成CuPt合金的实验较少。格雷厄姆等人的早期研究使用了AES、LEIS和LEED，证明在室温下，Pt在表面形成无序岛屿，并与Cu基体发生部分互混，产生一个弱的c(2 × 2) LEED模式，经过300°C的退火后强度显著增强。这一过程被归因于表面形成纯Cu层，其下方是CuPt合金。阿勒沙玛伊勒等人通过TLEED研究支持了这一分析，观察到在300°C退火后，具有0.5 ML、1.0 ML和1.5 ML Pt覆盖量的样品表面层为纯Cu层。里利等人的研究也表明，当退火至230°C时，会出现c(2 × 2)结构。
