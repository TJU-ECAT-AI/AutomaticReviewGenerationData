[1] "CAICISS data show the formation of a CuPt alloy at room temperature in the top three atomic layers at sub-monolayer Pt coverage."
[2] "As the coverage increases up to 2.75 ML the formation of a Pt overlayer is observed in conjunction with the near surface region becoming Pt-rich, indicating the onset of layer-by-layer growth."
[3] "Subsequent annealing shows a significant migration of Pt into the bulk Cu at a temperature of 300 C."
[4] "Evidence for a more ordered surface after annealing is also presented."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it enables the study of the structure, electronic, and chemical properties of these surfaces. By examining the formation of CuPt alloys, the layer-by-layer composition, and interlayer spacings, researchers can understand the behavior of these surfaces under different conditions. Subsequent annealing at temperatures like 300°C facilitates the migration of Pt atoms into the bulk Cu, leading to an ordered alloy structure. This provides insights into the stability and functionality of the bimetallic surfaces, particularly in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程至关重要，因为它使研究这些表面的结构、电子和化学性质成为可能。通过观察CuPt合金的形成、层间组成和层间距的变化，研究人员可以了解在不同条件下这些表面的行为。随后在300°C左右的温度下进行退火，使Pt原子迁移到Cu基体中，导致有序合金结构的形成。这为理解双金属表面的稳定性和功能提供了见解，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究领域。
