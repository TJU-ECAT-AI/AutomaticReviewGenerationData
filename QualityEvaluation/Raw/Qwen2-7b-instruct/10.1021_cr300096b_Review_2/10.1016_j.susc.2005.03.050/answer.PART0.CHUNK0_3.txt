<p>The formation of CuPt alloys on the Cu(1 0 0) surface by Pt deposition and subsequent annealing has been widely studied using many experimental and theoretical techniques.</p>
<p>CAICISS is a unique surface science technique which offers both chemical and structural information with a high degree of surface specificity.</p>
<p>At higher coverages the surface becomes Pt-rich. Moreover, certain features observed in the CAICISS data at higher Pt coverages can only be explained by a small Pt concentration (0.12 ML) on top of the Pt-rich surface layers. This indicates the onset of layer-by-layer growth of a pure Pt film.</p>
<p>Annealing of the sample containing 2.75 ML of Pt at 300 C resulted in the migration of Pt from the surface region into the substrate and forming a more ordered alloy structure.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The use of techniques such as co-axial impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy (CAICISS) provides detailed information about the chemical composition and atomic structure of the surfaces. The study reveals that as the Pt coverage increases, the surface becomes Pt-rich, and at higher coverages, a small Pt concentration on top of the Pt-rich surface layers suggests the onset of layer-by-layer growth of a pure Pt film. Upon annealing at 300 C, the Pt migrates from the surface into the substrate, leading to a more ordered alloy structure.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。使用如轴对称冲击碰撞离子散射光谱（CAICISS）等技术，可以提供关于表面化学组成和原子结构的详细信息。研究表明，随着Pt覆盖度的增加，表面变得富含Pt，而在较高覆盖度下，在富含Pt的表面层顶部观察到的小Pt浓度表明纯Pt薄膜层间生长的开始。在300°C的退火处理后，Pt从表面迁移到基体中，导致形成更有序的合金结构。
