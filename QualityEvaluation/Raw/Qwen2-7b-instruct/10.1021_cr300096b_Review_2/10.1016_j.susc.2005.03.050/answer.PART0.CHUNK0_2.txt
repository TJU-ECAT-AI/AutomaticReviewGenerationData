The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. Techniques such as CAICISS, which provides both chemical and structural information with high surface specificity, are utilized. Data analysis employs software like FAN to simulate and interpret the atomic structure and composition of the bimetallic layers. This approach enables researchers to assess the interlayer spacings, layer-by-layer compositions, and the formation of alloys, which are essential for applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
