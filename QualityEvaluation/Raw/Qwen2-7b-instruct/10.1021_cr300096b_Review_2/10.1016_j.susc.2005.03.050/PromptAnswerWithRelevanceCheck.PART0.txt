[1] "CAICISS data show the formation of a CuPt alloy at room temperature in the top three atomic layers at sub-monolayer Pt coverage."
[2] "As the coverage increases up to 2.75 ML the formation of a Pt overlayer is observed in conjunction with the near surface region becoming Pt-rich, indicating the onset of layer-by-layer growth."
[3] "Subsequent annealing shows a significant migration of Pt into the bulk Cu at a temperature of 300 C."
[4] "Evidence for a more ordered surface after annealing is also presented."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it enables the study of the structure, electronic, and chemical properties of these surfaces. By examining the formation of CuPt alloys, the layer-by-layer composition, and interlayer spacings, researchers can understand the behavior of these surfaces under different conditions. Subsequent annealing at temperatures like 300°C facilitates the migration of Pt atoms into the bulk Cu, leading to an ordered alloy structure. This provides insights into the stability and functionality of the bimetallic surfaces, particularly in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程至关重要，因为它使研究这些表面的结构、电子和化学性质成为可能。通过观察CuPt合金的形成、层间组成和层间距的变化，研究人员可以了解在不同条件下这些表面的行为。随后在300°C左右的温度下进行退火，使Pt原子迁移到Cu基体中，导致有序合金结构的形成。这为理解双金属表面的稳定性和功能提供了见解，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究领域。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The use of techniques such as co-axial impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy (CAICISS) provides detailed information about the chemical composition and atomic structure of the surfaces. The study reveals that as the Pt coverage increases, the surface becomes Pt-rich, and at higher coverages, a small Pt concentration on top of the Pt-rich surface layers suggests the onset of layer-by-layer growth of a pure Pt film. Upon annealing at 300 C, the Pt migrates from the surface into the substrate, leading to a more ordered alloy structure.

The formation of CuPt alloys on the Cu(1 0 0) surface by Pt deposition and subsequent annealing has been widely studied using many experimental and theoretical techniques. However, similar investigations on Cu(1 0 0) have been less common, and hence the characteristics of this system are less well understood. One of the earliest studies of the Cu(1 0 0)/Pt alloy was carried out by Graham et al. using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). In this study, it was demonstrated that at room temperature, Pt forms disordered islands on the surface with some intermixing from the Cu substrate, giving a weak c(2 × 2) LEED pattern which strengthened significantly on annealing to 300 C. This ordering was attributed to the formation of a pure Cu surface layer with a CuPt alloy formed beneath the surface. A tensor low energy electron diffraction (TLEED) study by Al Shamaileh et al. supported this analysis by observing pure Cu surface layers after annealing samples with Pt coverages of 0.5 ML, 1.0 ML and 1.5 ML at 300 C. This view was also shared by Reilly et al. who observed a c(2 × 2) structure after annealing to 230 C.

Answer: Studies on the formation of CuPt alloys on Cu(1 0 0) have been less frequent compared to other surface systems. Early research by Graham et al., employing AES, LEIS, and LEED, revealed that at room temperature, Pt forms disordered islands on the surface with some intermixing from the Cu substrate, leading to a weak c(2 × 2) LEED pattern that strengthened significantly upon annealing to 300°C. This process was attributed to the formation of a pure Cu surface layer with a CuPt alloy beneath it. Al Shamaileh et al.'s TLEED study corroborated this by showing pure Cu surface layers after annealing samples with Pt coverages of 0.5 ML, 1.0 ML, and 1.5 ML at 300°C. Reilly et al. also observed a c(2 × 2) structure after annealing to 230°C.

研究发现，在Cu(1 0 0)表面上形成CuPt合金的实验较少。格雷厄姆等人的早期研究使用了AES、LEIS和LEED，证明在室温下，Pt在表面形成无序岛屿，并与Cu基体发生部分互混，产生一个弱的c(2 × 2) LEED模式，经过300°C的退火后强度显著增强。这一过程被归因于表面形成纯Cu层，其下方是CuPt合金。阿勒沙玛伊勒等人通过TLEED研究支持了这一分析，观察到在300°C退火后，具有0.5 ML、1.0 ML和1.5 ML Pt覆盖量的样品表面层为纯Cu层。里利等人的研究也表明，当退火至230°C时，会出现c(2 × 2)结构。
