[1] "Alloys and bimetallic surfaces have received much attention in recent years due to their importance in many modern technological processes (e.g. heterogeneous catalysis and magnetic recording [1] ,[2] ,[3] )."
[2] "The formation of CuPt alloys on the Cu(1 1 1) surface by Pt deposition and subsequent annealing has been widely studied using many experimental and theoretical techniques [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ."
[3] "The CuPt surface alloy system has been the subject of numerous studies, ranging from Cu deposition on Pt surfaces [4] ,[5] ,[6] ,[7] , to single crystal alloy surfaces [8] ,[9] and Pt deposition on Cu surfaces [10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] ,[15] ,[16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] ,[21] ,[22] ,[23] ,[24] ,[25] ."
[4] "The CuPt alloy formation continues with the central peaks in the CAICISS spectra becoming more pronounced with increasing Pt deposition up to 2.75 ML."
[5] "We noticed that during the growth process the surface peak and second layer peak both shifted to higher polar angles. The surface peak recorded at 16 on the clean surface was shifted to 18 after Pt deposition of 2.75 ML. The peak corresponding to scattering from second layer atoms shifted in a similar manner from 44 to 45."
[6] "Annealing to 300 C led to the migration of Pt from the surface region into the substrate and forming a more ordered alloy structure."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying the formation of CuPt alloys on the surface. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The characterization includes monitoring changes in interlayer spacings, formation of alloys, shifts in peak positions in CAICISS spectra, and the effects of annealing on the structure of the alloy. The process helps in comprehending how the properties of the bimetallic surfaces evolve with the deposition of Ni monolayers and subsequent interactions with the Pt substrate.
