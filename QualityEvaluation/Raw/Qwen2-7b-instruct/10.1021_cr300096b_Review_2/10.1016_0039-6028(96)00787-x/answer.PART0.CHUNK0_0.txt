[1] "The experimental conditions of this work have been described elsewhere [12]. As already mentioned, the main source of information were A measurements which were made with the diode method, in particular in the constant current mode."
[2] "Unfortunately, direct resistive heating disturbs the Ab measurement since the magnetic field of the heating current deflects the electron beam."
[3] "The temperature was measured with a thermocouple calibrated with optical and infrared pyrometers with an accuracy of + 5 K."
[4] "The layers were heated to 1200 K in the case of Rh and Pt and T--1500 K for Ir, and the temperature was then gradually lowered and the LEED pattern was recorded simultaneously."
[5] "The satellite splitting in regions 3 and 4 is [ 112]/2n with n ranging from 11 to 18 and an average a= 14.7__+_1.3."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, as it allows researchers to precisely control and study the interactions between Ni and Pt atoms. The characterization uses techniques such as work-function measurements (A) and LEED analysis. Work-function measurements are sensitive to changes in atomic roughness, providing insights into the phase transition from a two-dimensional condensate to a dilute layer. LEED analysis helps determine the atomic structure and bonding of the deposited layers. By combining these methods, scientists can gain a comprehensive understanding of the properties and behavior of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些表面的电子和化学性质的理解至关重要，因为它允许研究人员精确控制并研究Ni和Pt原子之间的相互作用。表征使用技术如工作函数测量（A）和LEED分析。工作函数测量对原子粗糙度的变化非常敏感，提供了从二维凝聚态到稀释层的相变的见解。LEED分析有助于确定沉积层的原子结构和键合。通过结合这两种方法，科学家可以获得对Ni/Pt双金属表面属性和行为的全面理解，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
