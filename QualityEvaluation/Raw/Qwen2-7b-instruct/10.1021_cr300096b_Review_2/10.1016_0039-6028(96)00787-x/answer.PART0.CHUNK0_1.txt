[1] "The behavior of Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt on the W(110) face above room temperature was reported."
[2] "Some properties of submonolayers of platinum family metals on the W(110) surface at T> 300 K are reported."
[3] "A phase transition from a 2D gas to a 2D condensate is observed for Pd, Rh, and Pt, and the phase boundary is determined."
[4] "In this work we report the behavior of platinum metal adsorbates at temperatures above room temperature."
[5] "The results were obtained mainly from work-function change (Ab) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements as a function of temperature."
[6] "The power of the method rests on its very high sensitivity to changes of the surface roughness on an atomic scale."
[7] "The accuracy of our Ab measurement was _ _ + 2 meV."
[8] "The temperature was measured with a thermocouple calibrated with optical and infrared pyrometers with an accuracy of + 5 K."
[9] "The coverage 0 was determined by AES and LEED measurements presented elsewhere [ 12] for Rh, Ir and Pt and in Ref. [13] for Pd."
[10] "The temperature dependence of the work-function changes of Pd are 'typical', i.e. they are identical to those observed earlier for noble metals [3,4]."
[11] "The work-function change accompanying this process is larger than 0.1 eV (see Fig. 2d), which suggests a high density of domain walls."
[12] "The magnitude of the Agp(T) dependence on the heating temperature (Fig. 3) may have its origin in the metastable solid phase [12]."
[13] "The onset temperature of the linear segments can be used to determine the 'coexistence line' separating the 2D gas phase from the phase coexistence region."
[14] "The oscillations of the Aq(O) curves at high temperatures are connected with the different LEED structures."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the surface, thereby influencing its reactivity and catalytic activity. The ability to synthesize such surfaces with controlled thicknesses and compositions enables detailed investigation of the interactions between Ni and Pt atoms, which can significantly affect the surface's electronic structure and chemical reactivity. This, in turn, provides insights into the mechanisms of catalytic reactions occurring on these surfaces, allowing for the optimization of catalyst performance and the design of more efficient catalytic materials.
