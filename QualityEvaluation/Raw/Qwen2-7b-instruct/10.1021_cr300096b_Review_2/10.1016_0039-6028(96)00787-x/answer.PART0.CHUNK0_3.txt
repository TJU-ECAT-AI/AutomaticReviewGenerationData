[1] "Some properties of submonolayers of platinum family metals on the W(110) surface at T> 300 K are reported."
[2] "The results were obtained mainly from work-function change (Ab) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements as a function of temperature."
[3] "The accuracy of our Ab measurement was _ _ + 2 meV."
[4] "Unfortunately, direct resistive heating disturbs the Ab measurement since the magnetic field of the heating current deflects the electron beam."
[5] "At coverages 0>0.07 ML, although the two curve segments are still visible, the curvature of the first segment varies, as shown in Fig. 2b and c."
[6] "The only change noticed in the LEED patterns for 8>2/3 is the vanishing of the satellite spots with increasing temperature, which is a consequence of the decreasing strain energy (due to decreasing shear modulus G), so that domain walls are no longer necessary."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt surfaces to create a bimetallic interface, which is essential for studying the interactions and properties of the resulting surface. The characterization techniques used include work-function change (Ab) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements. These measurements provide insights into the surface properties and dynamics under varying temperatures, helping researchers understand the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces. The accuracy of the work-function change measurements is quite high, with an error margin of just 2 meV. However, direct resistive heating can disturb the measurements due to the deflection of the electron beam by the magnetic field of the heating current. At higher coverages, the curvature of the work-function change curves varies, indicating changes in the surface structure. As the temperature increases, the satellite spots in the LEED patterns disappear, suggesting a reduction in strain energy and the elimination of domain walls, which are crucial for understanding the evolution of the bimetallic surface structure under different conditions.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层进行的。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。该过程涉及在Pt表面上沉积Ni单层以创建双金属界面，这对于研究形成表面的相互作用和性质至关重要。表征技术包括工作函数变化（Ab）和低能电子衍射（LEED）测量。这些测量提供了温度变化下表面性质和动态的见解，帮助研究人员了解双金属表面的行为。工作函数变化测量的准确性相当高，误差仅为2 meV。然而，直接电阻加热可能会干扰测量，因为加热电流产生的磁场会偏转电子束。在更高的覆盖率下，工作函数变化曲线的曲率发生变化，表明表面结构的变化。随着温度的升高，LEED模式中的卫星斑点消失，这表明应变能的减少和域墙的消除，这对于理解在不同条件下双金属表面结构的演变至关重要。
