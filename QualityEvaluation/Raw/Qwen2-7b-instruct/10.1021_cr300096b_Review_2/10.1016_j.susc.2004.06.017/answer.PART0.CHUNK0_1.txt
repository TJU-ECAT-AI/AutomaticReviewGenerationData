[1] "The core level binding energy shifts and linewidths of the Au 4f core level as a function of surface Au coverage were measured and found independent on surface structure in the case of Pt substrate."
[2] "The results point to the formation of Au/Pt alloy interface in early stages of Au deposition in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface."
[3] "The measured core level binding energy shifts are semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise measurement of core level binding energy shifts and linewidths of the Au 4f core level as a function of surface Au coverage. These measurements, found to be independent of surface structure in the case of the Pt substrate, indicate the formation of an Au/Pt alloy interface during Au deposition, contrasting with the abrupt Au/Re interface. The measured core level binding energy shifts are also semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation, providing insights into the electronic properties of these bimetallic surfaces.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及深入了解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许精确测量Au 4f核心能级作为表面Au覆盖率函数的核心水平能级偏移和线宽。这些发现表明，在Pt基板的情况下，表面结构独立的Au覆盖度，表明在Au沉积的早期阶段形成了Au/Pt合金界面，与Au/Re界面的突变形成对比。测量的核心能级偏移也通过初始状态近似方法内的理论计算半定量地重现，提供了关于这些双金属表面的电子性质的见解。
