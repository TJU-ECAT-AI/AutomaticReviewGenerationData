[1] "Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission."
[2] "Consequently, the results obtained seem to indicate that intermixing occurs at the Au/Pt interface in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface."
[3] "The measured core level binding energy shifts are semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation."

1. The shifts of the Pt 4f core electron binding energy caused by gold deposition are small, measurable, and reproducible, amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au. These shifts occur without altering the normal emission pattern.
2. The findings suggest that intermixing takes place at the Au/Pt interface, unlike the abrupt Au/Re interface. 
3. The observed shifts in the core level binding energy can be qualitatively explained by theoretical calculations using the initial state approximation.

1. 金沉积引起的基态铂4f电子结合能偏移很小，可测量且可重复，几层Au时为0.07 eV。这些偏移不会改变正常发射模式。
2. 结果表明，在Au/Pt界面处发生混晶，而在Au/Re界面处则截然不同。
3. 观测到的核心能级结合能偏移可以通过初始状态近似方法的理论计算大致解释。
