[1] "Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission."
[2] "Consequently, the results obtained seem to indicate that intermixing occurs at the Au/Pt interface in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface."
[3] "The measured core level binding energy shifts are semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control and examination of the interaction and composition at the interface between the two metals. The shifts in core level binding energies and linewidths of the Au 4f core level, which are measured as a function of surface Au coverage, provide insights into the formation of the interface and the properties of the bimetallic system.

[1] "Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission."
[2] "In contrast to Au/Pt system, unexpectedly small and positive CLS of Au 4f electrons are observed for Au depositons on Re (Fig. 1)."
[3] "Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission. The magnitude of this shift was dependent on the take-off angle; it increased with decreasing take-off angle (defined from the sample surface) indicating thus presence of additional component in the spectra of Pt 4f electrons, which can be assigned to the Au/Pt interface alloy."

1. The shifts of the Pt 4f core electron binding energy caused by gold deposition are small, measurable, and reproducible, amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au. These shifts occur without altering the normal emission pattern.
2. The findings suggest that intermixing takes place at the Au/Pt interface, unlike the abrupt Au/Re interface. 
3. The observed shifts in the core level binding energy can be qualitatively explained by theoretical calculations using the initial state approximation.
