[1] "Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission."
[2] "In contrast to Au/Pt system, unexpectedly small and positive CLS of Au 4f electrons are observed for Au depositons on Re (Fig. 1)."
[3] "Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission. The magnitude of this shift was dependent on the take-off angle; it increased with decreasing take-off angle (defined from the sample surface) indicating thus presence of additional component in the spectra of Pt 4f electrons, which can be assigned to the Au/Pt interface alloy."
[4] "The results pointed to the formation of Au/Pt alloy interface in early stages of Au deposition in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface."
[5] "The measured core level binding energy shifts are semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying the shifts of the core level binding energies and linewidths of the Au 4f core level as a function of surface Au coverage. These processes are crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because they allow researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The characterization helps in predicting the behavior of the surfaces under various conditions and optimizing their use in catalytic applications.
