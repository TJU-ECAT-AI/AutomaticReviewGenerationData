[1] "The core level binding energy shifts and linewidths of the Au 4f core level as a function of surface Au coverage were measured and found independent on surface structure in the case of Pt substrate."
[2] "The results point to the formation of Au/Pt alloy interface in early stages of Au deposition in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface."
[3] "The measured core level binding energy shifts are semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control and measurement of surface compositions and interactions. The ability to measure the shifts in core level binding energies and linewidths as a function of surface coverage provides insights into the formation of interfaces and alloys, which are essential for predicting and optimizing the performance of materials in various applications.
