[1] "Gold deposition induces rather small but measurable and reproducible shifts of the substrate Pt 4f spectra amounting to 0.07 eV for several monolayers of Au and normal emission."
[2] "Consequently, the results obtained seem to indicate that intermixing occurs at the Au/Pt interface in contrast to abrupt Au/Re interface."
[3] "The measured core level binding energy shifts are semi-quantitatively reproduced by theoretical calculations within the initial state approximation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control and examination of the interaction and composition at the interface between the two metals. The shifts in core level binding energies and linewidths of the Au 4f core level, which are measured as a function of surface Au coverage, provide insights into the formation of the interface and the properties of the bimetallic system.
