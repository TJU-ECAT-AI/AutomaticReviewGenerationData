[1] "The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same."
[2] "This features which occurs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through various methods including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), local tunneling barrier height (LBH) imaging, and other surface analysis techniques. These processes are crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because they allow researchers to visualize and quantify the surface morphology, work function variations, and interfacial properties. Understanding these properties is essential for optimizing the performance of catalysts and other materials in industrial applications.
