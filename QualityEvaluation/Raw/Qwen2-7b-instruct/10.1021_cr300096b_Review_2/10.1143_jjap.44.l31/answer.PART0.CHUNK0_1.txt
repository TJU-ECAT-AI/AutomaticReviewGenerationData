[1] "The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same."
[2] "This features which occurs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves examining their electronic and chemical properties. This process is crucial because it allows for structural modeling and DFT calculations, providing insights into the complex interactions and functionalities of these surfaces. Understanding these properties is essential for advancing research in surface science and catalysis, enabling the optimization of catalyst performance and the development of new materials with enhanced functionalities.
