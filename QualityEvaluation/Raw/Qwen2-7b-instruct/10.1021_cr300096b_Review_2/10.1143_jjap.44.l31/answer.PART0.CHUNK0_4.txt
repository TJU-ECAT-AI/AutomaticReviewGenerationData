[1] "The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same."
[2] "This features which occurrs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through various methods such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and x-ray diffraction (XRD). These methods are crucial for structural modeling because they allow researchers to visualize the atomic structure of the bimetallic surfaces, understand the interface between Ni and Pt layers, and determine the precise composition and arrangement of atoms. For DFT calculations, accurate structural models are essential to perform quantum mechanical simulations that predict electronic and chemical properties of the surfaces. These predictions help in understanding catalytic activities, adsorption behaviors, and reaction mechanisms. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces aids in designing materials with optimized catalytic performance, improving efficiency in chemical reactions, and developing new catalysts for industrial applications.

通过扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、能量色散X射线光谱（EDX）、高分辨透射电子显微镜（HRTEM）和x射线衍射（XRD）等方法，对在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征。这些方法对于结构建模至关重要，因为它们允许研究人员可视化双金属表面的原子结构、理解Ni和Pt层之间的界面，并确定原子的确切组成和排列。对于第一性原理计算（DFT），精确的结构模型是必不可少的，以便执行量子力学模拟，预测表面的电子和化学性质。这些预测有助于理解催化活性、吸附行为和反应机制。在先进的表面科学和催化研究背景下，对Ni/Pt双金属表面的全面理解有助于设计具有优化催化性能的材料、提高化学反应效率并开发用于工业应用的新催化剂。
