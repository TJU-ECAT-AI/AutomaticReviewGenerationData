[1] "The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same."
[2] "This features which occurs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows researchers to study the interactions and properties at the interface between the two metals. This information is essential for advancing the fields of surface science and catalysis research, enabling the design of materials with optimized performance for various applications.
