[1] "The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same."
[2] "This features which occurrs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. This process is crucial because it allows for the development of models that can accurately predict the behavior of these surfaces under various conditions. The microscopic work function distributions of these surfaces are studied through local tunneling barrier height (LBH) imaging using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The differences in work function between various clusters and terraces on the surface provide insights into the electronic structure and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces. These findings are essential for the design and optimization of catalysts and other materials that rely on the unique properties of bimetallic surfaces.
