[1] "Up to one monolayer (ML) of Pt interdiffusion leads to a surface alloy formed over the first two layers."
[2] "Between 1 and 2 ML the system demixes, giving rise to a pure Pt overlayer, for coverages >2 ML."
[3] "The role of the interface in the surface alloy formation is discussed."
[4] "Previous AES experiments have been carried out, see Ref. [ 111, which favour interdiffusion during the growth, in agreement with field ion microscope experiments which show alloyed bime- tallytic aggregate formation at temperatures < 250 K [ 121."
[5] "We can identify two peaks during growth. Up to 1 ML, the binding energies are (70.9 + 0.03) eV, labelled B*, and (70.5 kO.03) eV,labelled S*, both are shifted by 250 meV with respect to those measured on a clean Pt( 111)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The characterization includes analyzing the surface composition through techniques like AES and core level photoemission spectroscopy, observing the formation of a surface alloy during the initial stages of growth, and noting the demixing of the alloy to form a pure Pt overlayer beyond one monolayer. The interface between Ni and Pt plays a significant role in the growth mechanism and the properties of the bimetallic surfaces.
