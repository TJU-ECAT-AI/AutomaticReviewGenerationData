1. AES experiments have been conducted on Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, showing interdiffusion during synthesis. Field ion microscope experiments agree that alloyed bimetallic aggregates form at temperatures below 250 K. CO adsorption studies were initially performed in the valence band region after successive deposits of Pt/Pd(111).

2. Prior to reaching 1 ML, CO adsorption favors the Pd surface. Between 1 and 2 ML, CO levels shift to higher binding energies. Beyond 2 ML, their position aligns with preferential Pt adsorption.

3. The evolution of Pt 4f,z core level binding energies with Pt coverage is depicted in Fig. 2. Two peaks are identified during growth: B* at (70.9 + 0.03) eV and S* at (70.5 kO.03) eV, both shifted by 250 meV compared to a clean Pt(111).

4. For low Pt coverages, CO adsorption indicates a Pd-rich surface layer. Core level analysis reveals a mixed Pt-Pd surface layer and underlayer region.

5. At 1 ML, the surface peak intensity corresponds to 50% of the Pt(111) surface peak, suggesting that half of the Pt is in the surface layer and the remainder in the second layer. This indicates demixing rather than burial of the Pt-Pd interface.

6. Annealing 2 ML Pt/Pd(111) and creating a Pd/Pt/Pd(111) sandwich extend the Pt coverage range where surface alloy formation is possible. The role of the Pt-Pd interface is critical, despite its negligible size difference.

7. Core level analysis of reference alloys is ongoing to confirm the nature of the Pt-Pd interface.

1. 尼/铂双金属表面的AES实验显示了合成过程中的互扩散。场离子显微镜实验同意，在低于250 K的温度下，形成合金化的双金属聚集体。对CO吸附的研究最初是在连续沉积的Pt/Pd(111)后的价带区域进行的。

2. 在达到1 ML之前，CO吸附倾向于Pd表面。在1至2 ML之间，CO水平向更高的结合能移动。超过2 ML后，它们的位置对应于Pt的优先吸附。

3. 描述了随Pt覆盖度变化的Pt 4f,z核心能级结合能的演变（见图2）。生长过程中识别出两个峰值：B*位于（70.9 + 0.03）eV，S*位于（70.5 kO.03）eV，两者与清洁的Pt(111)相比均向较低的能量偏移了250 meV。

4. 对于低Pt覆盖率，CO吸附表明Pd丰富的表面层。核心能级分析揭示了一个混合的Pt-Pd表面层和下层区域。

5. 在1 ML时，表面峰强度对应于Pt(111)表面峰强度的50%，这意味着Pt的一半在表面层，另一半在第二层。这表明存在分解而不是掩埋Pt-Pd界面。

6. 对于2 ML Pt/Pd(111)的退火和创建Pd/Pt/Pd(111)三明治可以扩展Pt覆盖范围，使表面合金形成成为可能。尽管Pt-Pd界面的大小差异微乎其微，但其作用至关重要。

7. 对参考合金进行的核心能级分析正在进行中，以确认Pt-Pd界面的性质。
