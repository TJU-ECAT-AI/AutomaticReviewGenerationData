[1] "The study of metallic ultra-thin films has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years."
[2] "We present a core level photoemission spectroscopy study, using synchrotron radiation of the first stages of Pt/Pd( 111) growth."
[3] "The two levels visible are the 50+-x and the 40, at 8.2 and 11.2 eV, respectively,on Pd( 11 1 ), whereas on Pt( 111) the binding energies are 9 and 11.9 eV, respectively [7,8]."
[4] "The Pt 4f,,, spectra were analysed following the procedure described in Ref. [14]."
[5] "In each case we observe a clear shift in the peak positions from the situation corresponding to bulk Pt(ll1) to that of the very thin Pt layers (< 1 ML)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It aids in advanced surface science and catalysis research by providing insights into how the properties emerge from the interaction between Ni and Pt at the atomic level.
