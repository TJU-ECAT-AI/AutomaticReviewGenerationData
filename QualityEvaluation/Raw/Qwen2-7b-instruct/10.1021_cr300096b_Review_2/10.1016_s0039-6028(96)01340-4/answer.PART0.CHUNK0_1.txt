[1] "In fact from an energetic point of view three parameters must be considered:the relative surface tension;the relative atomic size; and the tendency of the system
A-B
to alloy or demix."
[2] "Concerning the PES experiments,we ini- tially studied the effect of CO adsorption in the valence band region after successive deposits of Pt/Pd( 111)."
[3] "Up to 1 ML, the CO levels shift upwards in binding energy, >2 ML their position corresponds to preferential adsorp- tion on Pt."
[4] "We can identify two peaks during growth. Up to 1 ML, the binding energies are (70.9 + 0.03) eV, labelled B*, and (70.5 kO.03) eV,labelled S*, both are shifted by 250 meV with respect to those measured on a clean Pt( 111)."
[5] "This suggests that there is demixing rather than burial of the Pt-Pd interface."
[6] "The intensity of the surface peak is the same as that observed of the clean Pt(ll1) surface."
[7] "The role of the Pt-Pd interface, despite the negligible size difference, is crucial."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows scientists to precisely control the composition and structure of the bimetallic interfaces. This control is essential for optimizing the unique properties of these surfaces, such as enhanced catalytic activity, which can significantly impact applications in fields like catalysis and data storage.
