[1] "Room temperature deposition of Pt on Cu(100) has been studied by LEED, AES and desorption spectroscopy indicating that sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K leads to formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters."
[2] "In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection requires thermal activation which leads to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer below a copper monolayer."
[3] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[4] "Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1."
[5] "Thus, the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys differs significantly from that of pure Pt resulting in a much increased stability for the formate intermediate."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is typically conducted through techniques such as LEED (Low-Energy Electron Diffraction), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), and desorption spectroscopy. These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition process allows for the creation of surfaces with specific compositions and structures that can exhibit unique properties compared to their pure metal counterparts. The characterization helps in elucidating the interactions between the Ni and Pt layers, their atomic arrangements, and how these affect the overall surface chemistry and reactivity, particularly in terms of adsorbate stability and reaction kinetics.

Ni/Pt双金属表面通过在单晶Pt（111）或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成，其表征通常采用低能电子衍射（LEED）、AES（奥尔逊电子能谱）和脱附光谱等方法。这些方法对于结构建模、DFT（密度泛函理论）计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。沉积过程允许创建具有特定组成和结构的表面，这些表面与它们的纯金属对应物相比可能表现出独特的性质。表征有助于阐明Ni和Pt层之间的相互作用、原子排列以及这些如何影响整体表面化学和反应性，尤其是吸附剂稳定性及反应动力学。
