[1] "The presence of Pt in the second layer leads to electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer."
[2] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[3] "This activation energy corresponds to the formate stability on a mixed CuPt bimetallic site."

[1] "Room temperature deposition of Pt on Cu(100) has been studied by LEED, AES and desorption spectroscopy indicating that sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K leads to formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters."
[2] "In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection requires thermal activation which leads to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer below a copper monolayer."
[3] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[4] "Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1."
[5] "Thus, the surface chemistry of Pt in Cu3Pt alloys differs significantly from that of pure Pt resulting in a much increased stability for the formate intermediate."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is typically conducted through techniques such as LEED (Low-Energy Electron Diffraction), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), and desorption spectroscopy. These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition process allows for the creation of surfaces with specific compositions and structures that can exhibit unique properties compared to their pure metal counterparts. The characterization helps in elucidating the interactions between the Ni and Pt layers, their atomic arrangements, and how these affect the overall surface chemistry and reactivity, particularly in terms of adsorbate stability and reaction kinetics.
