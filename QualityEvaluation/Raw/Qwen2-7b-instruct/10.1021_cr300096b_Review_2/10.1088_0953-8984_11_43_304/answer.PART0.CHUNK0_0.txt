[1] "The presence of Pt in the second layer leads to electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer."
[2] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[3] "This activation energy corresponds to the formate stability on a mixed CuPt bimetallic site."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It enables researchers to understand the unique behavior of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis applications.
