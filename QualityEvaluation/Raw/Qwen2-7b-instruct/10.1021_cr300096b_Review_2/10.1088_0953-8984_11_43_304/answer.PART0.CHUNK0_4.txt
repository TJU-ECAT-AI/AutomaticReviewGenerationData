[1] "Room temperature deposition of Pt on Cu(100) has been studied by LEED, AES and desorption spectroscopy indicating that sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K leads to formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters."
[2] "In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection requires thermal activation which leads to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer below a copper monolayer."
[3] "The presence of Pt in the second layer leads to electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer."
[4] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[5] "Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1."
