[1] "Room temperature deposition of Pt on Cu(100) has been studied by LEED, AES and desorption spectroscopy indicating that sub-monolayer Pt growth at 300 K leads to formation of a poorly ordered c(2 × 2) surface alloy co-adsorbed with Pt microclusters."
[2] "In contrast to the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pd system, a high degree of crystalline perfection requires thermal activation which leads to surface Pt atoms switching to second layer sub-surface sites to form a c(2 × 2) underlayer below a copper monolayer."
[3] "The presence of Pt in the second layer leads to electronic perturbation of the outermost copper monolayer."
[4] "Formic acid adsorption on the Cu(100)-c(2 × 2)-Pt sub-surface alloy leads to formation of a formate intermediate with reduced stability relative to clean Cu(100) signalled by a 30 K downward shift in the simultaneous CO2/H2 evolution."
[5] "Thicker Pt films with Pt coverages of 1 ML up to 2.5 ML containing significant quantities of Pt in the outermost layer in a local c(2 × 2) environment lead to an additional downward shift in the formate decomposition temperature to 406 K corresponding to a decomposition activation energy of 104 kJ mol-1."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through techniques such as LEED (Low Energy Electron Diffraction), AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), and desorption spectroscopy. These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process allows researchers to analyze the surface structure, composition, and interactions between the Ni and Pt layers, which are essential for optimizing their performance in various applications, including catalysis.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来合成，通过LEED（低能电子衍射）、AES（俄歇电子能谱）和脱附光谱等技术进行。这些方法对于结构建模、DFT（密度泛函理论）计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中全面理解Ni和Pt层之间的电子和化学性质至关重要。该过程允许研究人员分析表面结构、组成及其相互作用，这对于优化其在各种应用中的性能（包括催化）非常重要。
