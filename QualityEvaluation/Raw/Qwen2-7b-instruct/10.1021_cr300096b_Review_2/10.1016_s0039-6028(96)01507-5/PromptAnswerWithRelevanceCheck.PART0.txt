[1] "Metal-on-metal growth can be viewed as a competition between, on the one hand, energetic factors favouring a structure that minimises the free energy of the whole system and, on the other hand, kinetic factors that control and limit the rate of the various diffusion processes."
[2] "Cu/Pt is a noble metal system with 8% lattice mismatch and negligible bulk diffusion at 340 K."
[3] "For the STM measurements, the sample was cleaned using cycles of argon sputtering at 800 K, annealing at 1100 K and annealing at 800 K in 1 x 10^-6 mbar oxygen atmosphere."
[4] "The HAS was carried out with a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion (2% energy resolution) and directed onto the sample, covering an area of 1 mm2."
[5] "In this paper, we report the results of experiments on the heteroepitaxial growth of Cu on Pt(111) at 340 K, from the submonolayer regime up to 25 ML."
[6] "Our results show no reconstruction during the growth of the first copper layer at a growth temperature of 340 K."
[7] "The growth in the first layer proceeds pseudomorphically, and is dominated by diffusion along surface steps, which controls both the initial nucleation of copper islands and the subsequent development and coalescence of the islands."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and helium atom scattering (HAS) allows for detailed examination of the growth patterns and surface morphologies of these bimetallic layers. The specific conditions under which the Ni monolayer is deposited, such as the annealing temperatures and oxygen atmosphere, play a significant role in determining the properties of the resulting bimetallic surface. The lack of reconstruction during the growth of the first copper layer at 340 K suggests that the growth process is controlled by diffusion along surface steps, which influences the initial nucleation and subsequent development of copper islands. This understanding is essential for predicting and optimizing the performance of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces in catalytic applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和氦原子散射（HAS）等技术，可以对这些双金属层的生长模式和表面形态进行详细分析。沉积Ni单层的具体条件，如退火温度和氧气气氛，对最终得到的双金属表面的性质有重大影响。在340 K下生长的第一铜层没有重建表明，生长过程受到沿表面台阶的扩散控制，这影响了铜岛的初始核化和后续发展。这种理解对于预测和优化Ni/Pt双金属表面在催化应用中的性能至关重要。

[1] "The growth of ultra thin Cu films (up to 25 ML) on Pt( 111) at a substrate temperature of 340 K has been investigated using helium atom scattering (HAS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)."
[2] "For the STM measurements, the sample was cleaned using cycles of argon sputtering at 800 K, annealing at 1100 K and annealing at 800 K in 1 x lop6 mbar oxygen atmosphere."
[3] "The HAS was carried out with a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion (2% energy resolution) and directed onto the sample, covering an area of 1 mm2."
[4] "The remaining part of this paper will concentrate on the growth of the first monolayer. The growth structure in this regime is in quasi-equilibrium."
[5] "After deposition of 0.25 ML (Fig. 3a) the Cu adatoms have formed branched islands mainly nucleated on lower terrace step edges."
[6] "The width of the island branches is of the order 100-200 A which is comparable to the widths found for Au growth on Ru(0001) [g-11] and Ag growth on Pt( 111) [ 121 around room temperature."
[7] "There are three possible mechanisms: first, crossing a Cu-Pt step with incorporation on a vacant lower terrace site;second, crossing the line of a pre-existing substrate 1 step from the Cu island to a vacant Pt terrace;third, crossing a Cu-Cu step along the line of a former substrate step."
[8] "However, closer inspection of Fig. 3b (inset) reveals the presence of holes, about 30 A in diameter with a density between 5 x lo- and 1 x low4 holes A-."
[9] "The holes are still visible as the second layer is forming. This is because their area is so small that there is a higher probability of adatoms meeting on Cu-covered terraces and forming homogeneously a new second layer nucleus than of them filling a hole."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves the use of techniques such as helium atom scattering (HAS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The HAS method utilizes a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion to probe the surface, while STM provides detailed images of the surface morphology. These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. For instance, the HAS technique allows for the monitoring of changes in surface morphology in real-time during the deposition process. STM images reveal the formation of branched islands nucleated on lower terrace step edges, with the width of the island branches comparable to those found in other metal growth studies. The presence of holes in the first Cu layer, with diameters around 30 Å and densities between 5 × 10−4 and 1 × 10−4 holes per square angstrom, indicates incomplete coalescence of the islands, which can affect the properties of the bimetallic surface.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来合成，涉及使用技术如氦原子散射（HAS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）。HAS方法利用由超声波扩展产生的70meV氦束来探测表面，而STM提供了表面形态的详细图像。这些方法对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。例如，HAS技术允许实时监控沉积过程中的表面形态变化。STM图像揭示了在较低台阶边缘核化的树枝状岛屿的形成，岛边宽度与其他金属生长研究中发现的宽度相似。第一层Cu层中出现孔洞，直径约为30 Å，密度在每平方埃范围内的5×10−4到1×10−4孔之间，这表明岛屿未完全合并，可能会影响双金属表面的性质。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of techniques such as helium atom scattering (HAS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) allows researchers to observe the growth patterns and morphologies of the deposited layers, including the formation of strain-relieving dislocations and the nucleation of islands on the surface. The decreasing surface height from top to bottom in the STM images indicates the directional growth of the material. The absence of nucleation at certain steps suggests that growth occurs at specific sites where there is a combination of Ni and Pt atoms, affecting the overall structure and properties of the bimetallic surface.
