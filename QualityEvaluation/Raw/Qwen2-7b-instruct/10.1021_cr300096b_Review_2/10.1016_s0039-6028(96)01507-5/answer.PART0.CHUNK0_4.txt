[1] "In this paper we report the results of experiments on the heteroepitaxial growth of Cu on Pt( 111) at 340 K,from the submonolayer regime up to 25 ML. The main emphasis is on the microscopic nucleation and diffusion processes occurring during the growth of the first monolayer."
[2] "The growth in the first layer proceeds pseudomorphically,and is dominated by diffusion along surface steps, which controls both the initial nucleation of copper islands and the subsequent development and coalescence of the islands."
[3] "After deposition of 0.25 ML (Fig. 3a) the Cu adatoms have formed branched islands mainly nucleated on lower terrace step edges."
[4] "There is no preferred orientation of the growth direction."
[5] "The width of the island branches is of the order 100-200 A which is comparable to the widths found for Au growth on Ru(0001) [g-11] and Ag growth on Pt( 111) [ 121 around room temperature."
[6] "However, closer inspection of Fig. 3b (inset) reveals the presence of holes, about 30 A in diameter with a density between 5 x lo- and 1 x low4 holes A-."
[7] "They originate from growing islands which have not completely coalesced. The holes are still visible as the second layer is forming."
[8] "They act as diffuse scatterers [7] and hence prevent the He intensity from reaching its initial value at completion of the first monolayer."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. During the growth of the first monolayer, the process is dominated by diffusion along surface steps, controlling the initial nucleation of copper islands and their subsequent development and coalescence. Branched islands form mainly nucleated on lower terrace step edges with no preferred orientation of the growth direction. The width of the island branches is comparable to the widths found for Au growth on Ru(0001) and Ag growth on Pt(111) around room temperature. Holes, about 30 Å in diameter, appear in the first layer due to incomplete coalescence of growing islands. These holes act as diffuse scatterers, preventing the helium intensity from reaching its initial value at the completion of the first monolayer.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面了解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质至关重要。在第一单层的生长过程中，过程由沿表面台阶的扩散主导，控制着铜岛的初始核化及其后续的发展和融合。分支状岛屿主要在较低台阶边缘处形成，没有特定的生长方向偏好。岛屿宽度与Au在Ru(0001)上的生长和Ag在Pt(111)上的生长在室温下的宽度相仿。在第一层中出现直径约为30 Å的孔洞，这是由于生长岛屿未完全融合而产生的。这些孔洞作为散射体，阻止氦强度达到第一单层完成时的初始值。
