[1] "The growth of ultra thin Cu films (up to 25 ML) on Pt( 111) at a substrate temperature of 340 K has been investigated using helium atom scattering (HAS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)."
[2] "For the STM measurements, the sample was cleaned using cycles of argon sputtering at 800 K, annealing at 1100 K and annealing at 800 K in 1 x lop6 mbar oxygen atmosphere."
[3] "The HAS was carried out with a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion (2% energy resolution) and directed onto the sample, covering an area of 1 mm2."
[4] "The remaining part of this paper will concentrate on the growth of the first monolayer. The growth structure in this regime is in quasi-equilibrium."
[5] "After deposition of 0.25 ML (Fig. 3a) the Cu adatoms have formed branched islands mainly nucleated on lower terrace step edges."
[6] "The width of the island branches is of the order 100-200 A which is comparable to the widths found for Au growth on Ru(0001) [g-11] and Ag growth on Pt( 111) [ 121 around room temperature."
[7] "There are three possible mechanisms: first, crossing a Cu-Pt step with incorporation on a vacant lower terrace site;second, crossing the line of a pre-existing substrate 1 step from the Cu island to a vacant Pt terrace;third, crossing a Cu-Cu step along the line of a former substrate step."
[8] "However, closer inspection of Fig. 3b (inset) reveals the presence of holes, about 30 A in diameter with a density between 5 x lo- and 1 x low4 holes A-."
[9] "The holes are still visible as the second layer is forming. This is because their area is so small that there is a higher probability of adatoms meeting on Cu-covered terraces and forming homogeneously a new second layer nucleus than of them filling a hole."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves the use of techniques such as helium atom scattering (HAS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The HAS method utilizes a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion to probe the surface, while STM provides detailed images of the surface morphology. These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. For instance, the HAS technique allows for the monitoring of changes in surface morphology in real-time during the deposition process. STM images reveal the formation of branched islands nucleated on lower terrace step edges, with the width of the island branches comparable to those found in other metal growth studies. The presence of holes in the first Cu layer, with diameters around 30 Å and densities between 5 × 10−4 and 1 × 10−4 holes per square angstrom, indicates incomplete coalescence of the islands, which can affect the properties of the bimetallic surface.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来合成，涉及使用技术如氦原子散射（HAS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）。HAS方法利用由超声波扩展产生的70meV氦束来探测表面，而STM提供了表面形态的详细图像。这些方法对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。例如，HAS技术允许实时监控沉积过程中的表面形态变化。STM图像揭示了在较低台阶边缘核化的树枝状岛屿的形成，岛边宽度与其他金属生长研究中发现的宽度相似。第一层Cu层中出现孔洞，直径约为30 Å，密度在每平方埃范围内的5×10−4到1×10−4孔之间，这表明岛屿未完全合并，可能会影响双金属表面的性质。
