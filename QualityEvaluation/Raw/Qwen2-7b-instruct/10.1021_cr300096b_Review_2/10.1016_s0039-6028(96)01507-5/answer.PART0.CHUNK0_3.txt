[1] "The HAS was carried out with a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion (2% energy resolution) and directed onto the sample,covering an area of 1 mm2."
[2] "A high specular intensity arises from a mirror-like surface, while steps and adatoms reduce the intensity, as does any atomic scale corrugation on a growing layer."
[3] "Interpretation of scattering data in the first monolayer region (magnified in the inset of Fig. 1) Fig. 2. Image (48 x 48 nm) of a 2 ML Cu film grown at 340 K showing the formation of a strain relieving dislocation network."
[4] "In both images the absolute surface height decreases from the top to the bottom of the image (direction of down-steps of the Pt substrate)."
[5] "There is no preferred orientation of the growth direction."
[6] "The absence of nucleation at Cu-Cu steps implies that growth is taking place at other sites,which must have copper on the upper terrace and Pt on the lower (Cu-Pt steps)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of techniques such as helium atom scattering (HAS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) allows researchers to observe the growth patterns and morphologies of the deposited layers, including the formation of strain-relieving dislocations and the nucleation of islands on the surface. The decreasing surface height from top to bottom in the STM images indicates the directional growth of the material. The absence of nucleation at certain steps suggests that growth occurs at specific sites where there is a combination of Ni and Pt atoms, affecting the overall structure and properties of the bimetallic surface.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对高级表面科学和催化研究中的双金属表面的电子和化学性质的理解至关重要。通过使用诸如氦原子散射（HAS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）等技术，研究人员能够观察沉积层的生长模式和形态，包括应力缓解位错的形成和表面上岛状结构的核化。STM图像中表面高度从顶部到底部的递减表明材料的定向生长。在某些步骤上没有核化现象的存在暗示了生长发生在特定的位置，其中包含Ni和Pt原子，这影响了双金属表面的整体结构和性质。
