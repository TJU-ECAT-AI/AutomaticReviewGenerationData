[1] "Metal-on-metal growth can be viewed as a competition between, on the one hand, energetic factors favouring a structure that minimises the free energy of the whole system and, on the other hand, kinetic factors that control and limit the rate of the various diffusion processes."
[2] "Cu/Pt is a noble metal system with 8% lattice mismatch and negligible bulk diffusion at 340 K."
[3] "For the STM measurements, the sample was cleaned using cycles of argon sputtering at 800 K, annealing at 1100 K and annealing at 800 K in 1 x 10^-6 mbar oxygen atmosphere."
[4] "The HAS was carried out with a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion (2% energy resolution) and directed onto the sample, covering an area of 1 mm2."
[5] "In this paper, we report the results of experiments on the heteroepitaxial growth of Cu on Pt(111) at 340 K, from the submonolayer regime up to 25 ML."
[6] "Our results show no reconstruction during the growth of the first copper layer at a growth temperature of 340 K."
[7] "The growth in the first layer proceeds pseudomorphically, and is dominated by diffusion along surface steps, which controls both the initial nucleation of copper islands and the subsequent development and coalescence of the islands."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and helium atom scattering (HAS) allows for detailed examination of the growth patterns and surface morphologies of these bimetallic layers. The specific conditions under which the Ni monolayer is deposited, such as the annealing temperatures and oxygen atmosphere, play a significant role in determining the properties of the resulting bimetallic surface. The lack of reconstruction during the growth of the first copper layer at 340 K suggests that the growth process is controlled by diffusion along surface steps, which influences the initial nucleation and subsequent development of copper islands. This understanding is essential for predicting and optimizing the performance of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces in catalytic applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。使用扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和氦原子散射（HAS）等技术，可以对这些双金属层的生长模式和表面形态进行详细分析。沉积Ni单层的具体条件，如退火温度和氧气气氛，对最终得到的双金属表面的性质有重大影响。在340 K下生长的第一铜层没有重建表明，生长过程受到沿表面台阶的扩散控制，这影响了铜岛的初始核化和后续发展。这种理解对于预测和优化Ni/Pt双金属表面在催化应用中的性能至关重要。
