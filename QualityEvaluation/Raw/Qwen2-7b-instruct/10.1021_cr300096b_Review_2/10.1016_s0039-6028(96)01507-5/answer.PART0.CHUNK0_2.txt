[1] "The HAS was carried out with a 70 meV helium beam produced by supersonic expansion (2% energy resolution) and directed onto the sample,covering an area of 1 mm2."
[2] "The absence of any oscillations in the He intensity curve points to a 3D growth mode."
[3] "In both images the absolute surface height decreases from the top to the bottom of the image (direction of down-steps of the Pt substrate)."
[4] "There is no preferred orientation of the growth direction."
[5] "The fact that no second layer islands are visible in Fig. 3b shows that adatoms arriving on the Cu film can escape easily and incorporate at the growth front of the first layer."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The HAS method utilizes a 70 meV helium beam with 2% energy resolution to probe the surfaces. The 3D growth mode is indicated by the absence of oscillations in the He intensity curve. The absolute surface height decreases from the top to the bottom of the images, reflecting the growth direction. There is no preferred orientation of the growth direction. The fact that no second layer islands are visible suggests that adatoms can easily escape and incorporate at the growth front of the first layer.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。利用具有2%能量分辨率的70meV氦束的HAS方法来探测表面。He强度曲线中不存在振荡表明存在三维生长模式。绝对表面高度从顶部到底部图像的底部递减，反映了生长方向。没有特定的生长方向偏好。没有第二层岛屿可见的事实表明，可以轻松地逃离并整合到第一层生长前沿的表面。
