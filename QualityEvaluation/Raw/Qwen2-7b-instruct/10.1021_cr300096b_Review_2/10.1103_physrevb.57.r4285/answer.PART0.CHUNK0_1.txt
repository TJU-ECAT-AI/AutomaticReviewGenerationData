The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves the study of their structure, electronic properties, and chemical behavior. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows scientists to understand the interactions and functionalities of these surfaces at the atomic level. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, this detailed knowledge helps in designing more efficient catalysts and predicting their performance under various conditions.
