[1] "The aim of the present work is to use Ionization Spectroscopy for the non-destructive study of the layer-by-layer composition of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) surface as a function of the heating temperature."
[2] "The distinct diffraction spots from the clean (1 1 1) surface form a regular hexagon, pointing at the (1  1) bulk-like structure."
[3] "At room temperature, the (1 1 1) surface of the Pt80Co20 alloy is enriched to pure platinum, and shows an oscillating concentration profile up to the sixth atomic layer."
[4] "The first atomic layer also consists of pure Pt with bulk concentration in other layers."
[5] "The lattice parameter in the g phase, extracted from X-ray measurements, is in close agreement with the tabulated value a = 3.855 A and interlayer distance 2.226 A."
[6] "The distinct diffraction spots from the clean (1 1 1) surface form a regular hexagon, pointing at the (1  1) bulk-like structure."
[7] "The first atomic layer still consists of pure Pt up to 873 K."
[8] "At lower temperatures, a surface composition of 100% Pt is observed in the IS experiments and this is confirmed by MC simulations."
[9] "Considerable differences between the simulations and the experiments are observed for the second and third atomic layers."
[10] "The discrepancy between MC/CBE simulations and the experimental results must be ascribed to driving forces that are not included in the CBE model."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows for the precise control and examination of the interaction and arrangement of Ni and Pt atoms, which is fundamental to understanding their reactivity and performance in catalytic applications.
