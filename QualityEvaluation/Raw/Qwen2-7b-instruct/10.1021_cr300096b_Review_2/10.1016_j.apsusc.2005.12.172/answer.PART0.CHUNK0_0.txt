[1] "A single-crystal sample of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) alloy was investigated in an UHV chamber equipped with electron and ion guns and with a four-grid LEED optics with an energy resolution of 0.3% [14]."
[2] "The distinct diffraction spots from the clean (1 1 1) surface form a regular hexagon, pointing at the (1  1) bulk-like structure."
[3] "In the ordered phase, Pt80Co20 is very similar to the stoichiometric phase Pt3Co, the excess Pt concentration being randomly distributed on the cobalt sublattice."
[4] "The aim of the present work is to use Ionization Spectroscopy for the non-destructive study of the layer-by-layer composition of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) surface as a function of the heating temperature."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the creation of precisely controlled interfaces that can influence reactivity and selectivity in catalytic applications. The specific arrangement and interaction of Ni and Pt atoms at the interface determine the properties of the resulting bimetallic surface, making this deposition process essential for tailoring the surface for desired functionalities.
