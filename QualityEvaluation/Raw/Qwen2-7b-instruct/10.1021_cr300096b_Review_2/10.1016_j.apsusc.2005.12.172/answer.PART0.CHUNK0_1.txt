[1] "In recent years several non-destructive methods have been used for surface analysis."
[2] "The aim of the present work is to use Ionization Spectroscopy for the non-destructive study of the layer-by-layer composition of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) surface as a function of the heating temperature."
[3] "The present paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reports on the experiment and the characterization of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) surface, Section 3 describes the physical basis of Ionization Spectroscopy, the layer-by-layer reconstruction methods and the IS analysis."
[4] "The distinct diffraction spots from the clean (1 1 1) surface form a regular hexagon, pointing at the (1  1) bulk-like structure."
[5] "At room temperature, the (1 1 1) surface of the Pt80Co20 alloy is enriched to pure platinum, and shows an oscillating concentration profile up to the sixth atomic layer."
[6] "For the ordered state the first atomic layer also consists of pure Pt with bulk concentration in other layers."
[7] "The lattice parameter in the g phase, extracted from X-ray measurements, is in close agreement with the tabulated value a = 3.855 A and interlayer distance 2.226 A."
[8] "In the ordered phase, Pt80Co20 is very similar to the stoichiometric phase Pt3Co, the excess Pt concentration being randomly distributed on the cobalt sublattice."
[9] "The distinct diffraction spots from the clean (1 1 1) surface form a regular hexagon, pointing at the (1  1) bulk-like structure."
[10] "In the process of ordering at Pt80Co20(1 1 1) the lattice parameter will decrease in comparison to the disordered state and then the enrichment of the first layer in platinum will favor the formation of the surface p(2  2) structure."
[11] "In the framework of the CBE model, the energy of a configuration X (EX) is calculated as a sum of pairwise atomic contributions (Ei)"
[12] "In exactly stoichiometric ordered compounds, this elastic strain energy is negligible, as the lattice parameter of the compound has adjusted to the ordered stacking."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a combination of experimental techniques including low energy ion scattering, low energy electron diffraction, and ionization spectroscopy. This process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The experimental methods provide insights into the atomic structure, composition, and bonding characteristics of the bimetallic interfaces, enabling detailed analysis of the interaction between the Ni and Pt layers. This information is essential for predicting the reactivity, stability, and performance of these surfaces in catalytic applications.
