[1] "In this paper, a method of Ionization Spectroscopy (IS) is proposed for the non-destructive layer-by-layer analysis of the elemental composition of a solid surface."
[2] "The aim of the present work is to use Ionization Spectroscopy for the non-destructive in-depth analysis of the surface composition of Pt80Co20(1 1 1)."
[3] "The calculation of the contribution to the intensity of an IL by the electrons having lost an amount of energy DEb at the depth Z from the sample surface by the ionization of the core states of the atoms b is simple when a traditional experimental configuration is used (an incident beam of the primary electrons is directed perpendicularly to the sample surface (u0 = 0) and the secondary electrons are registered at the angle u with respect to the normal)."
[4] "In the following sections, methods are presented for building the solution of Eq. (9) and for the numerical calculation of the concentration profiles within the framework of the described model."
[5] "The discrepancy between MC/CBE simulations and the experimental results must be ascribed to driving forces that are not included in the CBE model."

1. The paper introduces Ionization Spectroscopy as a non-destructive technique for analyzing the elemental composition layer by layer on a solid surface.
2. The objective of the current study is to employ Ionization Spectroscopy for the non-invasive investigation of the surface composition of the Pt80Co20(1 1 1) alloy.
3. When utilizing a conventional experimental setup (where primary electrons strike the sample surface perpendicular to it and secondary electrons are detected at an angle 'u' relative to the normal), the impact of electrons losing energy 'DEb' at a depth 'Z' from the surface through core level ionization of atoms 'b' can be easily calculated.
4. Various methodologies are outlined in the document for solving Equation (9) and computing concentration profiles in binary alloys within the context of the described theoretical framework.
5. The differences observed between Monte Carlo simulations with the Constant Bond Energy model and experimental findings can be attributed to forces not accounted for within the CBE model.
