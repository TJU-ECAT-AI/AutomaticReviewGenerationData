The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxygen-induced segregation of 3d metals in Pt. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it aids in comprehending the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Specifically, the predicted effect of crystal plane on oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and the effect of crystal plane on the stability of the subsurface structure are key aspects that contribute to our comprehensive understanding.
