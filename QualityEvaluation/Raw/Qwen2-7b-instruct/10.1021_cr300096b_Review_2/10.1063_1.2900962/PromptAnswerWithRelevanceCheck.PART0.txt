1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves creating these surfaces through deposition techniques. This process is crucial because it allows for the precise control of the surface structure, which in turn affects the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. These properties are essential for understanding phenomena such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The stability of PtNiPt and PtCoPt subsurface structures on Pt foil exposed to oxygen is determined experimentally. This process helps in assessing how these bimetallic structures behave under oxidative conditions, providing insights into their durability and functionality in catalytic applications.
3. The predicted effect of the crystal plane on ORR activity suggests that the orientation of the Pt surface can significantly influence its catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reactions. Different crystal planes may exhibit varying reactivity due to differences in adsorption energies of reactants or products, affecting the overall efficiency of the ORR.
4. The effect of crystal plane on subsurface stability indicates that the arrangement of atoms beneath the surface layer can be influenced by the underlying crystal structure. This has implications for the long-term stability and reactivity of bimetallic catalysts, as the subsurface region can play a crucial role in determining the material's overall performance and durability.
