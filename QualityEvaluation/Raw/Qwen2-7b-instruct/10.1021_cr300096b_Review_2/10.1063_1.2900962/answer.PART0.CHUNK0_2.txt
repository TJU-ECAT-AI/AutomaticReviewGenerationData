1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves creating these surfaces through deposition techniques. This process is crucial because it allows for the precise control of the surface structure, which in turn affects the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. These properties are essential for understanding phenomena such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, which is critical in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The stability of PtNiPt and PtCoPt subsurface structures on Pt foil exposed to oxygen is determined experimentally. This process helps in assessing how these bimetallic structures behave under oxidative conditions, providing insights into their durability and functionality in catalytic applications.
3. The predicted effect of the crystal plane on ORR activity suggests that the orientation of the Pt surface can significantly influence its catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reactions. Different crystal planes may exhibit varying reactivity due to differences in adsorption energies of reactants or products, affecting the overall efficiency of the ORR.
4. The effect of crystal plane on subsurface stability indicates that the arrangement of atoms beneath the surface layer can be influenced by the underlying crystal structure. This has implications for the long-term stability and reactivity of bimetallic catalysts, as the subsurface region can play a crucial role in determining the material's overall performance and durability.

1. 尼/铂双金属表面的表征涉及通过沉积技术在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶铂基板上沉积Ni单层。这个过程至关重要，因为它允许对表面结构进行精确控制，进而影响双金属表面的电子和化学性质。这些性质对于理解诸如氧还原反应（ORR）活性等现象至关重要，在先进表面科学和催化研究中非常重要。
2. PtNiPt和PtCoPt的亚表面结构在氧气暴露下的稳定性是通过实验确定的。这一过程有助于评估这些双金属结构在氧化条件下的行为，提供了它们耐久性和功能性的见解，这对于催化应用尤为重要。
3. 预测的晶面效应表明，铂表面的取向可以显著影响其在氧还原反应中的催化性能。不同的晶面可能因反应物或产物吸附能的不同而表现出不同的活性，从而影响整体ORR效率。
4. 晶面效应对亚表面稳定性的影响表明，亚表面区域的原子排列可以受到底层晶体结构的影响。这对于材料的整体性能和耐用性具有重要影响，因为亚表面区域可以在决定材料性能和使用寿命方面发挥关键作用。
