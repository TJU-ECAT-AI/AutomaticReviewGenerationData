Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves a series of steps crucial for structural modeling and detailed understanding of the surfaces' properties. This process includes the use of density functional theory calculations and experimental techniques to analyze the surfaces. The synthesis process itself is significant as it enables the creation of specific surface structures that are essential for understanding their behavior under various conditions. These surfaces are of great importance in advanced surface science and catalysis research due to their unique properties.
