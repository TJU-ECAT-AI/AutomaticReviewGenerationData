[1] "The higher subsurface Pt concentrations observed for Pt growth on the Cu(12 12 11) surface suggests that intermixing of Pt and Cu in the first two surface layers is mediated by surface steps."
[2] "Indeed, it is possible to speculate that the difference between the MEIS results presented here and the LEIS results reported previously for Pt/Cu(1 1 1) originates from residual steps on our nominally flat Cu(1 1 1) surface."
[3] "Step mediated intermixing has been observed previously in both the Ag/Pt(1 1 1) and Ni/Pt(1 1 1) systems."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and low energy ion scattering (LEIS) techniques. These methods are crucial for understanding the structural and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. The step-mediated intermixing process, which allows Pt and Ni atoms to move between the surface layers, is particularly important for structural modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This process helps researchers gain insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, which are vital for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层合成，使用中能离子散射（MEIS）和低能离子散射（LEIS）技术进行。这些方法对于理解双金属表面的结构和化学性质至关重要。步骤介导的混合过程，允许Pt和Ni原子在表面层之间移动，对于结构建模和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算尤为重要。这个过程有助于研究人员深入了解这些表面的电子和化学性质，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
