<p>In order to understand further the role of surface steps during deposition and alloying, a vicinal Cu(12 12 11) surface was also investigated.</p>
<p>There are distinct differences between the data of Fig. 3, Fig. 4 that must be attributable to the presence of surface steps.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is possible to speculate that the difference between the MEIS results presented here and the LEIS results reported previously for Pt/Cu(1 1 1) originates from residual steps on our nominally flat Cu(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>The higher subsurface Pt concentrations observed for Pt growth on the Cu(12 12 11) surface suggests that intermixing of Pt and Cu in the first two surface layers is mediated by surface steps.</p>

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted by examining the surface properties through various analytical techniques such as medium energy ion scattering (MEIS). This process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The differences between the characterization results of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces grown on a Cu(111) single crystal versus a Cu(12 12 11) vicinal surface indicate the influence of surface steps on the intermixing process. Surface steps mediate the intermixing of Ni and Pt, leading to distinct surface alloy compositions and structures.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来合成，其表征过程通常涉及使用各种分析技术，如中能离子散射（MEIS），以研究表面性质。这一过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及深入了解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质至关重要。
2. 在Cu(111)单晶与Cu(12 12 11)斜面表面之间生长的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征结果之间的差异表明表面台阶对混合过程的影响。表面台阶介导Ni和Pt的混合，导致不同的表面合金组成和结构。
