<p>In order to understand further the role of surface steps during deposition and alloying, a vicinal Cu(12 12 11) surface was also investigated.</p>
<p>There are distinct differences between the data of Fig. 3, Fig. 4 that must be attributable to the presence of surface steps.</p>
<p>Indeed, it is possible to speculate that the difference between the MEIS results presented here and the LEIS results reported previously for Pt/Cu(1 1 1) originates from residual steps on our nominally flat Cu(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>The higher subsurface Pt concentrations observed for Pt growth on the Cu(12 12 11) surface suggests that intermixing of Pt and Cu in the first two surface layers is mediated by surface steps.</p>

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted by examining the surface properties through various analytical techniques such as medium energy ion scattering (MEIS). This process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The differences between the characterization results of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces grown on a Cu(111) single crystal versus a Cu(12 12 11) vicinal surface indicate the influence of surface steps on the intermixing process. Surface steps mediate the intermixing of Ni and Pt, leading to distinct surface alloy compositions and structures.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the interface between the two metals. The formation of surface steps on the Pt substrate plays a significant role in mediating the intermixing of Ni and Pt atoms, particularly on Cu(12 12 11) surfaces where higher subsurface Ni concentrations suggest step-mediated intermixing. This mechanism facilitates the incorporation of Pt into the second layer, potentially through direct exchange of atoms at step edges or migration of Cu atoms across the upper terrace and down the CuPt step. Understanding these processes is essential for predicting and optimizing the properties of bimetallic catalysts and for developing accurate models of their behavior in catalytic reactions.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，特别是在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下。这是因为这允许对两种金属之间的界面进行精确控制。在Pt基底上形成的表面台阶对Ni和Pt原子的混合起着重要作用，特别是对于Cu(12 12 11)表面，在这种表面上观察到较高的Ni亚表面浓度，表明台阶介导的混合。这一机制使得Pt原子能够被整合到第二层中，可能通过台阶边缘处的原子直接交换或迁移Cu原子穿过上层平台并沿CuPt台阶向下占据周围Cu原子周围的邻近位点。理解这些过程对于预测和优化双金属催化剂的性能以及开发其催化反应行为的准确模型至关重要。
