[1] "Indeed, it is possible to speculate that the difference between the MEIS results presented here and the LEIS results reported previously for Pt/Cu(1 1 1) originates from residual steps on our nominally flat Cu(1 1 1) surface."
[2] "The higher subsurface Pt concentrations observed for Pt growth on the Cu(12 12 11) surface suggests that intermixing of Pt and Cu in the first two surface layers is mediated by surface steps."
[3] "The mechanism for the formation of precursor alloy necessarily involves Pt transport from the surface layer into the second layer. The evidence presented here suggests that residual steps could explain the difference between our work and the previous LEIS measurements."
[4] "In summary, we have shown that the growth of platinum on a Cu(1 1 1) surface involves the formation of a step mediated precursor alloy of platinum and copper that is restricted to the top two surface layers."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a series of experiments that involve the use of medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and low energy ion scattering (LEIS) techniques. These methods allow researchers to analyze the structure and composition of the bimetallic surfaces at various temperatures. The process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The findings contribute significantly to advanced surface science and catalysis research by providing insights into the behavior of these materials under different conditions.
