<p>However, the observation of intermixed PtCu region that is restricted to the top two layers for the growth of Pt/Cu(1 1 1) at 200 K has not been reported previously.</p>
<p>The mechanism for the formation of precursor alloy necessarily involves Pt transport from the surface layer into the second layer. The evidence presented here suggests that residual steps could explain the difference between our work and the previous LEIS measurements.</p>
<p>Once incorporated into the second layer, the formation of a uniform precursor alloy necessarily means that each subsurface Pt atom must travel a substantial distance within the terrace and away from the step edge.</p>
<p>These step bunches could further facilitate the incorporation of Pt into the second layer by the diffusion of copper atoms across the upper terrace and then down the CuPt step to occupy neighbouring sites surrounding the Cu atoms.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves observing the formation of a precursor alloy of platinum and copper that is restricted to the top two surface layers. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it reveals how the metals interact at the interface, affecting their reactivity and stability. The mechanism of precursor alloy formation involves Pt transport from the surface layer into the second layer, facilitated by the presence of surface steps. These steps allow for the diffusion of copper atoms across the upper terrace and down the CuPt step to incorporate Pt into the second layer, which is essential for comprehending the structural and functional aspects of these bimetallic systems.

合成Ni/Pt双金属表面，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积一层Ni单层，其表征涉及观察铂和铜组成的前体合金的形成，该合金局限于顶层两个表面层。这一过程对于理解高级表面科学和催化研究中这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它揭示了金属在界面处的相互作用方式，影响它们的活性和稳定性。前体合金形成的机制涉及铂从表面层向第二层的传输，由表面台阶的存在所促进。这些台阶允许铜原子在上层台阶上扩散，并沿着CuPt台阶向下移动，以在Cu原子周围的相邻位置插入铂，这对于理解这些双金属体系的结构和功能特性至关重要。
