[1] "Recently, the Pd- or Pt-covered W(111) has been found to undergo a faceting transition upon annealing the surface above a transition temperature, 750 K [ 1-3 ]."
[2] "As the surface is annealed above 750 K, the W substrate undergoes a faceting reconstruction, and three-sided pyramids with Pd- or Pt-covered W(211) faces are formed on the surface (cf. Fig. la)."
[3] "The driving force for this faceting transition is believed to be related to the crystallographic anisotropy of the surface free energy of the Pd- or Pt-covered W surface [1,4]."
[4] "Since electronic energy dominates the bonding between atoms in a solid, valence level photoelectron spectroscopy is an ideal tool to probe the electronic structure as well as the bonding of materials."
[5] "Core level photoelectron spectroscopy offers another way to probe the binding between atoms."
[6] "That is, the W atom at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface may have a different W 4f7/2 binding energy from that of a W atom at the W-vacuum interface, or in the bulk."
[7] "As the film-covered W(lll) surface is annealed to 900 K for 3 min, film-covered {211} facets develop,which are verified in situ by low energy electron diffraction."
[8] "The salient features of these spectra are the broadening of the lineshape and the shifting of the centroid of the lineshape to the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak."
[9] "Furthermore, on W(ll0), Pt is found to bond considerably more strongly than Pd [12,13]; one could expect that Pt also bonds more strongly on the {211} facets than Pd."
[10] "Unfortunately, surface energies of very few single crystal surfaces of refractory metals are available (in particular, none are available experimentally for Pd in the bcc structure)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to study the interaction between Ni and Pt layers, the formation of interfacial structures, and the resulting changes in electronic and chemical properties. By understanding these properties, scientists can design more efficient catalysts and materials for various applications, such as hydrogen storage, catalytic conversions, and energy conversion technologies.
