[1] "Recently, the Pd- or Pt-covered W(111) has been found to undergo a faceting transition upon annealing the surface above a transition temperature, 750 K [1-3 ]."
[2] "As the film-covered W(lll) surface is annealed to 900 K for 3 min, film-covered {211} facets develop,which are verified in situ by low energy electron diffraction."
[3] "The salient features of these spectra are the broadening of the lineshape and the shifting of the centroid of the lineshape to the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak."
[4] "Therefore, the bulk-like W peak observed in Figs. 2b and 3b suggests that the interface W peak at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface for the [ 111 ] face coincides with the bulk W peak."
[5] "The binding energy difference between the interface peak and the surface peak can be related to the heat of adhesion."

This document discusses the investigation of the W 4f core level shifts accompanying the adsorption of Pd or Pt adlayers on W(111) and the development of {211} facets through annealing above 750 K. The study employs high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation to analyze the changes in the core level shifts. It also explores the relation between the interface W peak binding energy and the bulk W peak, suggesting that the interface W peak at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface for the [111] face coincides with the bulk W peak. Additionally, the document introduces a method to infer the surface and interfacial energies through the analysis of core level shifts within the Born-Haber cycle framework.
