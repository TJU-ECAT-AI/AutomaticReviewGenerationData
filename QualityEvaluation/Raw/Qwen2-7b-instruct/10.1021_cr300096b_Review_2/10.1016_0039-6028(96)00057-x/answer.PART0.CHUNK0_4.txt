[1] "Recently, the Pd- or Pt-covered W(111) has been found to undergo a faceting transition upon annealing the surface above a transition temperature, 750 K [1-3 ]."
[2] "As the film-covered W(lll) surface is annealed to 900 K for 3 min, film-covered {211} facets develop,which are verified in situ by low energy electron diffraction."
[3] "The salient features of these spectra are the broadening of the lineshape and the shifting of the centroid of the lineshape to the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak."
[4] "Unfortunately, surface energies of very few single crystal surfaces of refractory metals are available (in particular, none are available experimentally for Pd in the bcc structure)."

This study investigates the W 4f core level shifts that occur when palladium (Pd) or platinum (Pt) adlayers are adsorbed onto tungsten (W) (111) surfaces. The researchers utilize high-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation to analyze the changes in the W 4f7/2 core level of W(111) before and after Pd or Pt deposition. The results show that upon adsorption of Pd or Pt at 300 K, only a bulk-like W peak is observed. The disappearance of surface and subsurface W peaks can be attributed to the removal of the vacuum-W interface at the expense of creating a Pd-W or Pt-W interface and a Pd-vacuum or Pt-vacuum interface due to the adsorbed Pd or Pt film. When the film-covered W(lll) surface is annealed to 900 K for 3 minutes, film-covered {211} facets develop, which are verified in situ by low energy electron diffraction. The corresponding W 4f/2 spectra for Pd and Pt films exhibit broadening of the lineshape and shifting of the centroid of the lineshape to the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak.

本研究探讨了当钯（Pd）或铂（Pt）吸附层被吸附到钨（W）（111）表面时，W 4f核心能级的变化。研究人员使用同步辐射光电子谱学的高分辨率光电子谱学方法来分析在W(111)表面吸附前后W的4f7/2核心能级变化。结果显示，在300 K时吸附Pd或Pt后，仅观察到一个类似于W的峰。表面和亚表面W峰向更高的结合能方向移动并与W的主体峰相吻合的原因是真空-W界面的消失，这归因于吸附的Pd或Pt薄膜形成的Pd-W或Pt-W界面以及Pd-真空或Pt-真空界面。当覆盖薄膜的W(lll)表面在900 K下退火3分钟时，形成覆盖的{211}晶面，通过低能电子衍射原位验证。对于Pd和Pt薄膜的对应W 4f/2光谱显示线型展宽和峰中心向主体W峰的较低结合能方向移动。
