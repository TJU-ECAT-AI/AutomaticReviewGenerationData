[1] "In this brief report, we present data to illustrate the potential of core level photo- electron spectroscopy for determining the ener- getics of metal-metal interfaces, and we point the direction to future experiments that address these issues."
[2] "High resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation is used to investigate the W 4f7/2 core level shifts that accompany adsorption of Pd or Pt adlayers on W(lll) as well as on {211} facets produced by annealing above 750 K."
[3] "The measurements are carried out on beamline U4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source."
[4] "The beamline is equipped with a 6 m TGM monochromator."
[5] "The photons are incident at an angle of 45° with respect to the surface normal and photoelectrons are collected by a 100 mm mean radius hemispherical energy analyzer (manufactured by VSW) along the surface normal."
[6] "The photon energy used in this study is 75 eV and the total instrumental resolution estimated from the Fermi edge at 300 K is 120 meV."
[7] "Fig. 2a shows a spectrum of the W 4f core level of W(lll)."
[8] "Each spin-orbit split component has two well-resolved peaks."
[9] "The surface (subsurface) peak is shifted to the lower binding energy side of the bulk peak by 430 meV (110 meV)."
[10] "As 1.5 ML Pd (or - 1.1 ML Pt) is adsorbed on W(lll) at 300 K, only a bulk-like W peak is observed."
[11] "On the other hand, one would expect to observe a W peak associated with W atoms at the Pd-W or Pt-W interface."
[12] "As the film-covered W(lll) surface is annealed to 900 K for 3 min, film-covered {211} facets develop."
[13] "The corresponding W 4f/2 spectra for Pd and Pt films are shown in Figs. 2c and 3c, respectively."
[14] "The salient features of these spectra are the broadening of the lineshape and the shifting of the centroid of the lineshape to the lower binding energy side of the bulk W peak."
[15] "A simple bond counting argument suggests that Pd or Pt will bond more strongly on the W(lll) surface than on the W(211) surface due to the rough open nature of W(lll)."
[16] "Furthermore, on W(ll0), Pt is found to bond considerably more strongly than Pd [12,13]; one could expect that Pt also bonds more strongly on the {211} facets than Pd."
[17] "A more straightforward way to understand the shifts associated with the interface W peaks is to use a Born-Haber cycle."
[18] "Consider Pd adsorption on W(lll) as an example: the binding energy difference between the interface W 4fT/a and the surface W 4f7/2, AE w, is called the adhesion shift."
[19] "Based on the ECA, the quantity AE w is related to the difference between the heat of adhesion of Re on Pd, a ATva, and that of W on Pd, A7 w."
[20] "Unfortunately, surface energies of very few single crystal surfaces of refractory metals are available (in particular, none are available experi- mentally for Pd in the bcc structure)."
[21] "On the other hand, the anisotropy in the surface energies for different crystallographic directions can be determined, e.g. from the shape of thermally annealed field emission tips [16] or from the surface core level shifts [17]."
[22] "Similarly, the anisotropy in inter- facial energies can be inferred from the difference in the adhesion shift."
[23] "Nevertheless, the present example is not easy to interpret since hcp Re (to the right of W in the periodic table) has a crystalline structure which is different from bcc W."
[24] "The anisotropy in the surface energies for Re in the bcc structure has not been measured."
[25] "However, bcc Ta(ll 1) (to the left of W in the periodic table) may be a good candidate."
[26] "The adhesion shift measured on Ta(lll) induced by Pd is Ta _ Ta AEad - A7 w - AYva."
[27] "If Pd-covered Ta(lll) goes through the same faceting transition upon annealing as Pd-covered W(lll) does, the differ- ence in the adhesion shift (before and after the faceting transition) is Ta AEa(lll)"
[28] "In order to test this relation, the surface core level shifts for Ta(211) and W(211) surfaces have to be measured, in addition to the measurement of the adhesion shift for Pd/Ta(111)."
[29] "These measurements are currently planned."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The study employs high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy using synchrotron radiation to investigate the W 4f7/2 core level shifts accompanying adsorption of Pd or Pt adlayers on W(lll) surfaces as well as on {211} facets produced by annealing above 750 K. The measurements are conducted on beamline U4A at the National Synchrotron Light Source, utilizing a 6 m TGM monochromator, collecting photoelectrons at an angle of 45° with respect to the surface normal using a 100 mm mean radius hemispherical energy analyzer. The photon energy used in this study is 75 eV, and the total instrumental resolution is estimated to be 120 meV.

The core level photoelectron spectroscopy allows for indirect probing of the substrate electronic response and determination of energetics of metal-metal interfaces. By analyzing the core level shifts, researchers can infer the surface and interfacial energies within the framework of the Equivalent Core Approximation (ECA). To test the relation between the difference in interfacial energies and the adhesion shift, surface core level shifts for Ta(211) and W(211) surfaces need to be measured, along with the adhesion shift for Pd/Ta(111), which is currently planned.

In summary, the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is essential for understanding their electronic and chemical properties, and the methodology employed in this study provides a robust approach for determining energetics of metal-metal interfaces and surface properties.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。研究使用同步辐射光电子谱学的高分辨率光电子谱学方法，以探究Pd或Pt吸附层在W(lll)表面上以及通过750 K以上的退火产生的{211}晶面的W 4f7/2核心能级偏移。测量在国家同步辐射光源的U4A光束线上进行，使用6米TGM色散器，并收集与表面法线成45°角的光电子，通过具有100毫米平均半径的球面能量分析仪沿表面法线收集。研究中使用的光子能量为75 eV，总仪器分辨率估计为120 meV。

核心水平光电子谱学允许间接探测基体电子响应并确定金属-金属界面的能量。通过分析核心能级偏移，研究人员可以推断出在框架内基于等效核心近似（ECA）的表面和界面能量。为了测试界面能与粘附偏移之间的关系，需要测量Ta(211)和W(211)表面的核心能级偏移，以及Pd/Ta(111)的粘附偏移，这目前正在进行规划。

综上所述，Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征对于理解它们的电子和化学性质至关重要，而本研究采用的方法为确定金属-金属界面能量和表面性质提供了一种稳健的途径。
