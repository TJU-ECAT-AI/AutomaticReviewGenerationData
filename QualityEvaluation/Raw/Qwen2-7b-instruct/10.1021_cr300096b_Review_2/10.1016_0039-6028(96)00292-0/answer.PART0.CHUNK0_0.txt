[1] "In recent years there has been a growing interest in the growth of thin films on metal substrates due to the fundamental importance of these systems in both heterogeneous catalysis and surface science."
[2] "The system tends to form the energetically most favourable configuration, while kinetics determines the growth behaviour of the film."
[3] "Low energy Li + ion scattering with a combination of LEED has been used to study thin Pt films on Cu(111)."
[4] "LEIS is especially well suited for this study since it has extreme sensitivity to the surface layers of the thin film and the alloy."
[5] "The angle resolved ion scattering system, Co-lutron ion source and experimental method have been described previously."
[6] "The Pt film on Cu(lll) at RT grows in the regular fcc stacking up to at least five layers. A metastable surface alloy is formed on annealing to about 300C and is examined to consist of at least three layers of Cu3Pt."
[7] "The observed composition change with temperature strongly suggests that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy is CuaPt."
[8] "Neither CuPt(lll) nor CuPt3(lll) surface phase has been evidenced in this study."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The method used allows for detailed examination of the surface structure and properties, enabling researchers to model and predict the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces under various conditions.
