[1] "In the present study we report the first LEIS measurements for thin Pt films on Cu(111) deposited at RT (_< 50C) and subsequently annealed."
[2] "LEIS is especially well suited for this study since it has extreme sensitivity to the surface layers of the thin film and the alloy."
[3] "The angle resolved ion scattering system, Co-lutron ion source and experimental method have been described previously [6]."
[4] "For the annealing temperature of  300C, Pt-Cu intermixing was observed, forming a metastable Cu3Pt surface alloy."
[5] "Neither CuPt(lll) nor CuPt3(lll) surface phase has been evidenced in this study."
[6] "The observed composition change with temperature strongly suggests that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy is CuaPt."
[7] "The surface alloy structure was stable between  280-380C for 3 ML Pt, the stability regime decreasing to  250-350C for 1 ML Pt."

This study utilized Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) to analyze thin Pt films on Cu(111) substrates, both at room temperature and after annealing at 300°C. The LEIS technique proved effective for studying surface layers, revealing that at room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu(111) in a regular fcc stacking sequence. Upon annealing, a metastable Cu3Pt surface alloy formed, consisting of at least three layers. The alloy's stability ranged between 280-380°C for 3 ML Pt and 250-350°C for 1 ML Pt. The study did not evidence CuPt(lll) or CuPt3(lll) surface phases.

本研究利用低能离子散射（LEIS）技术分析了室温下沉积在Cu(111)基底上的薄Pt薄膜以及随后在300°C下的退火情况。LEIS技术特别适用于此研究，因为它对薄膜表面层具有极高的敏感性。研究发现，在室温下，Pt以常规的fcc堆叠序列在Cu(111)上形成外延生长。经过退火后，形成了一种稳定的Cu3Pt表面合金，至少由三层组成。该合金的稳定性在3ML Pt情况下为280-380°C，在1ML Pt情况下为250-350°C。研究没有发现CuPt(lll)或CuPt3(lll)表面相态。
