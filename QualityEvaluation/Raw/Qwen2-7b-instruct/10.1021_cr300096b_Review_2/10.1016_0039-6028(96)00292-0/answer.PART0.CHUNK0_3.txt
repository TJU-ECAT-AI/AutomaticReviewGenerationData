[1] "Low energy Li + ion scattering with a combination of LEED has been used to study thin Pt films on Cu(111) deposited at room temperature ( < 50C) and subsequently heated."
[2] "At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu(111) in the regular fcc stacking sequence for a thickness of at least five monolayers."
[3] "For the annealing temperature of  300C, Pt-Cu intermixing was observed, forming a metastable Cu3Pt surface alloy."
[4] "Analysis of the surface layers was made by analysing the incident angle dependence associated with shadowing effects and comparison to the results obtained from a bulk Cu3Pt(111) single crystal, revealing that the alloy is Cu3Pt(111) phase over at least three atomic layers."
[5] "Neither CuPt(111) nor CuPt3(111) surface phase has been evidenced in this study."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for detailed examination of the structural properties, electronic behavior, and chemical interactions at the interface. Understanding these aspects is vital for the development and optimization of materials in advanced surface science and catalysis research, enabling the prediction and enhancement of catalytic activities and surface reactivity.
