[1] "Low energy Li + ion scattering with a combination of LEED has been used to study thin Pt films on Cu(111) deposited at room temperature ( < 50C) and subsequently heated."
[2] "At as-deposited surface, only the Pt signals are observed, showing the azimuthal dependence along the low index directions although the main shadowing dips are less pronounced (Fig. la) compared to the clean Cu(lll) surface (Fig. lc)."
[3] "When Pt films are annealed to 300C, both Pt and Cu are detectable due to interdiffusion. The fact that the Pt and Cu b scans are nearly identical in shape (Fig. lb) compared to the scans from Cu3Pt(lll) (Fig. ld) reveals the formation of a Cu3Pt surface alloy."
[4] "Our annealing results indicate that Pt overlayers on Cu(111) undergo intermixing with the substrate at moderate temperatures. Under appropriate annealing conditions ( 300C), this leads to the formation of a metastable surface alloy."
[5] "Neither CuPt(lll) nor CuPt3(lll) surface phase has been evidenced in this study."
[6] "The experimental observation that an fcc stacking sequence is adopted implies strong Pt-Pt interactions. This is in agreement with previous conclusions that Pt grows layer-by-layer at least up to a few surface layers."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control and investigation of the interface between the two metals. By depositing Ni on Pt, researchers can study the interactions and properties of the bimetallic system, which is essential for optimizing catalyst performance and understanding the underlying mechanisms of catalytic reactions.
