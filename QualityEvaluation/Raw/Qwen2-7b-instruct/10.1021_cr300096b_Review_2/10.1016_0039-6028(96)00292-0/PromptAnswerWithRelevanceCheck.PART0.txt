[1] "In recent years there has been a growing interest in the growth of thin films on metal substrates due to the fundamental importance of these systems in both heterogeneous catalysis and surface science."
[2] "The system tends to form the energetically most favourable configuration, while kinetics determines the growth behaviour of the film."
[3] "Low energy Li + ion scattering with a combination of LEED has been used to study thin Pt films on Cu(111)."
[4] "LEIS is especially well suited for this study since it has extreme sensitivity to the surface layers of the thin film and the alloy."
[5] "The angle resolved ion scattering system, Co-lutron ion source and experimental method have been described previously."
[6] "The Pt film on Cu(lll) at RT grows in the regular fcc stacking up to at least five layers. A metastable surface alloy is formed on annealing to about 300C and is examined to consist of at least three layers of Cu3Pt."
[7] "The observed composition change with temperature strongly suggests that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy is CuaPt."
[8] "Neither CuPt(lll) nor CuPt3(lll) surface phase has been evidenced in this study."

[1] "Low energy Li + ion scattering with a combination of LEED has been used to study thin Pt films on Cu(111) deposited at room temperature ( < 50C) and subsequently heated."
[2] "At as-deposited surface, only the Pt signals are observed, showing the azimuthal dependence along the low index directions although the main shadowing dips are less pronounced (Fig. la) compared to the clean Cu(lll) surface (Fig. lc)."
[3] "When Pt films are annealed to 300C, both Pt and Cu are detectable due to interdiffusion. The fact that the Pt and Cu b scans are nearly identical in shape (Fig. lb) compared to the scans from Cu3Pt(lll) (Fig. ld) reveals the formation of a Cu3Pt surface alloy."
[4] "Our annealing results indicate that Pt overlayers on Cu(111) undergo intermixing with the substrate at moderate temperatures. Under appropriate annealing conditions ( 300C), this leads to the formation of a metastable surface alloy."
[5] "Neither CuPt(lll) nor CuPt3(lll) surface phase has been evidenced in this study."
[6] "The experimental observation that an fcc stacking sequence is adopted implies strong Pt-Pt interactions. This is in agreement with previous conclusions that Pt grows layer-by-layer at least up to a few surface layers."

This study utilized Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS) to analyze thin Pt films on Cu(111) substrates, both at room temperature and after annealing at 300°C. The LEIS technique proved effective for studying surface layers, revealing that at room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu(111) in a regular fcc stacking sequence. Upon annealing, a metastable Cu3Pt surface alloy formed, consisting of at least three layers. The alloy's stability ranged between 280-380°C for 3 ML Pt and 250-350°C for 1 ML Pt. The study did not evidence CuPt(lll) or CuPt3(lll) surface phases.

本研究利用低能离子散射（LEIS）技术分析了室温下沉积在Cu(111)基底上的薄Pt薄膜以及随后在300°C下的退火情况。LEIS技术特别适用于此研究，因为它对薄膜表面层具有极高的敏感性。研究发现，在室温下，Pt以常规的fcc堆叠序列在Cu(111)上形成外延生长。经过退火后，形成了一种稳定的Cu3Pt表面合金，至少由三层组成。该合金的稳定性在3ML Pt情况下为280-380°C，在1ML Pt情况下为250-350°C。研究没有发现CuPt(lll)或CuPt3(lll)表面相态。
