[1] "The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy."
[2] "Coadsorption of hydrogen adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) weakens the chemisorption bonding of ethylene to the surface and greatly increases the production of ethane in TPD experiments."
[3] "The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this Sn/Pt(111) alloy is dramatically different than on the Pt(111) surface: the H-addition reaction channel taking ethylene to ethane on Pt(111) is totally inhibited on the alloy."
[4] "Our results show that only 0.35 ML of preadsorbed H, which occupies one-half the available Pt sites, will totally block the adsorption of ethylene."
[5] "The other major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy."

The research on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy revealed that the reaction pathway involving coadsorbed hydrogen and ethylene leading to the formation of ethane upon heating is completely inhibited on this alloy. This pathway is prominent on the pure Pt(111) surface. The study also found that the adsorption and reaction of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy differ significantly from those on the pure Pt(111) surface, specifically, the hydrogenation pathway that converts ethylene to ethane through hydrogen addition is fully suppressed on the alloy. Moreover, only a minimal amount of preadsorbed hydrogen, occupying half of the available Pt sites, is sufficient to block the adsorption of ethylene on the alloy. Additionally, the experiments highlighted a substantial disparity in the hydrogenation reactivity between the Pt(111) surface and the Sn/Pt(111) alloy.

这项关于（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt(111)表面合金的研究发现，在此合金上，氢和乙烯之间在加热时导致生成乙烷的反应途径完全被抑制。这种途径在纯Pt(111)表面上是显而易见的。研究还发现，乙烯在Sn/Pt(111)合金上的吸附和反应与纯Pt(111)表面存在显著差异，特别是通过氢化将乙烯转化为乙烷的氢化路径在合金上被完全抑制。此外，只有极少量的预吸附氢，占据Pt表面的一半可用位点，足以阻止乙烯的吸附。此外，实验突出了Pt(111)表面与Sn/Pt(111)合金在氢化反应活性上的巨大差异。
