<p>The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>Figure 4 summarizes the influence of preadsorbed H adatoms on the ethylene monolayer (saturation) coverage on the 3 alloy, as obtained by integration of the ethylene TPD peak areas. The saturation coverage of ethylene on the clean 3 alloy was set to 1.0 on the left axis, and this corresponds to an actual coverage of 0.27 ML.21 The actual ethylene coverages are provided on the right-hand axis. Ethylene coverage was decreased linearly with increasing amounts of preadsorbed H adatoms. For θH = 0.30 ML, the ethylene saturation coverage is reduced to only 18% of that on the clean 3 alloy. Extrapolation of the line given in Figure 4 indicates that the chemisorption of di-σ-bonded ethylene will be completely blocked when 0.35 ML of H adatoms is preadsorbed on the 3 alloy surface.</p>
<p>Another effect is to cause a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene, but this perturbation is rather small. The most significant, and unexpected, effect of hydrogen coadsorption is to cause a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption. Preadsorption of 0.3-ML H is sufficient to eliminate population of di-σ-bonded ethylene on the 3 alloy surface.</p>
<p>The other major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy. Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating.3,13 This reaction pathway is totally blocked on the 3 alloy. This is unexpected.</p>
<p>Our results have important implications for modeling and understanding catalytic hydrogenation over bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts. Adding Sn to supported Pt catalysts causes a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity for the propene (C3H6) hydrogenation reaction. 36 The hydrogenation activity for ethylene and 1-hexene (C6H12) is also inhibited on Pt/Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. 37 Our surface science results are consistent with these observations, even though Pt/Sn alloy phases have not been identified as catalytically active in these catalysts.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves a series of steps that are crucial for understanding their electronic and chemical properties. The process typically includes the preparation of the Pt substrate, the deposition of the Ni monolayer, and the subsequent characterization using techniques such as AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) and TPD (Temperature Programmed Desorption). AES helps in determining the composition and bonding state of the surface, while TPD provides insights into the adsorption and desorption kinetics of various molecules, including ethylene. This characterization is essential for structural modeling and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, which aim to predict and understand the behavior of these bimetallic surfaces under various conditions. The detailed knowledge gained from such characterizations aids in comprehending how the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces influence their catalytic activities, especially in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Adding Sn to platinum catalysts decreases the alkene hydrogenation activity by not only reducing the interaction between alkenes and Pt but also by decreasing the reactivity of adsorbed alkenes at the catalyst surface. The findings from the surface science studies on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy contribute significantly to explaining this phenomenon. Specifically, the total inhibition of the hydrogenation reaction pathway between ethylene and coadsorbed hydrogen on the Sn/Pt alloy, coupled with the decreased saturation coverage of ethylene due to site-blocking effects caused by hydrogen, highlights the role of alloying Sn in modifying the surface chemistry and catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通常涉及一系列步骤，对于理解它们的电子和化学性质至关重要。这些步骤包括Pt基体的制备、Ni单层的沉积以及使用AES（Auger电子能谱）和TPD（温度程序脱附）等技术进行表征。AES有助于确定表面的组成和键合状态，而TPD提供了分子吸附和脱附动力学的见解，包括乙烷。这样的表征对于结构建模和DFT（密度泛函理论）计算至关重要，这些计算旨在预测和理解这些双金属表面在不同条件下的行为。从这些表征中获得的详细知识有助于了解这些表面的电子和化学性质如何影响其催化活性，尤其是在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下。

将Sn添加到铂催化剂中会降低烯烃氢化反应的活性，不仅减少了铂与烯烃之间的相互作用，还降低了吸附在催化剂表面的烯烃的活性。表面科学研究中的（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt（111）表面合金发现对这一现象的解释贡献显著。具体而言，在Sn/Pt合金上完全抑制了乙烷和共吸附氢之间的氢化反应途径，以及由于氢的存在导致乙烷饱和覆盖率降低，显示出通过合金化Sn修改铂基催化剂表面化学和催化行为的作用。
