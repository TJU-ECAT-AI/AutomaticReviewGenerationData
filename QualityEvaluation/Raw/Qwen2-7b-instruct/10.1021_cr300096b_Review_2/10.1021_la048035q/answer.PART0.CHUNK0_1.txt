[1] "Preadsorbed H decreased the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and less H was required to completely block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy than that on Pt(111)."
[2] "This is also the first report of extensive H site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption on Pt(111)."
[3] "Preadsorbed H also decreased the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface."
[4] "The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this Sn/Pt(111) alloy is dramatically different than on the Pt(111) surface: the H-addition reaction channel taking ethylene to ethane on Pt(111) is totally inhibited on the alloy."
[5] "Our results show that only 0.35 ML of preadsorbed H, which occupies one-half the available Pt sites, will totally block the adsorption of ethylene."
[6] "These surface Sn atoms directly eliminate Pt sites by their physical presence and also affect the electronic structure of neighboring Pt sites."
[7] "Our findings that no ethylene hydrogenation occurs upon heating a coadsorbed monolayer of H adatoms and ethylene on the 3 alloy implies that π-bonded ethylene is not particularly reactive and ethylene simply desorbs at a temperature that is lower than that required for hydrogenation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves several key steps crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. Firstly, the formation of the bimetallic interface is critical, as it determines the spatial distribution of Ni and Pt atoms, influencing the surface morphology and electronic structure. The deposition process typically involves physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), depending on the specific requirements of the application. The subsequent annealing step is essential for achieving a well-defined interface, often involving thermal treatments at high temperatures to promote interdiffusion between Ni and Pt layers.

Structural modeling plays a pivotal role in predicting the surface configurations and properties. Techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) provide high-resolution images of the surface, enabling detailed analysis of the bimetallic interface. The use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations helps in understanding the electronic structure, including bonding characteristics, reactivity, and stability of various surface species. This computational approach is invaluable for predicting the behavior of adsorbates and reaction pathways on the bimetallic surface.

Understanding the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is crucial for applications in catalysis, where the surface chemistry significantly affects the performance of catalysts. The bimetallic interface often exhibits unique properties, such as enhanced stability, selectivity, or reactivity, compared to their individual components. For instance, the alloying of Ni and Pt can lead to a reduction in the activation energy for certain reactions, improved resistance to poisoning, or altered selectivity towards desired products.

In summary, the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. This comprehensive approach not only aids in the synthesis of high-performance catalysts but also contributes to the fundamental understanding of surface science and catalytic processes.

对于Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层进行合成，涉及几个关键步骤，对结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。首先，双金属界面的形成至关重要，它决定了Ni和Pt原子的空间分布，影响表面形态和电子结构。沉积过程通常采用物理气相沉积（PVD）或化学气相沉积（CVD），具体取决于应用需求。随后的退火步骤对于实现明确的界面至关重要，通常需要在高温下进行热处理，以促进Ni和Pt层之间的相互扩散。

结构建模在预测表面配置和属性方面起着核心作用。技术如扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和原子力显微镜（AFM）提供了高分辨率的表面图像，使研究人员能够详细分析双金属界面。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算有助于理解电子结构，包括键合特性、反应性和各种表面物种的稳定性。这种计算方法对于预测吸附剂和表面物种的行为非常有价值。

了解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质对于催化剂应用至关重要，这些表面化学显著影响催化剂的性能。双金属界面往往展现出与各自成分相比独特的性质，例如降低特定反应的活化能、增强稳定性、选择性或对所需产品的偏好。例如，Ni和Pt的合金化可能导致某些反应的激活能降低、抗中毒能力增强或对期望产物的选择性改变。

总之，Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及实验技术和理论计算的结合。这种全面的方法不仅有助于合成高性能催化剂，而且促进了表面科学和催化过程的基本理解。
