The study focused on how surface-bound hydrogen adatoms impact the adsorption, desorption, and reactions of ethylene on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy. It was found that hydrogen adsorption reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene. The amount of hydrogen needed to fully block ethylene chemisorption on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy was less than on pure Pt(111). This is the first report of hydrogen causing extensive site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption on Pt(111). Additionally, hydrogen reduced the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface. The reaction pathways of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy diverge significantly from those on pure Pt(111); notably, the hydrogenation route that produces ethane on Pt(111) is completely inhibited on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy.

研究集中在表面吸附的氢原子对乙烯在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上吸附、脱附和反应的影响。发现氢吸附减少了化学吸附乙烯的饱和覆盖度。在Sn/Pt(111)合金上完全阻塞乙烯化学吸附所需的氢量少于纯Pt(111)。这是首次报告氢在Pt(111)上造成广泛的化学吸附位点阻塞。此外，氢降低了合金表面乙烯的脱附活化能。乙烯在Sn/Pt(111)合金上的反应路径与纯Pt(111)大不相同；特别是，在Pt(111)上生成乙烷的氢化途径在Sn/Pt(111)合金上完全被抑制。
