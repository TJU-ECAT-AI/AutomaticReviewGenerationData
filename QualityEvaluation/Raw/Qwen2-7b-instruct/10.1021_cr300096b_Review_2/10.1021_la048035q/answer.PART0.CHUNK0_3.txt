[1] "Preadsorbed H decreased the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and less H was required to completely block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy than that on Pt(111)."
[2] "Preadsorbed H also decreased the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface."
[3] "Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating."
[4] "Our finding that no ethylene hydrogenation occurs upon heating a coadsorbed monolayer of H adatoms and ethylene on the 3 alloy implies that π-bonded ethylene is not particularly reactive and ethylene simply desorbs at a temperature that is lower than that required for hydrogenation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it enables structural modeling, DFT calculations, and a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The bimetallic interfaces allow for unique surface properties that differ from those of pure metals, influencing catalytic activities and reactivities. By synthesizing these surfaces, researchers can explore how the composition, structure, and electronic configurations affect the performance of materials in various applications, including catalysis, electronics, and energy conversion technologies.
