<p>The effect of surface-bound hydrogen adatoms on adsorption, desorption, and reaction of ethylene (CH2CH2) on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy with θSn = 0.33 was investigated by using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES).</p>
<p>Preadsorbed H decreased the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene and less H was required to completely block ethylene chemisorption on this alloy than that on Pt(111).</p>
<p>This is also the first report of extensive H site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption on Pt(111).</p>
<p>Preadsorbed H also decreased the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface.</p>
<p>The reaction chemistry of ethylene on this Sn/Pt(111) alloy is dramatically different than on the Pt(111) surface: the H-addition reaction channel taking ethylene to ethane on Pt(111) is totally inhibited on the alloy.</p>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The study focused on how surface-bound hydrogen adatoms impact the adsorption, desorption, and reactions of ethylene on a (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) alloy. It was found that hydrogen adsorption reduces the saturation coverage of chemisorbed ethylene. The amount of hydrogen needed to fully block ethylene chemisorption on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy was less than on pure Pt(111). This is the first report of hydrogen causing extensive site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption on Pt(111). Additionally, hydrogen reduced the desorption activation energy of ethylene on the alloy surface. The reaction pathways of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy diverge significantly from those on pure Pt(111); notably, the hydrogenation route that produces ethane on Pt(111) is completely inhibited on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy.

研究集中在表面吸附的氢原子对乙烯在(3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111)合金上吸附、脱附和反应的影响。发现氢吸附减少了化学吸附乙烯的饱和覆盖度。在Sn/Pt(111)合金上完全阻塞乙烯化学吸附所需的氢量少于纯Pt(111)。这是首次报告氢在Pt(111)上造成广泛的化学吸附位点阻塞。此外，氢降低了合金表面乙烯的脱附活化能。乙烯在Sn/Pt(111)合金上的反应路径与纯Pt(111)大不相同；特别是，在Pt(111)上生成乙烷的氢化途径在Sn/Pt(111)合金上完全被抑制。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves several key steps crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. Firstly, the formation of the bimetallic interface is critical, as it determines the spatial distribution of Ni and Pt atoms, influencing the surface morphology and electronic structure. The deposition process typically involves physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), depending on the specific requirements of the application. The subsequent annealing step is essential for achieving a well-defined interface, often involving thermal treatments at high temperatures to promote interdiffusion between Ni and Pt layers.

Structural modeling plays a pivotal role in predicting the surface configurations and properties. Techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) provide high-resolution images of the surface, enabling detailed analysis of the bimetallic interface. The use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations helps in understanding the electronic structure, including bonding characteristics, reactivity, and stability of various surface species. This computational approach is invaluable for predicting the behavior of adsorbates and reaction pathways on the bimetallic surface.

Understanding the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is crucial for applications in catalysis, where the surface chemistry significantly affects the performance of catalysts. The bimetallic interface often exhibits unique properties, such as enhanced stability, selectivity, or reactivity, compared to their individual components. For instance, the alloying of Ni and Pt can lead to a reduction in the activation energy for certain reactions, improved resistance to poisoning, or altered selectivity towards desired products.

In summary, the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves a combination of experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. This comprehensive approach not only aids in the synthesis of high-performance catalysts but also contributes to the fundamental understanding of surface science and catalytic processes.

结构建模在预测表面配置和属性方面起着核心作用。技术如扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和原子力显微镜（AFM）提供了高分辨率的表面图像，使研究人员能够详细分析双金属界面。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算有助于理解电子结构，包括键合特性、反应性和各种表面物种的稳定性。这种计算方法对于预测吸附剂和表面物种的行为非常有价值。

了解Ni/Pt双金属表面的电子和化学性质对于催化剂应用至关重要，这些表面化学显著影响催化剂的性能。双金属界面往往展现出与各自成分相比独特的性质，例如降低特定反应的活化能、增强稳定性、选择性或对所需产品的偏好。例如，Ni和Pt的合金化可能导致某些反应的激活能降低、抗中毒能力增强或对期望产物的选择性改变。

总之，Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及实验技术和理论计算的结合。这种全面的方法不仅有助于合成高性能催化剂，而且促进了表面科学和催化过程的基本理解。

<p>The most significant finding of this investigation is that the reaction pathway that is so prominent on Pt(111) between coadsorbed H adatoms and ethylene resulting in the evolution of gas-phase ethane upon heating is totally blocked on the 3 alloy.</p>
<p>Figure 4 summarizes the influence of preadsorbed H adatoms on the ethylene monolayer (saturation) coverage on the 3 alloy, as obtained by integration of the ethylene TPD peak areas. The saturation coverage of ethylene on the clean 3 alloy was set to 1.0 on the left axis, and this corresponds to an actual coverage of 0.27 ML.21 The actual ethylene coverages are provided on the right-hand axis. Ethylene coverage was decreased linearly with increasing amounts of preadsorbed H adatoms. For θH = 0.30 ML, the ethylene saturation coverage is reduced to only 18% of that on the clean 3 alloy. Extrapolation of the line given in Figure 4 indicates that the chemisorption of di-σ-bonded ethylene will be completely blocked when 0.35 ML of H adatoms is preadsorbed on the 3 alloy surface.</p>
<p>Another effect is to cause a decrease in the adsorption energy of coadsorbed di-σ-bonded ethylene, but this perturbation is rather small. The most significant, and unexpected, effect of hydrogen coadsorption is to cause a nearly 1:1 site-blocking of ethylene chemisorption. Preadsorption of 0.3-ML H is sufficient to eliminate population of di-σ-bonded ethylene on the 3 alloy surface.</p>
<p>The other major finding of this work is the large difference in hydrogenation activity in these experiments between the Pt(111) surface and the 3 alloy. Coadsorption of H adatoms and ethylene on Pt(111) forms mostly ethane upon heating.3,13 This reaction pathway is totally blocked on the 3 alloy. This is unexpected.</p>
<p>Our results have important implications for modeling and understanding catalytic hydrogenation over bimetallic Pt/Sn catalysts. Adding Sn to supported Pt catalysts causes a dramatic decrease in catalytic activity for the propene (C3H6) hydrogenation reaction. 36 The hydrogenation activity for ethylene and 1-hexene (C6H12) is also inhibited on Pt/Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. 37 Our surface science results are consistent with these observations, even though Pt/Sn alloy phases have not been identified as catalytically active in these catalysts.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves a series of steps that are crucial for understanding their electronic and chemical properties. The process typically includes the preparation of the Pt substrate, the deposition of the Ni monolayer, and the subsequent characterization using techniques such as AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy) and TPD (Temperature Programmed Desorption). AES helps in determining the composition and bonding state of the surface, while TPD provides insights into the adsorption and desorption kinetics of various molecules, including ethylene. This characterization is essential for structural modeling and DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, which aim to predict and understand the behavior of these bimetallic surfaces under various conditions. The detailed knowledge gained from such characterizations aids in comprehending how the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces influence their catalytic activities, especially in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Adding Sn to platinum catalysts decreases the alkene hydrogenation activity by not only reducing the interaction between alkenes and Pt but also by decreasing the reactivity of adsorbed alkenes at the catalyst surface. The findings from the surface science studies on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy contribute significantly to explaining this phenomenon. Specifically, the total inhibition of the hydrogenation reaction pathway between ethylene and coadsorbed hydrogen on the Sn/Pt alloy, coupled with the decreased saturation coverage of ethylene due to site-blocking effects caused by hydrogen, highlights the role of alloying Sn in modifying the surface chemistry and catalytic behavior of Pt-based catalysts.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通常涉及一系列步骤，对于理解它们的电子和化学性质至关重要。这些步骤包括Pt基体的制备、Ni单层的沉积以及使用AES（Auger电子能谱）和TPD（温度程序脱附）等技术进行表征。AES有助于确定表面的组成和键合状态，而TPD提供了分子吸附和脱附动力学的见解，包括乙烷。这样的表征对于结构建模和DFT（密度泛函理论）计算至关重要，这些计算旨在预测和理解这些双金属表面在不同条件下的行为。从这些表征中获得的详细知识有助于了解这些表面的电子和化学性质如何影响其催化活性，尤其是在先进表面科学和催化研究的背景下。

将Sn添加到铂催化剂中会降低烯烃氢化反应的活性，不仅减少了铂与烯烃之间的相互作用，还降低了吸附在催化剂表面的烯烃的活性。表面科学研究中的（3×3）R30-Sn/Pt（111）表面合金发现对这一现象的解释贡献显著。具体而言，在Sn/Pt合金上完全抑制了乙烷和共吸附氢之间的氢化反应途径，以及由于氢的存在导致乙烷饱和覆盖率降低，显示出通过合金化Sn修改铂基催化剂表面化学和催化行为的作用。

The research on the (3×3)R30-Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy revealed that the reaction pathway involving coadsorbed hydrogen and ethylene leading to the formation of ethane upon heating is completely inhibited on this alloy. This pathway is prominent on the pure Pt(111) surface. The study also found that the adsorption and reaction of ethylene on the Sn/Pt(111) alloy differ significantly from those on the pure Pt(111) surface, specifically, the hydrogenation pathway that converts ethylene to ethane through hydrogen addition is fully suppressed on the alloy. Moreover, only a minimal amount of preadsorbed hydrogen, occupying half of the available Pt sites, is sufficient to block the adsorption of ethylene on the alloy. Additionally, the experiments highlighted a substantial disparity in the hydrogenation reactivity between the Pt(111) surface and the Sn/Pt(111) alloy.
