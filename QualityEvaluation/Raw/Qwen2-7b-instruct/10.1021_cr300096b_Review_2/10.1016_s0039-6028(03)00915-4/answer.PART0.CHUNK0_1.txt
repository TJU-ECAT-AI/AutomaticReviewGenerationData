<p>For comparison, reported values for the initial sticking coefficient for (room temperature) hydrogen adsorption on Pt(1 1 1) range around 0.1.</p>
<p>The lower value of the hydrogen sticking coefficient on Pt(1 1 1) compared with Ru(0 0 0 1) agrees with our own finding for hydrogen adsorption on thick Pt films.</p>
<p>Assuming a flux of 106 molecules per metal surface atom and s 1 this is equivalent to a hydrogen partial pressure of 1 mbar, using the sticking coefficient of s0=0.25 derived from the above data and not including hydrogen losses due to hydrogen oxidation the steady state hydrogen coverage in thermal equilibrium will be reduced from close to saturation (0.95 ML) on Pt(1 1 1) to around 0.3 ML on the PtRu bimetallic surface or to below 0.05 ML on a Pt monolayer covered Ru surface.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. The electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces are comprehensively understood through detailed analysis of their structure and interactions with various adsorbates. The Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces offer unique properties that are not present in pure metals, making them valuable for applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
