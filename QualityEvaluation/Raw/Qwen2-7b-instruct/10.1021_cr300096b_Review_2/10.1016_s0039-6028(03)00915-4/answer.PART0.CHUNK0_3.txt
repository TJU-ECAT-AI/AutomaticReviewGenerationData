3.1. D2 TPD spectra recorded after increasing deuterium exposures are displayed in Fig. 2 . For comparison with literature data [16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] and for calibrating the absolute hydrogen coverage we first recorded a saturation D2 TPD spectrum from an unmodified Ru(0 0 0 1) surface (broken line). Both peak temperature (Tmax=330 K) and peak shape agree well with previous findings, underlining the cleanness of the Ru(0 0 0 1) sample.
3.2. Coadsorption of D2 and CO on PtRu surface alloy
Next we will investigate the effect of coadsorbed CO on the hydrogen adsorption behavior on the bimetallic substrate, using the same 40% Pt containing PtRu surface alloy. This will be done by preadsorbing increasing amounts of D2 and subsequently saturating the surface with 10 L CO (adsorption temperature 100 K). The opposite experiment, preadsorbing increasing amounts of CO and subsequent saturation by D2, is not so interesting in this context since adsorbed CO was found to block the surface for subsequent D2 adsorption and is not replaced by adsorbing hydrogen under these conditions, and is hence not shown here.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process enables detailed analysis of the surface structure and composition, which in turn informs the design of more efficient catalysts and materials.
