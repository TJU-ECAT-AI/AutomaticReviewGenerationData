[1] "The experiments were performed in two different ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems, a UHV-scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system equipped with a home-built pocket-size STM [12] , and a UHV-system designed for spectroscopic and in situ high pressure studies on single-crystal samples [2] ."
[2] "For comparison with literature data [16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] and for calibrating the absolute hydrogen coverage we first recorded a saturation D2 TPD spectrum from an unmodified Ru(0 0 0 1) surface (broken line)."
[3] "The concentration and distribution of the Pt surface atoms were determined by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which provides further information for the mechanistic interpretation of the results and the underlying physical effects."
[4] "The continuous down-shift in the onset of D2 desorption from the 40% Pt surface alloy with increasing coverage can arise from either strongly repulsive interactions between adsorbed Dad species or from an increasing population of less stable adsorption sites with increasing coverage."
[5] "Despite of the pronounced down-shift in the temperature of the desorption peak this effect is considerably less than that observed for CO adsorption on the same surfaces, where the reduction in PtCO interaction is about 40% [2] ,[39] ."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
