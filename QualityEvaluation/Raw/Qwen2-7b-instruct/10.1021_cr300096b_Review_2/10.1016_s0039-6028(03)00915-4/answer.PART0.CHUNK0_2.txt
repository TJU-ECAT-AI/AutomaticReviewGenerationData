3.1. D2 TPD spectra recorded after increasing deuterium exposures are displayed in Fig. 2 . For comparison with literature data [16] ,[17] ,[18] ,[19] ,[20] and for calibrating the absolute hydrogen coverage we first recorded a saturation D2 TPD spectrum from an unmodified Ru(0 0 0 1) surface (broken line). Both peak temperature (Tmax=330 K) and peak shape agree well with previous findings, underlining the cleanness of the Ru(0 0 0 1) sample.
3.2. Coadsorption of D2 and CO on PtRu surface alloy
Next we will investigate the effect of coadsorbed CO on the hydrogen adsorption behavior on the bimetallic substrate, using the same 40% Pt containing PtRu surface alloy. This will be done by preadsorbing increasing amounts of D2 and subsequently saturating the surface with 10 L CO (adsorption temperature 100 K). The opposite experiment, preadsorbing increasing amounts of CO and subsequent saturation by D2, is not so interesting in this context since adsorbed CO was found to block the surface for subsequent D2 adsorption and is not replaced by adsorbing hydrogen under these conditions, and is hence not shown here.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows for the creation of surfaces with specific compositions and structures. By understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, researchers can gain insights into their behavior in advanced surface science and catalysis applications. The coadsorption of CO on the PtRu surface alloy leads to a further weakening of hydrogen adsorption, explaining this phenomenon through a CO-induced displacement of hydrogen from strongly binding Ru-rich ensembles to less strongly binding Pt-rich ensembles. This effect becomes significant even at 100 K, causing a partial displacement of adsorbed hydrogen. At higher temperatures and pressures, these effects result in a substantial reduction of the steady-state hydrogen coverage in a fuel cell environment.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它允许创建具有特定组成和结构的表面。通过理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质，研究人员可以获得关于它们在先进表面科学和催化应用中的行为的见解。在PtRu表面合金上共吸附CO导致氢吸附进一步减弱，通过解释这一现象，可以说明氢从强烈结合的Ru丰富簇转移到较弱结合的Pt丰富簇的CO诱导位移。这种效应甚至在100 K时变得显著，导致吸附氢的局部部分位移。在更高的温度和压力下，这些效应会导致燃料电池环境中的稳态氢覆盖率大幅降低。
