[1] "The experiments were performed in two different ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems, a UHV-scanning tunneling microscope (STM) system equipped with a home-built pocket-size STM [12], and a UHV-system designed for spectroscopic and in situ high pressure studies on single-crystal samples [2]."
[2] "The preparation of the Ru(0 0 0 1) sample followed procedures developed previously, a sequence of oxidation cycles at 1350 K in an O2 atmosphere (pO2=108 mbar, 30 min) and flash to 1600 K to remove oxidizable bulk contaminants."
[3] "The concentration and distribution of the Pt surface atoms were determined by high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which provides further information for the mechanistic interpretation of the results and the underlying physical effects."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehensively understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
