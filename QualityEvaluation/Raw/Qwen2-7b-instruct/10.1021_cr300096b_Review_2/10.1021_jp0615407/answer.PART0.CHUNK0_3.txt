1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces within advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The process of depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt substrate enables the creation of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces that exhibit unique properties, particularly their ability to discriminate between different chemical species under specific conditions. This is beneficial for applications requiring selective sensing or catalytic activities.
3. The high-temperature stability and tunable chemical selectivity of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces make them promising materials for the development of selective gas sensing devices. Their overlapping but distinct selectivity profiles facilitate the creation of arrays with diverse functionalities, enhancing chemical selectivity through the integration of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks.
