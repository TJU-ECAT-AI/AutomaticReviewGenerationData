[1] "At 870 K, the required operating temperature, all three types of chemical species are decomposed to yield the same type of graphitic depositan essential requirement for quantitative applications."
[2] "Particular merits of these systems include good high-temperature stability and good tunability of their chemical selectivity. This makes possible the development of array devices in which the elements have overlapping but different selectivity profiles."
