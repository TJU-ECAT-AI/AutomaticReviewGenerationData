<p>By varying the composition of polycrystalline bimetallic Pt/Au surfaces, good discrimination between these species can be achieved. Thus at a nominal surface composition of 75% Au (XPS), good selectivity toward 1-butene and toluene uptake is achieved, with essentially no response to n-hexane. At 80% Au the system is selective to 1-butene alone.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
