Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through various methods such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These techniques enable the detailed examination of the surface morphology, composition, and electronic structure of the bimetallic system. The process is crucial for structural modeling and density functional theory (DFT) calculations because it provides the necessary information to understand the interactions between the two metals, the formation of interfacial layers, and the electronic effects at the metal-metal interface. This knowledge is vital for comprehending the catalytic behavior and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces, which can lead to the design of more efficient catalysts for various industrial applications.
