[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves a series of advanced techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HRXPS), and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "These processes are crucial because they allow researchers to understand the precise structure of the bimetallic interface, the electronic states, and the chemical properties of the surface. This detailed knowledge is essential for optimizing the performance of these surfaces in catalytic applications."
