[1] "The cobalt/platinum interface has been object of a number of studies in view of the magnetic proper- ties of cobalt thin films and layered phases [1-3]."
[2] "When starting from a single layer of cobalt deposited on Pt(lll) we observed by X-ray photo- electron diffraction (XPD) [12] that diffusion of cobalt into the platinum bulk is limited to the two topmost surface layers only."
[3] "Measurements by low energy ion scattering (LEIS) [11,12] showed that the topmost layer in this phase is composed principally of platinum."
[4] "Hence, in the present study we used quantitative low energy electron diffraction for this purpose."
[5] "The results of the present work confirm that the surface alloy at the Co/Pt(lll) interface is two atomic layers thick."
[6] "The composition was found to be 20 at% cobalt in the topmost layer and 80 at% in the second."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, which are essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research. X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) indicates that cobalt diffusion into the platinum bulk is limited to the two topmost surface layers. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) suggests that the topmost layer is predominantly platinum. Quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED) analysis reveals that the surface alloy at the Co/Pt(111) interface consists of two atomic layers with 20 at% cobalt in the first layer and 80 at% in the second.

对于Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，需要在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积一层Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够理解这些表面的电子和化学性质，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究非常重要。X射线光电子能谱（XPD）表明，钴向铂基体的扩散仅限于表面的前两层。低能量离子散射（LEIS）表明，顶层主要是铂。定量低能电子衍射（LEED）分析显示，Co/Pt(111)界面的表面合金由两层组成，第一层的钴含量为20 at%，第二层的钴含量为80 at%。
