2.2. LEED crystallographic analysis
The LEED intensity versus potential curves (I-V curves) was measured by means of a video LEED system at normal incidence (0 = 0 ) and at 0 = 10 in the (121) direction.
3. Results and discussion
After room temperature deposition of amounts of cobalt of the order of one monolayer, the only change observed in the LEED pattern was an increase in the background and in the width of the diffracted spots of the substrate.
Taking into account the above results, the model considered in the calculations was that of a pseudo-morphic, random substitutional Pt-Co alloy with variable cobalt concentration.
In an initial phase of the calculations we considered the presence of cobalt only in the first two atomic layers from the surface.
The optimized values of the structural and compositional parameters and the corresponding R factors for the normal and off-normal incidence data sets are reported in Table 1.
In Fig. 2 we show the dependence of the R-factor on the cobalt concentration in the first two layers.
The firStointerplanar spacing coincides with the value of 2.16 A that can be obtained interpolating the bulk values for Pt25Co75 and Pt80Co20 [7,8] for an average composition of "PtsoCos0".
The R factors for the optimized model are acceptable according to the present standards, although somewhat higher than the values commonly obtained in dynamical LEED analysis.
As expected, the sensitivity of crystallographic LEED to this parameter was found to be low.
Nevertheless, this result is in agreement with the data reported in Re/. [12], where it was shown that it is possible to exploit effects due to the onset of interdiffusion (600 K) bulk diffusion in metals is an extremely slow process [13].

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to precisely control and analyze the composition and structure of the bimetallic interfaces. By depositing a monolayer of Ni, scientists can study the interaction between Ni and Pt atoms at the interface, which is essential for developing catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity. The use of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) techniques enables detailed examination of the surface layers, providing insights into the phase stability, composition, and structural properties of the bimetallic surfaces. The results from these studies contribute significantly to the development of new materials with enhanced catalytic performance.

The process begins with depositing a single atomic layer of Ni on the Pt(111) surface. After deposition, the sample undergoes annealing at high temperatures, typically 600 K, to induce interdiffusion between Ni and Pt atoms. This interdiffusion leads to the formation of a surface alloy with a stable composition and structure. The formation of the alloy is explained by kinetic factors, particularly the fast diffusion of substrate atoms through gaps and defects in the deposited layer, which is a critical aspect for understanding the dynamics of bimetallic interfaces. 

LEED analysis is then employed to examine the composition of the first few atomic layers of the surface alloy. By comparing the experimental LEED patterns with theoretical calculations, researchers can determine the concentration of Ni and Pt in the top layers of the alloy. The analysis reveals that practically all deposited Ni remains within the first two surface layers after thermal treatment at 600 K. This finding is crucial for understanding the extent of interdiffusion and the stability of the surface alloy. 

The results from the LEED analysis are consistent with those from other techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPD) and low energy ion scattering (LEIS), providing a comprehensive picture of the surface alloy composition and confirming the accuracy of the calibration procedures used in these studies. The agreement between different experimental methods strengthens the confidence in the findings and contributes to a deeper understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces.

The study of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is pivotal for advancing surface science and catalysis research, as it provides insights into the behavior of bimetallic interfaces under various conditions. These insights are instrumental in designing materials with tailored properties for applications in catalysis, electronics, and other fields requiring precise control over material interfaces.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许研究人员精确控制并分析表面层的组成和结构。通过沉积一层Ni，科学家可以研究Ni和Pt原子之间的界面相互作用，这对于开发具有优化活性和选择性的催化剂非常重要。使用低能电子衍射（LEED）技术能够对表面层进行详细检查，提供有关双金属界面的深入见解，包括相稳定性、组成和结构属性。这些研究结果对新材料的发展做出了重大贡献，特别是那些具有增强催化性能的材料。

表征过程始于在Pt(111)表面上沉积单原子层的Ni。之后，样品在高温下进行退火，通常为600 K，以诱导Ni和Pt原子之间的扩散。这种扩散导致表面合金的形成，该合金具有稳定的组成和结构。合金形成的动力学因素是关键，尤其是通过沉积层中的间隙和缺陷快速扩散基体原子，这有助于理解双金属界面的动力学。

然后利用LEED分析来检查表面合金的前几层的组成。通过将实验LEED图案与理论计算进行比较，研究人员可以确定顶部层中Ni和Pt的浓度。分析显示，所有沉积的Ni基本上保留在600 K热处理后的前两层表面层中。这一发现对于理解扩散程度和表面合金稳定性的深度至关重要。

LEED分析的结果与X射线光电子谱(XPD)和低能离子散射(LEIS)等其他技术的结果一致，提供了全面的图像，确认了这些研究中使用的校准程序的准确性。不同实验方法之间的一致性增强了研究结果的信心，并促进了对双金属表面电子和化学性质的深入了解。

研究Ni/Pt双金属表面对于推进表面科学和催化研究至关重要，因为它提供了有关双金属界面在各种条件下的行为的见解。这些见解对于设计具有定制特性的材料用于催化、电子和其他需要精确控制材料界面的应用领域至关重要。

2.2. LEED crystallographic analysis
The LEED intensity versus potential curves (I-V curves) was measured by means of a video LEED system at normal incidence (0 = 0 ) and at 0 = 10 
in the (121) direction. The condition of normal incidence of the primary electron beam was deter- mined from the comparison of the I-V curves of the symmetrically equivalent beams. The minor residual differences in equivalent I-V curves were compen- sated by averaging. In the calculations, the off-norm- al incidence angle was also varied in steps of + 0.5 around the value of 10 in order to determine a possible inaccuracy of the goniometer, but the best agreement for the optimized model was found for an angle of 10 . 

3. Results and discussion
After room temperature deposition of amounts of cobalt of the order of one monolayer, the only change observed in the LEED pattern was an in- crease in the background and in the width of the diffracted spots of the substrate. The LEED struc- tural analysis of the (1 × 1) phase corresponding to a single atomic layer of cobalt has been reported in Ref. [4]. We found in this phase each cobalt atom
