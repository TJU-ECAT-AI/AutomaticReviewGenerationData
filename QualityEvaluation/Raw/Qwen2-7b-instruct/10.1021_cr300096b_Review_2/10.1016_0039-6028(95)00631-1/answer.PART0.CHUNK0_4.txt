[1] "The structure of systems formed depositing ultra-thin films of cobalt on platinum has been studied by various techniques [4-6] as well as the surface struc- ture of bulk Co-Pt alloys [7-10]."
[2] "When starting from a single layer of cobalt deposited on Pt(lll) we observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPD) [12] that diffusion of cobalt into the platinum bulk is limited to the two topmost surface layers only."
[3] "Measurements by low energy ion scattering (LEIS) [11,12] showed that the topmost layer in this phase is composed principally of platinum."
[4] "However, a direct measurement of the layer-by-layer composition was not possible by these techniques, and the LEIS results for the topmost layer needed to be quantified and verified by an independent technique."
[5] "Hence, in the present study we used quantitative low energy electron diffraction for this purpose."
[6] "LEED analysis has been shown to be able to determine the composition of the first few atomic layers of several alloys [13], including Co-Pt ones [7,8]."
[7] "The results of the present work confirm that the surface alloy at the Co/Pt(lll) interface is two atomic layers thick. The composition was found to be 20 at% cobalt in the topmost layer and 80 at% in the second."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The study utilizes techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPD), low energy ion scattering (LEIS), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to analyze the structure and composition of the surfaces. The LEED analysis is particularly useful for determining the composition of the first few atomic layers in alloys, confirming that the surface alloy at the Ni/Pt interface is two atomic layers thick, with the topmost layer containing 20 at% Ni and the second layer 80 at% Ni. This detailed characterization is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。研究使用技术如X射线光电子谱（XPD）、低能离子散射（LEIS）和低能电子衍射（LEED）来分析表面的结构和组成。LEED分析特别适用于确定合金中前几层原子的组成，证实Ni/Pt界面的表面合金为两层原子厚，其中顶层含20 at% Ni，第二层含80 at% Ni。这种详细的表征对于推进表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
