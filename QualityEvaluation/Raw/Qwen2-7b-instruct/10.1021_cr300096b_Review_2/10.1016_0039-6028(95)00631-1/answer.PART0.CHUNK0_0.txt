[1] "The cobalt atomic fraction was varied over the full possible range in steps of 5% using the ATA approximation."
[2] "In an initial phase of the calculations we considered the presence of cobalt only in the first two atomic layers from the surface."

[4] "The firStointerplanar spacing coincides with the value of 2.16 Å that can be obtained interpolating the bulk values for Pt25Co75 and Pt80Co20 [7,8] for an average composition of "PtsoCos0"."
[5] "The determination of the layer-by-layer composition was not possible by these techniques, and the LEIS results for the topmost layer needed to be quantified and verified by an independent technique."

1. The cobalt atomic fraction was varied in steps of 5% in the initial calculations.
2. The presence of cobalt was considered only in the first two atomic layers during the initial phase of the calculations.
3. The comparison between the calculated and experimental I-V curves is depicted in Figure 1.
4. The first interplanar spacing matches the 2.16 Å value obtained by interpolating the bulk values for Pt25Co75 and Pt80Co20, reflecting an average composition of "PtsoCos0".
5. The layer-by-layer composition could not be determined using the techniques mentioned, necessitating verification through an independent method.
6. The sensitivity of crystallographic LEED to the third layer's cobalt concentration was found to be low.

1. 在初始计算阶段，钴原子分数以5%的步长变化。
2. 初始阶段考虑了仅在表面前两层存在钴的情况。
3. 计算与实验I-V曲线的比较在图1中展示。
4. 第一个间距与通过插值获得的Pt25Co75和Pt80Co20的块体值相匹配，反映了一个平均组成“PtsoCos0”。
5. 提到的技术无法确定层间组成，需要通过独立技术进行量化和验证。
6. 对于第三层钴浓度，晶体学LEED的灵敏度较低。
