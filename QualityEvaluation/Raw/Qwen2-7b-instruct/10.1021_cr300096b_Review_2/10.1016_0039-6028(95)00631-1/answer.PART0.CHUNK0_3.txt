2.2. LEED crystallographic analysis
The LEED intensity versus potential curves (I-V curves) was measured by means of a video LEED system at normal incidence (0 = 0 ) and at 0 = 10 
in the (121) direction. The condition of normal incidence of the primary electron beam was deter- mined from the comparison of the I-V curves of the symmetrically equivalent beams. The minor residual differences in equivalent I-V curves were compen- sated by averaging. In the calculations, the off-norm- al incidence angle was also varied in steps of + 0.5 around the value of 10 in order to determine a possible inaccuracy of the goniometer, but the best agreement for the optimized model was found for an angle of 10 . 

3. Results and discussion
After room temperature deposition of amounts of cobalt of the order of one monolayer, the only change observed in the LEED pattern was an in- crease in the background and in the width of the diffracted spots of the substrate. The LEED struc- tural analysis of the (1 × 1) phase corresponding to a single atomic layer of cobalt has been reported in Ref. [4]. We found in this phase each cobalt atom

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows for precise control over the composition and structure at the atomic level. The use of LEED techniques enables detailed examination of the surface layers, providing insights into the interaction and distribution of metals at the interface. This information is essential for advancing the fields of surface science and catalysis research, where understanding the behavior of bimetallic surfaces under various conditions can lead to the development of more efficient catalysts and materials.
