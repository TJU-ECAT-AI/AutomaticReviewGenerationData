The structure of the Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O was prepared by dosing the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt surface with over a 100 L oxygen (100 s exposure at a pressure of 106 Torr) and annealing to 550 K. This exposure is chosen to be higher than the saturation exposure on clean Cu{1 0 0} to ensure that a saturation coverage on the alloy is achieved. Higher exposures produced the same result.

To characterize the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, a Ni monolayer is deposited on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface composition and structure, enabling detailed analysis through various techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

为了表征Ni/Pt双金属表面，首先在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它允许对表面组成和结构进行精确控制，从而通过各种技术如低能电子衍射（LEED）、原子力显微镜（AFM）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）进行详细分析。
