<p>The structure of the Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O was prepared by dosing the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt surface with over a 100 L oxygen (100 s exposure at a pressure of 106 Torr) and annealing to 550 K.</p>
<p>This exposure is chosen to be higher than the saturation exposure on clean Cu{1 0 0} to ensure that a saturation coverage on the alloy is achieved. Higher exposures produced the same result.</p>
<p>The structure and compositional profile of the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt 1 ML surface alloy has been determined by AlShamaileh et al.</p>
<p>For this phase, LEED I(V) measurements were acquired at room temperature under conditions of normal incidence using a CCD video camera and collecting data by automatic spot tracking.</p>
<p>The calculations ruled out simple p(2 × 2) overlayers in favour of an oxygen-induced surface reconstruction model that consists of a mixed c(2 × 2) CuPt underlayer below a reconstructed Cu{1 0 0} outermost layer with oxygen atoms occupying a slightly displaced fourfold hollow sites above second layer Pt atoms relative to the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt unreconstructed surface.</p>
<p>The minimum Pendry R-factor for the best model was 0.23.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface structure, composition, and interactions between Ni and Pt atoms. By understanding the surface structure and composition through methods like low energy electron diffraction (LEED), researchers can predict and optimize the catalytic activity and stability of these surfaces in various applications, such as hydrogen storage and conversion processes. The detailed characterization enables the identification of specific structural features that influence surface reactivity, facilitating the design of more efficient catalysts and surface modifications for enhanced performance in industrial processes.

The process of depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) or polycrystalline Pt substrates provides a controlled environment for studying the interplay between the two metals, which is essential for developing a comprehensive understanding of their properties.
