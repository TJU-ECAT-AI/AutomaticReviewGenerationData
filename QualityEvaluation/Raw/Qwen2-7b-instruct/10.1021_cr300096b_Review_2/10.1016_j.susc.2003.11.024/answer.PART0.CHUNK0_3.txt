<p>The structure of the Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O was prepared by dosing the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt surface with over a 100 L oxygen (100 s exposure at a pressure of 106 Torr) and annealing to 550 K.</p>
<p>This change of the surface structure and compositional profile of the surface alloy may be explained by the formation of CuO chains.</p>
<p>The calculations ruled out simple p(2 × 2) overlayers in favour of an oxygen-induced surface reconstruction model that consists of a mixed c(2 × 2) CuPt underlayer below a reconstructed Cu{1 0 0} outermost layer with oxygen atoms occupying a slightly displaced fourfold hollow sites above second layer Pt atoms relative to the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt unreconstructed surface.</p>
<p>The minimum Pendry R-factor for the best model was 0.23.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. By synthesizing the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, researchers can analyze the interaction between the two metals, which is essential for applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The structural modeling helps predict the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces under various conditions, while DFT calculations provide insights into the electronic structure and bonding mechanisms. Together, these approaches contribute to a holistic understanding of the bimetallic surfaces' properties and their potential applications.
