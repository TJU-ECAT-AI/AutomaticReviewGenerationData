<p>The adsorption of oxygen on Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt 1 ML surface alloy produces a p(2 × 2) surface structure which we describe as oxygen-induced reconstruction.</p>
<p>Recently, the structure and compositional profile of the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt 1 ML surface alloy has been determined by AlShamaileh et al.</p>
<p>The structure of the Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O was prepared by dosing the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt surface with over a 100 L oxygen (100 s exposure at a pressure of 106 Torr) and annealing to 550 K.</p>
<p>The calculations have been done using the Barbieri/Van Hove Symmetrised Automated Tensor LEED package [10] .</p>
<p>Atomic potentials for Cu, Pt and O were characterised using 11 phase shifts (lmax=10) obtained from the Barbieri/Van Hove Phase Shift package [11] .</p>
<p>The data was then normalised to constant incoming beam current.</p>
<p>With Rp=0.34, this preliminary search clearly favours only one structure in which oxygen adsorbs on fourfold hollow sites above of second layer Pt of a 25% decrease in surface Cu atoms density reconstruction model ( Fig. 1(b) ).</p>
<p>The use of the ATA approach resulted in a further reduction of the Pendry Rp-factor for the favoured model (final Rp=0.23).</p>
<p>The observed lateral displacements are a direct result of the LEED I(V) simulations.</p>
<p>Finally, the relatively high R-factor value (0.23) is considered reasonable for a system with three different atoms within the selvedge.</p>

This document details the investigation into the effects of oxygen adsorption on the structure of the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt 1 ML surface alloy. It explains how oxygen adsorption leads to a p(2 × 2) surface structure, known as oxygen-induced reconstruction. The study also outlines the preparation of the Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O structure through the dosing of oxygen onto the alloy surface and subsequent annealing. The characterization of the atomic potentials for copper, platinum, and oxygen was performed using the Barbieri/Van Hove Phase Shift package. The calculations utilized the Barbieri/Van Hove Symmetrised Automated Tensor LEED package to determine the structure of the alloy. The study also mentions the use of the average T-matrix approximation (ATA) for refining the compositional profile of the favored model. The document concludes with an explanation of the observed lateral displacements as a direct result of the LEED I(V) simulations and notes that the relatively high R-factor value (0.23) is considered reasonable for the system under study.

本文详细记录了对Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt 1 ML表面合金中氧吸附作用的研究。它解释了氧吸附如何导致p(2 × 2)表面结构，即氧诱导重构。研究还阐述了通过向合金表面注入氧气并随后退火来制备Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O结构的方法。使用Barbieri/Van Hove相移包对铜、铂和氧的原子势进行了表征。使用Barbieri/Van Hove对称自动张量LEED包对合金结构进行了计算。研究还提到了使用平均矩阵近似（ATA）来细化首选模型的组成轮廓。文档以解释观测到的横向位移是LEED I(V)模拟的直接结果，并指出相对较高的R因子值（0.23）对于研究系统而言是可以接受的结尾。
