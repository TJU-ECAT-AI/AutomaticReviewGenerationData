<p>The structure of the Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O was prepared by dosing the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt surface with over a 100 L oxygen (100 s exposure at a pressure of 106 Torr) and annealing to 550 K.</p>
<p>In the present study, the effect of oxygen adsorption on the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2 × 2)Pt 1 ML surface alloy structure is investigated.</p>
<p>The structure of the Pt/Cu{1 0 0}-(2 × 2)O has been determined by quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED) calculations using the symmetrised automated tensor LEED (SATLEED) program.</p>
<p>The calculations have been done using the Barbieri/Van Hove Symmetrised Automated Tensor LEED package [10] .</p>
<p>For each of the models, the first step of the calculations involved varying the three dimensional oxygen atom positions and also varying the atomic positions of the first substrate layer.</p>
<p>The calculations revealed a small lateral displacement of 0.05  0.06 Å, observed in the topmost layer copper atoms whereas larger values of 0.23  0.12 Å and 0.11  0.12 Å were observed for the second layer platinum atoms.</p>
<p>Oxygen atoms were found to be displaced by 0.8  0.2 Å within the plane of the topmost layer towards the position of the missing surface Cu atom as illustrated in Fig. 2(a).</p>
<p>Using low energy ion scattering, recoiling spectrometry and low energy electron diffraction, Shen et al. have studied the oxygen induced (2 × 1) reconstruction of Cu3Pt{1 1 0} [14] .</p>
<p>The symmetry of the unreconstructed CuPt(1 0 0) underlayer alloy is p4mm. For the different top layer reconstruction models tested in this study, the surface symmetry is reduced to either p2mm or p2.</p>
