The earliest study of the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt system was carried out by Graham et al. using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) illustrating that Pt grows at room temperature in a somewhat disordered overlayer as Pt clusters with some intermixing with the underlying Cu substrate.
In contrast, Shen et al., using a combination of He+ and Li+ LEISS, report that thermal activation of a 1 ML Pt film to the slightly lower temperature of 450 K for 10 min led to formation of a c(2×2) structure with adjacent layers with Pt concentrations of 46 and 41 at.% in layers 1 and 2 respectively and a mixed bimetallic layer outermost.
It would appear that low temperature thermal activation (450 K) lead to surfaces with considerable Pt content in the outermost layer, while high temperature (525 K) annealing leads to surfaces with a pure or almost pure Cu termination at low Pt loadings.
Clearly the compositional profile of the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy with Pt loading of around 1 ML is highly sensitive to the thermal treatment utilised.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates typically involves a combination of techniques including AES, LEISS, and LEED. These methods allow researchers to understand the structure and composition of the bimetallic surfaces, which is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehending the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The sensitivity of the compositional profile to thermal treatments indicates that careful control of the synthesis conditions is essential to achieve desired properties.
