[1] "To date no quantitative structural work has been carried out on the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt bimetallic interface."
[2] "In this paper we report the results of a TLEED-ATA analysis of a Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy formed by high temperature (550 K) thermal activation of Pt films of monolayer coverage, illustrating that the c(2×2) periodicity arises from chemical ordering in a mixed CuPt underlayer with an essentially Cu-terminated surface with a concentration profile similar to the outer bilayer of a Cu3Pt{1 0 0} bulk alloy surface which itself adopts a Cu terminated L12 structure consisting of alternate layers of pure Cu and c(2×2) CuPt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows scientists to understand the precise arrangement of atoms at the surface. By studying the structural properties, researchers can conduct Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to predict the electronic and chemical behaviors of these surfaces. This knowledge is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, enabling the design of materials with optimized performance for various applications.
