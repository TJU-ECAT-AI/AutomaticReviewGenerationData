[1] "The geometric structure and compositional profile of a Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy formed by thermal activation of a monolayer Pt film has been determined by tensor low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[2] "The bimetallic combination Cu{1 0 0}/Pd is one of the best studied examples of surface alloy formation."
[3] "The earliest study of the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt system was carried out by Graham et al. using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[4] "Introduction of Pt into the surface layers induces a significant expansion of the selvedge yielding modification of the outermost three interlayer spacings to 1.840.02 Å (Δdz12=+1.91.1%), 1.910.03 Å (Δdz23=+5.81.7%) and 1.890.03 Å (Δdz34=+4.71.7%)."
[5] "The layerwise compositional profile has been extracted via ATA modelling resulting in an almost pure outermost copper monolayer with only a small Pt impurity concentration (1010 at.%)."

How is the characterization of Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt bimetallic surfaces conducted?

The characterization of Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted using tensor low energy electron diffraction (LEED) to determine their geometric structure and compositional profile. The process involves thermal activation of a monolayer Pt film followed by the use of LEED to analyze the surface. This method is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

如何表征Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt双金属表面？

Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt双金属表面的表征通过张量低能电子衍射（LEED）进行，以确定其几何结构和组成轮廓。该过程包括对单层Pt薄膜进行热激活，随后使用LEED分析表面。此方法对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。
