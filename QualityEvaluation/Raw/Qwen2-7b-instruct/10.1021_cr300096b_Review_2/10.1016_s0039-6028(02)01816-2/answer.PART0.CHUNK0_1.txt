<p>The earliest study of the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt system was carried out by Graham et al. using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) illustrating that Pt grows at room temperature in a somewhat disordered overlayer as Pt clusters with some intermixing with the underlying Cu substrate.</p>
<p>Auger spectroscopy was used to calibrate the Pt surface coverage via comparison of the AES intensities of Pt and Cu to those of Au and Cu from the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Au surface alloy (ΘAu=0.5 ML).</p>
<p>It would appear that low temperature thermal activation (450 K) lead to surfaces with considerable Pt content in the outermost layer, while high temperature (525 K) annealing leads to surfaces with a pure or almost pure Cu termination at low Pt loadings.</p>
<p>Once formed, the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt alloy is stable for prolonged operation temperatures below 500 K and as such is useful to probe the effect of surface alloying of Cu and Pt on a range of reactions including hydrocarbon reforming, CO oxidation and methanol synthesis.</p>
<p>To date no quantitative structural work has been carried out on the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt bimetallic interface.</p>
<p>In this paper we report the results of a TLEED-ATA analysis of a Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy formed by high temperature (550 K) thermal activation of Pt films of monolayer coverage, illustrating that the c(2×2) periodicity arises from chemical ordering in a mixed CuPt underlayer with an essentially Cu-terminated surface.</p>

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates typically involves the use of techniques like low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS). This process is crucial because it allows for the detailed structural modeling and computational simulations, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. These properties are essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic processes.

The paper focuses on the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy, showing that it forms a copper capped bimetallic surface localized alloy with a subsurface ordered c(2×2) CuPt layer. The layerwise compositional profile indicates an almost pure outermost copper monolayer with a small Pt impurity concentration, layers 3 and 4 containing higher Pt concentrations. Substitution of platinum into the selvedge results in a significant expansion of the surface interlayer spacings and modifies the weak oscillatory relaxation of clean Cu{1 0 0} to a strongly and non-uniformly expanded interlayer separation.

对由在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征通常涉及低能电子衍射（LEED）、Auger电子能谱（AES）和低能离子散射光谱（LEISS）等技术。这一过程至关重要，因为它允许进行详细的结构建模和计算模拟，例如密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，从而提供了这些表面的电子和化学性质的洞察。这些性质对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要，影响催化过程的效率和选择性。

该论文关注于Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt表面合金，显示它形成了一种铜帽的双金属表面局部合金，其下表面有序的c(2×2) CuPt层。层间组成轮廓表明最外层为几乎纯铜单层，含有少量铂杂质，而第3层和第4层含较高浓度的铂。将铂替换到边缘区域会导致表面层间距显著扩大，并将干净的Cu{1 0 0}的弱振荡松弛修改为强烈且非均匀的层间距扩大。
