<p>It would appear that low temperature thermal activation (450 K) lead to surfaces with considerable Pt content in the outermost layer, while high temperature (525 K) annealing leads to surfaces with a pure or almost pure Cu termination at low Pt loadings.</p>
<p>The primary technique involved in this study was LEISS which is sensitive to atomic composition.</p>
<p>Reports of formation of a Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy with Pt loading of 1 ML via annealing to the lower temperature of 450 K in which significant quantities of Pt are present in both layer 1 (46 at.%) and layer 2 (41 at.%) clearly indicate the possibility of formation of a second metastable ordered surface alloy.</p>
<p>A copper capped geometry is in full agreement with the ion scattering studies of Graham et al. who have determined the surface of a Cu{1 0 0} doped with Pt and thermally processed to 525 K to be essentially copper terminated upto Pt loadings of 1 ML.</p>
<p>To date no quantitative structural work has been carried out on the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt bimetallic interface.</p>
<p>The layerwise compositional profile has been extracted via ATA modelling resulting in an almost pure outermost copper monolayer with only a small Pt impurity concentration (1010 at.%).</p>
<p>Substitution of platinum into the selvedge results in a significant expansion in the surface interlayer spacings and switches the weak oscillatory relaxation of clean Cu{1 0 0} to a strongly and non-uniformly expanded interlayer separation.</p>
<p>The outermost three interlayer spacings are strongly expanded to 1.840.02 Å (+1.91.1%), 1.910.03 Å (+5.81.7%) and 1.890.03 Å (+4.71.7%) respectively.</p>
<p>A slight rippling occurs in the c(2×2) CuPt underlayer of amplitude 0.030.04 Å, with Pt atoms rippled outwards towards the vacuum interface within the composite layer.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows for the precise control of the surface composition and structure, enabling detailed analysis of the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. DFT calculations can then be employed to understand the interactions and energetics of the bimetallic system, providing insights into its catalytic activity and stability. Our comprehensive understanding of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research is greatly enhanced by these techniques, allowing for the design of more efficient and selective catalysts.

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates typically involves the use of techniques like low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and low-energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS). This process is crucial because it allows for the detailed structural modeling and computational simulations, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. These properties are essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research, influencing the efficiency and selectivity of catalytic processes.

The paper focuses on the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy, showing that it forms a copper capped bimetallic surface localized alloy with a subsurface ordered c(2×2) CuPt layer. The layerwise compositional profile indicates an almost pure outermost copper monolayer with a small Pt impurity concentration, layers 3 and 4 containing higher Pt concentrations. Substitution of platinum into the selvedge results in a significant expansion of the surface interlayer spacings and modifies the weak oscillatory relaxation of clean Cu{1 0 0} to a strongly and non-uniformly expanded interlayer separation.

The earliest study of the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt system was carried out by Graham et al. using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEISS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) illustrating that Pt grows at room temperature in a somewhat disordered overlayer as Pt clusters with some intermixing with the underlying Cu substrate.
In contrast, Shen et al., using a combination of He+ and Li+ LEISS, report that thermal activation of a 1 ML Pt film to the slightly lower temperature of 450 K for 10 min led to formation of a c(2×2) structure with adjacent layers with Pt concentrations of 46 and 41 at.% in layers 1 and 2 respectively and a mixed bimetallic layer outermost.
It would appear that low temperature thermal activation (450 K) lead to surfaces with considerable Pt content in the outermost layer, while high temperature (525 K) annealing leads to surfaces with a pure or almost pure Cu termination at low Pt loadings.
Clearly the compositional profile of the Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy with Pt loading of around 1 ML is highly sensitive to the thermal treatment utilised.
