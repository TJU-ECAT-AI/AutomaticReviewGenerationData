<p>It would appear that low temperature thermal activation (450 K) lead to surfaces with considerable Pt content in the outermost layer, while high temperature (525 K) annealing leads to surfaces with a pure or almost pure Cu termination at low Pt loadings.</p>
<p>The primary technique involved in this study was LEISS which is sensitive to atomic composition.</p>
<p>Reports of formation of a Cu{1 0 0}-c(2×2)-Pt surface alloy with Pt loading of 1 ML via annealing to the lower temperature of 450 K in which significant quantities of Pt are present in both layer 1 (46 at.%) and layer 2 (41 at.%) clearly indicate the possibility of formation of a second metastable ordered surface alloy.</p>
<p>A copper capped geometry is in full agreement with the ion scattering studies of Graham et al. who have determined the surface of a Cu{1 0 0} doped with Pt and thermally processed to 525 K to be essentially copper terminated upto Pt loadings of 1 ML.</p>
<p>To date no quantitative structural work has been carried out on the Cu{1 0 0}/Pt bimetallic interface.</p>
<p>The layerwise compositional profile has been extracted via ATA modelling resulting in an almost pure outermost copper monolayer with only a small Pt impurity concentration (1010 at.%).</p>
<p>Substitution of platinum into the selvedge results in a significant expansion in the surface interlayer spacings and switches the weak oscillatory relaxation of clean Cu{1 0 0} to a strongly and non-uniformly expanded interlayer separation.</p>
<p>The outermost three interlayer spacings are strongly expanded to 1.840.02 Å (+1.91.1%), 1.910.03 Å (+5.81.7%) and 1.890.03 Å (+4.71.7%) respectively.</p>
<p>A slight rippling occurs in the c(2×2) CuPt underlayer of amplitude 0.030.04 Å, with Pt atoms rippled outwards towards the vacuum interface within the composite layer.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows for the precise control of the surface composition and structure, enabling detailed analysis of the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. DFT calculations can then be employed to understand the interactions and energetics of the bimetallic system, providing insights into its catalytic activity and stability. Our comprehensive understanding of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research is greatly enhanced by these techniques, allowing for the design of more efficient and selective catalysts.
