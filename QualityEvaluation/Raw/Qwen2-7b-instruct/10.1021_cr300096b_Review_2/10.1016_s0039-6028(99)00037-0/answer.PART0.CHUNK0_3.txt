[1] "The 2D growth mode and the disperse distribution of Pt atoms in the surface suggested by PAX are thus confirmed by STM."
[2] "The Pt coverage found by AES is in good agreement with the one found by STM. Thus Pt atoms are embedded only in the topmost layer and only a small fraction of Pt forms an alloy in deeper substrate layers at high coverages greater than 0.9 ML."
[3] "In STM images with atomic resolution, the Rh atoms appear higher than the Pt atoms in the surface alloy as in the case of PtRh bulk alloys."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for detailed analysis of the surface structure, composition, and interactions between Ni and Pt atoms. The use of techniques such as AES, UPS, ISS, and STM enables researchers to determine the precise location and distribution of Ni and Pt atoms, as well as their electronic states, which are essential for predicting and optimizing the catalytic activity and stability of these surfaces in various applications.
