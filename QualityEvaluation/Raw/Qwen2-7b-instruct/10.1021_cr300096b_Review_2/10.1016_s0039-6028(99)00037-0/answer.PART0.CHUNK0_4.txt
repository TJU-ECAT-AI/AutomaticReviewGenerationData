[1] "The system Rh/Pt is of wide technological interest as an important industrial catalyst, e.g. for the production of nitric acid and hydrogen cyanide."
[2] "The main application of this system is, however, the three-way catalyst, which is used for purification of exhaust gases of gasoline-fueled internal combustion engines."
[3] "On the other hand theoretical interest arises because of the peculiar segregation behavior of Pt/Rh bulk alloys."
[4] "Our first aim was to investigate the growth mode."
[5] "AES was used to check the cleanness of the surface and the Pt film. Traces of CO were monitored by UPS."
[6] "The 2D growth mode and the disperse distribution of Pt atoms in the surface suggested by PAX are thus confirmed by STM."
[7] "Up to 1 ML Pt there is a linear dependence as expected for a 2D growth mode."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves a series of analytical techniques such as AES, UPS, ISS, and STM. These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process enables detailed insights into the surface morphology, bonding, and catalytic activity of the bimetallic system.

In the context of the Rh/Pt system, AES and UPS are employed to assess the cleanliness of the surface and monitor the presence of impurities like CO. STM provides atomically resolved images that confirm the disperse distribution of Pt atoms within the first substrate layer. The linear dependence observed for Pt coverages up to 1 ML supports the 2D growth mode, which is consistent with the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.

These methodologies offer a robust framework for understanding the structure-property relationships in bimetallic systems, facilitating the development of advanced catalysts with optimized performance for industrial applications.

在合成Ni/Pt双金属表面时，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层，采用一系列分析技术如AES、UPS、ISS和STM进行表征。这些方法对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对先进表面科学和催化研究中双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行全面理解至关重要。

此过程提供了深入了解双金属体系表面形态、键合和催化活性的详细信息。在Rh/Pt系统中，AES和UPS用于评估表面清洁度并监控CO等杂质的存在。STM提供原子级分辨率的图像，证实了表面中Pt原子的分散分布。观察到的覆盖度线性依赖关系支持2D生长模式，这与Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征一致。

这些方法为理解双金属体系的结构-性能关系提供了坚实的基础，促进了具有优化性能的先进催化剂的发展。
