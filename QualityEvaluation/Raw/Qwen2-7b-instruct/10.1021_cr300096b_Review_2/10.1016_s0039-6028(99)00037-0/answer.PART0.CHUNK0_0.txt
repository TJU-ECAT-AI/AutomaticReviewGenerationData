[1] "The 2D growth mode and the disperse distribution of Pt atoms in the surface suggested by PAX are thus confirmed by STM."
[2] "The interaction of CO with the surfaces of the two pure metals Rh and Pt has been thoroughly investigated (e.g. [14] ,[15] ,[16])."
[3] "The clear distinction between the two peak systems is surprising in some respects."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it enables structural modeling and DFT calculations by creating a controlled environment where the properties of the bimetallic interface can be precisely analyzed. Secondly, it aids in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, which are essential for advancing the fields of surface science and catalysis research. By systematically varying the deposition conditions and analyzing the resulting surface properties, researchers can optimize the composition and structure of these materials for specific applications.
