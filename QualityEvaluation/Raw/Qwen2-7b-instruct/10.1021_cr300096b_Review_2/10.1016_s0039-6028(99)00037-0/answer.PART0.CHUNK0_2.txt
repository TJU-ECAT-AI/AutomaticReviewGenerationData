[1] "The system Rh/Pt is of wide technological interest as an important industrial catalyst, e.g. for the production of nitric acid and hydrogen cyanide."
[2] "The experiments were carried out in two different UHV chambers."
[3] "AES was used to check the cleanness of the surface and the Pt film. Traces of CO were monitored by UPS."
[4] "The deposition of different amounts of platinum leads to a continuous shift of the Xe-induced signals to lower binding energy (Fig. 2)."
[5] "The interaction of CO with the surfaces of the two pure metals Rh and Pt has been thoroughly investigated (e.g. [14], [15], [16])."
[6] "Because of the clear separation of the CO-induced emissions, a quantitative evaluation was possible."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves utilizing techniques such as AES (Auger Electron Spectroscopy), UPS (Unresolved Binding Energy Spectroscopy), ISS (Ion Scattering Spectroscopy), and STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscopy). These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The process enables researchers to determine the precise distribution and bonding characteristics of the metals on the surface, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
