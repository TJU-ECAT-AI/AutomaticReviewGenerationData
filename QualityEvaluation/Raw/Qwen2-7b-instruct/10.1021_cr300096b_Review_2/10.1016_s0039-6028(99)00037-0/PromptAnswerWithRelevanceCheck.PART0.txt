The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves a series of analytical techniques such as AES, UPS, ISS, and STM. These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process enables detailed insights into the surface morphology, bonding, and catalytic activity of the bimetallic system.

In the context of the Rh/Pt system, AES and UPS are employed to assess the cleanliness of the surface and monitor the presence of impurities like CO. STM provides atomically resolved images that confirm the disperse distribution of Pt atoms within the first substrate layer. The linear dependence observed for Pt coverages up to 1 ML supports the 2D growth mode, which is consistent with the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces.

These methodologies offer a robust framework for understanding the structure-property relationships in bimetallic systems, facilitating the development of advanced catalysts with optimized performance for industrial applications.
