<p>Photoemission spectra of CO (CO-covered minus bare or Pt-covered surface) at different amounts of Pt on the surface are shown in Fig. 4 . The CO-induced emissions at saturation coverage show striking differences in peak position and shape.</p>
<p>Additionally the Pt fraction measured by CO titration versus deposition time is shown in Fig. 4 .</p>
<p>Up to 1 ML Pt there is a linear dependence as expected for a 2D growth mode. At higher coverage no Rh fraction is found.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces comprehensively. The use of photoemission spectroscopy, particularly in the context of CO titration, enables the quantification of the Pt fraction present on the surface, providing insights into the bimetallic interface and its behavior under various conditions.
