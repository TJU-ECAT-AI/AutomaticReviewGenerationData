Vibrational spectroscopy of CO used as a local probe to study the surface morphology of Pt on Ru( ) in the submonolayer regime.
While the morphology of the Pt deposit is pictured by STM images, IRAS allows us to correlate the shift of the internal CO vibrating frequency sensitively with the local binding configuration.
By annealing the sample from the deposition temperature of 80 K to 350 K, the binding energy of CO to PtRu step sites is reduced significantly.
This is explained by the transition of the Pt island shape and size from single atoms and small clusters at low temperatures to larger Pt islands at room temperature.
Infrared spectroscopy of molecules like CO is known to be very selective not only with respect to the type and local geometry of substrate atoms, but also to changes of the local chemical environment.
To ensure that the change in morphology is not influenced by CO on the surface, a complete series of experiments was performed with the sample being annealed to 500 K before CO adsorption, without any noticeable difference.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The selective nature of vibrational spectroscopy, such as infrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), enables researchers to correlate the shift in the internal CO vibrating frequency with the local binding configuration, providing insights into the surface morphology and chemical environment. Annealing the sample from a low temperature of 80 K to room temperature facilitates the transition of the Pt island shape and size, impacting the binding energy of CO to the surface. By performing experiments with the sample annealed to 500 K before CO adsorption, researchers ensure that any observed changes in CO binding are due to morphological transformations rather than surface contamination or adsorbate effects.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。振动光谱选择性的特性，如红外吸收光谱（IRAS），允许研究者通过敏感地关联CO内部振动频率的偏移与局部结合配置，从而提供关于表面形态和化学环境的见解。通过对样品从低温80 K加热至室温的过程，可以观察到Pt岛形状和大小的变化，进而影响CO在表面的结合能。通过在CO吸附前将样品加热至500 K的实验，研究人员确保了观察到的CO结合变化是由形态转变引起的，而不是表面污染或吸附剂效应的影响。
