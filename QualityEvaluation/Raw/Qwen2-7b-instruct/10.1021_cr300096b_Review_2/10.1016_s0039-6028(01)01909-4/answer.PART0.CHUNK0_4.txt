3. "Since it has been possible to discriminate between CO on Ru(0 0 1) (ω=1990 cm1), CO on terraces of Pt/Ru(0 0 1) islands (ω=2085 cm1) and CO at PtRu step sites (ω=20332050 cm1), an explicit picture of changes in binding energy of CO related to morphology was developed. Pt atoms and step atoms of small Pt clusters bind CO more strongly than Ru(0 0 1) does. In contrast, at bigger, more compact Pt islands with straight steps the binding energy of CO at PtRu steps is lower than on Ru(0 0 1)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It enables researchers to distinguish between the different types of binding sites for CO, such as CO on Ru(0 0 1), CO on terraces of Pt/Ru(0 0 1) islands, and CO at PtRu step sites. The binding energy of CO varies depending on the local structure of the surface, with Pt atoms and step atoms of small Pt clusters binding CO more strongly than Ru(0 0 1). However, at bigger, more compact Pt islands with straight steps, the binding energy of CO at PtRu steps is lower than on Ru(0 0 1). This detailed information contributes to the understanding of how CO interacts with these surfaces, which is particularly important for the development of CO-tolerant anode materials in direct methanol fuel cells.

对于Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层进行。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。它使研究人员能够区分CO在Ru(0 0 1)、Pt/Ru(0 0 1)岛上的台阶以及PtRu台阶上的不同吸附位点。CO的结合能根据表面的局部结构而变化，Pt原子和小Pt簇的台阶原子比Ru(0 0 1)更强烈地结合CO。然而，在更大、更紧凑的Pt岛屿上，具有直台阶的台阶上的CO结合能在PtRu台阶上低于Ru(0 0 1)。这些详细信息有助于了解CO与这些表面的相互作用，这对于直接甲醇燃料电池中CO耐受性阳极材料的发展特别重要。
