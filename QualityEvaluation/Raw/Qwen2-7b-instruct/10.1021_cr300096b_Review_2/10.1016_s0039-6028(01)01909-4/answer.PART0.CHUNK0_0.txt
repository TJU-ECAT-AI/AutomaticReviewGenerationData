[1] "Since it has been possible to discriminate between CO on Ru(0 0 1) (ω=1990 cm1), CO on terraces of Pt/Ru(0 0 1) islands (ω=2085 cm1) and CO at PtRu step sites (ω=20332050 cm1), an explicit picture of changes in binding energy of CO related to morphology was developed."
[2] "This attraction of CO to Ru on well annealed surfaces might be one reason why PtRu bimetallic anodes show an enhanced CO tolerance in the direct methanol fuel cell."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The differentiation between CO adsorption on Ru(0 0 1), terraces of Pt/Ru(0 0 1) islands, and PtRu step sites through infrared spectroscopy provides insights into the changes in binding energy of CO related to the morphology of the surface. The enhanced CO tolerance of PtRu bimetallic anodes in direct methanol fuel cells might be attributed to the stronger attraction of CO to the Ru component on well-annealed surfaces.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。通过红外光谱法区分CO吸附在Ru(0 0 1)、Pt/Ru(0 0 1)岛的台阶以及PtRu台阶位点，为了解与表面形态变化相关的CO结合能变化提供了线索。直接甲醇燃料电池中，PtRu双金属阳极表现出增强的CO耐受性可能归因于在热处理良好的表面上，CO对Ru成分的更强吸引力。
