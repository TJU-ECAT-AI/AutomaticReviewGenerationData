3. "Since it has been possible to discriminate between CO on Ru(0 0 1) (ω=1990 cm1), CO on terraces of Pt/Ru(0 0 1) islands (ω=2085 cm1) and CO at PtRu step sites (ω=20332050 cm1), an explicit picture of changes in binding energy of CO related to morphology was developed."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to distinguish between the binding configurations of CO on different parts of the surface. By identifying distinct vibrational frequencies of CO adsorption, scientists can correlate these with the local geometry and structure of the surface, providing insights into how the bimetallic composition influences the reactivity and stability of CO on the surface.
