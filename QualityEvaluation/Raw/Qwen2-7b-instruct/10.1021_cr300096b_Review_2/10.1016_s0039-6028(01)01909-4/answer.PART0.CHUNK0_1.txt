[1] "Since it has been possible to discriminate between CO on Ru(0 0 1) (ω=1990 cm1), CO on terraces of Pt/Ru(0 0 1) islands (ω=2085 cm1) and CO at PtRu step sites (ω=20332050 cm1), an explicit picture of changes in binding energy of CO related to morphology was developed."

Answer: Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The discrimination of CO binding sites provides insights into the morphology and binding energies, which are essential for optimizing the performance of Ni/Pt catalysts in fuel cells and other applications.

1. 尼/铂双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶铂(111)或多晶铂基底上沉积一层镍单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，特别是在先进表面科学和催化研究领域。通过区分CO吸附位点，可以深入了解形貌和吸附能的变化，这对于优化镍/铂催化剂在燃料电池等应用中的性能至关重要。
