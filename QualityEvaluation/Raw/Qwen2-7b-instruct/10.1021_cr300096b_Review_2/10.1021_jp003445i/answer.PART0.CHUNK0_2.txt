<p>The acetylene chemisorption bond energy, estimated by the acetylene desorption activation energy measured in TPD, also decreased (4565%) as the alloyed Sn concentration increased.</p>
<p>No benzene desorption was found on the c(2 × 2) alloy.</p>
<p>The amount of acetylene adsorbed in the chemisorbed layer at 100 K is decreased due to the presence of alloyed Sn.</p>
<p>The initial sticking coefficient of acetylene on Pt(100) at 100 K is reduced by a factor of 2 when forming the c(2 × 2) alloy.</p>
<p>Comparative studies of adsorption and reaction of acetylene on a c(2 × 2) Sn adlayer on Pt(100), with θSn = 0.5, demonstrate the importance of the position of Sn, in the adlayer or incorporated into the surface plane, in controlling site blocking.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, typically involves examining their structural properties and electronic configurations. This process is crucial for understanding the surface's reactivity, stability, and potential applications in catalysis. The synthesis method allows researchers to control the composition and structure of the bimetallic interface, which significantly influences the surface's chemical and physical properties. Structural modeling, such as using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM), helps visualize the atomic arrangement and identify the precise location of Ni atoms on the Pt surface. DFT calculations can then be employed to predict electronic states, bond strengths, and reactivity patterns at the interface. This comprehensive understanding is essential for optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific chemical reactions, enhancing their efficiency and selectivity in various industrial processes.
