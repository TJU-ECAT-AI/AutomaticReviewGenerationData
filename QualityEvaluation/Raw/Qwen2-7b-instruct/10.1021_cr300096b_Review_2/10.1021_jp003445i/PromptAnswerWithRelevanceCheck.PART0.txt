[1] "We have previously studied C2H2 adsorption and reaction on two ordered, PtSn surface alloys formed on Pt(111). These alloys have (2 × 2) and (3×3)R30 unit cells, with θSn = 0.25 and 0.33 ML in the outermost layer, respectively. 24,25 Decomposition of acetylene was strongly suppressed by alloying Sn in the surface layer of Pt(111), and benzene desorption was observed on both alloys.20"

These alloys have c(2 × 2) and (32×2)R45 unit cells, with θSn = 0.5 and 0.67 ML, respectively, in the topmost layer. 27,28"

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, typically involves studying the structure of the deposited Ni layer and its interaction with the underlying Pt surface. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The synthesized surfaces are often characterized using techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) to understand the precise arrangement of atoms and the electronic structure of the bimetallic interface. These detailed characterizations enable researchers to predict the catalytic performance of the surfaces and optimize them for various applications in catalysis and surface science.

2. The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process allows for the creation of a controlled interface between Ni and Pt, which can significantly alter the catalytic properties of both metals individually. The resulting bimetallic surfaces exhibit unique electronic and chemical properties due to the interaction between Ni and Pt atoms at the interface. These properties can be exploited in various catalytic applications, such as hydrogen production, oxidation reactions, and other chemical transformations.

3. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces typically involves a variety of techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to determine the crystalline structure of the deposited Ni layer and its interaction with the underlying Pt surface. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) provides high-resolution images of the atomic structure, allowing for the observation of the interface morphology and the distribution of Ni and Pt atoms. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) offers insights into the electronic structure of the bimetallic surface, revealing the changes in the density of states and band gaps that can affect the catalytic activity. These techniques collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surface properties and their implications for catalysis research.

4. The adsorption energy of acetylene on (111) and (100) Pt surfaces, estimated using the QVB theory by Koel and Carter, aligns well with the predicted sp2.5 adsorption energy of 54 kcal/mol. This agreement validates the theoretical approach used to estimate the adsorption energies and highlights the importance of considering the sp3 and sp2 hybridization states of carbon atoms when predicting the adsorption characteristics of molecules on Pt surfaces. The PtC covalent σ-bond strength of 53 kcal/mol serves as a reference point for estimating the energy required for acetylene to bind to the Pt surface.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, typically involves examining their structural properties and electronic configurations. This process is crucial for understanding the surface's reactivity, stability, and potential applications in catalysis. The synthesis method allows researchers to control the composition and structure of the bimetallic interface, which significantly influences the surface's chemical and physical properties. Structural modeling, such as using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) or atomic force microscopy (AFM), helps visualize the atomic arrangement and identify the precise location of Ni atoms on the Pt surface. DFT calculations can then be employed to predict electronic states, bond strengths, and reactivity patterns at the interface. This comprehensive understanding is essential for optimizing bimetallic catalysts for specific chemical reactions, enhancing their efficiency and selectivity in various industrial processes.
