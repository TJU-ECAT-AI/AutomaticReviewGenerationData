1. The study involved analyzing adsorption and reaction of acetylene on two ordered PtSn surface alloys formed on Pt(111). These alloys have unit cells of (2 × 2) and (3×3)R30, with the outermost layer having 0.25 and 0.33 ML of Sn respectively.
2. In the c(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(100) alloy, each Pt atom is surrounded by only Sn atoms, creating a checkerboard pattern of isolated Pt atoms.
3. Alloying Sn in the surface layer of Pt(111) significantly suppressed the decomposition of acetylene and facilitated benzene desorption.
4. XPS was employed in the annealing studies on the 32 alloy to estimate the amount of benzene desorption.
5. Research has been conducted on acetylene adsorption and reaction on Pt(111) and two Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys, one with θSn = 0.25 and the other with θSn = 0.33 ML. Alloying with Sn increased the molecular desorption of acetylene and hindered decomposition.
6. The minute changes observed in the Pt valence levels through UPS and core levels XPS indicate that the impact of Sn can be attributed to ensemble effects.

1. 研究涉及分析在Pt(111)上形成的两个有序PtSn表面合金上乙炔的吸附和反应。这些合金具有(2 × 2)和(3×3)R30单元格，外层分别含有0.25和0.33 ML的Sn。
2. 在c(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(100)合金中，每个Pt原子仅被Sn原子包围，形成孤立的Pt原子与周围Sn原子构成的棋盘状模式。
3. 在Pt(111)表面层中添加Sn显著抑制了乙炔的分解，并促进了苯的脱附。
4. XPS被用于在32合金上的退火研究，以估算苯的脱附量。
5. 对于在Pt(111)和两个Sn/Pt(111)表面合金上进行乙炔吸附和反应的研究，一个具有θSn = 0.25，另一个具有θSn = 0.33 ML。添加Sn增加了乙炔的分子脱附并阻碍了分解。
6. 通过UPS和核心水平XPS观察到的Pt价态变化微小，表明Sn的影响可以归因于簇集效应。
