The acetylene nearly completely decomposed during TPD on Pt(100) in the absence of Sn, forming hydrogen, which then desorbs as H2, and surface carbon.
Additionally, 15% of the adsorbed acetylene monolayer was converted to gaseous benzene during TPD on the (32×2)R45 Sn/Pt(100) alloy.
No such benzene desorption occurred from the c(2 × 2) alloy.

The presence of Sn on the surface significantly affects the decomposition of acetylene. On the Pt(100) surface without Sn, acetylene almost completely decomposes, releasing hydrogen and surface carbon. On the c(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(100) alloy, acetylene decomposition is strongly suppressed, but on the (32×2)R45 Sn/Pt(100) alloy, 15% of the adsorbed acetylene monolayer is converted to gaseous benzene during thermal desorption.

Sn的存在对乙炔的分解有显著影响。在没有Sn的Pt(100)表面，乙炔几乎完全分解，释放出氢气和表面碳。在c(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(100)合金上，乙炔分解受到强烈抑制，但在(32×2)R45 Sn/Pt(100)合金上，15%的吸附乙炔单层在热解过程中转化为气体苯。

Acetylene chemisorption on these Sn/Pt alloyed surfaces is fairly structure insensitive, whereas acetylene decomposition is structure sensitive, and we propose that an ensemble of at least two contiguous Pt atoms is required for decomposition activity under these conditions.
