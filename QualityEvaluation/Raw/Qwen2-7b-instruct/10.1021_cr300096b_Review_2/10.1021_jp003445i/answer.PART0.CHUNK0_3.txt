[1] "Adsorption and reaction of acetylene on a hexagonally reconstructed (5 × 20)-Pt(100) surface and two ordered Sn/Pt(100) alloy surfaces were investigated using temperature programmed desorption spectrometry (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)."
[2] "We have previously studied C2H2 adsorption and reaction on two ordered, PtSn surface alloys formed on Pt(111)."
[3] "We report herein on C2D2 adsorption on a hexagonally reconstructed (5 × 20)-Pt(100) surface, referred to as the hex phase."
[4] "The c(2 × 2) and (3×3)R30 Sn/Pt(111) surface alloys have (2 × 2) and (3×3)R30 unit cells, with θSn = 0.25 and 0.33 ML in the outermost layer, respectively."
[5] "Both of these alloys have higher surface Sn concentrations than the two surface alloys on Pt(111) that were previously studied."
[6] "The c(2 × 2) Sn/Pt(100) alloy, each Pt atom has only Sn atom nearest neighbors, forming a checker-board pattern of isolated Pt atoms surrounded by Sn atoms."
[7] "Acetylene (C2H2) chemisorption and reaction on Pt and other transition-metal surfaces has been studied many times, mainly to probe surface reactions related to heterogeneous catalysis."
[8] "The c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer on Pt(100) and c(2 × 2)Sn/Pt(100) alloy (bottom)."
[9] "We believe that this is an accurate measure of the reactivity of this surface, but it is difficult to exclude the possibility that defect sites lead to this small amount of C2D2 decomposition."
[10] "Acetylene adsorbs molecularly on Pt(111) below 330 K in a μ3η2 configuration, disproportionates to form ethylidyne (CCH3) and other species (possibly C2H) between 330 and 400 K, and then undergoes further dehydrogenation to form surface carbon and H2(g)."
[11] "C(1s) spectra for monolayer coverages of acetylene on hex-Pt(100) and the two Sn/Pt alloy surfaces at 100 K are directly compared in Figure 11."
[12] "We note that these values for acetylene adsorption on (111) and (100) Pt surfaces agree well with the sp2.5 adsorption energy of 54 kcal/mol predicted from sp3(61 kcal/mol) and sp2 (46 kcal/mol) C2 species as estimated using the QVB theory by Koel and Carter."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates involves using techniques such as temperature programmed desorption spectrometry (TPD), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These methods are crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process allows researchers to investigate how the presence of Ni modifies the Pt surface, potentially creating new active sites for catalytic reactions.
