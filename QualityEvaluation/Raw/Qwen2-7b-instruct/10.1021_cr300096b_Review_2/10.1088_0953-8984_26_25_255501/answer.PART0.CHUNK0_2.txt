<p type="paragraph">We report on the simultaneous realization of p-type conductivity and strong ferromagnetism in heavily Co-doped ZnO thin films in the presence of a high concentration of hydrogen impurities.</p>
<p type="paragraph">Through ab initio calculations, we find that the microscopic origin of hole carrier generations and ferromagnetic ordering is due to the partially occupied band of the percolative structures wherein the carrier-induced magnetic interactions can stabilize the strong spin-parallel state.</p>
