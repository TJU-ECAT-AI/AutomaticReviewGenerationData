[1] "We report on the simultaneous realization of p-type conductivity and strong ferromagnetism in heavily Co-doped ZnO thin films in the presence of a high concentration of hydrogen impurities."
[2] "Through ab initio calculations, we find that the microscopic origin of hole carrier generations and ferromagnetic ordering is due to the partially occupied band of the percolative structures wherein the carrier-induced magnetic interactions can stabilize the strong spin-parallel state."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the surface composition and structure. This control is essential for predicting and optimizing the performance of catalysts and other materials based on their surface properties.
