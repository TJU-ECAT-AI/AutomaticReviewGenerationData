The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves synthesizing these surfaces by depositing a nickel monolayer onto a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for conducting structural modeling, performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a thorough understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces within the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
