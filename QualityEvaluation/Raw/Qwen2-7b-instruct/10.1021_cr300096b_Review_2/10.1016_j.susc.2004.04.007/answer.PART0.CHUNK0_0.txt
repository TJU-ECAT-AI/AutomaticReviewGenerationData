<p>Standard procedures for cleaning the Pt single crystal and preparing the Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloys were used [15] ,[16] . The Pt(1 0 0) single crystal was cleaned using cycles of 500-eV Ar+-ion sputtering followed by annealing at 1000 K in 2 × 107-Torr O2. Once clean, the sample was annealed at 1200 K for 30 s to form the Pt(1 0 0)-hex-R0.7 reconstructed surface [22] ,[23] . The cleanliness of the sample was checked using AES and the surface ordering was confirmed using LEED.</p>
<p>The fraction of the STM image corresponding to the different regions (white, intermediate, and dark) can be used to interpret these structures. Our best estimate of the initial Sn coverage prior to annealing was 0.67 ML. Islands and intermediate-height regions cover 88% of the area imaged in Fig. 2 . These areas are covered by a predominately c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer corresponding to a Sn coverage of 0.44 ML. Dark channels covering 12% of the surface are tentatively described as areas not covered by Sn. Therefore, a discrepancy of 0.23-ML Sn exists. This amount of Sn could be present in a second-layer (beneath the Sn-adlayer) SnPt alloy formed by expelling the excess 2025% Pt from the hex-reconstruction.</p>
<p>For the bulk alloy surface, a c(2 × 2) structure is the thermodynamically stable surface termination. In the case discussed herein, the c(2 × 2) surface alloy is at best metastable. There are two main reasons why the c(2 × 2) surface alloy on Pt(1 0 0) is not stable: (i) the pure-Pt substrate has a smaller lattice constant than the Pt3Sn(1 0 0) alloy substrate. This results in additional compressive strain in the case of the surface alloy as a consequence of the lattice mismatch between the surface layer and the substrate; and (ii) the greater concentration gradient of Sn between the surface and the bulk more strongly drives diffusion of Sn into the bulk for the case of the surface alloy.</p>
<p>STM and AES results for the Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloys can be compared to similar studies performed on a bulk Pt3Sn(1 0 0) single-crystal sample [9] . The sample preparation procedure for those experiments involved sputtering and then annealing to successively higher temperatures to collect structural information at several temperatures. Because Sn is preferentially sputtered, the surface layer is initially depleted of Sn. Annealing the sample allows the surface layer to be replenished and eventually a surface layer with the bulk stoichiometry, i.e., a c(2 × 2) alloy layer, is reformed. During this process a variety of metastable structures, including a micro-facetted surface and a beaded-row' structure, were observed. Although there are obvious differences between surfaces of a bulk alloy and the surface alloys formed in our study, there are also interesting similarities and it is worthwhile to compare these two surfaces.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. The process includes cleaning the Pt surface with Ar+ ion sputtering, annealing to form a reconstructed surface, and checking cleanliness and ordering through AES and LEED. The characterization aims to understand the structure, which is crucial for modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Comparing these surfaces to bulk alloy samples reveals similarities despite differences, offering valuable information for catalysis research.

对于Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，涉及到在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。表征过程包括用Ar+离子溅射清洗Pt表面、退火形成重构表面，并通过AES和LEED检查清洁度和有序性。此表征旨在理解结构，这对于建模、DFT计算以及获得这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质具有重要意义。将这些表面与块体合金样品进行比较，尽管存在明显差异，但也能揭示一些相似之处，为催化研究提供宝贵信息。
