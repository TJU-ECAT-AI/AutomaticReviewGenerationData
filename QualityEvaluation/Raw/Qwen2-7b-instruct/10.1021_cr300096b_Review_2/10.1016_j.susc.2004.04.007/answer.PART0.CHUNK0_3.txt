<p>Metastable surface structures of the bimetallic Sn/Pt(1 0 0) system Abstract An ordered Sn overlayer on Pt(1 0 0) and several metastable Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These surfaces were studied previously using alkali-ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS), LEED, and CO chemisorption, in order to determine conditions for alloy formation [Surf. Sci. 330 (1995) 193]. In those earlier studies, structural transitions with increasing annealing temperatures from a c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer to a c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloy and finally to a (32×2)R45 alloy structure were observed.</p>
<p>STM is used to determine surface morphologies and atomic scale structures of these alloys. Sn (0.67 ML) deposited on the reconstructed Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface and annealed to 550 K formed a c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer with compact, monolayer-high islands with step edges oriented along the [1 0 0] and [0 1 0] azimuths. Annealing the sample to 750 K initiated alloying and a c(2 × 2) surface alloy formed locally. However, the c(2 × 2) alloy structure does not appear to be stable even at this early stage of alloying and narrow channels along the 1 0 0 crystallographic directions form.</p>
<p>For higher annealing temperatures, these channels evolve to form a two-domain structure with almost equidistant channels along the [1 0 0] and [0 1 0] directions, respectively. A dominant channel separation of 32 times the surface-lattice constant of Pt(1 0 0) is observed. This channel separation gives rise to a streaky (32×2)R45 LEED pattern. The channels are characterized by three missing atomic rows. Between these channels are narrow terraces that are predominantly three-atomic-rows wide. The step edges of these terraces are Pt-terminated, while Sn is alloyed in the center of these terraces. A local p(2 × 2) ordering of alloyed Sn is often observed for wider terraces. Annealing to 1000 K results in fragmentation of the narrow terraces to form small, often square, islands with side-lengths as small as 2 times the surface-lattice constant of Pt(1 0 0).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) are employed to analyze surface morphologies and atomic-scale structures. Prior studies utilized alkali-ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS), LEED, and CO chemisorption to determine conditions for alloy formation. These techniques enable the observation of structural transitions with increasing annealing temperatures, such as the formation of a c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer, a c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloy, and a (32×2)R45 alloy structure. The use of STM allows for detailed examination of the surface morphology and atomic-scale structure of these alloys, providing insights into their behavior under various conditions.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征方法是将Ni单层沉积在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上。这一过程对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及高级表面科学和催化研究中理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和俄歇电子能谱（AES）被用于分析表面形态和原子尺度结构。先前的研究利用了角分辨低能离子散射光谱（ALISS）、LEED和CO化学吸附来确定合金形成的条件。这些技术能够观察到随退火温度增加而发生的结构转变，如形成c(2 × 2)-Sn覆盖层、c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(1 0 0)表面合金和(32×2)R45合金结构。使用STM可以对表面形态和原子尺度结构进行详细检查，提供在不同条件下这些合金行为的见解。
