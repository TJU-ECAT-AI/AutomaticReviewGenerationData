<p>The clean Pt(1 0 0) surface reconstructs to form a hexagonal overlayer.</p>
<p>After Sn-deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing of the sample to 550 K, a c(2 × 2) ordered Sn overlayer is formed. The LEED pattern shows that the Pt-hex reconstruction has been lifted. Diffuse c(2 × 2) spots suggest relatively small domains.</p>
<p>For the Sn/Pt(1 0 0)-c(2 × 2) surface alloy, a sharp c(2 × 2) LEED pattern was observed for this surface.</p>
<p>A third, ordered alloy structure was prepared by depositing 1.1-ML Sn on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface and then annealing to 900 K. After this procedure, LEED showed a (32×2)R45 pattern.</p>
<p>For the Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloy annealed to 1000 K, only a (1 × 1) pattern is observed in LEED.</p>
<p>To facilitate this discussion, these results are displayed in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>Another open question that could not be unambiguously resolved by the STM studies alone was the issue of the termination of the narrow terraces of the 32 alloy.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The characterization includes studying the surface structures using techniques such as low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and angle-resolved low-energy alkali-ion scattering (ALISS). These methods provide insights into the surface morphology, atomic structure, and composition of the bimetallic surfaces. The characterization is essential for correlating the surface structure and composition with the chemical and catalytic properties of the materials.

The characterization process allows researchers to understand how the surface structure evolves with the deposition of Ni on Pt(111) surfaces at different temperatures. The formation of various surface structures, such as a c(2 × 2)-ordered Ni overlayer, a c(2 × 2) Ni/Pt surface alloy, a (32×2)R45 surface alloy, and a (1 × 1) surface after high-temperature annealing, can be studied. The LEED patterns, STM images, and ALISS results provide detailed information on the surface reconstruction, ordering, and alloying processes. These insights are crucial for developing a comprehensive understanding of the surface properties and their implications in catalytic reactions.

By comparing the structural evolution of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces with other bimetallic systems, researchers can identify common trends and differences. This comparative analysis helps in predicting the behavior of new bimetallic surfaces and designing materials with optimized properties for specific applications. The characterization process is thus fundamental in advancing the field of surface science and catalysis by providing a basis for rational material design and optimization.
