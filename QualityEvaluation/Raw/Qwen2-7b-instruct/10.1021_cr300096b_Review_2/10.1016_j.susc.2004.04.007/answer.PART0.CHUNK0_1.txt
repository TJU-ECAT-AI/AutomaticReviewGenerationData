[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using a combination of techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and angle-resolved low-energy alkali-ion scattering (ALISS)."
[2] "This process is crucial for structural modeling because it provides detailed information about the atomic arrangement and bonding in the bimetallic system. Understanding these structures is essential for predicting the electronic and chemical properties of the surfaces."
[3] "For DFT calculations, the structural characterization helps in setting up accurate models of the surfaces. The precise atomic configurations and bonding information are necessary inputs for density functional theory simulations, which predict the behavior of electrons and the reactivity of the surfaces under various conditions."
[4] "Comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces is achieved through the integration of experimental data with theoretical predictions. Structural insights from STM, LEED, AES, and ALISS complement the theoretical analysis provided by DFT calculations, leading to a holistic view of the surface chemistry and catalytic activity."
