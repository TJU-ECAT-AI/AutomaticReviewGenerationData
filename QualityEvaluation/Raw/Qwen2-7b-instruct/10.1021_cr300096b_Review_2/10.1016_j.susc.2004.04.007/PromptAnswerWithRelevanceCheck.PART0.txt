<p>Standard procedures for cleaning the Pt single crystal and preparing the Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloys were used [15] ,[16] . The Pt(1 0 0) single crystal was cleaned using cycles of 500-eV Ar+-ion sputtering followed by annealing at 1000 K in 2 × 107-Torr O2. Once clean, the sample was annealed at 1200 K for 30 s to form the Pt(1 0 0)-hex-R0.7 reconstructed surface [22] ,[23] . The cleanliness of the sample was checked using AES and the surface ordering was confirmed using LEED.</p>
<p>The fraction of the STM image corresponding to the different regions (white, intermediate, and dark) can be used to interpret these structures. Our best estimate of the initial Sn coverage prior to annealing was 0.67 ML. Islands and intermediate-height regions cover 88% of the area imaged in Fig. 2 . These areas are covered by a predominately c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer corresponding to a Sn coverage of 0.44 ML. Dark channels covering 12% of the surface are tentatively described as areas not covered by Sn. Therefore, a discrepancy of 0.23-ML Sn exists. This amount of Sn could be present in a second-layer (beneath the Sn-adlayer) SnPt alloy formed by expelling the excess 2025% Pt from the hex-reconstruction.</p>
<p>For the bulk alloy surface, a c(2 × 2) structure is the thermodynamically stable surface termination. In the case discussed herein, the c(2 × 2) surface alloy is at best metastable. There are two main reasons why the c(2 × 2) surface alloy on Pt(1 0 0) is not stable: (i) the pure-Pt substrate has a smaller lattice constant than the Pt3Sn(1 0 0) alloy substrate. This results in additional compressive strain in the case of the surface alloy as a consequence of the lattice mismatch between the surface layer and the substrate; and (ii) the greater concentration gradient of Sn between the surface and the bulk more strongly drives diffusion of Sn into the bulk for the case of the surface alloy.</p>
<p>STM and AES results for the Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloys can be compared to similar studies performed on a bulk Pt3Sn(1 0 0) single-crystal sample [9] . The sample preparation procedure for those experiments involved sputtering and then annealing to successively higher temperatures to collect structural information at several temperatures. Because Sn is preferentially sputtered, the surface layer is initially depleted of Sn. Annealing the sample allows the surface layer to be replenished and eventually a surface layer with the bulk stoichiometry, i.e., a c(2 × 2) alloy layer, is reformed. During this process a variety of metastable structures, including a micro-facetted surface and a beaded-row' structure, were observed. Although there are obvious differences between surfaces of a bulk alloy and the surface alloys formed in our study, there are also interesting similarities and it is worthwhile to compare these two surfaces.</p>

<p>Metastable surface structures of the bimetallic Sn/Pt(1 0 0) system Abstract An ordered Sn overlayer on Pt(1 0 0) and several metastable Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloys were studied using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). These surfaces were studied previously using alkali-ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS), LEED, and CO chemisorption, in order to determine conditions for alloy formation [Surf. Sci. 330 (1995) 193]. In those earlier studies, structural transitions with increasing annealing temperatures from a c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer to a c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloy and finally to a (32×2)R45 alloy structure were observed.</p>
<p>STM is used to determine surface morphologies and atomic scale structures of these alloys. Sn (0.67 ML) deposited on the reconstructed Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface and annealed to 550 K formed a c(2 × 2)-Sn overlayer with compact, monolayer-high islands with step edges oriented along the [1 0 0] and [0 1 0] azimuths. Annealing the sample to 750 K initiated alloying and a c(2 × 2) surface alloy formed locally. However, the c(2 × 2) alloy structure does not appear to be stable even at this early stage of alloying and narrow channels along the 1 0 0 crystallographic directions form.</p>
<p>For higher annealing temperatures, these channels evolve to form a two-domain structure with almost equidistant channels along the [1 0 0] and [0 1 0] directions, respectively. A dominant channel separation of 32 times the surface-lattice constant of Pt(1 0 0) is observed. This channel separation gives rise to a streaky (32×2)R45 LEED pattern. The channels are characterized by three missing atomic rows. Between these channels are narrow terraces that are predominantly three-atomic-rows wide. The step edges of these terraces are Pt-terminated, while Sn is alloyed in the center of these terraces. A local p(2 × 2) ordering of alloyed Sn is often observed for wider terraces. Annealing to 1000 K results in fragmentation of the narrow terraces to form small, often square, islands with side-lengths as small as 2 times the surface-lattice constant of Pt(1 0 0).</p>

<p>The clean Pt(1 0 0) surface reconstructs to form a hexagonal overlayer.</p>
<p>After Sn-deposition at room temperature and subsequent annealing of the sample to 550 K, a c(2 × 2) ordered Sn overlayer is formed. The LEED pattern shows that the Pt-hex reconstruction has been lifted. Diffuse c(2 × 2) spots suggest relatively small domains.</p>
<p>For the Sn/Pt(1 0 0)-c(2 × 2) surface alloy, a sharp c(2 × 2) LEED pattern was observed for this surface.</p>
<p>A third, ordered alloy structure was prepared by depositing 1.1-ML Sn on the Pt(1 0 0)-hex surface and then annealing to 900 K. After this procedure, LEED showed a (32×2)R45 pattern.</p>
<p>For the Sn/Pt(1 0 0) surface alloy annealed to 1000 K, only a (1 × 1) pattern is observed in LEED.</p>
<p>To facilitate this discussion, these results are displayed in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>Another open question that could not be unambiguously resolved by the STM studies alone was the issue of the termination of the narrow terraces of the 32 alloy.</p>
