The preparation of the Pt(1 1 1) crystal involved using 1-keV Ar+-ion sputtering followed by oxygen treatment at 5 × 107 Torr for 2 minutes at 900 K. This process resulted in a clean surface as confirmed by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a distinct (1 × 1) pattern in low energy electron diffraction (LEED).

将Pt(1 1 1)晶体制备过程包括使用1 keV的Ar+离子溅射，随后在900 K的条件下进行氧气处理2分钟至5×10^7托。这一过程产生了干净的表面，这通过阿格尔电子光谱（AES）和低能电子衍射（LEED）中的（1×1）模式得到验证。
