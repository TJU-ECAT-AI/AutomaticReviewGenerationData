[1] "The maximum oxygen coverage obtained by heating the N2O4 monolayer was about θO=0.4 ML."
[2] "After heating to 900 K leaves θO = 0.2 ML at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species, corresponding to an ordered surface film of Sn1.5O species exhibiting a (4 × 4) LEED pattern."
[3] "This made it necessary to regenerate the 3 alloy after each NO2 experiment by additional Sn dosing and annealing."
[4] "Our determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to this structure is consistent with either proposal."

1. The maximum oxygen coverage reached by heating the N2O4 monolayer was 0.4 ML.
2. Heating the surface to 900 K left an oxygen coverage of 0.2 ML associated with oxidized Sn species, forming a film of Sn1.5O with a (4 × 4) LEED pattern.
3. To maintain the surface free of coadsorbed NO and provide energy for NO2 dissociation, the 3 alloy had to be regenerated after each NO2 experiment with additional Sn dosing and annealing.
4. Our findings that the structure corresponds to Sn1.5O species aligns with previous proposals on the structure of the oxidized surface layer.

1. 加热后，最大氧覆盖度达到0.4 ML。
2. 将表面加热至900 K后，留下了与氧化Sn物种相关的0.2 ML氧覆盖度，形成了具有(4 × 4) LEED图案的Sn1.5O薄膜。
3. 为了保持表面免受共吸附NO的影响并提供NO2分解所需的能量，每次进行NO2实验后都需要通过额外的Sn沉积和退火来再生3合金。
4. 我们的研究结果表明，该结构对应于Sn1.5O物种，这与关于氧化表面层结构的先前提议相一致。
