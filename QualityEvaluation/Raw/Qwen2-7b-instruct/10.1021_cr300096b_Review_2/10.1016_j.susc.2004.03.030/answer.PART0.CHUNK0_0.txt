[1] "Experiments were performed in a three-level UHV chamber as described earlier [33]."
[2] "The Pt(1 1 1) crystal (Atomergic; 10 mm diameter, 1.5 mm thick) was prepared by 1-keV Ar+-ion sputtering and oxygen treatment (5 × 107 Torr O2, 900 K, 2 min) to give a clean spectrum using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and a sharp (1 × 1) pattern in low energy electron diffraction (LEED)."
[3] "The NO2 line was pumped out and refilled after every dose to minimize NO2 decomposition."
[4] "After heating to 900 K, which desorbs some oxygen from the surface, some small loss features due to SnO modes still remain, but these are eliminated by heating to 1100 K."
[5] "We find that after desorption of all surface-bound NO and oxygen associated with Pt sites, θO=0.2 ML remains at the surface associated with oxidized Sn species."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The UHV chamber used for experiments was prepared with a Pt(1 1 1) crystal of 10 mm diameter and 1.5 mm thickness. This crystal was treated with 1-keV Ar+-ion sputtering and oxygen at 5 × 10^7 Torr, 900 K, and 2 minutes to ensure a clean surface.
3. To minimize NO2 decomposition, the NO2 line was pumped out and refilled after every dose during experiments.
4. Heating the surface to 900 K removes some oxygen from the surface, leaving behind small loss features due to SnO modes that are eliminated by heating to 1100 K.
5. After desorption of all surface-bound NO and oxygen associated with Pt sites, 0.2 ML of oxygen remains at the surface, which is associated with oxidized Sn species.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及高级表面科学和催化研究中理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。
2. 实验中使用的UHV室中的Pt(1 1 1)晶体通过1 keV Ar+离子溅射和在5×10^7托，900 K和2分钟时的氧气处理准备。确保了表面清洁。
3. 为了最小化NO2分解，在每次剂量期间将NO2线泵出并重新填充。
4. 将表面加热至900 K可从表面去除一些氧，留下由SnO模式引起的微小损耗特征，这些特征通过加热至1100 K消除。
5. 在脱除所有表面绑定的NO和与Pt位点相关的氧之后，表面残留0.2 ML的氧，该氧与氧化Sn物种相关联。
