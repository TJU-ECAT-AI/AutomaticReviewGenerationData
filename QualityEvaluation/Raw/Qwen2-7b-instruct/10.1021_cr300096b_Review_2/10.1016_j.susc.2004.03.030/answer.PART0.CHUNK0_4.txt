[4] "The surface dipole selection rule requires an adsorption geometry that has the molecular plane tilted with respect to the surface normal for observation of the asymmetric (νas,NO2) stretching mode of N2O4 at 1795 cm1, and we propose a monodentate O-bonded species."

[6] "O2 desorption from Sn sites occurs at higher temperatures than from Pt sites."
[7] "Our determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to this structure is consistent with either proposal."
[8] "Our results following NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K is also consistent with previous structural models developed for more heavily oxidized alloys [43]."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The surface dipole selection rule necessitates a specific adsorption geometry for the observation of the asymmetric stretching mode of N2O4. The proposed species is monodentate, bonding through a single oxygen atom to the surface.
3. NO2 decomposition on the 3 alloy occurs between 220 and 300 K, releasing surface oxygen and coadsorbed NO.
4. Oxygen desorption from Sn sites happens at higher temperatures compared to Pt sites.
5. The determination that Sn1.5O species correspond to the (4 × 4) structure aligns with the proposals made by previous studies.
6. The findings from NO2 exposures on the alloy at 600 K are consistent with the structural models developed for more heavily oxidized alloys.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层进行。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及深入理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质，在高级表面科学和催化研究领域至关重要。
2. 表面偶极选择规则要求特定的吸附几何结构，以便观察N2O4的不对称伸缩模式位于1795 cm1。提出的物种是一种单点结合的氧原子，与表面结合。
3. NO2在3合金上的分解发生在220至300 K之间，释放出表面氧气和共吸附的NO。
4. 氧气从Sn位点的脱附发生在比Pt位点更高的温度。
5. 确定Sn1.5O物种对应于（4 × 4）结构与先前研究提出的提案一致。
6. 对于在600 K下进行NO2暴露的结果与更高度氧化合金的结构模型一致。
