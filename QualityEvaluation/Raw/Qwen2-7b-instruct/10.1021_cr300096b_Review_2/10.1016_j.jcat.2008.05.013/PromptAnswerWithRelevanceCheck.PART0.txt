The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal substrate. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. AES and TPD experiments are conducted within a UHV chamber equipped with specialized instruments for surface characterization and in-situ verification of the dosed gases' purity. AES is used to quantify the deposition of metals and monitor their thermal behavior. The deposition process at 300 K forms a surface configuration that represents 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111). The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces prepared at 600 K have a stoichiometry of Cu50Pt50 and are confined to the first two atomic layers. DFT calculations predict that the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures have weaker hydrogen binding energies compared to the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces and parent metals. A volcano-type relationship exists between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) showing the highest activity.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves multiple steps crucial for understanding the structural and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of catalysis research. The process begins with the deposition of a nickel monolayer onto a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This deposition step is essential for structuring the bimetallic interface and influencing the electronic properties of the resulting surface. Following deposition, the surfaces undergo heat treatment at an elevated temperature of 600 K, leading to diffusion of the nickel atoms into the subsurface region. However, the composition of the resulting layers is not precisely the ideal Pt-3d-Ni structure, indicating the complexity of the bimetallic interface. This process allows for the formation of heterometallic bonds, which alter the electronic properties of the surface, often referred to as the ligand effect. 

A key parameter used to describe these changes in electronic properties is the position of the surface d-band center relative to the Fermi level. This parameter provides insights into how the bimetallic surfaces interact with small adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen, alkenes, and oxygenates. Additionally, it correlates with the activation barriers for reactions involving these molecules, enabling predictions of surfaces with desirable catalytic properties for specific reactions.

The interaction of cyclohexene with Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is extensively characterized. DFT calculations predict that cyclohexene binds strongly to Pt(111) and Ni(111), but more weakly to Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surfaces. This conclusion aligns with the experimental findings from Hwu et al., supporting the understanding of the bonding dynamics between cyclohexene and the surface components. 

Understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces is crucial for predicting their reactivity. Density functional theory (DFT) can be utilized to forecast the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces based on their binding energies, especially for catalytic reactions like hydrogenation. The volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy highlights the importance of selecting bimetallic surfaces with optimal properties for specific applications. This approach offers a systematic method for identifying bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic characteristics for hydrogenation reactions.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves a detailed examination of the deposition process, heat treatment, electronic properties, and catalytic reactivity, providing a comprehensive framework for advancing the field of surface science and catalysis research.
