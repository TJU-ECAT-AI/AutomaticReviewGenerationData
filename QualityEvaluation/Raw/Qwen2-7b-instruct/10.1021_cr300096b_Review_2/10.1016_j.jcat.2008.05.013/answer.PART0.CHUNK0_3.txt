Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. AES is utilized for surface characterization, and TPD experiments ensure the purity of the dosed gases. The surfaces are heated to high temperatures after deposition, and AES scans are conducted post-cooling to assess changes in surface composition. The 3d-Pt-Pt(111) configuration represents 1 ML of 3d metal on Pt(111), prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K. DFT calculations predict shifts in the surface d-band center based on the presence of surface or subsurface 3d metals. The subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures demonstrate lower hydrogen binding energies compared to the corresponding parent metals, as confirmed by TPD experiments. The quantification of hydrogenation activity relies on TPD peak area ratios, considering the net reactions occurring on the surfaces.
