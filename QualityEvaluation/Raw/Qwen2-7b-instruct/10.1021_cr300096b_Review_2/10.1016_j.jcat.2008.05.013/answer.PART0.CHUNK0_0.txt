[1] "In many cases, these unique properties result in activities and/or selectivities that exceed those achievable with a monometallic catalyst."
[2] "This was done by modifying Pt(111) with several 3d transition metals, including Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu."
[3] "The hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) sandwich structures was significantly lower than that on the corresponding 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface structures and monometallic parent metal surfaces."
[4] "Deposition at the elevated temperature of 600 K leads to the diffusion of 3d metals into the subsurface region, but the composition of each layer is not exactly the ideal Pt-3d-Pt(111) structure."
[5] "In addition, the formation of heterometallic bonds further alters the electronic properties of the surface, which is often referred to as the ligand effect."
[6] "This parameter has been shown to strongly correlate with the ability of bimetallic surfaces to bind with small adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen."
[7] "These results support the conclusions of Hwu et al. that cyclohexene is strongly bonded to Pt(111) and Ni(111) and more weakly bonded to Pt-Ni-Pt(111)."
[8] "The absence of the hydrogenation pathway on these surfaces is most likely due to the strong bonding of hydrogen and cyclohexene, as predicted by DFT in Fig. 4 and Table 1 , respectively."
[9] "The activities in Table 2 are quantified by TPD peak area ratios in conjunction with the following net reactions occurring on these surfaces:"

To characterize Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, researchers typically use a combination of techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for detailed analysis of the composition, structure, and bonding characteristics of the surface. The information gathered helps in predicting the catalytic activity and selectivity of the bimetallic catalysts, which can significantly influence the efficiency of chemical reactions.

为了表征通过在单晶Pt（111）或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面，研究者通常使用一系列技术，包括X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、阿格电子能谱（AES）和透射电子显微镜（TEM）。这个过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及我们对先进表面科学和催化研究背景下这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质全面理解至关重要。因为它允许对表面的组成、结构和键合特性进行详细的分析。收集到的信息有助于预测双金属催化剂的催化活性和选择性，这可以显著影响化学反应的效率。
