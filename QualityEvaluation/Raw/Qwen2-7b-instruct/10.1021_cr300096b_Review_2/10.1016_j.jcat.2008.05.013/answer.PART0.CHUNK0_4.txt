1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. AES measurements were employed to quantify the deposition and thermal behavior of metals on the surface, and TPD experiments were utilized to verify the purity of the dosed gases.
2. The AES quantification technique was used to determine the quantity of 3d metal deposited on the surface. AES peak-to-peak ratios were measured at an accelerating voltage of 3 kV to assess the deposition of metals such as Fe and Cu on Pt(111) surfaces.
3. AES was applied to quantify the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Fe on Pt(111) surfaces. The process involved depositing Fe at 300 K and subsequently heating the surface at 3 K/s to determine changes in surface composition.
4. AES was similarly utilized to quantify the physical vapor deposition and thermal behavior of Cu on Pt(111) surfaces, with Cu being deposited at 300 K and then heated to observe changes in the surface composition.
5. After deposition, the surfaces were heated at 3 K/s to high temperatures, and AES scans were performed post-cooling to the surface to below 500 K, enabling the determination of changes in the surface composition.
6. Binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells consisting of four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax. This method facilitated the investigation of the interactions between the adsorbates and the metal surfaces.
7. Hydrogen desorption peak temperatures were correlated with the d-band center of the surfaces, providing insights into the electronic properties and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces.
8. The hydrogenation activity of surfaces was quantified using TPD peak area ratios, taking into account the net reactions occurring on these surfaces.
9. The activity toward the decomposition pathway could not be quantified solely using hydrogen peak areas, as the hydrogen evolved from the surface originated from both dehydrogenation reactions and pre-adsorbed hydrogen.
10. The data points in Figure 10 included binding energy and hydrogenation activity data from a monolayer of Pt on a W(110) substrate, which served as a reference for comparative analysis.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层进行的。这一过程对于结构建模和第一原理计算至关重要，因为它使研究者能够理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质。AES测量被用于量化金属在表面上的沉积和热行为，并利用TPD实验验证了所注入气体的纯度。
