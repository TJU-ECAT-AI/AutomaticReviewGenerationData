The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves multiple steps crucial for understanding the structural and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of catalysis research. The process begins with the deposition of a nickel monolayer onto a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This deposition step is essential for structuring the bimetallic interface and influencing the electronic properties of the resulting surface. Following deposition, the surfaces undergo heat treatment at an elevated temperature of 600 K, leading to diffusion of the nickel atoms into the subsurface region. However, the composition of the resulting layers is not precisely the ideal Pt-3d-Ni structure, indicating the complexity of the bimetallic interface. This process allows for the formation of heterometallic bonds, which alter the electronic properties of the surface, often referred to as the ligand effect. 

A key parameter used to describe these changes in electronic properties is the position of the surface d-band center relative to the Fermi level. This parameter provides insights into how the bimetallic surfaces interact with small adsorbates, such as atomic hydrogen and oxygen, alkenes, and oxygenates. Additionally, it correlates with the activation barriers for reactions involving these molecules, enabling predictions of surfaces with desirable catalytic properties for specific reactions.

The interaction of cyclohexene with Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is extensively characterized. DFT calculations predict that cyclohexene binds strongly to Pt(111) and Ni(111), but more weakly to Pt-Ni-Pt(111) surfaces. This conclusion aligns with the experimental findings from Hwu et al., supporting the understanding of the bonding dynamics between cyclohexene and the surface components. 

Understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces is crucial for predicting their reactivity. Density functional theory (DFT) can be utilized to forecast the reactivity of bimetallic surfaces based on their binding energies, especially for catalytic reactions like hydrogenation. The volcano-type relationship between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy highlights the importance of selecting bimetallic surfaces with optimal properties for specific applications. This approach offers a systematic method for identifying bimetallic surfaces with desirable catalytic characteristics for hydrogenation reactions.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves a detailed examination of the deposition process, heat treatment, electronic properties, and catalytic reactivity, providing a comprehensive framework for advancing the field of surface science and catalysis research.
