[1] "To study the modification effects on surface chemistry due to bimetallic formation, a monolayer film of one metal can be deposited onto a single-crystal substrate of another metal."
[2] "The current study was performed in a two-level stainless steel ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure of . This chamber was equipped with an Auger electron spectrometer (AES) with a single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for surface characterization and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) for temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and in-situ verification of the purity of the dosed gases."
[3] "Fig. 1 displays the change in the Pt and Fe AES intensities, along with the ratio of the Fe to Pt intensities, as a function of time at an approximately constant deposition rate."
[4] "In summary, 3d-Pt-Pt(111), or the surface configuration, is representative of 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111) and was prepared by depositing 1 ML at 300 K."
[5] "The current study was extended to the growth and thermal behavior of Fe and Cu on the Pt(111) surface. The quantity of 3d metal deposited was determined by the 3d (LMM)/Pt (241 eV) AES peak-to-peak ratio, noting that an accelerating voltage of 3 kV was used in all AES measurements."
[6] "The binding energies of atomic hydrogen and cyclohexene were studied using super cells containing four atomic layers, with the top two layers allowed to relax in each case."
[7] "The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces prepared at 600 K in the current study should have a Cu50Pt50 stoichiometry and be confined to the first two atomic layers."
[8] "Based on literature results and as confirmed by AES measurements, the Cu/Pt(111) surfaces prepared at 600 K in the current study should have a Cu50Pt50 stoichiometry and be confined to the first two atomic layers."
[9] "The DFT calculations predict that the Pt-3d-Pt(111) subsurface structures should have weaker HBE than both the corresponding 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surface structures and the parent metals."
[10] "Furthermore, a volcano-type relationship was found between the hydrogenation activity and binding energy of cyclohexene, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) exhibiting the greatest activity."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal substrate. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. AES and TPD experiments are conducted within a UHV chamber equipped with specialized instruments for surface characterization and in-situ verification of the dosed gases' purity. AES is used to quantify the deposition of metals and monitor their thermal behavior. The deposition process at 300 K forms a surface configuration that represents 1 ML of the 3d metal on Pt(111). The Cu/Pt(111) surfaces prepared at 600 K have a stoichiometry of Cu50Pt50 and are confined to the first two atomic layers. DFT calculations predict that the subsurface Pt-3d-Pt(111) structures have weaker hydrogen binding energies compared to the 3d-Pt-Pt(111) surfaces and parent metals. A volcano-type relationship exists between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy, with Pt-Ni-Pt(111) showing the highest activity.
