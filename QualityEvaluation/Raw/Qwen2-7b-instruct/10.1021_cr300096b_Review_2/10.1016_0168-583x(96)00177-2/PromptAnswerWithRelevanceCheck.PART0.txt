The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The study focuses on the growth and structure of thin Pt films on Cu(111), which is part of the research project on thin films and surface alloys for surface analysis. Low energy Li+ ion scattering is utilized to examine the composition and structure of the films deposited at room temperature and after annealing. The results demonstrate that the surface composition depends strongly on annealing temperature, and the formation of a metastable surface alloy is observed at around 300°C. The surface alloy is found to consist of at least three layers of Cu,Pt.

By analyzing the changes in Pt and Cu signals with annealing temperature, researchers can understand the composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. Moreover, measuring the Pt and Cu signals at grazing incidence helps in determining the stacking and orientation of the thin Pt films on Cu(111). The observed changes in composition with temperature suggest that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy is Cu,Pt, which is supported by the existence of bulk phases with similar compositions. Despite being a relatively stable surface alloy, the fee structure is observed even in very dilute Pt concentrations, highlighting its significance in bimetallic systems.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is conducted through several methods. These include angle-resolved low-energy ion scattering, which allows for the examination of the surface layers of the thin film and the alloy. This process is crucial because it enables researchers to understand the structural and electronic properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which are essential in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The layer-by-layer growth mechanism up to at least three monolayers is observed, and the precise composition and structure of the Pt/Cu(111) surface have not been fully identified. The study uses techniques such as low-energy ion scattering to determine the symmetry, orientation, and stacking of the film, which helps in comprehending the structural details of the bimetallic surfaces. Additionally, the extent of surface buckling is directly determined from the ion scattering data, providing insights into the physical properties of these surfaces.
