[1] "The growth and structure of thin Pt films on Cu(111) have been studied by low energy Li+ ion scattering."
[2] "The system tends to form the energetically most favourable configuration,while kinetics determines the growth behaviour of the film."
[3] "By analyzing the shadowing features in the a scans,it allows us to determine the symmetry,the orientation and the stacking of the film."
[4] "The observed composition change with temperature strongly suggests that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy is Cu,Pt:bulk phases of composition Cu,Pt, CuPt and CuPt,are known to exist."
[5] "It is interesting to note that the fee structure exists in the bulk down to very dilute Pt concentrations,although it is a relatively stable surface alloy for the Cu,Pt case."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By employing low energy Li+ ion scattering, researchers can analyze the surface composition, structure, and stability. The results suggest that the surface alloy consists of at least three layers of Cu and Pt, with the stoichiometry changing with annealing temperature. The fee structure is observed even at dilute Pt concentrations, indicating its stability as a surface alloy in the Cu/Pt case. However, no evidence of surface chemical ordering was observed throughout the experiment.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及深入理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。通过使用低能Li+离子散射，研究人员可以分析表面组成、结构和稳定性。结果表明，表面合金由至少三层Cu和Pt构成，其组成随退火温度变化。费氏结构在稀释的Pt浓度下仍可观察到，表明在Cu/Pt情况下它作为表面合金的稳定性。然而，在整个实验过程中没有发现表面化学排序的证据。
