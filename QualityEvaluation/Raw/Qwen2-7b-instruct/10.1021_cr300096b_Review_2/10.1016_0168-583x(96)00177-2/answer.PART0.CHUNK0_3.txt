The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is conducted through several methods. These include angle-resolved low-energy ion scattering, which allows for the examination of the surface layers of the thin film and the alloy. This process is crucial because it enables researchers to understand the structural and electronic properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which are essential in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The layer-by-layer growth mechanism up to at least three monolayers is observed, and the precise composition and structure of the Pt/Cu(111) surface have not been fully identified. The study uses techniques such as low-energy ion scattering to determine the symmetry, orientation, and stacking of the film, which helps in comprehending the structural details of the bimetallic surfaces. Additionally, the extent of surface buckling is directly determined from the ion scattering data, providing insights into the physical properties of these surfaces.
