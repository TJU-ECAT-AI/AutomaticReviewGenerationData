[1] "The growth of thin films on metal substrates is a rapidly expanding field due to the fundamental importance of these systems in both heterogeneous catalysis and surface science."
[2] "We have chosen the Pt/Cu(ll 1) system as part of our research project on thin films and surface alloys for surface analysis."
[3] "Low-energy ion scattering is especially well suited for this study since it has extreme sensitivity to the surface layers of the thin film and the alloy."
[4] "The results indicate that the Pt and Cu signals show a strong dependence on the annealing temperature."
[5] "The structure of thin Pt films up to 3.2 ML has been measured by monitoring the Pt and Cu signals obtained at grazing incidence."
[6] "The observed composition change with temperature strongly suggests that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy is Cu,Pt:bulk phases of composition Cu,Pt, CuPt and CuPt,are known to exist."
[7] "It is interesting to note that the fee structure exists in the bulk down to very dilute Pt concentrations,although it is a relatively stable surface alloy for the Cu,Pt case."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for detailed examination of the surface layers. Low-energy ion scattering techniques are particularly suited for studying these surfaces due to their sensitivity to the surface layers. By analyzing the changes in Pt and Cu signals with annealing temperature, researchers can understand the composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. Moreover, measuring the Pt and Cu signals at grazing incidence helps in determining the stacking and orientation of the thin Pt films on Cu(111). The observed changes in composition with temperature suggest that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy is Cu,Pt, which is supported by the existence of bulk phases with similar compositions. Despite being a relatively stable surface alloy, the fee structure is observed even in very dilute Pt concentrations, highlighting its significance in bimetallic systems.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它允许对表面层进行详细检查。低能离子散射技术特别适合研究这些表面，因为它们对表面层具有高度敏感性。通过分析随退火温度变化的Pt和Cu信号，研究人员可以了解双金属表面的组成和结构。此外，在掠入射下测量Pt和Cu信号有助于确定在Cu(111)上的薄Pt薄膜的堆叠和方向。通过分析温度变化对信号的影响，可以理解双金属表面的组成和结构。观察到的温度依赖性表明表面合金的组成是Cu,Pt，这与已知的具有相似组成的固体相相一致。尽管在非常稀释的Pt浓度下仍能观察到体结构，但其作为表面合金的稳定性表明它在双金属系统中的重要性。
