[1] "The growth and structure of thin Pt films on Cu(111) have been studied by low energy Li+ ion scattering."
[2] "The results indicate that the Pt and Cu signals show a strong dependence on the annealing temperature."
[3] "The fact that the Pt and Cu 4 scans are nearly identical in shape compared to the scans from Cu,Pt(l 11) confirms the formation of a Cu,Pt surface alloy."
[4] "The observed Pt and Cu shadowing peaks at higher incident angles strongly suggest that there are at least three layers of Cu,Pt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The study focuses on the growth and structure of thin Pt films on Cu(111), which is part of the research project on thin films and surface alloys for surface analysis. Low energy Li+ ion scattering is utilized to examine the composition and structure of the films deposited at room temperature and after annealing. The results demonstrate that the surface composition depends strongly on annealing temperature, and the formation of a metastable surface alloy is observed at around 300°C. The surface alloy is found to consist of at least three layers of Cu,Pt.
