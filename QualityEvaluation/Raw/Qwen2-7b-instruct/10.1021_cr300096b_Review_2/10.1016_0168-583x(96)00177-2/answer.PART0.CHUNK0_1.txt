[1] "The growth and structure of thin Pt films on Cu(111) have been studied by low energy Li+ ion scattering."
[2] "We have chosen the Pt/Cu(ll 1) system as part of our research project on thin films and surface alloys for surface analysis."
[3] "The system tends to form the energetically most favourable configuration,while kinetics determines the growth behaviour of the film."
[4] "Film growth and the resulting morphologies will then be governed by kinetic factors."
[5] "The large positive surface energy difference between platinum and copper (yr, - ye,, > 0) should favour a 3D cluster growth for Pt on Cu(ll1)."
[6] "The strong tendency of the Pt overlayer toward an epitaxial-growth evidenced by LEED and low energy Li ion scattering reflects its relatively strong Pt-Cu interaction."
[7] "It seems that the growth of me&stable Pt overlayers on Cu(l11) may be possible under some conditions due to kinetic limitations."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it enables scientists to precisely control and analyze the interface between the two metals. By doing so, researchers can tailor the properties of the bimetallic surface to suit specific applications, such as enhancing catalytic activity or improving the stability of the material under various conditions.
