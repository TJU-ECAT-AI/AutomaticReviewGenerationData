Answer: 
The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The characterization includes techniques such as LEED, AES STM, and DFT calculations. STM studies conclude that Co grows on Pt in a quasi layer-by-layer mode at 300 K, similar to the Ni/Pt(111) system. LEED studies show a diffuse (1 × 1) pattern at 1 ML Co coverage and at a deposition temperature of 600 K. Moreover, the Co/Pt(111) surfaces exhibit chemical properties strikingly similar to those observed in the Ni/Pt(111) system, including the molecular desorption of H2 occurring in the temperature range of 150300 K.

答案：Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征过程涉及在单晶Pt或多晶Pt基片上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行全面理解至关重要。表征方法包括LEED、AES STM和DFT计算。STM研究发现，在300 K时，Co在Pt上以准层状模式生长，类似于Ni/Pt(111)系统。LEED研究表明，在1 ML Co覆盖度和600 K沉积温度下出现扩散（1×1）图案。此外，Co/Pt(111)表面的化学性质与Ni/Pt(111)系统中观察到的极为相似，包括H2的分子脱附发生在150至300 K的温度范围内。

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. AES was used to characterize the Co/Pt(111) surfaces. The Co(777 eV) and Pt(241 eV) AES peaks as a function of deposition time at 600 K were shown in Figure 1a. The Co/Pt(111) surfaces were prepared at a crystal temperature of 600 K. Deposition of the Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was carried out with crystal temperatures of 300 and 600 K, as noted in the figures. The AES and TPD measurements were reproduced at least twice on all the surfaces. The error bars in the estimation of activity and selectivity are in the range of 10% of the values reported in Table 1. Incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen.

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research. AES techniques are commonly used for such characterization. The stability of Co atoms within the bulk of Pt(111) compared to on its surface plays a role in modifying the electronic properties of the Pt surface.
