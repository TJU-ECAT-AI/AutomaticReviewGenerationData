Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research. AES techniques are commonly used for such characterization. The stability of Co atoms within the bulk of Pt(111) compared to on its surface plays a role in modifying the electronic properties of the Pt surface. The presence of subsurface Co atoms is a key factor influencing the electronic properties of the Pt surface, which subsequently affects the hydrogenation properties of the bimetallic surfaces.
