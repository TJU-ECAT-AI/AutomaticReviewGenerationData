[1] "Numerous groups have studied the physical and electronic properties of the Co/Pt(111) surface using LEED, AES STM, and DFT calculations."
[2] "AES was used to characterize the Co/Pt(111) surfaces."
[3] "In all cases, the Co(777 eV)/Pt(241 eV) ratio decreases until it reaches approximately zero at 950 K."
[4] "These results show that Co diffuses into Pt(111) at low temperatures."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise measurement and analysis of the surface composition and structure. The AES technique is particularly useful for characterizing the formation of alloy structures, the diffusion of Co into the Pt(111) surface, and the electronic properties modifications induced by the presence of Co, which are essential for understanding the catalytic activities of these surfaces.
