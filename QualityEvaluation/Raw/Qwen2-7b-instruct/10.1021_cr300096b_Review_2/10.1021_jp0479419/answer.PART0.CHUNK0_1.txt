1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. AES was used to characterize the Co/Pt(111) surfaces. The Co(777 eV) and Pt(241 eV) AES peaks as a function of deposition time at 600 K were shown in Figure 1a. The Co/Pt(111) surfaces were prepared at a crystal temperature of 600 K. Deposition of the Co/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was carried out with crystal temperatures of 300 and 600 K, as noted in the figures. The AES and TPD measurements were reproduced at least twice on all the surfaces. The error bars in the estimation of activity and selectivity are in the range of 10% of the values reported in Table 1. Incorporating subsurface Co or Ni into a Pt(111) substrate changes the electronic properties of the surface Pt d-band and the adsorption properties of hydrogen.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过在单晶Pt或聚晶Pt基板上沉积一层Ni单层进行。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对先进表面科学和催化研究背景下这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行全面理解至关重要。
2. 使用AES来表征Co/Pt(111)表面。图1a展示了在600 K下沉积时间与Co(777 eV)和Pt(241 eV)AES峰之间的关系。Co/Pt(111)表面在600 K的晶片温度下制备。双金属Co/Pt(111)表面的沉积温度为300 K和600 K，具体如图所示。AES和TPD测量在所有表面上至少重复进行了两次。活动和选择性估计的误差条在报告的表格1中值的范围是10%。将Subsurface Co或Ni引入Pt(111)基质中改变了表面Pt d带的电子特性和氢吸附特性。
