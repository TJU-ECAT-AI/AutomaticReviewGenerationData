[1] "Although catalysts have been used since the middle ages in ancient industries such as brewing, it was not until 1836 that the definition of catalysis as a substance that facilitates a reaction was introduced by Berzelius."
[2] "With very few exceptions hydrogen is found to adsorb in a hollow site on the {111} surfaces."

[5] "The lattice constant for platinum, 3.958 A , is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of 3.924 A ."
[6] "The surface energy for the pure platinum surface is 1.2 J m−21 which rises to 2.0 J m−21 for the (2 6 2) PtSn surface and 2.3 J m−21 for the (!3 6 !3R30u) PtSn case."
[7] "On the tin doped surfaces however the barrier to diffusion is much higher."
[8] "The much higher barrier to diffusion on the tin doped surfaces means that hydrogen will be a lot less mobile on these surfaces."
