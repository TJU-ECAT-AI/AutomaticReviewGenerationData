[1] "Although catalysts have been used since the middle ages in ancient industries such as brewing, it was not until 1836 that the definition of catalysis as a substance that facilitates a reaction was introduced by Berzelius."
[2] "The addition of a second metal to a surface will produce large perturbations in the electronic structure of that surface giving scope to fine tune the catalysts properties for the target reaction."
[3] "The diffusion calculations show significant differences in the mobility of hydrogen providing a possible explanation for the changes in catalytic action on tin doping of platinum."
[4] "Although every adsorption mode in Fig. 4 was considered for hydrogen on PtSn surfaces in this work, only 5 were local minima on the (2 6 2) surface and three for the (!3 6 !3R30u) system."

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations as it allows for the creation of a bimetallic interface that can be studied at the atomic level. Understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces is essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research because it provides insights into the behavior of catalysts and the mechanisms of catalytic reactions. The detailed analysis of the surfaces' structure, bonding, electronic state, and vibrational characteristics helps in predicting and optimizing the catalytic activity and selectivity of these materials in industrial applications.
