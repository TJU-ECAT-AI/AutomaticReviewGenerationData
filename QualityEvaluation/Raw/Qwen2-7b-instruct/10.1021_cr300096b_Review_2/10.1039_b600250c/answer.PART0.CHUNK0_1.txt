[1] "The addition of a second metal to a surface will produce large perturbations in the electronic structure of that surface giving scope to fine tune the catalysts properties for the target reaction."
[2] "In general H2 dissociation is easy on transition metal (TM) surfaces with the exception of Cu, Au and Ag."
[3] "The diffusion calculations show significant differences in the mobility of hydrogen providing a possible explanation for the changes in catalytic action on tin doping of platinum."
[4] "On the tin doped surfaces however the barrier to diffusion is much higher. For the (2 6 2) surface the maximum occurs at 41 kJ mol−1 and on the (!3 6 !3R30u) PtSn {111} surface diffusion is even more difficult with a maximum of 95 kJ mol−1."
[5] "This will have important implications for the kinetics of catalytic hydrogenations on PtSn surfaces compared to pure platinum surfaces."

1. The electronic structure of a surface is significantly altered by the addition of a second metal, allowing for precise tuning of the catalyst's properties for targeted reactions.
2. Hydrogen molecule dissociation is typically straightforward on transition metal surfaces, except for copper, gold, and silver.
3. The calculations revealed substantial variations in hydrogen mobility on the surface, offering a potential explanation for the altered catalytic activity resulting from tin doping of platinum.
4. The diffusion barriers on tin-doped surfaces are notably higher, with the highest barrier reaching nearly 100 kJ mol−1, compared to 5 kJ mol−1 on pure platinum surfaces.
5. This enhanced diffusion barrier has significant implications for the kinetics of hydrogenation reactions on PtSn surfaces versus pure platinum surfaces.

1. 添加第二金属会显著改变表面的电子结构，从而为调整目标反应催化剂的性质提供可能。
2. 氢分子在过渡金属表面上的分解通常很容易，除了铜、金和银。
3. 计算结果显示，氢原子在掺杂锡的表面的扩散存在巨大差异，这可能解释了铂基催化剂活性变化的原因。
4. 锡掺杂表面的扩散壁垒显著更高，最高可达近100 kJ mol−1，而纯铂表面仅为5 kJ mol−1。
5. 这种增强的扩散壁垒对铂锡合金表面与纯铂表面的氢化反应动力学具有重要影响。
