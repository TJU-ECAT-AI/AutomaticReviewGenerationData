[1] "The addition of a second metal to a surface will produce large perturbations in the electronic structure of that surface giving scope to fine tune the catalysts properties for the target reaction."
[2] "It has been observed that the addition of a second metal such as ruthenium, iron or tin can change the product distributions."
[3] "The atomclosest surface neighbour distance is sufficient to characterise the structure for adsorption of a single atom."
