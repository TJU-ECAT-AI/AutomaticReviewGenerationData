[1] "Fifteen healthy volunteers were studied by both spirometer and spiral CT at full inspiration and expiration in order to correlate their results, including total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), and residual volume (RV)."
[2] "3-D images were reconstructed from spiral CT, and we measured lung volumes at a corresponding CT window range."
[3] "Their volumes were compared with the pulmonary function test (paired t-test)."

The study involved fifteen healthy volunteers who underwent both spirometry and spiral CT at full inspiration and expiration. This was done to correlate their lung volumes, specifically total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), and residual volume (RV). Three-dimensional images were created from the spiral CT scans, and lung volumes were measured within a specific CT window range. These measured volumes were then compared to the results from the pulmonary function test using a paired t-test.

本研究涉及十五名健康志愿者，他们在完全吸气和呼气时同时接受了气流计和螺旋CT的检查。目的是将他们的肺容量（总肺容量TLC、潮气量VC和残余量RV）相关联。从螺旋CT扫描中创建了三维图像，并在特定的CT窗口范围内测量了肺容积。这些测量的体积然后与肺功能测试的结果进行了比较，使用配对t检验。
