How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

[1] "Fifteen healthy volunteers were studied by both spirometer and spiral CT at full inspiration and expiration in order to correlate their results, including total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC) and residual volume (RV)."
[2] "3-D images were reconstructed from spiral CT, and we measured lung volumes at a corresponding CT window range."
[3] "The window range corresponding to TLC was from -1000HU to -150HU (p=O.279, r = O .986), and for VC from -910HU to -800HU (p=O.366, r=O.954) in full-inspiratory CT."
[4] "The optimal window range for RV in full-expiratory CT was from -1000HU to -450HU (p=O.757, r = O.777), and TLC-VC in full-inspiratory CT was also calculated (p=O.843, r = 0.847)."

To evaluate the usefulness of spiral CT in measuring lung volumes, researchers conducted a study involving fifteen healthy volunteers. They utilized both spirometry and spiral CT at full inspiration and expiration to correlate their findings, focusing on total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), and residual volume (RV). The study involved reconstructing 3D images from spiral CT scans, which allowed for the measurement of lung volumes within specific CT window ranges. These ranges were optimized for accurate assessment of lung volumes. For TLC, the optimal window range was from -1000HU to -150HU, while for VC, it was from -910HU to -800HU in full-inspiratory CT. For RV, the best window range was determined to be from -1000HU to -450HU in full-expiratory CT. Additionally, the TLC-VC values were calculated in full-inspiratory CT, showing a strong correlation with pFT results.

为了评估螺旋CT在测量肺容积方面的实用性，研究人员对15名健康志愿者进行了研究。他们利用了肺功能计和螺旋CT，在全吸气和全呼气时进行对比分析，关注总肺容量（TLC）、肺活量（VC）和残余容积（RV）。研究中通过螺旋CT重建了三维图像，并在相应的CT窗口范围内测量了肺容积。这些窗口范围被优化以实现准确的肺容积评估。对于TLC，最佳窗口范围为从-1000HU到-150HU；而对于VC，在全吸气CT中，最佳窗口范围为从-910HU到-800HU。对于RV，在全呼气CT中，最佳窗口范围确定为从-1000HU到-450HU。此外，还计算了全吸气CT中的TLC-VC值，与肺功能测试结果表现出强相关性。

The study involved fifteen healthy volunteers who underwent both spirometry and spiral CT at full inspiration and expiration. This was done to correlate their lung volumes, specifically total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), and residual volume (RV). Three-dimensional images were created from the spiral CT scans, and lung volumes were measured within a specific CT window range. These measured volumes were then compared to the results from the pulmonary function test using a paired t-test.

Three-dimensional images were reconstructed from the spiral CT scans, and lung volumes were measured within a corresponding CT window range. These measurements were then compared with pulmonary function test data through a paired t-test. The optimal window ranges for TLC, VC, and RV were determined based on their correlation with the pulmonary function test results, providing a quantitative assessment of lung volumes using spiral CT imaging.
