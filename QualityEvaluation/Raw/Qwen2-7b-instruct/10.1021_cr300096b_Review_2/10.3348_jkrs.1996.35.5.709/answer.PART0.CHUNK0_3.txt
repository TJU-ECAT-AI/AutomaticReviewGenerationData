[1] "Fifteen healthy volunteers were studied by both spirometer and spiral CT at f inspiration and expiration in order to correlate their results, including total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC) and residual volume (RV)."
[2] "3-D images were reconstructed from spiral CT, and we measured lung volumes at a corresponding CT window range."
[3] "Their volumes were compared with the pulmonary function test (paired t-test)."
[4] "The window range corresponding to TLC was from -1000HU to -150HU (p=O.279, r = O .986), and for VC from -910HU to -800HU (p=O.366, r=O.954) in ωII - inspiratory CT."
[5] "The optimal window range for RV in full-expiratory CT was from -1000HU to -450HU (p=O.757, r = O.777), and TLC-VC in full-inspiratory CT was also calculated (p=O.843, r = 0.847)."

To evaluate the usefulness of spiral CT in measuring lung volumes, fifteen healthy volunteers underwent both spirometry and spiral CT at full inspiration and expiration. This allowed for the correlation of results, specifically total lung capacity (TLC), vital capacity (VC), and residual volume (RV). Three-dimensional images were reconstructed from the spiral CT scans, and lung volumes were measured within a corresponding CT window range. These measurements were then compared with pulmonary function test data through a paired t-test. The optimal window ranges for TLC, VC, and RV were determined based on their correlation with the pulmonary function test results, providing a quantitative assessment of lung volumes using spiral CT imaging.

为了评估螺旋CT在测量肺容量方面的实用性，对十五名健康志愿者进行了呼吸全吸气和全呼气时的肺功能仪和螺旋CT检查。这使得能够将结果相关联，具体包括总肺容量（TLC）、功能容积（VC）和残余体积（RV）。从螺旋CT扫描中重建了三维图像，并在相应的CT窗口范围内测量了肺容量。然后，将这些测量值与肺功能测试数据通过配对t检验进行比较。基于与肺功能测试结果的相关性，确定了TLC、VC和RV的最佳窗口范围，从而提供了使用螺旋CT成像定量评估肺容量的方法。
