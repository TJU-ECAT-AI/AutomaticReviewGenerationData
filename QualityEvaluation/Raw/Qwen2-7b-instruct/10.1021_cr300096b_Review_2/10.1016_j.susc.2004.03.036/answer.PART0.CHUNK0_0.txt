[3] "We use alkali ions along specific scattering geometries to measure the first and second layer chemical compositions."
[4] "The azimuthal scan after 3 min of Pt deposition suggests that the Pt is replacing Rh in the surface layer due to the loss of order observed in the Rh signal which could be expected for displaced Rh atoms."
[5] "The surface concentration CA of component A using geometry (i) is given by [15] (1) where IA is the scattered signal intensity (area below the peak) from chemical species A, NAS is the number of surface atoms per unit area on the pure element standard and IAS is the scattered signal intensity from the pure element standard."
[6] "After 6 min deposition we see very little Pt in the second layer from the 2 1 0 direction and no third and fourth layer contribution."
[7] "Although we are studying Pt/Rh bimetallic surfaces, impurity induced diffusion studies of Pt/Rh alloy surfaces may provide an answer as to why the Pt is diffusing into the Rh(100) sample."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves using techniques such as Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS). LEIS is a powerful surface-sensitive technique capable of determining chemical species and structure in real space. This process is crucial for structural modeling, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. For instance, by employing specific scattering geometries, researchers can measure the first and second layer chemical compositions of the bimetallic surfaces. Moreover, through azimuthal scans, they can observe how the Pt atoms replace Rh atoms in the surface layer, indicating the growth dynamics. Furthermore, by analyzing the intensity of scattered ions from specific geometries, they can calculate the surface concentration of elements in the top layers. This allows for detailed insights into the growth patterns and stability of the bimetallic surfaces under various conditions, which is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的研究，通过在单晶Pt（111）或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来合成这些双金属表面。这类研究通常采用低能离子散射（LEIS）技术进行表征。LEIS是一种强大的表面敏感技术，能够在真实空间中确定化学物种和结构。这一过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。例如，通过使用特定的散射几何形状，研究人员可以测量双金属表面的第一和第二层化学组成。此外，通过方位扫描，他们可以观察到铂原子如何取代铑原子在表面层中，这表明了生长动态。进一步地，通过分析特定几何形状下散射离子的强度，他们可以计算出顶层元素的表面浓度。这为深入了解在各种条件下双金属表面的生长模式和稳定性提供了详细见解，这对于推进表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
