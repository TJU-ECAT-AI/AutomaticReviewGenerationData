[1] "To prepare this surface in UHV, Pt must first be deposited on the Rh(100) substrate and hence the nature of the growth is of interest."
[2] "To study the growth, low energy ion scattering (LEIS) has been employed. LEIS is a powerful surface sensitive technique which is capable of determining chemical species and structure in real space."
[3] "Finally, the thermal stability of the deposited Pt was investigated. The Pt was seen to diffuse into the bulk of the Rh(100) crystal at approximately 700 K."
[4] "We believe this is due to C contamination as a consequence of the heating process."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows researchers to understand the structural properties of the bimetallic surface, which is essential for modeling the surface using computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT). Secondly, the detailed knowledge gained from such experiments enhances our understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, which is vital for their application in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition of Ni on Pt creates a unique interaction between the two metals, influencing the catalytic behavior of the surface. By studying the growth and stability of the bimetallic layer, scientists can predict how the surface will perform under various conditions, optimizing its use in applications requiring specific catalytic activity.
