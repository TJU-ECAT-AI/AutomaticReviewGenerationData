[1] "The Pt atoms were observed to assemble as single layer islands which coalesce into large islands after annealing at 300 C."
[2] "We investigate the room temperature growth of up to four layers of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface which are accessible by LEIS."
[3] "The growth of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface was then quantitatively investigated by ion scattering after incremental adsorption of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) substrate from the gas phase."
[4] "The Pt was seen to grow in a layer-by-layer fashion for at least the first two layers."
[5] "Finally, the thermal stability of the deposited Pt was investigated. The Pt was seen to diffuse into the bulk of the Rh(1 0 0) crystal at approximately 700 K."
[6] "The Pt was seen to adsorb in fcc sites and be incorporated into the Rh(1 0 0) surface layer."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The layer-by-layer growth of Pt on the Rh(100) surface is confirmed through quantitative ion scattering analysis. The Pt is observed to diffuse into the bulk of the Rh(100) crystal at around 700 K, which might be attributed to carbon contamination resulting from the heating process.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt（111）或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。通过定量离子散射分析证实了Pt在Rh（100）表面的逐层生长。在约700 K时，观察到Pt向Rh（100）晶体内部扩散，这可能归因于加热过程中产生的碳污染。
