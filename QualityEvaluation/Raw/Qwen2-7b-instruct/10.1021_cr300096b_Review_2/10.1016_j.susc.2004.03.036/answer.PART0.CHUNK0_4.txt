[1] "We use alkali ions along specific scattering geometries to measure the first and second layer chemical compositions."
[2] "The Pt atoms were observed to assemble as single layer islands which coalesce into large islands after annealing at 300 C."
[3] "This is in agreement with calculations based on the preceding formulation."
[4] "We believe this is due to C contamination as a consequence of the heating process."
[5] "The question is now why is the Pt diffusing into the bulk."
[6] "Unfortunately an estimation of the C contamination could not be made from the Li+ energy spectra."
[7] "It is interesting to note that the Pt has completely disappeared from the surface and not just been reduced as was the case for the alloy."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The deposition of Pt on Rh(100) leads to the formation of Pt atoms in fcc sites, suggesting incorporation into the Rh(100) surface layer. The growth is characterized as layer-by-layer for at least the first two monolayers, as confirmed by specific scattering geometries and polar scans. The thermal stability investigation reveals that the adsorbed Pt diffuses into the bulk of the Rh(100) crystal at approximately 700 K, attributed to C contamination caused by the heating process.
3. The process of depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt substrates is essential for detailed structural modeling and DFT calculations. This enables a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, which is fundamental for advancements in surface science and catalysis research.

1. 尼/铂双金属表面的表征涉及在铂（111）单晶或多晶铂基板上沉积镍单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，在先进的表面科学和催化研究领域中具有重要意义。
2. 在100 Rh表面上沉积铂导致铂原子聚集在立方体中心（fcc）位置，并融入Rh（100）表面层。实验发现，至少前两层的生长表现为逐层沉积。热稳定性研究表明，吸附在表面的铂在约700 K时扩散到Rh（100）晶体内部，这归因于加热过程中产生的碳污染。
3. 在铂基板上沉积镍单层的过程对于详细的结构建模和DFT计算至关重要。这使得对Ni/铂双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行全面理解成为可能，这对于表面科学和催化研究的进展具有重要意义。
