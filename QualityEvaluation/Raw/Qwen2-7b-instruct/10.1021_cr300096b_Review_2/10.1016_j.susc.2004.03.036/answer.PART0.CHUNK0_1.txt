<p>Epitaxial growth of metals on metals generally proceeds via one of three growth modes FM, SK or VW, named after the authors that first considered them [6]: Frankvan der Merwe (monolayer-by-monlayer), Stranski and Krastanov (monolayer then 3D crystallite growth), and Volmer and Weber (3D crystallite growth without a preceding adsorbed layer).</p>
<p>A simple approximation of the different growth modes can be formulated in terms of surface energy criteria [7]. If the adsorbate has a surface energy γA, the substrate a surface energy γS, and the interface between the two an energy γI, then Δγ=γA+γIγS0 will favour FM growth while Δγ=γA+γIγS>0 will favour the SK or VW mode.</p>
<p>The growth of submonolayer Pt on Rh(1 0 0) has been investigated by Ramstad et al. with high resolution photoemission [8]. The Pt atoms were observed to assemble as single layer islands which coalesce into large islands after annealing at 300 C.</p>
<p>We investigate the room temperature growth of up to four layers of Pt on the Rh(1 0 0) surface which are accessible by LEIS. The thermal stability of the adsorbed Pt is then investigated.</p>
<p>Finally, the thermal stability of a monolayer of Pt adsorbed on the Rh(1 0 0) surface was investigated. The Pt in the first atomic layer obtained using geometry (i), while Pt in the second layer is also shown obtained using geometry (ii).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The growth mode is governed by thermodynamic and kinetic factors dependent on the substrate/adsorbate combination. The surface energy criteria can predict the growth mode, with Δγ=γA+γIγS0 favoring FM growth and Δγ=γA+γIγS>0 favoring SK or VW mode. The growth of submonolayer Pt on Rh(1 0 0) involves the assembly of Pt atoms into single layer islands that coalesce into larger islands after annealing. The thermal stability of the adsorbed Pt on Rh(1 0 0) surface is also investigated, showing that the Pt diffuses into the bulk at 700 K, likely due to C contamination during heating.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。生长模式由依赖于基底/吸附剂组合的热力学和动力学因素决定。表面能量标准可以预测生长模式，其中Δγ=γA+γIγS0有利于FM生长，而Δγ=γA+γIγS>0有利于SK或VW模式。在Rh(1 0 0)表面上的亚单层Pt生长表现为Pt原子组装成单层岛屿，经过退火后这些岛屿合并成较大的岛屿。对吸附在Rh(1 0 0)表面的Pt的热稳定性进行了研究，结果显示，在700 K时，Pt向晶体内扩散，这可能是因为加热过程中C污染导致。
