The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows for a detailed examination of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The bimetallic surfaces' properties differ significantly from those of the parent metals due to the unique interaction between the two metals. This interaction affects the electronic structure, leading to changes in the d-band center, which in turn influences the binding energies of various species on the surface. The comprehensive understanding gained from such studies is pivotal in advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it helps in predicting and optimizing the catalytic activity of these materials for various chemical reactions.
