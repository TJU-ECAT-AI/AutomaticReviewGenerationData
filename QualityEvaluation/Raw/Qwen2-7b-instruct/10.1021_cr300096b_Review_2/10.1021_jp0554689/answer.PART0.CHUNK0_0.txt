The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying the relationship between the kinetic barriers of reactions, such as dehydrogenation, and the d-band center of the surface. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
