1. Introduction
Transition metals have been used as catalysts for many important industrial applications. It has been observed that the catalytic properties of transition-metal surfaces can be altered to markedly different degrees by alloying them with a second metal, that is, by forming a bimetallic catalyst. 1 This difference in reactivity occurs because bimetallic surfaces can exhibit quite different catalytic and electronic properties from the parent metal surfaces. A significant amount of work has investigated the catalytic, chemical, and electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces. 2-4 Commercial applications include their use as re-forming catalysts.1,5,6 Bimetallic combinations of Pt with Re, Sn, and Ir have been successfully used for naphtha re-forming. Bimetallic catalysts have also been investigated for important industrial chemistries such as hydrogenation, isomerization, hydrogenolysis, and oxidation.1 Roberti et al. have examined the use of Ni alloy catalysts for alkane isomerization. 7 Their studies indicate that alloying Ni with Cu improves the selectivity for hexane isomerization. Linic et al. have investigated the use of bimetallic catalysts for ethylene epoxidation. 8 They have shown by using theoretical calculations and experiments that Cu/Ag bimetallics are more selective for ethylene epoxidation than silver alone. Miyake and Asakawa have studied the use of Pd/Pb and Pd/Bi bimetallics as oxidation catalysts. 9 Their studies indicated that adding Pb to Pd drastically increases the selectivity for the production of methacrylate from methacrolein, while adding Bi to Pd increases the activity for production of benzyl acetate from toluene. Conversely, in the case of hydrogenolysis of hydrocarbons, it has been seen that the Cu/Ni and Cu/Ru catalysts exhibit lower activity than either monometallic Ni or Ru. 10,11 There has been substantial research on alloy catalysts for many years, beginning in the late 1940s, with the goal of correlating the electronic and catalytic properties of these systems.3 With the advent of bimetallic catalysts for hydrocarbon re-forming in the petrochemical industry in the 1970s, further interest regarding catalytic properties of the bimetallics was generated.1,3,5,6 In recent years, a significant amount of work has been done using advanced experimental and theoretical methods to correlate the electronic properties of model bimetallic surfaces with their chemical reactivity. Sautet et al. have studied theoretically the electronic structure and local adsorption properties of the Pt80Fe20(111) alloy surface and compared these to the properties of a Pt(111) surface using DFT. 12 They observed that iron atoms shift the d-band center away from the Fermi level and reduce the chemical reactivity of surface Pt atoms. Research done by Goodman et al. has shown that the CO desorption temperature in temperature programmed desorption experiments is strongly dependent on the core electron shift of bimetallic surfaces. 13 Hammer and Nrskov have used DFT to develop correlations between the electronic and catalytic properties of transition-metal surfaces. 14-16 They have convincingly shown that the valance-core level shift of monometallic and bimetallic transition-metal surfaces is related to the d-band center shift. Neurock et al. have shown correlations between the binding energies of ethylene and hydrogen and the d-band centers of bimetallic systems. 17,18 Mavrikakis et al. have developed similar correlations for CO, oxygen, and hydrogen. 19,20 Kitchin et al. have shown that the surface d-band is broadened and lowered in energy by subsurface 3d metals incorporated in the Pt(111) surface, resulting in weaker binding of hydrogen and oxygen on the bimetallic surfaces. 21-24 Previous work has provided insights into the reaction pathways of C2 hydrocarbons on transition-metal surfaces. Neurock and co-workers have studied the reaction pathways and intermediates for ethylene dehydrogenation on the Pd(111) surface.18 Their results indicate that the formation of acetylidene (CCH) is unlikely to be directly involved in the formation of ethylidyne (CCH3) from ethylene on Pd (111). Other studies have investigated the stability and reactivity of C2 hydrocarbons on Pt clusters. 25 With the use of DFT calculations, it has been shown that the primary reaction pathways for ethane hydrogenolysis on Pt involve highly hydrogenated species, such as C2H5(ads).25 Studies of acetylene adsorption on monometallic Pd, Pt, Ni, and Rh surfaces have indicated that acetylene binds very strongly on the Ni(111) surface compared to the other metal surfaces examined. 26 Overall, these studies have demonstrated that to understand the reaction pathways of C2 hydrocarbons on transition-metal surfaces, it is essential to understand the binding of the corresponding surface intermediates.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves several steps. First, the synthesis process itself is crucial for creating a bimetallic structure with distinct electronic and catalytic properties compared to the individual monometallic surfaces. This is achieved by carefully controlling the deposition of the Ni monolayer on the Pt substrate, which leads to the formation of a heterostructure with unique surface features.

For structural modeling and DFT calculations, the precise details of the bimetallic surface structure are essential. This includes determining the specific arrangement of Ni atoms within the Pt matrix, as well as the interactions between Ni and Pt atoms at the interface. Accurate knowledge of the surface morphology, such as the thickness of the Ni layer, the degree of surface roughness, and the presence of any defects, plays a critical role in predicting the electronic properties of the bimetallic surface.

The electronic properties of these bimetallic surfaces are of paramount importance in advanced surface science and catalysis research. DFT calculations are employed to correlate these properties with the chemical reactivity of the surfaces. The binding energies of various molecules to these surfaces, as well as the activation barriers for specific chemical reactions, are studied. These studies rely on understanding the electronic structure of the bimetallic surfaces, particularly the d-band center, which influences the reactivity and catalytic performance.

In the context of catalysis, the electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces are closely linked to their ability to promote or inhibit specific chemical transformations. By correlating the electronic structure with the chemical reactivity, researchers can gain insights into the reaction mechanisms and optimize the design of bimetallic catalysts for various industrial applications. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces thus provides a foundation for understanding and predicting their behavior in catalytic processes, leading to advancements in materials science and catalysis research.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The 2 × 2 unit cell with a coverage of 1/4 ML is justified by previous studies showing that this cell size eliminates repulsive interactions between neighboring molecules. The d-band center, which correlates with electronic properties and reactivity, is defined as the average energy of the d-band and calculated using the first moment of the projected density of states (DOS) on the surface atoms referenced to the Fermi level. Bimetallic surfaces exhibit different catalytic and electronic properties compared to their parent metals, affecting reactivity. Ethylene binding on bimetallic Pd/Mo is notably weaker than on pure Pd(111) or Mo(110). The interaction between metal d-orbitals and the antibonding orbitals of adsorbing species influences the strength of bonding. As the carbon-metal bond distance increases, the binding energy decreases for both acetylene and ethylene.
