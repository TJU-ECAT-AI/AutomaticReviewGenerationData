[6] "As noted earlier, whenever an unsaturated species such as ethylene or acetylene is bonded to a transition-metal surface, there is an interaction between the metal d-orbitals and the antibonding orbitals of the adsorbing species."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The 2 × 2 unit cell with a coverage of 1/4 ML is justified by previous studies showing that this cell size eliminates repulsive interactions between neighboring molecules. The d-band center, which correlates with electronic properties and reactivity, is defined as the average energy of the d-band and calculated using the first moment of the projected density of states (DOS) on the surface atoms referenced to the Fermi level. Bimetallic surfaces exhibit different catalytic and electronic properties compared to their parent metals, affecting reactivity. Ethylene binding on bimetallic Pd/Mo is notably weaker than on pure Pd(111) or Mo(110). The interaction between metal d-orbitals and the antibonding orbitals of adsorbing species influences the strength of bonding. As the carbon-metal bond distance increases, the binding energy decreases for both acetylene and ethylene.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单分子层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对高级表面科学和催化研究中这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。使用覆盖率为1/4 ML的2×2单元格，可以消除相邻分子之间的排斥作用，从而为结构建模、DFT计算提供支持。这一单元格大小由先前的研究证明。d能带中心，与电子特性和反应性相关联，定义为d能带的平均能量，并通过投影密度态（DOS）上的表面原子的第一刻度点来计算，参考费米能级。双金属表面相对于其母金属表现出不同的催化和电子特性，影响着它们的活性。钯/钼双金属上乙二烯的吸附强度明显弱于纯钯(111)或钼(110)。金属d轨道与吸附物种的反键轨道之间的相互作用影响了吸附强度。随着碳-金属键距离的增加，乙炔和乙烯的结合能会降低。
