[1] "The combination of DFT and BOC was used to study the relationship of reaction kinetics (activation barriers) to surface d-band center."
[2] "On the basis of the results and the analysis provided above, we can conclude the following:"
[3] "(1) Hydrogen-binding energies on the transition-metal surfaces vary linearly with the d-band center of the substrate."
[4] "(2) Trends in molecular adsorption are more complex than for those in atomic adsorption."
[5] "(3) Activation barriers for ethyl dehydrogenation to ethylene and vinyl dehydrogenation to acetylene also exhibit linear correlations with the d-band centers of the substrates."
[6] "(4) Activation barriers for these dehydrogenation reactions scale nearly linearly with hydrogen-binding energies on the surfaces considered in this study."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study their electronic and chemical properties. This process is crucial because it allows researchers to understand how the unique structure of these bimetallic surfaces influences their catalytic activity and reactivity. By employing DFT, scientists can predict and analyze the interactions of various molecules with the surface, leading to insights into the mechanisms of catalytic reactions. The DFT calculations provide a detailed description of the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of the bimetallic surfaces, which in turn helps in designing materials with optimized catalytic performance for specific industrial applications. The structural modeling and analysis through DFT contribute significantly to advancing the field of surface science and catalysis research by enabling a comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between surfaces and reacting molecules.
