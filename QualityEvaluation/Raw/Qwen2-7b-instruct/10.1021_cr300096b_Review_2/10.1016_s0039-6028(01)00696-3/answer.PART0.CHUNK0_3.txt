<p>The experiments were performed in a home-built low-temperature STM apparatus which is described elsewhere [7] ,[8] .</p>
<p>Pt(9 9 7) is a vicinal surface constituted by (1 1 1) terraces that have an average width of 20.1 Å separated by {1 1 1} monatomic steps.</p>
<p>In the absence of exchange, due to the small terrace width, deposition at temperatures above the onset of the adatom thermal mobility results in the growth of islands attached to the step edges [12] .</p>
<p>Remarkably, we find that exchange processes are active already at T=150 K and possibly below, meaning that the diffusion barriers which govern the concerted motion of Ni and Pt atoms are actually very low.</p>
<p>The ordered 1D phase which forms at the step edges consists of alternated Ni and Pt atoms. Its structure can be considered the 1D analogue of the NiPt3 alloyed phase in the bulk, since Ni atoms have only Pt neighbors.</p>
<p>Generally, the transition from a disordered to an ordered phase is a thermally activated process. Here, on the other hand, we suggest that the structural order observed at the step edges is due to kinetic limitations.</p>
<p>It is known that the Curie temperature of bulk NiPt compounds, for instance, has a strong dependence on the alloy composition and long-range spatial order [2] ,[3] .</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the investigation of how the surfaces' structure influences their functionality. The characterization helps in predicting and controlling the properties of the surfaces, such as their catalytic activity and magnetism, which are dependent on factors like the alloy composition and spatial order. The ability to synthesize surfaces with specific morphologies and compositions enables researchers to tailor materials for various applications, including catalysis and magnetic storage technologies.
