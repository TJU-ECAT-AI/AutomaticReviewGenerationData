<p>The atomic scale characterization of exchange and alloying processes in metal epitaxy provides a test for theories that model atomic interactions at surfaces. In addition, the ability to grow heterogenous films with controlled morphology and chemical composition can be used to investigate the influence of structural parameters on, e.g., the catalytic activity and the magnetism of an alloy.</p>
<p>Ni and Pt are known to form a continuous series of solid solutions in the bulk [16]. LDA and DFT calculations also show that Pt(1 1 1) has a lower surface energy than Ni(1 1 1) [17] and that Ni adatoms tend to diffuse into bulk Pt [18].</p>
<p>Remarkably, we find that exchange processes are active already at T=150 K and possibly below, meaning that the diffusion barriers which govern the concerted motion of Ni and Pt atoms are actually very low.</p>
<p>At T200 K Ni atoms form a 1D substitutional alloy at the step edges with 2×1 order and isolated random inclusions in the Pt terraces. Exchange processes are favored at step sites.</p>
<p>Deposition at T=300 K leads to the formation of a 2×2 alloy on the Pt terraces.</p>

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for testing theories that model atomic interactions at surfaces and for investigating how structural parameters impact the catalytic activity and magnetism of alloys. The characterization allows for the growth of heterogenous films with controlled morphology and chemical composition.

2. The synthesis process of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt substrates. This enables the investigation of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, contributing to advanced surface science and catalysis research. The ability to control the surface properties and composition is essential for understanding their behavior under various conditions and for optimizing their performance in applications such as catalysis and magnetism.
