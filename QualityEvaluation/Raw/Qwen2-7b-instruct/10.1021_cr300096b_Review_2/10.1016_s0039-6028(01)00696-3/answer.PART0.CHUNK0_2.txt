1. Deposition of a nickel monolayer at 300 Kelvin on a Pt(9 9 7) surface results in a 2×2 substitutional alloy, with a composition of approximately 20% nickel and 80% platinum, on the surface's uppermost layer.

2. At 200 Kelvin, nickel atoms form a one-dimensional ordered alloy along the step edges, featuring a 2×1 order, and isolated random inclusions within the Pt terraces.

3. The ordered one-dimensional phase that emerges at the step edges is akin to the 1D analog of the NiPt3 alloyed phase in bulk materials, with nickel atoms having only platinum neighbors.

4. Typically, the shift from a disordered to an ordered structure is a thermally driven process. However, in this case, the observed structural order at the step edges is attributed to kinetic constraints.

1. 在300开尔文时，沉积一层镍单层在Pt(9 9 7)表面上，表面顶层形成一种2×2位取代合金，镍和铂的比例约为20%和80%。

2. 在200开尔文时，镍原子在台阶边缘形成一维有序合金，具有2×1排列，并在Pt台面上有孤立的随机掺入。

3. 在台阶边缘形成的有序一维相与纯材料中NiPt3合金的1D等效相类似，镍原子仅与铂邻接。

4. 通常，从无序到有序结构的转变是由热驱动的过程。然而，在此情况下，台阶边缘观察到的结构秩序归因于动力学限制。
