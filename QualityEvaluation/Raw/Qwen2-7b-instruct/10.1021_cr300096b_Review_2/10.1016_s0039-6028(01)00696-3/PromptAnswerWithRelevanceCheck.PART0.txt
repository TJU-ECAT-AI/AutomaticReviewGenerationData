[1] "The atomic scale characterization of exchange and alloying processes in metal epitaxy provides a test for theories that model atomic interactions at surfaces."
[2] "In addition, the ability to grow heterogenous films with controlled morphology and chemical composition can be used to investigate the influence of structural parameters on, e.g., the catalytic activity and the magnetism of an alloy."
[3] "The NiPt system constitutes an interesting candidate for investigations: NiPt alloys have a high catalytic selectivity for certain reactions [1] and show a strong interplay between magnetic and spatial order [2], [3]."
[4] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."
[5] "Exchange processes are shown to be favored at step sites."
[6] "At T200 K Ni atoms form a 1D substitutional alloy at the step edges with 2×1 order and isolated random inclusions in the Pt terraces."
[7] "Deposition at T=300 K leads to the formation of a 2×2 alloy on the Pt terraces."

1. Deposition of a nickel monolayer at 300 Kelvin on a Pt(9 9 7) surface results in a 2×2 substitutional alloy, with a composition of approximately 20% nickel and 80% platinum, on the surface's uppermost layer.

2. At 200 Kelvin, nickel atoms form a one-dimensional ordered alloy along the step edges, featuring a 2×1 order, and isolated random inclusions within the Pt terraces.

3. The ordered one-dimensional phase that emerges at the step edges is akin to the 1D analog of the NiPt3 alloyed phase in bulk materials, with nickel atoms having only platinum neighbors.

4. Typically, the shift from a disordered to an ordered structure is a thermally driven process. However, in this case, the observed structural order at the step edges is attributed to kinetic constraints.
