[1] "The atomic scale characterization of exchange and alloying processes in metal epitaxy provides a test for theories that model atomic interactions at surfaces."
[2] "In addition, the ability to grow heterogenous films with controlled morphology and chemical composition can be used to investigate the influence of structural parameters on, e.g., the catalytic activity and the magnetism of an alloy."
[3] "The NiPt system constitutes an interesting candidate for investigations: NiPt alloys have a high catalytic selectivity for certain reactions [1] and show a strong interplay between magnetic and spatial order [2], [3]."
[4] "Despite previous results [6] showing that the first Ni monolayer grows pseudomorphically on Pt(1 1 1) at room temperature, we find that on Pt(9 9 7), in the whole temperature range addressed by this study (150300 K), a large fraction of Ni atoms exchanges with Pt substrate atoms, thus forming a surface alloy."
[5] "Exchange processes are shown to be favored at step sites."
[6] "At T200 K Ni atoms form a 1D substitutional alloy at the step edges with 2×1 order and isolated random inclusions in the Pt terraces."
[7] "Deposition at T=300 K leads to the formation of a 2×2 alloy on the Pt terraces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows for the investigation of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. Specifically, the Ni/Pt system exhibits high catalytic selectivity for certain reactions and demonstrates a strong interplay between magnetic and spatial order. By studying the exchange and alloying processes during deposition, researchers can gain insights into the surface chemistry and potentially control the catalytic activity and magnetism of the alloy. The characterization process also enables the examination of how structural parameters influence these properties, providing a basis for understanding and predicting the behavior of bimetallic surfaces in various applications, including catalysis and magnetic materials research.
