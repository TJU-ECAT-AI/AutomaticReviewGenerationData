<p>These results are particularly relevant to the field of electrocatalysis where changes in catalytic activity can be attributed to ensemble effects (or morphological effects), structure effects due to changes in local bond geometry and electronic (or ligand) effects where a metal's reactivity is modified directly.</p>
<p>Given that Pt and Pd are neighboring elements in the periodic table and that their lattice constants differ by <1%, a monolayer of Pd on Pt(1 1 1) represents a catalytic system in which only a pure electronic effect is expected.</p>
<p>By utilizing SXS, in combination with voltammetric experiments to provide adsorption isotherms, it is possible to build up a detailed picture of the surface atomic geometry during the CO-oxidation process.</p>
<p>No changes in the Pd surface coverage occur over the range 0.00.85 V, the upper limit being the potential at which CO oxidation occurs.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows for the detailed examination of the atomic structure and surface relaxation of the bimetallic surfaces. The Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces can be studied using techniques like surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to understand their electronic and chemical properties. This approach helps in linking the physical properties of the surface with its chemical reactivity, which is particularly important in electrocatalysis. By correlating changes in the atomic structure and surface relaxation with surface chemical reactions, researchers can gain insights into how the surface modifications affect the catalytic activity. The process is essential for developing models that incorporate surface relaxation effects and for advancing the field of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
