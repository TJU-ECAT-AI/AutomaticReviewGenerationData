[1] "The results show that the PdPt layer spacing contracts at the onset of CO oxidation before the Pd adlayer forms an oxide structure that is incommensurate with the Pt lattice."
[2] "By utilizing SXS, in combination with voltammetric experiments to provide adsorption isotherms, it is possible to build up a detailed picture of the surface atomic geometry during the CO-oxidation process."
[3] "Compared to the bulk PtPt spacing in the (1 1 1) direction (2.266 Å), it can be stated that the PtPd spacing is expanded by 2.3% both in the presence of adsorbed hydrogen and adsorbed CO."
[4] "For the Pd/Pt(1 1 1) system, a careful reciprocal space search was made in an attempt to locate scattering from an ordered CO adlayer."
[5] "The analysis of the CTRs indicates that the adsorption of CO on the Pd/Pt surface causes no changes in the atomic structure or surface relaxation."
[6] "There is no significant pre-oxidation peak on the Pd/Pt surface."
[7] "Considering only the anodic sweep, it is clear from the (0,1,0.5) data that no changes in the Pd surface coverage occur over the range 0.00.85 V."
[8] "As the intensities shown are normalized to the scattered intensity measured at 0.05 V, the change in the PtPd spacing necessary to reproduce the intensity ratios, R, (R=0.8 and R=1.5 for l=3.6 and l=4.4 respectively) can be calculated."
[9] "Regardless of the exact nature of the PdO structure, however, the key result is that the reaction is fully reversible and the Pd monolayer is recovered at 0.05 V."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves several steps. First, the surfaces are characterized using surface X-ray scattering (SXS) and voltammetric techniques to understand the surface atomic geometry and chemical reactions. This process is crucial because it allows researchers to correlate changes in the atomic structure and surface relaxation with the surface chemical reactions. The information gathered from these techniques helps in developing models that include surface relaxation effects, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The findings contribute to advanced surface science and catalysis research by providing insights into how different metals interact and how these interactions influence catalytic activities.
