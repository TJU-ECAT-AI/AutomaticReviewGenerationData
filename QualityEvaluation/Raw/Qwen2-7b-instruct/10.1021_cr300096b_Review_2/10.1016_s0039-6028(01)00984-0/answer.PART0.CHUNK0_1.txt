<p>These results are particularly relevant to the field of electrocatalysis where changes in catalytic activity can be attributed to ensemble effects (or morphological effects), structure effects due to changes in local bond geometry and electronic (or ligand) effects where a metal's reactivity is modified directly.</p>
<p>The experimental work has been supported and motivated by theoretical calculations in which, for example, a strong correlation was found between molecular chemisorption energies and the location of the d-band center of the surface metal atoms.</p>
<p>In this letter we extend these results to a bimetallic system, namely a monolayer of Pd on the Pt(1 1 1) electrode surface.</p>
<p>Given that Pt and Pd are neighboring elements in the periodic table and that their lattice constants differ by <1%, a monolayer of Pd on Pt(1 1 1) represents a catalytic system in which only a pure electronic effect is expected.</p>
<p>By utilizing SXS, in combination with voltammetric experiments to provide adsorption isotherms, it is possible to build up a detailed picture of the surface atomic geometry during the CO-oxidation process.</p>
<p>For the Pd/Pt(1 1 1) surface, however, it appears that CO adsorption has no effect on the lattice expansion at the surface.</p>
<p>The absence of the pre-oxidation wave may be due to the blocking of active Pt sites for OH adsorption by strongly-adsorbed bisulfate anions.</p>
<p>The data in Fig. 3 essentially show two structural effects which are separated in the figure by the vertical marker line at 0.85 V.</p>
<p>As the intensities shown are normalized to the scattered intensity measured at 0.05 V, the change in the PtPd spacing necessary to reproduce the intensity ratios, R, (R=0.8 and R=1.5 for l=3.6 and l=4.4 respectively) can be calculated.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. The relevance to electrocatalysis is that changes in catalytic activity can be attributed to various factors such as ensemble effects, morphological effects, structure effects due to changes in local bond geometry, and electronic effects where a metal's reactivity is modified directly. Theoretical calculations support this by finding correlations between molecular chemisorption energies and the location of the d-band center of surface metal atoms. The use of Surface X-ray Scattering (SXS) combined with voltammetric experiments enables the building of a detailed picture of the surface atomic geometry during catalytic reactions, providing insights into the bimetallic system's behavior.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模至关重要，因为它使研究者能够理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质。这一过程与电催化作用相关，因为催化剂活性的变化可以归因于多种因素，如集体效应、形态效应、由于局部键几何变化导致的结构效应以及直接修改金属反应性的电子效应或配体效应。理论计算支持这一点，通过发现分子化学吸附能与表面金属原子位置的d带中心之间的关联。通过使用表面X射线散射（SXS）结合伏安法实验，研究人员能够构建出催化反应过程中表面原子几何结构的详细图景，从而提供有关双金属系统行为的见解。
