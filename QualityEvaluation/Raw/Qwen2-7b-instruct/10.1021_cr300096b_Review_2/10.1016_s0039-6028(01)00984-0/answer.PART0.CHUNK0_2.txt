[1] "Given that Pt and Pd are neighboring elements in the periodic table and that their lattice constants differ by <1%, a monolayer of Pd on Pt(1 1 1) represents a catalytic system in which only a pure electronic effect is expected."
[2] "In this work the latter method was used. Briefly, before each experiment the Pt(1 1 1) electrode was flame annealed and cooled down in a H2+Ar atmosphere. After that, the surface was protected with a droplet of ultrapure water and mounted into the disk position of an insertable rotating ring-disk electrode assembly (Pine Instruments)."
[3] "The amount deposited was controlled by the continuous change of the voltammetric features characteristic of a pseudomorphic monolayer film of palladium, for details see Ref. [15]."
[4] "Finally, the Pd-modified Pt(1 1 1) electrode was rinsed with water and transferred either to a second electrochemical cell or into the X-ray cell containing a solution free of Pd2+."
[5] "Fig. 1 shows the specular [(0,0,l)] and first-order, non-specular [(1,0,l) and (0,1,l)] CTRs measured at 0.05 V and after the solution had been saturated with CO."
[6] "The analysis of the CTRs indicates that the adsorption of CO on the Pd/Pt surface causes no changes in the atomic structure or surface relaxation."
[7] "For the Pt(1 1 1)/CO system previous measurements have shown that a p(2×2)-CO structure is formed at 0.0 V with a coverage of 0.75 CO molecules per surface Pt atom."
[8] "We have performed a detailed SXS study of this structure which is observed both in pure acid solutions and in the presence of other metallic species where displacement of the metal from the Pt surface occurs to allow formation of the close-packed CO adlayer."
[9] "Fig. 2 compares the polarization curves obtained for the Pt(1 1 1) surface (solid lines) and Pd/Pt(1 1 1) surface (dashed lines) as the potential was cycled from 0.0 to 1.1 V in CO-saturated solution."
[10] "The second structural effect illustrated in Fig. 3 occurs when the electrode potential is scanned positive of 0.85 V where continuous oxidation of CO is occurring."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. DFT calculations benefit from this precise control as they rely on accurate structural information to predict electronic and chemical properties. The comprehensive understanding of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research is greatly enhanced by the ability to tailor the surface composition and structure, enabling insights into how these factors influence catalytic activity and reactivity.

2. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves several steps. First, the Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline substrate is prepared by flame annealing and cooling in a H2+Ar atmosphere. This ensures a clean surface suitable for deposition. A droplet of ultrapure water is then used to protect the surface during the deposition process. The Ni monolayer is deposited using a technique that controls the amount of material based on the characteristic voltammetric features of a pseudomorphic monolayer film of palladium, as detailed in reference [15]. After deposition, the electrode is rinsed with water and transferred to either a second electrochemical cell or into an X-ray cell free of Pd2+, ensuring the surface is ready for further analysis.

3. The characterization includes examining the structure of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces through various techniques. Surface X-ray scattering (SXs) provides insights into the atomic structure and surface relaxation. The results indicate that the adsorption of CO on the Ni/Pt surface does not cause changes in the atomic structure or surface relaxation. This is important for understanding the stability and reactivity of the surface under different conditions.

4. Previous measurements on Pt(111) surfaces have shown that at 0.0 V, a p(2×2)-CO structure forms with a coverage of 0.75 CO molecules per surface Pt atom. This structure is observed both in pure acid solutions and in the presence of other metallic species that might displace the metal from the Pt surface to facilitate the formation of the close-packed CO adlayer. This information is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of CO adsorption and its impact on surface properties.

5. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces also involves studying the polarization curves of the surfaces as the potential is cycled through different values in CO-saturated solutions. These curves compare the Pt(111) surface (solid lines) with the Pd/Pt(111) surface (dashed lines) and reveal differences in the electrooxidation of CO and the presence of a pre-oxidation peak, which is attributed to the ordering of the p(2×2)-CO adlayer on the Pt(111) surface. The polarization curves provide valuable information on the surface chemistry and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces.

6. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces further examines the structural changes that occur during the oxidation and adsorption of CO. Figure 3 presents the X-ray intensity measurements at specific reciprocal lattice positions as the electrode potential is cycled over a range in CO-saturated solution. The data reveals two distinct structural effects: one associated with the contraction of the PdPt layer spacing upon CO oxidation, and another related to the rearrangement of the adsorbed Pd monolayer accompanying CO oxidation. These findings highlight the reversible nature of the reactions and the interplay between electronic and structural changes on the bimetallic surface.

1.Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模至关重要，因为它允许研究人员精确控制双金属表面的组成和结构。第一性原理计算受益于这种精确控制，因为它们依赖于准确的结构信息来预测电子和化学性质。在先进表面科学和催化研究中，对这些双金属表面的全面理解大大得益于能够调整表面组成和结构的能力，从而深入了解这些因素如何影响催化活性和反应性。

2. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征包括几个步骤。首先，通过火焰退火和在H2+Ar气氛中冷却，准备Pt(111)单晶或多晶基底。这确保了表面清洁，适合沉积。随后使用超纯水滴保护表面，防止在沉积过程中与大气接触。通过控制电压变化的特征来沉积Ni单层，这些特征是钯伪同质薄膜的特征，详情见参考文献[15]。沉积后，电极用水冲洗，并转移到第二个电解质细胞或含有无Pd2+溶液的X射线细胞中，以确保表面准备好进行进一步分析。

3. 表征包括通过各种技术研究Ni/Pt双金属表面的结构。表面X射线散射（SXs）提供了有关原子结构和表面松弛的信息。结果表明，CO吸附在Ni/Pt表面上不会引起原子结构或表面松弛的变化。这对于理解在不同条件下表面的稳定性和反应性至关重要。

4. 在Pt(111)表面上的先前测量显示，在0.0伏时形成p(2×2)-CO结构，覆盖率为每表面Pt原子0.75个CO分子。这种结构在纯酸溶液中以及在可能从Pt表面置换金属以促进CO紧密堆积吸附层形成的其他金属物种的存在下均被观察到。这些信息对于了解CO吸附机制及其对表面性质的影响至关重要。

5. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征还包括研究CO氧化和吸附过程中表面电位循环时的极化曲线。这些曲线比较了在饱和CO溶液中循环电压的Pt(111)表面（实线）与Pd/Pt(111)表面（虚线），揭示了CO电氧化和预氧化峰的存在，该峰归因于在Pt(111)表面上p(2×2)-CO吸附层的排列。这些极化曲线提供了关于双金属表面化学和反应性的宝贵信息。

6. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征进一步研究了CO氧化和吸附过程中发生的结构变化。图3展示了在饱和CO溶液中随着电位在特定范围内循环时，特定倒易点处的X射线强度测量结果。数据揭示了两个不同的结构效应：与CO氧化引起的PdPt层间距收缩相关联的一个，以及伴随CO氧化时吸附Pd单层重新排列的另一个。这些发现突出了反应的可逆性以及电子和结构变化在双金属表面之间的相互作用。
