[1] "Thin transition metal films supported on single crystal metal surfaces have been studied in great detail in order to establish a link between the physical properties of a surface and its chemical reactivity."
[2] "These results are particularly relevant to the field of electrocatalysis where changes in catalytic activity can be attributed to ensemble effects (or morphological effects), structure effects due to changes in local bond geometry and electronic (or ligand) effects where a metal's reactivity is modified directly."
[3] "By utilizing SXS, in combination with voltammetric experiments to provide adsorption isotherms, it is possible to build up a detailed picture of the surface atomic geometry during the CO-oxidation process."
[4] "In this work the latter method was used. Briefly, before each experiment the Pt(1 1 1) electrode was flame annealed and cooled down in a H2+Ar atmosphere."
[5] "After that, the surface was protected with a droplet of ultrapure water and mounted into the disk position of an insertable rotating ring-disk electrode assembly (Pine Instruments)."
[6] "The amount deposited was controlled by the continuous change of the voltammetric features characteristic of a pseudomorphic monolayer film of palladium, for details see Ref. [15]."
[7] "Finally, the Pd-modified Pt(1 1 1) electrode was rinsed with water and transferred either to a second electrochemical cell or into the X-ray cell containing a solution free of Pd2+."
[8] "The X-ray experiments were performed on beamline 7-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) using a monochromatic incident X-ray beam of energy 10 keV defined by slits to be a 1×1 mm2 spot at the sample."
[9] "In order to study the adsorption of CO, the outer shell of the X-ray electrochemical cell was purged with CO (99.99% purity), instead of nitrogen which is usually used to prevent interaction of the surface with the atmosphere."
[10] "The reciprocal space notation is for the conventional hexagonal unit cell for the (1 1 1) surface such that the surface normal is along the (0,0,l)hex direction and the (h,0,0)hex and (0,k,0)hex vectors lie in the plane of the surface and subtend 60."
[11] "Fig. 1 shows the specular [(0,0,l)] and first-order, non-specular [(1,0,l) and (0,1,l)] CTRs measured at 0.05 V and after the solution had been saturated with CO."
[12] "The solid lines in Fig. 1 are a calculated best fit to the data using a structural model in which the Pd coverage (θPd), PtPd distance (dPtPd), relaxation of the Pt surface (εPt) and surface roughness parameters (σPd, σPt) were varied."
[13] "For the Pt(1 1 1)/CO system previous measurements have shown that a p(2×2)-CO structure is formed at 0.0 V with a coverage of 0.75 CO molecules per surface Pt atom."
[14] "We have performed a detailed SXS study of this structure which is observed both in pure acid solutions and in the presence of other metallic species where displacement of the metal from the Pt surface occurs to allow formation of the close-packed CO adlayer."
[15] "In the absence of SXS data regarding the CO adlayer, information regarding the surface coverage by CO and the oxidation of CO can be obtained from RDE measurements (as described in Ref. [25])."
[16] "Fig. 2 compares the polarization curves obtained for the Pt(1 1 1) surface (solid lines) and Pd/Pt(1 1 1) surface (dashed lines) as the potential was cycled from 0.0 to 1.1 V in CO-saturated solution."
[17] "Download: Download full-size image Fig. 3. The X-ray intensity measured at three reciprocal lattice positions (indicated in Fig. 1 ) as the potential was cycled over the range 0.051.15 V (sweep rate=2 mV/s)."
[18] "Considering only the anodic sweep, it is clear from the (0,1,0.5) data that no changes in the Pd surface coverage occur over the range 0.00.85 V, the upper limit being the potential at which CO oxidation occurs (see Fig. 2 )."
[19] "As the intensities shown are normalized to the scattered intensity measured at 0.05 V, the change in the PtPd spacing necessary to reproduce the intensity ratios, R, (R=0.8 and R=1.5 for l=3.6 and l=4.4 respectively) can be calculated."
[20] "Regardless of the exact nature of the PdO structure, however, the key result is that the reaction is fully reversible and the Pd monolayer is recovered at 0.05 V."
[21] "In summary, we have shown that a model catalytic system in which the modifications in the catalytic activity can be attributed to a pure electronic effect can be probed, in situ, by SXS and voltammetric techniques to correlate changes in the atomic structure and surface relaxation with the surface chemical reactions."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties because it allows for the establishment of a link between surface physical properties and chemical reactivity. The use of Surface X-ray Scattering (SXS) in conjunction with voltammetric experiments enables the construction of a detailed picture of the surface atomic geometry during the oxidation process. This method provides insights into how changes in the surface structure and relaxation correlate with chemical reactions on the surface.

2. The characterization process begins with flame annealing the Pt(111) electrode followed by cooling it in a H2+Ar atmosphere. The surface is then protected with ultrapure water and mounted into a rotating ring-disk electrode assembly. The amount of Ni deposited is controlled by the continuous change in voltammetric features indicative of a pseudomorphic monolayer film of palladium. The electrode is then rinsed with water and transferred to either a second electrochemical cell or an X-ray cell without Pd2+.

3. X-ray experiments are conducted using a monochromatic beam of 10 keV energy with a 1×1 mm2 spot size at the sample. To study CO adsorption, the outer shell of the X-ray electrochemical cell is purged with 99.99% CO instead of nitrogen to prevent surface interaction with the atmosphere. The reciprocal space notation for the (1 1 1) surface includes vectors that define the surface normal and the surface plane.

4. The characterization involves measuring and modeling Crystal Truncation Rods (CTRs) to determine the precise structure of the Pt(1 1 1)Pd surface. A detailed structural model is used to fit the CTR data, which provides information on the Pd coverage, PtPd distance, surface relaxation, and roughness parameters. The model assumes that Pd atoms occupy Pt three-fold hollow sites while maintaining the ABC stacking of the bulk lattice.

5. A p(2×2) structure of CO is formed on the Pt(1 1 1) surface at 0.0 V with a coverage of 0.75 CO molecules per surface Pt atom. Detailed Surface X-ray Scattering (SXS) studies of this structure are performed in both pure acid solutions and in the presence of other metallic species, allowing for the observation of the close-packed CO adlayer. The absence of SXS data on the CO adlayer leads to the use of Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) measurements to obtain information on the surface coverage and CO oxidation.

6. Comparison of polarization curves for the Pt(1 1 1) surface and the Pd/Pt(1 1 1) surface reveals that the CO coverage on the Pd/Pt surface is identical to that observed on the Pt surface. Integration of the CO stripping voltammetry peaks under the stripping curves provides the total charge, which is equivalent to 0.65 CO molecules per surface Pt (or Pd) atom. The electrooxidation of CO is shifted anodically on the Pd/Pt(1 1 1) surface by 0.1 V, indicating differences in OH adsorption or PdCO bond strength compared to PtCO.

7. Potentiodynamic Surface X-ray Scattering (SXS) measurements show that the CO oxidation reaction causes a large contraction of the PdPt surface, approximately 1% compared to the PtPt bulk spacing. This lattice contraction may reflect the expected PdPt bond length in the absence of strong chemisorption on the surface. The process is fully reversible, and the Pd monolayer is recovered at 0.05 V. This indicates that CO oxidation is accompanied by oxidation of the Pd monolayer, which is fully reversible over the measured potential range.

8. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces provides insights into the electronic and chemical properties through the study of surface structure, relaxation, and chemical reactions. This information is essential for developing models that incorporate surface relaxation effects, advancing the field of surface science and catalysis research.

1. 尼/铂双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶铂或聚晶铂基底上沉积镍单层。这一过程对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及我们对电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它允许建立表面物理属性与化学反应之间的联系。通过结合表面X射线散射（SXS）和伏安法实验，可以构建出表面原子几何结构的详细图像，在氧化过程中进行监测。这种方法提供了结构和表面反应之间关联的洞察，包括表面结构和松弛如何与表面化学反应相关联。

2. 表征过程从火焰退火Pt(111)电极开始，随后在H2+Ar气氛中冷却。然后，表面用超纯水保护并安装到插入式旋转环盘电极装配的盘位置。通过连续改变伏安特征来控制Ni的沉积量，这些特征是伪同质单层钯薄膜的标志。最后，将修改后的Pt(111)电极用水冲洗，并转移到不含Pd2+的第二个电解质细胞或X射线细胞。

3. 使用斯坦福同步辐射实验室（SSRL）的第7-2束线上的单色X射线束进行X射线实验，该束的能量为10 keV，定义为1×1 mm2的光斑大小。为了研究CO吸附，外壳中的X射线电解池被99.99%的CO净化，而不是通常用于防止表面与大气相互作用的氮气。对于（1 1 1）表面，互反空间表示包括定义表面法线和表面平面的向量。

4. 表征涉及测量和拟合晶体截断棒（CTRs）以确定Pt(1 1 1)Pd表面的精确结构。使用一个详细的结构模型来拟合CTR数据，提供有关Pd覆盖、PtPd距离、表面松弛和粗糙度参数的信息。模型假设Pd原子位于Pt三重空位位置，同时保持原始晶格的ABC堆叠。

5. 在0.0 V时，Pt(1 1 1)表面上形成了一个p(2×2)结构的CO，每表面Pt原子有0.75个CO分子。对这种结构进行了详细的表面X射线散射（SXS）研究，在酸性溶液中以及存在其他金属物种的情况下，观察到了紧密堆积的CO吸附层。缺乏关于CO吸附层的SXS数据导致使用旋转圆盘电极（RDE）测量来获取表面覆盖度和CO氧化的信息。

6. 比较Pt(1 1 1)表面和Pd/Pt(1 1 1)表面的极化曲线显示，Pd/Pt表面上的CO覆盖度与Pt表面上观察到的相同。通过剥离电压曲线下的峰积分获得的总电荷相当于每个表面Pt（或Pd）原子0.65个CO分子。CO的电氧化在Pd/Pt(1 1 1)表面上向阳偏移0.1 V，这可能归因于OH吸附的抑制或PdCO键强度高于PtCO。

7. 功率动态表面X射线散射（SXS）测量表明，CO氧化反应导致PdPt表面发生显著收缩，约为1%与原始铂铂间距相比。这种晶格收缩可能反映了表面缺少强化学吸附时预期的PdPt键长。该过程是可逆的，在0.05 V时恢复Pd单层。这表明CO氧化伴随着Pd单层的氧化，这是一个在整个测量的电位范围内完全可逆的过程。

8. 对尼/铂双金属表面的表征提供了电子和化学性质的见解，包括表面结构、松弛和化学反应的研究。这些信息对于开发包含表面松弛效应的模型至关重要，从而推动表面科学和催化研究领域的进展。
