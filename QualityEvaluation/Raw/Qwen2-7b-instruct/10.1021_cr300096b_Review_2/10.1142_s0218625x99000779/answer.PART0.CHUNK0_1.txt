[1] "In order to generate pure Pt pyramids of the size and density shown in Fig. 5, an average Pt coverage of 4 physical monolayers would be required;this is much greater than the 0.8 physical monolayer used here."
[2] "As mentioned previously, it is important to note that pyramids are not Pt clusters; rather, they are composed of tungsten and covered with a thin film Pt.9,10"
[3] "The STM data confirm the LEEM observations that a partially faceted surface is a combination of large planar regions, with scattered faceted regions."
[4] "LEEM indicates the lack of a nucleation and growth type transition from the planar to a faceted structure, and suggests the uniform roughening of the surface instead."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which are essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
