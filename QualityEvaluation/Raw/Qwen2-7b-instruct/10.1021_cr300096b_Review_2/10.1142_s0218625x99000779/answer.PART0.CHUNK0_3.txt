The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is essential for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insight into the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) offers atomic-level structural details, while Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM) provides a unique capability for imaging surfaces at high temperatures, making it advantageous for studying the kinetics of large-scale morphological transformations. The combination of these techniques enables researchers to comprehensively understand the properties of bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
