[1] "In order to generate pure Pt pyramids of the size and density shown in Fig. 5, an average Pt coverage of 4 physical monolayers would be required;this is much greater than the 0.8 physical monolayer used here."
[2] "As mentioned previously, it is important to note that pyramids are not Pt clusters; rather, they are composed of tungsten and covered with a thin film Pt.9,10"
[3] "The STM data confirm the LEEM observations that a partially faceted surface is a combination of large planar regions, with scattered faceted regions."
[4] "LEEM indicates the lack of a nucleation and growth type transition from the planar to a faceted structure, and suggests the uniform roughening of the surface instead."
