1. Three-sided pyramids with {211} sides have been identified as facets using low energy electron diffraction and atomic resolution STM.
2. The pyramids identified as facets are actually composed of tungsten with a thin layer of adsorbate covering them.
3. A partially faceted surface is characterized by a mix of large flat areas and scattered faceted regions, as confirmed by both STM and LEEM observations.
4. Each faceted area is seen as a collection of pyramidal facets of varying sizes.

1. 三面体结构，具有{211}边的晶面，通过低能电子衍射和原子分辨率扫描隧道显微镜（STM）已被识别为晶面。
2. 被识别为晶面的金字塔实际上是由钨构成的，上面覆盖着一层吸附剂薄膜。
3. 半晶化表面由大面积的平坦区域和散落的晶化区域组成，这一发现得到了STM和LEEM观察结果的证实。
4. 每个晶化区域被看作是不同大小的金字塔晶面的集合。
