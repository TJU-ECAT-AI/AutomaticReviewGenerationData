1. To create pure Pt pyramids of the depicted size and density, an average Pt coverage of 4 physical monolayers would be required, significantly exceeding the 0.8 physical monolayer utilized in the experiment.
2. The faceting transition does not happen spontaneously at room temperature, owing to kinetic constraints.
3. The primary benefit of Low Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM) is its ability to visualize surfaces in real time, even at high temperatures or during material deposition.
4. A sequence of bright field LEEM images illustrating the nucleation and growth of faceted regions on a Pt/W(111) surface at a constant temperature (1050 K) and a steady Pt flux. The dosing times are 63, 69, 75, 81, 87, and 93 minutes for images 3(a) through 3(f), respectively, with a field of view of 5 meters.
5. Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) offers structural information at the atomic level.

1. 创造大小和密度与图5中所示相匹配的纯Pt金字塔，平均需要4个物理单层的Pt覆盖，这远远超过了实验中使用的0.8个物理单层。
2. 在室温下，晶面的晶化转换不会自发发生，这是由于动力学限制。
3.LEEM的主要优势是能够实时成像表面，甚至在高温或材料沉积时也能进行。
4. 一系列明亮场LEEM图像展示了在恒定温度（1050 K）和恒定Pt通量下，Pt/W(111)表面的晶核形成和生长过程。记录时间分别为63、69、75、81、87和93分钟，对应于3(a)至3(f)图像，视野为5米。
5. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）提供原子级别的结构信息。
