To characterize Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, powerful spectroscopic tools such as low energy alkali ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS) are employed. ALISS utilizes a probing ion beam, typically 1 keV Li+, to gather structural information. The Thomas-Fermi-Molire (TFM) potential is often applied to interpret these measurements. The choice of the [100] azimuth is made because it aligns with the single atomic chain of Sn atoms across all proposed structural models, ensuring model independence. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for advancements in surface science and catalysis research.

为了表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面，使用强大的光谱工具，如低能碱离子散射光谱（ALISS）来获取信息。ALISS利用1 keV Li+作为探针束来收集结构信息。通常应用Thomas-Fermi-Molire（TFM）势能进行解释这些测量。选择[100]方位角是因为它与所有提出的所有结构模型中Sn原子链的单个原子链对齐，确保了模型独立性。这个过程对于理解双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，这对于表面科学和催化研究的进展非常重要。
