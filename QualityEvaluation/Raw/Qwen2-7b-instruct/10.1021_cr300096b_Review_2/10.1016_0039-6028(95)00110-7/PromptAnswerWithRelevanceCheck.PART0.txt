1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the preparation of ordered bimetallic or alloy substrates that exhibit remarkable thermal stability in terms of their geometric structure and composition. The surface structures derived from this methodology are not necessarily limited to those from the termination of a bulk single crystal alloy, providing a basis for predictive insights into the structures of other bimetallic surfaces.

1. Establishing the conditions for alloy formation and utilizing powerful spectroscopic tools, particularly low energy alkali ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS), are crucial for advancing our understanding of the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. ALISS has proven to be a valuable tool for elucidating the structures of these surfaces, as demonstrated in previous studies and continued in this work.

2. The Sn doser used in the experiments was fabricated from a boat made of 0.13 mm thick tantalum foil containing a high-purity tin ingot. Before use, the doser underwent thorough outgassing to ensure cleanliness.

3. An AES uptake plot was acquired that was remarkably similar to the one presented by Paffett et al., providing a consistent method for calibrating Sn coverages on the Pt(100) surface.

4. Figures showing polar angle scans for Li+-Pt scattering on both the p(1 × 1)-Pt(100) surface and the clean (5 x 20)-Pt(100) surface are included in the document. These scans are essential for determining the scattering potentials of the respective materials.

5. Choosing the [100] azimuth for the c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100) surface in the structural analysis was based on the assumption that Sn atoms would align in a single chain along this direction across all proposed structural models, ensuring model independence.

1. 在先进表面科学和催化研究领域，通过确定合金形成条件并利用强大的光谱工具（尤其是低能碱离子散射光谱法）来确定其结构对于进步至关重要。先前的研究已经证明了ALISS在这些方面非常有用，并且在本工作中我们继续使用它作为主要的结构探针。

2. 实验中使用的Sn剂量器是由厚度为0.13毫米的钽箔制成的封闭容器，内含纯度为6N的锡锭。在使用前，剂量器经过彻底的脱气处理以确保清洁度。

3. 一个AES吸收图被获取，与Paffett等人展示的非常相似，为校准Pt(100)表面上的Sn覆盖提供了稳定的方法。

4. 包括显示沿[100]和[110]方位角扫描的Li+-Pt散射在p(1×1)-Pt(100)表面和干净的(5 x 20)-Pt(100)表面的图示，这些扫描对于确定相应材料的散射势非常重要。

5. 选择c(2 × 2)-Sn/Pt(100)表面的[100]方位角进行结构分析是基于假设Sn原子将沿着这个方向排列成单个链，这适用于所有提出的结构模型，从而实现模型独立性。
