1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for the preparation of ordered bimetallic or alloy substrates that exhibit remarkable thermal stability. These stable surface structures facilitate a deeper understanding of the origins of altered chemistry on alloy surfaces, particularly concerning the relative importance of electronic and ensemble effects on chemical reactions. Establishing the conditions for alloy formation and determining their structure using advanced spectroscopic techniques is essential for advancing knowledge in surface science and catalysis research.
