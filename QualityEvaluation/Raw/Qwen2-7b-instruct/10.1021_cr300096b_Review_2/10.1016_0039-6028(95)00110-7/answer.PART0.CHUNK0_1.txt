<p>Our interest in the Sn/Pt(100) system stems from catalysis. Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts are used com- mercially in hydrocarbon reforming and it is plausi- ble that Pt-Sn alloy surfaces may play a role in this catalysis. Therefore, studies of the surface chemistry of different crystal faces of Pt-Sn alloys are ex- pected to yield useful information for understanding these catalytic reactions.</p>
<p>The key to advances in this arena is establishing the conditions under which alloys are formed and determining their structure subsequently using powerful spectroscopic tools. Low energy al- alkali ion scattering spectroscopy (ALISS) has proven to be very useful in these regards previously [2,4,6] and we continue to use it as the primary structural probe in this work.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through the deposition of a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, followed by structural modeling and DFT calculations. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it helps in elucidating how the bimetallic structure influences catalytic activity and reactivity pathways.
