1. The experiments were carried out using a modified SX-700 monochromator at the National Synchrotron Radiation Facility MAX-LAB in Lund, Sweden, specifically at beam line 22.
2. After depositing tin and annealing to 600°C, a distinct p(2 X 2)R30 LEED pattern emerged.
3. The Pt 4f,,? core level spectrum of the clean surface alloy revealed a single surface peak that was shifted 0.25 eV below the bulk peak.
4. Hydrogen adsorption on the Sn/Pt surface alloy did not alter the Sn 4d core level spectrum, whereas significant alterations occurred in the Pt 4f 7,2 spectrum.
5. The Pt,Sn interaction enthalpy utilized in the calculations was -52 kJ/mol, as documented in literature [18].
6. The Pt,Sn interaction enthalpy utilized in the calculations was -52 kJ/mol, as documented in literature [18].
