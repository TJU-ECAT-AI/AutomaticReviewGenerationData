Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using synchrotron radiation techniques. This involves employing a modified SX-700 monochromator and a 200 mm radius hemispherical analyser of Scienta type. The sample, in this case, is a 2 mm thick, 1.5 cm disk of Pt(111), both sides polished mechanically up to 0.5 μm. Tin deposition is performed using a tungsten filament evaporator. An excellent p(1/2 X 1/2)R30 LEED pattern is obtained after depositing about 1/3 monolayer of tin and subsequent annealing at 600°C for 3 min. Atomic hydrogen is dosed at -80°C with the sample located approximately 5 cm away from the heated tungsten filament. The results show that adsorption of atomic hydrogen does not change the LEED pattern or the shape of the Sn 4d spectrum. The Pt 4f, ,? core level spectrum from the clean surface alloy indicates a single surface peak shifted -0.25 eV relative to the bulk. Hydrogen adsorption on the Sn/Pt surface alloy modifies the Pt 4f, ,? level drastically, while the Sn 4d core level remains unaffected. The adsorption site of atomic hydrogen on the surface alloy is indicated by calculations performed for the hydrogen-covered clean Pt(l11) surface.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层进行。采用同步辐射技术进行表征，使用修改后的SX-700单色器和Scienta类型的200毫米半球形分析仪。样品为2mm厚、直径1.5cm的Pt(111)，两面机械抛光至0.5μm。锡沉积使用钨丝蒸发器完成。在沉积约1/3单层锡并随后在600°C下退火3分钟后，可以获得出色的p(1/2 X 1/2)R30 LEED图案。在-80°C时，将样品放置在加热的钨丝灯丝约5cm远处进行氢气剂量。结果表明，原子氢吸附既不改变LEED模式也不改变Sn 4d谱的形状。从清洁表面合金的Pt 4f, ,?核心级谱中可以看出，相对于基体有一个单个表面峰，偏移了-0.25 eV。氢吸附在Sn/Pt表面合金上，Pt 4f, ,?级别发生了剧烈变化，而Sn 4d核心级别保持不变。氢吸附在表面合金上的位置由用于清洁Pt(l11)表面的氢覆盖表面的计算指示。
