1. The platinum-tin system is particularly significant due to its application in hydrocarbon conversion and selective hydrogenation reactions.
2. Hydrogen adsorption does not alter the Sn 4d core level's profile but introduces a new surface component in the Pt 4f spectrum, shifted by 0.59 eV from the bulk peak.
3. To counteract the lattice mismatch between tin and platinum, the surfaces buckle, displacing Sn atoms outward by 0.30 Å and 0.23 Å, respectively, as measured by Z/V LEED for the p(2 X 2) and p(& X fi)R30 surface alloys.
4. The surface peak in the Pt 4f spectrum from the clean surface alloy is shifted -0.25 eV from the bulk peak.
5. Atomic hydrogen adsorption on the Pt( 111 )(fi X fi)R30-Sn surface does not affect the LEED pattern or the Sn 4d spectrum's shape.
6-8. Descriptions of recording Pt 4f spectra from a clean Pt(1 1 1) surface at room temperature with a photon energy of 125 eV.

1. 铂锡系统特别重要，因为它用于烃类转化和选择性氢化反应。
2. 氢吸附不会改变Sn 4d核心水平的轮廓，但在Pt 4f光谱中出现了一个新表面成分，相对于基体峰偏移了0.59 eV。
3. 为了补偿锡和铂之间的晶格失配，表面弯曲，Sn原子分别向外移动了0.30 Å和0.23 Å，这是通过Z/V LEED测量的，对应于p(2 X 2)和p(& X fi)R30表面合金。
4. 清洁表面合金的Pt 4f光谱中的表面峰值相对于基体峰值偏移了-0.25 eV。
5. 氢原子吸附在Pt( 111 )(fi X fi)R30-Sn表面上，既不改变LEED图案也不改变Sn 4d光谱的形状。
6-8. 在室温下记录从清洁Pt(1 1 1)表面以125 eV光子能量的Pt 4f光谱的描述。
