[1] "A quantitative investigation of the stacking and structure of ultrathin lms of Pt deposited on a Cu (1 1 1) surface has been carried out by a combination of real space low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diraction (LEED) techniques."
[2] "At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu (1 1 1) in the layer-by-layer mode."
[3] "The Pt lms have the regular fcc stacking up to 5 Monolayers (ML) determined by measuring the incident angle dependence asso- ciated with shadowing eects."
[4] "The thermal treatment of the Pt lms (from monolayer up to ve layers) triggered the Pt diusion and mixing with the Cu substrate to form a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy over at least three atomic lay- ers."
[5] "We have shown that the incident angle depen- dence associated with shadowing eects at special geometrical conditions using low energy alkali ion scattering can be used to monitor in detail the stacking sequence in the growth of fcc Pt on Cu (1 1 1) upto 5 ML."

This study investigates the stacking and structure of platinum films on a copper (1 1 1) surface through the use of low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) techniques. The research confirms that at room temperature, platinum deposits epitaxially on copper in a layer-by-layer manner. The structure is found to consist of a regular face-centered cubic (fcc) stacking up to five monolayers, as determined by the incident angle dependence associated with shadowing effects. Upon heating, the platinum films mix with the copper substrate to form a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy across at least three atomic layers. Low energy alkali ion scattering enables detailed monitoring of the stacking sequence in the growth of platinum films on copper, providing insights into the precise layer-by-layer structure and the formation of the surface alloy.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows for precise control and measurement of the stacking sequence, thickness, and orientation of the surfaces. By using techniques such as low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED), researchers can monitor the layer-by-layer growth of the bimetallic film, determine the distances and orientations between surface nearest neighbor (NN) atoms, and assess the formation of surface alloys, such as Cu3Pt, under specific annealing conditions. These methods provide valuable insights into the structural and chemical behavior of bimetallic surfaces, which are essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

This study examines the stacking and structure of ultrathin films of platinum (Pt) deposited on a copper (Cu) (1 1 1) surface. The researchers utilized low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) techniques to analyze the Pt films' characteristics. At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu (1 1 1) in a layer-by-layer manner. The Pt films exhibit regular face-centered cubic (fcc) stacking up to five monolayers, as determined by measuring the incident angle dependence associated with shadowing effects. Upon thermal treatment, the Pt films diffuse and mix with the Cu substrate, forming a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy over at least three atomic layers. The Pt-N-N atomic spacing is found to be compressed by 7% relative to pure Cu, indicating that the first layer of Pt atoms are in normal registry positions. As the film thickness increases, the transition from the Cu-bound distance to the equilibrium Pt-bound distance occurs gradually. At five monolayers, a Pt (1 1 1)-like structure is formed. The annealing process reveals that Pt films on Cu (1 1 1) undergo intermixing with the substrate at moderate temperatures, leading to the formation of a stable surface alloy.
