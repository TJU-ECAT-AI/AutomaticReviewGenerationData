[1] "By ion scattering it is found that the Pt NN value (compressed by 7%) is close to that of pure Cu,indicating that the first overlayer Pt atoms are in normal registry positions."
[2] "With increasing coverages, the transition from the Cu bound distance to the equilibrium Pt bound distance occurs (not abrupt)."
[3] "At 5 ML, a Pt (1 1 1)-like structure is formed. This finding has been further confirmed by our LEED data."
[4] "Our annealing results reveal that Pt films on Cu (1 1 1) undergo intermixing with the substrate at moderate temperatures."
[5] "Under appropriate annealing conditions 573 K, this leads to the formation of a stable surface alloy."
[6] "The results strongly suggest that the stoichiometry of the surface alloy formed is Cu3Pt."
[7] "A comparison of the Pt and Cu a scans between a surface alloy and Cu3Pt (1 1 1) bulk alloy indicates that there are at least three layers of Cu3Pt."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows for precise control and measurement of the stacking sequence, thickness, and orientation of the surfaces. By using techniques such as low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED), researchers can monitor the layer-by-layer growth of the bimetallic film, determine the distances and orientations between surface nearest neighbor (NN) atoms, and assess the formation of surface alloys, such as Cu3Pt, under specific annealing conditions. These methods provide valuable insights into the structural and chemical behavior of bimetallic surfaces, which are essential for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它允许对表面堆叠序列、厚度和方向进行精确控制和测量。通过使用低能离子散射（LEIS）和低能电子衍射（LEED）等技术，研究者可以监测双金属薄膜的逐层生长，确定表面近邻（NN）原子之间的距离和方向，并评估在特定退火条件下形成的表面合金，如Cu3Pt。这些方法提供了关于双金属表面结构和化学行为的重要见解，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。
