1. The base pressure in the UHV chamber was 7*10^-11 mbar after bakeout, rising to 4*10^-10 mbar during evaporation.
2. The (1 1) LEED pattern was observed for room temperature Pt deposition regardless of the coverage.
3. The NN atomic spacing was determined for the first five layers of Pt.
4. This finding was further confirmed by our LEED data.
5. By ion scattering, it was found that the Pt NN value, compressed by 7%, is similar to that of pure Cu, suggesting that the first layer of Pt atoms are in normal registry positions.
6. Our annealing results show that Pt films on Cu (1 1 1) undergo intermixing with the substrate at moderate temperatures.
7. The results strongly indicate that the composition of the surface alloy formed is Cu3Pt.

1. 等离子体高真空室的基压在烘烤后为7*10^-11 mbar，蒸发过程中上升至4*10^-10 mbar。
2. 在室温下，（1 1）LEED图案被观察到，与覆盖度无关。
3. 第五层Pt的NN原子间距被确定。
4. 这一发现进一步得到了我们的LEED数据的证实。
5. 通过离子散射，发现压缩了7%的Pt NN值接近纯Cu，表明第一层Pt原子处于正常登记位置。
6. 我们的退火结果显示，在适中的温度下，Pt薄膜与Cu（1 1 1）基底发生互扩散。
7. 结果强烈表明形成的表面合金组成是Cu3Pt。
