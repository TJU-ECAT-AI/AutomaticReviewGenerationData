[1] "A quantitative investigation of the stacking and structure of ultrathin films of Pt deposited on a Cu (1 1 1) surface has been carried out by a combination of real space low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) techniques."
[2] "At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu (1 1 1) in the layer-by-layer mode."
[3] "The Pt films have the regular fcc stacking up to 5 Monolayers (ML) determined by measuring the incident angle dependence associated with shadowing effects."
[4] "The thermal treatment of the Pt films (from monolayer up to five layers) triggered the Pt diffusion and mixing with the Cu substrate to form a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy over at least three atomic layers."
[5] "By ion scattering, it is found that the Pt NN value (compressed by 7%) is close to that of pure Cu, indicating that the first overlayer Pt atoms are in normal registry positions."
[6] "With increasing coverage, the transition from the Cu bound distance to the equilibrium Pt bound distance occurs (not abrupt)."
[7] "At 5 ML, a Pt (1 1 1)-like structure is formed."

This study examines the stacking and structure of ultrathin films of platinum (Pt) deposited on a copper (Cu) (1 1 1) surface. The researchers utilized low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) techniques to analyze the Pt films' characteristics. At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu (1 1 1) in a layer-by-layer manner. The Pt films exhibit regular face-centered cubic (fcc) stacking up to five monolayers, as determined by measuring the incident angle dependence associated with shadowing effects. Upon thermal treatment, the Pt films diffuse and mix with the Cu substrate, forming a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy over at least three atomic layers. The Pt-N-N atomic spacing is found to be compressed by 7% relative to pure Cu, indicating that the first layer of Pt atoms are in normal registry positions. As the film thickness increases, the transition from the Cu-bound distance to the equilibrium Pt-bound distance occurs gradually. At five monolayers, a Pt (1 1 1)-like structure is formed. The annealing process reveals that Pt films on Cu (1 1 1) undergo intermixing with the substrate at moderate temperatures, leading to the formation of a stable surface alloy.

这项研究探讨了在铜（Cu）（1 1 1）表面沉积的超薄铂（Pt）薄膜的堆叠和结构。研究人员利用低能量离子散射（LEIS）和低能量电子衍射（LEED）技术分析了Pt薄膜的特性。在室温下，Pt在Cu（1 1 1）上以层状方式生长。Pt薄膜表现出到五层原子层的规律的面心立方（fcc）堆叠，这是通过测量与阴影效应相关的入射角度依赖性确定的。热处理后，Pt薄膜扩散并与Cu基体混合，形成至少三层原子层的Cu3Pt（1 1 1）类似表面合金。发现Pt-N-N原子间距相对于纯Cu压缩了7%，这表明第一层Pt原子处于正常的注册位置。随着薄膜厚度的增加，从Cu结合距离到平衡Pt结合距离的过渡逐渐发生。在五层时，形成了一个Pt（1 1 1）类似的结构。热处理显示，在中等温度下，Pt薄膜与Cu（1 1 1）基体混合，导致形成稳定的表面合金。
