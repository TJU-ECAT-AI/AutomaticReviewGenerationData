[1] "A quantitative investigation of the stacking and structure of ultrathin lms of Pt deposited on a Cu (1 1 1) surface has been carried out by a combination of real space low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diraction (LEED) techniques."
[2] "At room temperature, Pt grew epitaxially on Cu (1 1 1) in the layer-by-layer mode."
[3] "The Pt lms have the regular fcc stacking up to 5 Monolayers (ML) determined by measuring the incident angle dependence asso- ciated with shadowing eects."
[4] "The thermal treatment of the Pt lms (from monolayer up to ve layers) triggered the Pt diusion and mixing with the Cu substrate to form a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy over at least three atomic lay- ers."
[5] "We have shown that the incident angle depen- dence associated with shadowing eects at special geometrical conditions using low energy alkali ion scattering can be used to monitor in detail the stacking sequence in the growth of fcc Pt on Cu (1 1 1) upto 5 ML."

This study investigates the stacking and structure of platinum films on a copper (1 1 1) surface through the use of low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) techniques. The research confirms that at room temperature, platinum deposits epitaxially on copper in a layer-by-layer manner. The structure is found to consist of a regular face-centered cubic (fcc) stacking up to five monolayers, as determined by the incident angle dependence associated with shadowing effects. Upon heating, the platinum films mix with the copper substrate to form a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy across at least three atomic layers. Low energy alkali ion scattering enables detailed monitoring of the stacking sequence in the growth of platinum films on copper, providing insights into the precise layer-by-layer structure and the formation of the surface alloy.

这项研究通过低能离子散射（LEIS）和低能电子衍射（LEED）技术，对铜（1 1 1）表面的铂薄膜的堆叠和结构进行了定量研究。研究表明，在室温下，铂在铜上以层状模式进行外延生长。结构由到五个单层的面心立方（fcc）堆叠组成，这是通过关联阴影效应的入射角度依赖性确定的。加热后，铂薄膜与铜基体混合形成一个Cu3Pt（1 1 1）-类似表面合金，至少跨越三层原子层。低能碱离子散射使我们能够详细监测铜上铂薄膜生长过程中的堆叠序列，提供了关于精确层状结构和表面合金形成机制的见解。
