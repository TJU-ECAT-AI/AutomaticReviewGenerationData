1. The lattice parameter of the first Pt layer is equivalent to that of pure Cu, confirming its normal registry position.
2. Upon annealing at 573 K, a Cu3Pt (1 1 1)-like surface alloy is formed from the monolayer to 5 ML coverage.
3. The LEED pattern positions and Pt signals at grazing incidence have been used to determine the ordering and symmetry of Pt films up to 5 ML.
4. Ion scattering reveals that the first Pt layer atoms maintain a close proximity to Cu, with a slight compression of 7%.

1. 第一层铂层的晶格参数与纯铜相匹配，证实了其正常的位置。
2. 在573 K的退火处理下，从单层到5 ML覆盖范围，形成了一种类似于Cu3Pt（1 1 1）的表面合金。
3. 利用LEED模式位置和掠入射测量的铂信号，确定了铂薄膜直到5 ML的排列和对称性。
4. 离子散射显示第一层铂原子与Cu保持密切接触，压缩了7%。
