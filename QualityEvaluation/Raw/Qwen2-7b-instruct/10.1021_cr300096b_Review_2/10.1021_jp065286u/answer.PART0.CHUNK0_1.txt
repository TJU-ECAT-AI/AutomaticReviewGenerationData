[2] "Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to investigate the CO stretching frequency changes when a CO molecule was adsorbed to Pt/Au clusters of 24 atoms."
[3] "Our calculations have demonstrated that the adsorption site is the most sensitive quantity to the CO stretch frequency changes."
[4] "All the bridge site adsorptions yield a CO frequency band of 17371927 cm-1 with the CO bond distance of 1.1671.204 Å regardless of cluster composition and size, and all atop site adsorptions yield a CO frequency band of 20002091 cm-1 with the CO bond distance of 1.1511.167 Å."
[5] "The insensitivity of the CO frequency shift to the cluster size indicates that the trend discussed here for small clusters may be used to interpret the experimental observations for nanoparticles."
[6] "Our results also illustrated that the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurement may be used as a sensitive tool to identify adsorption sites of the Pt/Au nanoparticles using CO adsorption as the probe."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows for the investigation of the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. By studying the adsorption of CO molecules on these surfaces through density functional theory calculations, researchers can understand the behavior of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
