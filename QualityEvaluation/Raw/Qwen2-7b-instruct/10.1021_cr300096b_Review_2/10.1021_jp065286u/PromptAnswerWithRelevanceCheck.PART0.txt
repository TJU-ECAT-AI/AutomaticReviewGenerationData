<p>In our recent work,7,8 about 100 Pt/Au clusters ranging from the dimer up to 13-atom clusters have been studied. Formation energies of these Pt/Au clusters were obtained and compared with those of the corresponding bulk alloy.</p>
<p>The CO frequencies as a function of cluster size are plotted in Figure 1. The data points above the dashed line correspond to the atop adsorptions, and the data points below the dashed line correspond to the bridge site adsorptions. In both the atop and bridge adsorptions, the CO frequency decreases only slightly with the cluster size. The majority of the CO frequencies are overlapping among three sizes.</p>
<p>In order to explore the relationship between the frequency and composition, we plotted CO frequencies as a function of Pt compositions in Figure 2. Again, there is a clear CO frequency distinction between the atop adsorptions (the data points above the dashed line) and the bridge adsorptions (the data points below the dashed line). In the atop adsorptions, the CO frequency is shifted the most when CO is adsorbed to the trimer and tetramer alloys in comparison with the pure corresponding Pt or Au isomers. In the bridge site adsorptions, the CO frequency is the largest at 50% Pt content for the dimer and 25% and 50% Pt content for the tetramers. A linear decrease of CO frequency with Pt content is observed for the adsorption with trimers. These different trends indicate that studies of more cluster sizes are needed in order to extrapolate the results of small clusters to the experimental observations where the particle sizes are in the range of 110 nm.</p>
<p>The CO frequencies as a function of CO bond distances are plotted in Figure 3. The data points above the dashed line correspond to the atop adsorptions, and the data points below the dashed line correspond to the bridge site adsorptions. It is clear that there exists a rather nice correlation between the CO bond distance and the CO stretching frequency in both atop and bridge adsorptions. The frequency decreases with the increase of CO bond distance, for both atop and bridge site adsorptions, though a better correlation is found for atop adsorptions.</p>
<p>The CO frequencies as a function of adsorption energies are plotted in Figure 4. The points above the dashed line are for the atop adsorptions, and the points below the dashed line are for the bridge site adsorptions. Figure 4 illustrates that the adsorption energy is not correlated to the adsorption site; rather it is closely correlated to the atoms to which the CO is attached. All three points at the adsorption energy below 1 eV correspond to the C atom attaching to two Au atoms. This indicates that the adsorption is the weakest when CO is adsorbed to the bridge site attaching to two Au atoms.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that there is no direct correlation between the CO frequency and the adsorption energy because these two quantities are the reflection of two different bonding environments. The CO frequency is a direct consequence of the C and O bonding, whereas the adsorption energy is the consequence of the metal atom and C bonding. Although one type of bond may affect the other, there are no direct correlations. This can be seen clearly in the examination of density of states (DOSs) of the atoms in an adsorption complex. In Figures 5-8, we plotted the DOSs of four adsorption complexes, the 10th to 13th structures in Table 2. In the stronger adsorption complex shown in Figure 5, two visible bonding peaks between the C and O atoms exist in the DOS with one peak below 20 eV and the other around 5 eV. However, in the weaker adsorption complex shown in Figure 6, the peak corresponding to the CO bonding at about 5 eV disappeared and was replaced by a peak around 10 eV with a less population of DOS. This indicates a weaker CO bond and a larger CO frequency shift in the weaker adsorption complex. The comparison between the DOSs of two adsorption complexes in Figures 7 and 8 shows the same trend. In the case of a strong adsorption, i.e., Figure 7, three peaks are visible between the C and O atoms. But only two peaks are visible in the DOSs of the C and O atoms in Figure 8. We also point out that an sd2 hybridization takes place for the Au atom in both adsorption complexes shown in Figures 7 and 8. Zhai et al. found an sd hybridization in the CO adsorption to a Au6 cluster. 27</p>

Answer: How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is conducted through computational methods such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations. These calculations allow researchers to model the surfaces' structure, understand the electronic and chemical properties, and predict their behavior in catalytic applications. The process is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Structural Modeling**: DFT calculations provide insights into the atomic arrangement and bonding within the bimetallic layer, helping to confirm the successful deposition of the Ni monolayer on the Pt substrate. This includes identifying specific adsorption sites for molecules like CO, which can influence the surface reactivity and catalytic efficiency.

2. **Understanding Electronic Properties**: Through DFT, the electronic structure of the bimetallic surfaces can be analyzed, revealing details such as band gaps, energy levels, and the nature of electronic transitions. This knowledge is essential for predicting how the surfaces will interact with reactants and products in catalytic reactions.

3. **Chemical Properties**: DFT calculations can simulate the adsorption of various molecules onto the surface, allowing researchers to assess the stability of these interactions and predict reaction rates and mechanisms. For instance, in the case of CO adsorption on Pt/Au bimetallic clusters, the frequency shifts and bond distances provide information about the strength of the interaction and the coordination environment around the metal atoms.

4. **Catalysis Research**: The detailed understanding gained from DFT calculations helps in optimizing the design of catalysts for specific applications. By tailoring the surface properties—such as the composition and arrangement of atoms—it is possible to enhance catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability, which are critical factors in industrial processes like water-gas shift reactions, emission control, and methanol fuel cells.

In summary, the computational characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces through DFT calculations is indispensable for advancing the field of surface science and catalysis. It enables the development of more efficient and selective catalysts, contributing significantly to advancements in energy production, environmental protection, and materials science.
