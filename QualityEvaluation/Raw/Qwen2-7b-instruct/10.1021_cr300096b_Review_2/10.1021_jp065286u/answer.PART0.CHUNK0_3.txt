[1] "Our calculations have demonstrated that the adsorption site is the most sensitive quantity to the CO stretch frequency changes. All the bridge site adsorptions yield a CO frequency band of 17371927 cm-1 with the CO bond distance of 1.1671.204 Å regardless of cluster composition and size, and all atop site adsorptions yield a CO frequency band of 20002091 cm-1 with the CO bond distance of 1.1511.167 Å."
[2] "The results show that the CO frequency decreases linearly with the increase of CO bond length."
[3] "Furthermore, the results suggest that the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurement may be used as a sensitive tool to identify adsorption sites of Pt/Au nanoparticles using the CO adsorption as a probe."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves examining the adsorption sites, sizes, and compositions of the bimetallic clusters. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. 

2. The sensitivity of the CO stretching frequency to the adsorption site indicates that the CO frequency decreases linearly with the increase of CO bond length. This provides insights into the interactions between CO and the surface atoms, aiding in the interpretation of experimental observations.

3. The use of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as a sensitive tool to identify adsorption sites of Pt/Au nanoparticles using CO adsorption offers a non-invasive method to characterize the surfaces. This technique can be instrumental in elucidating the structure-property relationships in bimetallic catalysts.
