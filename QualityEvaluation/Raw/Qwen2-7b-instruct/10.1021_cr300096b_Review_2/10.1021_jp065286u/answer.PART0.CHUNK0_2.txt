[1] "DFT calculations were performed to study the CO stretching frequency shifts when a CO molecule was adsorbed to Pt/Au clusters of 24 atoms."
[2] "Our calculations have demonstrated that the adsorption site is the most sensitive quantity to the CO stretch frequency changes."
[3] "All the bridge site adsorptions yield a CO frequency band of 17371927 cm-1 with the CO bond distance of 1.1671.204 Å regardless of cluster composition and size."

[5] "More detailed analysis of both frequency bands shows that each band may consist of two emerging subbands with the lower frequencies corresponding to the CO adsorption to Pt atoms and the higher frequencies to the CO adsorption to Au atoms."
[6] "The insensitivity of the CO frequency shift to the cluster size indicates that the trend discussed here for small clusters may be used to interpret the experimental observations for nanoparticles."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The DFT calculations highlight that the adsorption site is the most sensitive factor affecting the CO stretching frequency. Bridge site adsorptions result in a CO frequency band of 1737 to 1927 cm-1, while atop site adsorptions yield a band of 2000 to 2091 cm-1. Detailed analysis reveals two subbands within each band, with lower frequencies corresponding to CO adsorption to Pt atoms and higher frequencies to CO adsorption to Au atoms. The insensitivity of the CO frequency shift to cluster size suggests that the findings for small clusters can be applied to interpret experimental observations for nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is identified as a sensitive tool to identify adsorption sites on Pt/Au nanoparticles using CO adsorption as a probe.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征方法包括在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。DFT计算表明，吸附位点是影响CO伸缩频率最敏感的因素。桥接位点吸附产生1737至1927 cm-1的CO频率带，而顶点位点吸附产生2000至2091 cm-1的频率带。详细分析显示每个带内有两组子带，较低频率对应于CO吸附到Pt原子，较高频率对应于CO吸附到Au原子。CO频率变化对簇尺寸的不敏感性表明，针对小型簇的发现可以应用于解释纳米粒子实验观察。傅里叶变换红外光谱被确认为识别Pt/Au纳米粒子上的吸附位点的敏感工具，使用CO吸附作为探针。
