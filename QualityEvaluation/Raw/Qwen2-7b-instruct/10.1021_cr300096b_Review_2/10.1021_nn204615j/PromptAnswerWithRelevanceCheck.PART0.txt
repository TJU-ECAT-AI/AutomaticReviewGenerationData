[1] "We have now found that the presence of surface carbon on Re(1121), if followed by annealing in vacuum, causes faceting of Re(1121); that is, an initially planar Re(1121) surface becomes nanotextured to expose new crystal faces on the nanometer scale."
[2] "The Pt ML supported on the faceted C/Re nanotemplate exhibits higher activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction than Pt(111)."
[3] "Faceting is well-known to affect the chemical activity of a surface. Using Monte Carlo simulations, Persson et al. investigated the interplay between reactions occurring on adjacent facets of nanometer-sized supported catalyst particles."
