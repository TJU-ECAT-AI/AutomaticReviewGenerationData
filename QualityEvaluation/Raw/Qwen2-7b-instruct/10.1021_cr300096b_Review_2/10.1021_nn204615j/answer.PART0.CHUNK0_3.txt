<p>Faceting is well-known to affect the chemical activity of a surface.</p>
<p>Using Monte Carlo simulations, Persson et al. investigated the interplay between reactions occurring on adjacent facets of nanometer-sized supported catalyst particles.</p>
<p>These results indicate that the reaction kinetics on faceted nanocrystals can be remarkably different from those on single-crystal surfaces due to nontrivial coupling of the kinetics on the individual facets.</p>
<p>Earlier experimental studies of acetylene reactions on planar Pd/W(111) and faceted Pd/W(111) surfaces with varying facet sizes, as well as on a planar Pd/W(211) surface, revealed the important effects of geometric structure and finite size at the nanometer scale on reactions.</p>
<p>Notably, unlike the faceted W(111) surface induced by Pd, which consists of three-sided pyramidal facets having only {211} faces,</p>
<p>the Pt ML on faceted C/Re(1121) has facets with two different kinds of faces (two {0111} faces and one (1120) face).</p>
<p>The presence of two faces on the nanometer scale may make it more difficult to explain the effects on the HER due to kinetic competition and finite size effects.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to understand how the composition and arrangement of atoms affect the overall structure. DFT calculations can then be performed to predict the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The comprehensive understanding gained from this approach is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research, as it helps in designing materials with optimized catalytic activities and improved stability.
