[1] "We have now found that the presence of surface carbon on Re(1121), if followed by annealing in vacuum, causes faceting of Re(1121); that is, an initially planar Re(1121) surface becomes nanotextured to expose new crystal faces on the nanometer scale."
[2] "The Pt ML supported on the faceted C/Re nanotemplate exhibits higher activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction than Pt(111)."
[3] "A Pt ML supported on faceted C/Re(1121) has facets with two different kinds of faces (two {0111} faces and one (1120) face)."
[4] "Using the faceted C/Re(1121) substrate as a nanotemplate, we have successfully synthesized nanoscale model electrocatalysts composed of one monolayer of Pt supported on this surface."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to create bimetallic surfaces with precise control over the composition and arrangement of atoms. DFT calculations can then be performed on these surfaces to predict their electronic and chemical properties. This comprehensive understanding of the bimetallic surfaces is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research, as it helps in designing materials with optimized performance for various applications.
