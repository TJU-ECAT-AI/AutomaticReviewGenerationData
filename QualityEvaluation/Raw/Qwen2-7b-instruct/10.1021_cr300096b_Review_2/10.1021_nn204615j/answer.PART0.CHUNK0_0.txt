[1] "We have now found that the presence of surface carbon on Re(1121), if followed by annealing in vacuum, causes faceting of Re(1121); that is, an initially planar Re(1121) surface becomes nanotextured to expose new crystal faces on the nanometer scale."
[2] "The Pt ML supported on the faceted C/Re nanotemplate exhibits higher activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction than Pt(111)."
[3] "Faceting is well-known to affect the chemical activity of a surface. Using Monte Carlo simulations, Persson et al. investigated the interplay between reactions occurring on adjacent facets of nanometer-sized supported catalyst particles."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to understand the arrangement and interaction of Ni atoms on the Pt surface. DFT calculations can then be performed to simulate the electronic structure and chemical properties of the bimetallic system. This comprehensive understanding is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research, particularly in optimizing the activity and selectivity of Ni/Pt catalysts for various reactions.
