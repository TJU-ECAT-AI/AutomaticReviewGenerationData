The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows us to precisely control and analyze the composition, structure, and interactions at the interface between Ni and Pt. By synthesizing these bimetallic surfaces, researchers can investigate how the properties of each metal change when they are brought together, leading to insights into the enhanced functionalities that may arise from the synergistic effects of the two metals. This is particularly important in the development of catalysts, where the precise arrangement and interaction of metals can significantly impact catalytic activity and selectivity.
