The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves utilizing techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to monitor the surface structure. The presence and coverage of surface Pt are further characterized by low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The process is crucial because it allows for a detailed understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, which is essential for structural modeling and computational calculations. The enhanced activity of the Pt monolayer supported on the faceted C/Re(1121) surface for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrates the potential of using faceted metal surfaces as templates for synthesizing nanoscale model electrocatalysts with precise facet structures and controlled sizes, contributing to the advancement of surface science and catalysis research.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基体上沉积Ni单层，采用低能电子衍射（LEED）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）监测表面结构。通过低能离子散射（LEIS）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）进一步表征表面Pt的存在和覆盖情况。这一过程至关重要，因为它允许对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行详细理解，这对于结构建模和计算性研究至关重要。Pt单层支持在C/Re(1121)表面的增强活性为氢进化反应（HER）表明，使用具有精确面结构和可控尺寸的抛光金属表面作为合成纳米尺度模型电催化剂的模板具有潜力，这为表面科学和催化研究的进步做出了贡献。
