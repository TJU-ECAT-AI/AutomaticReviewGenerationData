1. Ultrathin Pd and Pt films can be grown on W substrates without causing substantial strain.
2. The DFT calculations permit us to propose the most energetically favorable structures.
3. The computational outcomes do not rule out the presence of dilute alloys that are not characterized by the 1-to-1 structure.
4. Allowing lateral motion reduces the energy difference between the most favorable alloy and the elemental film by 0.04 eV per surface unit cell, resulting in an energy difference of 0.18 eV per surface unit cell when compared to 0.14 eV per surface unit cell without lateral motion.

This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The energy differences between elemental and alloy films are determined through first-principles plane-wave DFT calculations based on the generalized gradient approximation. By systematically exchanging the top W atom with a Pt or Pd film atom and allowing the atomic positions to relax locally, the energy difference curves are obtained. This helps in identifying stable configurations and the onset of alloy formation. Considering structures not restricted to the pseudomorphic structure provides insights into the stability of the bimetallic surfaces. The 1.5 PML coverage for both Pt and Pd is noted to be stable against mixing, with all alloys having higher energy than the elemental film. Testing the possibility of lateral motion in the Pd 3 PML film confirms that there is no detectable motion in the direction across the rows, indicating the stability of the pseudomorphic structure.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够理解这些表面的电子和化学性质。通过基于广义梯度近似的原位原理平面波DFT计算确定元素薄膜和合金薄膜之间的能量差异。通过系统地交换顶部W原子与Pt或Pd薄膜原子，并允许垂直方向上的原子位置局部放松，可以获得能量差曲线图。这有助于识别稳定配置以及合金形成的发生。考虑不局限于拟晶结构的结构提供了关于双金属表面稳定性的见解。对于1.5 PML覆盖的Pt和Pd，注意到混合是稳定的，所有合金的能量高于元素薄膜。测试Pd 3 PML薄膜中是否存在横向运动的可能性证实了在跨行方向上没有可检测的运动，表明拟晶结构的稳定性。
