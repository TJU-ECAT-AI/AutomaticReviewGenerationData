[1] "Both to confirm the formation of alloy from theory and to help characterize the alloy, we present studies of Pd and Pt films with included W atoms. The DFT calculations allow us to suggest the energetically preferred structures."
[2] "The most direct way of finding the geometrical structure of a material by DFT calculations is to calculate the difference in system energy of all viable geometrical structures."
[3] "We further note that the 1.5 PML coverage both for Pt and Pd is stable against mixingall alloys considered here have larger energy than the elemental film."
[4] "For the 3 PML Pd film we have also considered structures not restricted to the pseudomorphic structure."
[5] "Our theory results, however, do not exclude dilute alloys not described by the 1=1 structure."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through the synthesis of a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By studying the energy differences between various structures, including those not restricted to the pseudomorphic structure, scientists can determine the energetically preferred configurations and gain insights into the stability of the alloys formed. The DFT calculations enable a deeper understanding of the interactions between Ni and Pt atoms, facilitating the prediction of the behavior of these bimetallic surfaces under different conditions.
