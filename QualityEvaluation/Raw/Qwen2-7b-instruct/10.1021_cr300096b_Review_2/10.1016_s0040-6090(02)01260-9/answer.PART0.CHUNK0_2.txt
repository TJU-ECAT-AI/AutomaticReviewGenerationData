[1] "Both to confirm the formation of alloy from theory and to help characterize the alloy, we present studies of Pd and Pt films with included W atoms."
[2] "The DFT calculations allow us to suggest the energetically preferred structures."
[3] "Our theory results, however, do not exclude dilute alloys not described by the 1=1 structure."
[4] "The theoretical onset of alloy formation as a function of coverage differs for the Pt and Pd films."
[5] "Compared to the W bulk structure, however, the overall contraction of the film is only 0.10.4 A."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through the deposition of a Ni monolayer on either Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it enables researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces comprehensively. It aids in predicting their behavior in advanced surface science and catalysis research, providing insights into their stability, reactivity, and potential applications.
