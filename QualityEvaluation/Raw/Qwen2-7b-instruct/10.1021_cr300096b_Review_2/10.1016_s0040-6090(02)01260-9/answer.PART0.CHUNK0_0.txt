[1] "The experimental methods used for preparation and characterization of the Pt and Pd films are described in w3,9x."
[2] "In this paper, the emphasis is on comparison of the experimental results for the Pt and Pd films with theory calculations, and the experimental results of relevance for this comparison are summarized below."
[3] "There is clear evidence from low-energy ion scattering and SXPS experiments for Pd films w3,10x, and from SXPS experiments for Pt films w3x, that no W atoms are exposed on the surface of multilayer alloy films, not even when W atoms are present in the bulk of the film."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and comprehending the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces within the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The experimental methods for preparation and characterization of the Pt and Pd films are detailed in the referenced literature. Low-energy ion scattering and SXPS experiments provide evidence that no W atoms are exposed on the surface of multilayer alloy films, even when W atoms are present within the bulk of the film.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征方法包括在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及深入理解这些表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质至关重要。文中详细描述了用于制备和表征Pt和Pd薄膜的实验方法。低能离子散射和SXPS实验提供了证据，表明即使基体中存在W原子，多层合金薄膜的表面也不会暴露W原子。
