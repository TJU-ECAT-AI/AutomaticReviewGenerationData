Relevant Answers:

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) are used to provide detailed information about the surface composition, structure, and electronic properties. The use of an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber ensures that the characterization is performed under ideal conditions. The phase of LEED in the experimental conditions is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n for the incident electron energy of 88 eV), making it sensitive to the surface step density and oscillating in a layer-by-layer growth manner. The intensity of the LEED satellites increases gradually as the coverage increases, indicating the formation of additional layers on the surface. The separation in k-space of the nth order of the fine structure from the original integer beam is described by a misfit vector, which helps quantify the structural distortion. Beyond a coverage of 3 ML, a three-dimensional island growth mode is observed, indicating the formation of nanostructures on the surface. The growth of Co/Pt superlattices on epitaxial Ag films on GaAs substrates has been studied using X-ray photoelectron diffraction, providing insights into the growth mechanism and properties of these superlattices. The Fermi edge shifts 0.2 eV to the higher binding energy as the coverage reaches 3.6 ML, indicating a change in the electronic structure of the surface. The density of electronic states of the system shows interesting changes during deposition, which are attributed to the transition from an atomic to a solid-state structure at the interface.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征包括在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。使用了Auger电子谱（AES）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和紫外光电子谱（UPS）等技术来提供关于表面组成、结构和电子性质的详细信息。使用了超高真空（UHV）室确保了在理想条件下进行表征。实验条件下的LEED相为(a(O,O)=Akxh=3n，电子能量为88 eV)，使其对表面台阶密度敏感，并以层状生长方式振荡。随着覆盖度的增加，LEED卫星强度逐渐增加，表示表面正在形成额外的层。k空间中第n阶精细结构与原始整数束之间的分离由错配向量描述，有助于量化结构畸变。覆盖度超过3 ML时，观察到三维岛生长模式，表示表面形成了纳米结构。Co/Pt超晶格在GaAs基片上的Epitaxial Ag薄膜上的生长已被X射线光电子衍射研究，提供了关于这些超晶格生长机制和性质的见解。当覆盖度达到3.6 ML时，费米边沿向更高的结合能移动0.2 eV，表明表面电子结构的变化。系统中的电子密度在沉积过程中显示出有趣的变化，这些变化归因于界面从原子态到固体状态的转变。
