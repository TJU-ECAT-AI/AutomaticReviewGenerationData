The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The base pressure is maintained at better than 3 x 10^-9 Torr. An electron energy analyzer from VG MICROTECH, specifically the CLAM-2 hemispherical analyzer, is utilized for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis. Prior to sputtering, the sample is heated at 880 K in an oxygen environment at a pressure of 5 x 10^-7 Torr for approximately 3 minutes to remove residual carbon. The cleanliness of the surface is verified through AES measurements. The growth process of cobalt (Co) over the platinum (Pt) surface is observed to occur layer-by-layer, as confirmed by AES measurements calibrated by Thiele et al. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征方法是通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层，在超高真空条件下进行。基压保持在大于3×10^-9托。使用VG MICROTECH的CLAM-2球面电子能量分析仪作为AES和紫外线光电电子能谱分析的电子能量分析器。在溅射前，将样品在氧气环境中加热至880 K，压力为5×10^-7托，大约3分钟以去除残留碳。通过AES测量验证表面清洁度。根据Thiele等人的测量结果，通过AES测量校准计算的Auger电子的无弹平均路径长度，证实了Co在Pt表面的生长层状结构。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下深入了解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。
