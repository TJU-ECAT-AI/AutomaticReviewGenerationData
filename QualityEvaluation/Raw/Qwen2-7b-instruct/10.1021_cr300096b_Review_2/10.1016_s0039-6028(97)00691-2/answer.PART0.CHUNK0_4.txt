1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

2. The characterization utilizes Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), four-grid video low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). These techniques provide detailed information about the surface composition, structure, and electronic properties of the bimetallic surfaces.

3. The process involves using an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber equipped with AES, four-grid video LEED, and UPS for the characterization. Detailed descriptions of the instrumentation and sample preparation are provided in previous studies.

4. The phase of LEED in the experimental conditions is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n for the incident electron energy of 88 eV. This phase is sensitive to the surface step density and can oscillate in a layer-by-layer growth.

5. The intensity of the LEED satellites increases gradually as the coverage increases, indicating the formation of additional layers on the surface.

6. The reciprocal lattice vectors apt = 2/aet and aco=2rc/aco are specific to the crystal structure of the substrate and the adsorbed atoms. They are used to describe the geometry of the LEED pattern.

7. The thickness of the Co overlayer is determined by the evolution of the Co 775 eV and Pt 237 eV Auger signals at room temperature.

8. After annealing 2 ML of Co on Pt(lll) at 650 K, the LEED satellite pattern rotates about its original integer beam, creating a new structure.

12. The Fermi edge shifts 0.2 eV to the higher binding energy as the coverage reaches 3.6 ML, indicating a change in the electronic structure of the surface.

13. The density of electronic states of the system shows interesting changes during deposition, which are attributed to the transition from an atomic to a solid-state structure at the interface.
