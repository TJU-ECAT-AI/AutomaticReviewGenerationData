The base pressure was better than 3 x 10^-10 Torr. The residual gases were checked using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The UHV chamber was also equipped for AES, four-grid video LEED and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).

A Co coil 0.5 mm in diameter and of 99.997% purity was used to evaporate cobalt atoms. The background pressure was about 1 x 10^-10 Torr during Co evaporation. Co was evaporated with a slow rate about 1 monolayer (ML) in 840 s. The instrumentation and sample preparation processes of this experiment are described in detail elsewhere [11,12].

We doubly checked the thickness of the Co overlayer by the evolutions of the Co 775 eV and Pt 237 eV Auger signals at room temperature. The AS-t plot, or Auger uptake curve, is shown in Fig. 2. The Auger intensity of Co 775 eV increases linearly while the intensity of Pt 237 eV Auger signal decreases linearly at the beginning.

The phase of LEED inour experimental conditions is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n for the incident electron energy of 88 eV. Where Ak is the momentum transfer perpendicular to the surface and h = 2.05 is the step height of the adsorbed Co atoms. It is an out-of-phase condition of diffraction which is more sensitive to the surface step density and can oscillate in a layer-by-layer growth [13].

In fact, the growth of Co/Pt superlattices on epitaxial Ag films on GaAs substrates has been studied by X-ray photoelectron diffraction. The author concluded that the Co film had mixed with Pt during growth at 373 K [16].

A series of LEED patterns were observed at different Co coverages at room temperature. These patterns can be clearly visible as the incident energy of electrons is higher than 56 eV. The well-ordered hexagonal LEED pattern of the clean Pt(111) surface shows that the surface is threefold symmetric.

A hard sphere model, based on the wave vector of the superstructure, has been used to study the Pb/Ag(111) system [21]. To confirm that the reorientation angle is equal to 4.9 for this system, we used the hard sphere model to calculate the mismatch for Co(0001) lattice points on the Pt(lll) surface at different angles in a real space•

We also used LEED to study the growth of this system at 140 K. The same fine structure was observed. These satellites are fuzzier with a stronger background than that of the deposition at room temperature at the coverage above 3 ML.

The structure of the valence band of this system in the growing process is interesting. The evolution of the angle integrated UP spectra during deposition at room temperature is shown in Fig. 7. He I resonance radiation with a photon energy of 21.2 eV was used. All UP spectra displayed in Fig. 7 were taken at the near-normal electron emission angle.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Key techniques employed include Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). AES checks for the thickness of the Ni overlayer by monitoring the evolution of Co 775 eV and Pt 237 eV Auger signals. LEED provides insights into the structural changes and growth modes of the bimetallic surface. The phase of LEED is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n) for the incident electron energy of 88 eV, making it sensitive to the surface step density and oscillating in a layer-by-layer growth manner. X-ray photoelectron diffraction studies on Co/Pt superlattices on epitaxial Ag films on GaAs substrates indicate mixing of Co and Pt during growth at 373 K. The LEED patterns observed at different Ni coverages at room temperature reveal the threefold symmetric nature of the Pt(111) surface. The hard sphere model, based on the wave vector of the superstructure, helps confirm the reorientation angle of 4.9 degrees for the system. At 140 K, the same fine structure is observed in the LEED patterns, though they exhibit fuzziness and a stronger background compared to room temperature deposition. The evolution of the valence band structure during deposition, as depicted by angle-integrated UPS spectra, provides valuable information about the changes in electronic properties from the atomic state to the solid state of Ni at the interface of Ni/Pt surfaces.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。关键的技术包括Auger电子能谱（AES）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和紫外光电子能谱（UPS）。通过监测Co 775 eV和Pt 237 eV Auger信号的变化，AES检查Ni覆盖层的厚度。LEED提供了关于双金属表面结构变化和生长模式的见解。LEED相位为（a(O,O)=Akxh=3n），适用于88 eV的入射电子能量，使其对表面台阶密度敏感，并以层状生长方式振荡。在373 K时，X射线光电子衍射研究表明，Co和Pt在Ni/Pt超晶格上生长时发生混合。在不同Ni覆盖度下的室温LEED图案揭示了Pt(111)表面的三重对称性。基于超结构波矢的硬球模型有助于确认该系统的旋转角度为4.9度。在140 K下，观察到相同的细结构LEED图案，但它们的模糊性和背景更强，与室温沉积相比。沉积过程中值带结构的变化，如角度积分UPS谱所示，提供了从原子状态到Ni在Ni/Pt界面的固体状态的电子属性变化的重要信息。
