The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves experiments conducted in a stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with a base pressure better than 3 x 10^- Torr. The electron energy analyzer used for Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was the CLAM-2 hemispherical analyzer from VG MICROTECH. Cobalt atoms were evaporated from a 0.5 mm diameter, 99.997% pure coil. The instrumentation and sample preparation processes were detailed elsewhere in the literature. Four-grid video low energy electron diffraction (LEED) was utilized to scan the peak-height intensity of a diffracted spot as a function of deposition time. The phase of LEED in the experimental conditions was (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n for an incident electron energy of 88 eV. As the coverage increased, the intensity of the satellites increased gradually, and higher order satellites developed. The separation in k-space of the nth order of the fine structure from the original integer beam could be described by a misfit vector. The rotated domains had two equivalent angles of rotation, + 4.9 and -4.9 degrees, with respect to the substrate. The Co adlayer arranged itself with a row of 15 Co adatoms accumulating on the r-axis with 0=4.9 degrees, containing 14 Pt hollow sites along [-1,1,0] plus another one of the nearest-neighbor row. At 140 K, the LEED patterns were observed to be the same as at room temperature, but a faint (2 x 2) LEED pattern was seen for higher coverages. Insufficient diffusion at this low temperature led to a rougher morphology of the ultrathin film compared to room temperature growth. An additional (2 x 2) LEED pattern was observed when the coverage exceeded 4.5 ML, persisting until the coverage was over 7 ML. The Fermi edge shifted 0.2 eV to a higher binding energy when the coverage reached 3.6 ML. Most of the changes in the density of electronic states were attributed to the transition from a Co atomic state to a Co solid state at the interface.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在不锈钢超高真空（UHV）室中进行的实验，基压高于3 x 10^-托耳。用于原子发射光谱（AES）和紫外光电电子能谱（UPS）的电子能量分析仪是VG MICROTECH的CLAM-2半球分析仪。从直径为0.5毫米、纯度为99.997%的线圈蒸发钴原子。文献中详细描述了仪器和样品制备过程。四网格视频低能电子衍射（LEED）被用来扫描衍射斑点的峰值高度强度作为沉积时间的函数。实验条件下的LEED相位为（a(O,O)=Akxh=3n，对于入射电子能量为88 eV。随着覆盖率的增加，卫星的强度逐渐增加，更高顺序的卫星发展。在k空间中，第n个细结构与原始整数束之间的分离可以用失配向量来描述。旋转区域具有+4.9°和-4.9°的等效旋转角度，相对于晶格面。Co吸附层排列在r轴上，以0=4.9°积聚15个Co吸附原子，包含14个沿[-1,1,0]的Pt空位点，以及另一个最近邻行上的一个。在140 K下，观察到的LEED模式与室温下的模式相同，但当覆盖度更高时，会出现微弱的（2 x 2）LEED模式。低温下不足的扩散导致超薄薄膜的形态比室温生长的更粗糙。当覆盖度超过4.5 ML时，观察到一个额外的（2 x 2）LEED模式，直到覆盖度超过7 ML才消失。费米边向更高的结合能偏移0.2 eV，当覆盖度达到3.6 ML时。电子密度的变化大多归因于界面处Co原子态向Co固体态的转变。
