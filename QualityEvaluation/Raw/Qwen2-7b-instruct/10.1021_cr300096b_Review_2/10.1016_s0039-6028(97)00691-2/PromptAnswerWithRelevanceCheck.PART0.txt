2.4 ML of Co on the Pt(111) surface shows incoherent epitaxy at room temperature.
Unrotated and rotated incommensurate Co domains of the top layer with two equivalent angles of rotation, +4.9  and -4.9  with respect to the aligned substrate, are observed by LEED for 2 ML of Co/Pt( 111 ) after applying an annealing treatment at 650 K.
The reorientation angle of 4.9  is confirmed from calculation of mismatch and the grade of buckling.
The Co adlayer arranges with a row of 15 Co adatoms accumulating on a row of 14 Pt hollow sites along [-1,1,0] plus another one on the nearest-neighbor row.
The rotated domains are caused by the thermal activation and the corresponding LEED pattern will disappear after the alloy state is complete.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy allows for precise determination of coverage and study of the initial growth phases. The observed unrotated and rotated incommensurate Co domains, with a reorientation angle of 4.9 degrees, indicate the complex structure of the interface. The confirmation of this reorientation angle through the calculation of mismatch and the grade of buckling provides insights into the thermal activation mechanism behind the formation of these domains. The detailed analysis of the LEED patterns, along with the observation of a faint (2x2) LEED pattern at higher coverages, and the evolution of the density of electronic states during deposition, contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the surface properties and their implications in catalytic applications.

The base pressure was better than 3 x 10^-10 Torr. The residual gases were checked using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The UHV chamber was also equipped for AES, four-grid video LEED and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS).

A Co coil 0.5 mm in diameter and of 99.997% purity was used to evaporate cobalt atoms. The background pressure was about 1 x 10^-10 Torr during Co evaporation. Co was evaporated with a slow rate about 1 monolayer (ML) in 840 s. The instrumentation and sample preparation processes of this experiment are described in detail elsewhere [11,12].

We doubly checked the thickness of the Co overlayer by the evolutions of the Co 775 eV and Pt 237 eV Auger signals at room temperature. The AS-t plot, or Auger uptake curve, is shown in Fig. 2. The Auger intensity of Co 775 eV increases linearly while the intensity of Pt 237 eV Auger signal decreases linearly at the beginning.

The phase of LEED inour experimental conditions is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n for the incident electron energy of 88 eV. Where Ak is the momentum transfer perpendicular to the surface and h = 2.05 is the step height of the adsorbed Co atoms. It is an out-of-phase condition of diffraction which is more sensitive to the surface step density and can oscillate in a layer-by-layer growth [13].

In fact, the growth of Co/Pt superlattices on epitaxial Ag films on GaAs substrates has been studied by X-ray photoelectron diffraction. The author concluded that the Co film had mixed with Pt during growth at 373 K [16].

A series of LEED patterns were observed at different Co coverages at room temperature. These patterns can be clearly visible as the incident energy of electrons is higher than 56 eV. The well-ordered hexagonal LEED pattern of the clean Pt(111) surface shows that the surface is threefold symmetric.

A hard sphere model, based on the wave vector of the superstructure, has been used to study the Pb/Ag(111) system [21]. To confirm that the reorientation angle is equal to 4.9 for this system, we used the hard sphere model to calculate the mismatch for Co(0001) lattice points on the Pt(lll) surface at different angles in a real space•

We also used LEED to study the growth of this system at 140 K. The same fine structure was observed. These satellites are fuzzier with a stronger background than that of the deposition at room temperature at the coverage above 3 ML.

The structure of the valence band of this system in the growing process is interesting. The evolution of the angle integrated UP spectra during deposition at room temperature is shown in Fig. 7. He I resonance radiation with a photon energy of 21.2 eV was used. All UP spectra displayed in Fig. 7 were taken at the near-normal electron emission angle.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Key techniques employed include Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). AES checks for the thickness of the Ni overlayer by monitoring the evolution of Co 775 eV and Pt 237 eV Auger signals. LEED provides insights into the structural changes and growth modes of the bimetallic surface. The phase of LEED is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n) for the incident electron energy of 88 eV, making it sensitive to the surface step density and oscillating in a layer-by-layer growth manner. X-ray photoelectron diffraction studies on Co/Pt superlattices on epitaxial Ag films on GaAs substrates indicate mixing of Co and Pt during growth at 373 K. The LEED patterns observed at different Ni coverages at room temperature reveal the threefold symmetric nature of the Pt(111) surface. The hard sphere model, based on the wave vector of the superstructure, helps confirm the reorientation angle of 4.9 degrees for the system. At 140 K, the same fine structure is observed in the LEED patterns, though they exhibit fuzziness and a stronger background compared to room temperature deposition. The evolution of the valence band structure during deposition, as depicted by angle-integrated UPS spectra, provides valuable information about the changes in electronic properties from the atomic state to the solid state of Ni at the interface of Ni/Pt surfaces.
