2.4 ML of Co on the Pt(111) surface shows incoherent epitaxy at room temperature.
Unrotated and rotated incommensurate Co domains of the top layer with two equivalent angles of rotation, +4.9  and -4.9  with respect to the aligned substrate, are observed by LEED for 2 ML of Co/Pt( 111 ) after applying an annealing treatment at 650 K.
The reorientation angle of 4.9  is confirmed from calculation of mismatch and the grade of buckling.
The Co adlayer arranges with a row of 15 Co adatoms accumulating on a row of 14 Pt hollow sites along [-1,1,0] plus another one on the nearest-neighbor row.
The rotated domains are caused by the thermal activation and the corresponding LEED pattern will disappear after the alloy state is complete.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and Auger electron spectroscopy allows for precise determination of coverage and study of the initial growth phases. The observed unrotated and rotated incommensurate Co domains, with a reorientation angle of 4.9 degrees, indicate the complex structure of the interface. The confirmation of this reorientation angle through the calculation of mismatch and the grade of buckling provides insights into the thermal activation mechanism behind the formation of these domains. The detailed analysis of the LEED patterns, along with the observation of a faint (2x2) LEED pattern at higher coverages, and the evolution of the density of electronic states during deposition, contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the surface properties and their implications in catalytic applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。使用低能电子衍射（LEED）和俄歇电子谱学能够精确地确定覆盖度并研究初始生长阶段。通过观察顶部层的无旋转和旋转不相关Co域，以及相对于对齐的基底具有两个等效旋转角度+4.9°和-4.9°，可以深入了解界面的复杂结构。通过计算失配和弯曲的程度确认了这个旋转角度，提供了热激活机制形成这些区域的见解。通过分析LEED模式，观察到较高覆盖度下的微弱（2x2）LEED模式，以及在沉积过程中电子密度状态的变化，为表面属性及其在催化应用中的影响提供全面的理解。
