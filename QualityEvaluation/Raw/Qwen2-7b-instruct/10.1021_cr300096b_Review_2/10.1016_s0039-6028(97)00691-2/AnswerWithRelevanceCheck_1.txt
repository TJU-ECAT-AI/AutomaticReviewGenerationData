Questions:

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

Answers:

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. Key techniques employed include Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). AES checks for the thickness of the Ni overlayer by monitoring the evolution of Co 775 eV and Pt 237 eV Auger signals. LEED provides insights into the structural changes and growth modes of the bimetallic surface. The phase of LEED is (a(O,O)=Akxh=3n) for the incident electron energy of 88 eV, making it sensitive to the surface step density and oscillating in a layer-by-layer growth manner. X-ray photoelectron diffraction studies on Co/Pt superlattices on epitaxial Ag films on GaAs substrates indicate mixing of Co and Pt during growth at 373 K. The LEED patterns observed at different Ni coverages at room temperature reveal the threefold symmetric nature of the Pt(111) surface. The hard sphere model, based on the wave vector of the superstructure, helps confirm the reorientation angle of 4.9 degrees for the system. At 140 K, the same fine structure is observed in the LEED patterns, though they exhibit fuzziness and a stronger background compared to room temperature deposition. The evolution of the valence band structure during deposition, as depicted by angle-integrated UPS spectra, provides valuable information about the changes in electronic properties from the atomic state to the solid state of Ni at the interface of Ni/Pt surfaces.

Chinese Version Answer:
Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。关键技术包括Auger电子谱（AES）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和紫外光电子谱（UPS）。通过监测Co 775 eV和Pt 237 eV Auger信号的变化，AES检查Ni覆盖层的厚度。LEED提供了关于双金属表面结构变化和生长模式的见解。LEED相为（a(O,O)=Akxh=3n，对于入射电子能量为88 eV），使其对表面台阶密度敏感，并以层状生长方式振荡。在373 K时，X射线光电子衍射研究表明，Co和Pt在Ni/Pt超晶格上生长时发生混合。在室温下不同Ni覆盖度下的LEED图案揭示了Pt(111)表面的三重对称性。基于超结构波矢的硬球模型帮助确认系统旋转角度为4.9度。在140 K下，观察到相同的细结构LEED图案，尽管它们的模糊性和背景比室温沉积时更强。沉积过程中值带结构的变化，如角度集成UPS谱所示，提供了从原子状态到Ni在Ni/Pt界面的固体状态的电子属性变化的重要信息。
