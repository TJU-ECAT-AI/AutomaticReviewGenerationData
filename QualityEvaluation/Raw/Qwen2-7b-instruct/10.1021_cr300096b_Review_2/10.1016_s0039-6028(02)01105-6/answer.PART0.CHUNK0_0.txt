The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves utilizing a series of analytical techniques. These include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The ultrahigh vacuum chamber used for preparation ensures minimal contamination. The deposition process at 350 K allows for monitoring the interaction and alloying of Ni with Pt through changes in core level intensities of Fe and Pt using XPS. The formation of a (2×2) LEED pattern at certain temperatures provides insight into the ordered state of the alloyed surface. XPS measurements of the Fe(3d) peak during annealing offer information on the stability of the alloy and the distribution of elements within the surface layer. These methods collectively contribute to a detailed understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, crucial for their application in catalysis research and structural modeling.
