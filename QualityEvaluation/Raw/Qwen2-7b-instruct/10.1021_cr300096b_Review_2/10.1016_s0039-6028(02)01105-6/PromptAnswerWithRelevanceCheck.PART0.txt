The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves utilizing a series of analytical techniques. These include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), low-energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The ultrahigh vacuum chamber used for preparation ensures minimal contamination. The deposition process at 350 K allows for monitoring the interaction and alloying of Ni with Pt through changes in core level intensities of Fe and Pt using XPS. The formation of a (2×2) LEED pattern at certain temperatures provides insight into the ordered state of the alloyed surface. XPS measurements of the Fe(3d) peak during annealing offer information on the stability of the alloy and the distribution of elements within the surface layer. These methods collectively contribute to a detailed understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, crucial for their application in catalysis research and structural modeling.

<p>The thermal stability of these Fe films and the concentration of Fe in the topmost layer was characterized by X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy ion scattering (LEIS).</p>
<p>LEIS was used to determine the surface Fe coverage according to (1) where IFe and IPt are LEIS intensities (peak heights) measured for the surface under examination, and IFe and IPt are the intensities measured for a thick Fe film and a clean Pt(1 1 1) surface, respectively.</p>
<p>The deposition of the Fe film on Pt(1 1 1) at 350 K was monitored routinely with XPS by using the Fe(3d) and Pt(4f) core level intensities (peak areas).</p>
<p>Fig. 1. He+ LEIS data for Fe deposition on a Pt(1 1 1) surface at 350 K. The Pt and Fe signals, along with the Fe/Pt ratio are shown, as deduced from the peak heights.</p>
<p>Fig. 2. Studies of the influence of annealing on a 1.5-DU Fe film on Pt(1 1 1): (a) He+ LEIS and (b) Fe(3d5/2) core level in XPS. The annealing time was 20 s at each temperature.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 shows results for the Pt(4f) core levels. The clean Pt(1 1 1) surface gave a Pt(4f7/2) core-level peak at 71.0 eV BE with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 1.50 eV. Following deposition of Fe, this peak could be decomposed into two peaks at 71.0 and 71.4 eV BE, as depicted by the dashed lines, assuming a constant line width and line shape.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows that the Fe(3d5/2) core-level peak following deposition of 0.4 or 1-DU Fe on Pt(1 1 1) at 350 K, in curves (a) and (b), occurs near 707.8 eV BE. This can be compared to the peak after deposition of a 3-DU Fe film on Pt(1 1 1), in curve (d), which is assigned to be due primarily to a peak at 706.8 eV BE that arises from unalloyed, metallic Fe.</p>
<p>During the annealing experiments shown in Fig. 2 , we also examined the surface with LEED after each annealing step.</p>
<p>In summary, we show evidence that PtFe alloy surfaces that expose Fe in the first layer can be prepared by annealing Fe films deposited onto a Pt(1 1 1) surface.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves annealing the deposited Ni monolayer to stabilize the Ni/Pt alloy surfaces. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By annealing the Ni monolayer, researchers can achieve a more thermally stable surface composition, with significant amounts of Ni stabilized in the surface layer until high temperatures of up to 950 K. This method allows for the preparation of Fe-containing alloy surfaces on a Pt(1 1 1) surface that exhibit enhanced thermal stability against Pt surface segregation compared to bulk crystals of Pt80Fe20(1 1 1), offering insights into the structural and catalytic properties of these surfaces.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is conducted through various analytical techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). These techniques are crucial for understanding the structural and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. The XPS provides information on the chemical state and composition of elements on the surface, while LEIS measures the elemental coverage and depth profile, helping to identify the surface alloy composition. AES offers additional information on surface contamination and composition. LEED patterns provide insights into the surface structure and ordering, which is essential for modeling and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
