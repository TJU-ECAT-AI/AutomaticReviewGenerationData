<p>The thermal stability of these Fe films and the concentration of Fe in the topmost layer was characterized by X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy ion scattering (LEIS).</p>
<p>LEIS was used to determine the surface Fe coverage according to (1) where IFe and IPt are LEIS intensities (peak heights) measured for the surface under examination, and IFe and IPt are the intensities measured for a thick Fe film and a clean Pt(1 1 1) surface, respectively.</p>
<p>The deposition of the Fe film on Pt(1 1 1) at 350 K was monitored routinely with XPS by using the Fe(3d) and Pt(4f) core level intensities (peak areas).</p>
<p>Fig. 1. He+ LEIS data for Fe deposition on a Pt(1 1 1) surface at 350 K. The Pt and Fe signals, along with the Fe/Pt ratio are shown, as deduced from the peak heights.</p>
<p>Fig. 2. Studies of the influence of annealing on a 1.5-DU Fe film on Pt(1 1 1): (a) He+ LEIS and (b) Fe(3d5/2) core level in XPS. The annealing time was 20 s at each temperature.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 shows results for the Pt(4f) core levels. The clean Pt(1 1 1) surface gave a Pt(4f7/2) core-level peak at 71.0 eV BE with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 1.50 eV. Following deposition of Fe, this peak could be decomposed into two peaks at 71.0 and 71.4 eV BE, as depicted by the dashed lines, assuming a constant line width and line shape.</p>
<p>Fig. 4 shows that the Fe(3d5/2) core-level peak following deposition of 0.4 or 1-DU Fe on Pt(1 1 1) at 350 K, in curves (a) and (b), occurs near 707.8 eV BE. This can be compared to the peak after deposition of a 3-DU Fe film on Pt(1 1 1), in curve (d), which is assigned to be due primarily to a peak at 706.8 eV BE that arises from unalloyed, metallic Fe.</p>
<p>During the annealing experiments shown in Fig. 2 , we also examined the surface with LEED after each annealing step.</p>
<p>In summary, we show evidence that PtFe alloy surfaces that expose Fe in the first layer can be prepared by annealing Fe films deposited onto a Pt(1 1 1) surface.</p>

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is conducted through the use of X-ray electron spectroscopy (XPS) and low energy ion scattering (LEIS). This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
