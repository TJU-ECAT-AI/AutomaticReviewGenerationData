<p>The deposition of Fe on Pt(1 1 1) at 350 K was followed by LEIS and the data is shown in Fig. 1. The Pt and Fe signals, along with the Fe/Pt ratio are shown, as deduced from the peak heights.</p>

<p>We also performed XPS measurements of the Fe(3d) peak, following the intensity during the above annealing sequence, and these results are shown in Fig. 2 b. Since the mean free path of these electrons is more that 10 Å, this data is sensitive to the changes in the composition of the near-surface region, and this provides additional information.</p>

<p>Fig. 3 shows results for the Pt(4f) core levels. The clean Pt(1 1 1) surface gave a Pt(4f7/2) core-level peak at 71.0 eV BE with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 1.50 eV. Following deposition of Fe, this peak could be decomposed into two peaks at 71.0 and 71.4 eV BE, as depicted by the dashed lines, assuming a constant line width and line shape.</p>

<p>Fig. 4 shows that the Fe(3d5/2) core-level peak following deposition of 0.4 or 1-DU Fe on Pt(1 1 1) at 350 K, in curves (a) and (b), occurs near 707.8 eV BE.</p>

<p>During the annealing experiments shown in Fig. 2, we also examined the surface with LEED after each annealing step. In the region from 750 to 850 K where the Fe signal did not change significantly, a diffuse (2×2) LEED pattern was observed as shown in Fig. 5.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is conducted through various analytical techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low energy ion scattering (LEIS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and low energy electron diffraction (LEED). These techniques are crucial for understanding the structural and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces. The XPS provides information on the chemical state and composition of elements on the surface, while LEIS measures the elemental coverage and depth profile, helping to identify the surface alloy composition. AES offers additional information on surface contamination and composition. LEED patterns provide insights into the surface structure and ordering, which is essential for modeling and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
