[1] "annealing a 1.5-DU Fe film causes a decrease in the concentration of Fe at the surface, as shown in Fig. 2."
[2] "the Fe concentration in the surface layer was nearly constant at 0.5 ML."
[3] "this procedure produces Fe-containing alloy surfaces that are more thermally stable against Pt surface segregation than expected from the behavior of Pt80Fe20(1 1 1) bulk crystals."
[4] "significant amounts of Fe are stabilized in the surface layer until temperatures as high as 950 K."
[5] "we show evidence that PtFe alloy surfaces that expose Fe in the first layer can be prepared by annealing Fe films deposited onto a Pt(1 1 1) surface."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves annealing the deposited Ni monolayer to stabilize the Ni/Pt alloy surfaces. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. By annealing the Ni monolayer, researchers can achieve a more thermally stable surface composition, with significant amounts of Ni stabilized in the surface layer until high temperatures of up to 950 K. This method allows for the preparation of Fe-containing alloy surfaces on a Pt(1 1 1) surface that exhibit enhanced thermal stability against Pt surface segregation compared to bulk crystals of Pt80Fe20(1 1 1), offering insights into the structural and catalytic properties of these surfaces.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层后进行退火，以稳定Ni/Pt合金表面。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及深入了解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质至关重要。通过退火沉积的Ni单层，研究人员可以实现更稳定的表面组成，并在高达950 K的温度下保持大量Ni稳定在表面层中。这种方法允许在Pt(1 1 1)表面上准备Fe含量合金表面，这些表面表现出比Pt80Fe20(1 1 1)块体晶体更高的热稳定性，对抗Pt表面扩散。这为了解这些表面的结构和催化性质提供了见解。
