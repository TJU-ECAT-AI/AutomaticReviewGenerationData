[1] "This work presents low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed CO data for Ru-modified Pt(100) surfaces in UHV prepared by a versatile method involving X-ray irradiation of Ru3(CO)12 layers condensed on cold Pt substrates followed by thermal annealing."
[2] "X-ray-irradiated, oxygen-annealed Ru3(CO)12/Pt(poly) surfaces were found to yield constant integrated Ru/Pt XPS peak ratios from ca. 350 K up to about 900 K (see Figure 4)."
[3] "On this basis, it seems likely that the unique effects induced by brief annealing of Ru(θRu = 0.42 ML)/Pt(100) to 900 K are due to atomic rearrangements on the surface, which may include formation of Ru islands on the reconstructed Pt(100)."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed CO. The process of depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. Thermal annealing at high temperatures, particularly around 900 K, leads to atomic rearrangements on the surface, potentially forming Ru islands that induce unique effects such as a downshift in the onset CO desorption temperature, which is critical for comprehending the catalytic behavior of these surfaces.
