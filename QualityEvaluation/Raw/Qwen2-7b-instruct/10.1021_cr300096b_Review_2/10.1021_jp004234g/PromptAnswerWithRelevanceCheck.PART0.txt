[1] "This work presents low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed CO data for Ru-modified Pt(100) surfaces in UHV prepared by a versatile method involving X-ray irradiation of Ru3(CO)12 layers condensed on cold Pt substrates followed by thermal annealing."
[2] "X-ray-irradiated, oxygen-annealed Ru3(CO)12/Pt(poly) surfaces were found to yield constant integrated Ru/Pt XPS peak ratios from ca. 350 K up to about 900 K (see Figure 4)."
[3] "On this basis, it seems likely that the unique effects induced by brief annealing of Ru(θRu = 0.42 ML)/Pt(100) to 900 K are due to atomic rearrangements on the surface, which may include formation of Ru islands on the reconstructed Pt(100)."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted through a combination of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of adsorbed CO. The process of depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. Thermal annealing at high temperatures, particularly around 900 K, leads to atomic rearrangements on the surface, potentially forming Ru islands that induce unique effects such as a downshift in the onset CO desorption temperature, which is critical for comprehending the catalytic behavior of these surfaces.

Answer: The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, typically involves using techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). These methods allow researchers to determine the stoichiometry, structure, and chemical state of the surfaces. The process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

B. Instrumentation. All measurements were performed in a two-level UHV chamber described in an earlier publication. 24 This system is equipped with rear-view LEED optics (PRI), a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (PHI, model 10-360), a dual (Mg/Al) anode X-ray source for XPS (PHI model 04-548), a 15 μm spot size 10 keV electron gun for AES, a sputter gun (PHI model 04-192), and a Dycor M200 M mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis and TPD. 

Results and Discussion
A. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Exposure of a clean Pt(poly) foil at 150 K to Ru3(CO)12 vapors for 30 min yielded XPS spectra recorded at that temperature, showing peaks attributed to Ru in a slightly oxidized state at ca. 282 (3d5/2) and 286 (3d3/2) eV, respectively (see curve a, upper panel, Figure 1) and features characteristic of metallic Pt (not shown here). 

A very different behavior was found for Ru3(CO)12/Pt surfaces condensed at 150 K for 30 min, and then irradiated with X-rays from the XPS source while the sample was slowly heated to higher temperatures. In particular, Ru3(CO)12/Pt(poly) surfaces allowed to warm to ca. 330 K following such treatment, displayed clearly defined XPS peaks ascribed to Ru(3d) and O(1s) (see curves b in the upper and lower panels, Figure 1), signaling decomposition of the Ru3(CO)12 to yield species with significantly lower vapor pressure.

Of particular significance is the fact that in the case of bimetallic Ru/Pt(100) surfaces prepared by the same condensation/X-ray irradiation method, no oxygen was found to be necessary during annealing at ca. 620 K, to obtain a clean, i.e., carbon and oxygen free, Ru overlayer, as evidenced by the Ru(3d) XPS spectra shown in Figure 2 (see Table 1).

Figure 2 Ru(3d) XPS spectra for a Pt(100) surface exposed to Ru3(CO)12 vapors for 10 min at 150 K and then irradiated with X-rays recorded after the specimen had been allowed to warm to room temperature and heated to 600 K for a few seconds. Solid lines represent best asymmetric fits using both Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The Ru coverage was estimated to be 0.91 ML.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The XPS analysis reveals the oxidation state of the deposited Ni and Ru species, while LEED patterns provide insights into the surface reconstruction and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. TPD of adsorbed CO allows for the examination of the stability and bonding characteristics of CO on the bimetallic surfaces, offering information on the catalytic activity and reactivity of the surfaces.

In the context of the literature provided, the XPS analysis of the Ru/Pt(100) bimetallic surfaces after exposure to Ru3(CO)12, X-ray irradiation, and annealing at ca. 620 K, shows that the oxygen necessary for cleaning the surface can be eliminated through annealing, resulting in a clean, carbon and oxygen-free Ru overlayer. This process is critical for preparing surfaces for further analysis and understanding their properties in catalytic applications.

根据提供的文献，在对100 Pt（100）双金属表面进行Ru3（CO）12暴露、X射线照射和在约620 K下退火后的XPS分析显示，通过退火可以去除用于清洁表面所需的氧气，从而形成清洁的、不含碳和氧的Ru覆盖层。这一过程对于准备用于进一步分析和理解其性质以应用于催化应用至关重要。
