B. Instrumentation. All measurements were performed in a two-level UHV chamber described in an earlier publication. 24 This system is equipped with rear-view LEED optics (PRI), a hemispherical electron energy analyzer (PHI, model 10-360), a dual (Mg/Al) anode X-ray source for XPS (PHI model 04-548), a 15 μm spot size 10 keV electron gun for AES, a sputter gun (PHI model 04-192), and a Dycor M200 M mass spectrometer for residual gas analysis and TPD. 

Results and Discussion
A. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Exposure of a clean Pt(poly) foil at 150 K to Ru3(CO)12 vapors for 30 min yielded XPS spectra recorded at that temperature, showing peaks attributed to Ru in a slightly oxidized state at ca. 282 (3d5/2) and 286 (3d3/2) eV, respectively (see curve a, upper panel, Figure 1) and features characteristic of metallic Pt (not shown here). 

A very different behavior was found for Ru3(CO)12/Pt surfaces condensed at 150 K for 30 min, and then irradiated with X-rays from the XPS source while the sample was slowly heated to higher temperatures. In particular, Ru3(CO)12/Pt(poly) surfaces allowed to warm to ca. 330 K following such treatment, displayed clearly defined XPS peaks ascribed to Ru(3d) and O(1s) (see curves b in the upper and lower panels, Figure 1), signaling decomposition of the Ru3(CO)12 to yield species with significantly lower vapor pressure.

Of particular significance is the fact that in the case of bimetallic Ru/Pt(100) surfaces prepared by the same condensation/X-ray irradiation method, no oxygen was found to be necessary during annealing at ca. 620 K, to obtain a clean, i.e., carbon and oxygen free, Ru overlayer, as evidenced by the Ru(3d) XPS spectra shown in Figure 2 (see Table 1).

Solid lines represent best asymmetric fits using both Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The Ru coverage was estimated to be 0.91 ML.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The XPS analysis reveals the oxidation state of the deposited Ni and Ru species, while LEED patterns provide insights into the surface reconstruction and structure of the bimetallic surfaces. TPD of adsorbed CO allows for the examination of the stability and bonding characteristics of CO on the bimetallic surfaces, offering information on the catalytic activity and reactivity of the surfaces.

In the context of the literature provided, the XPS analysis of the Ru/Pt(100) bimetallic surfaces after exposure to Ru3(CO)12, X-ray irradiation, and annealing at ca. 620 K, shows that the oxygen necessary for cleaning the surface can be eliminated through annealing, resulting in a clean, carbon and oxygen-free Ru overlayer. This process is critical for preparing surfaces for further analysis and understanding their properties in catalytic applications.

对于通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及X射线光电子能谱（XPS）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和温度程序脱附（TPD）。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。XPS分析揭示了沉积的Ni和Ru物种的氧化状态，而LEED图案提供了关于双金属表面重构和结构的见解。对吸附CO的TPD允许检查CO在双金属表面的稳定性及其与表面的结合特性，从而提供关于表面的催化活性和反应性的信息。

根据提供的文献，在对100 Pt（100）双金属表面进行Ru3（CO）12暴露、X射线照射和在约620 K下退火后的XPS分析显示，通过退火可以去除用于清洁表面所需的氧气，从而形成清洁的、不含碳和氧的Ru覆盖层。这一过程对于准备用于进一步分析和理解其性质以应用于催化应用至关重要。
