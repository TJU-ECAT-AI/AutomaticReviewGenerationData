3.1. Growth at 300-450 K
"After cleaning by a high-temperature flash, the sample mounting cooled slowly and Mo deposition was usually started with the Pt crystal at nearer 400 than 300 K."

3.2. Mo film growth at higher temperature
"When the substrate was held at 430 K during the deposition sequence, the electron reflectivity spectrum of the Mo-covered surface was the same as for growth at 300 K but the intensity reached a steady level."

3.3. Annealing behauiour
"No new surface structures detectable by LEED were seen when deposits of less than 3 monolayers of Mo were annealed at temperatures from 600 to 1100 K."

1. The Mo deposition typically began when the Pt crystal was at around 400 K, rather than 300 K, during the slow cooling process after high-temperature flash cleaning.
2. Depositing Mo on the Pt surface at 430 K resulted in a stable reflectivity spectrum, similar to that at 300 K, but with a constant intensity level.
3. Annealing Mo films with less than 3 monolayers did not reveal any new surface structures visible through LEED imaging when performed at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1100 K.

1. 在经过高温闪蒸清洗后，缓慢冷却过程中，钼沉积通常开始于铂晶片温度接近400K，而非300K。
2. 在430K下进行钼表面沉积时，所获得的电子反射谱与在300K下的相同，但强度达到了稳定的水平。
3. 当在600到1100K的温度范围内对少于3层的钼薄膜进行退火处理时，无法通过LEED成像检测到任何新的表面结构。
