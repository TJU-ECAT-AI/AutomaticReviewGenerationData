[1] "The restricted mobility of adatoms and small dusters of Mo on a Mo(ll0) surface at 300 K prevents regular layer-by-layer development of Mo films deposited on a Pt(lll) surface."
[2] "Deposition of Mo with the Pt substrate at 430 K produced a more ordered Mo film but growth at 600 K resulted in a different surface structure, presumably due to the increasing effects of Pt diffusion."
[3] "The microstructure of the surface region for a Mo-covered Pt(lll) surface evolves by diffusion of Mo into Pt at temperatures above 700 K and local phase equilibrium is approached."
[4] "Annealing deposits of less than three monolayers of Mo results in a steady loss of Mo from the surface without the separation of new phases. During the annealing of thicker films, the Mo concentration in the solid-solution alloy formed at the surface by Mo diffusion into Pt reaches the solubility limit and the orthorhombic ordered alloy phase Pt2Mo separates."
[5] "The ordered alloy is characterized by a distinctive electron reflectivity spectrum and a (v- × v-)R30 LEED pattern, indicating that it grows with the close-packed (101) alloy plane parallel to Pt(lll)."
[6] "The ordered alloy disappears when continuing diffusion of Mo into Pt causes the concentration of Mo in the solid solution phase to fall below the solubility limit."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it enables detailed analysis of the interaction between the two metals, their structural arrangements, and the resulting properties. By examining the surface properties through techniques such as electron reflectivity spectroscopy and LEED, researchers can gain insights into how the bimetallic surfaces behave under various conditions, which is essential for optimizing their performance in catalytic applications.
