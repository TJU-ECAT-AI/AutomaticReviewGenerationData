3.1. Growth at 300-450 K
After cleaning by a high-temperature flash, the sample mounting cooled slowly and Mo deposition was usually started with the Pt crystal at nearer 400 than 300 K. The amplitude of Pt and Mo Auger signals, electron reflectivity spectra and work function change were measured as a function of the number of Mo doses added. The Mo Auger signal amplitude usually grew linearly with the number of doses. Changes in the slope of Mo Auger signal/dose plots that could be interpreted as indicating mono-layer completion in layer-by-layer growth were seen occasionally but were not a regular feature of Mo film growth.

Electron reflection spectra changed substantially as a result of Mo deposition, Fig. 2. For the clean Pt(lll) surface, the spectrum for normal incidence of the incident beam shows a group of strong reflection peaks near 20 eV that provides a characteristic "fingerprint" of this surface. Following Jaklevic and Davis [16], this feature arises from the (222) Bragg reflection band gap in Pt with a narrow peak on the low-energy side associated with a gap at a band crossing. On adding Mo, the Pt features attenuated rapidly to a background level that decreased slowly with further Mo dosing and new peaks appeared at 8 and 18 eV. The intensity of the stronger 8 eV peak increased linearly with Mo dose, Fig. 3, with no slope changes that could be attributed to layer-by-layer growth. The features of the new reflectivity spectrum, including the relative intensity of the two peaks, closely match those of the spectrum for a clean Mo(ll0) surface obtained in our apparatus.

Mo deposition also changed the dependence of electron reflectivity on the angle of incidence of the electron beam. For the clean Pt(lll) surface at 23 eV for example, rotating the crystal about the [12] direction in the surface plane showed a sharp peak in reflectivity for normal incidence, with equally sharp and intense peaks when the beam was at 30 to the surface normal. The non-specular peaks are due to (01) and (11) diffraction beams and attain maximum intensity as these beams cross the rotation axis.

Deposition of Mo caused the non-specular peaks to decrease in intensity and to shift to 25, with the changes being substantially complete after adding 3 monolayers of Mo.

3.2. Mo film growth at higher temperature
Attempts were made to grow films with improved order by depositing Mo with the Pt crystal heated by radiation from a hot tungsten filament behind it.

When the substrate was held at 430 K during the deposition sequence, the electron reflectivity spectrum of the Mo-covered surface was the same as for growth at 300 K but the intensity reached a steady level. The spectrum was unchanged after briefly heating the Mo-covered crystal to 800 K and LEED showed a sharp pattern, which appeared to be that of a Mo(ll0) surface with additional satellite spots close to each Mo spot.

Growth at 600 K did not lead to any further improvement in ordering of the Mo overlayer but resulted in a surface with different structural features. The reflectivity spectrum developed differently, with the Pt surface peaks disappearing and being replaced by new spectral features similar to but less intense than those of annealed Mo-covered surfaces giving a sharp (vr3 - × f3-)R30 LEED pattern. Weak f3- features could be detected in the LEED pattern of the completed film. The Pt Auger signal for the completed film was much larger (X 5) compared to that for a room temperature Mo film of similar thickness. It is likely that increased mobility of both Mo and Pt during deposition at 600 K leads directly to surface structural changes similar to those caused by annealing films grown at 300 K.

3.3. Annealing behavior
Alloy formation resulting from solution of Mo in the Pt substrate provides a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed when Mo deposits were annealed at elevated temperature and the results are therefore described in these terms.

No new surface structures detectable by LEED were seen when deposits of less than 3 monolayers of Mo were annealed at temperatures from 600 to 1100 K. The Pt Auger signal increased while that for Mo decreased steadily towards zero, Fig. 4, indicating that the Mo diffused into the interior of the Pt substrate to form a substitutional solid-solution alloy.

No evidence of new surface structures was seen in the electron reflectance spectrum, which changed steadily towards that for clean Pt.

Annealing Mo deposits thicker than 3 monolayers above 700 K also caused the surface concentration of Mo to fall steadily during a sequence of annealing steps at increasing temperature, but at higher temperature than for the thinner films, Fig. 4. For these thicker films, however, the composition changes in the surface region were accompanied by formation of a new ordered phase. This was detectable first from changes in the electron reflectance spectrum and by LEED at a later stage.

LEED patterns showed additional diffuse spots corresponding to a (f3- × v-)R30 pattern after annealing at temperatures above 800 K, that became sharper and more intense as the surface concentration of Mo decreased during subsequent anneals at higher temperature. The LEED features were seen over a large range in Mo Auger signal, although the range of Pt signal was smaller, extending approximately from 30% up to 60% of the clean surface Pt signal. The V- diffraction beams weakened and disappeared as the Mo signal intensity approached and decreased below that of a monolayer film deposited at 300 K. The pattern was sharpest and most intense when the Mo signal was at a level approximately that for 2 monolayers of Mo deposited at 300 K, although the Pt/Mo signal ratio was significantly larger than for the 300 K Mo movedayer.

This result is consistent with the presence of an alloy phase at the surface but surface segregation of Pt and partial agglomeration of Mo or alloy, exposing some areas of Pt-rich surface, may also affect the Pt/Mo signal ratio. It is therefore not justifiable to deduce a value for the Pt/Mo composition ratio for the ordered surface phase from the Auger signal intensities without more information about the morphology of the surface region.

4. Discussion
The linear growth of both Mo Auger and electron reflectivity signals with Mo dose clearly does not support a simple layer-by-layer model for the growth of Mo films on Pt (111) at 300 K. Unfortunately, the absence of sharp breaks in the Auger signal/Mo dose plots makes it difficult to evaluate Mo coverages. Assigning the break in the work function versus dose plot, Fig. 1, to completion of the first Mo monolayer gives a coverage scale that is consistent with the attenuation rate of the Pt Auger signal. It then follows that the Pt substrate contribution to electron reflection at 23 eV attenuates more rapidly than the 64 eV Auger signal, with the prominent features being almost obliterated by the first Mo monolayer. Such rapid attenuation emphasizes the high surface sensitivity of reflectivity spectra, which was also seen in the degradation of spectra following overnight contamination of the surface by adsorbed gases.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a series of experimental techniques. These include Auger electron spectroscopy, Auger electron spectra, low-energy electron reflectivity spectra, work function measurements, and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) analysis. The process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. 

In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, this characterization enables scientists to understand how the Ni and Pt layers interact, how they are distributed, and how their properties change under various conditions. It helps in predicting the behavior of the bimetallic surface in catalytic applications, such as hydrogen production, water splitting, and other chemical reactions. The detailed information obtained from these techniques is essential for optimizing the surface properties to enhance the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic processes.

The electron reflectivity spectra, in particular, provide insights into the atomic structure and bonding environment of the bimetallic surface. By comparing the spectra of the as-deposited bimetallic surface with those of pure Ni and Pt surfaces, researchers can identify changes in the surface structure and chemistry, which are indicative of the interaction between Ni and Pt atoms. This is critical for understanding the mechanisms of catalytic reactions on the surface and for designing new catalysts with enhanced performance.

Moreover, the work function measurements offer information about the surface potential, which influences the adsorption and desorption of molecules on the surface. The LEED analysis, on the other hand, provides direct evidence of the surface structure, including the presence of any ordered phases or defects. This information is invaluable for predicting the activity and stability of the bimetallic catalyst under reaction conditions.

In summary, the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces using a combination of experimental techniques provides a detailed understanding of the surface properties, which is fundamental for the development of efficient and selective catalytic materials.
