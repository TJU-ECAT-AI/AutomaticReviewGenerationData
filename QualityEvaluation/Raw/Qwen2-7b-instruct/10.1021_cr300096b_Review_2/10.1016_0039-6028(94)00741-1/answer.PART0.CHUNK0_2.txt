[1] "The restricted mobility of adatoms and small dusters of Mo on a Mo(ll0) surface at 300 K prevents regular layer-by-layer development of Mo films deposited on a Pt(lll) surface."
[2] "The electron reflectance spectrum for the v- surface resembled that reported here for Mo growth on Pt(lll), which indicates that the ordered phase is probably the same."
[3] "The alloy phase on the surface of a Pt crystal is metastable with respect to solution of Mo in the Pt substrate under annealing conditions."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves examining the reflectance spectra and LEED patterns. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows scientists to determine the precise structure and composition of the bimetallic interface. By studying these surfaces, researchers can gain insights into how the properties of the individual metals interact and influence each other, which is essential for optimizing their use in catalytic applications.
