[1] "The restricted mobility of adatoms and small dusters of Mo on a Mo(ll0) surface at 300 K prevents regular layer-by-layer development of Mo films deposited on a Pt(lll) surface."
[2] "Electron reflectance spectra are consistent with the film growing, as expected, with Mo(ll0)llPt(lll)."
[3] "Deposition of Mo with the Pt substrate at 430 K produced a more ordered Mo film but growth at 600 K resulted in a different surface structure, presumably due to the increasing effects of Pt diffusion."
[4] "The microstructure of the surface region for a Mo-covered Pt(lll) surface evolves by diffusion of Mo into Pt at temperatures above 700 K and local phase equilibrium is approached."
[5] "Annealing deposits of less than three monolayers of Mo results in a steady loss of Mo from the surface without the separation of new phases. During the annealing of thicker films, the Mo concentration in the solid-solution alloy formed at the surface by Mo diffusion into Pt reaches the solubility limit and the orthorhombic ordered alloy phase Pt2Mo separates."
[6] "The ordered alloy is characterised by a distinctive electron reflectivity spectrum and a (v- × v-)R30 LEED pattern, indicating that it grows with the close-packed (101) alloy plane parallel to Pt(lll)."
[7] "The ordered alloy disappears when continuing diffusion of Mo into Pt causes the concentration of Mo in the solid solution phase to fall below the solubility limit."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The electron reflectance spectra provide insights into the growth mechanism, confirming that the film grows with the Mo(ll0) orientation on the Pt(lll) surface. At 430 K, deposition leads to a more ordered Mo film, while at 600 K, the surface structure changes due to increased Pt diffusion. The microstructure evolves through Mo diffusion into Pt at temperatures above 700 K, leading to local phase equilibrium. Annealing less than three monolayer Mo films causes Mo loss from the surface without phase separation. Thicker films, after annealing, form a solid-solution alloy with the solubility limit reached, resulting in the Pt2Mo ordered alloy phase. This phase exhibits a unique electron reflectivity spectrum and a specific LEED pattern, indicating its growth orientation. As Mo continues to diffuse into the Pt substrate, the concentration drops below the solubility limit, causing the alloy phase to disappear.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面了解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。电子反射谱提供了有关生长机制的见解，表明薄膜以Mo(ll0)取向在Pt(lll)表面上生长。在430 K下沉积可导致更有序的Mo薄膜，而600 K时表面结构发生变化，主要是由于Pt扩散增加。微结构通过在700 K以上的温度下Mo扩散到Pt中发展，导致局部相平衡形成。少于三层Mo薄膜的退火导致表面Mo损失而不产生新相。较厚的薄膜，在退火后形成固溶体合金，Mo的溶解度极限被达到，形成了Pt2Mo有序合金相。该相具有独特的电子反射谱和特定的LEED模式，表明其生长方向。随着Mo继续扩散进入Pt基质，其浓度降至溶解度极限以下，导致合金相消失。
