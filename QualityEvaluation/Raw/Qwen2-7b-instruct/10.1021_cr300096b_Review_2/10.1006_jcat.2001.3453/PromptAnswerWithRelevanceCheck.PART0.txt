Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves maintaining a base pressure of 2 × 1010 Torr in a UHV chamber equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The deposition of Ni onto the Pt(111) surface is carried out at 600 K, ensuring a uniform coverage. The reactivity of these surfaces, particularly when coated with approximately one monolayer of Ni, is compared to that of a pure Pt(111) surface and a thick Ni(111) film in the investigation of low-temperature hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene.
