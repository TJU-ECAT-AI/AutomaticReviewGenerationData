1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves examining their electronic and chemical properties through various techniques. The process is crucial for understanding their behavior in catalytic applications, particularly in hydrogen desulfurization reactions.

2. The Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces exhibit weaker metalhydrogen bonds compared to pure Pt surfaces. This leads to a lower temperature of recombinative D2 desorption, indicating a lower binding energy between hydrogen atoms and the surface.

3. The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces typically involves depositing a monolayer of Ni on the Pt(111) surface. This process allows for the creation of a unique surface structure with distinct electronic and chemical properties.

4. The D2 desorption peak from the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is centered at 253K, with a low-temperature shoulder at 226K, indicating the strength of the hydrogen bonding.

5. The preadsorption of hydrogen on the surface of Pt(111) reduces the production of butadiene, possibly due to hydrogen blocking the active sites required for the formation of this compound.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及通过在单晶Pt或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来检查它们的电子和化学性质。这一过程对于理解其在催化应用中的行为至关重要，尤其是在氢脱硫反应中。

2. Ni/Pt双金属表面显示出与纯Pt表面相比更弱的金属氢键。这导致了D2重组脱附温度的降低，表明表面氢原子与表面之间的结合能较低。

3. Ni/Pt双金属表面的合成通常涉及在Pt(111)表面上沉积一层Ni。这一过程允许创建具有独特电子和化学性质的独特表面结构。

4. Ni/Pt双金属表面的D2脱附峰中心位于253K，低温肩部位于226K，表明氢键的强度。

5. 在Pt(111)表面预吸附氢会导致丁二烯的生产量减少，可能是因为氢堵塞了形成这种化合物所需的关键活性位点。
