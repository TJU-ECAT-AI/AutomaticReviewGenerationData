Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves maintaining a base pressure of 2 × 1010 Torr in a UHV chamber equipped with Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The deposition of Ni onto the Pt(111) surface is carried out at 600 K, ensuring a uniform coverage. The reactivity of these surfaces, particularly when coated with approximately one monolayer of Ni, is compared to that of a pure Pt(111) surface and a thick Ni(111) film in the investigation of low-temperature hydrodesulfurization (HDS) of thiophene.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在压力为2×1010托的高真空室中使用Auger电子光谱（AES）、低能电子衍射（LEED）和温度程序脱附（TPD）。在600 K下将Ni沉积到Pt(111)表面，确保覆盖均匀。这些表面的反应性，特别是当涂覆约一层Ni时，与纯Pt(111)表面和厚Ni(111)薄膜进行比较，在研究噻吩的低温氢化脱硫（HDS）中。
