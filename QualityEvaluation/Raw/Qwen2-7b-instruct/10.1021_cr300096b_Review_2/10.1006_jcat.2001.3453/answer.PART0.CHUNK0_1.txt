[1] "The single crystal sample was a [111] oriented 1.5-mm-thick platinum disk (99.999%), 12 mm in diameter, purchased from Metal Crystals and Oxides, Ltd., Cambridge, England."
[2] "After initial conditioning, the amount of impurity buildup was below the detection limit of AES."
[3] "The preparation of the Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces was described in detail previously (12)."
[4] "This low-temperature peak corresponds directly to the weak MH bond seen on the monolayer Ni/Pt(111) surface."

1. The Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces are synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The AES analysis confirms that the impurity buildup on the surface is minimal, ensuring the purity of the material.
3. The monolayer Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surface shows a weak metalhydrogen bond, which is identified by its low-temperature peak in the TPD spectra.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面是通过在铂单晶或聚晶铂基板上沉积一层Ni单层合成的。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对先进表面科学和催化研究中这些表面的电子和化学性质的理解至关重要。
2. AES分析证实杂质积累量低于检测极限，保证了材料的纯度。
3. 单层Ni/Pt(111)双金属表面显示出较弱的金属氢键，这从其TPD谱中的低温峰得到识别。
