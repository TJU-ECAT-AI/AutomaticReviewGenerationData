Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It allows for detailed analysis and simulation of surface interactions, reaction mechanisms, and catalytic activities. The AES and LEED techniques are employed to confirm the purity and ordering of the surfaces, respectively. Understanding the properties of these bimetallic surfaces is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research.
