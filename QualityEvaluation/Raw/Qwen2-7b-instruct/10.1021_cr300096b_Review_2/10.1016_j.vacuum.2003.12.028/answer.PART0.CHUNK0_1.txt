[1] "Accurate measurements of the structure of clean Pt(12 12 11) and Cu covered Pt(1 1 1) surface have been performed using MEIS and HAS."
[2] "The data indicates that while the clean Pt (12 12 11) surface is essentially unreconstructed, the Cu covered Pt(1 1 1) surface appears to undergo a reconstruction that's essentially constant for all coverages up to 1 ML provided the deposition temperature is 300 K or less."
[3] "There appear to be two main diffusion processes that are activated with temperature. While bulk diffusion of Cu into Pt(1 1 1) appears to be activated above 500 K, an additional process is activated just above room temperature."

This study provides a detailed comparative analysis of the growth and alloying of a submonolayer of copper on the vicinal surface of platinum(12 12 11). The researchers utilized helium atom scattering (HAS) and medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) techniques to characterize the initial structure of copper on the stepped platinum surface and to investigate its redistribution across the surface and into the bulk upon annealing. HAS proved particularly sensitive to the electronic structure of the surface layer, while MEIS accurately probed the atom core structure of the surface. This combined approach enabled the identification of two significant diffusion transitions on the surface occurring at temperatures of 450 and 600 K. The study highlights the importance of step edges in surface growth processes and the role they play in enhancing the structural information obtained about crystal surface growth. Furthermore, the investigation of the structure and thermal vibrations of a clean platinum(12 12 11) surface, as well as the submonolayer growth of copper on this surface at various temperatures and coverages, offers valuable insights into the dynamics of surface kinetics and the mechanisms governing the alloying of copper and platinum at the nanoscale. The research contributes to our understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, which are critical for advanced surface science and catalysis applications.

这项研究对在（12 12 11）面上生长的亚单层铜的生长和合金化进行了详细比较分析。研究人员利用氦原子散射（HAS）和中能离子散射（MEIS）技术来表征铜在步面铂表面的初始结构，并研究其在退火过程中的重新分布及其向内部扩散的情况。HAS特别敏感于表面层的电子结构，而MEIS准确地探查了表面的原子核心结构。这种结合方法使得能够测量铜在阶梯状铂表面上的初始结构，并研究其在不同温度和覆盖度下的扩散情况。研究表明，在450 K和600 K温度下存在两个显著的扩散过渡。研究强调了边缘在表面生长过程中的重要性，以及它们在增强晶面生长过程中所扮演的角色。此外，对清洁铂（12 12 11）表面的结构和热振动的研究，以及该表面在不同温度和覆盖率下生长的亚单层铜，提供了关于表面动力学和纳米尺度上铜和铂合金化机制的有价值见解。研究为先进的表面科学和催化应用中双金属表面的电子和化学性质的理解做出了贡献。
