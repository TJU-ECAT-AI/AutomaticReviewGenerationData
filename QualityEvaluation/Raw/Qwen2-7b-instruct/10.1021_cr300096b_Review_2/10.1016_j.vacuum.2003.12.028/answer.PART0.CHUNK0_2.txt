[1] "The combination of Cu and Pt is expected to generate interesting structures as there is an 8% difference in the lattice constant for these materials hence epitaxial growth will involve considerable lattice strain."
[2] "The HAS and MEIS data identify two significant diffusion transitions on the surface occurring at temperatures of 450 and 600 K."
[3] "The variation in yield as a function of temperature is revealed in Fig. 7. From this figure it is clear that at approximately 350 K, the Cu signal starts to decline and the first layer Pt signal starts to rise."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for the accurate measurements of the structure of these surfaces using techniques like medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD). The precise structural information gathered enables detailed structural modeling and computational simulations through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This understanding is essential for comprehensively exploring the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The ability to manipulate the surface structure at the atomic level can significantly influence the activity and selectivity of catalysts, which is critical for various industrial applications such as hydrogen production, chemical synthesis, and environmental remediation.
