[1] "Accurate measurements of the structure of clean Pt(12 12 11) and Cu covered Pt(12 12 11) have been performed using MEIS and HAS."
[2] "The data indicates that while the clean Pt (12 12 11) surface is essentially unreconstructed, the Cu covered Pt(1 1 1) surface appears to undergo a reconstruction thats essentially constant for all coverages up to 1 ML provided the deposition temperature is 300 K or less."
[3] "There appear to be two main diffusion processes that are activated with tem- perature. While bulk diffusion of Cu into Pt(1 1 1) appears to be activated above 500 K, an additional process is activated just above room temperature."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through accurate measurements using Medium Energy Ion Scattering (MEIS) and Helium Atom Scattering (HAS). These techniques provide insights into the structure and dynamics of the surfaces. This process is crucial because it allows for structural modeling and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, enhancing our understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, such detailed knowledge is essential for optimizing catalyst performance and developing new materials.
