[1] "Accurate measurements of the structure of clean Pt(12 12 11) and Cu covered Pt(12 12 11) have been performed using MEIS and HAS."
[2] "The data indicates that while the clean Pt (12 12 11) surface is essentially unreconstructed, the Cu covered Pt(1 1 1) surface appears to undergo a reconstruction thats essentially constant for all coverages up to 1 ML provided the deposition temperature is 300 K or less."
[3] "There appear to be two main diffusion processes that are activated with tem- perature. While bulk diffusion of Cu into Pt(1 1 1) appears to be activated above 500 K, an additional process is activated just above room temperature."

This study provides a detailed comparative analysis of the growth and alloying of a submonolayer of copper on the vicinal surface of platinum(12 12 11). The researchers utilized helium atom scattering (HAS) and medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) techniques to characterize the initial structure of copper on the stepped platinum surface and to investigate its redistribution across the surface and into the bulk upon annealing. HAS proved particularly sensitive to the electronic structure of the surface layer, while MEIS accurately probed the atom core structure of the surface. This combined approach enabled the identification of two significant diffusion transitions on the surface occurring at temperatures of 450 and 600 K. The study highlights the importance of step edges in surface growth processes and the role they play in enhancing the structural information obtained about crystal surface growth. Furthermore, the investigation of the structure and thermal vibrations of a clean platinum(12 12 11) surface, as well as the submonolayer growth of copper on this surface at various temperatures and coverages, offers valuable insights into the dynamics of surface kinetics and the mechanisms governing the alloying of copper and platinum at the nanoscale. The research contributes to our understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, which are critical for advanced surface science and catalysis applications.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for the accurate measurements of the structure of these surfaces using techniques like medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD). The precise structural information gathered enables detailed structural modeling and computational simulations through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This understanding is essential for comprehensively exploring the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The ability to manipulate the surface structure at the atomic level can significantly influence the activity and selectivity of catalysts, which is critical for various industrial applications such as hydrogen production, chemical synthesis, and environmental remediation.

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for precise control over the composition and structure of the surface, enabling detailed analysis of the interactions between Ni and Pt atoms. These interactions are fundamental to understanding the performance of the bimetallic catalysts, including their activity, selectivity, and stability.

2. The reflectivity of the surface is continuously monitored as the sample is annealed. This monitoring helps determine if the film undergoes any rearrangement during annealing. If no rearrangement occurs, the reflectivity would drop exponentially with increasing temperature, reflecting the enhanced thermal vibration effects of the target atoms. Any deviation from this exponential decay suggests that the surface undergoes structural changes, such as rearrangements or reconstructions.

3. Upon depositing a Cu monolayer on Pt(12 12 11), it was observed that the Cu overlayer relaxes. This relaxation implies that the Cu atoms adjust their positions to accommodate the lattice mismatch between Cu and Pt, minimizing the lattice strain. This process is significant for understanding the mechanical stability and adhesion of the Cu layer on the Pt surface.

4. The movement of elements, specifically Cu and Pt, is noted around 350 K. The increase in the Pt signal and decrease in the Cu signal indicate that the elements are diffusing within the near-surface region of the Cu/Pt bimetallic system. This observation suggests that the surface undergoes a rearrangement or reconstruction process at this temperature range, which might be associated with alloying or other structural modifications.

5. Precise measurements of the structure of clean Pt(12 12 11) and Cu-covered Pt(1 1 1) surfaces have been conducted using MEIS (Medium Energy Ion Scattering) and HAS (Helium Atom Scattering). These techniques provide valuable insights into the atomic-level structure of the surfaces, which is essential for understanding their properties and behavior under various conditions. The combined use of MEIS and HAS offers complementary information on the electronic and structural aspects of the surfaces, enhancing our knowledge of the bimetallic systems.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它允许对Ni和Pt原子之间的精确控制，从而实现对表面的详细分析。这些相互作用是理解双金属催化剂性能（包括活性、选择性和稳定性）的基础。

2. 在样品退火过程中连续监测表面的反射率。这有助于确定薄膜是否在退火过程中发生任何重排。如果没有任何重排，反射率会随着温度的增加呈指数下降，反映出目标原子振动增强的影响。任何偏离这种指数衰减的迹象表明表面经历了结构变化，如重排或重建。

3. 在Pt(12 12 11)表面上沉积Cu单层后，观察到Cu过层发生松弛。这种松弛意味着Cu原子调整其位置以适应Cu和Pt材料之间的晶格差异，最小化晶格应变。这一过程对于理解Cu层在Pt表面的机械稳定性和粘附性至关重要。

4. 在大约350 K时，元素（尤其是Cu和Pt）的移动被注意到。Pt信号的增加和Cu信号的减少表明元素在近表面区域的Cu/Pt双金属系统内部扩散。这一观察结果表明，在这个温度范围内，表面可能经历了一种重组或重构过程，这可能与合金化或其他结构修改有关。

5. 使用中能离子散射（MEIS）和氦原子散射（HAS）精确测量了清洁的Pt(12 12 11)表面和覆盖有Cu的Pt(1 1 1)表面的结构。这些技术提供了关于表面原子级结构的有价值信息，这对于理解它们的性质和在各种条件下的行为至关重要。MEIS和HAS的结合使用为表面的电子和结构方面提供了补充信息，增强了我们对双金属系统的知识。
