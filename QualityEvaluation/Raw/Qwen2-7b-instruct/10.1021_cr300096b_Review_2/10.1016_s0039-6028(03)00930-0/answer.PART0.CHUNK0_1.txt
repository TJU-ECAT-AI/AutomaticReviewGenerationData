<p>Vanadium pseudomorphic overlayer exhibits a c(2 × 2) magnetic structure with a zero net magnetization.</p>
<p>Chromium and Mn pseudomorphic overlayers exhibit both the c(2 × 2) and p(1 × 1) magnetic structures with a preference of the former structure, which is more pronounced in the Cr/Pt(0 0 1) system.</p>
<p>The substitutional alloyed overlayers exhibit ferrimagnetic ordering in the case of V0.5Pt0.5 and Cr0.5Pt0.5 overlayers, whereas unequal local magnetic moments aligned in the same directions are obtained in the case of the Mn0.5Pt0.5 overlayer.</p>

1. Vanadium pseudomorphic monolayer displays a c(2 × 2) magnetic arrangement with no net magnetization.
2. Chromium and Mn monolayers both show c(2 × 2) and p(1 × 1) magnetic patterns, with the c(2 × 2) being more dominant in the Cr/Pt(0 0 1) system.
3. Alloyed substitutional overlayers demonstrate ferrimagnetic structures in V0.5Pt0.5 and Cr0.5Pt0.5, while the Mn0.5Pt0.5 overlayer shows unequal magnetic moments aligned similarly.

1. 硼化物单层范德瓦尔斯显示了c(2×2)磁性排列，没有净磁化。
2. 铬和锰单层都表现出c(2×2)和p(1×1)磁性模式，其中c(2×2)在Cr/Pt(0 0 1)系统中更为突出。
3. 合金替代覆盖层在V0.5Pt0.5和Cr0.5Pt0.5中表现出铁磁结构，在Mn0.5Pt0.5覆盖层中则显示出不等的磁矩沿着相同方向对齐。
