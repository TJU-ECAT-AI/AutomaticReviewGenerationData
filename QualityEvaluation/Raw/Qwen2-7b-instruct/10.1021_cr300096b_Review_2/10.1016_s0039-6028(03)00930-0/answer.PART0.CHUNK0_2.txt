<p>Vanadium pseudomorphic overlayer exhibits a c(2 × 2) magnetic structure with a zero net magnetization.</p>
<p>Chromium and Mn pseudomorphic overlayers exhibit both the c(2 × 2) and p(1 × 1) magnetic structures with a preference of the former structure, which is more pronounced in the Cr/Pt(0 0 1) system.</p>
<p>The substitutional alloyed overlayers exhibit ferrimagnetic ordering in the case of V0.5Pt0.5 and Cr0.5Pt0.5 overlayers, whereas unequal local magnetic moments aligned in the same directions are obtained in the case of the Mn0.5Pt0.5 overlayer.</p>
<p>In this work, we investigated the magnetic structure of V, Cr and Mn pseudomorphic overlayers and their substitutional alloys adsorbed at Pt(0 0 1) surfaces.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
