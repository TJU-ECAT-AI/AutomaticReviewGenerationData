[1] "In this communication we present a theoretical study to investigate the effect of the substitutional alloying on the magnetic map of V, Cr and Mn transition metals adsorbed Pt(0 0 1)."
[2] "Each substitutional alloyed overlayer is formed of 50% of one of the 3d transition metals plus 50% Pt."
[3] "From this table one can notice that V0.5Pt0.5 and Cr0.5Pt0.5 substitutional alloyed overlayers exhibit ferrimagnetic structures, whereas those on Mn0.5Pt0.5 overlayer are unequal moments aligned in the same direction."
[4] "These behaviors are the same as those obtained in a previous study using Pd(0 0 1) as a substrate."

This document investigates the impact of substitutional alloying on the magnetic properties of vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), and manganese (Mn) monolayers adsorbed on a platinum (Pt) (0 0 1) substrate. It presents a theoretical study using the semiempirical tight-binding method to analyze the magnetic configurations of these transition metals and their alloyed structures. The results show that the substitutional alloyed overlayers exhibit ferrimagnetic structures, with unequal local magnetic moments aligned in the same direction, similar to findings in a previous study using palladium (Pd) as the substrate.
