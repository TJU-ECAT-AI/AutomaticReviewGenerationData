The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through theoretical simulations using computational methods such as the tight-binding method within the Hartree-Fock approximation with the Hubbard Hamiltonian. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The investigation reveals that the magnetic structure of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces can be influenced by the specific composition and the underlying substrate, leading to diverse magnetic configurations and behaviors.
