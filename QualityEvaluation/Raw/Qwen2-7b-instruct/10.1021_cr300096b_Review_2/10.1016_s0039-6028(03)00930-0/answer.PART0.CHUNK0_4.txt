The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through theoretical studies using the tight-binding method within the Hartree-Fock approximation employing the Hubbard Hamiltonian. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The study investigates the magnetic structures of V, Cr, and Mn pseudomorphic overlayers and their substitutional alloys adsorbed on Pt(0 0 1) surfaces, providing insights into the stabilization of the ferromagnetic configuration through alloying.
