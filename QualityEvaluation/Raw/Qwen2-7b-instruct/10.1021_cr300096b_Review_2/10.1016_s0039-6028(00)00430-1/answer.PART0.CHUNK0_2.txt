1. In the case of Re/Pt(111), chemically distinct species can form in as-deposited, single-layer islands, including a central and an edge species.
2. None of the components identified in the Pt 4f7/2 spectra had a binding energy as low as the Pt(111) surface component.
3. With similarities in crystal structure and lattice mismatch, we expect submonolayer platinum films on Rh(100) to resemble an unreconstructed Pt(100) surface.
4. The platinum stays on the surface after annealing, as indicated by the survival of the low-binding-energy component.
5. For CO/Pt(100), a c(2×2) overlayer forms, saturating at 0.5 ML, composed of two domains with exclusive on-top or bridge CO adsorption.

1. 在Re/Pt(111)的情况下，可以形成两种化学不同的物种，在沉积的单层岛屿中，包括中心和边缘物种。
2. 在Pt 4f7/2光谱中识别的所有成分的结合能均未达到与111 Pt表面成分相同的能量水平。
3. 鉴于铂和铑具有相似的晶体结构和只有3%的晶格失配，我们期望在Rh(100)上的亚单层铂薄膜与重构前的Pt(100)表面非常相似。
4. 通过退火后低结合能成分的存活，表明铂留在表面上。
5. 对于CO/Pt(100)，观察到一个c(2×2)层覆盖，饱和在0.5 ML，由两个包含仅顶部或桥接CO吸附的域组成。
