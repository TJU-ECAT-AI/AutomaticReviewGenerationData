[1] "Platinum was found to grow as small, single-layer islands on Rh(100)."
[2] "The CO saturation coverage on a platinum monolayer on Rh(100) is strongly reduced compared with that on Pt(100)."
[3] "Moreover, the preferential CO adsorption site on platinum is seen to vary with platinum coverage."
[4] "On a 0.2 ML platinum film the bridge site is preferred, on 0.5 ML platinum the on-top site is preferred, and for the 0.9 ML platinum film an even distribution between bridge and on-top adsorption is found."

1. Platinum is characterized by growing as small, single-layer islands on Rh(100) surfaces.
2. The CO saturation coverage on a platinum monolayer on Rh(100) is significantly reduced compared to Pt(100).
3. The preferred CO adsorption site on platinum varies with the amount of platinum coverage.
4. On a 0.2 ML platinum film, the bridge site is favored, on a 0.5 ML film, the on-top site is preferred, and for a 0.9 ML film, an even distribution between bridge and on-top adsorption sites is observed.

1. 钯在Rh(100)表面上生长为小型单层岛屿。
2. 在Rh(100)上的铂单层的CO饱和覆盖度显著低于Pt(100)。
3. 铂上的CO吸附偏好位点随铂覆盖度的变化而变化。
4. 在0.2 ML的铂薄膜上，桥位更受欢迎；在0.5 ML的薄膜上，顶位更受欢迎；对于0.9 ML的薄膜，桥位和顶位之间的吸附分布趋于均匀。
