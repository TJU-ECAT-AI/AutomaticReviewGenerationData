[1] "Platinum was found to grow as small, single-layer islands on Rh(100)."
[2] "The CO saturation coverage on a platinum monolayer on Rh(100) is strongly reduced compared with that on Pt(100)."
[3] "A site switch for CO from on-top to bridge sites in the c(2×2) CO overlayer on Rh(100) has been observed in the presence of 0.2 ML of platinum."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Platinum was discovered to form as tiny, single-layer clusters on Rh(100).
2. The maximum amount of CO that can adhere to a platinum monolayer on Rh(100) is significantly less than that on Pt(100).
3. The placement of CO on Rh(100) changed from on-top to bridge sites when 0.2 ML of platinum was present.

1. 铂被发现形成在Rh(100)上的微小单层簇。
2. 在Rh(100)上，铂单层能够吸附的CO的最大量远小于Pt(100)。
3. 当存在0.2 ML的铂时，Rh(100)上的CO位置从顶部切换到桥接位置。
