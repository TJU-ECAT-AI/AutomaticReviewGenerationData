[1] "Submonolayers of platinum have been deposited on an Rh(100) substrate."
[2] "It will be shown that CO adsorption on the rhodium and platinum patches of the bimetallic surface is different from that on Rh(100) and Pt(100), respectively."
[3] "We have recently published a study of CO adsorption on the Rh(100) surface [9]."
[4] "For the Cu/Rh(100) system, the valence d-band and the copper core levels are shifted to lower binding energy as a consequence of the interaction between copper and rhodium."
[5] "This finding agrees with the general trends reported for CO adsorption on group 10 metals in bimetallic systems."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition of a Ni monolayer on a Pt substrate allows for the study of the interaction between the two metals, leading to insights into the formation of distinct structures and the modification of electronic and chemical properties. The shifts in binding energies observed for copper and rhodium in related systems indicate the importance of considering metal interactions in bimetallic systems. The reduced CO saturation coverage on a platinum monolayer on Rh(100) compared to Pt(100) provides evidence for weakened CO-Pt bonds in the presence of the Rh(100) substrate, aligning with trends reported for CO adsorption on group 10 metals in bimetallic systems.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究中的电子和化学性质至关重要。在Pt基片上沉积Ni单层允许研究两种金属之间的相互作用，从而为形成独特结构和修改电子和化学性质提供见解。铜和铑中观察到的结合能变化表明考虑双金属系统中金属间的相互作用的重要性。铂单层上Rh(100)上的CO饱和覆盖率明显低于Pt(100)，这提供了CO-Pt键在Rh(100)基底存在的情况下减弱的证据，与10族金属在双金属系统中的吸附趋势相吻合。
