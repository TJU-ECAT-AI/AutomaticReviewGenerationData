[1] "Before turning to the results of CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100), it is useful to recap some of our earlier findings for CO/Rh(100) [9]."
[2] "For CO coverages between 0.2 and 0.6 ML we observe a c(2×2) overlayer by LEED."
[3] "Exposures of 0.5 to 1.0 L at RT will result in this structure."
[4] "At 10 L exposure at RT, a structure is formed."
[5] "This structure saturates at 0.75 ML and contains predominantly CO in bridge sites with a C 1s binding energy of 285.45 eV."
[6] "Finally, dosing 100 L at 0C yields a c(6×2) structure saturating at 0.83 ML."
[7] "It was found that this structure contains on-top and bridge sites in close to a one-to-one ratio."
[8] "To further elucidate the effect of the platinumrhodium interaction, we now look at CO sticking on the bimetallic surfaces."
[9] "Fig. 4 shows CO coverage as a function of CO exposure for several platinum coverages on Rh(100)."
[10] "The CO coverage has been estimated from photoemission intensities of C 1s and CO valence levels."
[11] "We find that this method gives coverages in the correct intervals for the all of the overlayer structures for CO/Rh(100)."
[12] "The agreement between the coverage estimated from C 1s and from the valence levels is always good."
[13] "Clearly, the saturation coverage on the former is lower than on the latter."
[14] "Since the quasi-hexagonal reconstruction of Pt(100) is lifted upon CO adsorption (see, e.g.,[24] and references therein), CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100) should be directly comparable to adsorption on Pt(100)."
[15] "Clearly, the saturation coverage on the former is lower than on the latter."
[16] "As shown in Section 3.1 , we observe a shift of the Pt 4f level towards higher binding energy for platinum in contact with rhodium."
[17] "We therefore believe that the contact with the rhodium substrate is responsible for the reduced CO sticking on the platinum overlayer through a ligand effect."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. 

In the case of CO adsorption on Pt/Rh(100), the characterization includes observing the formation of a c(2×2) overlayer with predominantly CO adsorbed in bridge sites. This structure saturates at 0.75 ML at 10 L exposure at RT. Another structure, with predominantly on-top and bridge sites in close to a one-to-one ratio, forms at 100 L exposure at 0C, saturating at 0.83 ML. 

The effect of the platinum-rhodium interaction on CO sticking is elucidated through CO coverage as a function of CO exposure for several platinum coverages on Rh(100). The saturation coverage on Pt/Rh(100) is lower than on Pt(100). This is attributed to the shift of the Pt 4f level towards higher binding energy in contact with rhodium, which affects the CO metal bond through a ligand effect.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，特别是在高级表面科学和催化研究的背景下。

对于Pt/Rh(100)上的CO吸附，表征包括观察形成c(2×2)层，其中CO主要吸附在桥位点。这种结构在10 L RT下暴露饱和于0.75 ML。在100 L 0°C下暴露时形成另一种结构，主要包含on-top和桥位点，在一个接近一比一的比例下，饱和于0.83 ML。

铂铑相互作用对CO粘附的影响通过在Rh(100)上的不同铂覆盖度下CO覆盖度随CO暴露的变化进行了阐明。Pt/Rh(100)上的饱和覆盖度低于Pt(100)。这归因于铂与铑接触时4f能级向较高结合能的偏移，从而通过配体效应影响CO金属键。
