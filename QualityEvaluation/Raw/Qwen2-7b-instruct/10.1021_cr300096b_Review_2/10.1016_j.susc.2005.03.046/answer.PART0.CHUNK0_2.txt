The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves theoretical calculations and experimental studies. The process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) are utilized to investigate reactions of hydrogen and ethylene on various surfaces. Submonolayer and monolayer Pd-modification of the Mo(110) surface results in a decrease in the binding energy of hydrogen and a reduction in the degree of ethylene decomposition. The Pt/W(110) surfaces with submonolayer and monolayer Pt coverages show a reduced hydrogen binding energy as compared to either W(110) or Pt(111), as predicted by DFT modeling and verified by TPD measurements. The ML Pt/W(110) surface bonds to ethylene more weakly than either W(110) or Pt(111).

对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，通过在单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层，涉及理论计算和实验研究。这一过程对于理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。密度泛函理论（DFT）、温度程序脱附（TPD）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）被用来研究各种表面的氢和乙烯反应。Mo(110)表面的亚单层和单层Pd修饰导致氢的结合能降低和乙烯分解度的减少。与W(110)或Pt(111)相比，Pt/W(110)表面的亚单层和单层Pt覆盖显示出较低的氢结合能，这符合DFT模型预测并通过TPD测量验证。ML Pt/W(110)表面与乙烯的结合力较弱，而与W(110)或Pt(111)相比。
