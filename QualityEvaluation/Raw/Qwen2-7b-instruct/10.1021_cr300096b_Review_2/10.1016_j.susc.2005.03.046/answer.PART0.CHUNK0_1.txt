[1] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(1 1 1) or Pt on Ni(1 1 1)."
[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface as compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1)."

Answer: How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces because it allows for the creation of surfaces with distinct chemical properties that differ from those of the individual metals. The interaction between the subsurface Ni atoms and the Pt atoms leads to a shift in the d-band center of the Pt surface away from the Fermi level. This shift results in a reduction of the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. This process enables the detailed examination of the structural properties of the bimetallic surfaces, facilitating advanced surface science and catalysis research through the use of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

如何通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基体上沉积一层Ni来表征Ni/Pt双金属表面，并且为什么这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下？

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及到在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基体上沉积一层Ni。这个过程对于理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许创建具有与各自金属不同的独特化学性质的表面。Ni原子与Pt原子之间的相互作用导致Pt表面的d能带中心远离费米能级，从而降低了ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面上氢和烯烃的吸附能，与Pt(1 1 1)或Ni(1 1 1)表面相比。这个过程使得对双金属表面的详细结构性质进行仔细检查成为可能，这为高级表面科学和催化研究提供了利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的途径。
