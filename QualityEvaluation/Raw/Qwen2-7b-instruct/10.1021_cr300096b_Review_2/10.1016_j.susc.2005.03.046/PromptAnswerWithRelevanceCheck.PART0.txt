The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to study the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The interaction between the Ni and Pt layers causes a shift in the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms, which affects the adsorption energy of molecules like hydrogen and olefins. This leads to unique chemical properties that differ from the parent metals.

Answer: How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces because it allows for the creation of surfaces with distinct chemical properties that differ from those of the individual metals. The interaction between the subsurface Ni atoms and the Pt atoms leads to a shift in the d-band center of the Pt surface away from the Fermi level. This shift results in a reduction of the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1) surface compared to on either Pt(1 1 1) or Ni(1 1 1) surfaces. This process enables the detailed examination of the structural properties of the bimetallic surfaces, facilitating advanced surface science and catalysis research through the use of Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

如何通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基体上沉积一层Ni来表征Ni/Pt双金属表面，并且为什么这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下？

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及到在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基体上沉积一层Ni。这个过程对于理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，因为它允许创建具有与各自金属不同的独特化学性质的表面。Ni原子与Pt原子之间的相互作用导致Pt表面的d能带中心远离费米能级，从而降低了ML Ni/Pt(1 1 1)表面上氢和烯烃的吸附能，与Pt(1 1 1)或Ni(1 1 1)表面相比。这个过程使得对双金属表面的详细结构性质进行仔细检查成为可能，这为高级表面科学和催化研究提供了利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的途径。

The process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. Density functional theory (DFT), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) are utilized to investigate reactions of hydrogen and ethylene on various surfaces. Submonolayer and monolayer Pd-modification of the Mo(110) surface results in a decrease in the binding energy of hydrogen and a reduction in the degree of ethylene decomposition. The Pt/W(110) surfaces with submonolayer and monolayer Pt coverages show a reduced hydrogen binding energy as compared to either W(110) or Pt(111), as predicted by DFT modeling and verified by TPD measurements.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，通过在单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层，涉及理论计算和实验研究。这一过程对于理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。密度泛函理论（DFT）、温度程序脱附（TPD）和高分辨率电子能量损失光谱（HREELS）被用来研究各种表面的氢和乙烯反应。Mo(110)表面的亚单层和单层Pd修饰导致氢的结合能降低和乙烯分解度的减少。与W(110)或Pt(111)相比，Pt/W(110)表面的亚单层和单层Pt覆盖显示出较低的氢结合能，这符合DFT模型预测并通过TPD测量验证。ML Pt/W(110)表面与乙烯的结合力较弱，而与W(110)或Pt(111)相比。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for the examination of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly focusing on the interaction between Ni and Pt at the interface. The shift in the d-band center of the Pt atoms due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni leads to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefins on the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface compared to the individual Pt or Ni surfaces. This is significant for understanding the catalytic properties of the bimetallic system and can aid in the rational design of catalysts with desired functionalities.
