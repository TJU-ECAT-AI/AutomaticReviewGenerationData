[1] "An excellent example of a bimetallic system that displays novel catalytic properties is the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface, which can be prepared by either depositing Ni on Pt(111) [5] or Pt on Ni(111) [15]."
[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface as compared to on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."
[3] "The focus of the current paper is to investigate other monolayer metal films to determine if they display similar chemical properties as in the Ni/Pt bimetallic system."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial because it allows for the examination of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly focusing on the interaction between Ni and Pt at the interface. The shift in the d-band center of the Pt atoms due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni leads to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefins on the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface compared to the individual Pt or Ni surfaces. This is significant for understanding the catalytic properties of the bimetallic system and can aid in the rational design of catalysts with desired functionalities.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及到在单晶Pt（111）或聚晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这个过程对于研究这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要，特别是关注Ni和Pt界面之间的相互作用。由于Ni原子与表面下Pt原子的相互作用导致Pt原子d带中心偏离费米能级，这使得Ni/Pt双金属表面的氢和烯烃吸附能相较于单一的Pt或Ni表面显著降低。这对于理解双金属系统的催化性能并指导催化剂设计具有重要意义。
