[1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4] ,[5] and experimental studies [6] ,[8] ,[9] ,[16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces."
[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface as compared to on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The interaction between the Ni and Pt layers causes a shift in the d-band center of the Pt atoms, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefins on the Ni/Pt bimetallic surface compared to on the pure Pt or Ni surfaces.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基片上沉积一层Ni单层。这个过程对于理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。Ni和Pt层之间的相互作用导致Pt原子的d带中心偏移，使得Ni/Pt双金属表面的氢和烯烃吸附能相对于纯Pt或Ni表面降低。
