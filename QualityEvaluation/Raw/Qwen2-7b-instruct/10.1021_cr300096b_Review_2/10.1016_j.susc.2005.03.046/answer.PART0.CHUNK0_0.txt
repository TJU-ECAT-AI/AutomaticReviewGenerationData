[1] "We have recently performed theoretical calculations [4] ,[5] and experimental studies [6] ,[8] ,[9] ,[16] to determine the origin of the unique chemical properties of the Ni/Pt(111) surfaces."
[2] "Due to the interaction with the subsurface Ni, the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms is shifted away from the Fermi level, leading to a reduction in the adsorption energy of hydrogen and olefin on the ML Ni/Pt(111) surface as compared to on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to study the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The interaction between the Ni and Pt layers causes a shift in the d-band center of the surface Pt atoms, which affects the adsorption energy of molecules like hydrogen and olefins. This leads to unique chemical properties that differ from the parent metals.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它允许研究者研究这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质。Ni和Pt层之间的相互作用导致表面Pt原子d带中心的偏移，这影响了氢分子和烯烃等分子的吸附能。这导致了与母金属显著不同的独特化学性质。
