The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through extensive investigation utilizing various surface techniques at room temperature. Experimentally, it has been observed that the Pt films exhibit in-plane strain up to 2.0 ML, with a constant average lattice parameter of 2.63260.001 Å, indicating a strong interaction between the deposited film and the substrate. Above 2.0 ML, the lattice parameter increases steadily up to 2.71960.001 Å at 10 ML, demonstrating the influence of the size mismatch on the structure of the deposited film.

[1] "In the earliest stages of the deposition the strong interaction adsorbate substrate leads to the formation of strained islands."
[2] "Then, when the islands extend themselves, avoiding these positions while keeping bulklike Pt-Pt distances becomes only possible by removing Co atoms from the substrate into the Pt adlayer."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the initial stages of deposition, the strong interaction between the adsorbate and substrate results in the formation of strained islands. As the islands grow, maintaining bulk-like Pt-Pt distances while avoiding unfavorable positions becomes achievable only by removing Co atoms from the substrate and incorporating them into the Pt adlayer.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process involves understanding the interaction between the adsorbate and substrate, leading to the formation of strained islands in the initial stages of deposition. As the islands extend, they can only maintain bulk-like Pt-Pt distances by removing Co atoms from the substrate into the Pt adlayer, marking a first step towards the formation of a size-mismatch-induced surface alloy with a specific coverage of 0.80 ML and an optimal concentration of 5% Co atoms in the surface alloy. This condition allows the Pt lattice to release more easily, with the lateral shortest interatomic distance being 2.73 Å. Currently, the difficulty lies in preparing Co surfaces that exhibit only hcp0001 domains, hindering the experimental evidence of the surface alloy formation.
