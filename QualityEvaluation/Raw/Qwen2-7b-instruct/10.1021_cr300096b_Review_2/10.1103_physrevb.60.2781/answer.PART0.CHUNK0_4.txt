[1] "Putting together the simulations and the various experimental results, we can derive the following outline for the first stages of Pt deposition on Co0001!."
[2] "In the earliest stages of the deposition the strong interaction adsorbate substrate leads to the formation of strained islands."
[3] "Then, when the islands extend themselves, avoiding these positions while keeping bulklike Pt-Pt distances becomes only possible by removing Co atoms from the substrate into the Pt adlayer."
[4] "This can be viewed as a first step towards the formation of a size-mismatch-induced surface alloy with a characteristic coverage of u = 0.80 ML and an optimal concentration of Co atoms in the surface alloy of 5%."

How is the characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, conducted, and why is this process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research?

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. By depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt substrate, the interaction between the two metals can be studied, providing insights into the surface alloy formation and the strain energy associated with the size mismatch between the metals. This understanding is vital for advanced surface science and catalysis research, as it helps in designing materials with optimized properties for various applications.
