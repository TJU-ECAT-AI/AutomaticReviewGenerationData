[1] "From the experimental point of view, the growth and structure of Pt/Co0001! at room temperature have been extensively investigated using a large panel of surface techniques."
[2] "Experimentally, the Pt lms are found in-plane strained up to 2.0 ML, with a constant average lattice parameter of 2.63260.001 Å reflecting a strong deposit substrate interaction above 2.0 ML, the lattice parameter steadily increases up to 2.71960.001 Å at 10 ML!"

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through extensive investigation utilizing various surface techniques at room temperature. Experimentally, it has been observed that the Pt films exhibit in-plane strain up to 2.0 ML, with a constant average lattice parameter of 2.63260.001 Å, indicating a strong interaction between the deposited film and the substrate. Above 2.0 ML, the lattice parameter increases steadily up to 2.71960.001 Å at 10 ML, demonstrating the influence of the size mismatch on the structure of the deposited film.

对于Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在室温下使用各种表面技术进行广泛研究。实验结果显示，在单晶Pt（111）或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层时，Pt薄膜表现出至2.0 ML的平面内应力，平均晶格参数为2.63260.001 Å，表明沉积膜与基底之间存在强烈的相互作用。超过2.0 ML，晶格参数稳定增加至10 ML时的2.71960.001 Å，这表明尺寸差异对沉积薄膜结构的影响。

[1] "In the earliest stages of the deposition the strong interaction adsorbate substrate leads to the formation of strained islands."
[2] "Then, when the islands extend themselves, avoiding these positions while keeping bulklike Pt-Pt distances becomes only possible by removing Co atoms from the substrate into the Pt adlayer."

In the initial stages of deposition, the strong interaction between the adsorbate and substrate results in the formation of strained islands. As the islands grow, maintaining bulk-like Pt-Pt distances while avoiding unfavorable positions becomes achievable only by removing Co atoms from the substrate and incorporating them into the Pt adlayer.

在最早的沉积阶段，吸附剂和基底之间的强相互作用导致形成受压岛屿。当岛屿扩展自身时，在避免这些位置的同时保持类似块体的Pt-Pt距离只可能通过从基底移除Co原子并将其融入Pt吸附层实现。
