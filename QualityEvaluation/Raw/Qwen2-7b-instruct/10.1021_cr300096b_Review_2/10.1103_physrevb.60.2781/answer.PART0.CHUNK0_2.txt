[1] "In the earliest stages of the deposition the strong interaction adsorbate substrate leads to the formation of strained islands."
[2] "Then, when the islands extend themselves, avoiding these positions while keeping bulklike Pt-Pt distances becomes only possible by removing Co atoms from the substrate into the Pt adlayer."
[3] "This can be viewed as a first step towards the formation of a size-mismatch-induced surface alloy with a characteristic coverage of u=0.80 ML and an optimal concentration of Co atoms in the surface alloy of 5%."
[4] "In this condition the Pt lattice is able to release more easily, the lateral shortest interatomic distance being Rp0=2.73 Å."
[5] "At the moment, this is hindered by the difficulty in preparing Co surfaces exhibiting only hcp0001! domains."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The process involves understanding the interaction between the adsorbate and substrate, leading to the formation of strained islands in the initial stages of deposition. As the islands extend, they can only maintain bulk-like Pt-Pt distances by removing Co atoms from the substrate into the Pt adlayer, marking a first step towards the formation of a size-mismatch-induced surface alloy with a specific coverage of 0.80 ML and an optimal concentration of 5% Co atoms in the surface alloy. This condition allows the Pt lattice to release more easily, with the lateral shortest interatomic distance being 2.73 Å. Currently, the difficulty lies in preparing Co surfaces that exhibit only hcp0001 domains, hindering the experimental evidence of the surface alloy formation.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来进行的。这个过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。这一过程涉及到理解吸附剂与基底之间的相互作用，导致在沉积的早期阶段形成受压岛。随着岛屿的延伸，只有通过从基底中移除Co原子到Pt吸附层中，才能维持类似晶格的Pt-Pt距离。这标志着形成一种尺寸不匹配诱导的表面合金的第一步，其特征覆盖率为0.80 ML，并且表面合金中的Co原子浓度为5%。在这种情况下，Pt晶格能够更轻松地释放，横向最短原子间距离为2.73 Å。目前的挑战在于准备仅表现出hcp0001晶面的Co表面，这阻碍了表面合金形成的实验证据。
