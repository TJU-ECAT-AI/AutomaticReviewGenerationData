[I] "Generally, simple wetting arguments, based on the difference in surface energies between both elements and on their mixing ability that drives the interfacial energy, are not sufficient to predict the growth modes in the submonolayer range."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the examination of the interaction between the two metals, their mutual influence on surface structure, and the resulting changes in properties that are not predictable solely through wetting arguments.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层来完成的。这个过程对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域中的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要，因为它允许我们研究两种金属之间的相互作用、它们对表面结构的影响以及由此产生的性质变化，这些变化仅通过润湿论无法预测。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
In the tight-binding formalism, the energy of an atom at site i is characterized as the sum of two components: an attractive band energy and a repulsive pair interaction, represented mathematically as \(E_i = E_i^b + E_i^r\).
