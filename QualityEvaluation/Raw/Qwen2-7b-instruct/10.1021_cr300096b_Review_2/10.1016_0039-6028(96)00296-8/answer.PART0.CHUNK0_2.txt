Cu films on Pt(100)hex are characterized by growing with a Cu(100) lattice parameter below 550 K. An ordered Cu3Pt surface alloy with a c(2 × 2) symmetry is prepared at 650 K. A phase transition occurs between 650 and 750 K within the surface alloy, which could be either a (2 × 1) or p(2 × 2) structure. Cu disappears into the bulk of Pt above 950 K, restoring the pure Pt(100)hex structure above 1000 K. All these phases exhibit a pure Cu termination.

在300 K下，Cu蒸发到Pt(100)hex表面上。Cu薄膜在低于550 K时以自己的Cu(100)晶格参数生长。在650 K时，制备出具有c(2 × 2)对称性的有序Cu3Pt表面合金。在650至750 K之间，表面合金发生相变，这可能是(2 × 1)或p(2 × 2)结构。当温度高于950 K时，Cu扩散进入Pt内部，并且当温度高于1000 K时，恢复纯Pt(100)hex结构。所有这些相都表现出纯Cu终止状态。
