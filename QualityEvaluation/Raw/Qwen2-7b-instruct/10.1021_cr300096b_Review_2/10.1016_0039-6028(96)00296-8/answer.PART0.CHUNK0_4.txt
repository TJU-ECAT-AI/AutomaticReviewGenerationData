[1] "Cu deposition at room temperature leads to a local lifting of the hexagonal Pt surface reconstruction which is completed by one pseudomorphic Cu monolayer."
[2] "Below 550 K the Cu then continues to grow with its own Cu(100) lattice parameter."
[3] "With annealing to 650 K an ordered Cu3Pt surface alloy with a c(2 X 2) symmetry and a pure Cu termination could be prepared."
[4] "Between 650 and 750 K a phase transition occurs within the surface alloy, but it is not yet possible to distinguish clearly between a CuPt alloy phase with (2 x 1) structure or a CusPt 3 phase which leads to a p(2 X 2) LEED pattern."
[5] "Above 950 K Cu diffuses into the Pt bulk and above 1000 K the pure Pt(100)hex structure is restored."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
