[1] "Cu was evaporated at 300 K onto the Pt(100)hex surface."
[2] "After the deposition the sample was annealed to 500 K in order to heal out defects."
[3] "Up to this temperature no hints for segregation of Pt into the Cu film was found."
[4] "With increasing Cu coverage the intensity of the extra spots due to the reconstruction decreases (Fig. lb)."
[5] "Additional deposition of Cu on the sample leads to double spots in the LEED (Fig,ld)."
[6] "The additional spots correspond to a lattice constant, which is 8% smaller than that of the Pt(100)l X 1 substrate."
[7] "Therefore, with PAX it is possible to distinguish, whether the reconstruction of the bare Pt patches is also lifted submonolayer amounts of Cu (prior to H 2 adsorption) or by the post-adsorption of hydrogen."
[8] "This experiment shows clearly, that the Cu-free Pt areas are reconstructed before hydrogen adsorption."
[9] "For temperatures higher than 550 K Cu migrates into the Pt bulk."
[10] "Only above 900 K Pt atoms diffuse to the topmost layer and at 1000 K a nearly pure Pt surface is observed."
[11] "For the (111) surface Yeates et al. found Pt in the topmost layer for all annealing temperatures above 500 K as demonstrated by CO-TDS experiments."
[12] "This can be explained by the formation of a L12 structure known for a Cu3Pt alloy."
[13] "The second proposal deduced from the p(2 X 2) pattern is a CusPt 3 alloy with an L13 structure."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The deposition leads to the formation of a L12 structure known for a Cu3Pt alloy, which is Cu-terminated. The process allows for the preparation of ordered surface alloys with specific symmetries, such as a c(2 X 2) structure at 650 K, and a potential p(2 X 2) or (2 X 1) structure at 750 K. The characterization includes techniques like LEED, AES, and PAX to analyze the structure and composition of the surface alloys. The annealing process facilitates the diffusion of Cu into the Pt bulk, and above 900 K, a nearly pure Pt surface is observed. The use of these techniques provides insights into the interactions between Ni and Pt at the atomic level, contributing to the development of catalysts and materials with enhanced functionalities.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及在先进表面科学和催化研究中全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。沉积导致形成已知的Cu3Pt合金的L12结构，该结构是Cu终止的。该过程允许准备具有特定对称性的表面合金，例如在650 K时的c(2 X 2)结构，或者在750 K时的潜在p(2 X 2)或(2 X 1)结构。表征包括使用LEED、AES和PAX等技术来分析表面合金的结构和组成。退火过程促进了Cu向Pt基体中的扩散，而高于900 K时观察到几乎纯的Pt表面。使用这些技术提供了有关Ni和Pt原子级相互作用的见解，从而推动了催化剂和具有增强功能材料的发展。
