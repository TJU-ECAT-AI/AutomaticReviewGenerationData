[1] "Cu was evaporated at 300 K onto the Pt(100)hex surface."
[2] "After the deposition the sample was annealed to 500 K in order to heal out defects."
[3] "Up to this temperature no hints for segregation of Pt into the Cu film was found."
[4] "This lattice constant is typical for Cu, and shows that (beyond the second monolayer) Cu continues to grow with its own lattice constant."
[5] "In order to lift the Pt reconstruction by adsorbing hydrogen at 100 K and short annealing to 300 K."
[6] "Additional annealing leads to the desorption of part of this hydrogen and in a characterization with PAX a Xe-induced 5Pl/2 photoemission peak between 6.0 and 6.1 eV (below Fermi energy) is typical for this system."
[7] "Therefore, with PAX it is possible to distinguish, whether the reconstruction of the bare Pt patches is also lifted submonolayer amounts of Cu (prior to H 2 adsorption) or by the post-adsorption of hydrogen."
[8] "These results are in accordance with the measure- ments of Yeates et al., who also found a diffusion of Cu into the Pt bulk for temperature higher than 500 K for Cu/Pt(111)."
[9] "Only above 900 K Pt atoms diffuse to the topmost layer and at 1000 K a nearly pure Pt surface is observed."
[10] "By further annealing up to 750 K half-order spots appear in the LEED pattern while at the same temperatures the central spot of the c(2 × 2) structure loses intensity."
[11] "The first monolayer is again pure Cu."
[12] "For both possible structures of the alloy produced at 750 K calculation of the normalized Pt intensity from all layers measured by AES using the Lambert-Beer law gives nearly the same value,which shows, that AES alone cannot distinguish."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It enables researchers to examine how the properties of Ni and Pt interact and influence each other, which is fundamental to advanced surface science and catalysis research. The annealing process helps in healing out defects and allows for the study of the diffusion of elements between the two metals. The use of techniques such as AES, LEED, and PAX provides insights into the surface structure, composition, and behavior of these bimetallic systems under different conditions. The ability to distinguish between different structures, such as a (2 × 1) and a p(2 × 2) superstructures, is critical for accurate modeling and interpretation of the experimental data.
