[1] "Cu was evaporated at 300 K onto the Pt(100)hex surface."
[2] "The beam energy was 115 eV for the first three patterns, 100 eV for the 3 ML Cu/(Pt(100)hex pattern."
[3] "An important question concerns the structure of the Cu-free Pt areas for submonolayer Cu coverages."
[4] "In the literature a geometrical argument for the lifting of the reconstruction is given by Sachtler et al. in the case of Au/Pt(100) [6]."
[5] "In agreement with earlier publications [8] Scheffler et al. suggest an electronic explanation for the reconstruction of the Pt(100) surface [11]."
[6] "By contrast, on the (100) surface we found no Pt in the topmost layer up to temperatures of 900 K using PAX intensities as a titration for the various surface sites."
[7] "The results, however, differ for the resultant topmost layer. For the (111) surface Yeates et al. found Pt in the topmost layer for all annealing temperatures above 500 K as demonstrated by CO-TDS experiments."
[8] "These results of chemical analysis show that Pt atoms migrate into the Cu overlayer at temperatures higher than 550 K, but the produced alloy films remain Cu-terminated up to 900 K."
[9] "By further annealing up to 750 K half-order spots appear in the LEED pattern while at the same temperatures the central spot of the c(2 × 2) structure loses intensity."
[10] "This new structure arises either from a (2 × 1) pattern in two domains or a p(2 × 2) structure. At present, it is not possible to distinguish clearly between these two structures because the observed very low intensity of the central spot - differentiating between the (2)< 1) and p(2×2) structures - could also be caused by small remaining areas of the c(2 × 2) alloy."
[11] "Another possibility to explain this behaviour of the central spot is a mixture of both new possible structures on the surface: the (2 X 1) and the p(2 × 2). Further experiments are necessary to explain this complex behaviour of the surface alloy prepared at 750 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The specific method described in the literature is Cu deposition on a Pt(100)hex surface leading to a local lifting of the hexagonal reconstruction, which is completed by a 1 ML Cu. Below 550 K, the Cu film continues to grow with its own lattice parameter. With annealing to 650 K, an ordered Cu3Pt surface alloy with a c(2 X 2) symmetry and a pure Cu termination could be prepared. Between 650 and 750 K, a phase transition occurs within the surface alloy, but it is not possible to distinguish clearly between a CuPt alloy phase with (2 x 1) structure or a CusPt 3 phase leading to a p(2 X 2) LEED pattern. For all these metastable alloy phases, a pure Cu termination was found. Above 950 K, Cu diffuses into the Pt bulk, and above 1000 K, the pure Pt(100)hex structure is restored.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。文献中描述的具体方法是将Cu沉积在Pt(100)hex表面上，导致六角重建的局部提升，该过程被1 ML Cu完成。在550 K以下，Cu薄膜继续以自己的Cu(100)晶格参数生长。通过加热至650 K，可以制备具有c(2 X 2)对称性的有序Cu3Pt表面合金，其终止面为纯Cu。在650至750 K之间，表面合金发生相变，但无法清楚地区分(2 x 1)结构的CuPt合金相或导致p(2 X 2)LEED图案的CusPt 3相。对于所有这些临界合金相，都发现了纯Cu终止面。在950 K以上，Cu向Pt基质扩散，而在1000 K以上，恢复了纯Pt(100)hex结构。
