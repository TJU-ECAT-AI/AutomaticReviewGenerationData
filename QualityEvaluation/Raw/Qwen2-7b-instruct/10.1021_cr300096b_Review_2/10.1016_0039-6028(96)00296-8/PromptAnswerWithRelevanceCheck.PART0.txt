[1] "Cu was evaporated at 300 K onto the Pt(100)hex surface."
[2] "After the deposition the sample was annealed to 500 K in order to heal out defects."
[3] "Up to this temperature no hints for segregation of Pt into the Cu film was found."
[4] "This lattice constant is typical for Cu, and shows that (beyond the second monolayer) Cu continues to grow with its own lattice constant."
[5] "In order to lift the Pt reconstruction by adsorbing hydrogen at 100 K and short annealing to 300 K."
[6] "Additional annealing leads to the desorption of part of this hydrogen and in a characterization with PAX a Xe-induced 5Pl/2 photoemission peak between 6.0 and 6.1 eV (below Fermi energy) is typical for this system."
[7] "Therefore, with PAX it is possible to distinguish, whether the reconstruction of the bare Pt patches is also lifted submonolayer amounts of Cu (prior to H 2 adsorption) or by the post-adsorption of hydrogen."
[8] "These results are in accordance with the measure- ments of Yeates et al., who also found a diffusion of Cu into the Pt bulk for temperature higher than 500 K for Cu/Pt(111)."
[9] "Only above 900 K Pt atoms diffuse to the topmost layer and at 1000 K a nearly pure Pt surface is observed."
[10] "By further annealing up to 750 K half-order spots appear in the LEED pattern while at the same temperatures the central spot of the c(2 × 2) structure loses intensity."
[11] "The first monolayer is again pure Cu."
[12] "For both possible structures of the alloy produced at 750 K calculation of the normalized Pt intensity from all layers measured by AES using the Lambert-Beer law gives nearly the same value,which shows, that AES alone cannot distinguish."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. It enables researchers to examine how the properties of Ni and Pt interact and influence each other, which is fundamental to advanced surface science and catalysis research. The annealing process helps in healing out defects and allows for the study of the diffusion of elements between the two metals. The use of techniques such as AES, LEED, and PAX provides insights into the surface structure, composition, and behavior of these bimetallic systems under different conditions. The ability to distinguish between different structures, such as a (2 × 1) and a p(2 × 2) superstructures, is critical for accurate modeling and interpretation of the experimental data.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。它使研究人员能够研究Ni和Pt之间的性质如何相互作用并影响彼此，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究是基础性的。退火过程有助于修复缺陷，并允许研究两种金属之间的元素扩散情况。使用AES、LEED和PAX等技术提供了关于这些双金属体系在不同条件下的表面结构、组成和行为的见解。能够区分不同的结构，如(2 × 1)和p(2 × 2)超结构，对于准确建模和解释实验数据至关重要。

[1] "Cu was evaporated at 300 K onto the Pt(100)hex surface."
[2] "The beam energy was 115 eV for the first three patterns, 100 eV for the 3 ML Cu/(Pt(100)hex pattern."
[3] "An important question concerns the structure of the Cu-free Pt areas for submonolayer Cu coverages."
[4] "In the literature a geometrical argument for the lifting of the reconstruction is given by Sachtler et al. in the case of Au/Pt(100) [6]."
[5] "In agreement with earlier publications [8] Scheffler et al. suggest an electronic explanation for the reconstruction of the Pt(100) surface [11]."
[6] "By contrast, on the (100) surface we found no Pt in the topmost layer up to temperatures of 900 K using PAX intensities as a titration for the various surface sites."
[7] "The results, however, differ for the resultant topmost layer. For the (111) surface Yeates et al. found Pt in the topmost layer for all annealing temperatures above 500 K as demonstrated by CO-TDS experiments."
[8] "These results of chemical analysis show that Pt atoms migrate into the Cu overlayer at temperatures higher than 550 K, but the produced alloy films remain Cu-terminated up to 900 K."
[9] "By further annealing up to 750 K half-order spots appear in the LEED pattern while at the same temperatures the central spot of the c(2 × 2) structure loses intensity."
[10] "This new structure arises either from a (2 × 1) pattern in two domains or a p(2 × 2) structure. At present, it is not possible to distinguish clearly between these two structures because the observed very low intensity of the central spot - differentiating between the (2)< 1) and p(2×2) structures - could also be caused by small remaining areas of the c(2 × 2) alloy."
[11] "Another possibility to explain this behaviour of the central spot is a mixture of both new possible structures on the surface: the (2 X 1) and the p(2 × 2). Further experiments are necessary to explain this complex behaviour of the surface alloy prepared at 750 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The specific method described in the literature is Cu deposition on a Pt(100)hex surface leading to a local lifting of the hexagonal reconstruction, which is completed by a 1 ML Cu. Below 550 K, the Cu film continues to grow with its own lattice parameter. With annealing to 650 K, an ordered Cu3Pt surface alloy with a c(2 X 2) symmetry and a pure Cu termination could be prepared. Between 650 and 750 K, a phase transition occurs within the surface alloy, but it is not possible to distinguish clearly between a CuPt alloy phase with (2 x 1) structure or a CusPt 3 phase leading to a p(2 X 2) LEED pattern. For all these metastable alloy phases, a pure Cu termination was found. Above 950 K, Cu diffuses into the Pt bulk, and above 1000 K, the pure Pt(100)hex structure is restored.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。文献中描述的具体方法是将Cu沉积在Pt(100)hex表面上，导致六角重建的局部提升，该过程被1 ML Cu完成。在550 K以下，Cu薄膜继续以自己的Cu(100)晶格参数生长。通过加热至650 K，可以制备具有c(2 X 2)对称性的有序Cu3Pt表面合金，其终止面为纯Cu。在650至750 K之间，表面合金发生相变，但无法清楚地区分(2 x 1)结构的CuPt合金相或导致p(2 X 2)LEED图案的CusPt 3相。对于所有这些临界合金相，都发现了纯Cu终止面。在950 K以上，Cu向Pt基质扩散，而在1000 K以上，恢复了纯Pt(100)hex结构。

Cu films on Pt(100)hex are characterized by growing with a Cu(100) lattice parameter below 550 K. An ordered Cu3Pt surface alloy with a c(2 × 2) symmetry is prepared at 650 K. A phase transition occurs between 650 and 750 K within the surface alloy, which could be either a (2 × 1) or p(2 × 2) structure. Cu disappears into the bulk of Pt above 950 K, restoring the pure Pt(100)hex structure above 1000 K. All these phases exhibit a pure Cu termination.

在300 K下，Cu蒸发到Pt(100)hex表面上。Cu薄膜在低于550 K时以自己的Cu(100)晶格参数生长。在650 K时，制备出具有c(2 × 2)对称性的有序Cu3Pt表面合金。在650至750 K之间，表面合金发生相变，这可能是(2 × 1)或p(2 × 2)结构。当温度高于950 K时，Cu扩散进入Pt内部，并且当温度高于1000 K时，恢复纯Pt(100)hex结构。所有这些相都表现出纯Cu终止状态。

The characterization includes techniques like LEED, AES, and PAX to analyze the structure and composition of the surface alloys. The annealing process facilitates the diffusion of Cu into the Pt bulk, and above 900 K, a nearly pure Pt surface is observed. The use of these techniques provides insights into the interactions between Ni and Pt at the atomic level, contributing to the development of catalysts and materials with enhanced functionalities.
