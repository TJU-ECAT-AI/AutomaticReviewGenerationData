The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through SXPS studies. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. SXPS provides insights into interfacial properties and thermal stability of the monolayer films, indicating that single monolayer films of metals causing faceting remain stable and do not form alloys until multilayer films are deposited. Core level shifts observed for both overlayer and substrate films indicate the presence of surface alloys, which have implications for surface reactivity.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，通过在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基体上沉积Ni单层进行。这一过程对于理解高级表面科学和催化研究中这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。SXPS研究提供了界面性质的重要见解，并表明导致成核的单层金属薄膜在高温下保持稳定，不会形成合金直到多层薄膜沉积。观察到的外层和基质薄膜的核壳层位移表明存在表面合金，这对表面反应性有影响。
