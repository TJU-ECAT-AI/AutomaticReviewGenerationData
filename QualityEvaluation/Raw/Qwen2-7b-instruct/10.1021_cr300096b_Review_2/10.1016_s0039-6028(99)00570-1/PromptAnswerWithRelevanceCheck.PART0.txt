[1] "In the present work, we focus on the structure, electronic properties and reactivity of planar and faceted W(111) and W(211) covered by ultrathin films of metals (mainly Pd, Rh, Pt, Au) and non-metals (S, O)."
[2] "We have chosen to investigate acetylene surface chemistry on PdW bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "Our first experiments were on clean and carbide-modified W(211) surfaces: we find that acetylene does not cyclotrimerize to form benzene, as revealed by comparing HREELS and TPD studies of acetylene and benzene on the two surfaces."
[4] "In the cases of Pt and Ir, evidence for alloy film formation is seen from 4f7/2 core level shifts for both overlayer and substrate."

1. The structure, electronic properties, and reactivity of planar and faceted tungsten surfaces covered by ultrathin films of metals and non-metals are the primary focus of the current research.

2. The surface chemistry of acetylene on bimetallic tungsten surfaces, specifically on PdW surfaces, is being studied.

3. On clean and carbide-modified tungsten(211) surfaces, acetylene does not cyclotrimerize to form benzene. This is determined through comparisons of HREELS and TPD studies on both types of surfaces.

4. For platinum and iridium, there is evidence of alloy film formation observable through shifts in the 4f7/2 core levels for both the overlayer and substrate.

[1] "First-principles calculations (local density formalism with generalized gradient approximation, LDA-GGA) have been used to show that the coexistence of two types of pyramidal facet is consistent with energetic considerations."
[2] "The fact that the (211) and (110) values are both lower than the (111) value at 1 ML Pd implies that the {211} and {110} facets are both thermodynamically allowed, but that {211} is more stable than {110}."
[3] "Careful TPD measurements are to ascertain the binding energy differences between metalW(211) and metalW(111), which may provide insights into the large surface free energy anisotropy of these systems."
[4] "The SXPS studies of bimetallic systems have provided important insights into interfacial properties."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through SXPS studies. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. SXPS provides insights into interfacial properties and thermal stability of the monolayer films, indicating that single monolayer films of metals causing faceting remain stable and do not form alloys until multilayer films are deposited. Core level shifts observed for both overlayer and substrate films indicate the presence of surface alloys, which have implications for surface reactivity.
