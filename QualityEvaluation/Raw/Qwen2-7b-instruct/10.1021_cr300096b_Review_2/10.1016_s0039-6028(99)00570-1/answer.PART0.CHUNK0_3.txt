[1] "In the present work, we focus on the structure, electronic properties and reactivity of planar and faceted W(111) and W(211) covered by ultrathin films of metals (mainly Pd, Rh, Pt, Au) and non-metals (S, O)."
[2] "The measurements include ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy, soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS) using synchrotron radiation, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, low-energy electron microscopy, and thermal desorption spectroscopy."
[3] "The metal film growth and thermal stability have been investigated for coverages of 08 ML."
[4] "In the present paper, we summarize recent results that provide new insights into the morphological stability of film-covered W surfaces. We focus on three main aspects of the studies: surface structure and morphology, surface chemistry, and surface electronic properties."
[5] "In brief, W(111) and Mo(111) coated with a single physical monolayer (ML) of certain metals or other elements (Pd, Rh, Ir, Pt, Au, O) undergo massive reconstruction from a planar morphology to a microscopically faceted surface upon heating to T>700 K."
[6] "The faceting transition in these systems is believed to be thermodynamically driven but kinetically limited: annealing is needed to achieve sufficient surface atom mobility for mass transport."
[7] "At coverages above 1 ML, SXPS data indicate that thin film alloys are formed upon annealing films of Pt and Pd; surface alloy formation is not seen for Au films."
[8] "These findings are discussed in terms of structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces. The surfaces are studied using ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy, soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS) using synchrotron radiation, Auger electron spectroscopy, low-energy electron diffraction, low-energy electron microscopy, and thermal desorption spectroscopy. The focus is on the structure, electronic properties, and reactivity of planar and faceted W(111) and W(211) covered by ultrathin films of metals and non-metals. The thermal stability of metal films is also investigated for coverages ranging from 0 to 8 ML. Surface alloy formation is observed for Pt and Pd films but not for Au films. The findings contribute to insights into the structural and electronic properties of bimetallic systems.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt(111)或聚晶Pt基片上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于理解这些表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。通过超真空扫描隧道显微镜、软X射线光电子能谱（使用同步辐射）、俄歇电子能谱、低能电子衍射、低能电子显微镜和热脱附光谱来研究这些表面。研究重点是分析覆盖有金属或非金属（如Pd、Rh、Ir、Pt、Au、O）的平滑和晶面化的W(111)和W(211)表面的结构、电子特性和反应性。对金属薄膜的热稳定性也进行了调查，覆盖范围从0到8 ML不等。发现Pt和Pd薄膜会形成表面合金，而Au薄膜不会。这些发现为理解双金属系统的结构和电子性质提供了见解。
