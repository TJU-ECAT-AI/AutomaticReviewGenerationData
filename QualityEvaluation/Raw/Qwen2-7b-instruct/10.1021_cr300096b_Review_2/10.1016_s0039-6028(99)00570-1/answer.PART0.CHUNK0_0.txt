[1] "In the present work, we focus on the structure, electronic properties and reactivity of planar and faceted W(111) and W(211) covered by ultrathin films of metals (mainly Pd, Rh, Pt, Au) and non-metals (S, O)."
[2] "We have chosen to investigate acetylene surface chemistry on PdW bimetallic surfaces."
[3] "Our first experiments were on clean and carbide-modified W(211) surfaces: we find that acetylene does not cyclotrimerize to form benzene, as revealed by comparing HREELS and TPD studies of acetylene and benzene on the two surfaces."
[4] "In the cases of Pt and Ir, evidence for alloy film formation is seen from 4f7/2 core level shifts for both overlayer and substrate."

1. The structure, electronic properties, and reactivity of planar and faceted tungsten surfaces covered by ultrathin films of metals and non-metals are the primary focus of the current research.

2. The surface chemistry of acetylene on bimetallic tungsten surfaces, specifically on PdW surfaces, is being studied.

3. On clean and carbide-modified tungsten(211) surfaces, acetylene does not cyclotrimerize to form benzene. This is determined through comparisons of HREELS and TPD studies on both types of surfaces.

4. For platinum and iridium, there is evidence of alloy film formation observable through shifts in the 4f7/2 core levels for both the overlayer and substrate.

1. 当前研究的主要关注点是覆盖有金属和非金属的平面和微晶钨表面的结构、电子特性和反应性。

2. 正在研究乙炔在双金属钨表面（特别是钯钨表面）的表面化学特性。

3. 在清洁和碳化物修饰的钨（211）表面上，乙炔不会异聚化形成苯。通过在两种类型表面上的HREELS和TPD研究的比较得出这一结论。

4. 对于铂和铱，从覆盖层和基底的4f7/2核心能级的偏移中可以看到合金薄膜的形成证据。
