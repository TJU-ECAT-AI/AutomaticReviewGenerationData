1.First-principles calculations have shown that the coexistence of two types of pyramidal facets on the PdW(111) surface is energetically consistent. 

2.At a coverage of 1 ML Pd, the (211) and (110) facet energies are lower than the (111) value, suggesting that both are thermodynamically allowed, with {211} being more stable.

3.TPD measurements aim to determine the binding energy differences between metals on W(211) and W(111), offering insights into the large surface free energy anisotropy.

4.SXPS studies have provided valuable information on the interfacial properties of bimetallic systems.

1.第一原理计算表明，PdW(111)表面两种类型的金字塔晶面共存在能态上是符合能量考虑的。

2.在1 ML Pd覆盖下，(211)和(110)晶面的能量低于(111)，这表明这两种晶面都是热力学允许的，但{211}更稳定。

3.TPD测量旨在确定金属在W(211)和W(111)上的结合能差异，提供对这些系统大表面自由能各向异性的重要见解。

4.SXPS研究提供了双金属体系界面性质的重要信息。
