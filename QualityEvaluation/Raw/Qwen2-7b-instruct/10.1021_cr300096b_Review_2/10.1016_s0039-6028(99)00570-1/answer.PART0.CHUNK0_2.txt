[1] "In contrast to atomically smooth, close-packed substrates that comprise the majority of published studies on model thin film metal-on-metal systems [9] ,[10] ,[11] ,[12] ,[13] ,[14] , bcc (111) substrates represent atomically rough, morphologically unstable surfaces."
[2] "The SXPS data indicate that thin film alloys are formed upon annealing films of Pt and Pd; surface alloy formation is not seen for Au films."
[3] "The SXPS studies of bimetallic systems have provided important insights into interfacial properties."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise manipulation of the interface between the two metals, enabling detailed examination of their interactions and properties.
