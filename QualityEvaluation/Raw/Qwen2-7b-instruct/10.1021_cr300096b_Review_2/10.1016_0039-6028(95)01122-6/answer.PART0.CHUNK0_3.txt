[1] "Recently 50%Pt50%Ni alloys have shown an important decrease in the chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydro- carbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt or Ni."
[2] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer."
[3] "In Table 1 are collected the Eaa values obtained for a H atom adsorbed on top (T), bridge (B), hollow octahedral (Ho) and hollow tetrahedral (Ht) sites of Ni(111), Pt(111), and Pt/Ni(111)."
[4] "Our computations for Pt/Ni(111) show an impor- tant decrease of Ead, in comparison with the atomic adsorption on the pure metals."
[5] "The only remaining interac- tion between the two H atoms is repulsive so that they are about 0.1-0.2 . outside from the adsorption site of the monoatomic case."
[6] "In the case of the hydrogen atom, the vari- ous adsorption sites give almost similar adsorption energies, with decreasing absolute values with re- spect to Pt(111)."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces because it allows for precise control over the interface structure, enabling detailed analysis of the interactions and properties at the metal-metal contact. This approach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic and chemisorptive behaviors of bimetallic systems in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
