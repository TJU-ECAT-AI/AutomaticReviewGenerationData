[1] "Recently 50%Pt50%Ni alloys have shown an important decrease in the chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydro-carbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt or Ni."
[2] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer."
[3] "Our interest was to obtain the equilibrium state parameters and the electronic structure for mono-atomic and molecular hydrogen adsorption on the Pt(monolayer)/Ni(lll) system."
[4] "In the case of H2 molecular adsorption, the molecule was supposed to arrive along a trajectory normally to a top site, with its internuclear axis parallel to the surface."
[5] "This points out that the chemical properties of the Pt surface layer are largely dependent on the Pt-Pt overlap mediated by geometrical parameters."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves synthesizing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structuring models, performing DFT calculations, and comprehensively understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces within the realms of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces through depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) surfaces creates an interesting analogy to the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys, offering insights into the unique properties of these bimetallic interfaces.
3. The study aimed to ascertain the equilibrium state parameters and the electronic structure associated with hydrogen adsorption on the Pt/Ni(111) system, comparing it with the monometallic cases of H/Pt(111) and H/Ni(111).
4. During the simulation of hydrogen molecule adsorption, the researchers assumed the molecule would arrive perpendicularly at a top site, with its internuclear axis aligned with the surface.
5. The dependence of the chemical properties of the Pt surface layer on the Pt-Pt overlap, influenced by geometrical parameters, underscores the importance of structural considerations in understanding bimetallic surface chemistry.
