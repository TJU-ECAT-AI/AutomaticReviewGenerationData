[1] "Recently 50%Pt50%Ni alloys have shown an important decrease in the chemisorption strength for molecular H and hydro- carbons like benzene [1] in comparison with pure Pt or Ni."
[2] "An interesting analogue of the quasi-pure Pt surface of PtNi alloys can be seen in Ni(111) covered with a Pt monolayer."
[3] "Our interest was to obtain the equilibrium state parameters and the electronic structure for mono- atomic and molecular hydrogen adsorption on the Pt(monolayer)/Ni(lll) system."
[4] "The metallic substrate was represented by a four layers cluster."
[5] "In the bimetallic case, the overall adiabatic energy profile is less stable in comparison with Pt(111)."
[6] "This points out that the chemical properties of the Pt surface layer are largely dependent on the Pt-Pt overlap mediated by geometrical parameters."

1. The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for creating surfaces that can exhibit distinct electronic and chemical properties compared to their individual metal components. This is important for understanding the behavior of these surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. Structural modeling, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and the comprehensive understanding of electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces rely heavily on the accurate characterization of these surfaces. By synthesizing Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, researchers can study how the properties of one metal influence the other within the bimetallic structure, providing insights into the unique functionalities these surfaces can offer in catalytic processes.
