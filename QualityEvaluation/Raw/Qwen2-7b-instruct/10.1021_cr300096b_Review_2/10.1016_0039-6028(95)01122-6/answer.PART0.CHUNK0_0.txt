[1] "An extended Huckel molecular orbital method was used to determine minimum energies and equilibrium interatomic distances."
[2] "In the bimetallic case, the overall adiabatic energy profile is less stable in comparison with Pt(111)."
[3] "This points out that the chemical properties of the Pt surface layer are largely dependent on the Pt-Pt overlap mediated by geometrical parameters."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves utilizing an extended Huckel molecular orbital method to ascertain the minimum energies and equilibrium interatomic distances. This process is crucial because it allows for the determination of the stability of the bimetallic system compared to the pure metal components. The electronic and geometric structures of the overlayer significantly influence the chemical properties of the Pt surface layer, primarily through the Pt-Pt overlap mediated by geometrical parameters.

对由在单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面进行表征，使用扩展的Huckel分子轨道方法来确定最小能量和平衡原子间距离。这一过程至关重要，因为它允许确定双金属体系相对于纯金属成分的稳定性。过层层的电子和几何结构显著影响Pt表面层的化学性质，主要通过介导几何参数的Pt-Pt重叠实现。
