[1] "An extended Huckel molecular orbital method was used to determine minimum energies and equilibrium interatomic distances."
[2] "The adsorption energy Ead was calculated as Ead = AE e + _,E r + UAQ,where A E e is the total valence electron energy taken as a difference with respect to the adatom (or adatoms) at infinity, EE r is the sum of the repulsive interaction energies between screened cores of H and substrate atoms [6] and UAQ is a repulsive electron-electron Coulombic energy due to the excess negative charge accumulated on the H atom [7]."
[3] "The electronic structure was analyzed in terms of the atomic local density of states (LDOS) [8] for H and substrate atoms."
[4] "In the case of H z molecular adsorption, the molecule was supposed to arrive along a trajectory normally to a top site, with its internuclear axis parallel to the surface."
[5] "For smaller H2-M distances, the H atoms could find again equilibrium positions in the neighbourhood of two contiguous 3-fold sites and the molecule would be clearly dissociated."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves synthesizing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to accurately understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The method employs an extended Huckel molecular orbital approach to calculate minimum energies and equilibrium interatomic distances. Adsorption energies are determined through a formula incorporating total valence electron energy, repulsive interaction energies between hydrogen and substrate atoms, and a repulsive electron-electron Coulombic energy due to the excess negative charge on the hydrogen atom. The electronic structure is analyzed using atomic local density of states (LDOS) for hydrogen and substrate atoms. The adsorption process considers the trajectory of the hydrogen molecule arriving along a normal to a top site, with its internuclear axis parallel to the surface. For smaller hydrogen-metal distances, hydrogen atoms can find equilibrium positions near two contiguous 3-fold sites, leading to clear dissociation of the molecule.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt（111）单晶或聚晶Pt基底上合成Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它允许研究人员准确理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下的电子和化学性质。采用扩展Huckel分子轨道方法来计算最小能量和平衡原子间距离。通过一个公式确定吸附能，该公式包含总价电子能量、氢和基体原子之间的排斥相互作用能量以及由于氢原子上累积的过剩负电荷而产生的排斥电子-电子库仑能。电子结构通过原子局部密度状态（LDOS）进行分析，用于氢和基体原子。吸附过程考虑氢分子沿着垂直于顶部位置的轨迹到达，并且其核间距轴平行于表面。对于更小的氢-金属距离，氢原子可以找到靠近两个相邻的3-重键位置的平衡位置，导致分子清晰分解。
