2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces
"In this section we will illustrate the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces following the deposition of one monolayer of Ni on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate."
"For example, Figure 3 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPtPt(111) surface to 900 K."
"The characterization following annealing to 600-640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later."
"In addition to the examples given above, many UHV techniques have been utilized to characterize the surface structures of several bimetallic systems."

2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces

For the LEIS experiments (Figure 3a), Ni was deposited at 300 K and the initial coverage of Ni was 1 ML. After a small initial increase in the Ni intensity, possibly due to desorption of contaminant H2, the Ni intensity decreased significantly with increasing temperature until it became nearly undetectable by 800 K. There were corresponding increases in the Pt intensity as the annealing temperature increased. 

Similar trends were observed in the AES experiments (Figure 3b), which were performed at three different initial coverages. The Ni/Pt AES ratio underwent significant decreases at above 700 K, indicating the diffusion of Ni into regions that were beyond the detection limit of the AES measurements. 

The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 3c, after deposition at 300 K, Ni atoms formed islands that were a single atomic layer thick and nucleated at the step edges of the Pt(111) surface. Upon annealing to 640 K, all of the island features disappeared, as shown in Figure 3d. The surface appeared fairly uniform, with many small, wormlike features, which were attributed to the strain caused by the subsurface Ni atoms in Pt(111).

Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K. The characterization following annealing to 600640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later.

In practice, bimetallic catalysts are often supported nanoparticles of varying shape and size. Polycrystalline bimetallic films provide a potential way to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts. As illustrated in Figure 4, it is reasonable to assume that the surface chemistry of the nanoparticle should be dominated primarily by the first few atomic layers. It is also reasonable to assume that the chemistry of the individual crystal facets on the nanoparticle (primarily (111) and (100) for a face-centered cubic (fcc) nanoparticle) can be approximated by their respective single-crystal extensions. With these assumptions, Menning and Chen deposited Ni on a polycrystalline Pt film that contained mainly the (111) and (100) facets to mimic supported bimetallic particles. 

Similar to Pt(111), monolayer Ni was deposited on the polycrystalline Pt foil at room temperature to produce the NiPtPt surface structure, followed by annealing to higher temperatures to obtain the PtNiPt subsurface structure. More about the similar catalytic properties between single-crystal PtNiPt(111), polycrystalline PtNiPt, and supported PtNi catalysts will be illustrated later.

In addition to the examples given above, many UHV techniques have been utilized to characterize the surface structures of several bimetallic systems. Table 1 provides a list of selected bimetallic surfaces, along with the corresponding UHV techniques or theoretical calculations used to characterize the surface properties.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. This process is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for the creation of structural models suitable for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Secondly, it helps correlate the bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of the surfaces. The use of techniques such as Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Leidenfrost Ion Scattering Spectroscopy (LEIS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) provides detailed insights into the surface properties. The trends observed in these techniques, such as the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111) upon annealing, contribute to a deeper understanding of the surface chemistry and its implications for catalytic activity. This knowledge is essential for advancing the field of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
