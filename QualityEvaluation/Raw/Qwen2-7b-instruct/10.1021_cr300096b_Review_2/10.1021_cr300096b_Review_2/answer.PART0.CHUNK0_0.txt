2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces
"In this section we will illustrate the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces following the deposition of one monolayer of Ni on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate."
"For example, Figure 3 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPtPt(111) surface to 900 K."
"The characterization following annealing to 600-640 K was consistent with the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt(111); the possibility of the production of the PtNiPt(111) structure, with Ni atoms staying directly underneath the surface Pt, was further suggested from DFT calculations and experimental measurements of chemical properties, as described later."
"In addition to the examples given above, many UHV techniques have been utilized to characterize the surface structures of several bimetallic systems."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it provides a clear model of the surface structure. It is also essential for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, as demonstrated through various techniques such as AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM. The results obtained help correlate the bimetallic structures with their properties, which is vital for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
