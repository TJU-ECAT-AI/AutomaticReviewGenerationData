2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces
In this section we will illustrate the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces following the deposition of one monolayer of Ni on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate.
The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations. It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces.
For example, Figure 3 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPtPt(111) surface to 900 K.
The STM images provided further characterization of the 300 and 640 K Ni/Pt(111) surfaces.
Overall, the AES, LEIS, XPS, and STM results confirmed the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after the deposition of Ni at 300 K.
In practice, bimetallic catalysts are often supported nanoparticles of varying shape and size. Polycrystalline bimetallic films provide a potential way to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal surfaces and supported catalysts.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. This process is crucial for providing structural models for Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and correlating bimetallic structures with their electronic and chemical properties. Techniques such as Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), Low Energy Ion Scattering (LEIS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) are employed to confirm the presence of a surface Ni monolayer on Pt(111) after Ni deposition. These characterizations help in understanding the behavior of bimetallic catalysts in various applications.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni。这一过程对于为密度泛函理论（DFT）计算提供结构模型以及将双金属结构与它们的电子和化学性质相关联至关重要。使用技术如Auger电子能谱（AES）、低能离子散射（LEIS）、X射线光电子能谱（XPS）和扫描隧道显微镜（STM）来确认在300K时Ni沉积在Pt(111)上的表面Ni单层的存在。这些表征有助于理解不同应用中双金属催化剂的行为。
