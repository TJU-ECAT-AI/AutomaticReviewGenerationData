2.1.3 Example: Characterization of Ni/Pt Bimetallic Surfaces
"In this section we will illustrate the synthesis and characterization of bimetallic surfaces following the deposition of one monolayer of Ni on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate."
"For example, Figure 3 shows the LEIS and AES results following the annealing of the 300 K NiPtPt(111) surface to 900 K."
"The characterization of Ni/Pt(111) bimetallic surfaces is very useful in providing structural models for DFT calculations."
"It is also critical in correlating bimetallic structures with the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on either a Pt(111) single crystal or a polycrystalline Pt substrate. This process includes utilizing techniques such as AES and LEIS. The annealing of the surface to high temperatures helps in understanding the diffusion of Ni into the subsurface region of Pt. The characterization is crucial for providing structural models for DFT calculations and correlating the bimetallic structures with their electronic and chemical properties.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基质上沉积一层Ni单层。此过程包括使用AES和LEIS等技术。对表面进行高温退火有助于理解Ni向Pt的亚表面区域的扩散。这一表征对于提供DFT计算的结构模型以及将双金属结构与它们的电子和化学性质相关联至关重要。
