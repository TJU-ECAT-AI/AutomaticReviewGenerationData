Chemisorption and Catalytic Properties of Supported Platinum
J. A. CUSUMANO, G. W. DEMBINSKI, AND J. H. SINFELT

EXPERIMENTAL
The platinum catalysts used in this work were prepared by impregnation of alumina or silica-alumina with aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by drying and subsequent calcination in air for 1 hr at 540C.

I:ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Adsorption isotherms for hydrogen on the platinum catalysts and supports are shown in Fig. 1. In obtaining the isotherms, ap- proximately 30 rain was allowed before an equilibrium pressure reading was taken.

In the case of the silica-alumina and plati- num-on-silica-alumina samples, the adsorp- tion on the former is only about 15% of that on the latter at a pressure of 2 cm, but increases to about 50% at a pressure of 20 era.

When the adsorption isotherms for the platinum catalysts are corrected for adsorp- tion on the supports, net isotherms for ad- sorption on the platinum itself are obtained.

Adopting this procedure and expressing the results as atoms of hydrogen adsorbed per atom of platinum, we obtain the isotherms shown in Fig. 2.

In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydro- gen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum.

The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydro- genation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1.

The rates of dehydrogenation were deter- mined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quan- tity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of eyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams. The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina.

The results of the present investigation indicate that the support did not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic prop- erties of the platinum, but instead simply affected the degree of platinum dispersion.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control and examination of the interface between the two metals. The deposition of the Ni monolayer on the Pt substrate enables researchers to analyze how the presence of one metal affects the properties of the other, particularly at the atomic level. This detailed understanding is essential for optimizing the performance of catalysts and predicting their behavior in various applications.
