[1] "The results of the present investigation indicate that the support did not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties of the platinum, but instead simply affected the degree of platinum dispersion."
[2] "In other words, the specific catalytic activity of the platinum (rate per unit platinum surface area) for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a process crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. This process allows researchers to assess how the properties of the bimetallic surfaces change with the support used, providing insights into the interaction between the metals and their surroundings. In the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research, understanding these interactions is essential for developing materials with enhanced catalytic performance.
