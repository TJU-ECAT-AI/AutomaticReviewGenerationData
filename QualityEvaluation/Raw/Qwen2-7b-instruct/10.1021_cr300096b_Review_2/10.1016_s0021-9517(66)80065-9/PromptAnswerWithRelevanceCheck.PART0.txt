JOUENAL OF CATALYSIS 5, 471"-475 (1966)

The chemisorption results indicated that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. The higher activity of the platinum on alumina for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is attributed to the greater platinum dispersion.

The adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole.

The adsorption on the alumina, at either 200 or 300C, is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on:alumina catalyst. The adsorption on the alumina is also seen to increase with increasing temperature.

When the adsorption isotherms for the platinum catalysts are corrected for adsorption on the supports, net isotherms for adsorption on the platinum itself are obtained.

Adopting this procedure and expressing the results as atoms of hydrogen adsorbed per atom of platinum, we obtain the isotherms shown in Fig. 2. In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydrogen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum.

In the case of the platinum-on-silica-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum is about an order of magnitude less than for the platinum-on-alumina catalyst. The dispersion of the platinum is therefore much poorer on silica-alumina than on alumina, i.e., the platinum surface area is about one-tenth as great on silica-alumina as on alumina.

The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves assessing the dispersion and distribution of the Ni layer on the Pt substrate. This process is crucial for structural modeling because it allows researchers to understand the precise arrangement of atoms in the bimetallic structure. By examining the surface chemistry and electronic properties of these bimetallic surfaces, scientists can predict how the materials will behave in various catalytic applications. DFT calculations often complement experimental observations by providing theoretical insights into the electronic interactions and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces. The comprehensive understanding gained from these studies enhances our ability to design and optimize catalysts for advanced surface science and catalysis research.

Chemisorption and Catalytic Properties of Supported Platinum
J. A. CUSUMANO, G. W. DEMBINSKI, AND J. H. SINFELT

EXPERIMENTAL
The platinum catalysts used in this work were prepared by impregnation of alumina or silica-alumina with aqueous chloroplatinic acid solution, followed by drying and subsequent calcination in air for 1 hr at 540C.

I:ESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Adsorption isotherms for hydrogen on the platinum catalysts and supports are shown in Fig. 1. In obtaining the isotherms, ap- proximately 30 rain was allowed before an equilibrium pressure reading was taken.

In the case of the silica-alumina and plati- num-on-silica-alumina samples, the adsorp- tion on the former is only about 15% of that on the latter at a pressure of 2 cm, but increases to about 50% at a pressure of 20 era.

When the adsorption isotherms for the platinum catalysts are corrected for adsorp- tion on the supports, net isotherms for ad- sorption on the platinum itself are obtained.

Adopting this procedure and expressing the results as atoms of hydrogen adsorbed per atom of platinum, we obtain the isotherms shown in Fig. 2.

In the case of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the number of hydro- gen atoms adsorbed per platinum atom is essentially unity, corresponding to a high degree of dispersion of platinum.

The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydro- genation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1.

The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina.

The results of the present investigation indicate that the support did not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic prop- erties of the platinum, but instead simply affected the degree of platinum dispersion.
