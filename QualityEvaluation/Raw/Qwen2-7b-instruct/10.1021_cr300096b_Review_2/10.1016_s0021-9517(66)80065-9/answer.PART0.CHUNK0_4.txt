[1] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts."
[2] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[3] "The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."
[4] "However, it is possible that the more active platinum-on-alumina catalyst may have been limited to some degree by pore diffusion, so that the factor of 6 may be smaller than the true ratio of catalytic activities."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to precisely control and analyze the structure and interactions of the bimetallic interfaces. By understanding these properties, scientists can optimize the performance of bimetallic catalysts for various applications, including hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, and other industrial processes.
