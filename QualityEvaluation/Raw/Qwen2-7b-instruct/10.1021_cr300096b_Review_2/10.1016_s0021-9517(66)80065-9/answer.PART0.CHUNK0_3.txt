[1] "The results of the present investigation indicate that the support did not exert any specific effect on the intrinsic catalytic properties of the platinum, but instead simply affected the degree of platinum dispersion."
[2] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the case of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."
[3] "In other words, the specific catalytic activity of the platinum (rate per unit platinum surface area) for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the bimetallic interface. The deposition of Ni on Pt creates a unique environment where the properties of both metals can be synergistically exploited, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity for specific reactions. By tuning the Ni/Pt ratio and the deposition conditions, scientists can optimize the bimetallic surface for desired catalytic applications, such as hydrogen production, CO oxidation, or selective synthesis of organic compounds.
