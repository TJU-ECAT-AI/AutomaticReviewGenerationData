The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves determining the concentration changes of Ni as a function of annealing temperature and time. This process is crucial for understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The formation of a Ni/Pt surface alloy at specific annealing temperatures, such as 575 K, indicates a mixture of Ni adatoms with the Pt substrate. The energy barrier for the surface atoms during alloy formation, obtained through kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, is 1.11"0.12 eVyatom.
