1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves the use of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This technique is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The process of forming a surface-confined Cu Pt (111) bilayer alloy is demonstrated through AES. The energy barrier for the interlayer mixing of this alloy is determined to be 1.11"0.12 eVyatom. This value is obtained by comparing experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations, providing insight into the kinetics of alloy formation.
3. Annealing temperatures significantly influence the rate of alloy formation. As the annealing temperature increases, the rate of mixing between the Cu and Pt layers accelerates, indicating a more rapid interdiffusion process.
4. To determine the diffusion barrier for the surface atoms during the alloy formation process, kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are employed. These simulations allow for the comparison of experimental data with theoretical models, ultimately leading to the identification of an energy barrier for the process of forming a bilayer confined surface alloy.
5. The energy barrier for the process of forming a bilayer confined surface alloy, specifically for the Cu Pt (111) system, is found to be 1.11"0.12 eVyatom. This value represents the minimum energy required for the Cu atoms to penetrate into the Pt(111) substrate and form a surface alloy.

1. Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基片上沉积Ni单层完成。这种技术对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质进行全面理解至关重要，尤其是在先进表面科学和催化研究领域。
2. Cu Pt（111）表面受限二层合金的形成过程通过原子发射光谱（AES）演示。该合金的层间混合的能量壁垒被确定为1.11"0.12 eVyatom。通过将实验数据与蒙特卡洛模拟进行比较，可以获得这一值，从而提供关于合金形成动力学的见解。
3. 退火温度显著影响合金形成的速度。随着退火温度的升高，Cu和Pt层之间的混合速率加快，表明了更快的互扩散过程。
4. 为了确定表面原子在合金形成过程中扩散的壁垒，使用了动力学蒙特卡洛（MC）模拟。这些模拟允许将实验数据与理论模型进行比较，最终确定了形成层受限表面合金的能量壁垒。
5. 形成层受限表面合金（尤其是Cu Pt（111）系统）的能量壁垒被确定为1.11"0.12 eVyatom。这个值代表了Cu原子穿透Pt(111)基体并形成表面合金所需的最小能量。
