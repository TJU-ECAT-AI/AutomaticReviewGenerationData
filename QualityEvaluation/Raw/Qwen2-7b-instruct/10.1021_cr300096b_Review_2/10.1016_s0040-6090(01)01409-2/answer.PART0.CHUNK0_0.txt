1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves the use of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). This technique is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.
2. The process of forming a surface-confined Cu Pt (111) bilayer alloy is demonstrated through AES. The energy barrier for the interlayer mixing of this alloy is determined to be 1.11"0.12 eVyatom. This value is obtained by comparing experimental data with Monte Carlo simulations, providing insight into the kinetics of alloy formation.
3. Annealing temperatures significantly influence the rate of alloy formation. As the annealing temperature increases, the rate of mixing between the Cu and Pt layers accelerates, indicating a more rapid interdiffusion process.
4. To determine the diffusion barrier for the surface atoms during the alloy formation process, kinetic Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are employed. These simulations allow for the comparison of experimental data with theoretical models, ultimately leading to the identification of an energy barrier for the process of forming a bilayer confined surface alloy.
5. The energy barrier for the process of forming a bilayer confined surface alloy, specifically for the Cu Pt (111) system, is found to be 1.11"0.12 eVyatom. This value represents the minimum energy required for the Cu atoms to penetrate into the Pt(111) substrate and form a surface alloy.
