The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to comprehensively understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The characterization typically includes the use of techniques such as symmetrized automated tensor low-energy electron diffraction (SATLEED) analysis and ab initio plane wave density functional calculations. These methods help in determining the structure of the surface alloys and comparing them with other similar systems, such as 0.5 ML Pd/Cu{100}.
