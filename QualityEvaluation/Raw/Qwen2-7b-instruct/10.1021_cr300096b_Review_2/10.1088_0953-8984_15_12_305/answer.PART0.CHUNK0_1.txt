[1] "The results are then compared with those for the similar system 0.5 ML Pd/Cu{100}."
[2] "The ordered mixed layer is found to be rippled by 0.08  0.06 Å with Pt atoms rippled outwards towards the solidvacuum interface."
[3] "A similar structure to the Pt/Cu{100} has been retrieved with slight differences in the interlayer spacings."
[4] "However, they reveal an interesting difference between the stability of the Pd and Pt systems and highlight the fact that the Pd/Cu structure is best thought of as a metastable structure occurring as an intermediate step in the diffusion of the transitional metal ion into the bulk of the Cu substrate."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces comprehensively. The results obtained from this process are compared with similar systems to analyze the differences and similarities in their interlayer spacings and stability. This method helps in identifying the metastable structure of the Pd/Cu system, which occurs during the diffusion of the transition metal ion into the bulk of the Cu substrate.

Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征方法涉及在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模和第一性原理计算至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质。从这个过程中得到的结果与类似的系统进行比较，以分析它们之间的层间距差异和稳定性。这种方法有助于识别Pd/Cu系统的准稳定结构，该结构发生在过渡金属离子向Cu基体内部扩散的过程中。
