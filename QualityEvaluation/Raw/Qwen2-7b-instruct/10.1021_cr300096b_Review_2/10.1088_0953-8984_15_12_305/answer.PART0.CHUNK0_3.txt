The characterization of Cu-capped Pt/Cu{100} surface alloys involves depositing a 0.5 monolayer of Pt on Cu{100} followed by annealing to 525 K, leading to a c(2 × 2) LEED pattern. Symmetrized automated tensor low-energy electron diffraction (SATLEED) analysis and ab initio plane wave density functional calculations are used to determine the structure. These methods provide insights into the electronic and chemical properties of the bimetallic surfaces, crucial for advanced surface science and catalysis research.
