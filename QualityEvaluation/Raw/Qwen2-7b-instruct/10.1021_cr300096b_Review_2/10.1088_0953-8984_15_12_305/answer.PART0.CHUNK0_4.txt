[1] "The results are then compared with those for the similar system 0.5 ML Pd/Cu{100}."
[2] "A recent quantitative SATLEED analysis for 0.5 ML Pd/Cu{100} was performed in an earlier study (Barnes et al 2001 Surf. Sci. 492 55)."
[3] "A similar structure to the Pt/Cu{100} has been retrieved with slight differences in the interlayer spacings."
[4] "The ab initio density functional results are fully consistent with the experimentally determined structures."
[5] "However, they reveal an interesting difference between the stability of the Pd and Pt systems and highlight the fact that the Pd/Cu structure is best thought of as a metastable structure occurring as an intermediate step in the diffusion of the transitional metal ion into the bulk of the Cu substrate."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. By comparing the results with similar systems, such as 0.5 ML Pd/Cu{100}, researchers can identify similarities and differences in the interlayer spacings and structures. The ab initio density functional calculations confirm the experimental findings, providing insights into the stability of the Pd and Pt systems. Moreover, the Pd/Cu structure is considered metastable, serving as an intermediate step in the diffusion of the transition metal ion into the bulk of the Cu substrate.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基底上沉积Ni单层。这一过程对于结构建模、第一性原理计算以及理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。通过与类似系统（如0.5 ML Pd/Cu{100}）的结果进行比较，研究者可以识别相似性和差异，包括层间间距和结构。第一性原理密度泛函计算证实了实验结果，提供了Pd和Pt系统稳定性的见解。此外，Pd/Cu结构被视为过渡金属离子扩散到Cu基体内部的中间步骤，被认为是不稳定的状态。
