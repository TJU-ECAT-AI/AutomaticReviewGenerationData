The characterization of the Cu-capped surface alloy of Pt/Cu{100} involves depositing a 0.5 monolayer of Pt on Cu{100}, followed by annealing to 525 K, which results in a sharp c(2 × 2) LEED pattern. The structure is further analyzed using SATLEED and ab initio plane wave density functional calculations. The results indicate that the surface alloy comprises an ordered c(2 × 2) CuPt second layer alloy capped with a pure Cu first layer. The interlayer spacings are expanded due to the insertion of 8% larger Pt atoms into the second layer. The ordered mixed layer shows ripples with Pt atoms rippled outwards towards the solid-vacuum interface. The study reveals that the structure is metastable, acting as an intermediate step in the diffusion of the transition metal ion into the bulk of the Cu substrate.

对Cu覆层的Pt/Cu{100}表面合金进行表征，首先在Cu{100}上沉积0.5个单层的Pt，随后在525K下进行退火处理，从而得到尖锐的c(2×2) LEED模式。进一步使用SATLEED和ab initio平面波密度泛函计算对该结构进行分析。结果表明，表面合金由一个有序的c(2×2) CuPt第二层合金和一层纯Cu第一层组成。由于插入了8%更大的Pt原子，第二层的层间距被扩大。有序混合层显示出波动，Pt原子向外波动至固体真空界面。研究表明，该结构是不稳定的，作为过渡金属离子扩散进入Cu基体的中间步骤。

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces comprehensively. The results obtained from this process are compared with similar systems to analyze the differences and similarities in their interlayer spacings and stability. This method helps in identifying the metastable structure of the Pd/Cu system, which occurs during the diffusion of the transition metal ion into the bulk of the Cu substrate.
