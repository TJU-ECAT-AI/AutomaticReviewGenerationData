<p>Overall, the spectra resemble those obtained from the 800 K annealed surface (Fig. 3), although they have a less pronounced peak structure. Up to about 1.5 L, desorption occurs in a single peak (ρ1-peak), which is again attributed to desorption from (local) Ru areas, as the peak position coincides with the Ru(0001) α1 desorption peak.</p>
<p>Also this result agrees excellently with theoretical predictions. Ruban et al. found that the energy shift in the center of the d-band is almost identical for a pseudomorphic Pt overlayer on Ru(0001) and for a Pt impurity in the Ru(0001) surface [18]. Following the line of arguments described above, that would lead to a similar reduction in CO adsorption energy for CO adsorption on a Pt overlayer or on a Pt impurity site, in a PtRu surface alloy.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt atoms in the surface alloy has a similar effect on adsorbed CO as a pseudomorphic Pt cover layer: it significantly reduces the CO adsorption energy. Also this result agrees excellently with theoretical predictions.</p>
<p>These experiments lead to the following conclusions for CO adsorption and oxidation behavior on bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces:</p>
<p>1. The adsorption energy of CO on a Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface or on a PtRu surface alloy is significantly lower than that on either of the two pure surfaces. For 0.4 ML Pt, the onset of desorption is shifted to about 230 K on the Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface and to 250 K on the surface alloy.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The reduction in CO adsorption energy on Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surfaces and on PtRu surface alloys, compared to pure surfaces, is attributed to an electronic modification of the Pt surface atoms due to interaction with neighboring Ru atoms. This modification leads to an increased desorption rate and a reduced dynamic equilibrium coverage at operating temperatures, thus reducing the CO coverage and inhibiting H2 adsorption and dissociation. The lower barrier for CO oxidation on the bimetallic PtRu surfaces compared to the reaction on pure Pt(111) surfaces is a key factor in explaining the increased CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts. This interpretation is distinct from the bifunctional mechanism for CO oxidation on PtRu surfaces suggested earlier as an explanation for the improved CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts.

合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的方法是将Ni单层沉积在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质至关重要。在Pt单层岛覆盖的Ru(0001)表面上和PtRu表面合金上，CO吸附能的降低归因于Pt表面原子与相邻Ru原子相互作用导致的电子结构改变。这种修改导致了脱附速率的增加和在操作温度下动态平衡覆盖率的减少，从而减少了CO覆盖率并抑制了H2吸附和分解。与纯Pt(111)表面相比，bimetallic PtRu表面中CO氧化的较低活化能是解释PtRu催化剂中CO耐受性提高的关键因素。这一解释与之前提出的在PtRu表面上的CO氧化的双功能机制不同，该机制试图解释PtRu催化剂中CO耐受性改进的原因。
