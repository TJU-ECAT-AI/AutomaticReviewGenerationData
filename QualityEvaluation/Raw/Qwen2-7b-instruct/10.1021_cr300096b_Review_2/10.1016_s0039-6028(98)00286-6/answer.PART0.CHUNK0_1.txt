[1] "The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a variety of techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). These methods allow for the determination of the precise chemical composition, the morphology, and the structural arrangement of the bimetallic layers."
[2] "This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The detailed information obtained from these techniques enables researchers to predict the behavior of the bimetallic surfaces under various conditions and to optimize their properties for specific applications."
