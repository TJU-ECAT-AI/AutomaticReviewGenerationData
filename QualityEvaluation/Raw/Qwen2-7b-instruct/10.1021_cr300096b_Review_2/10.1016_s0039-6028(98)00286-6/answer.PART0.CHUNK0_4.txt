<p>The bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface was characterized by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images with chemical contrast. The defect structure and local surface composition of the bimetallic substrates were produced by epitaxial growth of monolayer Pt islands or by Pt deposition and subsequent surface alloying.</p>
<p>The TPD and TPR experiments for CO adsorption/oxidation on these surfaces showed a distinct lowering of the CO adsorption energy on the bimetallic surfaces with respect to the pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces, with the onset of CO desorption already at 230 K.</p>
<p>The reduction in adsorption energy was attributed to an electronic modification of the deposit metal due to interaction with the Ru(0001) substrate. The bimetallic surface alloy catalyzed CO oxidation under UHV conditions.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated that the change to a bimetallic surface layer led to a drastic reduction in the CO adsorption energy as compared to the pure Pt and Ru substrates. There was only a slight difference in the general shape of the CO desorption trace from a Ru(0001) surface partly covered with Pt monolayer islands and from a surface alloy containing equal amounts of Pt atoms (0.4 ML) dispersed in the topmost layer.</p>
<p>The bimetallic surface catalyzed CO2 formation under UHV conditions. The strong reduction in CO adsorption energy on the bimetallic surface was in good agreement with results obtained on heteroepitaxial monolayer films in comparable systems and also with theoretical predictions.</p>
<p>The TPR experiments on these surfaces tested for CO2 formation from COO adlayers and characterized the effect of the preadsorbed Oad on CO desorption.</p>
<p>The results showed that CO oxidation was not inhibited under UHV conditions as on pure Ru(0001) substrates, but occurred as a minority reaction, in addition to the still-dominant CO desorption. The maximum of the CO2 desorption peak was well below that for reactive CO2 desorption on Pt(111).</p>

The characterization of the Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征是通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层进行的。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。
