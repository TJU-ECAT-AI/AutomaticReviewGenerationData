[1] "The results of a comparative STM and TPD/TPR study on the adsorption and oxidation of CO on pure Ru(0001) and on structurally and compositionally well-defined, bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces are presented."
[2] "The defect structure and local surface composition of the bimetallic substrates, which are produced by epitaxial growth of monolayer Pt islands or by Pt deposition and subsequent surface alloying, are characterized by high-resolution STM images with chemical contrast."
[3] "TPD and TPR experiments for CO adsorption/oxidation on these surfaces show a distinct lowering of the CO adsorption energy on the bimetallic surfaces with respect to the pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces, with the onset of CO desorption already at 230 K."
[4] "The reduction in adsorption energy is attributed to an electronic modification of the deposit metal due to interaction with the Ru(0001) substrate."
[5] "The bimetallic surface alloy catalyzes CO oxidation under UHV conditions."
[6] "The results are discussed with respect to the superior CO tolerance of bimetallic PtRu catalysts in low-temperature fuel cell applications as compared to monometallic Pt catalysts."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations, as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The high-resolution STM images with chemical contrast provide insights into the defect structure and local surface composition of the bimetallic substrates. The TPD and TPR experiments reveal that the CO adsorption energy on bimetallic surfaces is significantly lower compared to pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces, leading to enhanced CO tolerance and activity in low-temperature fuel cell applications.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征涉及在单晶Pt（111）或聚晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层。这个过程对于结构建模和第一性原理计算至关重要，因为它使研究人员能够理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质。高分辨率的STM图像与化学对比提供了有关双金属基体缺陷结构和局部表面组成的见解。TPD和TPR实验表明，双金属表面的CO吸附能明显低于纯Ru（0001）和Pt（111）表面，这导致了低温燃料电池应用中比单金属Pt催化剂更高的CO耐受性和活性。
