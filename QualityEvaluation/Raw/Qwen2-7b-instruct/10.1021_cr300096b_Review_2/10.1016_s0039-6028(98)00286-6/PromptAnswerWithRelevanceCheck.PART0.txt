The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations, as it allows researchers to understand the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The high-resolution STM images with chemical contrast provide insights into the defect structure and local surface composition of the bimetallic substrates. The TPD and TPR experiments reveal that the CO adsorption energy on bimetallic surfaces is significantly lower compared to pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces, leading to enhanced CO tolerance and activity in low-temperature fuel cell applications.

<p>Overall, the spectra resemble those obtained from the 800 K annealed surface (Fig. 3), although they have a less pronounced peak structure. Up to about 1.5 L, desorption occurs in a single peak (ρ1-peak), which is again attributed to desorption from (local) Ru areas, as the peak position coincides with the Ru(0001) α1 desorption peak.</p>
<p>Also this result agrees excellently with theoretical predictions. Ruban et al. found that the energy shift in the center of the d-band is almost identical for a pseudomorphic Pt overlayer on Ru(0001) and for a Pt impurity in the Ru(0001) surface [18]. Following the line of arguments described above, that would lead to a similar reduction in CO adsorption energy for CO adsorption on a Pt overlayer or on a Pt impurity site, in a PtRu surface alloy.</p>
<p>The presence of Pt atoms in the surface alloy has a similar effect on adsorbed CO as a pseudomorphic Pt cover layer: it significantly reduces the CO adsorption energy. Also this result agrees excellently with theoretical predictions.</p>
<p>These experiments lead to the following conclusions for CO adsorption and oxidation behavior on bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surfaces:</p>
<p>1. The adsorption energy of CO on a Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface or on a PtRu surface alloy is significantly lower than that on either of the two pure surfaces. For 0.4 ML Pt, the onset of desorption is shifted to about 230 K on the Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surface and to 250 K on the surface alloy.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The reduction in CO adsorption energy on Pt monolayer island covered Ru(0001) surfaces and on PtRu surface alloys, compared to pure surfaces, is attributed to an electronic modification of the Pt surface atoms due to interaction with neighboring Ru atoms. This modification leads to an increased desorption rate and a reduced dynamic equilibrium coverage at operating temperatures, thus reducing the CO coverage and inhibiting H2 adsorption and dissociation. The lower barrier for CO oxidation on the bimetallic PtRu surfaces compared to the reaction on pure Pt(111) surfaces is a key factor in explaining the increased CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts. This interpretation is distinct from the bifunctional mechanism for CO oxidation on PtRu surfaces suggested earlier as an explanation for the improved CO tolerance of PtRu catalysts.

合成Ni/Pt双金属表面的方法是将Ni单层沉积在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基底上。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及全面理解这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究领域的电子和化学性质至关重要。在Pt单层岛覆盖的Ru(0001)表面上和PtRu表面合金上，CO吸附能的降低归因于Pt表面原子与相邻Ru原子相互作用导致的电子结构改变。这种修改导致了脱附速率的增加和在操作温度下动态平衡覆盖率的减少，从而减少了CO覆盖率并抑制了H2吸附和分解。与纯Pt(111)表面相比，bimetallic PtRu表面中CO氧化的较低活化能是解释PtRu催化剂中CO耐受性提高的关键因素。这一解释与之前提出的在PtRu表面上的CO氧化的双功能机制不同，该机制试图解释PtRu催化剂中CO耐受性改进的原因。

<p>The bimetallic Pt/Ru(0001) surface was characterized by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images with chemical contrast. The defect structure and local surface composition of the bimetallic substrates were produced by epitaxial growth of monolayer Pt islands or by Pt deposition and subsequent surface alloying.</p>
<p>The TPD and TPR experiments for CO adsorption/oxidation on these surfaces showed a distinct lowering of the CO adsorption energy on the bimetallic surfaces with respect to the pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces, with the onset of CO desorption already at 230 K.</p>
<p>The reduction in adsorption energy was attributed to an electronic modification of the deposit metal due to interaction with the Ru(0001) substrate. The bimetallic surface alloy catalyzed CO oxidation under UHV conditions.</p>
<p>The results demonstrated that the change to a bimetallic surface layer led to a drastic reduction in the CO adsorption energy as compared to the pure Pt and Ru substrates. There was only a slight difference in the general shape of the CO desorption trace from a Ru(0001) surface partly covered with Pt monolayer islands and from a surface alloy containing equal amounts of Pt atoms (0.4 ML) dispersed in the topmost layer.</p>
<p>The bimetallic surface catalyzed CO2 formation under UHV conditions. The strong reduction in CO adsorption energy on the bimetallic surface was in good agreement with results obtained on heteroepitaxial monolayer films in comparable systems and also with theoretical predictions.</p>
<p>The TPR experiments on these surfaces tested for CO2 formation from COO adlayers and characterized the effect of the preadsorbed Oad on CO desorption.</p>
<p>The results showed that CO oxidation was not inhibited under UHV conditions as on pure Ru(0001) substrates, but occurred as a minority reaction, in addition to the still-dominant CO desorption. The maximum of the CO2 desorption peak was well below that for reactive CO2 desorption on Pt(111).</p>
