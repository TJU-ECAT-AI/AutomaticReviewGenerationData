Abstract 
The properties of ultrathin Cu films on Pt(100)hex and their thermally activated transformation into Cu-Pt surface alloys 
are investigated by AES, LEED and PAX. Cu deposition at room temperature leads to a local lifting of the hexagonal Pt 
surface reconstruction which is completed by one pseudomorphic Cu monolayer. Below 550 K the Cu then continues to 
grow with its own Cu(100) lattice parameter. With increasing temperature different metastable ordered Cu-Pt surface alloys 
could be prepared due to the interdiffusion of the components. Between 550 and 650 K a c(2 X 2) superstructure is observed, 
while between 650 and 750 K a phase transition to a p(2 x 2) or a (2 X 1) is detected. PAX measurements reveal 
unambiguously a pure Cu termination of both surface alloy phases. Above 950 K the Cu disappears into the bulk leaving a 
clean Pt(100)hex surface behind.

1. Introduction 
The formation of heteroepitaxial films and surface 
alloys is a promising way of producing surfaces with 
new physical and chemical properties. In this paper 
we present some results about the properties of 
ultrathin Cu films on Pt(100)hex as well as their 
thermally activated transformation into Cu-Pt sur- 
face alloys which are investigated using AES (Auger 
electron spectroscopy) LEED (low energy electron 
diffraction) and PAX (photoemission of adsorbed 
Xenon) [ 1].

The Pt(100) surface is one of the most frequently 
studied examples of a reconstructing metal surface. 
Two reconstructed phases - 
the hexagonal one 
(Pt(100)hex) below 1100 K and a hexagonal-rotated 
one (Pt(100)hex-ro0 - are found [2]. This recon- 
struction can be lifted by adsorption of one of the 
gases H2, NO and CO in order to obtain a metastable 
Pt(100)l × 1 surface. The perfectness of the resultant 
1 X 1 surface phase depends on the adsorbate used 
for lifting the reconstruction [3-5]. 
Here we show that a Cu film grows in a (100)1 X 1 
structnre on a Pt(100)hex substrate. This result is in 
agreement with the experimental finding by Sachtler 
et al. [6] for Au/Pt(100) and by Stri~ber et al. for 
Ag/Pt(100) [7]. These authors explain the lifting of 
the reconstruction in terms of lattice-mateh argu-

ments between the Pt surface layer and the deposited 
film. 
For coverages above 2 ML and below 550 K Cu 
grows with its own Cu(100) lattice parameter. At the 
temperature of 550 K the Cu diffusion into the Pt 
bulk begins and the formation of a c(2 × 2) super- 
structure is observed in LEED investigations. Be- 
tween 650 and 750 K a phase transition is observed. 
As yet, however, it is not possible to distinguish 
clearly between a (2 X 1) and a p(2 x 2) superstruc- 
ture, as will be discussed later. A very interesting 
result is, that PAX measurements reveal a pure Cu 
termination of both alloy surfaces. This shows, that 
the energy of the pure Cu(100) surface is lower than 
that one of the mixed alloy surface. Above 950 K Cu 
disappears into the bulk leaving a clean Pt(100)hex 
surface behind. 
pressure was always below 5 X 10 -8 Pa during 
evaporation. The Cu flux was controlled by stabilis- 
ing the source temperature measured by a Pt/PtRh 
thermocouple. For coverage calibration combined 
PAX and AES data were used; a layer-by-layer 
growth was found. 
The sample could be heated to 1300 K by electron 
bombardment and cooled down to 45 K using a 
closed loop He refrigerator. A Ni/NiCr thermocou- 
pie was spot-welded to the backside of the Pt crystal. 
The sample was cleaned by repetitive argon ion 
sputtering and annealing in 10-5-10 -4 Pa oxygen at 
900 K. No carbon or other impurities could be 
detected with AES after this procedure. The LEED 
picture was identical to that of a Pt(100)hex surface 
[2]; LEED intensities could be monitored with a 
CCD camera. 
2. Experimental setup 
The experiments were carried out in a UHV 
system (base pressure 1 X 10 -8 Pa) equipped with 
AES, LEED and ARUPS. Cu was evaporated from a 
tungsten basket heated by electron bombardment. 
Contamination of the samples during the deposition 
process was prevented by an integrated liquid nitro- 
gen cooling shield around the Cu source, so that the

3.1. Cu films on Pt(lOO)hex below 550 K 
Cu was evaporated at 300 K onto the Pt(100)hex 
surface. After the deposition the sample was an- 
nealed to 500 K in order to heal out defects. Up to 
this temperature no hints for segregation of Pt into 
the Cu film was found. Fig. 1 shows a set of LEED

pattern, in which the different stages of film growth 
depending on Cu coverage are presented. First, the 
clean Pt(100)hex surface with the well-known (5 x 
25) superstructure is shown. Here, only one domain 
is visible, the second one is very weak. With increas- 
ing Cu coverage the intensity of the extra spots due 
to the reconstruction decreases (Fig. lb). At 1 ML 
Cu coverage, only the main spots of the square lxl 
lattice are detected; the reconstruction is lifted (Fig. 
lc). The Cu monolayer is pseudomorphic to a 
Pt(100)l X 1 surface. Additional deposition of Cu on 
the sample leads to double spots in the LEED (Fig, 
ld). The additional spots correspond to a lattice 
constant, which is 8% smaller than that of the 
Pt(100)l X 1 substrate. This lattice constant is typi- 
cal for Cu, and shows that (beyond the second 
monolayer) Cu continues to grow with its own lattice 
constant. 
An important question concerns the structure of 
the Cu-free Pt areas for submonolayer Cu coverages. 
In order to solve this problem we took advantage of 
the possibility to lift the Pt reconstruction by adsorb- 
ing hydrogen at 100 K and short annealing to 300 K. 
ff the reconstruction is lifted on the Cu-free Pt 
patches already by the Cu deposition prior to hydro- 
gen adsorption, the admitted hydrogen will be ad- 
sorbed on Pt(100)l X 1 substrate areas. Additional 
annealing leads to the desorption of part of this 
hydrogen and in a characterization with PAX a 
Xe-induced 5Pl/2 photoemission peak between 6.0 
and 6.1 eV (below Fermi energy) is typical for this 
system [9]. By contrast, Xe adsorbed on a bare 
Pt(100) surface, the reconstruction of which is lifted 
by hydrogen adsorption at 100 K and annealing to 
300 K, causes a 5Pl/2 peak between 5,8 and 5.9 eV 
[10]. Therefore, with PAX it is possible to distin- 
guish, whether the reconstruction of the bare Pt 
patches is also lifted submonolayer amounts of Cu 
(prior to H 2 adsorption) or by the post-adsorption of 
hydrogen. In Fig. 2 we present the result of a PAX 
investigation of a Pt(100) surface covered with 0.5 
ML. Peak I and peak III, between 7 and 7.5 eV can 
be assigned to Xe on the Cu islands on the sample. 
Peak II can be correlated with the superposition of 
the 5Pl/2 state of Xe on the Pt patches and the 5p3/2 
state of Xe on the Cu islands. Both states are at 6.1 
eV and it is not possible to resolve them. After 
adsorbing hydrogen on the surface at 100 K and

annealing to 300 K in the PAX spectra a new peak 
IV appears at 5.9 eV which indicates the lifting of 
the reconstruction of the Cu-free Pt patches by the 
hydrogen. Simultaneously, the peak II at 6.1 eV lost 
intensity. This experiment shows clearly, that the 
Cu-free Pt areas are reconstructed before hydrogen 
adsorption. Cu deposition leads only to a local lift- 
ing of the hexagonal Pt surface reconstruction; at the 
Cu-free patches the reconstruction persists. 
In the literature a geometrical argument for the 
lifting of the reconstruction is given by Sachtler et al. 
in the case of Au/Pt(100) [6]. The greater Au atoms 
stabilize the less dense Pt(100)l X 1 substrate and 
destabilize the denser Pt(100)hex phase. This argu- 
ment can be excluded for the system Cu/Pt(100), 
because the Cu atoms are smaller than the Pt atoms. 
In agreement with earlier publications [8] Scheffler 
et al. suggest an electronic explanation for the recon-

struction of the Pt(100) surface [11]. Therefore, the 
dramatic electronic change at the surface observed 
after the deposition of the Cu on the Pt(100)hex 
substrate - the surface state at 0.6 eV, which is 
typical for Pt(100)hex, is absent after Cu evaporation 
- is likely be the reason for the lifting of the 
reconstruction in the present case. 
3.2. Chemical analysis of the films annealed higher

A 5 ML thick Cu film was annealed for five 
minutes at temperatures between 500 and 1000 K. 
Subsequently, the ratio rr,t

near-surface region was calculated from the peak- 
to-peak intensities of the Cu-105 eV and Pt-237 eV 
Auger signals in differentiated AES data. As clearly

see in Fig. 3 an increase of the temperature leads to 
an increase of the amount of Pt in the detection 
volume of AES. This shows, that for temperatures 
higher than 550 K Cu migrates into the Pt bulk. At 
1000 K, nearly all Cu is dissolved in the Pt bulk. 
These results are in accordance with the measure- 
ments of Yeates et al., who also found a diffusion of 
Cu into the Pt bulk for temperature higher than 500 
K for Cu/Pt(111) [12]. The results, however, differ 
for the resultant topmost layer. For the (111) surface 
Yeates et al. found Pt in the topmost layer for all 
annealing temperatures above 500 K as demonstrated 
by CO-TDS experiments. By contrast, on the (100) 
surface we found no Pt in the topmost layer up to 
temperatures of 900 K using PAX intensities as a 
titration for the various surface sites. Only above 900 
K Pt atoms diffuse to the topmost layer and at 1000 
K a nearly pure Pt surface is observed (Fig. 3, inset). 
These results of chemical analysis show that Pt 
atoms migrate into the Cu overlayer at temperatures 
higher than 550 K, but the produced alloy films 
remain Cu-terminated up to 900 K. 
3.3. Cu/Pt(lO0) at 650 K 
A structural analysis of the 5 ML Cu film an- 
nealed at 650 K was made by LEED. In the square 
lattice of the known (1 × 1) LEED pattern a central 
spot appears which is a clear sign for a c(2 X 2) 
symmetry (Fig. 4). This can be explained by the 
formation of a L12 structure known for a Cu3Pt

alloy [13]. Cut parallel to the (100) plane this Cu3Pt 
alloy has a bilayer arrangement with alternating pure 
Cu and mixed PtCu layers. Due to the lower surface 
energy of a pure Cu(100) plane the alloy will be 
Cu-terminated as, indeed, observed in the PAX ex- 
periments. With our methods it is not possible to 
make any statement about the composition of the 
third and deeper layers, but for the two topmost 
layers the Cu3Pt structure is in agreement with all 
experimental data. 
3.4. Cu / Pt(lO0) at 750K 
By further annealing up to 750 K half-order spots 
appear in the LEED pattern while at the same tem- 
peratures the central spot of the c(2 × 2) structure 
loses intensity. This new structure arises either from 
a (2 × 1) pattern in two domains or a p(2 × 2) 
structure. At present, it is not possible to distinguish 
clearly between these two structures because the 
observed very low intensity of the central spot - 
differentiating between the (2)< 1) and p(2×2) 
structures - could also be caused by small remaining 
areas of the c(2 × 2) alloy. Another possibility to 
explain this behaviour of the central spot is a mixture 
of both new possible structures on the surface: the 
(2 X 1) and the p(2 × 2). Further experiments are 
necessary to explain this complex behaviour of the 
surface alloy prepared at 750 K. 
The possible interpretations of the new LEED 
pattern lead to two structural proposals for the new 
surface alloy (Fig. 5). The first is derived from the 
structure of the well-known CuPt alloy [13], in which 
all planes contain Cu and Pt atoms. This together 
with the fact, that the first monolayer is a pure Cu 
plane (see above) leads to the conclusion that this 
structure has a (2 X 1) symmetry. 
The second proposal deduced from the p(2 X 2) 
pattern is a CusPt 3 alloy with an L13 structure the 
existence of which as a bulk alloy, however, is 
controversially discussed in the literature [14]. Here 
the pure Cu and the mixed CuPt planes alternate like 
in the Cu3Pt structure. The first monolayer is again 
pure Cu. For both possible structures of the alloy 
produced at 750 K calculation of the normalized Pt 
intensity from all layers measured by AES using the 
Lambert-Beer law gives nearly the same value, 
which shows, that AES alone cannot distinguish

4. Summary 
Cu deposition on a Pt(100)hex surface leads to a 
local lifting of the hexagonal reconstruction, which 
is completed by 1 ML Cu. Below 550 K the Cu film 
then continuous to grow with its own lattice parame- 
ter. With annealing to 650 K an ordered Cu3Pt 
surface alloy with a c(2 X 2) symmetry and a pure 
Cu termination could be prepared. Between 650 and 
750 K a phase transition occurs within the surface 
alloy, but it is not yet possible to distinguish clearly 
between a CuPt alloy phase with (2 x 1) structure or 
a CusPt 3 phase which leads to a p(2 X 2) LEED 
pattern. For all these metastable alloy phases a pure 
Cu termination was found. Above 950 K Cu diffuses 
into the Pt bulk and above 1000 K the pure 
Pt(100)hex structure is restored.
