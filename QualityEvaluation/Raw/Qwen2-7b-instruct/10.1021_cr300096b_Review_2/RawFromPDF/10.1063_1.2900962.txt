The stability of subsurface

metals to remain in the subsurface layer. DFT calculations predicted that for both (111) and (100) crystal planes the subsurface

I. INTRODUCTION
Previous studies have shown promising results that alloying Pt with a
3
d
group transition metal (Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, Cr, V, and Ti) often results in novel physical and chemical properties.1,2 Some of these bimetallic systems have been shown to increase the activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) as cathode elecrocatalysts in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells as compared to pure Pt. Specifically, it has been shown experimentally that Pt–Ni,3–12 Pt–Co,3,5,6,9,10,12 and Pt–Fe3,4,13 bimetallic electrocatalysts increase the activity by as much as 90 times that of the current
Pt
∕
C
industrial catalysts.8 This increase in activity is attributed to the modification of electronic properties when substituting a
3
d
group transition metal into the subsurface of a Pt catalyst.14,15 However, depending on the reaction environment, this desired bimetallic surface configuration may not be stable and may interchange into a lower active surface configuration.
There are three types of
Pt
–
3
d
bimetallic surface configurations: the surface structure with
3
d
metals on top, a mixed surface configuration of Pt and
3
d
atoms, and a subsurface structure with
3
d
metals residing underneath the surface Pt atoms.15–17 The surface configuration consists of a pseudomorphic monolayer of
3
d
atoms on the Pt substrate, which is the structure when evaporating
3
d
metals onto Pt at low temperatures in vacuum.16 The mixed surface is where both
3
d
and Pt atoms are present in the outermost layer. The subsurface configuration, in the ideal case, has the outermost layer comprised of Pt and the second layer of
3
d
atoms.
For
3
d
transitions metals which are evaporated onto a Pt substrate or for surfaces prepared from
Pt
–
3
d
bulk alloys, the surface of the annealed sample often leads to a unique subsurface configuration in which the surface forms a “Pt-skin” layer for the outermost layer. The second layer is enriched in the
3
d
transition metal. It is this subsurface configuration [hereafter denoted as
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
(
h
k
l
)
] that has been shown to increase the ORR activity.6–8,10 Previously, the ORR activity has been correlated with the oxygen binding energy18,19 and the increased activity for the subsurface configuration has partially been attributed to the weaker oxygen binding energy as compared to Pt(111), thereby preventing the catalyst surface from being poisoned by strongly adsorbed oxygen.15,18–20 However, the oxygen binding energy on the surface configuration [hereafter denoted as
3
d
–
Pt
–
Pt
(
111
)
] has been predicted to bind oxygen much more strongly than pure Pt(111).21 This would predict that if the subsurface
3
d
transition metal segregates to the surface, this would decrease the electrocatalytic activity to be lower than that of Pt. Therefore, it is proposed that the stability of the subsurface configuration is important in maintaining the lifetime and activity of the
Pt
–
3
d
bimetallic electrocatalysts.
Previously, our research group has studied the stability of the
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
(
111
)
subsurface configuration when exposed to oxygen.21 It was predicted by density functional theory (DFT) and verified experimentally that the
3
d
transition metal in the subsurface is thermodynamically unstable in the presence of adsorbed oxygen atoms. DFT predicted that Pt–Ni–Pt(111) was the most stable, having the smallest potential for surface segregation, and Pt–Ti–Pt(111) was the most unstable with the largest potential for segregation in oxygen. Experimentally, it was found that Pt–Ni–Pt(111) was more stable than Pt–Co–Pt(111), with activation barrier for segregation of
3
d
metals being
15
±
2
and
7
±

kcal
∕
mol
⁠, respectively. This previous research would suggest that the (111) regions of
Pt
–
3
d
electrocatalyst nanoparticles are susceptible to catalyst degradation and may play a role in determining the lifetime of active electrocatalysts.
However, since the electrocatalyst nanoparticles used in PEM fuel cells are comprised of both the (111) and (100) crystal planes as well as step edges, the current study will expand the current understanding to include a comparison of the predicted ORR activity and stability between the (111) and (100) crystal planes using DFT. Using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), the activation barrier for surface segregation of Ni and Co from a polycrystalline Pt foil, which is composed of mainly the (111) and (100) faces, will be determined when exposed to oxygen. These observations will then be discussed in relation to their use as cathode electrocatalysts in PEM fuel cells.
II. METHODS
A. Density functional theory method
The ab initio calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) version 4.6.22–24 The core electrons were represented using the ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials (US-PP).25,26 The PW91 functional27 was used for the exchange-correlation energy approximation utilized within the generalized gradient approximation.28 The basis set consisted of plane waves with an energy cutoff of
396
eV
⁠. The Pt(111) and Pt(100) surfaces were modeled using a periodic
2
×

unit cell slab with four layers of metal and six equivalent layers of vacuum separating each slab. The surface

configurations were modeled by substituting the entire first layer with a

group transition metal from Ni to Ti with the remaining three layers composed of Pt. The subsurface

and

configurations were composed of Pt in the first, third, and fourth layers while the second layer was completely substituted with a
3

metal. The top two layers were allowed to relax to the lowest energy configuration, while the third and fourth layers were frozen at the bulk Pt–Pt distance of
2.83
Å
⁠, as previously determined for the PW91 exchange-correlation functional.29 A

Monkhorst–Pack
k
-point mesh30 was used, resulting in five irreducible
k
-points in the first Brillouin zone. To simulate 0.5 ML O adatoms, two of the four threefold hollow sites for the (111) plane were occupied by O atoms. For Pt(100), both the fourfold hollow sites and the twofold bridge sites were studied by filling two of the eight twofold bridge sites or by filling two of the four fourfold hollow sites with O atoms. The
d
-band center of mass was calculated by projecting the plane waves onto spherical harmonic orbitals using the DACAPO V2.7 code.31 The
d
-band center of mass in the current study is defined as the first moment of the
d
-orbital states for the four surface atoms using a Gaussian smearing method between
k
-points and an infinite cutoff radius.
B. Techniques
The AES measurements were performed in a two-level stainless steel ultrahigh-vacuum chamber with a base pressure of
1
×
10
−
10
Torr
⁠, equipped with a Phi 10-155 single-pass cylindrical mirror analyzer for AES and a UTI 100C quadrupole mass spectrometer for temperature-programed desorption experiments. The sample temperature was heated at a rate of
3
K
∕
s
for all quoted annealing temperatures.
C. Sample preparation
The Pt foil sample was a
15
×
12
mm
2
rectangular piece cut from a larger polycrystalline Pt foil (99.997%) with a thickness of
0.1
mm
⁠. The foil was attached to two tantalum posts by bending
1
mm
of the two longer opposite edges of the foil around two separate tantalum posts and spot welding the foil to the posts using the back side of these flaps. The Ta posts were used as electrical and thermal contacts for resistive heating and liquid nitrogen cooling. This mounting scheme allowed the temperature of the Pt foil to be varied between 90 and
1200
K
⁠. The temperature was monitored by spot welding a
K
-type thermocouple to the back of the foil. The Pt surface was cleaned by sputtering
Ne

while holding the foil at
500
K
followed by backdosing
O

at
5
×
10
−

Torr
with the foil at
600
K
and by annealing in vacuum to
1050
K
⁠. This cleaning cycle was repeated until the surface contaminants, such as C and O, were below the detection limit of AES.
The bimetallic surfaces were prepared by evaporating Ni or Co by line of sight onto the Pt foil using a high-purity Ni (99.994%) or Co (99.999%) wire wrapped around a tungsten filament. The deposition was performed while the Pt foil was at a temperature of
350
K
⁠. The coverage of the Ni or Co overlayer was estimated by monitoring the

A. Oxygen dissociative binding energy
The trends of the binding energy for oxygen as well as the predicted thermodynamic potential for surface segregation were calculated for the Pt(111) and Pt(100) crystal slabs for
Pt

bimetallic surfaces in vacuum and with 0.5 ML atomic oxygen. The binding energy of oxygen has been previously correlated with the electrocatalytic activity for the ORR.18,19 Therefore, using this same correlation to predict the relative trend in activity for ORR, the calculated dissociative binding energies for oxygen on
Pt

on Pt(111) and Pt(100) are shown in Fig. 1. The dissociative binding energy of 0.5 ML of adsorbate

The binding energies for the Pt(111) systems are the solid triangles while the Pt(100) systems are represented by the open, hatched circles for the twofold bridge site and the open diamonds are for the fourfold hollow site. The labels at the top of the figure are for the Pt(111) systems. Comparing the two binding sites for Pt(100), the twofold bridge site is thermodynamically preferred for atomic adsorption of oxygen except for Mn–Pt–Pt(100), Cr–Pt–Pt(100), and Ti–Pt–Pt(100). For the remainder of this paper, the thermodynamically preferred site will be used for each Pt(100) system.

As shown in Fig. 1, similar trends are observed for both the (111) and (100) substrates. The subsurface
Pt

3
d

–
Pt
structures bind oxygen much more strongly than pure Pt. It is important to note that while these are model bimetallic systems, this is similar to the trends predicted for systems based on bulk alloy bimetallic systems15 and small cluster models which most resemble the structure of the subsurface and surface configurations.33 Using Sabatier’s principle34 for the optimum catalyst, these binding energies would predict that the surface
3
d
–
Pt
–
Pt
structures for both crystal planes would have much lower ORR activity than pure Pt due to the strong binding energies of oxygen. On the other hand, due to the weaker binding energies, some of the subsurface
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
systems would be predicted to potentially show increased activity versus Pt. More detailed discussion of predicted ORR activity will be presented later. Figure 1 also shows that, when comparing the
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
surfaces, the binding energies for all of the (100) systems are stronger than the corresponding (111) counterparts. Alternatively, comparing the
3
d
–
Pt
–
Pt
surfaces the binding energies for nearly all of the (100) systems are weaker than the (111) systems except Cr–Pt–Pt(100).
For the oxygen binding energies in Fig. 1 and subsequent predicted parameters, the reported values are calculated using a
3

In order to compare the different properties of mixed alloy surfaces as compared to the surface and subsurface structures, Fig. 3 shows the oxygen binding energy on various

surfaces. The amount of Ni was held constant at 1 ML but the amount of Ni in the surface and subsurface was varied linearly from surface Ni–Pt–Pt(111) to subsurface Pt–Ni–Pt(111). The intermixed configurations are labeled as

indicates the percentage of surface Ni atoms, with the remaining Ni atoms residing in the second layer. As shown in Fig. 3, the binding energy and the surface
d
-band center are roughly the weighted sum between the two extremes of the surface and subsurface Pt–Ni bimetallic configurations. The results also reveal that the binding energies on the intermixed surfaces are generally between the Pt(111) and Ni(111) parent metal surfaces. This is qualitatively different from the surface and subsurface configurations, where the binding energies are either stronger or weaker than both of the parent metal surfaces.

Pt
(

and
3
d
–
Pt
–
Pt
(

3
d
metals to remain in the subsurface region will be important for applications such as ORR catalysts. The thermodynamic potential for surface segregation is calculated for all of these systems with 0.5 ML O. The thermodynamic potential for surface segregation is defined in this paper as

metal pairs per unit cell, which in this case is 4 for a

unit cell. Under vacuum conditions without adsorbates,
Δ

is just the difference between the clean surface and subsurface slab energies. Based on this definition, a positive value of
Δ

means that the subsurface configuration is thermodynamically preferred whereas a negative value indicates that the surface configuration is preferred.
The predicted thermodynamic stability of the (111) and (100) systems is presented in Fig. 4. The calculated energy is the energy that would be consumed or released for switching one

metal pair either in vacuum or with adsorbed O. For both the (111) and (100) systems, the same general trend is observed, where the subsurface configuration is predicted to be thermodynamically stable in a vacuum environment but the surface configuration is predicted to be thermodynamically preferred with 0.5 ML of atomic oxygen. Furthermore, for both crystal planes, the potential to produce the
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
subsurface configuration is the smallest for Pt–Ni–Pt and the largest for Pt–Ti–Pt. Similarly for 0.5 ML O, Pt–Ni is predicted to have the smallest potential for the segregation of the
3
d
metal atoms to the surface while Pt–Ti is predicted to have the largest potential for segregation.

When comparing the
Pt
–
3
d
systems between crystal planes, the (100) systems are predicted to have a larger potential for subsurface formation in vacuum in comparison to the respective (111) systems except for Pt–Ni and Pt–Co. For stability with adsorbed oxygen, all of the (100) systems are predicted to have a smaller potential for segregation of the
3
d
metal to the surface in comparison to the corresponding (111) bimetallic surfaces. Therefore, the
Pt

structures are predicted to be more stable than the corresponding

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A. Preparation of Pt–Ni–Pt and Pt–Co–Pt subsurface structures on Pt foil
In order to verify the trends from DFT calculations, the stability of Pt–Ni–Pt and Pt–Co–Pt was examined experimentally on polycrystalline Pt foil. The surface compositions were determined by using the
Ni
(
849
eV
)
∕
Pt
(
241
eV
)
or
Co
(
777
eV
)
∕
Pt
(
241
eV
)
AES ratio. As previously determined by our research group for a Pt(111) single crystal surface, a
Ni
∕
Pt
AES ratio of
∼
1.0
after annealing to
600
K
corresponds to 1 ML of Ni in the Pt–Ni–Pt structures.16 Similarly, a
Co
∕
Pt
AES ratio of
∼
2.0
after annealing to
600
K
corresponds to a 1 ML of Co in the subsurface structure.32 
The thermally induced diffusion of the Ni or Co atoms from the surface into the bulk is compared in Fig. 5, which shows the
Ni
∕
Pt
or
Co
∕
Pt
AES ratio versus the annealing temperature. The AES spectra were collected on bimetallic surfaces that were produced by evaporating Ni or Co onto the polycrystalline Pt foil by line of sight at
350
K
⁠. The samples were then heated to higher temperatures and held at the given temperature for
30
s
⁠. The samples were then cooled down to
400
K
and AES scans were measured at
400
K
between each annealing increment. Both Pt–Ni and Pt–Co systems show that up to about
500
K
⁠, the
Ni
∕
Pt
or
Co
∕
Pt
AES ratio remains relatively constant. Above
500
K
⁠, the decrease of both the
Ni
∕
Pt
and
Co
∕
Pt
AES ratios is separated into two regions. Between 500 and
800
K
⁠, the AES ratio of
Ni
∕
Pt
decreases relatively slowly to the first discontinuity; after
800
K
⁠, the AES ratio decreases more rapidly to 0 as the temperature is increased to
1050
K
⁠. The
Co
∕
Pt
system also shows two regions but exhibits a faster diffusion rate above
500
K
in comparison to Ni. The first decrease in the AES ratio between 500 and
800
K
for Ni or between 500 and
650
K
for Co is attributed to the diffusion of Ni or Co into the near surface region, as observed previously in Pt(111).16 This was verified by the ability to completely recover the original
Ni
∕
Pt
or
Co
∕
Pt
AES ratio by exposing the sample to oxygen at elevated temperatures (not shown). The second quicker decrease above this first temperature region is attributed to the diffusion of Ni or Co atoms into the bulk past the second layer. Beyond this region, the original
Ni
∕
Pt
or
Co
∕
Pt
AES ratio was unrecoverable by using oxygen to induce the segregation of Ni or Co to the surface (not shown).

B. Stability of Pt–Ni–Pt and Pt–Co–Pt exposed to oxygen

and annealed to
700
K
⁠. The AES ratio was normalized using the AES ratios after deposition and after annealing to
700
K
⁠. In this procedure, a normalized AES ratio of 0 corresponds to the postannealed sample structure where the Ni atoms have diffused into the sublayer and 1 corresponds to all Ni atoms present on the surface. While the exact surface composition of the
700
K
annealed sample was not observed directly, the normalization of 0 will capture only the Ni atoms that have diffused inward. Therefore, even if some residual Ni atoms remain on the surface, their contribution to the AES ratio is removed from this analysis procedure.
The effect of exposing Pt–Ni–Pt on Pt foil to oxygen at various temperatures is shown in Fig. 6(a). The experiments were conducted by heating the Pt–Ni–Pt surface to a given temperature and backfilling the chamber with oxygen in the range of
10
−
8
–
10
−
7
Torr
⁠. The sample was cooled to
400
K
between exposures to perform AES measurements. In the exposure temperatures between 500 and
660
K
⁠, the
Ni
∕
Pt
AES ratio increases with exposure to oxygen. At
660
K
⁠, all the Ni atoms that initially diffused into the foil were recovered by an exposure of
512
L
of oxygen, suggesting that the Ni atoms that diffused into the foil remained in the near surface region. While all of the exposure temperatures show that the
Ni
∕
Pt
AES ratio increases with oxygen exposure, the lower temperature regime of
500
–
590
K
shows that the
Ni
∕
Pt
AES ratio saturates at a value of approximately 0.6 within the exposure window observed. In the higher temperature regime,
600
–
660
K
⁠, the
Ni
∕
Pt
AES ratio increases past 0.6 and saturates to 1.0, corresponding to all of the Ni atoms segregating to the surface.

Due to the presence of two temperature regimes, it is proposed that the segregation of Ni can be modeled using two parallel reactions corresponding to Ni segregation from either the (111) or the (100) crystal planes as follows:

.
The two observable regions within Fig. 6(a) is then due to the separation of time scales of the reaction rate constants for the (111) and (100) regions,
k
1
and
k
2
⁠. Assuming that the pre-exponential factors are similar, if the activation barriers of the two reactions are significantly different, i.e.,
k
1
⪢
k
2
⁠, the two reactions will be separated by reaction rate time scales. At low temperatures, the first reaction would be the only observable reaction in a given short time frame and eventually would saturate after reaching
B
0
⁠, the total amount Ni from the (111) region initially in the subsurface. The second reaction rate would be comparably slow and would have a negligible contribution to the AES ratio within this short time frame. As the temperature is increased where the rate of the second reaction is significant, the first reaction would saturate quickly and the only observable reaction would occur between an AES ratio of
B
0
and 1.0.
Using this proposed reaction scheme, the activation barrier was estimated using an Arrhenius equation and observing the amount of oxygen exposure required to reach a given normalized AES ratio value. The general equation for the linearization of the reaction rate can be expressed as

(

)
⁠. For the low temperature regime, the activation barrier was calculated by averaging the activation barriers found by measuring the exposure needed to reach a normalized AES ratios of 0.4, 0.43, and 0.46 for the temperature curves between 500 and
590
K
⁠. For the high temperature regime, the activation barrier was calculated by averaging the activation barriers found by measuring the exposure needed to reach normalized AES ratios of 0.81, 0.85, and 0.89 for the temperature curves between 600 and
660
K
⁠. The Arrhenius curves are plotted in Fig. 6(b) and the corresponding

is similar to that previously determined by our research group for Ni on a Pt(111) single crystal of

⁠.21 Therefore, this activation barrier is assumed to account for the diffusion of subsurface Ni from the (111) regions of the Pt foil. The larger activation barrier of

is then assigned to the (100) regions of the Pt foil based on the DFT predicted trend of the thermodynamic stability in Fig. 4, where Pt–Ni–Pt(100) is predicted to have a smaller potential for segregation in oxygen and therefore should have a larger activation barrier as compared to (111).

2. Pt–Co–Pt on Pt foil
Similar AES measurements were performed for the Pt–Co–Pt structure on Pt foil. However, when the sample was annealed to
700
K
⁠, only approximately 45% of the initial Co that diffused into the bulk was recoverable by an exposure temperature of
660
K
(not shown). Therefore, the Pt–Co samples were only annealed to
625
K
after the initial deposition at
350
K
⁠. The same normalization procedure was used for the Pt–Co system except now the AES ratio after annealing to
625
K
was used for each sample. Figure 7(a) shows the normalized
Co
∕
Pt
AES ratio as a function of oxygen exposure for various exposure temperatures. All of the Co that initially diffused into the foil was recoverable by an exposure temperature of
590
K
and
512
L
of oxygen. Unlike the Pt–Ni system that displayed two temperature regimes, the Pt–Co system only displayed one regime for the surface segregation of Co. Therefore, the activation barrier was calculated assuming only one reaction. This analysis is shown in Fig. 7(b) and the activation barrier for Co to segregate from the sublayer to the surface was found to be
10
±
1
kcal
∕
mol
in the temperature regime of
500
–
590
K
⁠. This activation barrier is similar to the value previously determined by our research group for Co on a Pt(111) single crystal of
7
±
1
kcal
∕
mol
⁠.21 Therefore, this activation barrier is assigned to segregation of subsurface Co from the (111) regions of the Pt foil.

V. DISCUSSION
A. Predicted effect of crystal plane on ORR activity
Previous studies have correlated the oxygen binding energy with the ORR activity.18,19 While pure Pt has been shown to have the highest activity for the ORR of a single metal catalyst, some bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt–Ni, Pt–Co, and Pt–Fe, have shown increased activity over pure Pt(111). This increased activity has partially been attributed to the weaker binding energy of O and OH on these Pt-skin bimetallic surfaces. The weaker binding energy prevents the surface from being poisoned by the adsorption of the reaction intermediates, such as atomic oxygen. However, while some of the subsurface configurations have been shown experimentally with increased ORR activity, at some point the binding energy will become too weak and the reaction will not proceed.
In a recent study by Stamenkovic et al.,8 the Pt(100) surface was found to have a lower ORR activity than Pt(111), which could potentially be due to Pt(100) binding oxygen too strongly as predicted in Fig. 1. The Pt–Ni–Pt(100) surface was found to have activity that was similar to Pt(111). The Pt–Ni–Pt(111) surface was found to have the highest activity for the different crystal planes for the Pt–Ni–Pt system. These results are similar to what is predicted by the oxygen binding energies by DFT for these surfaces in Fig. 1 where Pt–Ni–Pt(100) is predicted to bind oxygen similar to Pt(111) and Pt–Ni–Pt(111) has a significantly reduced binding energy.
In a similar study, Stamenkovic et al.19 studied the ORR activity for Ni, Co, Fe, V, and Ti in polycrystalline Pt. In this study, they experimentally found a volcanolike activity with Pt–Co having the highest activity. The significant increase in activity found for Pt–Ni, Pt–Co, and Pt–Fe over Pt is potentially due to the near optimal binding energy of oxygen for both the (111) and (100) crystal grain areas of the polycrystalline Pt. The decrease in the activity as the
3
d
metal is switched to the earlier V and Ti metals is possibly due to the binding energy for the (111) areas being too weak even though the (100) areas are predicted to have optimal binding energy near that found for Pt–Ni–Pt(111). The loss of the activity in the (111) areas could lead to potentially 50% of the surface being inactive. Using the comparison with these two experimental studies, the optimal binding energy seems to include increased activity for the Pt–Ni–Pt(111), Pt–Co–Pt(111), and Pt–Fe–Pt(111) surfaces as well as nearly all of the
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
(
100
)
surfaces.
The importance of the stability of the outer Pt-skin layer for the subsurface
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
catalyst is also illustrated in Fig. 1 by comparing the binding energies of oxygen on the subsurface and surface systems for a given
Pt
–
3
d
system. All of the surface configurations, for both
3
d
–
Pt
–
Pt
(
111
)
and
3
d
–
Pt
–
Pt
(
100
)
⁠, are predicted to bind oxygen much more strongly (⁠
47
–
232
kcal
∕
mol
stronger) than Pt(111). Therefore, these surface configurations are predicted to have much lower activity than pure Pt(111) since the surfaces would be poisoned by binding oxygen too strongly and inhibiting the subsequent ORR reaction pathways. While
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
(
111
)
and
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
(
100
)
systems may have increased activity, if the
3
d
transition metal segregates to the surface, this would potentially decrease the activity to below that of pure Pt(111).
B. Effect of crystal plane on subsurface stability
Based on the predicted activity difference between the subsurface and surface configurations, the stability of the
3
d
transition metal in the subsurface will be important in increasing the lifetime of the bimetallic catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4, while the subsurface configuration is predicted to be thermodynamically stable in vacuum, the surface configuration is predicted to be thermodynamically preferred when exposed to 0.5 ML O. The reason for the instability is related to the relative difference of the oxygen binding energy between the surface and subsurface systems. Substituting the definition for the dissociative binding energy in Eq. (1) into the predicted thermodynamic potential for segregation in Eq. (2), the following relationship is derived:
Δ

=

+
(

,
(7)
where
Δ
E
vacuum
is the difference in total energy of the surface and subsurface slabs without adsorbates,
Δ
BDE
A
is the difference in binding energy of adsorbate
A
between the surface and subsurface configurations, and
M
is the number of
Pt
–
3
d
metal pairs per unit cell, which in this case is 4 for a
2
×
2
unit cell. By this definition, a positive value for
Δ
E
seg
indicates that the subsurface structure is preferred and a negative value for
Δ
E
seg
indicates that the surface structure is preferred. For all of the
Pt
–
3
d
systems studied,
Δ
E
vacuum
is positive, indicating that the subsurface is preferred in vacuum. Since binding energies are defined to be a negative number, Eq. (7) shows that if the difference in binding energy of
A
between the two configurations is greater than the initial potential for the subsurface when in vacuum, then the surface configuration will be thermodynamically preferred in the presence of adsorbate
A
⁠. Therefore, the instability is not necessarily due to the strength of the adsorbate bond alone but rather due to the difference in the binding energies.
Since the difference in binding energy for oxygen between the two configurations for a given
Pt
–
3
d
system is nearly double the initial potential in vacuum, it is predicted that the
3
d
transition metal will segregate to the surface with adsorbed oxygen. As confirmed experimentally, the
3
d
metals in Pt–Ni–Pt(111), Pt–Co–Pt(111), Pt–Ni–Pt foil, and Pt–Co–Pt foil segregate to the surface when exposed to oxygen. Additionally, the trend of the experimentally determined activation barriers follows the trend predicted by DFT in Fig. 4. DFT predicts that the potential for oxygen-induced segregation increases as
Pt
–
Ni
–
Pt
(
100
)
<
Pt
–
Ni
–
Pt
(
111
)
<
Pt
–
Co
–
Pt
(

⁠, and correspondingly, the activation barrier for this segregation was found to decrease as
Pt
–
Ni
–
Pt
(
100
)
>
Pt
–
Ni
–
Pt
(
111
)
>
Pt
–
Co
–
Pt
(
111
)
⁠. Using the DFT predicted trend and assuming that the segregation on the various systems occurs through homologous reaction pathways, the activation barriers for the
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
systems not studied experimentally can be predicted by using a Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) relationship35,36 written generally as follows:
E
a

γ
(
Δ

E

,
(8)
where
E
a
is the BEP predicted activation barrier,
Δ
E
is the heat of reaction,
γ
is the reaction coefficient, and
E
a
0
is the intrinsic barrier to the reaction. This relationship proposes that homologous reactions should have activation barriers which are linearly related by the heat of reaction,
Δ
E
⁠. Using the three experimentally found activation barriers for Pt–Ni–Pt(111), Pt–Ni–Pt(100), and Pt–Co–Pt(111), along with the respective DFT predicted heat of reaction for each of these systems,
Δ

⁠, the above constants were fitted to this equation and found to be
γ

1.1
and
E

as shown in Fig. 8. This would result in a predicted linear relationship of

a
(

(9)
where
E
a
is the BEP predicted activation barrier for the surface segregation of subsurface
3

metal atoms when exposed to oxygen and
Δ

is the DFT predicted heat of reaction. Using Eq. (9), the activation barriers for all the remaining
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
bimetallic systems on both the (111) and (100) crystal planes can be predicted using
Δ
E
seg
⁠, as shown in Fig. 9. With this correlation, it is predicted that Pt–Ni–Pt(100) is the most stable in oxygen with a BEP estimated activation barrier of
24
kcal
∕
mol
and Pt–Ti–Pt(111) is the most unstable with a BEP estimated activation barrier less than zero, indicating an unactivated process. In general, all of the

systems are predicted to have increased stability over the corresponding

VI. CONCLUSIONS
Based on the DFT calculations and experimental results presented above, the following conclusions can be made regarding the stability of the subsurface
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
configurations in vacuum and with adsorbed oxygen.
The DFT calculations of the oxygen binding energy predict that almost all of the subsurface
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
structures on both Pt(111) and Pt(100) bind oxygen more weakly than Pt(111). All of the surface
3
d
–
Pt
–
Pt
systems for both crystal planes are predicted to bind oxygen much more strongly than Pt(111), which would lead to oxygen poisoning in the cathode environment in PEM fuel cells.
The DFT calculations predict that while the subsurface configuration is thermodynamically stable in a vacuum environment, the surface configuration is preferred with the presence of 0.5 ML O. All of the
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
(
100
)
systems are predicted to be more stable than the respective
Pt
–
3
d
–
Pt
(
111
)
systems. Pt–Ni–Pt(100) is predicted to be the most stable while Pt–Ti–Pt(111) is predicted to be the most unstable.
Experimentally the trend between (111) and (100) was verified for Pt–Ni, with Pt–Ni–Pt(100) having a larger activation barrier to surface segregation in oxygen than Pt–Ni–Pt(111). The relative trend found experimentally on the Pt(111) single crystal remained the same when introducing multiple grain boundaries and crystal planes by using a polycrystalline Pt foil. Therefore, the trends predicted and found experimentally for the model single crystals surfaces will most likely hold when extending model bimetallic systems to nanoparticle electrocatalysts.
