Microscopic Study of Work Function of Ag-Deposited Pt(111) and Ag/Pt Surface Alloy
The microscopic work function distributions of Ag-deposited Pt(111) surfaces and Ag/Pt surface alloy have been studied through local tunneling barrier height (LBH) imaging by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same. This features which occurrs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces.

Japanese Journal of Applied Physics
The Japan Society of Applied Physics (JSAP) serves as an academic interface between science and engineering and an interactive platform for academia and the industry. JSAP is a "conduit" for the transfer of fundamental concepts to the industry for development and technological applications.
JSAP was established as an official academic society in 1946, and since then, it has been one of the leading academic societies in Japan. The society's interests cover a broad variety of scientific and technological fields, and JSAP continues to explore state-of-the-art and interdisciplinary topics.
To this end, the JSAP holds annual conferences; publishes scientific journals; actively sponsors events, symposia, and festivals related to science education; and compiles information related to state-of-the-art technology for the public.

Abstract
The microscopic work function distributions of Ag-deposited Pt(111) surfaces and Ag/Pt surface alloy have been studied through local tunneling barrier height (LBH) imaging by means of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The difference in microscopic work function between Ag and Pt clusters in the Ag/Pt surface alloy is much smaller than that between Ag large islands and Pt terraces on a Ag-deposited Pt(111) surface although their Ag coverages as well as macroscopic work functions are the same. This features which occurrs when the dimensions of the clusters are a few nanometers is due to the long-range effect of work function reduction which is observed for the Cs-adsorption surfaces.
