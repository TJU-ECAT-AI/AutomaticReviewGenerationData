Systems: Understanding the Trends

The development of a fundamental, atomic-level understand-
ing of reactions occurring on electrode surfaces is an impor-
tant goal of electrochemical research. Advances have been
made in this area by employing a combination of experimental
surface science and electroanalytical techniques.[1–8] The use of
computational techniques to study electrochemical phenom-
ena, however, is only in its infancy;[9–13] the complexity of elec-
trochemical systems has thus far prevented the extensive theo-
retical analysis that has been performed for many traditional
catalytic systems.[14] Herein, we show that theoretical methods
can now be used to semiquantitatively describe one of the
simplest electrochemical reactions, the hydrogen evolution re-
action (HER). We present new experimental data for the varia-
tion in the HER exchange-cur-
rent density over a series of bi-
metallic systems with a pseudo-
morphic Pd monolayer at the
surface, and we show that these
data can be understood on the
basis
of
density
functional
theory
(DFT)
calculations.
We
also demonstrate that the basic
origin of the substantial differen-
ces in HER activity that we ob-
serve for Pd on different sub-
strates can be traced to varia-
tions in the electronic structure
of the Pd overlayer.
We performed a series of de-
tailed measurements of the ex-
change-current density for pseudomorphic Pd overlayers on
the close-packed surfaces of Au, Pt, PtRu, Rh, Ir, Ru, and Re
single-crystal transition metal substrates (see Experimental Sec-
tion for details). The experimental results are shown in Figure 1
(see also Table 1). The figure shows that, in spite of the fact
that the electrochemical processes take place on a close-
packed Pd surface layer in each system, the exchange-current
density varies by several orders of magnitude. In the following,
we analyze this result by first showing that DFT calculations
can reproduce the measured variation semiquantitatively and
then using the calculations to identify the physical origin of
the variations in the catalytic activity.
Our discussion will be based on a recently introduced model
that greatly simplifies the analysis of electrochemical sys-
tems.[11,15] The theoretical analysis uses DFT calculations to
compute the free energy of intermediates in surface electro-
chemical processes, and it includes the effects of solvation
(found to be negligible for hydrogen adsorption energies) and
electrode potential. (We note, however, that such potential ef-
fects are by definition absent for exchange-current determina-
tions.) The analysis uses a single catalytic descriptor, the free
energy of hydrogen adsorption (DGH*), to predict trends in the
hydrogen evolution exchange-current density (Figure 2). For
very exothermic hydrogen adsorption (DGH* < 0), the cover-
age of adsorbed hydrogen will be high and will, in essence,
poison the hydrogen evolution process. An expression for the
exchange-current density in this regime is derived in ref. [15]

ð1Þ
where k0, the preexponential factor, is the only unknown pa-
rameter in the model. It has been fitted to experimental data
for the exchange-current density for the elemental metals.[15]
For very endothermic adsorption (DGH* > 0), the model pre-
dicts that a high barrier for H* formation from solvated pro-
tons will lead to low exchange-current densities. A rate expres-
sion in this regime is also derived [Eq. (2)][15]:
i0 ¼ ek0
expðDGH*=kTÞ
1 þ expðDGH*=kTÞ
ð2Þ
For DGH*  0, these two regimes are approximately balanced,
and a maximum in the exchange-current density is predicted.
We have calculated the free energies of hydrogen adsorp-
tion (DGH*) for all the systems considered experimentally (see
Experimental Section for details). For each system, we per-
formed the calculations for different hydrogen coverages (0.25,
0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 monolayers, ML). The coverage (and the asso-
ciated free energy) for a particular system was then deter-
mined self-consistently using the fact that the coverage is
[Eq. (3)][15]:

The term DEHðqHÞ is the coverage-dependent, differential ad-
sorption energy for hydrogen on the surfaces of interest

and DEZPE  TDSH ﬃ0.24 eV is the contribution of zero-point
energy and gas-phase entropy effects to the free energy at
room temperature.[15] Naturally, we are not able to completely
converge Equations (3)–(6), as DFT calculations can only be
performed at a finite number of coverages. Rather, we simply
choose the coverage that gives the best convergence of Equa-
tion (3), and we assume that the number of sites available for
hydrogen adsorption is equal to the number of surface metal
atoms (see ref. [16] for a justification of this assumption). The
resulting coverages are 1 ML (Au, Pt), 0.5 ML (PtRu), and
0.25 ML (Rh, Ir, Ru, and Re). The exchange-current densities are
then calculated with Equations (1) and (2) by using the differ-
ential free energy determined at the appropriate coverage and
the average total site density for the metals of interest (1.5K
1015 cm2).
Clearly, the agreement between the experimental and theo-
retical results is remarkably good. In all cases, the predicted ex-
change-current densities are within a factor of four of the
measured currents. This excellent agreement was obtained
with no curve fitting; the only adjustable parameter (the pre-
exponential factor) was determined independently in ref. [15].
Two data points, Pd*/PtRu and Pd*/Ru, appear to show larger
deviations between theory and experiment than the others.
For the particular case of Pd*/Ru, the DFT calculations seem to
predict an adsorption energy that is too low by approximately
0.04 eV to give quantitative agreement between the model
and the experimental results. Although the discrepancy for the
Pd*/Ru system is larger than the corresponding discrepancies
found for the other systems, it is still quite modest, particularly
given the inherent accuracy of the DFT calculations. (We note,
in passing, that the sensitivity of the predicted exchange-cur-
rent densities to the calculated adsorption energies points to
the need for very accurate DFT treatments to obtain quantita-
tive current-density predictions.) For the very active Pd*/PtRu
alloy, it is known that experimental mass-transfer limitations
may lead to lower measured rates than one would obtain in
the kinetic limit; thus, the indicated experimental data point
only represents a lower bound on the true exchange-current
density. Additionally, small deviations of the structural model
used for the PtRu substrate from the true experimental struc-
ture could conceivably contribute to the observed difference
between the theoretical and experimental results.
Having established that the DFT calculations can account
semiquantitatively for the observed variations in the exchange-
current densities, we can use the calculations to find the
reason for the large variations in the electrocatalytic properties
of Pd overlayers. It has been suggested that the average
energy of the d states projected onto the surface atoms of in-
terest (the local d-band center) should determine the adsorp-
tion properties of transition metal surfaces.[17] In Figure 3, we
show how this works in the present case. There is a clear corre-
lation showing that the higher in energy the d states are, the
stronger the bonds that are formed between adsorbed hydro-
gen atoms and the surface. The quantitative details of this rela-

ers of Pd on the close-packed surfaces of various transition metal substrates.
The hydrogen coverages at which the free energies are evaluated are
0.25 ML for Pd on Re, Ru, Ir, and Rh, 0.5 ML for Pd on a 50:50 PtRu alloy, and
1.0 ML for Pd on Pt and Au. The reference potential is taken as the standard
hydrogen electrode at pH 0.

tionship change somewhat when different hydrogen coverages
are considered, but the general trends are unaltered. This cor-
relation can also be observed for the potentials at which hy-
drogen adsorption occurs.[18] The large variations in the elec-
trocatalytic properties can therefore be correlated to variations
in the electronic structure of the surface atoms. Variations in
the d-band center can be measured either directly by using va-
lence-band photoelectron spectroscopy[18] or by measuring
surface core-level shifts.[19–22] The correlation in Figure 3, to-
gether with the data in Figure 2, therefore suggests a direct
experimental way of assessing variations in the electrocatalytic
properties.
The above results demonstrate that activities for a simple
electrochemical system, the hydrogen evolution reaction on
transition metals, can be predicted semiquantitatively using a
single catalytic descriptor, the free energy of hydrogen adsorp-
tion. This descriptor is related to the basic electronic structure
properties of the metal surfaces, and these properties can, in
turn, be assessed in a straightforward manner with either DFT
calculations or electron spectroscopic measurements. These
methods therefore provide a convenient and efficient means
of evaluating electrochemical properties.
Experimental Section
DACAPO, the total energy calculation code,[23] was used in this
study. A four-layer slab, periodically repeated in a super-cell geom-
etry with six equivalent layers of vacuum between any two succes-
sive metal slabs, was used for all calculations. A 2K2 unit cell was
employed, and the top two layers of the slab were allowed to
relax. Adsorption was allowed on only one of the two exposed sur-
faces, and the electrostatic potential was adjusted accordingly.[24]
Ionic cores were described by ultrasoft pseudopotentials,[25] and
the Kohn–Sham one-electron valence states were expanded in a
basis of plane waves with kinetic energy below 340 eV; a density
cutoff of 500 eV was used. The surface Brillouin zone of close-
packed metal surfaces was sampled at 18 special Chadi–Cohen k
points. In all cases, convergence of the total energy with respect to
the k point set and to the number of metal layers included was
confirmed. The exchange-correlation energy and potential were
described self-consistently within the generalized gradient approxi-
mation (GGA-RPBE).[23] The self-consistent RPBE density was deter-
mined by iterative diagonalization of the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian,
Fermi population of the Kohn–Sham states (kBT=0.1 eV), and Pulay
mixing of the resulting electronic density.[26] All total energies were
extrapolated to kBT=0 eV. The d-band centers were calculated
with a cutoff radius of 1.0 L and an energy window of 15 to
10 eV.
All electrodes in this study (denoted Pd*/X) consisted of a pure,
pseudomorphic monolayer of Pd on the close-packed surfaces of
various substrate metals X; the (111) facets were used for face-cen-
tered cubic (fcc) metals, and the (0001) surfaces were used for hex-
agonal close-packed (hcp) metals. The system Pd*/PtRu was simply
a pure Pd overlayer on the stable, surface-segregated PtRu (1:1)
alloy. We modeled the latter as a Pt skin on a Pt-depleted subsur-
face layer (a Pt coverage of 0.25 ML was used in this layer) with a
terminal substrate layer of the bulk composition.
All substrate electrodes under study were prepared by inductive
annealing and cooling in such a way that atomically clean and
well-ordered surfaces were obtained. The Pt50Ru50 (111) electrode
was cooled in the presence of CO to give segregation of Pt to the
surface.[27] Pd monolayers were prepared either by underpotential
deposition (Au, Pt, Rh, PtRu) or by controlled dissolution of bulk Pd
(Ru, Ir, Re).[4] Simple voltammetric scans into the hydrogen evolu-
tion region at 5 mVs1 were performed after checking for surface
quality and cleanliness in 0.1m H2SO4 by cyclic voltammetry at
room temperature. The potentials were measured against a satu-
rated calomel electrode and corrected for the solution resistance.
Data for overpotentials h<0.15 V were fitted to the cathodic
term of a Butler–Volmer-type equation to obtain experimental
values for the exchange-current densities [Eq. (7)]:

The transfer coefficient a was consistently between 0.4 and 0.5. It
is important to mention that this methodology has limitations for
very active electrode surfaces; that is, j0 values above 1 mAcm2
could not be obtained accurately due to mass transport limitations
and a very high iR drop. The latter meant that overpotentials
<0.15 V could not easily be reached for Pd monolayers on the
Pt surfaces. However, the systematic variation of the exchange-cur-
rent densities could safely be determined. Notably, an exchange-
current density value of about 1.3 mAcm2 for Pd*/Pt was deter-
mined in an independent study by Markovic.[28] This value supports
the present findings and leads to a consistent view for the varia-
tion of activity for hydrogen evolution on the various Pd systems.
To facilitate comparison with the theoretical predictions, the meas-
ured exchange-current densities, determined at pH 1, were adjust-
ed to pH 0 by simple multiplication by the square root of the hy-
drogen ion concentration difference (
