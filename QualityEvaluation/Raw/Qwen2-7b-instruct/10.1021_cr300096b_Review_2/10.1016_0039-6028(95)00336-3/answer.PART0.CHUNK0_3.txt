[1] "The study of binary surface-alloy formation by annealing of thin metallic films on a single-crystal substrate is important from several points of view."
[2] "A series of technological applications, e.g. in catalysis and magnetic recording [1-4], means that these novel systems are particularly attractive."
[3] "From a fundamental point of view we can obtain some insight into the basic physical processes involved in the formation of a surface alloy by studying well-chosen systems."
[4] "It has been shown that a particular surface compound can be related to an energy balance. There is a competition or synergy between three effects [5,6]:the relative surface energies, the mixing enthalpy and the relative size effects."
[5] "Under certain conditions the kinetics of the dissolution of a (finite) thin film into an (infinite) single crystal may be slowed down or even blocked due to the local, i.e. near-surface,interaction of these three effects. The result is called a surface alloy."
[6] "For a binary system AB it matters whether we deposit A on B or vice versa."
[7] "We have studied the CuPt system."
[8] "In this paper we present results obtained on the Cu/Pt(lll) system and compare them with a previous study of the Pt/Cu(lll) surface, using core-level photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and synchrotron radiation."
[9] "The Pt4f7/2 PES results on Pt/Cu(lll) were obtained using an incident photon energy of 155 eV."
[10] "This corresponds to a Cooper minimum for the Pt,thus for the Cu/Pt(lll) measurements we have used a lower photon energy of 115 eV."
[11] "The Fermi level is thus more easily measurable."

To characterize Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, researchers use surface core-level photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) techniques. This method is crucial because it allows scientists to gain insights into the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. By comparing the results with those obtained from Pt/Cu(lll) systems, researchers can better understand the mechanisms governing the formation of surface alloys under different conditions. This information is essential for advancing surface science and catalysis research, as it helps in the development of new materials with tailored properties for various applications.
