[1] "It has been shown that a particular surface compound can be related to an energy balance. There is a competition or synergy between three effects [5,6]:the relative surface energies, the mixing enthalpy and the relative size effects."
[2] "With this in mind we have studied the CuPt system."
[3] "The preparation of the single-crystal Cu and Pt(lll) samples has already been described in detail elsewhere [8];"
[4] "Surface core-level photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out using synchrotron radiation at the Super ACO storage ring, Orsay, France."
[5] "The Pt4f7/2 PES results on Pt/Cu(lll) were obtained using an incident photon energy of 155 eV."
[6] "For the Cu/Pt(lll) measurements we have used a lower photon energy of 115 eV."
[7] "The overall energy resolution (monochromator and electron analyser combined) was 320 and 200 meV, respectively."
[8] "Peak heights typically between 5000 and 10000 counts were recorded."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows researchers to precisely control the composition and structure of the interface, facilitating detailed analysis and prediction of their behavior under various conditions.
