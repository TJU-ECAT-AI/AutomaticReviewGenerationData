The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves using techniques such as surface core-level photoelectron spectroscopy (PES). This process is crucial because it enables detailed structural modeling and computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By examining the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces, researchers gain insights into their behavior and potential applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research.
