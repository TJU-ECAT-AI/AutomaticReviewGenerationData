[3] "The Pt4f7/2 PES results on Pt/Cu(lll) were obtained using an incident photon energy of 155 eV."
[4] "This corresponds to a Cooper minimum for the Pt, thus for the Cu/Pt(lll) measurements we have used a lower photon energy of 115 eV."
[5] "The Fermi level is thus more easily measurable."
[6] "Peak heights typically between 5000 and 10000 counts were recorded."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research because it enables detailed analysis of the surface structure and composition. By using synchrotron radiation for core-level photoemission spectroscopy, researchers can precisely determine the bonding states and concentrations of elements at the surface. The selection of appropriate photon energies, such as 115 eV for Cu/Pt(lll) measurements, ensures that the Fermi level is easily measurable, providing insights into the electronic structure. The typical peak heights ranging from 5000 to 10000 counts indicate the quality and reliability of the data obtained.
