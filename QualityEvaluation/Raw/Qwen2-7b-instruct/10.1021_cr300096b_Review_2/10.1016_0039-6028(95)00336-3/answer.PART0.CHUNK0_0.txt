[1] "The study of binary surface-alloy formation by annealing of thin metallic films on a single-crystal substrate is important from several points of view."
[2] "A series of technological applications, e.g. in catalysis and magnetic recording [1-4], means that these novel systems are particularly attractive."
[3] "With this in mind we have studied the CuPt system."
[4] "In this paper we present results obtained on the Cu/Pt(lll) system and compare them with a previous study of the Pt/Cu(lll) surface, using core-level photoemis- sion spectroscopy (PES) and synchrotron radiation."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research because it allows for the precise control and examination of the interaction between the two metals, providing insights into their unique properties and potential applications in various fields such as catalysis and magnetic recording.
