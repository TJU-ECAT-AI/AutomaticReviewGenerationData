<p>Specifically, we have recently studied the faceting of the W(111) and Mo(111) surfaces as induced by ultrathin films of Pt, Pd, Au, Rh, and Ir. 28-30 These metal-covered bcc(111) surfaces are found, upon high-temperature annealing, to form large scale pyramids (up to a thousand angstroms in size) with faces of {211} orientations as evidenced by both low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>
<p>When annealed to higher temperatures (above 900 K for Rh and Pt, 500 K for Pd) and under certain coverage conditions (as discussed below), LEED shows an n × 1 pattern (n is integer; Figure 6bd), with the direction of the increased period along [011], perpendicular to the closed packed atomic rows of the (211) surface (Figure 1).</p>
<p>For both Pt and Rh, the temperature threshold is found to be 900 K. In comparison, the threshold temperature to induce faceting on the overlayer metal/W(111) system is between 700 and 800 K.28,29</p>
<p>In the case of the Pd/W(211) system, the surface undergoes a different kind of restructuring. For a narrow coverage range that falls between 0.5 and 1 physical monolayers, prominent satellites appear on the LEED pattern next to 1 × 1 diffraction spots (Figure 6d) at temperatures as low as 500 K. These satellites can be interpreted to be caused by a poorly ordered n × 1 superstructure; the spacing between main LEED spots and satellite spots indicates that n is approximately 11.</p>
<p>The surface restructuring process is also kinetically limited as evidenced by the minimum annealing temperature that is needed for the reconstruction to occur. For both Pt and Rh, the temperature threshold is found to be 900 K. In comparison, the threshold temperature to induce faceting on the overlayer metal/W(111) system is between 700 and 800 K.28,29</p>
<p>For the exact structure within the Rh/W(211) reconstruction, (i.e., the elemental identity of atoms within the structure), we suggest two possible interpretations to our STM data. The first is a 3 × 1 superstructure in the Rh overlayer (Figure 8c), where the flat W(211) surface is almost fully covered with Rh except for periodic missing rows. This type of reconstruction does not involve any displacement of the tungsten atoms; the W(211) surface is a rigid substrate for the periodic rearrangement of the Rh atoms only.</p>
<p>Similar ribbon like structures have been observed for many other systems. These include adsorbates forming long chains from one to a few atoms wide (e.g., Gd on W(110) 58), a missing row-type reconstruction of the substrate itself as induced by various adsorbates (e.g., O on Rh(110), 59 alkali metals on Ag(110), 60 or K on Cu(110)5 and Au(110) 61), and the formation of, sometimes truncated, microfacets (e.g., Au on Pd(110)6 or vacuum annealed Ir(110)44).</p>
<p>Note that background gases from the chamber are always found to adsorb on top of the double rows, rather than in between. STM scans on Figure 10 are from a W(211) sample with 3 × 1 superstructure, after it has been exposed to background gases in the vacuum chamber for 3 days. The new bright features on these scans are believed to be adsorbed gas atoms or molecules. Note that background gases always adsorb on top of double rows, rather than in between.</p>
<p>One final argument in favor of the second explanation involves the observation that double rows are stable enough to extend up to 100 Å into neighboring terraces. If the explanation for the 3 × 1 superstructure involves microfaceting of the W(211) surface into a hill-and-valley structure with sides composed of long narrow strips of {011} faces, then the explanation for the stability of such long fringes is the formation of even larger {011} facets (Figure 11).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, typically involves the use of techniques like low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). These methods allow for the detailed analysis of surface structure and composition. High-temperature annealing is crucial for the structural modeling, as it can induce surface reconstruction, such as faceting, which alters the surface morphology. The process helps in understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, which are important for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The temperature thresholds for inducing faceting vary depending on the specific bimetallic system, as shown in the literature, with Pt and Rh requiring higher temperatures compared to the overlayer metal/W(111) system. The restructuring of Pd/W(211) involves a poorly ordered n × 1 superstructure, characterized by satellites in the LEED pattern, which can be associated with microfaceting. The STM observations provide insights into the local atomic structure, suggesting both superstructure formation within the overlayer and microfaceting of the underlying substrate. Background gas adsorption experiments support the microfaceting model, further validating the nature of the surface reconstruction.

对Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征通常涉及低能电子衍射（LEED）、扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和温度程序脱附（TPD）等技术。这些方法允许对表面结构和组成进行详细分析。高温退火对于结构建模至关重要，因为它可以诱导表面重构，如劈裂，从而改变表面形态。这一过程有助于理解这些表面的电子和化学性质，这对于先进的表面科学和催化研究非常重要。不同的双金属系统具有不同的温度阈值来诱导劈裂，其中Pt和Rh需要更高的温度，而覆盖金属/W(111)系统则不同。Pd/W(211)系统的重排涉及到一个不规则的n × 1超结构，其特征是在LEED图案中出现卫星。STM观察提供了有关局部原子结构的见解，这表明不仅在覆盖层中形成了超结构，而且在基底上发生了微劈裂。背景气体吸附实验支持微劈裂模型，进一步验证了表面重构的性质。
