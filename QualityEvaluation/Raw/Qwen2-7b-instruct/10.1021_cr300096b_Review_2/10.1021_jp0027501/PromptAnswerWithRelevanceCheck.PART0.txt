The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying ultrathin metal films up to a few atomic layers thick on atomically rough metal surfaces. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The surfaces undergo massive morphological restructuring under certain conditions, forming large scale pyramids with faces of {211} orientations upon high-temperature annealing. The faceting is caused by the large anisotropy of the surface free energy γ for the adsorbate-covered bcc metal. The study reveals that there is a narrow coverage range where the reconstruction occurs, with a minimum coverage threshold found for the faceting of the metal/W(111) system. On the W(211) surface, overlayer material in excess of one physical monolayer does not form clusters but forms an overlayersubstrate alloy instead.

合成Ni/Pt双金属表面，通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积一层Ni单层，对其表征涉及研究达到几原子层厚的超薄金属薄膜在原子粗糙金属表面。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。这些表面在特定条件下会经历巨大的形貌重构，形成大小达到千埃的金字塔结构，金字塔的面为{211}方向。金字塔化是由覆盖b立方晶体金属表面的吸附剂的表面自由能γ的大各向异性引起的。研究发现，在狭窄的覆盖范围内会发生重构，对于金属/W(111)系统，存在一个最小覆盖阈值。在W(211)表面上，超过一个物理单层的覆盖物不会形成簇，而是形成覆盖物与基体合金。

<p>The clean W(211) surface produces extremely well defined and sharp 1 × 1 LEED patterns (Figure 6a). When a thin film of Rh, Pt, or Pd is deposited onto the surface, the 1 × 1 LEED pattern is essentially conserved, with a slight increase in the diffuse background and a decrease in spot sharpness, indicating a slight disorder of the as-deposited overlayer film because of low adsorbate mobility.</p>
<p>When annealed to higher temperatures (above 900 K for Rh and Pt, 500 K for Pd) and under certain coverage conditions (as discussed below), LEED shows an n × 1 pattern (n is integer; Figure 6bd), with the direction of the increased period along [011], perpendicular to the closed packed atomic rows of the (211) surface (Figure 1).</p>
<p>This result is very similar to observations made by other groups involving oxygen induced restructuring of the W(211) surface,31,38 where several different types of n × 1 superstructures were observed as a function of coverage and annealing temperature.</p>
<p>The surface restructuring process is also kinetically limited as evidenced by the minimum annealing temperature that is needed for the reconstruction to occur. For both Pt and Rh, the temperature threshold is found to be 900 K.</p>
<p>For the exact structure within the Rh/W(211) reconstruction, (i.e., the elemental identity of atoms within the structure), we suggest two possible interpretations to our STM data. The first is a 3 × 1 superstructure in the Rh overlayer (Figure 8c), where the flat W(211) surface is almost fully covered with Rh except for periodic missing rows. This type of reconstruction does not involve any displacement of the tungsten atoms; the W(211) surface is a rigid substrate for the periodic rearrangement of the Rh atoms only.</p>
<p>Similar ribbon like structures have been observed for many other systems. These include adsorbates forming long chains from one to a few atoms wide (e.g., Gd on W(110) 58), a missing row-type reconstruction of the substrate itself as induced by various adsorbates (e.g., O on Rh(110), 59 alkali metals on Ag(110), 60 or K on Cu(110)5 and Au(110) 61), and the formation of, sometimes truncated, microfacets (e.g., Au on Pd(110)6 or vacuum annealed Ir(110)44).</p>
<p>Note that Figure 8d is identical to the microfaceting model postulated earlier for the oxygen induced reconstruction of W(211) (Figure 8b), except for the missing apex Rh atoms. This scenario is more similar to the faceting of W(111) as induced by Pt, Rh, etc.28,29 where tungsten atoms are displaced to form the new surface morphology, whereas the surface is covered (almost) uniformly with a thin film of the overlayer.</p>
<p>The background gases from the chamber are always found to adsorb on top of the double rows, rather than in between. STM scans on Figure 10 are from a W(211) sample with 3 × 1 superstructure, after it has been exposed to background gases in the vacuum chamber for 3 days. The new bright features on these scans are believed to be adsorbed gas atoms or molecules. Note that background gases always adsorb on top of double rows, rather than in between.</p>
<p>The microfaceted structure (Figure 8d) is energetically favorable in comparison with the simple reconstruction of Figure 8c. 70 A second test would be a careful structural study based on LEED (I, V) measurements and a structural calculation or a determination of the surface structure using medium energy ion scattering (MEIS).</p>

<p>Specifically, we have recently studied the faceting of the W(111) and Mo(111) surfaces as induced by ultrathin films of Pt, Pd, Au, Rh, and Ir. 28-30 These metal-covered bcc(111) surfaces are found, upon high-temperature annealing, to form large scale pyramids (up to a thousand angstroms in size) with faces of {211} orientations as evidenced by both low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>
<p>When annealed to higher temperatures (above 900 K for Rh and Pt, 500 K for Pd) and under certain coverage conditions (as discussed below), LEED shows an n × 1 pattern (n is integer; Figure 6bd), with the direction of the increased period along [011], perpendicular to the closed packed atomic rows of the (211) surface (Figure 1).</p>
<p>For both Pt and Rh, the temperature threshold is found to be 900 K. In comparison, the threshold temperature to induce faceting on the overlayer metal/W(111) system is between 700 and 800 K.28,29</p>
<p>In the case of the Pd/W(211) system, the surface undergoes a different kind of restructuring. For a narrow coverage range that falls between 0.5 and 1 physical monolayers, prominent satellites appear on the LEED pattern next to 1 × 1 diffraction spots (Figure 6d) at temperatures as low as 500 K. These satellites can be interpreted to be caused by a poorly ordered n × 1 superstructure; the spacing between main LEED spots and satellite spots indicates that n is approximately 11.</p>
<p>The surface restructuring process is also kinetically limited as evidenced by the minimum annealing temperature that is needed for the reconstruction to occur. For both Pt and Rh, the temperature threshold is found to be 900 K. In comparison, the threshold temperature to induce faceting on the overlayer metal/W(111) system is between 700 and 800 K.28,29</p>
<p>For the exact structure within the Rh/W(211) reconstruction, (i.e., the elemental identity of atoms within the structure), we suggest two possible interpretations to our STM data. The first is a 3 × 1 superstructure in the Rh overlayer (Figure 8c), where the flat W(211) surface is almost fully covered with Rh except for periodic missing rows. This type of reconstruction does not involve any displacement of the tungsten atoms; the W(211) surface is a rigid substrate for the periodic rearrangement of the Rh atoms only.</p>

The new bright features on these scans are believed to be adsorbed gas atoms or molecules. Note that background gases always adsorb on top of double rows, rather than in between.</p>
<p>One final argument in favor of the second explanation involves the observation that double rows are stable enough to extend up to 100 Å into neighboring terraces. If the explanation for the 3 × 1 superstructure involves microfaceting of the W(211) surface into a hill-and-valley structure with sides composed of long narrow strips of {011} faces, then the explanation for the stability of such long fringes is the formation of even larger {011} facets (Figure 11).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, typically involves the use of techniques like low energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD). These methods allow for the detailed analysis of surface structure and composition. High-temperature annealing is crucial for the structural modeling, as it can induce surface reconstruction, such as faceting, which alters the surface morphology. The process helps in understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these surfaces, which are important for advanced surface science and catalysis research. The temperature thresholds for inducing faceting vary depending on the specific bimetallic system, as shown in the literature, with Pt and Rh requiring higher temperatures compared to the overlayer metal/W(111) system. The restructuring of Pd/W(211) involves a poorly ordered n × 1 superstructure, characterized by satellites in the LEED pattern, which can be associated with microfaceting. The STM observations provide insights into the local atomic structure, suggesting both superstructure formation within the overlayer and microfaceting of the underlying substrate. Background gas adsorption experiments support the microfaceting model, further validating the nature of the surface reconstruction.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a detailed analysis of their structural, electronic, and chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it helps in understanding how the individual components interact and influence each other at the atomic level. The ultrathin Ni/Pt bimetallic layers on Pt substrates undergo significant structural changes upon annealing, such as faceting and surface reconstruction, which are critical for their catalytic activity. The driving force behind these changes is the reduction of the total surface free energy, which can be quantified through theoretical calculations employing embedded atom methods or first principles approaches. The anisotropy of the surface free energy plays a key role in these transformations, affecting the stability and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces. The characterization reveals that there is a narrow coverage range for the occurrence of surface reconstruction, which is influenced by factors such as annealing temperature and coverage thresholds. This detailed knowledge is essential for optimizing the properties of these bimetallic systems for applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The mass transport involved in creating the new surface structure, driven by surface diffusion of W atoms, is another aspect of importance, especially considering the role of surface diffusion mechanisms like exchange migration in facilitating the displacement of atoms over longer distances, which is necessary for the development of complex surface morphologies. The annealing process typically involves temperatures above 900 K for Rh and Pt systems, reflecting the thermodynamic conditions required for these transformations to occur efficiently.

我们对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行了详细分析，通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层来合成这些表面。这一过程对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它有助于理解单个组件之间的相互作用及其在原子水平上的影响。Ni/Pt超薄双金属层在Pt基底上的形成会经历显著的结构变化，如劈裂和表面重构，这对于它们的催化活性至关重要。这些变化背后的驱动力是总表面自由能的降低，可以通过嵌入原子方法或第一原理方法进行量化。表面自由能的各向异性在这些转换中起着关键作用，影响着双金属表面的稳定性和反应性。表征揭示了表面重构发生的狭窄覆盖范围，这受因素如退火温度和覆盖阈值的影响。这些详细知识对于优化这些双金属系统的性质以应用于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。创造新表面结构的物质传输过程，由钨原子的表面扩散驱动，是另一个重要的方面，尤其是在考虑到表面扩散机制如交换迁移在促进原子在较远距离上的位移时所扮演的角色，这是发展复杂表面形态所需的关键因素。退火过程通常需要高于900 K的温度，以有效地发生Rh和Pt系统中的这些转变。
