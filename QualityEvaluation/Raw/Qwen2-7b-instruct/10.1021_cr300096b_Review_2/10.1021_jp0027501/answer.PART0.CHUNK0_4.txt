<p>Our group has focused on studying a special class of bimetallic systems: ultrathin metal films, up to a few atomic layers thick, on atomically rough metal surfaces, for example bcc(111).</p>
<p>Specifically, we have recently studied the faceting of the W(111) and Mo(111) surfaces as induced by ultrathin films of Pt, Pd, Au, Rh, and Ir.</p>
<p>These metal-covered bcc(111) surfaces are found, upon high-temperature annealing, to form large scale pyramids (up to a thousand angstroms in size) with faces of {211} orientations as evidenced by both low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</p>
<p>The driving force behind the metal film induced morphological change is understood to be the reduction of the total surface free energy, as supported by theoretical calculations that use either embedded atom methods 35 or a first principles approach. 36</p>
<p>In more general terms, the faceting is caused by the large anisotropy of the surface free energy γ for the adsorbate-covered bcc metal.</p>
<p>Specifically, we have found that there is a narrow coverage range where the reconstruction occurs. In case of the faceting of the metal/W(111) system, a minimum coverage threshold is also found; a high coverage limit, however, has not been observed for that system.</p>
<p>For all three systems, we have found that there is a narrow coverage range where the reconstruction occurs.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing aspects of the microfaceting reconstruction of Rh/W(211) and Pt/W(211) is the significant amount of mass transport involved in creating the new surface structure.</p>
<p>The physical process responsible for the mass transport is surface diffusion of W atoms. The self-diffusion of tungsten has been investigated in great detail using field ion microscopy (FIM).</p>
<p>The displacement of a large number of W row atoms to relatively long distances (the average terrace width is on the order of 100 Å), however, may require higher temperatures to proceed in a short time scale (our annealing times are 2 min).</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through a detailed analysis of their structural, electronic, and chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations because it helps in understanding how the individual components interact and influence each other at the atomic level. The ultrathin Ni/Pt bimetallic layers on Pt substrates undergo significant structural changes upon annealing, such as faceting and surface reconstruction, which are critical for their catalytic activity. The driving force behind these changes is the reduction of the total surface free energy, which can be quantified through theoretical calculations employing embedded atom methods or first principles approaches. The anisotropy of the surface free energy plays a key role in these transformations, affecting the stability and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces. The characterization reveals that there is a narrow coverage range for the occurrence of surface reconstruction, which is influenced by factors such as annealing temperature and coverage thresholds. This detailed knowledge is essential for optimizing the properties of these bimetallic systems for applications in advanced surface science and catalysis research. The mass transport involved in creating the new surface structure, driven by surface diffusion of W atoms, is another aspect of importance, especially considering the role of surface diffusion mechanisms like exchange migration in facilitating the displacement of atoms over longer distances, which is necessary for the development of complex surface morphologies. The annealing process typically involves temperatures above 900 K for Rh and Pt systems, reflecting the thermodynamic conditions required for these transformations to occur efficiently.

我们对Ni/Pt双金属表面进行了详细分析，通过在Pt（111）单晶或多晶Pt基底上沉积一层Ni单层来合成这些表面。这一过程对于结构建模和DFT计算至关重要，因为它有助于理解单个组件之间的相互作用及其在原子水平上的影响。Ni/Pt超薄双金属层在Pt基底上的形成会经历显著的结构变化，如劈裂和表面重构，这对于它们的催化活性至关重要。这些变化背后的驱动力是总表面自由能的降低，可以通过嵌入原子方法或第一原理方法进行量化。表面自由能的各向异性在这些转换中起着关键作用，影响着双金属表面的稳定性和反应性。表征揭示了表面重构发生的狭窄覆盖范围，这受因素如退火温度和覆盖阈值的影响。这些详细知识对于优化这些双金属系统的性质以应用于先进的表面科学和催化研究至关重要。创造新表面结构的物质传输过程，由钨原子的表面扩散驱动，是另一个重要的方面，尤其是在考虑到表面扩散机制如交换迁移在促进原子在较远距离上的位移时所扮演的角色，这是发展复杂表面形态所需的关键因素。退火过程通常需要高于900 K的温度，以有效地发生Rh和Pt系统中的这些转变。
