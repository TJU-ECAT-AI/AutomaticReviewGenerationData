The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves studying ultrathin metal films up to a few atomic layers thick on atomically rough metal surfaces. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The surfaces undergo massive morphological restructuring under certain conditions, forming large scale pyramids with faces of {211} orientations upon high-temperature annealing. The faceting is caused by the large anisotropy of the surface free energy γ for the adsorbate-covered bcc metal. The study reveals that there is a narrow coverage range where the reconstruction occurs, with a minimum coverage threshold found for the faceting of the metal/W(111) system. On the W(211) surface, overlayer material in excess of one physical monolayer does not form clusters but forms an overlayersubstrate alloy instead.

合成Ni/Pt双金属表面，通过在Pt(111)单晶或聚晶Pt基板上沉积一层Ni单层，对其表征涉及研究达到几原子层厚的超薄金属薄膜在原子粗糙金属表面。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及对这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。这些表面在特定条件下会经历巨大的形貌重构，形成大小达到千埃的金字塔结构，金字塔的面为{211}方向。金字塔化是由覆盖b立方晶体金属表面的吸附剂的表面自由能γ的大各向异性引起的。研究发现，在狭窄的覆盖范围内会发生重构，对于金属/W(111)系统，存在一个最小覆盖阈值。在W(211)表面上，超过一个物理单层的覆盖物不会形成簇，而是形成覆盖物与基体合金。
