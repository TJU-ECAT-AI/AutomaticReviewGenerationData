<p>The clean W(211) surface produces extremely well defined and sharp 1 × 1 LEED patterns (Figure 6a). When a thin film of Rh, Pt, or Pd is deposited onto the surface, the 1 × 1 LEED pattern is essentially conserved, with a slight increase in the diffuse background and a decrease in spot sharpness, indicating a slight disorder of the as-deposited overlayer film because of low adsorbate mobility.</p>
<p>When annealed to higher temperatures (above 900 K for Rh and Pt, 500 K for Pd) and under certain coverage conditions (as discussed below), LEED shows an n × 1 pattern (n is integer; Figure 6bd), with the direction of the increased period along [011], perpendicular to the closed packed atomic rows of the (211) surface (Figure 1).</p>
<p>This result is very similar to observations made by other groups involving oxygen induced restructuring of the W(211) surface,31,38 where several different types of n × 1 superstructures were observed as a function of coverage and annealing temperature.</p>
<p>The surface restructuring process is also kinetically limited as evidenced by the minimum annealing temperature that is needed for the reconstruction to occur. For both Pt and Rh, the temperature threshold is found to be 900 K.</p>
<p>For the exact structure within the Rh/W(211) reconstruction, (i.e., the elemental identity of atoms within the structure), we suggest two possible interpretations to our STM data. The first is a 3 × 1 superstructure in the Rh overlayer (Figure 8c), where the flat W(211) surface is almost fully covered with Rh except for periodic missing rows. This type of reconstruction does not involve any displacement of the tungsten atoms; the W(211) surface is a rigid substrate for the periodic rearrangement of the Rh atoms only.</p>
<p>Similar ribbon like structures have been observed for many other systems. These include adsorbates forming long chains from one to a few atoms wide (e.g., Gd on W(110) 58), a missing row-type reconstruction of the substrate itself as induced by various adsorbates (e.g., O on Rh(110), 59 alkali metals on Ag(110), 60 or K on Cu(110)5 and Au(110) 61), and the formation of, sometimes truncated, microfacets (e.g., Au on Pd(110)6 or vacuum annealed Ir(110)44).</p>
<p>Note that Figure 8d is identical to the microfaceting model postulated earlier for the oxygen induced reconstruction of W(211) (Figure 8b), except for the missing apex Rh atoms. This scenario is more similar to the faceting of W(111) as induced by Pt, Rh, etc.28,29 where tungsten atoms are displaced to form the new surface morphology, whereas the surface is covered (almost) uniformly with a thin film of the overlayer.</p>
<p>The background gases from the chamber are always found to adsorb on top of the double rows, rather than in between. STM scans on Figure 10 are from a W(211) sample with 3 × 1 superstructure, after it has been exposed to background gases in the vacuum chamber for 3 days. The new bright features on these scans are believed to be adsorbed gas atoms or molecules. Note that background gases always adsorb on top of double rows, rather than in between.</p>
<p>The microfaceted structure (Figure 8d) is energetically favorable in comparison with the simple reconstruction of Figure 8c. 70 A second test would be a careful structural study based on LEED (I, V) measurements and a structural calculation or a determination of the surface structure using medium energy ion scattering (MEIS).</p>
