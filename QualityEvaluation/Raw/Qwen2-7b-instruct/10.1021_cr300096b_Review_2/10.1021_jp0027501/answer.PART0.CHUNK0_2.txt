<p>The ultrathin metal films are deposited from one of three metal evaporators; two may be cooled by water or liquid nitrogen. A movable quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) may be positioned in front of them for absolute calibration of the metal flux; when dosing the sample, the QCM is moved out of the way.</p>
<p>Outgassing loops enable a thorough degassing of the source without loss of material, and the pressure in the chamber remains below 2 × 10-10 Torr even while dosing Pt at a source temperature of 1700 K.</p>
<p>To minimize sample contamination during overlayer deposition, evaporation rates on the order of one physical monolayer per 10 minutes are used.</p>
<p>Using the evaporator that is directly facing the mass spectrometer, we find that when evaporating Pt and Rh at very high temperatures W may be co-deposited with these metals (from the hot W wire) but only in negligible quantities (<0.5%).</p>
<p>Although QCM data provide an absolute measure of overlayer coverage, subsequent relative coverage measurements are made using temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and/or overlayer-to-substrate peak intensity ratios in AES spectra.</p>
<p>Results are recorded using a single lens reflex camera, fast (ISO1000) film, and long exposure times (0.5 to 3 min).</p>
<p>STM measurements are performed in the second vacuum chamber that has a base pressure below 2 × 10-10 Torr;</p>
<p>In the STM chamber, the sample may be positioned in front of a spiral W filament for electron beam heating, which is used to clean the sample of surface contaminants by flashing the surface to high temperatures (up to 2300 K).</p>
<p>After each annealing step, LEED is used at room temperature to determine changes in the surface morphology.</p>
<p>Results from LEED experiments suggested that the Pd, Rh, or Pt covered W(211) surface undergoes a restructuring upon annealing, which manifests itself in various n × 1 LEED patterns.</p>
<p>STM scans on Figure 10 are from a W(211) sample with 3 × 1 superstructure, after it has been exposed to background gases in the vacuum chamber for 3 days.</p>
<p>Note that background gases always adsorb on top of the double rows, rather than in between.</p>

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and understanding the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces. The ultrathin metal films are deposited using evaporators that can be cooled by water or liquid nitrogen. A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is used for absolute calibration of the metal flux during deposition. Outgassing loops ensure that the source is thoroughly degassed without losing material. Evaporation rates are carefully controlled to minimize contamination, typically at a rate of one physical monolayer per 10 minutes. High temperatures, up to 1700 K, are used for evaporation. The ultrathin films are characterized using techniques like temperature programmed desorption (TPD), AES spectra, STM, and LEED. Background gases are used to further analyze the surface structure and reactivity of the bimetallic surfaces. The deposition and analysis of these surfaces are integral to advancing our understanding of surface science and catalysis research.
