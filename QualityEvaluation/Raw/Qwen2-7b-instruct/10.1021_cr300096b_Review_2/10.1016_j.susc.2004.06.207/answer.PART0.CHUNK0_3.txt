[1] "In performing UHV experiments, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was therefore applied to decorate a metal surface with other metals on heating a sample in the presence of their carbonyl complexes."
[2] "Molybdenum is a highly refractory metal, having a high boiling point; this property imposes a difficulty in physical vapor deposition, for instance, contamination caused by outgassing at elevated temperature."
[3] "We found that Mo(CO)6 adsorbed molecularly on a Pt surface at 100 K and desorbed at 210 K without thermal decomposition."
[4] "Adsorbed Mo(CO)6 undergoes decarbonylation to form surface Mo(CO)x (x  5) under irradiation of ultraviolet light."
[5] "The Mo layer deposited on the Pt surface is nearly free of contamination by C and O."
[6] "Diffusion of resulting Mo adatoms into bulk Pt begins at temperatures above 1070 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through the application of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. This process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of carbonyl complexes as precursors facilitates the deposition of metals without requiring reduction or oxidation reactions, ensuring that the deposition process does not introduce additional contaminants. The results indicate that the deposition of molybdenum on a platinum surface occurs via a photodeposition process, where ultraviolet (UV) light triggers the decomposition of molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6) to form metallic molybdenum adatoms. These adatoms then diffuse into the bulk platinum, forming a nearly contaminant-free molybdenum layer. The deposition process allows for precise control over the composition and structure of the bimetallic surface, which is essential for optimizing the catalytic properties of the materials. The characterization of such surfaces often includes techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the adsorption and decomposition processes, providing insights into the surface chemistry and electronic structure of the bimetallic system.

对于通过在单晶Pt(111)或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层来合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，采用在超高真空（UHV）条件下进行化学气相沉积（CVD）。此过程对于结构建模、密度泛函理论（DFT）计算以及在高级表面科学和催化研究背景下全面理解这些双金属表面的电子和化学性质至关重要。使用羰基复合物作为前体有助于在不涉及还原或氧化反应的情况下沉积金属，确保沉积过程不会引入额外的污染物。结果表明，钼在铂表面上的沉积通过光沉积过程发生，其中紫外线（UV）光触发钼六羰基（Mo(CO)6）的分解形成金属钼原子。这些原子随后扩散到铂的内部，形成几乎不含碳和氧的钼层。沉积过程允许对双金属表面的组成和结构进行精确控制，这对于优化材料的催化性能至关重要。对这些表面的表征通常包括温度程序脱附（TPD）和X射线光电子能谱（XPS）等技术，以研究吸附和分解过程，提供有关表面化学和表面电子结构的见解。
