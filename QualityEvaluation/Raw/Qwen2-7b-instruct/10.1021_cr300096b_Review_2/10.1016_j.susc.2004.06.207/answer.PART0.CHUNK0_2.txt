[1] "Several procedures to produce such bimetallic surface have been reported, using bulk alloys, or adsorption of transition-metal atoms onto bulk Pt by physical, chemical or electrochemical means."
[2] "In the preparation of a catalyst, the Mo crystal was formed via thermal decarbonylation of Mo(CO)6 on surfaces of partially dehydroxylated alumina."
[3] "We found that Mo(CO)6 adsorbed molecularly on a Pt surface at 100 K and desorbed at 210 K without thermal decomposition."
[4] "Adsorbed Mo(CO)6 undergoes decarbonylation to form surface Mo(CO)x (x  5) under irradiation of ultraviolet light."
[5] "In addition, a fraction of the released CO ligands transfers onto the Pt surface and subsequently desorbs at 350550 K."
[6] "The resulting Mo layer deposited on the Pt surface is nearly free of contamination by C and O."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves understanding the adsorption, desorption, and photon-induced decomposition of Mo(CO)6 on a Pt surface. The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. This includes the formation of a Mo crystal via thermal decarbonylation of Mo(CO)6, the adsorption of Mo(CO)6 on the Pt surface at low temperatures without thermal decomposition, the subsequent decarbonylation to form surface Mo(CO)x species under UV irradiation, and the release of CO ligands that can either desorb directly or transfer onto the Pt surface. The resulting Mo layer deposited on the Pt surface is nearly free of contamination by C and O, and the deposited Mo adatoms can diffuse into the bulk Pt at temperatures above 1070 K.

对于通过在Pt(111)单晶或多晶Pt基板上沉积Ni单层合成的Ni/Pt双金属表面的表征，涉及理解Mo(CO)6在Pt表面的吸附、脱附和光诱导分解。这一过程对于结构建模、DFT计算以及我们对这些双金属表面在先进表面科学和催化研究背景下电子和化学性质的全面理解至关重要。这包括通过热解碳酰化形成Mo晶体、在低温下将Mo(CO)6吸附到Pt表面上而无需热分解、在UV照射下通过脱碳酰化形成表面Mo(CO)x物种、释放可以直接脱附或转移到Pt表面的CO配体。沉积在Pt表面的Mo层几乎不含C和O杂质，并且沉积的Mo原子可以在1070 K以上的温度下扩散进入Bulk Pt。
