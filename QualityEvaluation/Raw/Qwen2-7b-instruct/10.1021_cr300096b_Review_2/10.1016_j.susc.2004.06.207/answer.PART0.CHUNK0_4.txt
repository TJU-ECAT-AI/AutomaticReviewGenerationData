The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements. These techniques help understand the surface composition changes during thermal reactions and the photodissociation of Mo(CO)6. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows researchers to assess the purity of the deposited layers, the presence of contaminants, and the diffusion of elements into the bulk substrate.
