The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, involves understanding the adsorption, desorption, and photon-induced decomposition of Mo(CO)6 on a Pt surface. The process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and our comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. This includes the formation of a Mo crystal via thermal decarbonylation of Mo(CO)6, the adsorption of Mo(CO)6 on the Pt surface at low temperatures without thermal decomposition, the subsequent decarbonylation to form surface Mo(CO)x species under UV irradiation, and the release of CO ligands that can either desorb directly or transfer onto the Pt surface. The resulting Mo layer deposited on the Pt surface is nearly free of contamination by C and O, and the deposited Mo adatoms can diffuse into the bulk Pt at temperatures above 1070 K.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is conducted through the application of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. This process is crucial for structural modeling, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The use of carbonyl complexes as precursors facilitates the deposition of metals without requiring reduction or oxidation reactions, ensuring that the deposition process does not introduce additional contaminants. The results indicate that the deposition of molybdenum on a platinum surface occurs via a photodeposition process, where ultraviolet (UV) light triggers the decomposition of molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6) to form metallic molybdenum adatoms. These adatoms then diffuse into the bulk platinum, forming a nearly contaminant-free molybdenum layer. The deposition process allows for precise control over the composition and structure of the bimetallic surface, which is essential for optimizing the catalytic properties of the materials. The characterization of such surfaces often includes techniques like temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the adsorption and decomposition processes, providing insights into the surface chemistry and electronic structure of the bimetallic system.
