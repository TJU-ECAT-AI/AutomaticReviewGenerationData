[1] "In the preparation of a catalyst, the Mo crystal was formed via thermal decarbonylation of Mo(CO)6 on surfaces of partially dehydroxylated alumina [6] ,[7] ."
[2] "We found that Mo(CO)6 adsorbed molecularly on a Pt surface at 100 K and desorbed at 210 K without thermal decomposition."
[3] "Adsorbed Mo(CO)6 undergoes decarbonylation to form surface Mo(CO)x (x ≥ 5) under irradiation of ultraviolet light."
[4] "The Mo layer deposited on the Pt surface is nearly free of contamination by C and O."
[5] "Diffusion of resulting Mo adatoms into bulk Pt begins at temperatures above 1070 K."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces, synthesized by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates, is typically conducted through a combination of techniques including scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations as it allows researchers to understand the precise arrangement of atoms, the chemical bonding environment, and the electronic properties at the interface. This comprehensive understanding is essential for optimizing the performance of bimetallic surfaces in catalytic applications, particularly in advanced surface science and catalysis research where the synergistic effects of different metals can lead to enhanced activity and stability.
