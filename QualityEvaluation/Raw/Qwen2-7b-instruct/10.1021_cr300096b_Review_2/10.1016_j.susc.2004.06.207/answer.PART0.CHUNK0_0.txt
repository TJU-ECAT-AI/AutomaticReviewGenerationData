2. Introduction
"Platinum is the most widely used metallic catalyst in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The addition of a second metal to a Pt cathode can significantly modify catalytic properties of the surface [1] . Much effort has been focused on preparing bimetallic catalysts and examining their chemical and physical properties. Bimetallic Mo/Pt alloys have emerged as an exceptionally active electrode material for oxidation of methanol in aqueous acidic electrolytes [2] ."

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces is conducted by depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for structural modeling, DFT calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of the electronic and chemical properties of these bimetallic surfaces in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. The bimetallic Mo/Pt alloys have emerged as an exceptionally active electrode material for the oxidation of methanol in aqueous acidic electrolytes.
