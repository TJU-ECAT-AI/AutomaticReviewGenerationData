<p>It is well known that the pure Pt(1 0 0) surface reconstructs to a hexagonal surface layer resembling the structure of the Pt(1 1 1) surface.</p>
<p>For the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloy surface, the outer layer with a quasi complete Pt layer exhibits very weakened chemisorptive properties compared to Pt(1 1 1), leading to more selective hydrogenation of butadiene toward butene.</p>
<p>This drastic change is interpreted to be associated with the presence of Ni in the sublayer which imposed a contraction of the bond lengths between the surface Pt atoms with alloying, due to the difference between the lattice parameters of Pt (3.924 Å) and Pt0.5Ni0.5 (3.755 Å).</p>
<p>In the present study, we have studied the adsorption of ethylene and hydrogen on Pt thin films grown on Ni(1 0 0) substrate in order to explore the relation between surface structure and its related electronic states and chemical reactivity of PtNi alloy in an atomic level.</p>
<p>The 1 ML Pt overlayer, as a model (1 0 0) surface of PtNi alloy single crystal, shows a considerable d-band narrowing probably due to the formation of an interface state with the Ni substrate. This greatly weakens the bonding energy of hydrogen atoms as well as ethylene molecule, thus causing the maximum evolution of ethane around 200 K.</p>
<p>In contrast, the development of a wide d-band extending to 6 eV binding energy characteristic of bulk Pt electronic states upon increasing the Pt coverage from 1 to 6 ML, leads to a similar surface chemistry of ethylene as on Pt(1 1 1) surface.</p>

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on a Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates to understand their structural, electronic, and chemical properties. This process is crucial for structural modeling and DFT calculations in advanced surface science and catalysis research.

2. The importance of this process lies in elucidating how the electronic structure of the topmost Pt layer of the alloy is modified, influencing the surface chemistry and reactivity. By examining the model system, it becomes evident that the high reactivity for hydrogenation reactions originates from the alteration of the electronic structure in the topmost Pt layer of the alloy.
