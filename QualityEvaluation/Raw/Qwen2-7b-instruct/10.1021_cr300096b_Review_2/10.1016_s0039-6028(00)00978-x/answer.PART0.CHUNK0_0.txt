[1] "The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously [8] ."
[2] "It is well known that the pure Pt(1 0 0) surface reconstructs to a hexagonal surface layer resembling the structure of the Pt(1 1 1) surface."
[3] "The first Pt overlayer represents suitably a model surface of alloys showing particular properties quite different from those of bulk Pt."
[4] "The 1 ML Pt overlayer, as a model (1 0 0) surface of PtNi alloy single crystal, shows a considerable d-band narrowing probably due to the formation of an interface state with the Ni substrate."
[5] "The influence of the topography of the substrate on the bonding and reactivity has been shown upon the adsorption of ethylene molecule on these surfaces."

Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the structural, electronic, and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows for the creation of a model surface that can be used for DFT calculations and structural modeling, providing insights into the effects of the substrate's topography on bonding and reactivity. The 1 ML Pt overlayer acts as a model for a PtNi alloy single crystal surface, demonstrating d-band narrowing due to interface states with the Ni substrate. This influences the bonding strength of adsorbates such as hydrogen and ethylene, affecting the surface chemistry and reactivity. The adsorption of ethylene molecules on these surfaces is influenced by the substrate's topography, impacting the stability and reactivity of adsorbates.
