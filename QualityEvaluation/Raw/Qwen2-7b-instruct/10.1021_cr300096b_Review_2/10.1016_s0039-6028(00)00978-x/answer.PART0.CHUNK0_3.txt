[1] "Bimetallic catalysts are often used in industrial reactions in order to improve the activity and/or selectivity."
[2] "Among these systems, it has been found that PtNi alloy single crystal surfaces show surface enrichment of one component, depending on the surface orientation; i.e., Pt enrichment at the first layer and Ni enrichment in the second layer for (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, reverse order for (1 1 0) surface."
[3] "It is expected that the substrate can set an epitaxial relation to the overlayer which would cause severe strain as similar to the PtNi alloys having higher Ni bulk content, because the Ni substrate has an about 10% shorter lattice parameter than the Pt overlayers."
[4] "The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously."
[5] "The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or resistively heated to 1200 K."
[6] "The cleanliness was checked by XPS."
[7] "These are in agreement with the values reported in the literature on Pt(1 1 1) [10] and Ni(1 0 0) [11] ."
[8] "The Pt atoms in the first monolayer are bonding with the substrate Ni atoms rather than the neighboring Pt atoms."
[9] "In this respect, this state resembles that observed as an interface state in the system Pt/Co(0 0 0 1) where the interface state has mainly the character of the overlayer (Pt 5d), despite its strong hybridization with the substrate [17] ."
[10] "These considerations will be exemplified in the TPD experiments shown below."
[11] "This weakening of hydrogen-surface bonding at the first layer of Pt is consistent with the chemisorptive properties of the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloys where it has not been possible to detect any adsorption except CO [21] ,[22] ."
[12] "In this respect, the first Pt overlayer represents suitably a model surface of alloys showing particular properties quite different from those of bulk Pt."
[13] "The observed shift in the desorption temperature corresponding to the weakened bonding of ethylene molecule also shows a nice agreement with the chemisorptive properties of the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloys described above."

1. The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the structural, electronic, and chemical properties of these surfaces, particularly in the context of advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows for detailed analysis and comparison with theoretical models and previous studies.

2. The synthesis of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces through depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystals or polycrystalline Pt substrates is essential for modeling their structure, conducting Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and gaining a comprehensive understanding of their electronic and chemical properties. This method helps researchers to predict and explain the behavior of these surfaces under various conditions, contributing to advancements in catalysis and surface science.
