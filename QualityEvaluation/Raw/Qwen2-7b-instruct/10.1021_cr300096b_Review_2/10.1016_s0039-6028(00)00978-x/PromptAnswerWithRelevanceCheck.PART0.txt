Characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces involves depositing a Ni monolayer on Pt(111) single crystal or polycrystalline Pt substrates. This process is crucial for understanding the structural, electronic, and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces in advanced surface science and catalysis research. It allows for the creation of a model surface that can be used for DFT calculations and structural modeling, providing insights into the effects of the substrate's topography on bonding and reactivity. The 1 ML Pt overlayer acts as a model for a PtNi alloy single crystal surface, demonstrating d-band narrowing due to interface states with the Ni substrate. This influences the bonding strength of adsorbates such as hydrogen and ethylene, affecting the surface chemistry and reactivity. The adsorption of ethylene molecules on these surfaces is influenced by the substrate's topography, impacting the stability and reactivity of adsorbates.

The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously [8] . The system is equipped with facilities for X-ray and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS and UPS) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) with a cap shield for temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and two pulse valves for gas dosing. The system base pressure is 5×108 Pa. MgKα radiation (1253.6 eV) and He discharge lamp (21.2 eV) were used as photon sources for XPS and UPS. Photoelectrons were collected with a hemispherical analyzer. Its energy resolution was around 1 eV (XPS) and 0.5 eV (UPS). Angle-resolved UPS measurements at a given azimuth were accomplished by varying the angle between the sample normal and the detector direction. The angles were measured with respect to the sample normal. TPD measurements were made using the QMS in line of sight with the sample surface and using a linear heating rate of 23 K/s. The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or resistively heated to 1200 K. The temperature was measured by a chromelalumel thermocouple spotwelded to the side edge of the crystal.

The Ni(1 0 0) crystal was cleaned by repeated Ar ion sputtering and annealing at 1200 K procedures. Pt was evaporated from a tungsten filament containing a Pt wire by resistive heating on the clean Ni(1 0 0) surface kept at room temperature. Because of the carbon contamination resulting from each adsorption and subsequent TPD experiment, the Pt thin films were used as grown newly prepared for each experiment. Pt was removed by Ar ion sputtering and annealing at 1200 K. The cleanliness was checked by XPS. Research grade reactant gases purchased from Takachiho Co. were used without further purification.

The characterization of Ni/Pt bimetallic surfaces was conducted through a series of experiments performed in a stainless steel ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber. This chamber was equipped with various tools such as X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS), low energy electron diffraction (LEED), a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) for temperature programmed desorption (TPD), and pulse valves for gas dosing. The system maintained a base pressure of 5×10^-8 Pa. The photon sources for XPS and UPS were MgKα radiation at 1253.6 eV and a He discharge lamp at 21.2 eV. Photoelectrons were collected using a hemispherical analyzer with an energy resolution of approximately 1 eV for XPS and 0.5 eV for UPS. Angle-resolved UPS measurements were performed by adjusting the angle between the sample normal and the detector direction. TPD measurements utilized the QMS in line of sight with the sample surface and employed a linear heating rate of 23 K/s. The Ni(1 0 0) crystal could be cooled to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or heated to 1200 K via resistive heating, with temperature measured by a chromelalumel thermocouple spotwelded to the crystal side edge. Prior to the experiments, the Ni(1 0 0) crystal underwent cleaning through repeated Ar ion sputtering and annealing at 1200 K. Pt was deposited on the clean Ni(1 0 0) surface at room temperature using a tungsten filament containing a Pt wire, with resistive heating. Each Pt thin film was freshly prepared for each experiment due to carbon contamination from adsorption and subsequent TPD experiments. After use, the Pt films were removed through Ar ion sputtering and annealing at 1200 K, with cleanliness confirmed by XPS. High-purity reactant gases from Takachiho Co. were used without further purification.

为了表征Ni/Pt双金属表面，研究团队在不锈钢超高真空（UHV）腔室中进行了系列实验。该腔室配备了多种工具，包括X射线和紫外光电子能谱（XPS和UPS）、低能电子衍射（LEED）、四极质谱（QMS）用于温度程序脱附（TPD），以及脉冲阀用于气体给药。系统保持基压为5×10^-8帕斯卡。XPS和UPS的光子源分别为1253.6 eV的MgKα辐射和21.2 eV的He放电灯。使用一个半球形分析器收集光电子，其能量分辨率为大约1 eV（XPS）和0.5 eV（UPS）。通过调整样品正常方向和检测器方向之间的角度进行角度分辨的UPS测量。TPD测量利用QMS与样品表面成直线视图进行，并采用23 K/s的线性加热速率。Ni(1 0 0)晶体可以通过液氮冷却至100 K或通过电阻加热至1200 K，温度由焊接到晶体侧边缘的铬铝热电偶测量。在实验前，Ni(1 0 0)晶体通过重复氩离子溅射和1200 K退火进行清洁。通过钨丝包含铂线的钨丝在室温下的铂薄膜沉积在干净的Ni(1 0 0)表面上，通过电阻加热。由于吸附和随后的TPD实验产生的碳污染，每项实验均使用新鲜制备的铂薄膜。使用完后，通过氩离子溅射和1200 K退火去除铂薄膜，清洁度通过XPS确认。来自Takachiho Co.的高纯度反应性气体在实验中未进一步净化即被使用。

[1] "Bimetallic catalysts are often used in industrial reactions in order to improve the activity and/or selectivity."
[2] "Among these systems, it has been found that PtNi alloy single crystal surfaces show surface enrichment of one component, depending on the surface orientation; i.e., Pt enrichment at the first layer and Ni enrichment in the second layer for (1 0 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces, reverse order for (1 1 0) surface."
[3] "It is expected that the substrate can set an epitaxial relation to the overlayer which would cause severe strain as similar to the PtNi alloys having higher Ni bulk content, because the Ni substrate has an about 10% shorter lattice parameter than the Pt overlayers."
[4] "The experiments were performed in a stainless steel UHV chamber as described previously."
[5] "The Ni(1 0 0) crystal can be cooled down to 100 K using liquid nitrogen or resistively heated to 1200 K."
[6] "The cleanliness was checked by XPS."
[7] "These are in agreement with the values reported in the literature on Pt(1 1 1) [10] and Ni(1 0 0) [11] ."
[8] "The Pt atoms in the first monolayer are bonding with the substrate Ni atoms rather than the neighboring Pt atoms."
[9] "In this respect, this state resembles that observed as an interface state in the system Pt/Co(0 0 0 1) where the interface state has mainly the character of the overlayer (Pt 5d), despite its strong hybridization with the substrate [17] ."
[10] "These considerations will be exemplified in the TPD experiments shown below."
[11] "This weakening of hydrogen-surface bonding at the first layer of Pt is consistent with the chemisorptive properties of the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloys where it has not been possible to detect any adsorption except CO [21] ,[22] ."
[12] "In this respect, the first Pt overlayer represents suitably a model surface of alloys showing particular properties quite different from those of bulk Pt."
[13] "The observed shift in the desorption temperature corresponding to the weakened bonding of ethylene molecule also shows a nice agreement with the chemisorptive properties of the Pt0.5Ni0.5 (1 1 1) alloys described above."
