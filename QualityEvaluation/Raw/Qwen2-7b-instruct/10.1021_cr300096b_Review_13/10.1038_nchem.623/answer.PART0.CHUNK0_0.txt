<p>Considering the dimensions across which ensemble, geometric strain and ligand effects are effective, only geometric strain can impact surface reactivity over more than a few atomic layers.</p>
<p>To date, however, no effective strategy to isolate and tune strain effects in electrocatalytic systems has been achieved.</p>
<p>We showed that dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles have uniquely high catalytic reactivity for the oxygen-reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cell electrodes...</p>
<p>Specifically, we hypothesize that lattice strain in the Pt shell controls the surface catalytic reactivity.</p>
<p>From these combined, consistent results, we conclude that the geometry of the dealloyed Pt-enriched shell on the PtCu core leads to the high electrocatalytic activity.</p>
<p>The observed synthesisstrain trends are understood within our coreshell model.</p>
<p>For the film with maximum strain, the antibonding resonance vanishes in the XAS spectrum and is resolved in the XES spectrum, which directly indicates that the antibonding state is occupied fully with a peak around 1.5 eV below the Fermi level.</p>
<p>Finally, we correlated experimental synthesisstrainactivity data of dealloyed coreshell particles (Fig. 6).</p>
<p>In conclusion, a coherent picture of the origin of the exceptional electrocatalytic reactivity for the ORR of dealloyed PtCu particles is now established.</p>
<p>This represents the first direct experimental confirmation of the computational prediction of band shifts of adsorbate-projected band structure.</p>
<p>The resulting activitystrain relationships provide experimental evidence that the deviation of the Pt-shell lattice parameter from that of bulk Pt, that is the lattice strain in the shell, is the controlling factor in the catalytic enhancement of dealloyed Pt nanoparticles.</p>

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by influencing the electronic structure of the catalyst surface. This, in turn, affects the adsorption properties of rate-limiting intermediates in catalytic processes. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are profound, as it allows for precise control over the surface reactivity by adjusting the lattice strain in the shell of the bimetallic particles. This control leads to enhanced catalytic activity, as demonstrated by the observed relationships between strain and activity in dealloyed PtCu nanoparticles.

In essence, the lattice strain in the Pt shell modifies the d-band structure of the Pt atoms, weakening the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates compared to unstrained Pt, thus increasing the catalytic reactivity. This phenomenon offers a pathway for continuous tuning of catalytic reactivity in electrocatalytic systems, providing a unified principle for the optimization of catalyst performance in various electrocatalytic reactions that require the modification of the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在Pt-3d系统中的亚表面3d原子中，对氢化反应中的模型表面和支持催化剂之间的强相关性有重要影响。这主要通过改变催化剂表面的电子结构来实现，进而影响催化过程中的限速中间体的吸附性质。这种相关性对于使用模型表面的原理设计更有效的催化剂具有深远的意义，因为它允许对壳层中双金属粒子的表面反应性进行精确控制。这种控制导致增强的催化活性，正如在脱合金化PtCu纳米颗粒中观察到的关系所示，这些关系是通过调整Pt壳层的晶格应变与活动之间的联系得出的。

简而言之，Pt壳层中的晶格应变修改了Pt原子的d带结构，减弱了活性中间体相对于未变形Pt的吸附能，从而增加了催化活性。这一现象提供了一种连续调节催化活性的方法，在各种需要修改活性中间体吸附能的电催化反应中优化催化剂性能提供了统一的原则。
