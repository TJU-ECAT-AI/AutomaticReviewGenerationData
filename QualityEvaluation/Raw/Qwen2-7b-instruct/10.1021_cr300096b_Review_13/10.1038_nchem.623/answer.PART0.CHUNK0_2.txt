The literature discusses how the lattice strain in the Pt shell of dealloyed PtCu particles plays a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It explains that lattice strain in the Pt shell modifies the d-band structure of the Pt atoms, weakening the adsorption energy of reactive intermediates compared to unstrained Pt, thus increasing the catalytic reactivity. The literature also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying principles that govern the performance of electrocatalytic systems, as this knowledge can guide the design of more effective catalysts. The researchers used various techniques, including X-ray diffraction, X-ray spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculations, to measure and quantify the lattice strain in the Pt shell and correlate it with the electrocatalytic activity of the dealloyed PtCu particles. The results suggest that controlling the extent of lattice strain in the Pt shell can be a powerful tool for tuning the activity of electrocatalysts for the ORR and potentially other electrocatalytic reactions.

文献讨论了在去合金化PtCu粒子的Pt壳中的晶格应变如何显著增强氧还原反应（ORR）的电催化活性。它解释说，Pt壳中的晶格应变修改了Pt原子的d带结构，与未受约束的Pt相比，减弱了反应中间体的吸附能，从而增加了催化活性。文献强调理解指导电催化剂性能的原理的重要性，因为这可以指导设计更有效的催化剂。研究人员使用各种技术，包括X射线衍射、X射线光谱和密度泛函理论计算，来测量和量化Pt壳中的晶格应变，并将其与电催化活性相关联。结果表明，控制Pt壳中晶格应变的量可以作为调节ORR和其他电催化反应电催化剂活性的强大工具。
