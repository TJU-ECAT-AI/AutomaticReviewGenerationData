[1] "Considering the dimensions across which ensemble, geometric strain and ligand effects are effective, only geometric strain can impact surface reactivity over more than a few atomic layers."
[2] "The preferential dissolution (removal) of the electrochemically more reactive component from a bimetallic alloy (precursor) that consists of a less reactive (here Pt) and more reactive metal (here Cu)21,22,23 is commonly referred to as dealloying."
[3] "To realize similar property improvements in related electrocatalytic systems, the principles that underlie their performance must be elucidated."
[4] "The lattice mismatch between the Pt shell and the PtCu core causes a reduced PtPt interatomic distance in the shell."
[5] "The observed synthesisstrain trends are understood within our coreshell model."
[6] "We extended and applied these ideas to single-crystal Pt surfaces by preparing and characterizing bimetallic single-crystal model surfaces that consist of atomic layers of Pt with various thicknesses grown on a Cu(111) substrate."
[7] "Our computations showed a linear relationship between lattice strain and the adsorbate bond energy, consistent with the experimental X-ray spectroscopy data and previous computational analyses16,44."
[8] "The resulting activitystrain relationships provide experimental evidence that the deviation of the Pt-shell lattice parameter from that of bulk Pt, that is the lattice strain in the shell, is the controlling factor in the catalytic enhancement of dealloyed Pt nanoparticles."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by allowing for the precise control of surface strain. This control enables the modification of adsorption energies of reactive intermediates, enhancing catalytic reactivity. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are profound. It suggests that by manipulating the lattice parameters of the bimetallic structure, one can fine-tune the catalytic properties for hydrogenation reactions. This approach allows for the creation of catalysts with enhanced performance tailored to specific reaction conditions.

Answer: The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures facilitates the precise control of surface strain, which in turn modifies the adsorption energies of reactive intermediates, enhancing catalytic reactivity. This correlation has significant implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, enabling the creation of catalysts with enhanced performance tailored to specific reaction conditions.
