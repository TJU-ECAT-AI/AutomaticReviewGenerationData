[1] "In this study, we investigated the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, and found a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This correlation implies that insights gained from studying model surfaces can be directly translated to designing more effective catalysts using first principles."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms contributes to a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows for the direct translation of insights from model surfaces to the design of more effective catalysts using first principles.
