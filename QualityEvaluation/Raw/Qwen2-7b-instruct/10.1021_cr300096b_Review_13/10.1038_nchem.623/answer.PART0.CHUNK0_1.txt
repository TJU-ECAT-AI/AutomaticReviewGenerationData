[3] "The preferential dissolution (removal) of the electrochemically more reactive component from a bimetallic alloy (precursor) that consists of a less reactive (here Pt) and more reactive metal (here Cu)21,22,23 is commonly referred to as dealloying."

[9] "We combined synthesis, measurements and an understanding of strain from theory to generate a reactivitystrain relationship that provides guidelines for tuning electrocatalytic activity."
[10] "The resulting activitystrain relationships provide experimental evidence that the deviation of the Pt-shell lattice parameter from that of bulk Pt, that is the lattice strain in the shell, is the controlling factor in the catalytic enhancement of dealloyed Pt nanoparticles; in particular, these relationships are consistent with computational predictions that compressive strain enhances ORR activity."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions because these structures enable the lattice strain in the Pt shell to control the surface catalytic reactivity. This is due to the lattice mismatch between the Pt shell and the PtCu core, causing a reduced Pt-Pt interatomic distance in the shell. The lattice strain in the shell, especially compressive strain, enhances the surface catalytic reactivity, aligning with computational predictions. This correlation facilitates the design of more effective catalysts by leveraging first principles on model surfaces, allowing for the precise control of catalyst properties and activity.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，尤其是在Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的情况下，促进了模型表面和支撑催化剂在氢化反应中的强相关性，因为这些结构使Pt壳中的晶格应变能够控制表面催化活性。这是由于Pt壳与PtCu核心之间的晶格不匹配导致壳内的Pt-Pt原子间距减小。壳中的晶格应变，尤其是压缩应变，增强了表面催化活性，与计算预测相一致。这种相关性使得通过模型表面的第一原理设计更有效的催化剂成为可能，允许对催化剂性质和活性进行精确控制。
