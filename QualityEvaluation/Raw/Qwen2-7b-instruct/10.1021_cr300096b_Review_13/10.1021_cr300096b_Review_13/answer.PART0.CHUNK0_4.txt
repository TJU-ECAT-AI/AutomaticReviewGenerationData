[1] "Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."
[2] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the designed catalysts closely mimic the behavior of real catalysts under reaction conditions, facilitating the rational design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. This correlation implies that models accurately predict the performance of actual catalysts, enabling more effective catalyst design.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是Pt-3d系统中表面Pt层下的3d原子，对氢化反应中的模型表面和支持催化剂之间的强相关性起着重要作用。这种稳定性确保设计的催化剂在真空高和氢化反应条件下都能保持稳定，从而在模型表面上使用第一原理设计催化剂时，能够准确预测实际催化剂的行为。这种相关性意味着模型能够准确预测催化剂的实际性能，为更有效地设计催化剂提供了可能。
