          "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."
          "The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions."

      <English>
          The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially those in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and during the actual hydrogenation reactions, which facilitates the design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

          "However, it is less clear whether these structures are present under dehydrogenation and reforming reaction conditions."
          "More studies are needed to determine the structures and their stability in other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts."

      <English>
          While the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures is crucial for hydrogenation reactions, its presence and stability under dehydrogenation and reforming reaction conditions are less clear. Further research is necessary to understand the structures and their stability in other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts.

          "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."
          "Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

      <English>
          The strong correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions can be attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms. Examples like the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon and carbon-monoxide bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials further illustrate how these models can predictably design catalysts that perform well in real-world applications.
