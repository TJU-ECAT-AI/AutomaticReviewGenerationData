[1] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under both ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and during hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that by designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, researchers can accurately predict and optimize the performance of supported catalysts in real-world applications. Future research opportunities include characterizing bimetallic catalysts under in situ reaction conditions, synthesizing stable bimetallic structures, utilizing metal carbides as substrates in bimetallic catalysts, and correlating model systems with catalytic reactions through theoretical calculations.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在表面Pt层下具有3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，对氢化反应中模型表面与支持催化剂之间的强相关性做出了重大贡献。这种稳定性保证了在超高真空(UHV)环境和氢化反应条件下，所需结构保持不变。这种相关性意味着，通过在模型表面上使用第一原理设计催化剂，研究人员可以准确预测和优化实际应用中的支持催化剂性能。未来研究机会包括在原位反应条件下表征双金属催化剂、合成稳定的双金属结构、利用金属碳化物作为双金属催化剂的基底、以及通过理论计算将模型系统与催化反应相关联。
