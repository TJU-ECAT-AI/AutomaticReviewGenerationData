The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and during the hydrogenation reactions. As a result, when designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, these stable structures predictably translate to effective performance in real-world applications, facilitating the rational design of more effective catalysts.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在表面Pt层下的3d原子下面的3d原子系统中，对氢化反应中模型表面和支持催化剂之间的强烈相关性贡献巨大。这种稳定性保证了在超高真空(UHV)环境和氢化反应过程中这些理想结构的保持。因此，在使用模型表面进行第一原理设计时，这些稳定的结构可以预测地转化为实际应用中的有效性能，从而促进更有效的催化剂的理性设计。
