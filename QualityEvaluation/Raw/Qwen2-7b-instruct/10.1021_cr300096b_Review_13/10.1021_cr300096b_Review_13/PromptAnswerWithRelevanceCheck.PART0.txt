<quotes>
The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and during the hydrogenation reactions. As a result, when designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, these stable structures predictably translate to effective performance in real-world applications, facilitating the rational design of more effective catalysts.

[1] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."
[2] "However, it is less clear whether these structures are present under dehydrogenation and reforming reaction conditions."
[3] "Similarly, more studies are needed to determine the structures and their stability in other Pt-based bimetallic catalysts."

1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions because these structures remain stable under both UHV conditions and during the actual hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desirable structures found in model surfaces can effectively translate to real-world catalyst performance, facilitating the rational design of catalysts from first principles.

2. It is uncertain if the same stability is observed in dehydrogenation and reforming reaction conditions for the desirable Pt3d bimetallic structures. Further studies are required to determine if these structures are present under such conditions and to assess their stability. This lack of clarity hinders the extension of bimetallic catalyst design from hydrogenation to other types of reactions.

1. 在氢化反应中，特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是铂-3d系统中位于表面铂层下的3d原子，对于模型表面和实际催化剂之间的强相关性至关重要。这些结构在高真空环境和氢化反应条件下都保持稳定，这确保了模型表面上发现的结构能够有效地转化为实际催化剂性能，从而为从第一原理构建催化剂提供了可能。

2. 对于脱氢和重整反应条件下的有利Pt3d双金属结构，其稳定性尚不明确。需要进一步的研究来确定这些结构是否存在于此类条件下以及它们的稳定性如何。这种不确定性阻碍了将双金属催化剂设计从氢化扩展到其他类型反应的可能性。
