[1] "Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."
[2] "The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."
[3] "For other types of reactions, such as dehydrogenation and reforming, the desirable Pt3d bimetallic structures should be the 3d-terminated surfaces."
[4] "Such understanding is critical in extending the design of bimetallic catalysts from hydrogenation to other types of reactions."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions because these structures remain stable under both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environments and hydrogenation reaction conditions. This stability ensures that the model surfaces accurately represent the supported catalysts' behavior, allowing for the effective design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. Understanding this correlation is crucial for extending the design of bimetallic catalysts to other types of reactions beyond hydrogenation.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，尤其是在表面Pt层下具有3d原子的Pt-3d系统中，对于氢化反应中的模型表面和支持催化剂之间的强相关性至关重要，因为这些结构在超高真空(UHV)环境和氢化反应条件下保持稳定。这种稳定性确保模型表面准确反映了支持催化剂的行为，使得能够利用模型表面的第一原理设计催化剂。理解这种相关性对于将双金属催化剂的设计扩展到氢化反应之外的其他类型反应至关重要。
