Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

[Fundamentals of Industrial Catalytic Processes (Second Edition) is a definitive instructional and reference text that has been written for a broad chemical science and engineering audience. The text has been authored with a balanced academic and industrial perspective of industrial catalysis by authors who have been instrumental in advancing the discipline. This book directly addresses the academic need for a comprehensive course text, while providing a level of information and detail for several industrially relevant processes that will be of particular interest to the practising chemist and engineer. The result is a very readable and comprehendible text for the engineer and chemist alike, which is based on a foundation of using fundamental aspects of reaction engineering and heterogeneous catalysis for industrial design and optimization of industrial catalytic processes.]

[The book is separated into two sections, and begins with a summary of reaction engineering and catalysis fundamentals (chapters 15), followed by relevant industrial examples of heterogeneously catalyzed processes (chapters 613).]
