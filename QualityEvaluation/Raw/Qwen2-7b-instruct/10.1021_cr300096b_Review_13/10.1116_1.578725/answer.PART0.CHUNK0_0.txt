[1] "Tungsten and tungstencarbon thin films have been produced from a W target sputtered in argon and argonmethane mixtures, respectively."
[2] "The deposition rate of W films was measured as a function of the sputtering power and argon pressure varying in the range of 0.33 Pa."
[3] "The crystallographic structure and composition of W films deposited on silicon and carbon substrates were investigated by xray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy."
[4] "Below 25 at.% of carbon, the structure of the WC films was that of the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter."
[5] "For higher carbon concentrations, the bcc αW phase disappeared and the structure was that of the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase."
[6] "The structure of WC films with a carbon content greater than 65 at.% was nearly amorphous."
[7] "Internal stresses and electrical resistivity of WC films were determined as functions of the carbon concentration."

The document describes the production of tungsten and tungsten-carbon thin films through magnetron sputtering. It investigates the deposition rate of tungsten films as a function of sputtering power and argon pressure. The crystallographic structure and composition of these films, both on silicon and carbon substrates, are analyzed using x-ray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. The document also discusses how the structure of tungsten-carbon films changes with the carbon concentration, ranging from cubic αW phase at lower carbon concentrations to nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase at higher concentrations. Furthermore, the internal stresses and electrical resistivity of tungsten-carbon films are determined as functions of the carbon concentration.
