[1] "The adsorption on the alumina, at either 200 or 300C, is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on:alumina catalyst."
[2] "The adsorption at 200 is higher than at 300, indicating that the adsorption is exothermic."
[3] "The adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum is about an order of magnitude less than for the platinum-on-alumina catalyst."
[4] "Perhaps this is due to the much lower concentration of metal employed in the case of platinum (2% vs. 10%)."
[5] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x."
[6] "The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by affecting the dispersion of the active metal. The literature indicates that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. This leads to differences in the catalytic activity of the supported platinum catalysts. The specific catalytic activity of the platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support, implying that the support affects the degree of platinum dispersion rather than intrinsic catalytic properties. The correlation suggests that designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces could lead to better understanding and optimization of dispersion effects, potentially improving catalyst performance. The implications for designing effective catalysts include focusing on controlling metal dispersion through support choice, which can enhance catalytic activity without altering the intrinsic activity of the active metal.

特定二元金属结构的热力学稳定性，尤其是在Pt-3d系统中具有次表面3d原子的情况下，通过影响活性金属的分散性，在氢化反应中建立了模型表面和支撑催化剂之间的强烈相关性。文献表明，铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于在硅酸铝上。这导致了支持铂催化剂活性的差异。铂的特定催化活性对于环己烷脱氢化几乎不受支撑的影响，暗示支撑影响铂的分散度而非内在催化性质。相关性表明，利用模型表面的第一原理设计更有效的催化剂可以更好地理解并优化分散效应，从而提高催化剂性能。设计有效催化剂的含义包括关注通过选择支撑来控制金属分散性，这可以增强催化活性而无需改变活性金属的基本活性。
