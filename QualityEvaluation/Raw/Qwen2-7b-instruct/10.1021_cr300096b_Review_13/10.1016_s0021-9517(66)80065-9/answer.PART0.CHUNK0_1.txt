"From the isotherms in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the adsorption on the alumina, at either 200 or 300C, is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on:alumina catalyst. The adsorption on the alumina is also seen to increase with increasing temperature."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by influencing the adsorption behavior of reactants and products on the catalyst surface. The stability of these structures affects the surface energy and reactivity, leading to distinct adsorption patterns. This correlation implies that the performance of a catalyst can be effectively predicted and optimized by studying model surfaces, which mimic the real catalyst surfaces at a smaller scale. The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces involve a detailed understanding of the interaction energies, electronic structures, and adsorption/desorption processes on the catalyst surface.

在Pt-3d系统中，特别是在具有亚表面3d原子的双金属结构中，热力学稳定性促进了氢化反应中模型表面与支持催化剂之间的强相关性。这种稳定性影响了反应物和产物在催化剂表面上的吸附行为，进而决定了表面能和反应活性，导致了明显的吸附模式差异。这种相关性意味着通过研究模型表面可以有效地预测和优化催化剂性能，因为模型表面可以以较小的尺度模拟实际催化剂表面。使用第一原理在模型表面上设计更有效的催化剂的含义涉及深入理解表面相互作用能量、电子结构以及吸附/脱附过程。
