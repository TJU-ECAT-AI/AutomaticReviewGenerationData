[1] "The effect of the difference in platinum dispersion on catalytic activity is shown by data on the rate of cyclohexane dehydrogenation to benzene over the two platinum catalysts. The data are given in Table 1."
[2] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[3] "The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that the design of more effective catalysts can be improved by understanding and utilizing first principles on model surfaces. The implications of this correlation include the ability to predict and optimize catalytic activity based on the structure of the catalyst at the atomic level, leading to the development of catalysts with enhanced performance.
