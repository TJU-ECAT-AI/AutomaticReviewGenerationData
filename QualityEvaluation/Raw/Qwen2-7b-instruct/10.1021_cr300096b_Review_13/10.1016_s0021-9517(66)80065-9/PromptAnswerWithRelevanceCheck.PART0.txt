[1] "The chemisorption results indicated that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina."
[2] "For the platinum-on-alumina catalyst, the adsorption of hydrogen on platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole."
[3] "The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."
[4] "The activity of the platinum-on-alumina catalyst was about six times as high as that of the platinum on silica-alumina."
[5] "There is little doubt that the major reason for the difference in catalytic activity is the difference in the platinum surface area on the two supports."

1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions because the platinum is dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. This leads to enhanced interaction between the metal and the substrate, which affects the adsorption and desorption processes of hydrogen molecules. Consequently, the specific catalytic activity of the platinum for hydrogenation reactions is influenced by the support material, affecting the rate of dehydrogenation.

2. The implication of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces is that understanding the precise relationship between the metal dispersion, surface area, and the support material can guide the development of catalysts with optimized activity and selectivity. By carefully controlling the deposition and reduction processes, researchers can tailor the catalyst's performance for specific reactions.

3. The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions suggests that the design of catalysts should consider the interplay between the metal species, support materials, and the surface chemistry. This can lead to the creation of catalysts with enhanced performance for hydrogenation and related reactions, potentially increasing efficiency and reducing costs in industrial applications.

1. 在Pt-3d系统中，特别是具有亚表面3d原子的双金属结构的热力学稳定性，对于氢化反应中模型表面与支持催化剂之间的强相关性做出了贡献，因为铂在氧化铝上的分散程度远高于二氧化硅氧化铝。这导致了金属和基底之间增强的相互作用，影响了氢分子的吸附和脱附过程。因此，铂在氢化反应中的特定催化活性受到支持材料的影响，影响脱氢速率。

2. 对于使用模型表面设计更高效催化剂的含义在于，理解金属分散、表面积和支撑材料之间精确关系可以指导为特定反应开发催化剂的方式。通过仔细控制沉积和还原过程，研究者可以定制催化剂的性能以适应氢化和其他反应。

3. 氢化反应中模型表面与支持催化剂之间的强相关性表明，在设计催化剂时应考虑金属物种、支撑材料以及表面化学之间的相互作用。这可能导致具有增强性能的催化剂的创建，用于氢化及相关反应，从而提高效率并降低工业应用的成本。

"From the isotherms in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the adsorption on the alumina, at either 200 or 300C, is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on:alumina catalyst. The adsorption on the alumina is also seen to increase with increasing temperature."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by influencing the adsorption behavior of reactants and products on the catalyst surface. The stability of these structures affects the surface energy and reactivity, leading to distinct adsorption patterns. This correlation implies that the performance of a catalyst can be effectively predicted and optimized by studying model surfaces, which mimic the real catalyst surfaces at a smaller scale. The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces involve a detailed understanding of the interaction energies, electronic structures, and adsorption/desorption processes on the catalyst surface.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by affecting the dispersion of the active metal. The literature indicates that the platinum was dispersed to a much higher degree on alumina than on silica-alumina. This leads to differences in the catalytic activity of the supported platinum catalysts. The specific catalytic activity of the platinum for cyclohexane dehydrogenation is essentially unaffected by the support, implying that the support affects the degree of platinum dispersion rather than intrinsic catalytic properties. The correlation suggests that designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces could lead to better understanding and optimization of dispersion effects, potentially improving catalyst performance. The implications for designing effective catalysts include focusing on controlling metal dispersion through support choice, which can enhance catalytic activity without altering the intrinsic activity of the active metal.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The thermodynamic stability of the platinum structure on alumina leads to a higher degree of dispersion of platinum, which affects the catalytic activity of the catalyst. This is because the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole. This indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the platinum structure on alumina contributes to its higher catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation compared to the same metal on silica-alumina.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalytic activity of the platinum catalysts was calculated by determining the dehydrogenation rates at low conversion levels (less than 10%). These rates were calculated as the product of the amount of cyclohexane fed per hour (F) and the weight of the catalyst in grams (W), multiplied by the fractional conversion (x).

铂催化剂的催化活性通过在低转化率（小于10%）下确定脱氢速率来计算。这些速率被计算为每小时添加的环己烷的数量（F）和催化剂重量（W）的乘积，再乘以转化率（x）。
