"From the isotherms in Fig. 1, it can be seen that the adsorption on the alumina, at either 200 or 300C, is small compared to the adsorption on the 2% platinum-on:alumina catalyst. The adsorption on the alumina is also seen to increase with increasing temperature."

The thermodynamic stability of the platinum structure on alumina leads to a higher degree of dispersion of platinum, which affects the catalytic activity of the catalyst. This is because the adsorption of hydrogen on the platinum at moderately high surface coverage (70%) is estimated to be exothermic to the extent of 7-8 kcal/mole. This indicates that the thermodynamic stability of the platinum structure on alumina contributes to its higher catalytic activity for cyclohexane dehydrogenation compared to the same metal on silica-alumina.

在铝氧化物上的铂结构的热动力学稳定性导致铂的更高分散度，这影响了催化剂的活性。这是因为氢在铂表面覆盖率为70%时的吸附被认为是放热的，程度为7-8 kcal/mole。这表明在铝氧化物上的铂结构的热动力学稳定性对其与硅铝酸盐相比更高的环己烷脱氢化催化活性做出了贡献。

"The rates of dehydrogenation were determined at low conversion levels (< 10%), and were calculated as the product of the quantity, F/W, and the fractional conversion, x,where F represents the moles of cyclohexane charged per hour and W is the weight of catalyst in grams."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The catalytic activity of the platinum catalysts was calculated by determining the dehydrogenation rates at low conversion levels (less than 10%). These rates were calculated as the product of the amount of cyclohexane fed per hour (F) and the weight of the catalyst in grams (W), multiplied by the fractional conversion (x).

铂催化剂的催化活性通过在低转化率（小于10%）下确定脱氢速率来计算。这些速率被计算为每小时添加的环己烷的数量（F）和催化剂重量（W）的乘积，再乘以转化率（x）。
