<p>The adsorption of hydrogen and deuterium has been investigated on the (111) surfaces of several groups 4 and 5 single-crystal carbides, TiC(111), ZrC(111), HfC(111), NbC(111), and TaC(111). Several surface techniques have been employed, including impact-collision ion-scattering spectroscopy (ICISS), ARPES, LEED, reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). In all of these studies, the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen was observed at room temperature.</p>
<p>On the (100) surfaces of TiC, ZrC, HfC, NbC, and TaC, the dissociative adsorption of oxygen often resulted in changes in the electronic states of TMC surfaces. For example, photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of oxygen adsorption on ZrC(100) revealed that the formation of a ZrO-like layer altered the surface electronic structure, making the electronic properties of ZrO-ZrC(100) similar to those of ZrC(111).</p>
<p>The chemisorption and decomposition of CO on TMC surfaces have been extensively investigated to determine the relative electron accepting and donating capability of the substrate, as well as to illustrate the changes in reactivity upon carbide modification. Previous theoretical studies by Jansen and Hoffmann revealed a significant reduction in the ability of the TiC(100) substrate to donate electrons into the 2π* antibonding orbitals of CO when compared with that of Ti(0001).</p>
<p>The formation of carbide on early transition metals leads to the onset of the Pt-like properties. However, the differences in the thermal stability and adsorption orientation of ethylidyne also reveal that the chemical properties of the two types of surfaces are not identical.</p>
