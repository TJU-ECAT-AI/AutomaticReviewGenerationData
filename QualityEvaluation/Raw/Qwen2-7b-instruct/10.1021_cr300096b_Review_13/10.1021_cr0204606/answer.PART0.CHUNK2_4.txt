The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation permits the application of surface property insights from model surfaces to predict and enhance the performance of supported catalysts in practical scenarios. This understanding facilitates the design of more efficient catalysts through the strategic manipulation of surface structure and metal interactions.
