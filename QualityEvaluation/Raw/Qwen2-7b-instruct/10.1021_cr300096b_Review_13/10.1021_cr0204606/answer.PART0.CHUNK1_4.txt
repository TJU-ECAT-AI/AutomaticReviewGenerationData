[1] "The presence of carbon in TMC can induce both electronic and structural modifications, at least in the following three effects: (1) The electronic interaction between the valence states of carbon and the parent metal modifies the density of states near the Fermi level. (2) The incorporation of carbon typically increases the metalmetal distance as compared to that of the parent metal, which causes a tensile strain in the metal lattice and should lead to additional modification of the metal d-band. (3) The presence of carbon atoms in or on the surface reduces the number of surface metal sites available for the adsorption and subsequent reactions of molecules. All three effects should lead to modifications of the surface reactivity of TMCs compared to their parent metal surfaces."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions through modifying the density of states near the Fermi level, causing a tensile strain in the metal lattice, and reducing the number of surface metal sites available for adsorption and reactions. These modifications lead to altered surface reactivity of transition metal carbides (TMCs) compared to their parent metal surfaces, facilitating a better understanding of catalyst design.

特定双金属结构，特别是Pt-3d系统中的亚表面3d原子，通过修改费米能级附近的密度态、在金属晶格中产生拉应力以及减少表面金属位点的数量，促进了模型表面和支撑催化剂在氢化反应中的强相关性。这些修改导致过渡金属碳化物（TMC）的表面反应性与它们的母金属表面不同，这有助于催化剂设计的理解。
