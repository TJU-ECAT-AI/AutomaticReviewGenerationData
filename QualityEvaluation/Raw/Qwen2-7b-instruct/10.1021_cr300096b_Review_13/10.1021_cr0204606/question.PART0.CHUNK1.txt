Cyclohexene has been used as a probe molecule to differentiate the surface activity of C/W(111)155 and C/W(110). 156 In general, the reaction pathways of cyclohexene on C/W(111)155 were similar to those on C/Mo(110).152,153 Gas-phase benzene desorbed from C/W(111) at 300 K at 67% selectivity. Parallel studies on the C/W(110) surface illustrated the substrate-dependent reaction pathways of cyclohexene.156 While the C/W(110) surface was still active toward the decomposition of cyclohexene, it was unlike either C/W(111) or C/Mo(110) in that only between 7 and 18% of the adsorbed cyclohexene dehydrogenated to produce benzene. A possible explanation for the differences in product distribution between C/W(110) and C/W(111) may involve the location of the carbon atoms. In these comparative studies, both C/W(111) and C/W(110) were annealed to 1200 K to produce the carbide-modified surfaces. The (111) plane of tungsten has an open-structured surface, which would allow the carbon atoms to situate between the metal atoms. Since W(110) is a closed-packed surface, carbon would most likely act as site-blockers on top of metal atoms. Furthermore, one would expect the surface reactivity of C/W(110) and C/Mo(110) to be relatively similar, since both W and Mo are group 6 metals with an identical crystal structure and similar atomic radius.156 The observed differences between the two surfaces were related to the temperatures that were required to induce the inward diffusion of surface carbon. Thermal studies have shown that C/Mo(110) did not exhibit Pt-like reactivity until the surface was annealed to 1200 K.152,153 The importance of the annealing process was that some of the surface carbon atoms diffused into interstitial sites, enabling surface Mo atoms to react with cyclohexene. Previous AES experiments, however, have shown that carbon did not diffuse inward on W(110) until above 1531 K. 157 As a result, the C/W(110) surface after annealing to 1200 K did not possess the Pt-like dehydrogenation selectivity due to the site-blocking by surface carbon on W(110).156 The reaction of cyclohexene has also been utilized as a probe to determine the effect of oxygen modification on the reactivity of C/W(111),95 C/Mo(110),55 and C/Ti(0001)94 using TPD and HREELS. The motivation to undertake this study was due to the fact that during catalytic processes the surfaces of TMCs are often oxidized by air or by oxygen-containing reactants and products, leading to the formation of the so-called oxycarbide. Several research groups have reported that the catalytic properties of powder carbides can be significantly modified by the presence of oxygen. 158-161 As discussed earlier in Figure 2, the adsorption of oxygen on C/Mo(110) at 600 and 900 K led to oxygen residing in different bonding environments,55 which was also confirmed in the dissociation of oxygen on C/W(111) at 600 and 900 K.95 Correspondingly, thermal desorption studies following cyclohexene adsorption on the 600 K O/C/Mo(110) and O/C/W(111) surfaces showed only reversible molecular desorption. In contrast, oxygen modification at 900 K resulted in oxygen occupying either the twofold, threefold, or interstitial sites, but not the terminal on-top sites. AES measurements also revealed a reduction in the atomic C/W ratio after oxygen modification at 900 K. These results suggested that surface carbon was removed by oxygen via the formation of gas-phase CO at 900 K, and subsequently some oxygen occupied the sites left vacant by carbon. For example, quantitative analysis (Table 5) showed that, on the 900 K O/C/W(111) surface, 83% of the cyclohexene dehydrogenated to yield gas-phase benzene, which was higher than the 67% selectivity observed on unmodified C/W(111).95 The dehydrogenation of cyclohexene has also been investigated on Pt-modified C/W(111) surfaces. 162 The motivation for supporting submonolayer Pt onto the C/W(111) surface was to determine the feasibility of using carbide as a catalytic support. Studies comparing the reactivity of Pt-modified C/W(111) with those of clean C/W(111) and Pt(111) demonstrated an enhancement toward the production of benzene from cyclohexene. On submonolayer Pt-modified C/W(111), the selectivity toward gas-phase benzene formation was at 86%,162 which was higher than that on either Pt(111) (25%)148,149,151 or C/W(111) (67%).155 One possible explanation for the enhancement toward benzene production was that the energy barrier for benzene desorption was reduced on Pt/C/W(111) relative to the Pt(111) surface.162 This assertion was supported by the observation that benzene desorption was reaction-limited at 290 K on Pt/C/W(111)162 but desorption-limited at 400 K on Pt(111).148,149,151 The lower barrier for benzene desorption prevented the subsequent thermal decomposition of the surface benzene intermediate, leading to a higher selectivity toward gas-phase benzene.162 Cyclohexene has also been used as a probe to study the effect of carbide modification on Ni, 163 a late transition metal. An epitaxial Ni thin film was prepared by depositing Ni atoms onto a Pt(111) surface until Pt signals were no longer detectable within the Auger probing depth. LEED experiments verified the Ni/Pt(111) surface to be essentially a Ni(111) film.150,163 A carbon overlayer similar to those described for early transition metals was then prepared by decomposing ethylene or cyclohexene. Alternatively, carbide layers can also be grown on a Ni surface by the Boudouard reaction, 2CO(g)  C(ads) + CO2(g). 164,165 Unlike those on early transition metals, the carbon overlayer on Ni was carbidic at 600 K but changed to graphitic when heated to 900 K. On both carbide- and graphite-modified Ni surfaces, benzene desorption was observed following cyclohexene dehydrogenation; however, the overall activity toward cyclohexene was reduced by a factor of 2.2 upon graphite formation. HREELS results further demonstrated that the surface benzene intermediate was bonded differently onto carbide- and graphite-modified Ni surfaces.163 Additional studies on other late transition metal carbide surfaces may help identify general similarities and differences between the surface reactivities of early and late transition metal carbides.
Reactions of TMC surfaces with other cyclic molecules, such as cyclopropane, 166 cyclopentene,53 cyclohexane, 167 cyclohexadiene,153 and cycloheptatriene, 168 have also been investigated. For example, the thermal behavior of 1,3-cyclohexadiene on the C/Mo(110) surface was similar to that observed for cyclohexene.153 On clean Mo(110), 1,3-cyclohexadiene primarily underwent complete decomposition, with only trace amounts of gas-phase benzene detected over a broad temperature range between 200 and 400 K. On C/Mo(110), however, a benzene desorption peak was observed at 313 K. Detailed vibrational studies revealed additional differences in the decomposition pathways of cyclohexadiene on the two surfaces. Following adsorption at 80 K on clean Mo(110), cyclohexadiene immediately dehydrogenated to form benzene. Heating to 300 K resulted in an HREEL spectrum consistent with the presence of a benzyne (C6H4) intermediate. On the other hand, surface benzene species were not observed on the C/Mo(110) surface upon cyclohexadiene adsorption. By 300 K, the HREEL spectrum appeared to resemble that of a phenyl intermediate.153
4.3. Aromatics
There has been an abundance of literature detailing the adsorption of benzene on transition metal surfaces. 169-171 These studies revealed that benzene typically adsorbed with the molecular plane nearly parallel to the substrate at low coverages and that the out-of-plane CH bending mode (ν4 according to the Herzberg notation) of adsorbed benzene correlated with the strength of the benzenemetal interaction. Studies on clean and carbide-modified Mo(110) showed that benzene also adsorbed with the molecular plane parallel to the surface; 172 however, the approximately linear correlation between the vibrational frequency of the ν4 mode and the cohesive energy of the metal substrate could not be extended to include the C/Mo(110) surface. Furthermore, the comparative study also revealed different decomposition mechanisms for benzene on the two surfaces. On clean Mo(110), chemisorbed benzene remained stable until 325 K, above which it decomposed to a benzyne intermediate. In contrast, C2H and CH fragments were produced on the C/Mo(110) surface upon heating to 470 K. The latter decomposition pathway was similar to that observed on Rh(111), 173 providing another example of similar activity between C/Mo(110) and Pt-group metal surfaces.
The adsorption of benzene on clean and carbide-modified W(211) was examined as part of the acetylene cyclotrimerization studies.130 Benzene did not bond with the molecular plane parallel to the clean W(211) surface, as evidenced by the presence of an intense ν(CH) mode at 3051 cm-1 and the lack of a strong angular dependence for all benzene vibrations. These HREELS results were consistent with a tilted adsorption geometry for benzene, which may be attributed to the row-and-trough structure of clean W(211). Interestingly, the presence of carbon atoms on the C/W(211) surface appeared to smooth the surface, which led to the adsorption of benzene in the parallel adsorption geometry on C/W(211).130 More studies are needed to determine whether the smoothing behavior is due to an electronic modification or a physical reconstruction of the corrugated W(211) surface.
ARPES studies of benzene on WC(0001) have been reported by Brillo and co-workers. 106,174 Evidence of benzene decomposition on clean WC(0001) was observed at 210 K. The photoemission spectrum of the surface intermediate at this temperature was virtually identical to that obtained following ethylene decomposition on WC(0001). At temperatures above 300 K, the CxHy fragments further dehydrated to produce surface carbon. Additional studies on oxygen-modified WC(0001) showed a reduced strength of the benzenesubstrate interaction with increasing oxygen coverage.106,174 The adsorption and decomposition of phenyl iodide (C6H5I) over the Mo2C/Mo(100) surface were investigated by Solymosi and co-workers using TPD, XPS, and HREELS. 175 At 100 K and at submonolayer coverages, phenyl iodide adsorbed molecularly with the aromatic ring parallel to the surface. The scission of the CI bond occurred between 162 and 300 K, resulting in the formation of surface phenyl species. The majority of the phenyl species hydrogenated to form gas-phase benzene at 290 K. The remaining surface species further dehydrogenated to produce benzyne, followed by additional dehydrogenation steps leading to hydrogen desorption at 600 K and above. The photolysis of the C6H5I layer on Mo2C/Mo(100) by UV light was also investigated, which led to the CI bond scission at temperatures as low as 100 K.175
5. Reactions with Oxygen-Containing Molecules
5.1. Water
A detailed understanding of the reaction of water on carbide surfaces is of practical significance in two areas, tribology 176,177 and fuel cells.110-112 Investigations into the chemical reactivity of TiC and VC surfaces with respect to their use as coatings in tribological applications have been reported recently. 178,179 Perry and co-workers observed four molecular desorption states of deuterated water at 188, 233, 263, and 308 K on TiC(100) at saturation exposure.179 XPS studies showed the formation of three adsorbed species at low temperatures: atomic O, partially dissociated hydroxyl groups, and molecular water.178 Heating the surface resulted in the desorption of D2, CO, and CO2 species. The desorption peaks of CO and CO2 spanned across a wide temperature range from 173 to 773 K, while the D2 desorption peak was relatively weak and was detected at 500 K. HREEL spectra obtained following the adsorption of D2O on TiC(100) showed evidence of some OD bond dissociation at 144 K. The authors also assigned the vibrational modes at 710 and 2100 cm-1 to the stretching modes of TiD and TiCD, respectively, which were consistent with the dissociative adsorption of D2O. Spectral changes upon heating to higher temperatures included the disappearance of molecular features and an increase in the intensity of the TiO stretch at 980 cm-1.178,179 Studies comparing the reaction of water on TiC(100) and VC(100) led to the conclusion that the low-temperature decomposition was more extensive on TiC(100).178 Similar to the case on the TiC(100) surface, TPD experiments also revealed four molecular desorption states on VC(100) at 175, 202, 243, and 283 K. A major difference between the two surfaces was that molecular desorption occurred mainly above 200 K on TiC(100) but below 200 K on VC(100). TPD studies showed the evolution of gas-phase hydrogen and the formation of stable VO species between 300 and 400 K. Unlike the case on TiC(100), carbon from the VC(100) substrate did not react with adsorbed water or hydroxyls to produce gas-phase CO and CO2.178 These studies could provide insights into the interaction between coating materials and their respective lubricants. For example, the ability of VC to form a stable VO may be an attractive characteristic for applications requiring oxygen-resistant coatings.178 XPS and UPS studies of the reactivity of water on the ZrC(100) surface have been reported by Edamoto and co-workers. 180,181 As described earlier, these authors showed that the (100) plane of ZrC was inactive toward CO and hydrogen as a result of a relatively small DOS around EF.104 Similarly, water did not adsorb on ZrC(100) at room temperature; however, when a well-ordered suboxide-like layer was formed on ZrC(100), the surface became significantly more active toward water dissociation.180,181 Furthermore, XPS and UPS measurements provided evidence supporting the dissociative adsorption of water at room temperature to form atomic oxygen and surface hydroxyl species.
The ability of carbide surfaces to decompose water is important in direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) applications. Specifically, water dissociates to produce surface hydroxyl groups, which then react with adsorbed CO to desorb as CO2.107,108 This is a critical reaction in DMFCs because it removes the CO surface intermediate from poisoning the fuel cell electrocatalyst and it generates two of the six electrons in the overall electrooxidation of a methanol molecule.107,108 To determine the feasibility of using tungsten carbides as potential electrocatalysts in DMFCs, the reaction of water has been studied on carbide-modified W(111)110,111 and W(110).110,112 On the clean W(111) and W(110) surfaces, decomposition of water was apparent even at liquid nitrogen temperature, as evident by the formation of surface OH species. Heating the adsorbed layer resulted in the desorption of hydrogen and the accumulation of atomic oxygen on the surface. Quantitative calculations showed a decomposition activity of 0.32 water molecules per W atom on both surfaces. On the carbide-modified surfaces, both substrates showed a reduction of 50% in the activity toward water dissociation. The TPD measurements also revealed differences in both the hydrogen desorption peak shape and temperature from C/W(111) and C/W(110). The corresponding HREEL spectra monitoring the decomposition of water on C/W(110) showed only a very weak ν(OH) mode while the same mode on C/W(111) was relatively prominent. The combined analysis of HREELS and TPD results suggested that the evolution of gas-phase hydrogen was reaction-limited on C/W(111) but desorption-limited on C/W(110),110-112 indicating the structure dependence of the dissociation of water on the tungsten carbide surfaces.
Coadsorption experiments of CO and H2O were also conducted on C/W(111) and C/W(110) to determine whether the formation of CO2 occurred under UHV conditions.111,112 Although the presence of surface hydroxyls led to a decrease in the CO desorption temperatures, the TPD and HREELS experiments did not detect the desorption of CO2 or the formation of surface CO2 intermediates.
The interaction between water and C/Mo(110) 182 was carried out as an extension to the studies on C/W(111) and C/W(110). The surface science work was motivated by the electrochemical studies of Kudo et al.,9-11 who incorporated molybdenum carbides into tungsten carbides as a promoter in DMFC systems. The presence of Mo carbides was suggested either to aid in the removal of surface poisons or to alter the reaction pathways leading to the inhibition of poisonous species.9-11 Using identical experimental conditions to those for C/W(111) and C/W(110), the TPD results showed the decomposition activity on the Mo(110) substrate to be less affected by carbide modification than that on the tungsten surfaces.182 Specifically, the decomposition activity of water on C/Mo(110) was approximately 73% of that on the Mo(110) surface; this was in contrast to the 50% value on the C/W surfaces.110-112 The enhanced ability of the C/Mo(110) surface to dissociate water, relative to that on C/W(111) and C/W(110) surfaces, could possibly promote the removal of CO adsorbed on the electrocatalyst surface.182
5.2. Alcohols
The reactions of methanol on transition metal and metal oxide surfaces have been investigated extensively.138,139 One of the underlying motivations for these studies was to understand the mechanisms of the FischerTropsch reaction. 183,184 These studies have provided a significant reference base to compare the reaction pathways of methanol on TMCs with those of the corresponding metal and metal oxide surfaces.
The adsorption and reaction of methanol on TiC(100) have been investigated using HREELS, XPS, and TPD.183 CH3OH adsorbed dissociatively to form methoxy on the TiC(100) surface at temperatures as low as 153 K, as suggested by the absence of the ν(OH) vibrational mode of molecular methanol. As the surface temperature increased from 190 to 300 K, the methoxy species recombined with hydrogen to desorb as methanol. At temperatures above 300 K, small amounts of gas-phase hydrogen and methane were observed from the surface, which were attributed to the decomposition of methanol at defect sites. Comparative studies were conducted on VC(100) to examine the effect of substrate electronic structure on the decomposition of methanol.183 As mentioned earlier, VC(100) possesses an additional 3d valence electron per formula unit when compared to TiC(100). HREELS results following methanol adsorption on VC(100) showed that, at low temperatures, the scission of the OH bond to form methoxy was less extensive than that on TiC(100). When samples were heated to higher temperatures, recombinative methanol desorption was observed between 300 and 500 K. Unlike that on TiC(100), however, a significant percentage of adsorbed methoxy underwent further decomposition to yield gas-phase formaldehyde and hydrogen, along with a small amount of methane and surface oxygen. The authors attributed the formation of formaldehyde from VC(100) to the interaction between the methyl group of methoxy and the surface metal states.183 To compare carbide-modified surfaces with bulk carbide single crystals, Zellner et al. investigated the reaction of methanol on carbide-modified Ti(0001) and V(110) surfaces. 185 There were general similarities between the carbide-modified surfaces and the corresponding bulk crystals in terms of the methanol reaction pathways. For example, the dissociation of methanol to methoxy was observed on C/Ti(0001) at liquid nitrogen temperature, with most of the methoxy species recombining with surface hydrogen to desorb as methanol at higher temperatures. In contrast, a significant fraction of methanol adsorbed on C/V(110) without the scission of the OH bond at liquid nitrogen temperature, although all the surface methoxy species underwent complete decomposition at higher temperatures without desorbing as methanol. These reaction pathways were very similar to those on bulk TiC(100) and VC(100) surfaces183 described in the previous paragraph; however, the C/Ti(0001) and C/V(110) surfaces appeared to be much more reactive than the TiC(100) and VC(100) surfaces in terms of the fraction of methanol that underwent complete decomposition.183,185 This is likely due to the fact that the Ti(0001) (hcp structure) and V(110) (bcc structure) substrates have the sixfold or quasi-sixfold symmetry. The corresponding C/Ti(0001) and C/V(110) surfaces will therefore resemble the sixfold symmetry of the (111) surfaces of TiC and VC, which should be more active than the corresponding (100) surfaces.183,185 Edamoto and co-workers conducted UPS measurements following methanol adsorption on TiC(100) and TiC(111) surfaces at room temperature.74 The authors chose to expose 200 L (langmuirs) of methanol on TiC(100) but only 5 L on TiC(111). The decision to use different exposures probably stemmed from a lower sticking probability of methanol on TiC(100). UPS data following the adsorption of methanol on TiC(100) showed features that could be ascribed to the 2a, 7a, 6a + 1a, and 5a orbitals, which indicated the presence of molecularly adsorbed methanol. 186 The seemingly contradictory conclusions of methanol on CH3OH reported by Edamoto et al. and Franz et al. may have been caused by the differences in methanol exposure and in the adsorption temperature.74,183 In contrast, room-temperature adsorption on TiC(111) resulted in the appearance of two features at 5.5 (2e orbital) and 9.2 (1e + 5a1 orbitals) eV, which were attributed to the formation of the methoxy intermediate. 74,187 Edamoto and co-workers also considered the 5.5 eV feature to include emissions from atomic O, H, and C resulting from the complete decomposition of methanol.74 Studies of methanol adsorbed on ZrC(111)104 revealed nearly identical results to those on TiC(111).74 Room-temperature adsorption of methanol on ZrC(111) induced two UPS features at 6.0 and 10.0 eV, again indicative of the presence of methoxy.187 On the basis of work function calculations and by comparing with previous adsorption studies with O2, H2, and CO, Edamoto and co-workers suggested that the complete decomposition pathway dominated in the initial stages of methanol adsorption.104 Once the surface was covered with atomic C, H, and O species, however, the methoxy intermediate began to accumulate. As was the case on TiC(100),74 methanol adsorbed molecularly on ZrC(100) at room temperature.104,181 When the ZrC(100) surface was modified by oxygen to form a ZrO-like layer, however, methanol was observed to adsorb dissociatively, resulting in UPS features indicative of methoxy. These results were similar to those obtained for water on ZrC(100), where the dissociative adsorption of water on ZrC(100) was observed only after the formation of the ZrO-like layer.180,181 The observed activity of TiC(111) and ZrC(111), and the inactivity of TiC(100) and ZrC(100), contributed to a better understanding of the reactivity of groups 4 and 5 TMC surfaces toward oxygenated molecules. Combined with previous UPS results on NbC surfaces, 188 these investigations led to the conclusion that the (111) surfaces of groups 4 and 5 carbides were generally more active toward the dissociation of oxygenated molecules than the (100) plane. This conclusion was further supported by theoretical studies using the extended Hckel tight binding calculation to compare the active TiC(111) surface with the relatively inactive TiC(100) surface.20 The reaction mechanisms of methanol on C/Mo(110),182 C/W(110),110,112 and C/W(111) 110,189 have been investigated extensively due to the potential of utilizing Mo and W carbides as electrocatalysts in DMFCs. All three surfaces were found to be very active toward the dissociation of methanol, as indicated by the formation of the methoxy species at liquid nitrogen temperature. Combined TPD, AES, and HREELS studies revealed three potential decomposition pathways for methoxy: (1) complete decomposition to produce atomic C and O, and gas-phase hydrogen; (2) the scission of the CH bonds to produce CO and gas-phase hydrogen; and (3) the cleavage of the CO bond to produce atomic O and methane. The product selectivity of methanol is summarized in Table 6 for several clean and carbide-modified Mo(110), W(110), and W(111) surfaces. In brief, these values were derived by correlating the H2 desorption peak from TPD experiments to the C and O signals from AES measurements. Detailed quantitative analysis of methanol decomposition on these surfaces can be found in the respective references. Table 6 also listed the reaction pathways of methanol on C/Ti(0001) and C/V(110), although the selectivity on these two surfaces could not be quantified due to the inward diffusion of C, O, and H.185 The comparison in Table 6 clearly indicates that the selectivity toward different reaction pathways of methanol varies noticeably on different carbide surfaces. Detailed descriptions for deriving the activity and selectivity values can be found in the respective references.

The presence of carbide reduced the overall decomposition activity from 0.411 to 0.280 CH3OH molecules reacting per W atom. In addition, the selectivity values toward CO and methane on C/W(111) increased to 31 and 14%, respectively. Because the carbide surfaces would most likely be partially oxidized under the fuel cell operating conditions, the effect of oxygen modification on C/W(111) was also investigated. A parallel study of the effect of oxygen modification indicated that the O/C/W(111) surface remained active toward the dissociation of methanol, although the decomposition activity was reduced to 0.236 molecules per W atom, and CO production became the dominant pathway.189 Comparative investigations of C/W(111) and C/W(110) showed only relatively minor differences in the reaction pathways of methanol.110,112,189 TPD measurements revealed that C/W(110) was similar to C/W(111) in terms of the overall decomposition activity. The different crystal planes showed slight variations in product selectivity, as compared in Table 6. For example, although both C/W(110) and C/W(111) surfaces showed 55% selectivity toward complete decomposition, the C/W(110) surface yielded similar amounts of CO (20%) and CH4 (22%), while the C/W(111) surface produced more CO (31%) than CH4 (14%).
The C/Mo(110) surface showed significant differences in terms of the product selectivity.182 As shown in Table 6, the reaction pathway leading to the formation of methane, an undesirable reaction in the electrooxidation of methanol, was inhibited on the C/Mo(110) surface. The absence of methane production on C/Mo(110) could also explain the promotion effect reported by Kudo et al., who incorporated molybdenum carbides into tungsten carbides as a promoter in DMFC studies.9-11 The reaction of methanol was also conducted to explore the possible synergistic effect of depositing submonolayer Pt onto the C/W(111) surface.81 While the presence of submonolayer Pt decreased the overall decomposition activity from 0.280 to 0.177 methanol molecules per W atom, the Pt-modified C/W(111) surface no longer produced gas-phase methane. The synergistic effect is demonstrated in Figure 6, which compares the HREEL spectra following the adsorption and decomposition of methanol on C/W(111) and on Pt/C/W(111) with a Pt coverage equivalent to 0.6 ML (monolayer). On C/W(111), the HREEL spectrum at 90 K was characteristic of the methoxy (CH3O) intermediate, indicating that the C/W(111) surface was very reactive toward the dissociation of the OH moiety in methanol even at liquid nitrogen temperature. The HREEL spectra at higher temperatures indicated that the methoxy intermediate was stable up to 330 K, with the minor changes in the relative intensities being related to changes in the orientation of adsorbed methoxy.189 Figure 6 Comparison of HREEL spectra monitoring the thermal decomposition of CH3OH on (a) C/W(111)189 and (b) Pt/C/W(111).81 The surfaces were exposed to submonolayer coverage of methanol at 100 K followed by heating to the indicated temperatures.
By comparing the corresponding HREEL spectra on Pt-modified C/W(111),81 it was clear that the decomposition pathway of methanol was significantly altered when the C/W(111) surface was modified by 0.6 ML (monolayer) of Pt: (1) The 0.6 ML Pt/C/W(111) surface was somewhat less active than C/W(111) toward the scission of the OH bond, as indicated by the presence of a relatively weak ν(OH) mode of molecular methanol on Pt/C/W(111) at 90 K. (2) On the other hand, the presence of the 0.6 ML Pt enhanced the subsequent decomposition of methoxy, as indicated by the significant decrease in the intensities of the methoxy vibrational modes on 0.6 ML Pt/C/W(111) between 230 and 330 K. In other words, the C/W(111) was more active than Pt toward the initial dissociation of the OH bond of methanol, while Pt was more active than C/W(111) toward the subsequent dissociation of the CH bonds in methoxy. As a result, the Pt/C/W(111) surface was more active than either Pt 190,191 or C/W(111)189 toward the complete decomposition of methanol at temperatures below 330 K, clearly indicating a synergistic effect by supporting submonolayer coverages of Pt on C/W(111).81 The decomposition of methanol on a WC film, prepared by PVD synthesis on a glassy carbon substrate, was recently studied using TPD and HREELS.17 The fundamental surface science study on PVD films demonstrated one of the first examples in bridging the materials gap between single crystal surfaces and polycrystalline films. Due to the fact that PVD films were not as well ordered as single crystal surfaces, HREELS measurements on PVD films were largely unexplored. By using a model LK3000 HREELS spectrometer (typical spectral resolution of 30 cm-1 at an intensity of 106 counts/second on single crystal surfaces), Zellner et al. were able to obtain relatively high quality HREELS data from the reaction of methanol on WC films, as shown in Figure 7. The HREEL spectra were characterized by excellent spectral resolution and adequate signal-to-noise. The vibrational spectra at 200 K on both WC and Pt/WC surfaces correspond to the methoxy (CH3O) intermediate, indicating that both surfaces were very reactive toward the dissociation of the OH bond in methanol. More interestingly, the presence of Pt on WC enhances the subsequent dissociation of methoxy on the Pt/WC surface between 400 and 500 K, as demonstrated by the decrease in the intensity of the methoxy vibrational modes on Pt/WC. Therefore, similar to those observed on the Pt/WC/W(111) single-crystal surface (Figure 6), the results in Figure 7 confirmed the promoting effect by depositing Pt on the WC film.17 Figure 7 HREEL spectra monitoring the thermal decomposition of CH3OH on PVD films17 of (a) WC and (b) 0.8 ML Pt/WC. The Pt/WC surface was prepared by evaporating Pt onto a clean PVD WC film at 600 K.
The reactions of other alcohol molecules, such as ethanol and 2-propanol, were studies on TiC(100) and VC(100) using TPD and HREELS.193 Both surfaces showed some dissociative activity toward ethanol and 2-propanol upon adsorption at 100 K, although the TiC(100) surface appeared to be slightly more active at this temperature. By 153 K, alkoxy intermediates from ethanol decomposition were detected with HREELS on both TiC(100) and VC(100). When heated to higher temperatures, the dehydration of the alkoxy intermediates produced gas-phase alkenes as the dominant reaction products. Although it was less active at 100 K, the VC(100) surface was estimated to be 20% more active toward the production of alkenes than TiC(100). This observation was similar to the comparative investigation of the dissociation of methanol on the two surfaces by the same authors, as described earlier.183 Moreover, isotopic studies revealed that γ-hydride elimination was a critical step in the formation of gas-phase alkene from adsorbed ethanol.193 Additional AFM studies of ethanol adsorbed on VC(100) showed approximately 40% reduction in the frictional forces when compared to the case of the unmodified VC(100) surface.194 Related frictional response studies were also conducted on VC(100) after the adsorption of 1-octanol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol.195 Perry and co-workers noted that, upon adsorption of 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at room temperature, the surface exhibited both an increase in friction and a decrease in adhesion. The higher frictional response was attributed to the shear strength of the multilayer adsorbate film. On the other hand, the reduced adhesion could be due to the increase in surface roughness and a lowering of surface free energy.195 These authors also utilized similar approaches to investigate the interaction of a model lubricant additive, trimethyl phosphate, on the TiC(100) and VC(100) surfaces.196
5.3. Carbon Dioxide
The interaction between CO2 and Mo2C/Mo(100) was investigated using HREELS, TPD, and XPS.197 The adsorption of CO2 onto Mo2C/Mo(100) did not result in any changes in the surface work function. Vibrational studies exhibited features at 660 and 2355 cm-1, which were characteristic vibrations of unperturbed CO2. Additional TPD measurements showed only a single desorption peak at 190 K. In contrast, when the Mo2C/Mo(100) surface was covered by potassium, Solymosi and co-workers observed a decrease in the work function by as much as 3.3 eV. Furthermore, HREELS results showed losses at 750, 1220, and 1600 cm-1, which were ascribed to the formation of the CO2- radical.197 These results generally agreed with previous investigations of the adsorption of CO2 on K-covered Pt-group metal surfaces. 198-200
6. Reactions with Sulfur-Containing Molecules
The removal of sulfur from the hydrocarbon feeds via hydrodesulfurization (HDS) is critical in preserving the catalyst activities in refinery processes.204 Typically sulfur is found in the form of thiols, sulfides, and thiophenes,205 which are usually abated with a mixture of cobalt and molybdenum sulfide catalysts supported on γ-alumina.204,206,207 Recent reactor studies have demonstrated that supported molybdenum carbides possess HDS activity over twice that of a commercial Ni-promoted MoSx catalyst.208 Reactivity studies of model catalyst surfaces using simple probe molecules have provided valuable insights into industrial processes. For example, thiophene 209-211 and SO2 212,213 are molecules often used to model HDS and De-SOx processes, respectively.
6.1. Thiophene
The chemistry of thiophene (C4H4S) has been studied over a C/Mo(110) surface by Rodriguez et al. using synchrotron-based soft-XPS.211 Exposures of thiophene at 100 K produced S 2p features characteristic of physisorbed and chemisorbed thiophene between 166.5 and 164.5 eV; the decomposition of thiophene had not taken place at this temperature, as evidenced by the absence of atomic S features at 163.5 and 161.5 eV. Heating to 170 K resulted in the desorption of physisorbed C4H4S. The decomposition of thiophene occurred between 200 and 250 K, producing atomic S and CxHy fragments on the surface. The CxHy fragments further decomposed at higher temperatures, with the carbon eventually migrated into the bulk. The strongly bonded atomic sulfur could only be removed after heating the surface to above 2200 K.211 Overall, the reactivity of the C/Mo(110) surface toward C4H4S was similar to that of clean Mo(110). 214 The decomposition of thiophene on an α-Mo2C(0001) single-crystal surface was investigated by St. Clair et al. using TPD measurements.210 The desorption of the hydrogen product was detected at 435 and 600 K, with the first peak being desorption-limited and the second being reaction-limited. These authors attributed the first H2 signal to the decomposition of thiophene and the second to the subsequent dehydrogenation of surface CxHy fragments. The decomposition of thiophene was confirmed by additional XPS and UPS studies, which indicated that the scission of CS bonds occurred at a temperature of 170 K or lower.210
6.2. Alkanethiol
The reactions of H2S and CH3SH on C/Mo(110) have been investigated to further understand the interaction between sulfur-containing molecules and carbide surfaces..212 Using SXPS, Rodriguez and co-workers showed that C/Mo(110) is active toward the SH and SC bond scission at temperatures below 300 K. Upon H2S adsorption at 100 K, the S 2p spectrum indicated the presence of a physisorbed state and two chemisorbed species. Between 150 and 200 K, a significant portion of the chemisorbed H2S dissociated to atomic S and HS, and only atomic sulfur was present on the C/Mo(110) surface by 350 K. For comparison, the scission of the SH bond in the adsorbed CH3SH species most likely took place immediately upon adsorption at 100 K. Between 100 and 350 K, CH3S and CHyS intermediates coexisted on the carbide surface. Heating to 500 K resulted in further decomposition, which led to the desorption of methane, the incorporation of some carbon into the bulk, and the deposition of atomic S on the surface. Overall, the reactivities of the C/Mo(110) surface toward H2S and CH3SH were generally similar to those reported on clean Mo(110). 215 Rodriguez et al. suggested that the strong activity of the carbide surface toward sulfur-containing molecules can be attributed to the fact that metal centers in C/Mo(110) are in a low oxidation state and have a large density of 4d states near the Fermi level.212 The reactions of alkanethiols, specifically ethanethiol 216 and 1,2-ethanedithiol, 217,218 on C/Mo(110) have been studied by Roe and Schulz. While ethanethiols are not a prominent component in crude oil feeds, they were chosen as probe molecules to provide insights into the chemistry of sulfhydryl (SH) groups on carbide surfaces. Prior studies of ethanethiol on clean Mo(110) showed the formation of an ethanethiolate intermediate at 120 K. 219 The ethanethiolate intermediate on clean Mo(110) subsequently decomposes to yield gas-phase ethane and ethylene. A fraction of the surface intermediate also underwent complete decomposition to produce surface carbon and sulfur, and gas-phase hydrogen.216 Roe and Schulz also examined the effect of defects on the commonly studied (4 × 4)-C/Mo(110) surface. The authors characterized the surface as defective, as the LEED pattern showed certain missing spots from an ideal (4 × 4) overlayer. TPD measurements following low-temperature adsorption of ethanethiol on the defective (4 × 4)-C/Mo(110) surface revealed no major differences in terms of activity and selectivity when compared to those obtained on clean Mo(110). A broad ethylene desorption peak was observed between 200 and 400 K while ethane desorption was detected at 375 K. Roe and Schulz then examined the effect of sulfur coverage on the ethanethiol chemistry. As expected, the presence of surface sulfur reduced the amount of ethylene and ethane produced; the desorption temperatures of ethylene and ethane also shifted to higher temperatures with increasing sulfur coverage.216 The reaction of 1,2-ethanedithiol on the C/Mo(110) surface produced gas-phase ethylene and acetylene, and atomic sulfur.217,218 Unlike the chemistry of ethanethiol described above, significant differences were observed in the reaction pathways between clean Mo(110) and C/Mo(110) surfaces. In addition to the ethylene and acetylene products that were produced on clean Mo(110), the dissociation of 1,2-ethanedithiol on C/Mo(110) also led to the formation of gas-phase vinyl thiol and ethanethiol products. The authors suggested that while clean Mo(110) dissociated only a fraction of the CS bonds, the C/Mo(110) surface facilitated the complete desulfurization of ethanedithiol, leading to the desorption of non-sulfur-containing hydrocarbons.217
6.3. SO2
The dissociation pathway of SO2 on C/Mo(110) was investigated by Rodriguez and co-workers using SXPS.212 At 150 K the XPS S 2p spectrum showed the presence of atomic sulfur, SO2, and a mixture of SO3 and SO4. Between 200 and 500 K, the features attributed to SOx species decreased as the intensity for atomic sulfur increased. The atomic S and O resulting from the dissociation of SOx remained on the surface even after heating to 1200 K. Corresponding NEXAFS measurements following SO2 decomposition on Mo2C powders also showed similar reaction mechanisms to those on C/Mo(110).212 Rodriguez and co-workers also extended their SO2 studies to the TiC(001) surface. 220 Photoemission and TPD measurements revealed that most of the SO2 desorbed molecularly below room temperature, although a fraction (<35%) of the adsorbates underwent dissociation to produce surface S and O atoms at temperatures near 400 K. Parallel DFT calculations suggested that CS and CO interactions are essential for the dissociation of SO2 on the TiC(001) surface. 220,221 A related theoretical study also compared the reactivity of SO2 on three titanium carbides, metcar Ti8C12, nanocrystal Ti14C13, and bulk TiC(001).221 Using DFT-GGA calculations, the authors showed that Ti8C12 was the most reactive toward SO2 dissociation, followed by Ti14C13 and then the TiC(001) surface. Compared with other studies on metal oxides, 222,223 the various titanium carbide substrates were more efficient toward the dissociation of SO2. The results also clearly indicated that the carbon atoms in carbides directly influenced the desulfurization process by stabilizing the S and O adatoms.221
7. Reactions with Nitrogen-Containing Molecules
7.1. Ammonia
The interaction of ammonia with TiC(100) and VC(100) surfaces has been studied by Fernandez-Torres et al. using TPD, HREELS, and UPS. 224 On TiC(100), NH3 desorbed at 230 K at low coverages and at 211 K at near saturation coverage. The authors observed no evidence for the decomposition of NH3 up to 773 K, as the TPD measurements monitoring the H2 and N2 products showed no desorption features within this temperature range. At 153 K, the HREEL spectra of NH3 adsorbed on TiC(100) exhibited energy loss features at 1075, 1570, 3300, and 3400 cm-1, which were attributed to the symmetric NH3 bending, the asymmetric NH3 bending, νs(NH), and νas(NH) modes, respectively. The observation of an intense NH3 bending mode suggested that NH3 adsorbed with the C3 axis perpendicular to the surface. The authors also noted that ammonia most likely bonded to the metal sites on TiC(100), as indicated by the absence of surface CN vibrational modes and by the fact that the metal sites would accept electrons more readily than the carbon sites. Additional UPS experiments revealed two features at 6.4 and 10.6 eV, which corresponded to the 3a1 and 1e orbital emissions, respectively, of molecularly adsorbed NH3.
The adsorption of NH3 on VC(100) yielded essentially the same results as those on TiC(100).224 At saturation coverage, two monolayer desorption features were detected from VC(100) at 211 and 273 K, with the latter being attributed to NH3 adsorbed on defect sites. As was the case on TiC(100), no NH bond activation was observed on VC(100). These results were consistent with the modeling of electronic structures of the TiC(100) and VC(100) substrates, which suggested similar vacant electronic orbitals available to interact with the lone pair of NH3.34,224
7.2. Nitrile
The reactions of HCN 225,226 and acetonitrile (CH3CN) 227,228 provided insights into the activation of the nitrile functional group on carbides. Friend and co-workers used XPS, TPD, and HREELS to examine the surface reactions of HCN on clean and carbide-modified W(100).225,226 A variety of competing reaction pathways exist between 200 and 500 K: (1) molecular desorption of HCN, (2) formation of adsorbed HCNH, and (3) complete decomposition of HCN yielding gas-phase hydrogen, and surface carbon and nitrogen. Heating to temperatures above 600 K resulted in recombinatory desorption of HCN. By 1500 K, the original carbide surface was retained as atomic nitrogen recombined and desorbed as N2 from the surface.225,226 Parallel studies of acetonitrile showed that, aside from molecular desorption, a CH2CNH surface intermediate was formed following the selective formation of an NH bond and cleavage of a CH bond at 400 K.227,228 This surface species subsequently underwent three competing reaction pathways: (1) complete decomposition to atomic nitrogen, carbon, and gas-phase hydrogen; (2) isomerization back to acetonitrile, followed by desorption; and (3) scission of either NH or CH bonds to form HNC or HCN, carbon, and gas-phase hydrogen. Compared to the clean W(100) surface, the carbide surface was less selective toward the complete decomposition pathway. As a result, significant amounts of molecularly intact fragments were produced from the C/W(100) surface.227,228
8. Correlating Surface Reactivity with Electronic Properties
8.1. Similarities and Differences between TMC and Pt-Group Metal Surfaces
From the chemical reactivities summarized in sections 37, it is clear that the presence and/or incorporation of carbon atoms can significantly modify the chemical properties of groups 46 early transition metals. In most cases, the formation of carbides appears to tame the high chemical activity of the early transition metal surfaces. This is especially obvious in studies using hydrocarbon molecules as probe reactions (section 4). For example, groups 46 early transition metals bond strongly to ethylene in the di-σ configuration, which undergoes subsequent dissociation to atomic carbon and hydrogen without the cleavage of the metalcarbon bonds. In contrast, the formation of the ethylidyne (CCH3) intermediate on TMC surfaces indicates the rupture of one of the metalcarbon bonds in di-σ bonded ethylene, suggesting that the ethylene/surface complex is less strongly bonded on TMC than that on the corresponding clean metals. Another example is the reaction of cyclohexene. On groups 46 metals, di-σ bonded cyclohexene molecules undergo complete dissociation to atomic carbon and hydrogen without producing any gas-phase hydrocarbon products. In contrast, a significant fraction of di-σ bonded cyclohexene dehydrogenates to produce gas-phase benzene, again indicating weaker metaladsorbate bonds on the TMC surfaces. Therefore, the formation of carbides on groups 46 metals reduces the degree of interaction between adsorbates and TMC surfaces, leading to a modified surface activity that more closely resembles the Pt-group metals than the parent metals.
The description of Pt-like properties of TMC surfaces is, however, clearly an oversimplification. For example, in the case of the formation of ethylidyne from ethylene, the thermal stability and adsorption geometry of ethylidyne on TMC surfaces are noticeably different from those on Pt(111). In addition, in the case of the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to produce benzene, the desorption temperature and the desorption mechanism (reaction-limited vs desorption-limited) on TMCs are different from those on the Pt-group metal surfaces. Furthermore, in reactions involving oxygen-containing molecules (section 5), the TMC surfaces are significantly more active than the Pt-group metal surfaces.
The electronic properties of TMC and Pt-group metal surfaces, especially the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level, also appear to be different. For example, Figure 8 shows the SXPS spectra of Mo(110), C/Mo(110), and Pt(111).61 The comparison between Mo(110) and C/Mo(110) reveals a significant modification of the DOS of Mo(110) upon the formation of carbide. For the C/Mo(110) surface, the valence state is characterized by two overlapping peaks at 5.7 and 1.9 eV, which are related to emissions from the hybridized Mo and C states as assigned in previous studies.43,229,230 A new feature is also present on C/Mo(110) at approximately 12.5 eV below the Fermi level, which is due to contributions from the C 2s states.61 More importantly, the comparison between the SXPS spectra of C/Mo(110) and Pt(111) clearly shows differences between the two surfaces in terms of peak positions and relative intensities of features near the Fermi level. The interpretation of the SXPS results requires the assistance of theoretical modeling, as described below.
Figure 8 SXPS comparing the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi level of Mo(110), C/Mo(110), and Pt(111).61 The incident photon energy was 150 eV for the Mo valence states.
8.2. Theoretical Modeling of Surface Properties
As mentioned in sections 27 and summarized in Tables 1 and 2, theoretical investigations, in particular DFT modeling, have been the subject of many investigations to correlate the electronic and chemical properties of TMC surfaces. For example, the theoretical investigations have revealed different electronic properties between TiC(100) and TiC(111)20,22,34 and between TiC(100) and VC(100),34 which have in turn been utilized to successfully explain the different chemical activities between these surfaces.
DFT modeling has also played an important role in understanding the effect of carbon/metal stoichiometry on the electronic, structural, and chemical properties in TMCs. For example, Didziulis et al. have recently compared the electronic properties of Ti8C8, Ti9C9, Ti13C13, and V9C9 clusters to further highlight the different electronic properties between Ti and V carbides.34 Rodriguez and co-workers have provided significant insights by systematically comparing the properties of metcar Ti8C12, nanocrystal Ti14C13, and bulk TiC(001).39,221,231 These authors have recently performed additional DFT modeling on the electronic and chemical properties of another metcar compound, Mo8C12, to determine the effect of carbon in group 6 metal carbides.40,232,233 The utilization of the metcar nanostructures as model systems will continue to be an area of interest in the DFT modeling of TMC. 234-237 Several recent studies have attempted to correlate the center of the metal d-band to the chemical activities of TMC surfaces.61,238,239 For example, Rodriguez and co-workers have recently correlated the shift in the d-band center from Mo(001) to γ-MoC(001) with the adsorption energy of CO and atomic sulfur.238 These studies have been inspired by the work of Nrskov and co-workers, who have demonstrated a strong correlation between the center of the d-band and the surface reactivity of transition metals and alloys. 240,241 More recently, such a correlation has been extended to bimetallic surfaces with the monolayer film of the second metal residing either on the surface or in the subsurface region. 242,243 One of the advantages of utilizing the d-band center as a parameter for the electronic properties of TMCs is that it can be measured experimentally, such as using SXPS. The direct comparison of the DFT modeling results with experimental measurements provides a critical validation of the modeling work. For example, Figure 9 compares the occupied states derived from DFT modeling with the SXPS measurement for C/Mo(110).239 The DFT result is obtained using a C-terminated Mo2C(0001) surface as shown earlier in Figure 1d. Because the estimation of the d-band center involves the overall average of both the occupied and unoccupied states, SXPS alone cannot provide a direct comparison with the theoretically predicted d-band center. Techniques such as ARPES or inverse photoemission spectroscopy will be needed to determine the density of the unoccupied states. Nevertheless, the comparison between DFT modeling and SXPS measurements, as shown in Figure 9, provides a validity test of the occupied states between theoretical and experimental results.
Figure 9 Comparing the SXPS spectrum of C/Mo(110) with the DFT calculated spectrum of carbon-terminated Mo2C(0001).239 Details of the DFT modeling are described in the text.
Another obvious advantage of using the d-band center model is that it allows a direct comparison of the electronic and chemical properties of TMC surfaces with those of Pt-group metals and alloys. For example, Figure 10 shows the correlation between the calculated hydrogen binding energy (HBE) and the d-band center for several bimetallic alloys and metal carbides. For comparison, the values for the corresponding monometallic components are also included. Figure 10 shows that the HBE decreases nearly linearly as the d-band center shifts away from the Fermi level on monometallic and bimetallic transition metal surfaces.240-243 The general trend in the DFT results in Figure 10 has been verified experimentally on several bimetallic surfaces by TPD studies of the desorption of hydrogen. 244-246 Furthermore, it is well established that the general trend shown in Figure 10 can be extended to the adsorption strength of many other inorganic and organic molecules on monometallic and bimetallic surfaces.240,241 Therefore, establishing a correlation between the HBE and the d-band center of TMC surfaces would significantly enhance the understanding and predictability of the chemical properties of TMC surfaces. The values for the groups 4 and 5 TMC surfaces in Figure 10 are calculated using the metal-terminated fcc(111) surfaces; the values for the group 6 Mo2C are obtained using both C- and Mo-terminated surfaces.61,239 The general trend in Figure 10 is that the d-band center of a TMC shifts away from the Fermi level as compared to the case of the corresponding parent metal surface, which is consistent with the experimental observation that the TMC surface is less active than the parent metal. Calculations on other TMC surfaces, such as the fcc(100) and C-terminated fcc(111) surfaces, are necessary to establish whether a near linear correlation exists for the TMC surfaces.
Figure 10 Correlation of HBE with the d-band centers of TMC and bimetallic surfaces.61,239,242,243 The d-band centers were determined using a short cutoff radius of 1 Å for all surfaces.
While the results in Figure 10 suggest that the d-band center shifts away from the Fermi level as compared to the case of the corresponding parent metals, it is important to point out this shift in carbides is more complicated than that in bimetallic surfaces. This is because the formation of the metalcarbon bonds often leads to a charge transfer from metal to carbon. The resulting decrease in the d-band filling would most likely shift the d-band center toward, instead of away from, the Fermi level. Rodriguez and co-workers have suggested the possible origin for the shift of the d-band center in carbides.238 They pointed out that the strong interaction with carbon should broaden the d-bandwidth of the parent metal and therefore shift the d-band center away from the Fermi level. More systematic DFT modeling is clearly necessary to achieve a general correlation of the d-band centers in various carbide surfaces.
Although the d-band center model offers the potential to correlate the electronic and chemical properties of TMC surfaces, it is important to point out that little is understood in this area at present. The presence of carbon in TMC can induce both electronic and structural modifications, at least in the following three effects: (1) The electronic interaction between the valence states of carbon and the parent metal modifies the density of states near the Fermi level. (2) The incorporation of carbon typically increases the metalmetal distance as compared to that of the parent metal, which causes a tensile strain in the metal lattice and should lead to additional modification of the metal d-band. 247 (3) The presence of carbon atoms in or on the surface reduces the number of surface metal sites available for the adsorption and subsequent reactions of molecules. All three effects should lead to modifications of the surface reactivity of TMCs compared to their parent metal surfaces. Additional theoretical and experimental studies are needed to decouple these different effects.
9. Future Research Opportunities
As summarized in the current review, surface science studies have significantly enhanced the fundamental understanding of the intriguing chemical properties of TMC surfaces. The combined experimental and theoretical investigations have led to some correlations, although mostly qualitative at present, between the electronic properties and surface reactivities. The authors firmly believe that TMC surfaces will provide fruitful and challenging opportunities for future surface science studies, in particular in the following three areas:(1) As model systems to determine quantitative correlations between the electronic and chemical properties. As pointed out in the previous section, the formation of carbides on groups 46 metals can modify the electronic and structural properties of the parent metals, both of which can lead to modified chemical activities. More concerted experimental studies and theoretical modeling are needed to decouple these effects. Furthermore, these studies should also lead to a deeper understanding of the roles of the metal d-band, such as the d-band center, in controlling the adsorption/reaction of molecules on TMC surfaces. The results from these studies should enhance our understanding of the fundamental correlation between electronic and chemical properties not only for TMC surfaces but also for transition metals in general.
(2) As examples to bridge the materials gap between single-crystal surfaces and real world catalytic materials. Previous studies have demonstrated that stoichiometric PVD films17 and metcar nanoclusters236 can be synthesized relatively easily and can be utilized as model systems for polycrystalline TMC surfaces and supported TMC particles, respectively. The structural, electronic, and chemical properties of the PVD films and metcar clusters can be readily investigated using a battery of experimental and theoretical surface science techniques. The fundamental understanding from these studies should provide a critical link between single-crystal surfaces and TMC catalysts.
(3) As model surfaces to determine the feasibility of TMCs as potential catalysts and electrocatalysts. In addition to the Pt-like properties, TMC materials are attractive catalysts because of their tolerance to sulfur poisoning 248,249 and resistance to coke formation. 250,251 Recent studies using TMCs as catalysts for steam reforming249,250 and as electrocatalysts for fuel cells17 have further renewed these interests. Surface science studies of carefully chosen probe molecules will identify whether TMC surfaces possess desirable reaction pathways over those on unmodified transition metals. In addition, surface science investigations of the chemical stability of TMCs, especially under in-situ conditions, will provide important insights into the feasibility and experimental conditions for using TMCs as catalysts and electrocatalysts. Finally, further studies of the synergistic effect by depositing submonolayer Pt-group metals on TMC surfaces81,162 will identify the possibility of using TMCs as catalyst supports for catalytic and electrocatalytic applications.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
