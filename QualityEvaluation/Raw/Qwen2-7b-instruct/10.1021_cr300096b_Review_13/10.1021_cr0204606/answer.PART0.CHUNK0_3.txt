[1] "The adsorption of hydrogen and deuterium has been investigated on the (111) surfaces of several groups 4 and 5 single-crystal carbides, TiC(111), ZrC(111), HfC(111), NbC(111), and TaC(111)."
[2] "The presence of preadsorbed oxygen on the carbide surfaces also resulted in a significant reduction of the CO desorption temperature."
[3] "The difference in the surface reactivity toward CO was attributed to the participation of the electronic states around EF on ZrC(111) and oxidized ZrC(100); however, these surface states were not present on unmodified ZrC(100), leading to the weaker interaction of CO on ZrC(100)."
[4] "The detection of ethylidyne suggests that the formation of carbide on early transition metals leads to the onset of the Pt-like properties."
[5] "The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions."

1. Hydrogen and deuterium have been studied on TiC(111), ZrC(111), HfC(111), NbC(111), and TaC(111).
2. Preadsorbed oxygen reduces the CO desorption temperature on carbide surfaces.
3. The difference in CO reactivity on ZrC(100) and ZrC(111) is due to electronic state participation around the Fermi level.
4. The presence of carbides leads to Pt-like properties, as seen with ethylidyne detection.
5. The stability of specific bimetallic structures correlates model surfaces with supported catalysts in hydrogenation.
