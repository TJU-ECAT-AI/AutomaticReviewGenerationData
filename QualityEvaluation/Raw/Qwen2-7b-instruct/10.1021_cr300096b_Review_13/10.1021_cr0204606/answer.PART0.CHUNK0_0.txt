The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms plays a crucial role in establishing a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation has significant implications for the design of more efficient catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.
