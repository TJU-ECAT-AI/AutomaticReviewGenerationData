[1] "The thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures, especially those containing subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d systems, plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of supported catalysts."
[2] "This correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts has significant implications for the design of more efficient catalysts, as understanding the energetics and reactivity at the atomic level allows for the optimization of surface properties."
