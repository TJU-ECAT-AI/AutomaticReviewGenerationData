1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in creating a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation suggests that the surface chemistry and reactivity of model surfaces can closely replicate those of supported catalysts under comparable reaction conditions. Consequently, designing more efficient catalysts through first principles on model surfaces can pave the way for catalysts that exhibit enhanced activity, selectivity, and durability.

1. 特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的情况下，对氢化反应中模型表面和支撑催化剂之间的强烈相关性起着关键作用。这种相关性表明，模型表面的表面化学和反应性可以很好地模仿在相似反应条件下支持催化剂的表面化学和反应性。因此，通过第一原理在模型表面上设计更高效的催化剂可以为开发具有优化活性、选择性和稳定性的催化剂铺平道路。
