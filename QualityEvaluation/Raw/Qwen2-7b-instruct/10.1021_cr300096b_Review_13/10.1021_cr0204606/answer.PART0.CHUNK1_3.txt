[1] "From the chemical reactivities summarized in sections 37, it is clear that the presence and/or incorporation of carbon atoms can significantly modify the chemical properties of groups 46 early transition metals."
[2] "The presence of carbon in TMC can induce both electronic and structural modifications, at least in the following three effects: (1) The electronic interaction between the valence states of carbon and the parent metal modifies the density of states near the Fermi level. (2) The incorporation of carbon typically increases the metalmetal distance as compared to that of the parent metal, which causes a tensile strain in the metal lattice and should lead to additional modification of the metal d-band."
[3] "These authors firmly believe that TMC surfaces will provide fruitful and challenging opportunities for future surface science studies, in particular in the following three areas:(1) As model systems to determine quantitative correlations between the electronic and chemical properties."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The presence of carbon atoms modifies the electronic and structural properties of early transition metals, leading to a modified density of states near the Fermi level, increased metal-metal distances causing tensile strain, and additional modifications to the metal d-band. This correlation enables the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. The implications of this correlation for designing catalysts include improved understanding of the roles of the metal d-band in controlling adsorption/reaction of molecules on TMC surfaces, which can enhance the fundamental understanding of the correlation between electronic and chemical properties for not only TMC surfaces but also for transition metals in general.

在铂-3d系统中，特别是具有亚表面3d原子的双金属结构的热力学稳定性，显著促进了模型表面与支持催化剂之间氢化反应的强相关性。碳原子的存在修改了早期过渡金属的电子和结构性质，导致费米能级附近密度态的变化，金属-金属距离增加导致晶格应力，并进一步修改了金属d带。这种相关性使得利用模型表面的第一原理设计更有效的催化剂成为可能。这种相关性的含义对于设计催化剂包括增强对金属d带在控制分子在TMC表面吸附/反应中的作用的理解，这可以增强对电子和化学性质之间的相关性的基本理解，不仅适用于TMC表面，也适用于一般的过渡金属。
