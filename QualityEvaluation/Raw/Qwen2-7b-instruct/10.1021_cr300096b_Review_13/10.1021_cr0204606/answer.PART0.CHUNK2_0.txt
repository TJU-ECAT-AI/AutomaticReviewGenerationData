[1] "The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a critical role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This correlation allows for the design of more effective catalysts by understanding and predicting their behavior on model surfaces."

1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms contributes significantly to the strong link between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This enables the development of more efficient catalysts through insights gained from studying their behavior on model surfaces.
