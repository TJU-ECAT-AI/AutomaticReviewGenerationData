[1] "The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions is often attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms."
[2] "This correlation implies that by understanding the behavior of model surfaces, one can predict and design more effective catalysts using first principles."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation enables the prediction and design of more effective catalysts through the understanding of model surfaces.
