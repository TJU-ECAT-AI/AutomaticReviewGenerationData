The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows scientists to predict and understand the behavior of catalysts under various conditions, which is crucial for designing more effective catalysts. By studying these structures on model surfaces, researchers can gain insights into the mechanisms of hydrogenation reactions and optimize catalyst performance. This understanding can lead to the development of catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity, improving efficiency in industrial processes such as petroleum reforming.
