The Doraiswamy and Sharma volumes are well-produced and fairly priced advanced treatises on reaction engineering, specifically catering to practicing engineers and graduate students in the field. They provide a comprehensive account of multiphase reaction engineering, emphasizing the integration of mass and heat transport with chemical reactions. However, the authors acknowledge that their success in unifying the subject is somewhat limited due to the scarcity of experimental results for in-depth, quantitative analysis of industrial processes. This lack of detailed industrial data hinders the consolidation of theoretical progress and guidance in reactor design. 

John H. Sinfelt's book offers a detailed and exciting account of research on bimetallic catalysts from the perspective of a leading pioneer in the field. It consolidates twenty years of research at Exxon's catalysis laboratories, making it easier for readers to understand the development of concepts and ideas related to bimetallic catalysts. The book covers selectivity aspects of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of metals from Group VIII and Ib in hydrocarbon reactions, and delves into the question of bimetallic cluster formation in systems containing immiscible metal components. Special emphasis is placed on the use of physical probes like EXAFS to obtain structural information on well-dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters. The final chapter focuses on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for petroleum reforming.

Doraiswamy和Sharma的两卷本是反应工程领域的高质量且定价合理的高级专著，特别适合工程师和研究生。它们提供了多相反应工程的全面介绍，强调了质量传输与化学反应之间的整合。然而，作者承认他们在此领域统一主题的成功有限，主要是由于工业过程定量分析所需的实验结果稀缺。缺乏详细工业数据阻碍了理论进展的整合和反应器设计的指导。

约翰·H·辛菲尔特的书从该领域领先先驱的角度提供了关于双金属催化剂研究的详细而令人兴奋的概述。它汇集了埃克森催化实验室过去二十年的研究成果，使读者更容易理解双金属催化剂概念和想法的发展。本书涵盖了组VIII和Ib中的金属在烃反应（如氢解、加氢、脱氢和异构化）中的双金属催化剂选择性方面，探讨了包含不互溶金属组件的系统中双金属簇形成的问题。特别强调使用物理探针如EXAFS来获取分散良好的支持钌铜和锇铜簇的结构信息。最后的一章专注于双金属催化剂在石油重整中的主要工业应用。
