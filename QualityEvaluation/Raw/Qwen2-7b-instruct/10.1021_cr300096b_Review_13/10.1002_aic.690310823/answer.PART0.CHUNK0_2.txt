[1] "The Doraiswamy and Sharma volumes are well produced and fairly priced."
[2] "The result is the most comprehensive account of this subject, a valuable source of important results, and a useful entry into the literature."
[3] "This work highlights the need for more detailed industrial data to allow consolidation of the theoretical progress and better guidance in reactor design."
[4] "Some of the newer topics engaging reaction engineers are introduced in the book (e.g., supported enzymes and metal complex catalysts), but the authors have not addressed molecular concepts; typical of books in reaction engineering, this one lacks a chemical orientation."
[5] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxon's catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[6] "The final chapter of the book concentrates on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for reforming of petroleum."

These books by Doraiswamy and Sharma provide a comprehensive overview of multiphase reaction engineering, highlighting the need for more detailed industrial data to support theoretical advancements and reactor design. They also introduce new topics like supported enzymes and metal complex catalysts, although they lack a strong chemical orientation. The book by Sinfelt focuses on bimetallic catalysts, discussing their applications in the petroleum industry and how they offer improved selectivity and activity maintenance compared to single-metal catalysts. It also explores the use of physical probes like EXAFS and Mossbauer spectroscopy in understanding bimetallic cluster catalysts and their industrial applications in reforming petroleum.
