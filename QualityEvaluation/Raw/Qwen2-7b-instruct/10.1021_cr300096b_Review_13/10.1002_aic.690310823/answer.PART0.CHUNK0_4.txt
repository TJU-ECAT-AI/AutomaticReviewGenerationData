[1] "John H. Sinfelt, the first in a series of Exxon Monographs, gives a detailed and exciting account of research on bimetallic catalysts."
[2] "They offer the potential of improved selectivity and better activity maintenance as compared to catalysts containing only one metal."
[3] "Although most of the work discussed in the book has already appeared in the open scientific literature, the book brings twenty years of research at Exxons catalysis laboratories into context and makes it easier for the reader to appreciate the development of concepts and ideas concerning bimetallic catalysts."
[4] "Special emphasis is placed on a description of how physical probes such as EXAFS can successfully be used to obtain structural information on well dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters."
[5] "The final chapter of the book concentrates on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for reforming of petroleum."

Bimetallic catalysts, as detailed in John H. Sinfelt's book, have the potential to improve selectivity and maintain better activity compared to monometallic catalysts. They achieve this through enhanced structural properties that can be studied using techniques like EXAFS, which provides valuable insights into the arrangement of atoms within these catalysts. These insights are crucial for designing more effective catalysts. In industrial applications, such as petroleum reforming, bimetallic catalysts demonstrate significant benefits over single-metal catalysts.

双金属催化剂，在约翰·H·辛福特的书中详细阐述，与单一金属催化剂相比，它们在选择性和活性维持方面具有潜在的优势。它们通过增强的结构特性实现这一目标，这些特性可以通过EXAFS等技术研究，提供有关这些催化剂中原子排列的重要信息。这些见解对于设计更有效的催化剂至关重要。在石油重整等工业应用中，双金属催化剂显示出相对于单金属催化剂的显著优势。
