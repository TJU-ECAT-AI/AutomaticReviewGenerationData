The Doraiswamy and Sharma volumes are well-produced and fairly priced advanced treatises on reaction engineering, specifically catering to practicing engineers and graduate students in the field. They provide a comprehensive account of multiphase reaction engineering, emphasizing the integration of mass and heat transport with chemical reactions. However, the authors acknowledge that their success in unifying the subject is somewhat limited due to the scarcity of experimental results for in-depth, quantitative analysis of industrial processes. This lack of detailed industrial data hinders the consolidation of theoretical progress and guidance in reactor design. 

John H. Sinfelt's book offers a detailed and exciting account of research on bimetallic catalysts from the perspective of a leading pioneer in the field. It consolidates twenty years of research at Exxon's catalysis laboratories, making it easier for readers to understand the development of concepts and ideas related to bimetallic catalysts. The book covers selectivity aspects of bimetallic catalysts, particularly those composed of metals from Group VIII and Ib in hydrocarbon reactions, and delves into the question of bimetallic cluster formation in systems containing immiscible metal components. Special emphasis is placed on the use of physical probes like EXAFS to obtain structural information on well-dispersed, supported ruthenium-copper and osmium-copper clusters. The final chapter focuses on the major industrial application of bimetallic catalysts for petroleum reforming.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This is because the stability allows for the formation of well-dispersed clusters with optimized geometric arrangements that enhance reactivity and selectivity. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces lie in the ability to predict and tailor catalyst performance based on theoretical models that mimic real-world conditions. By understanding the underlying mechanisms that govern the stability and reactivity of bimetallic structures, researchers can design catalysts with enhanced properties, leading to improved efficiency and selectivity in industrial processes, such as the reforming of petroleum. These insights not only advance the field of catalysis but also demonstrate the power of integrating physical characterization techniques with theoretical approaches to solve complex problems in chemical engineering and materials science.
