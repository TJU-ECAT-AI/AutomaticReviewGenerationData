[1] "Despite the promise of fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers as clean alternative energy sources, the high loadings of precious metal electrocatalysts drive up the cost of these devices and affect their competitiveness with conventional power sources."
[2] "Precious metals, notably Pt, are necessary for the operation of fuel cells and photoelectrochemical cells because they facilitate the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes. However, Pt is expensive and scarce."
[3] "One strategy to lower Pt loadings is to use tungsten monocarbide (WC) as a bulk replacement to support one monolayer (ML) of Pt in a coreshell structure."
[4] "Despite an ideal single ML of Pt not being produced on the WC powder using ALD, the presence of a thin Pt layer on the WC substrate is sufficient to bring about activities that are comparable to conventional Pt catalysts."
[5] "WC was shown here to be a good core material for Pt for this particular electrochemical reaction."
[6] "While improvements to the synthesis of these catalysts can be made in making even thinner Pt films and using smaller WC particles, the positive results observed here are a significant step towards more efficiently utilizing precious metals in powder catalysts in electrochemical devices."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that the behavior of supported catalysts can be effectively modeled using first principles on model surfaces, which aids in the design of more effective catalysts. The implications of this correlation are profound, allowing researchers to predict and optimize the performance of catalysts based on theoretical calculations rather than experimental trials alone.

特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，尤其是在Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的情况下，对氢化反应中的模型表面和支撑催化剂之间的强相关性做出了重大贡献。这种相关性表明，支撑催化剂的行为可以通过基于模型表面的第一原理计算进行有效模拟，这有助于设计更有效的催化剂。这种相关性的含义深远，允许研究人员根据理论计算而非实验试错来预测和优化催化剂性能。
