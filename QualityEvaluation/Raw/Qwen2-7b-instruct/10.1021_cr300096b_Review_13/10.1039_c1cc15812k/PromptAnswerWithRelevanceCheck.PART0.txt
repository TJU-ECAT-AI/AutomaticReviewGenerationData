[1] "Despite the promise of fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers as clean alternative energy sources, the high loadings of precious metal electrocatalysts drive up the cost of these devices and affect their competitiveness with conventional power sources."
[2] "Precious metals, notably Pt, are necessary for the operation of fuel cells and photoelectrochemical cells because they facilitate the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes. However, Pt is expensive and scarce."
[3] "One strategy to lower Pt loadings is to use tungsten monocarbide (WC) as a bulk replacement to support one monolayer (ML) of Pt in a coreshell structure."
[4] "Despite an ideal single ML of Pt not being produced on the WC powder using ALD, the presence of a thin Pt layer on the WC substrate is sufficient to bring about activities that are comparable to conventional Pt catalysts."
[5] "WC was shown here to be a good core material for Pt for this particular electrochemical reaction."
[6] "While improvements to the synthesis of these catalysts can be made in making even thinner Pt films and using smaller WC particles, the positive results observed here are a significant step towards more efficiently utilizing precious metals in powder catalysts in electrochemical devices."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that the behavior of supported catalysts can be effectively modeled using first principles on model surfaces, which aids in the design of more effective catalysts. The implications of this correlation are profound, allowing researchers to predict and optimize the performance of catalysts based on theoretical calculations rather than experimental trials alone.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows for the prediction of catalyst performance based on model surface studies, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts. The implications of this correlation are that scientists can use theoretical models and calculations to guide the synthesis of catalysts with desired properties, potentially leading to the development of catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenation reactions. The literature demonstrates the application of this concept through the successful synthesis of PtWC coreshell catalysts using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and evaluation of their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. These results indicate that the ALD method can produce catalysts with lower platinum loadings that perform comparably to conventional bulk Pt catalysts, thus contributing to the efficient utilization of precious metals in electrochemical devices. The study highlights the potential for scaling up the ML PtWC thin film system to a more industrially relevant powder catalyst, which is a significant step towards more efficient catalyst design and manufacturing processes.

The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces include the ability to predict catalyst behavior, optimize catalyst composition, and tailor surface properties for specific applications. This approach can lead to the development of catalysts with improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced sustainability, contributing to advancements in clean energy technologies such as fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers. The successful synthesis and evaluation of PtWC coreshell catalysts using ALD demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology for producing catalysts with lower platinum loadings that maintain bulk-like performance, which is crucial for the economic viability of clean energy devices. The findings suggest that by leveraging the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, researchers can design catalysts that meet the performance requirements for various industrial applications while minimizing the use of precious metals, ultimately making clean energy solutions more competitive with conventional power sources.
