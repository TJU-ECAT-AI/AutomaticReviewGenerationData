1. Despite the potential benefits of fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers as sustainable energy solutions, the high use of precious metal electrocatalysts raises their costs and hinders their competitiveness with traditional power sources.
2. Synthesis techniques for producing PtWC core-shell particles have not been documented in existing literature.
3. The observed trends align with previous findings on thin film catalysts.
4. Though a single monolayer of Pt is not precisely achieved on the WC powder via ALD, the thin Pt layer on the WC substrate is enough to achieve comparable activity to conventional Pt catalysts.
5. Stability studies on Pt/WC in earlier research utilized a well-defined WC film with a single monolayer of Pt.

1. 尽管燃料电池、光电化学电池和电解器作为清洁能源的潜力巨大，但贵金属催化剂的高用量导致了这些设备的成本增加，并影响了它们与传统电源的竞争性。
2. 目前尚未见有关制备PtWC核壳粒子的合成方法的文献报道。
3. 观察到的趋势与先前对薄膜催化剂的研究结果一致。
4. 虽然在WC粉末上通过ALD无法精确获得单层Pt，但在WC基底上的薄Pt层足以达到与常规Pt催化剂相媲美的活性。
5. 早先的研究中，利用了具有单一单层Pt的完美定义的WC薄膜来研究Pt/WC的稳定性。
