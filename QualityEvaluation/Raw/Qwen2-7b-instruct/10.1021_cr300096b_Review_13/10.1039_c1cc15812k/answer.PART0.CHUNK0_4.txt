<p>Despite the promise of fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers as clean alternative energy sources, the high loadings of precious metal electrocatalysts drive up the cost of these devices and affect their competitiveness with conventional power sources.</p>
<p>One strategy to lower Pt loadings is to use tungsten monocarbide (WC) as a bulk replacement to support one monolayer (ML) of Pt in a coreshell structure.</p>
<p>For electrochemical applications, the similarities between WC and Pt often deviate at the surface, making it difficult to use WC as a direct replacement for Pt.</p>
<p>Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was determined to be one possibility because it can produce ultra-thin films with nanometre-level control on a number of substrates.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 Tafel plots of WC powder; 5, 10, and 30 ALD PtWC catalysts; and 10 wt% Pt supported on high surface area carbon (Pt/C) are compared in the form of Tafel plots shown in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>The log of the exchange current densities were calculated from the Tafel parameters and are plotted against Pt ALD cycles shown in Fig. 3(a) and Pt surface area as determined by Cu stripping measurements shown in Fig. 3(b).</p>
<p>Table 1 Pt wt% loadings for each catalyst and total Pt mass on electrodes for each HER measurement Electrode Pt wt% Mass of Pt on electrode/mg 5 ALD cycles PtWC 0.20 0.00055 10 ALD cycles PtWC 0.49 0.0031 30 ALD cycles PtWC 0.85 0.0055 Pt/C 10 0.025</p>
<p>Although an ideal single ML of Pt is not produced on the WC powder using ALD, the presence of a thin Pt layer on the WC substrate is sufficient to bring about activities that are comparable to conventional Pt catalysts.</p>

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces can lead to practical catalysts with enhanced performance. By understanding the interactions and stability within these bimetallic structures, researchers can predict and optimize catalyst behavior for hydrogenation reactions. The implications of this correlation include the potential to develop catalysts with improved selectivity, efficiency, and stability, ultimately leading to more sustainable and economically viable hydrogen production processes.
