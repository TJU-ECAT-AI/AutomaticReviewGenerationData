<p>Despite the promise of fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers as clean alternative energy sources, the high loadings of precious metal electrocatalysts drive up the cost of these devices and affect their competitiveness with conventional power sources.</p>
<p>A reduction in its use is essential to ensure that these clean energy devices are economically viable.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is a need to develop electrocatalysts with lower Pt loadings that can perform as well as conventional bulk Pt catalysts.</p>
<p>Synthesis of ML PtWC powder catalysts is challenging, and to date no established methods exist.</p>
<p>Coreshell particles have been produced for other systems, but to our knowledge no synthesis method for producing PtWC coreshell particles has been reported.</p>
<p>The objectives of the current communication are (1) to utilize ALD to produce PtWC coreshell catalysts, and (2) to evaluate whether they show promising HER performance as predicted from ML PtWC thin films.</p>
<p>HER measurements for samples of WC powder; 5, 10, and 30 ALD cycles PtWC; and 10 wt% Pt supported on high surface area carbon (Pt/C) are compared in the form of Tafel plots shown in Fig. 2.</p>
<p>As few as 5 Pt ALD cycles on WC increases the HER activity considerably from unmodified WC, as seen in the upward shift in its Tafel plot.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after only 10 ALD cycles, the HER activity is nearly equivalent to the Pt/C catalyst, indicated by their nearly overlapping Tafel plots.</p>
<p>The 30 ALD cycle Tafel plot also falls on the Pt Tafel plot, showing that the low loading Pt reaches a limiting HER activity which is equivalent to that of Pt/C.</p>
<p>In terms of reducing the Pt loading while maintaining bulk-like performance, the PtWC coreshell powder catalysts produced HER results that are equivalent to the ML PtWC thin films reported previously.</p>
<p>While improvements to the synthesis of these catalysts can be made in making even thinner Pt films and using smaller WC particles, the positive results observed here are a significant step towards more efficiently utilizing precious metals in powder catalysts in electrochemical devices.</p>

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows for the prediction of catalyst performance based on model surface studies, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts. The implications of this correlation are that scientists can use theoretical models and calculations to guide the synthesis of catalysts with desired properties, potentially leading to the development of catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity for hydrogenation reactions. The literature demonstrates the application of this concept through the successful synthesis of PtWC coreshell catalysts using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and evaluation of their hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. These results indicate that the ALD method can produce catalysts with lower platinum loadings that perform comparably to conventional bulk Pt catalysts, thus contributing to the efficient utilization of precious metals in electrochemical devices. The study highlights the potential for scaling up the ML PtWC thin film system to a more industrially relevant powder catalyst, which is a significant step towards more efficient catalyst design and manufacturing processes.

The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces include the ability to predict catalyst behavior, optimize catalyst composition, and tailor surface properties for specific applications. This approach can lead to the development of catalysts with improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced sustainability, contributing to advancements in clean energy technologies such as fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers. The successful synthesis and evaluation of PtWC coreshell catalysts using ALD demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology for producing catalysts with lower platinum loadings that maintain bulk-like performance, which is crucial for the economic viability of clean energy devices. The findings suggest that by leveraging the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, researchers can design catalysts that meet the performance requirements for various industrial applications while minimizing the use of precious metals, ultimately making clean energy solutions more competitive with conventional power sources.
