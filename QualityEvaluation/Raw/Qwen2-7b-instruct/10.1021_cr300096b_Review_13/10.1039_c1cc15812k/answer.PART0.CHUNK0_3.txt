Despite the promise of fuel cells, photoelectrochemical cells, and electrolyzers as clean alternative energy sources, the high loadings of precious metal electrocatalysts drive up the cost of these devices and affect their competitiveness with conventional power sources. Precious metals, notably Pt, are necessary for the operation of fuel cells and photoelectrochemical cells because they facilitate the electrochemical reactions at the electrodes. However, Pt is expensive and scarce. A reduction in its use is essential to ensure that these clean energy devices are economically viable. Therefore, there is a need to develop electrocatalysts with lower Pt loadings that can perform as well as conventional bulk Pt catalysts.

Answer: The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows for the prediction and understanding of catalytic behavior based on model surface studies, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts. The implications of this correlation include the ability to optimize catalyst composition and structure for enhanced performance, leading to more efficient hydrogenation processes and potentially lower costs in industrial applications.
