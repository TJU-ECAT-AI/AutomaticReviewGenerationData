[1] "WC is an excellent candidate support material for ML Pt because it exhibits electronic properties that are similar to bulk Pt, leading to good adhesion between ML Pt and WC without drastically altering the catalytic properties of ML Pt."
[2] "The central hypothesis behind the effectiveness of ML Pt-WC catalysts is that the electronic properties of one ML Pt supported on WC are similar to those of bulk Pt, resulting in a stable structure with similar, though not identical, chemical and electrocatalytic properties."
[3] "The surface PDOS of WC(0001) is much closer to the Fermi level. Upon the addition of one ML Pt on WC, the surface PDOS of ML Pt/WC(0001) is shifted away from the Fermi level and becomes similar to that of Pt(111)."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by enabling a close resemblance in electronic properties. This similarity ensures good adhesion between the metal layer and the substrate, which is crucial for maintaining the catalytic activity of the supported catalysts. The implications of this correlation are significant for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. By understanding and mimicking the electronic structure and stability of these model surfaces, scientists can predict and optimize the performance of actual catalysts, leading to more efficient hydrogenation reactions.

In terms of designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures allows for a detailed examination of the electronic and chemical properties of the surface.
