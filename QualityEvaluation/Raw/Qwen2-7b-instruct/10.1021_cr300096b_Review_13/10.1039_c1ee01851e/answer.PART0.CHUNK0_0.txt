[1] "WC is an excellent candidate support material for ML Pt because it exhibits electronic properties that are similar to bulk Pt, leading to good adhesion between ML Pt and WC without drastically altering the catalytic properties of ML Pt."
[2] "By utilizing the lowest possible loading of Pt, one monolayer, on a low-cost material while maintaining the high catalytic activity of Pt, it is possible to reduce the Pt loading in various electrocatalytic applications by over an order of magnitude."
[3] "When the stability of WC is graphed as a function of potential and pH, WC exhibits three general regions of stability, corresponding to a stable surface, a partially oxidized surface, and an unstable surface."
[4] "The case study of ML Pt-WC as methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst underscores the fact that ML Pt-WC catalysts displays similar, though not identical, properties to bulk Pt catalysts."
