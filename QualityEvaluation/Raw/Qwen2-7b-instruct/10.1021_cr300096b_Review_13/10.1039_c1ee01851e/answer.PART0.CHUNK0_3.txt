[1] "WC is an excellent candidate support material for ML Pt because it exhibits electronic properties that are similar to bulk Pt, leading to good adhesion between ML Pt and WC without drastically altering the catalytic properties of ML Pt."
[2] "By utilizing the lowest possible loading of Pt, one monolayer, on a low-cost material while maintaining the high catalytic activity of Pt, it is possible to reduce the Pt loading in various electrocatalytic applications by over an order of magnitude."
[3] "Although the boundaries of these regions are dependent on a variety of factors, an understanding of the corrosion behavior of WC is critical to the development of active and stable WC electrocatalysts."
[4] "When the stability of WC is graphed as a function of potential and pH, WC exhibits three general regions of stability, corresponding to a stable surface, a partially oxidized surface, and an unstable surface."
[5] "For the oxidation of methanol, ML Pt-WC appears to be a stable and active alternative to Pt, displaying promising activity due to its decreased affinity for CO compared to bulk Pt."

1.WC is an excellent choice for supporting ML Pt because it shares similar electronic properties with bulk Pt, ensuring strong adhesion and maintaining the high catalytic activity of Pt.
2.By using just one monolayer of Pt on a low-cost material like WC, the Pt loading in various electrocatalytic applications can be significantly reduced, potentially by over an order of magnitude.
3.Understanding the corrosion behavior of WC is essential for developing active and stable WC electrocatalysts, as its stability varies with potential and pH.
4.WC shows three regions of stability when its stability is analyzed in terms of potential and pH, encompassing a stable surface, a partially oxidized surface, and an unstable surface.
5.ML Pt-WC electrocatalysts are considered a stable and active alternative to Pt for the oxidation of methanol, thanks to their lower affinity for CO compared to bulk Pt.

1.WC是支持ML Pt的理想材料，因为它与纯Pt具有相似的电子特性，确保了ML Pt与WC之间的良好粘附并保持了Pt的高催化活性。
2通过在低成本材料WC上仅使用一层Pt，各种电催化剂中的Pt负载可以显著减少，可能减少一个数量级以上。
3理解WC的腐蚀行为对于开发活性和稳定的WC电催化剂至关重要，因为其稳定性取决于电压和pH值。
4当分析WC在电压和pH值下的稳定性时，WC表现出三个稳定区域，包括稳定的表面、部分氧化的表面和不稳定的表面。
5对于甲醇的氧化，ML Pt-WC电催化剂被视为比纯Pt更为稳定和活跃的选择，这归因于它们对CO的较低亲和力相比纯Pt。
