[1] "WC is an excellent candidate support material for ML Pt because it exhibits electronic properties that are similar to bulk Pt, leading to good adhesion between ML Pt and WC without drastically altering the catalytic properties of ML Pt."
[2] "The thermodynamic stability of WC when operated under the strongly oxidizing conditions of an ORR cathode appears to be a limiting factor for its application as PEMFC cathode."
[3] "By utilizing the lowest possible loading of Pt, one monolayer, on a low-cost material while maintaining the high catalytic activity of Pt, it is possible to reduce the Pt loading in various electrocatalytic applications by over an order of magnitude."
[4] "WC electrocatalysts are susceptible to electrochemical oxidation, an important first step in studying ML Pt-WC catalysts is to understand the stability of these thin films under operating conditions, in particular the pH and potential ranges corresponding to specific applications of interest."
[5] "The case study of ML Pt-WC as methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) catalyst underscores the fact that ML Pt-WC catalysts displays similar, though not identical, properties to bulk Pt catalysts."

1. The electronic properties of tungsten carbide (WC) closely match those of bulk platinum (Pt), enabling strong adhesion between one monolayer of Pt supported on WC while preserving the catalytic properties of the Pt layer. This makes WC an excellent candidate for supporting low-cost Pt catalysts.

2. The thermodynamic stability of WC under the highly oxidizing conditions of an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a significant limitation for its use as a PEM fuel cell cathode.

3. By employing a single layer of Pt on a cost-effective material, it is feasible to significantly decrease the amount of Pt used in electrocatalytic applications by more than an order of magnitude while maintaining high catalytic activity.

4. Understanding the stability of tungsten carbide (WC) under various pH and potential conditions is essential for developing active and stable WC-based electrocatalysts.

5. The performance of ML Pt-WC catalysts in methanol oxidation reactions mirrors that of bulk Pt catalysts, albeit with some differences, indicating that ML Pt-WC can be an effective alternative.

1. 钨碳化物(WC)的电子性质与纯铂(Pt)相似，能够提供良好的结合力，保持单层Pt层的催化性能。这使得WC成为支持低成本Pt催化剂的理想选择。

2. 在氧还原反应(ORR)的强氧化条件下，WC的热力学稳定性限制了其作为质子交换膜燃料电池阴极的应用。

3. 通过在低成本材料上使用单层Pt，可以大幅度减少各种电催化应用中的Pt含量（超过一个数量级），同时保持高催化活性。

4. 理解在不同pH和电位条件下钨碳化物(WC)的稳定性是开发活性和稳定的WC基电催化剂的关键。

5. ML Pt-WC催化剂在甲醇氧化反应中的表现与纯Pt催化剂类似，尽管存在一些差异，说明ML Pt-WC可以作为有效的替代品。
