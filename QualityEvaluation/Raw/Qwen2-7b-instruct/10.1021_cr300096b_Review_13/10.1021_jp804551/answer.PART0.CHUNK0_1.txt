The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This relationship holds significant implications for the development of more efficient catalysts through the application of first principles on model surfaces.
