          The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that by understanding and utilizing the principles derived from studying model surfaces, one can design more effective catalysts. The in situ time-resolved XRD and XAFS studies provide insights into the preparation of (Ga1xZnx)(N1xOx) photocatalysts through the reaction of NH3 with Ga2O3/ZnO and ZnGa2O4, highlighting the importance of these techniques in elucidating the properties and behavior of catalysts.
