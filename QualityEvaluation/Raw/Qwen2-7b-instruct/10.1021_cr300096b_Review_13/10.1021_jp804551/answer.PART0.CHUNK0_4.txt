The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, enhancing our ability to predict and optimize catalytic activity.
