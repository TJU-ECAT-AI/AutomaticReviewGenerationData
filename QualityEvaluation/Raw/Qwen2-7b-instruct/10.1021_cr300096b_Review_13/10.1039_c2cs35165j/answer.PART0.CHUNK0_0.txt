[1] "The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are with Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location."
[2] "The bimetallic systems have shown unique catalytic activities for hydrogenation of alkenes, aldehydes and conjugated molecules, reforming of oxygenate molecules to produce H2 and CO/CO2, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and ammonia to produce H2, and CO oxidation, among other catalytic reactions."
[3] "The subsurface configuration of the Ni/Pt(111) monolayer bimetallic system, PtNiPt(111), displays a unique low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on either Pt(111) or Ni(111)."
[4] "The reason for different selectivity on WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001) was explored by predicting the d-band partial density of states (PDOS). Furthermore, the d-band center of surface atoms had previously been shown to correlate with adsorbate binding energy."
[5] "The synergistic effect for methanolreforming on Pt/WC was explained in DFT calculations of reaction networks on Pt, WC and Pt/WC."
[6] "On the other hand, Au modification simply blocked the active sites of WC, leading to a diminished activity for methanol decomposition."
[7] "The volcano relationship between HER activity (io) and hydrogen binding energy (HBE) for several metal-modified carbide surfaces."

1. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces are influenced by the location of the admetal, which can lead to unique catalytic activities such as hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation.
2. The subsurface PtNiPt(111) structure in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts exhibits a distinctive low-temperature hydrogenation pathway absent in either Pt(111) or Ni(111) surfaces.
3. The selectivity differences between WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001) were analyzed using density functional theory calculations, revealing correlations between the d-band center and adsorbate binding energy.
4. DFT calculations explained the synergistic effect that makes the Pt/WC surface more selective for methanol reforming compared to Pt or WC alone.
5. Au modification on WC surfaces inhibited methanol decomposition, highlighting the importance of metal selection in controlling the catalytic activity of WC-based bimetallic catalysts.
6. The volcano relationship between hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and hydrogen binding energy on various metal-modified carbide surfaces suggests a predictive property-activity relationship for designing more effective HER catalysts.
