[1] "The reason for this enhanced reactivity was explored through modeling, electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[2] "The WGS rate decreased with increasing Pt loading, and the model that considered perimeter sites seemed to predict rates more accurately, suggesting that Pt/Mo2C was a bifunctional catalyst where both Pt and Mo2C participated in WGS."
[3] "It seems that Pt formed flat, raft-like particles on Mo2C instead of the cuboctahedral particles that formed on carbon supports."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by influencing the particle morphology and surface properties. As demonstrated in the literature, the enhanced reactivity of Pt/Mo2C catalysts for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is attributed to the formation of flat, raft-like Pt particles on the Mo2C surface instead of cuboctahedral particles on carbon supports. This morphology change is influenced by the stability of the Pt atoms in the subsurface configuration. The model that considered perimeter sites in predicting the WGS activity more accurately suggests that both Pt and Mo2C participate in the catalytic process, enhancing the overall reactivity. This correlation indicates that first principles calculations on model surfaces can provide insights into the design of more effective catalysts by predicting optimal particle shapes and surface compositions that lead to desired catalytic activities.

特定双金属结构的热动力学稳定性，特别是在Pt-3d系统中的亚表面3d原子中，通过影响颗粒形态和表面性质，促进了氢化反应中模型表面与支持催化剂之间的强相关性。文献中表明，Pt/Mo2C催化剂的水气转换（WGS）反应增强活性归因于在Mo2C表面上形成的平的筏状Pt颗粒，而不是在碳支撑上形成的立方八面体颗粒。这种形态变化受到稳定在亚表面配置的Pt原子的影响。考虑到边缘位置的模型更准确地预测了活性，这表明Pt和Mo2C都在催化过程中起作用，增强了整体活性。这种相关性表明，基于模型表面的第一原理计算可以为设计更有效的催化剂提供见解，通过预测最佳颗粒形状和表面组成以实现所需的催化活性。
