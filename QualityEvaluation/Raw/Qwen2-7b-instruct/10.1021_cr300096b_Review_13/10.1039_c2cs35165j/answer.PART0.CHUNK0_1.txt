[1] "Bimetallic surfaces comprised of a host metal and an admetal have been shown to display unique electronic and chemical properties as compared to their parent metals."
[2] "The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are with Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals."
[3] "The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location."
[4] "Supporting admetals on TiC often leads to the formation of small, flat metal particles that promote hydrogenation and oxidation reactions through synergistic interactions of adsorbates with both admetal particles and TiC."
[5] "More detailed efforts need to be devoted to understand the long term stability of metal-modified carbides for both catalytic and electrocatalytic applications."

1. The unique electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces, when compared to their parent metals, are a result of the hetero-atom bonding and strain effect caused by the interaction between the host metal and the admetal. 

2. Among the most studied bimetallic systems are those comprising platinum (Pt) as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals.

3. The positioning of the admetal on the bimetallic surface influences the electronic and catalytic characteristics of the 3d/Pt system.

4. Depositing admetals on titanium carbide (TiC) often results in the creation of tiny, flat metal particles that facilitate hydrogenation and oxidation processes through the synergistic interaction between the adsorbates and both the metal particles and the TiC.

5. To enhance the long-term stability of metal-modified carbides in both catalytic and electrocatalytic applications, more extensive research efforts are required.

1. 与基体金属相比，由主体金属和辅助金属组成的双金属表面显示出独特的电子和化学性质，这是由于异原子键合和通过主体金属和辅助金属之间的相互作用引起的应力效应。

2. 其中研究最多的双金属系统是铂（Pt）作为主体金属和3d过渡金属作为辅助金属的系统。

3. 辅助金属在双金属表面的位置影响了3d/Pt系统的电子和催化特性。

4. 在钛碳化物（TiC）上沉积辅助金属通常会导致形成微小的、平坦的金属颗粒，这些颗粒通过吸附剂与金属颗粒和TiC之间的协同作用促进氢化和氧化过程。

5. 为了增强金属改性碳化物在催化和电催化应用中的长期稳定性，需要进行更多的研究工作。
