[1] "The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are with Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location."
[2] "The d-band center correlates well with adsorbate binding energy and thus catalytic and electrocatalytic activity."
[3] "The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors."
[4] "Extensive research efforts have focused on reducing the amount of Pt in catalysts or replacing Pt altogether."
[5] "The bimetallic systems have shown unique catalytic activities for hydrogenation of alkenes, aldehydes and conjugated molecules, reforming of oxygenate molecules to produce H2 and CO/CO2, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and ammonia to produce H2, and CO oxidation, among other catalytic reactions."
[6] "However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions."
[7] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures."
[8] "The presence of Pt on WC resulted in a synergistic effect that made the Pt/WC surface more selective toward methanolreforming than either Pt or WC alone."
[9] "On the other hand, Au modification simply blocked the active sites of WC, leading to a diminished activity for methanol decomposition."
[10] "A problem specific to ORR electrocatalysts in DMFC is methanol crossover through the PEM. The cathode is able to oxidize methanol, and this contributes a parasitic oxidation current and blocks catalyst active sites."

1. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the location of the admetal. The d-band center correlates well with adsorbate binding energy, affecting catalytic and electrocatalytic activity. These systems have shown unique catalytic activities across various chemical transformations, promising for industrial applications. However, issues with the scarcity and stability of Pt-group metals in catalysts have driven research towards alternatives.

2. Depositing 3d metals on Pt surfaces causes them to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures, impacting the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions.

3. Supporting Pt on tungsten carbide (WC) resulted in a synergistic effect, enhancing the selectivity of methanol reforming compared to Pt or WC alone.

4. Gold modification on WC surfaces blocked the active sites, decreasing the efficiency of methanol decomposition.

5. A key challenge for oxygen reduction catalysts in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) is the crossover of methanol through the polymer electrolyte membrane, leading to parasitic oxidation currents and blocking catalyst active sites.
