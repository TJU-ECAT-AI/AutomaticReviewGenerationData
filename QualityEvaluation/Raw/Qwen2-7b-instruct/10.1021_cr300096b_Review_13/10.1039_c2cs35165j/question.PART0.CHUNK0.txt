Metal overlayer on metal carbide substrate: unique bimetallic properties for catalysis and electrocatalysis Transition metal carbides often display electronic and catalytic properties that are similar to Pt-group metals. In this tutorial review, we describe the feasibility of replacing the Pt-group metal component in bimetallic systems with metal carbides. By supporting a metal monolayer on a carbide substrate, these bimetallic surfaces exhibit similar catalytic and electrocatalytic activity to the corresponding Pt-based bimetallic systems while demonstrating the advantages of lower cost and higher thermal stability. Another promising aspect is that the carbide substrates often promote the formation of small, flat metal particles with novel catalytic properties. We review the synthesis, characterization, and utilization of carbide-supported metal surfaces in heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis. An overview is given for both theoretical and experimental investigations, and trends are drawn from the literature. We also discuss opportunities for future research on carbide-supported metal surfaces.

I. Introduction
1.1. Unique properties of bimetallic surfaces
Bimetallic surfaces comprised of a host metal and an admetal have been shown to display unique electronic and chemical properties as compared to their parent metals. The modification effect is especially important when the admetal coverage is in the submonolayer to monolayer regime. Many combinations of host metals and admetals have been explored through surface science techniques, heterogeneous catalysis, and electrochemical experiments. There are two critical factors that contribute to the modification of the electronic and chemical properties of bimetallic surfaces: (1) the formation of hetero-atom bonds changes the electronic environment of the metal surface through the ligand effect and (2) the lattice mismatch between the host and admetals further modifies the electronic structure through the strain effect.1 The bimetallic systems have shown unique catalytic activities for hydrogenation of alkenes, aldehydes and conjugated molecules, reforming of oxygenate molecules to produce H2 and CO/CO2, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and ammonia to produce H2, and CO oxidation, among other catalytic reactions.2 Additionally, bimetallic catalysts have been used as electrocatalysts for methanol electrooxidation3 and oxygen reduction.4
1.2. Bimetallic surfaces from supporting metal over carbide substrates
The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are with Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location. For example, the structure with admetal on the top-most layer, designated as 3d-Pt(111), moves the d-band center closer to the Fermi level, and the structure with admetal in the subsurface region, designated as Pt-3d-Pt(111), shifts the d-band center away from the Fermi level. The d-band center correlates well with adsorbate binding energy and thus catalytic and electrocatalytic activity. The surface structure binds adsorbates strongly and is effective for decomposition reactions, while the subsurface structure has a weak adsorbate binding energy and is active for hydrogenation.1 The considerable range of reactions that Pt-based bimetallics catalyze holds promise for their application in the industrial and commercial sectors. However, these catalysts face significant problems relating to the scarcity of Pt-group metals and the stability of the surface and subsurface bimetallic structures under reaction conditions. Pt-group metals are among the least abundant elements in the earth crust.5 Geologists have estimated that if all vehicles worldwide utilize hydrogen fuel cells, the supply of Pt, at the current catalyst loading, would be exhausted within 15 years.6 Extensive research efforts have focused on reducing the amount of Pt in catalysts or replacing Pt altogether.
A promising alternative to replace Pt in these bimetallic catalysts are carbides of early transition metals, which exhibit unique properties not seen in their parent metals. Their surface chemistry for hydrocarbons and heteroatom-containing molecules has been reviewed,7 and the reactions of oxygenates on carbide surfaces have been recently discussed.8 Another advantage of carbides over Pt is their superior stability as a support for admetals. When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. Fig. 1 shows the thermally-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) Ni on Pt(111) from Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements.9 The Ni coverage decreases upon annealing and eventually reaches a value less than 0.2 ML at 800 K. The diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt results in the destruction of both surface NiPt(111) and subsurface PtNiPt(111) structures. The results of similar annealing experiments for Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil are included in the same figure.10Annealing the surface produces some decrease in Ni coverage, but not as drastic as for Ni/Pt(111), and the final coverage is 0.6 ML. WC is thus a much better diffusion barrier for admetals than Pt. The similar electronic and chemical properties of Pt and WC7 suggest that WC can potentially replace Pt in bimetallic systems, producing alternative bimetallic catalysts with lower cost and higher thermal stability. Another advantage of using carbides as supports is they often stabilize the formation of small, flat metal particles, leading to unique catalytic properties from the synergistic interaction of admetal particles and carbide substrates.

1.3. Scope of review
In the current tutorial review we aim to provide an overview of metal overlayers supported on carbide substrates: their synthesis, characterization, modeling, and catalytic/electrocatalytic evaluation. The synthesis of carbides and metal-modified carbides will be discussed for surface science experiments, heterogeneous catalysis, and electrochemical testing. Case studies will describe the replacement of Pt in Ni/Pt bimetallic systems with WC as less expensive and more stable catalysts. The main body of the review consists of a literature review of metal-modified carbides utilized for catalytic and electrocatalytic studies. Examples will be provided to illustrate the general trends and properties of metal-modified carbides. Finally, trends from these examples will be used as a basis to discuss future opportunities for further understanding and applications of metal-modified carbides.
II. Synthesis and modeling of metal-modified carbide surfaces
2.1. Synthesis of carbide surfaces on single crystals and polycrystalline foils
Carbide films on metal substrates can be prepared by a general procedure of exposing the metal surface to hydrocarbons and applying high temperatures to induce carburization. For the purpose of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface science experiments, carbide films on single crystal surfaces are synthesized by dosing unsaturated hydrocarbons and annealing to temperatures above 600 K. This treatment results in a carbon/metal ratio in the near-surface region close to that of bulk carbides and a characteristic low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern.11 For example, a carbide film on Mo(110) was prepared by first dosing ethylene on the clean Mo(110) surface at 600 K.12 Subsequent annealing of the C/Mo(110) surface to above 1150 K produced a C/Mo atomic ratio, as measured by AES, of 0.37 and an Auger C(KLL) lineshape characteristic of carbides. Repeated cycles of dosing C2H4 followed by annealing resulted in increased C/Mo ratios, but still maintained a p(4 × 4) LEED pattern up to a stoichiometry of C/Mo = 0.45, corresponding well to bulk molybdenum carbide (Mo2C). Carbide layers can also be synthesized on polycrystalline metal foils for both UHV experiments and atmospheric pressure electrochemistry. In UHV, tungsten monocarbide (WC) was prepared on a W foil by repeated cycles of sputtering ethylene at room temperature and annealing to 1100 K.13 The carbidic AES lineshape was observed, and the C/W ratio was close to unity as expected for WC. The similarity of this carbide film to carbide-modified single crystals was confirmed by observing that the decomposition of methanol followed the same reaction pathways on the WC film and the C/W(110) surface.14 Polycrystalline carbide foils for electrochemical experiments are typically synthesized by temperature programmed reaction (TPR) with a hydrocarbon/hydrogen mixture. Polycrystalline foils of Cr, Mo, and W carbides were prepared by flowing a CH4/H2 mixture in a quartz tube furnace while ramping the temperature to 11231473 K, depending on the metal carbide phase desired.15 Surface characterization techniques verified the presence of carbidic carbon and the expected carbon/metal ratio. One disadvantage with the TPR synthesis method is the unavoidable formation of noncarbidic carbon on the surface. For example, although some surface carbon on WC was removed with a H2 reducing atmosphere at 1123 K, the total removal was not possible.16 The presence of this surface C overlayer affected the catalytic activity of WC, such as toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). For 12 ML of surface carbon, the activity was mostly unchanged, but thicker C overlayers resulted in a noticeable decrease in the HER activity. The change in activity with greater amounts of surface C demonstrates that it is critical to limit carbon deposition by utilizing appropriate TPR synthesis conditions.16 Recently, an oxygen plasma treatment of as-synthesized WC was shown to selectively remove surface C while leaving carbidic C intact.17 Treated WC showed activity for methanol electrooxidation while as-synthesized WC was inert. Additionally, a Pt ML deposited on treated WC possessed hydrogen evolution activity nearly identical to Pt foil. These results indicate that selective removal of surface C from carbides significantly enhances their reactivity.
2.2. Metal deposition on carbide surfaces
For UHV surface science experiments, metal overlayers are typically deposited on the carbide substrates through physical vapor deposition (PVD). A common PVD method is evaporative deposition of a wire of the desired admetal wrapped around a resistively heated filament. Using this method, it is possible to deposit metal overlayers of various thickness; surface characterization techniques can be used to determine the amount of metal deposited on a substrate. Additionally, the growth mechanism of metal overlayers can be determined by observing the admetal signal as a function of deposition time. The resulting plot can be used to distinguish two common growth mechanisms: layer-by-layer or 3D island formation. Further details on characterization and metal overlayer growth can be found elsewhere.1 A representative case is the deposition of Pt on WC and W2C polycrystalline foils.18Fig. 2 shows the W4f and Pt4f X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) signals as a function of deposition time. As shown in panels (a) and (b), the Pt4f signal increased with deposition time, and the W4f signal decreased as it was screened by the Pt overlayer. The presence of distinct breaks in the slopes of both Pt4f and W4f signals near five minutes deposition time was likely caused by the screening of monolayer Pt by Pt atoms in the second layer, indicative of the completion of the first Pt layer through the layer-by-layer growth mechanism. The binding energy shift in the Pt4f 7/2 peak relative to bulk Pt foil, as given in panel (c), was also consistent with a layer-by-layer mechanism. A rapid change in peak position was observed for deposition time less than 5 min, likely due to direct interaction of monolayer Pt atoms with the carbide substrate. The more gradual change after 5 min suggested that Pt atoms became in contact with other Pt atoms as the peak position gradually approached to that of bulk Pt.

2.3. Density functional theory modeling of metal/carbide surfaces
Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been used to predict the electronic and chemical properties of metal-modified carbide surfaces. DFT is able to model the bulk structure, d-band orbitals, and charge distribution of surfaces, which can lead to an understanding of how admetals modify carbide surfaces. Also, the chemical reactivity of surfaces can be predicted; the binding energy of adsorbates can be calculated along with energy barriers for reactions. An example can be found in the work of Kitchin et al. on the close-packed surfaces of β-Mo2C, TiC, VC, NbC, and TaC.19 The bulk lattice constants of these carbides were predicted using DFT within 12% of the experimental values. The authors also calculated the d-band structure of Mo2C(0001) and showed that it shared characteristics with the d-band of Pt(111). DFT was applied to Pt-modified WC(0001) for the case of methanolreforming to compare the reaction networks on unmodified and Pt-modified surfaces.13 The reason for different selectivity on WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001) was explored by predicting the d-band partial density of states (PDOS). Furthermore, the d-band center of surface atoms had previously been shown to correlate with adsorbate binding energy.20 A d-band center closer to the Fermi level corresponds to high binding energy, and a d-band center far from the Fermi level results in low binding energy. This relationship also holds for metal-modified carbide surfaces, such as methanol adsorption on WC(0001), Pt/WC(0001), and Pt(100).13 Finally, DFT has been used to correlate hydrogen binding energy with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity on transition metal,21 bimetallic,22 and metal-modified carbide surfaces.18 Further examples of predicting activity with DFT calculations for catalysis and electrocatalysis will be discussed in Section 4.
III. Case study: replacing Pt substrate with WC for NiPt bimetallic surfaces
3.1. Cyclohexene hydrogenation over PtNiPt(111) and PtNiWC
In this section we will provide examples to demonstrate the feasibility of replacing Pt with WC while maintaining the same bimetallic activity. As mentioned in the Introduction, the subsurface configuration of the Ni/Pt(111) monolayer bimetallic system, PtNiPt(111), displays a unique low-temperature hydrogenation pathway that is not present on either Pt(111) or Ni(111). The origin of this unique pathway was correlated to the low binding energy of cyclohexene on PtNiPt(111) that was weaker than on either of the parent metal surfaces.1 Despite showing high hydrogenation activity, potential applications of the subsurface PtNiPt structure to heterogeneous catalysis face the problems of high Pt cost, as well as low thermal stability due to the inward diffusion of Ni into the Pt bulk. An alternative structure by replacing bulk Pt with WC, PtNiWC, was studied by DFT and surface science experiments for cyclohexene hydrogenation.10 The PtNiWC(0001) surface is shown in Fig. 3 with adsorbed cyclohexene. Using DFT, the cyclohexene binding energy on PtNiWC(0001) was found to be weaker than either Pt/WC(0001) or Ni/WC(0001). Parallel temperature programmed desorption (TPD) experiments confirmed that the PtNiWC subsurface structure showed higher hydrogenation activity than either of the monometallic metals on WC. Fig. 4 compares the hydrogenation yield as a function of cyclohexene binding energy for several bimetallic surfaces supported on Pt(111) and WC. A volcano-type relationship is observed between hydrogenation activity and cyclohexene binding energy with the PtNiPt(111) and PtNiWC subsurface structures showing higher cyclohexane yields than the other monometallic and bimetallic surfaces. The general similarity in the cyclohexene binding energy and cyclohexane yield of the two surfaces demonstrated that the PtNiWC surface was an effective substitute for PtNiPt(111) for hydrogenation reactions.

In addition to replacing the Pt substrate with WC, another advantage of PtNiWC over PtNiPt(111) was the enhanced thermal stability of metal overlayers on WC. This was examined by performing consecutive H2TPD experiments after annealing the surfaces to 800 K.10 For the PtNiPt(111) surface, the characteristic H2 desorption peak from the subsurface bimetallic structure disappeared after heating to 800 K, consistent with the diffusion of Ni into bulk Pt(111) at this temperature (Fig. 1). In contrast, for TPD experiments on PtNiWC, the subsequent TPD after heating to 800 K showed the same H2 desorption temperature and roughly the same peak area, confirming that the desirable subsurface bimetallic structure was more thermally stable on WC than on Pt(111).
3.2. Ethanolreforming over NiPt and NiWC
Another potential area where WC may replace Pt as a substrate material is for alcoholreforming to produce H2 and CO. Ren et al. studied how adding a monolayer of Ni to either polycrystalline Pt or polycrystalline WC affected the ethanol reforming activity.23 Previous research had shown that the NiPt(111) surface structure, with one ML Ni residing on top of Pt(111), was more active than Pt(111), Ni(111) and PtNiPt(111) for the reforming reaction.1 This trend is opposite of that for hydrogenation in Section 3.1 because the reforming reaction is favored on surfaces that bond to adsorbates more strongly.1 However, as shown in Fig. 1, the surface NiPt(111) structure is not thermally stable due to the diffusion of surface Ni atoms into the bulk. One possible solution is to replace NiPt(111) with NiWC. DFT calculations showed that the binding energy of ethanol on NiWC(0001) was 13.5 kcal mol1, close to the value of 15.6 calculated on NiPt(111).23 Furthermore, the binding energy of the first intermediate in decomposition, ethoxy, was also found to be very similar between the two surfaces. TPD was used to confirm the similar ethanolreforming activities of NiPt(111) and NiWC. Fig. 5 compares the TPD spectra obtained after dosing ethanol on a Pt foil, ML NiPt, polycrystalline WC, and ML NiWC.23 Substantial differences existed between pure Pt and NiPt surfaces. More hydrogen was produced from the NiPt surface as compared to Pt, suggesting a higher overall activity for ethanoldecomposition. The amounts of CH4 and CO desorbed from NiPt were much greater than from Pt, indicating that supporting a monolayer Ni on Pt enhanced CC bond cleavage. On clean WC, a high selectivity for breaking the CO bond was observed, since the main product was ethylene. After modifying WC with ML Ni, the reaction products observed were substantially different. No ethylene desorbed, and both CH4 and CO were produced. When the reaction products were quantified and compared between surfaces,23 the ML NiWC and NiPt surfaces showed similar product distribution and desorption temperatures for the production of CH4 and CO. Overall, the surface science results for ethanolreforming again confirmed the feasibility to replace bulk Pt with WC in NiPt bimetallic catalysts.

IV. Unique properties of metal/carbide surfaces
Examples in the previous section demonstrate the possibility of replacing the Pt substrate by WC in Pt-based bimetallic catalysts. The resulting metal-modified WC bimetallic surfaces have potential advantages of lower catalyst cost and higher thermal stability. In this section we will review the catalytic properties of metal-modified carbide systems for a wide range of catalysis and electrocatalysis applications.
4.1. Catalysis
4.1.1. Decomposition of alcohols The results in Fig. 5 reveal that the reaction pathways of ethanol on WC can be significantly modified by the addition of surface Ni atoms. Similar modification effects have been observed for the decomposition of other oxygenate molecules on several metal-modified carbide surfaces. Liu et al. studied methanol decomposition on C/W(111) and Pt-modified C/W(111).24 The C/W(111) surface in this case had a C/W ratio of 0.55, suggesting that the carbide film was closer to W2C than WC. On C/W(111), it was found that methanol decomposed by the following selectivity: 14% followed CO scission to form methane, 31% dehydrogenated to form CO, and 55% underwent complete decomposition to the constituent elements. The methanolTPD of C/W(111) modified by 0.6 ML Pt showed slightly lower activity and significantly different selectivity. No methane was produced, and the product selectivity was equally divided between CO production and complete decomposition. The unique selectivity of Pt-modified C/W(111) was explained by synergistic effects. As observed by high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS), unmodified C/W(111) was efficient at breaking the OH bond of methanol to form adsorbed methoxy, but was inefficient for CH cleavage. Pt is a well-known hydrogenation/dehydrogenation catalyst, and the addition of Pt to C/W(111) provided the active sites to dehydrogenate methoxy to CO. Subsequent research extended the study to Pt-modified WC films synthesized on a W polycrystalline foil.13 Besides having a 1:1 C:W stoichiometry, the polycrystalline WC film with multiple facets and grain boundaries should more accurately represent an actual catalyst surface. The selectivity for methanol decomposition was similar between single crystal C/W(111) and the WC polycrystalline films. Modification of the WC film with 0.5 ML Pt eliminated the CO scission for methane production, again consistent with the observation on the single crystal counterpart. Fig. 6 shows the correlation between the single crystal and polycrystalline surfaces by comparing the vibrational spectra from HREELS measurements for methanol adsorbed at 100 K on Pt(111), C/W(110), polycrystalline WC, and Pt-modified WC. The spectrum for Pt(111) shows peaks characteristic of adsorbed methanol, as indicated by the presence of the δ(OH) and ν(OH) modes at 770 and 3250 cm1, respectively. On C/W(110) and polycrystalline WC, features related to the OH bond of methanol disappeared, indicating the scission of OH to produce surface methoxy. Similar behavior was observed in the spectrum for Pt/WC. The comparison in Fig. 6 reveals that Pt-modified WC surfaces dissociate the OH bond of methanol more efficiently than Pt, leading to a higher decomposition activity by supporting Pt on WC.

The synergistic effect for methanolreforming on Pt/WC was explained in DFT calculations of reaction networks on Pt, WC and Pt/WC.13 As illustrated in Fig. 7, the OH bond scission was the first energetically favored step over both WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001), leading to the formation of the methoxy (CH3O*) intermediate. On unmodified WC(0001), the subsequent CO bond scission occurred to form CH3*, leading to the formation of CH4 by reacting with adsorbed hydrogen. In contrast, the presence of Pt on WC(0001) modified the subsequent decomposition pathway of CH3O* to favor the CH bond scission over CO bond cleavage, eventually leading to the formation of CO. These DFT predictions were confirmed in TPD and HREELS experiments.13 Overall, the combined DFT and experimental measurements demonstrated that the presence of Pt on WC resulted in a synergistic effect that made the Pt/WC surface more selective toward methanolreforming than either Pt or WC alone.

A subsequent study by Kelly et al. explored the possibility of supporting other late transition metals on WC for methanolreforming.25 Modifying WC with Ni or Rh gave even greater activity and selectivity for the production of H2 and CO than Pt/WC. On the other hand, Au modification simply blocked the active sites of WC, leading to a diminished activity for methanol decomposition. These results demonstrate that the WC surface can be modified with different types of admetals to control both the activity and selectivity of methanolreforming to produce H2 and CO.
In addition to transition metals, alkali metals such as potassium (K) and rubidium (Rb) have been used to modify the reaction pathways of metal carbides for alcoholdecomposition. K-promoted Mo2C has been the subject of surface science and reactor studies for alcoholreforming. The effect of K addition to a model single crystal carbide film, Mo2C/Mo(100), was examined by Farkas et al.26TPD and HREELS were performed for methanol decomposition on these surfaces. On unmodified Mo2C/Mo(100), the reaction products were a mix of H2, CH4, and CO. Modifying the surface with K led to an increase in the amount of H2 with a decrease in the amount of CH4. The authors proposed that K stabilized adsorbed methanol and prevented it from desorbing molecularly. After OH cleavage, the K-OCH3 species remained on the surface until 450550 K; coincident desorption of H2, CO, and K corresponded to decomposition of the K-OCH3 species. HREELS results supported this explanation, as well as the formation of some K-CH3 species. This K-CH3 species likely decomposed at a lower temperature than the K-OCH3 species, causing desorption of CH4. Similar behavior was observed for ethanol on Mo2C/Mo(100). The addition of K resulted in higher H2 and CH4 production and less C2H4 production. The interaction of methanol with K-modified Mo2C was further explored through DFT.27 On β-Mo2C(001) and 1/8 ML K on Mo2C(001), the methanol binding energy was identical at 0.39 eV. However, methanol adsorbed on a Mo top site on unmodified Mo2C, and it adsorbed on a K top site on K-modified Mo2C. Charge distribution was computed and the results revealed that on all surfaces, methanol transferred charge to the surface, becoming positively charged. Charge transfer was greater with K modification and methanol was more positively charged, leading to different bond scission sequences on Mo2C and K-Mo2C.
4.1.2. Decomposition of other oxygenate molecules The promising reforming activity of metal-modified WC opened possibilities for the production of H2 and CO from more complex oxygenates, such as polyols, aldehydes and acids. These oxygenates are major components from biomass pyrolysis and are a possible source of hydrogen or syngas through selective reforming. Recently, Yu et al. studied the reforming of C2 oxygenates with different functional groups, including ethylene glycol, acetaldehyde, and acetic acid on Ni-modified WC.28 The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, in the case of ethylene glycol, did not alter the bond-breaking selectivity observed for alcohols on WC or NiWC. Likewise, the presence of a CO double bond in acetaldehyde and the carboxylate group in acetic acid did not alter the main reaction pathways. The WC surface selectively cleaved the CO bonds of the three oxygenates to produce ethylene. Adding Ni to WC had the effect of shifting selectivity toward CC scission to produce C1 products with the CO bond intact. The same authors used glycolaldehyde (HOCH2CHO) as a probe molecule for the reforming of C6 sugars on NiWC.29Glycolaldehyde has both carbonyl and hydroxyl functional groups, and the same C/O ratio as larger sugar molecules such as glucose and fructose. TPD showed that glycolaldehyde was selectively deoxygenated to produce ethylene on WC, and followed the reforming pathway on NiWC. Furthermore, TPD and HREELS results following the reactions of ethylene glycol28 and glycolaldehyde29 on NiWC revealed similar reaction pathways and reforming product distributions for the two molecules, suggesting that the presence of the CO group should not significantly alter the reforming pathways of polyol molecules. Equally important, the product distribution for each oxygenate is similar between NiWC and NiPt(111),28,29 again confirming the feasibility to substitute Pt with WC in these bimetallic surfaces. 4.1.3. O2activation and CO oxidation Metal-modified carbides can be applied to heterogeneous catalysis involving the activation of O2 and subsequent oxidation reactions.30 Recent investigations in this area included Au clusters supported on TiC for CO oxidation by Roldan Cuenya and coworkers.31 Motivated by the unique reactivity of nanometer-sized Au supported on TiO2, Au/TiC was shown to be active for CO oxidation at low Au coverages. Subsequent scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) work demonstrated that Au at low coverages on TiC existed as nanoparticles with low height.32 The presence of a band gap in these low-height Au nanoparticles provided a possible explanation for their reactivity. Further investigations on Au/TiC for CO oxidation used photoemission experiments and DFT.33 The activation of O2 in UHV was studied on TiC(001) and Au-modified TiC(001) at different Au coverages. Interestingly, bare TiC(001) and 1.5 ML Au/TiC(001) had similar values for oxygen uptake, while the low-coverage Au/TiC(001) surfaces had a higher value. STM studies demonstrated that Au at 0.1 ML consisted of small, flat nanoparticles. Conversely, at 1.5 ML, Au forms three dimensional clusters. DFT modeling predicted that small, flat Au particles on TiC(001) have a high O2adsorption energy and low O2 dissociation barrier as compared to bare TiC(001) or large, 3D Au particles. When dosed at liquid nitrogen temperatures on Au/TiC(001) and subsequently heated, CO and O2 reacted to form CO2 at 140160 K; O2 dosed at this temperature was molecularly absorbed. When the surface was dosed with O2, then heated before dosing CO, the reaction to produce CO2 occurred above 400 K. These results suggested that the active species for the low temperature CO oxidation was molecular O2 with a weakened bond, which was then broken by interaction with CO. Dissociation of O2 by heating produced atomic O strongly bound on the TiC substrate, and these O atoms required high temperatures to remove. Additional insight was provided in a recent DFT study of CO adsorption on Au/TiC(001).34 Regardless of Au particle size, CO preferred to adsorb on Au atoms at the Au/TiC interface. CO had a higher adsorption energy on small, flat Au particles than larger, 3D particles, but had the highest adsorption energy on bare TiC(001). The experimental and theoretical work for CO oxidation on Au/TiC(001) suggested a bifunctional mechanism: CO adsorbed on the TiC substrate reacts with O2 molecularly absorbed on Au atoms at the Au/TiC interface. 4.1.4 H2activation and hydrodesulfurization (HDS) Au-modified TiC surfaces have also been evaluated for the dissociative adsorption of H2 and its impact on hydrogenation reactions, such as the hydrodesulfurization of thiophene. Rodriguez et al. have identified Au polarization as a possible explanation for the novel activity of Au/TiC(001) surfaces.35Thiophene did not decompose on either TiC(001) or Au/TiC(001) under UHV conditions, although an increased desorption temperature was observed on Au/TiC(001) with low Au coverages. A batch reactor experiment with co-fed thiophene and H2 established that 0.10.3 ML Au on TiC(001) showed thiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) activity, even higher than that of commercial Ni/MoSxcatalysts. Parallel charge transfer calculations showed greater electron density on flat Au particles than 3D particles; consequently, higher thiopheneadsorption energy was observed on the flat particles. In order to achieve high thiopheneadsorption energy and thus HDS activity, Au atoms needed to be in direct contact with both TiC and thiophene. Photoemission experiments on Au/TiC(001) revealed that the Au4f peak location varied with differing Au coverage.36Fig. 8 illustrates that the Au4f 7/2 binding energy at low coverages was higher than on bulk Au. This suggested a redistribution of charge for Au in direct contact with the TiC substrate, an observation that was consistent with charge transfer calculations. Another DFT study explored the high activity for H2 dissociation on Au/TiC(001).37 TiC(001) does have some activity for H2 dissociation, and the predicted barrier height on this surface was 0.52 eV. On small, flat Au particles supported on TiC(001), the barrier height was significantly decreased to 0.08 eV; however, on 3D Au particles, the barrier height was about 1 eV. On the Au particles, the atoms at the Au/carbide interface were the most favorable for H2 adsorption/dissociation. Once dissociated on flat Au particles, H atoms could diffuse onto the TiC substrate, but could not penetrate into the substrate. The TiC surface acted as a reservoir for H, leaving Au free to adsorb other molecules, such as thiophene, which then reacted with adsorbed H at the Au/TiC interface.

Since the novel reactivity of small, flat metal particles supported on TiC(001) was attributed to charge transfer from TiC(001) to the metal particle, DFT calculations were used to screen other metal/carbide systems. The (001) surfaces of TiC, VC, ZrC, and δ-MoC were studied as supports for small Au particles for H2activation using DFT.38 For Au on TiC and ZrC, H2 dissociated with one H atom on TiC and the other on Au. Au/TiC(001) showed a H2 dissociation barrier 0.17 eV lower than Au/ZrC(001), but the ZrC-based surface had an H2 adsorption energy 0.25 eV greater than the other carbide. This suggested that Au/ZrC(001) could be a better hydrogenation catalyst because H2 would be more likely to dissociate rather than desorb. For Au on VC and MoC, both H atoms remained on Au without spilling over to the carbide substrate. Additionally, while the H2 dissociation barrier was only 0.1 eV greater for these surfaces than Au/ZrC(001), the H2 adsorption energy was practically zero. The combination of high H2adsorption energy, moderate H2 dissociation barrier, and ability to act as an H reservoir suggest that Au/ZrC(001) would be an effective hydrogenation catalyst.
While polarization of the metal particle was the source of reactivity for Au/carbide systems, an overly high polarization could lead to an adsorbate binding energy that is too high for effective reaction. This was illustrated in the work of Gomez et al. on Pd, Pt, Cu, Au, and Ag particles supported on TiC(001).39 The adsorption energy of small, flat particles on TiC(001) followed the trend Pt > Pd  Cu  Au > Ag; a similar trend was observed for charge transfer from TiC(001) to the admetal. Pt and Pd on TiC(001) bound molecular H2 the strongest at 0.70.9 eV and had a large H2 dissociation barrier of 0.53 eV for Pd and 1.16 eV for Pt. Cu, Au, and Ag on TiC(001) had a thermoneutral molecular H2adsorption energy, and they had dissociation barriers of 0.08 eV for Au, 0.37 eV for Cu, and 0.79 eV for Ag. These values suggested that Au/TiC(001) and Cu/TiC(001) would be expected to be most effective for hydrogenation among these metal-modified TiC surfaces. From these cases, it was seen that Pt and Pd on TiC(001) were too strongly polarized, and the resulting strong adsorbate binding energy led to a high dissociation barrier energy, especially in comparison to the bulk metals. The moderate polarization of Au, Cu, and Ag caused a lower H2 dissociation barrier than the parent metals. These general trends show the possibility of predicting properties for metal/carbide surfaces from first principles, and thus giving insight for predicting their catalytic activity.
4.1.5. Watergas shift reaction An emerging catalytic application of metal-modified carbides is the watergas shift (WGS) reaction, wherein CO reacts with H2O to produce CO2 and H2. Carbides have been known to be active for WGS for several years, but only recently have they been used as supports for metals in reactor studies. Notable contributions have come from Thompson and coworkers, who have focused on metals supported on Mo2C.4042 Pt supported on Mo2C was shown to be more active than Pt on oxide supports for WGS.41Fig. 9(a) shows an Arrhenius plot for the CO consumption rate, normalized by mass of Pt. Pt/Mo2C was able to catalyze WGS at lower temperatures than Pt supported on reducible oxides (TiO2, CeO2) or an irreducible oxide (Al2O3). The reason for this enhanced reactivity was explored through modeling, electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Fig. 9(b) illustrates the conversion data on Pt/Mo2C as a function of Pt loading and compares it to predicted rates using models that separately emphasize surface sites and perimeter sites. The WGS rate decreased with increasing Pt loading, and the model that considered perimeter sites seemed to predict rates more accurately, suggesting that Pt/Mo2C was a bifunctional catalyst where both Pt and Mo2C participated in WGS. The results from DFT, XAS, and microscopy further confirmed the activity of perimeter Pt atoms in WGS. It seems that Pt formed flat, raft-like particles on Mo2C instead of the cuboctahedral particles that formed on carbon supports. As Pt loading increased, the particle diameter increased while the thickness remained constant. These particles had a high perimeter/volume ratio and may explain why Pt/Mo2C had a high WGS activity. Similar to the bifunctional nature of Au/TiC(001) discussed in the previous section, Pt atoms in direct contact with the Mo2C substrate and on the perimeter had the highest activity.

Although Pt/Mo2C possessed a high activity for WGS, it must also be resistant to potential poisoning species in feed streams. Since sulfur is found widely in fossil fuels and biomass, which are two major sources of CO, sulfur tolerance is a necessary trait for a WGS catalyst. The catalytic activity of Mo2C and Pt/Mo2C was assessed with a reactor feed containing H2S.40 Using a sulfur-free feed, Pt/Mo2C was almost an order of magnitude more active than Mo2C, and both catalysts were slightly deactivated after 1015 h on stream, likely due to carbon deposition. Addition of H2S to the feed stream caused quick deactivation to a miniscule H2 production rate. Removing H2S and carburizing in CH4/H2 recovered some activity for Mo2C, but Pt/Mo2C remained completely inactive. XPS measurements after different stages in the reactor experiment showed that most Mo2C sites were converted to MoS2 by H2S. Carburization recovered a fraction of Mo2C sites, but MoS2 remained. It appeared that Pt was irreversibly poisoned by sulfur deposition. The low tolerance of Pt/Mo2C towards sulfur suggests the need of searching for metal-modified carbides that are more sulfur-resistant and stable. Thompson and coworkers recently explored the synthesis and characterization of Mo2C-supported Pt, Pd, Cu, Co, Ni, and Fe42 as potential candidates for high activity and sulfur-tolerant WGS catalysts.
4.2. Electrocatalysis
4.2.1. Hydrogen oxidation and hydrogen evolution Another promising application for metal-modified carbides is energy conversion/storage, specifically using electrocatalysis. The simplest technology for energy conversion by electrocatalysis is a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) that utilizes hydrogen as a fuel, where H2 is oxidized at the anode and O2 is reduced to H2O at the cathode. The traditional electrocatalysts for PEMFC are typically Pt nanoparticles on a carbon support. These Pt/C electrocatalysts are active for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but encounter stability problems in the electrochemical environment. A potential replacement for Pt/C that utilizes carbides should have similar activity and better stability. Since CO is often a contaminant in H2 feed streams, and CO poisons Pt active sites, CO tolerance would be desirable in an electrocatalyst. Some early investigations studied Pt particles loaded on WC powders43 or mesoporous WC44 for the HOR. In the case of Pt supported on WC powders, X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that the powder phase was α-WC.43 The current normalized by mass of Pt was higher for Pt/WC than commercial Pt/C when measured at 0.45 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Another proposal is to replace Pt with another, less expensive metal that shows similar activity. Recent research identified a PdNi/WC catalyst as having high HOR activity.45 In CV measurements using an acid electrolyte, strong anodic currents were observed for Pd/WC in the H+ desorption region, and the current was even higher for PdNi/WC. XPS showed that the PdNi/WC catalysts did not undergo oxidation after CV measurements. All Pd/C electrocatalysts had low activity, suggesting a synergistic effect for the WC support. Actual fuel cell testing revealed that PdNi/WC electrocatalysts had maximum power densities similar to Pt/C and comparable stability after long operation. Using XAS techniques, it was suggested that electron transfer occurred from WC to the admetals, and from Ni to Pd. A linear correlation existed between the amount of metallic Pd and the maximum power density, with the lowest being C-supported samples and the highest being Pd3Ni2/WC.
Also of interest is the reverse reaction, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), for energy storage in the form of H2. In an investigation of Pt supported on WC powders for HER, Pt/WC and Pt/C catalysts showed qualitatively similar cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves; additionally, the exchange current density (io) on Pt/WC was the same order of magnitude as on Pt/C.46 When Pt was supported on a W2C microsphere, the exchange current density of a 7.5 wt% Pt/W2C catalyst was superior to that of a commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalyst.47 Esposito et al. performed HER experiments on WC polycrystalline foils modified with different amounts of Pt; the resulting Tafel plots are compared in Fig. 10(a).48 Unmodified WC showed a high overpotential for HER, but adding Pt to WC decreased the overpotential. For a 1 ML Pt/WC surface, the Tafel plot was very similar to Pt foil. Fig. 10(b) shows the exchange current density extracted from the Tafel plots. This confirmed what was qualitatively observed in the Tafel plots, that adding Pt to WC substantially increased the HER activity, and 1 ML Pt/WC was only marginally less active than Pt foil. The feasibility of synthesizing ML Pt over WC powders for HER was explored using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to load Pt on WC powders.49 After 30 cycles of Pt ALD on WC, activity equal to 10 wt% Pt/C was displayed. The 30 ALD cycles Pt/WC sample had a composition of 0.85 wt% Pt, which was a notable reduction in Pt loading compared to the carbon-supported catalyst.

Esposito et al. have extended the HER performance to other metals (Pd, Au) and other carbide substrates (W2C, Mo2C) using DFT calculations and electrochemical measurements.18Fig. 11 shows the io values determined from the Tafel plots for these surfaces plotted versus the corresponding DFT-calculated hydrogen binding energy (HBE) values. It is apparent that a volcano relationship was observed for the metal-modified carbide systems. The importance of this finding is that other metal-modified carbide surfaces may be effectively screened for HER activity based on their DFT-calculated HBE values.

4.2.2. Alcohol and CO oxidation While H2oxidation typically displays fast kinetics in a PEMFC, the utilization of H2 as fuel encounters potential difficulties in storage and safe transportation. Alternatively, small-chain alcohols have a high energy density and are easily transported since they are liquid at room temperature. Extensive research efforts have been devoted to direct alcoholfuel cells as potentially a better option for energy conversion. The simplest case is the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The traditional anode electrocatalyst for DMFC is Pt or a Pt-based alloy, typically PtRu. CO tolerance is even more important for DMFC anode materials, since CO is an intermediate in CH3OH electrooxidation. The function of Ru is to dissociate water at low potentials, providing hydroxyl species that can oxidize CO. A metal-modified carbide electrocatalyst for methanol electrooxidation should also have a high activity for CO oxidation. An illustration of the CO oxidation activity of Pt-modified WC was reported by Mellinger et al.50 A useful metric is the onset of oxidation in CO stripping voltammograms. The anodic peaks were observed near 0.75 V (NHE) on Pt foil and Pt/C, while those for WC/C and Pt/WC/C were at lower values, indicating that WC/C and Pt/WC/C oxidized CO at lower potentials than Pt/C and thus should be more CO-tolerant.
Ganesan et al. demonstrated the high methanol electrooxidation activity for Pt supported on W2C microspheres.51 Pt supported on W2C microspheres was well-dispersed, but PtRu particles aggregated when supported on carbon microspheres, as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These observations were confirmed by measurements of electrochemical surface area (ESA), which was about 35 times higher for Pt/W2C as compared to PtRu/C microspheres and commercial PtRu/C. The Pt/W2C samples showed higher activity when measured at 0.98 V vs.NHE, on both a mass-specific and ESA-specific basis. This research prompted investigations of Pt supported on mesoporous, phase-pure WC.52,53 Relative to Pt/W2C, Pt on mesoporous WC had a similar ESA.52 The authors compared the methanol electrooxidation activity of Pt on mesoporous WC to Pt/W2C, Pt on microporous WC, and commercial PtRu/C, with Pt on mesoporous WC showing mass activity superior to all others. The long-term electrooxidation activity of Pt on mesoporous WC was evaluated through chronopotentiometry (CP).53 In these experiments, Pt/C and Pt/WC samples were held at their peak current density, and the potential was recorded over time. A sudden potential increase of 0.5 V corresponded to Pt poisoning by CO and other intermediates. For Pt/C, the potential jumped after only 350 s, but Pt/WC maintained a steady potential for 1350 s. This demonstrated the high activity of Pt/WC for oxidizing poisoning intermediates.
From the surface science studies in Section 4.1.1 and Fig. 7, it was shown that Pt on WC foil was able to efficiently dehydrogenate CH3OH to CO, consistent with Pt/WC being an effective DMFC electrocatalyst. Electrochemical measurements on Pt/WC foils were performed to correlate DFT and UHV results with electrooxidation activity. Comparing the CV results, 0.8 ML Pt on WC foil showed an anodic peak for methanol oxidation at 0.6 V (NHE) and did not display any decrease in activity after 50 CV cycles, as shown in Fig. 12.54 The steady-state electrooxidation activity was evaluated by CA measurements, which are illustrated in Fig. 12e. At 0.65 V, WC and 0.8 ML Pt/WC had a higher steady-state current than Pt foil. This was likely due to a combination of Pt/WC activity for both methanolreforming and CO oxidation. Finally, a comparison of the W4f XPS spectra of WC and Pt/WC after CV measurements is in Fig. 12f. The peaks at higher binding energy, which correspond to W oxides, are much less intense for Pt/WC than WC. Based on these promising results, Pt supported on WC nanoparticles were loaded onto a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for DMFC testing.14 When normalized by mass of metal in anode, the Pt/WC MEA showed similar performance as a PtRu MEA. A different approach was used by Nishanth et al., who loaded PtRu particles on WC and MoC for DMFC.55 The two supports had different effects: some PtRu particles aggregated on WC, while they were well-dispersed on MoC. The CV measurements in a methanol/acid solution showed that PtRu/WC had slightly higher activity than PtRu/C, but PtRu/MoC had significantly higher activity. Actual DMFC testing gave maximum power densities of 90, 78, and 65 mW cm2 for PtRu/MoC, PtRu/WC, and PtRu/C, respectively. Finally, the carbide-supported particles were more stable, with the concentration of Ru dissolved from the catalysts being 46 ppb for PtRu/C and 1014 ppb for the carbide-supported PtRu. WC-based electrocatalysts have also been explored for DMFC application in alkaline environments. Pd-modified WC was studied using both UHV surface science and electrochemistry experiments for methanol electrooxidation.56 From UHV studies, 0.51 ML Pd on WC was shown to efficiently dehydrogenate methanol to CO and H2. Electrochemical experiments in a CH3OH/KOH electrolyte demonstrated Pd/WC activity similar to Pd foil. Like Pt/WC, Pd/WC possessed a higher steady-state electrooxidation current than Pd foil, most likely due to the greater CO tolerance of WC.

Direct ethanolfuel cells (DEFC) have attracted interest because ethanol can be produced from biorenewable resources. However, the CC bond is difficult to break electrocatalytically. For this reason, there are fewer reports in the literature of metal-modified carbides as DEFC anodes. Two contributions from Bozzini et al. examined ethanol electrooxidation on Pt-modified WC.57,58 A CV of WC in a CH3CH2OH/HClO4 solution showed no anodic peaks, but Pt-black supported on WC gave two anodic peaks in CV at 0.6 and 0.85 V vs. RHE.57In situFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to observe intermediates as a function of potential.58 Three types of IR bands were observed for adsorbed CO, C2 oxidation products, and liquid phase CO2. The lowest potential at which CO2 was observed was 0.55 V vs. RHE, a promising result that demonstrated complete oxidation of ethanol at a relatively low potential. Over the course of three separate experiments, the peaks for adsorbed CO became severely attenuated with each subsequent experiment. Additionally, increased peaks due to unreacted ethanol were observed at later experiments. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that particle agglomeration and decreased surface site density occurred on catalysts after potentiostatic measurements. More studies are needed to understand how to enhance the stability of Pt on WC for ethanol electrooxidation.
4.2.3. Oxygen reduction At the cathode of PEMFC, O2 is reduced to form watervia the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The discovery of a relatively inexpensive ORR catalyst is hampered by the sluggish kinetics and additional stability concerns of an O2-containing environment. Pt supported on WC has been applied to address this problem. In one case, W2C/C and Pt/C particles were supported together on a graphite electrode.59 ORR polarization curves showed no activity for an electrode with only W2C/C, but the electrode with Pt and W2C did show activity and had the lowest overpotential for the onset of reduction. A lower overpotential would result in greater voltage available in a fuel cell. Tafel analysis of the polarization curves calculated values for io almost two orders of magnitude higher for Pt/W2C as compared to Pt. A problem specific to ORR electrocatalysts in DMFC is methanol crossover through the PEM. The cathode is able to oxidize methanol, and this contributes a parasitic oxidation current and blocks catalyst active sites. Research has thus focused on optimizing catalysts with high ORR activity in the presence of methanol. In the same work,59 ORR polarization curves were recorded in a solution with added methanol. Pt/C showed anodic peaks for CH3OH oxidation that completely hindered ORR activity. In contrast, Pt/W2C showed less oxidation current and still retained ORR activity. At higher CH3OH concentrations, methanol oxidation will likely predominate over oxygen reduction, as expected from previous literature showing Pt/W2C as a highly active anode electrocatalyst.51 When Pt was supported on W2C microspheres, the ORR activity was also superior to Pt on carbon microspheres.60
The promising activity of Pt deposited on WC powders by ALD for HER had an analogous application of Pt ALD on WC foils for ORR.61 DFT was used to predict the binding energy of atomic oxygen as a descriptor of ORR activity. The value was 80 kcal mol1 higher on WC(0001) than Pt(111), but the ML Pt/WC(001) surface had an oxygen binding energy within 2 kcal mol1 of Pt(111). CV measurements in O2-saturated H2SO4 were performed on Pt/WC foils synthesized by different numbers of Pt ALD cycles. The reduction peak on the cathodic scan changed both in terms of peak potential and current density. As the number of ALD cycles increased, the peak potential increased from 0.3 V to 0.6 V vs.NHE and eventually coincided with the Pt foil value. Normalizing by the surface area of Pt, the peak current densities of low coverage of Pt/WC samples were higher than both WC and Pt foils, indicating a synergistic effect.
Yin et al. investigated the ORR performance of PdFeWC electrocatalysts supported on carbon.62 The reasoning for choosing this system was that PdFe catalysts had previously been shown to be active for ORR and tolerant to alcohol. Pd has a lower ORR activity than Pt, but is more alcohol tolerant, and Fe is thought to promote O adsorption. ORR polarization measurements showed the following trend for activity, normalized by mass: Pt/C > PdFe/C  PdFeWC/C > PdWC/C > Pd/C. The truly promising result of this PdFeWC/C system was in regards to alcohol tolerance. In solutions of methanol/acid and ethanol/acid, the Pd-containing electrocatalysts had no anodic peaks in CV, in contrast to Pt/C. Fig. 13 shows ORR polarization curves on (a) Pt/C and (b) PdFeWC/C in solutions with methanol and ethanol added. Substantial anodic currents were observed on Pt/C; additionally, the potential at the limiting ORR current was about 0.3 V less positive in alcohol-containing solutions, which would result in a notable decrease in cell voltage for a DAFC. The PdFeWC/C polarization curves with added alcohol showed very little difference from the ORR curve recorded in 0.5 M H2SO4. Thus, PdFeWC/C is potentially useful as a cathode electrode material because its components are less expensive and with greater tolerance to alcohol than Pt/C. It should be noted that although WC is stable under conditions for HER, HOR and alcohol oxidation, it is oxidized under ORR conditions.54 The instability of WC would most likely limit the application of metal-modified WC electrocatalysts for ORR applications.

V. Conclusions and future research opportunities
The current review leads to several conclusions regarding the general trends in metal-modified carbides: (1) For 3d/Pt bimetallic catalysts, replacing bulk Pt with WC retains the unique catalytic properties of the bimetallic surfaces, i.e., the subsurface PtNiWC structure for hydrogenation and the surface NiWC configuration for reforming reactions. (2) Supporting admetals on TiC often leads to the formation of small, flat metal particles that promote hydrogenation and oxidation reactions through synergistic interactions of adsorbates with both admetal particles and TiC. (3) Supporting monolayer precious metals on tungsten and molybdenum carbides shows promise in significantly reducing the precious metal loading in electrocatalysts, in particular for HER, HOR and alcohol oxidation.
Despite these promising properties, many fundamental and practical questions remain unanswered at present. The following is a list of future research opportunities aimed at addressing some of these questions: (1) More DFT calculations and electron spectroscopic measurements are needed to understand how the admetal-carbide interaction affects the electronic properties of metal-modified carbides. Such a property-activity relationship should lead to the prediction of desirable metal-modified carbides for specific catalytic or electrocatalytic reactions. (2) More experimental studies are needed to understand the potential synergistic effect, in particular whether or how a reaction would require the adsorbates to interact with both admetal and carbides. Systematic studies on metal-carbide systems with different admetal particle size and shape would be needed to understand such synergy. (3) In order to extend model surfaces to practical, supported catalysts, various synthesis methods need to be explored to produce coreshell structures of metal-coated carbide particles. Because the carbide cores would most likely be synthesized on a high surface area support for practical applications, the challenge would be to selectively deposit the metal overlayer on the carbide surface instead of on the support material. (4) More detailed efforts need to be devoted to understand the long term stability of metal-modified carbides for both catalytic and electrocatalytic applications. Of particular importance is how to minimize the accumulation of impurities/poisons on the metal overlayer and how to prevent the oxidation of the carbide substrates.
