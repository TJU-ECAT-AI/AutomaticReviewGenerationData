          [6] "The reason for different selectivity on WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001) was explored by predicting the d-band partial density of states (PDOS). Furthermore, the d-band center of surface atoms had previously been shown to correlate with adsorbate binding energy."
          [7] "The volcano relationship between HER activity (io) and hydrogen binding energy (HBE) for several metal-modified carbide surfaces."

      <English>
          The difference in selectivity between WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001) was studied by predicting the d-band partial density of states (PDOS). It was found that the d-band center of surface atoms correlates with adsorbate binding energy, and this correlation is important in understanding the selectivity of catalysts. The volcano relationship between HER activity (io) and hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on various metal-modified carbide surfaces indicates a predictive property-activity relationship for designing more effective HER catalysts.

          [8] "Supporting admetals on TiC often leads to the formation of small, flat metal particles that promote hydrogenation and oxidation reactions through synergistic interactions of adsorbates with both admetal particles and TiC."
          [9] "When deposited on Pt, 3d metals tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures."

      <English>
          Depositing admetals on TiC typically results in the formation of small, flat metal particles that facilitate hydrogenation and oxidation reactions through the cooperative interaction between adsorbates and both admetal particles and TiC. When 3d metals are deposited on Pt, they tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. The presence of Pt on WC leads to a synergistic effect, making the Pt/WC surface more selective for methanol reforming compared to Pt or WC alone.

          From Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements, there is a thermal-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) of Ni on Pt(111). Similar annealing experiments for Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil are depicted in the figure. It is evident that WC acts as a much better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt.
