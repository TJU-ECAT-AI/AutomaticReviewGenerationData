The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation arises because the stability of the subsurface configuration allows for a unique electronic environment that favors the adsorption and activation of hydrogen molecules. As a result, when designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces, researchers can predict and optimize the stability and reactivity of the catalysts by considering the thermodynamic properties of the bimetallic structures. This approach facilitates the development of catalysts that maintain the desired catalytic activity while improving stability and reducing costs.

The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are profound. By understanding how the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures influences their catalytic performance, scientists can create more accurate predictive models for catalyst design. This leads to the creation of catalysts with improved efficiency, selectivity, and longevity, which are crucial for industrial applications such as energy conversion and storage.

Moreover, the knowledge gained from studying the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures can guide the selection of appropriate materials for different catalytic processes. For instance, in hydrogenation reactions, the stability of the subsurface configuration ensures that the catalyst maintains its activity under high-temperature conditions, preventing the diffusion of precious metals into the bulk and preserving the catalyst's performance. Similarly, in oxidation reactions, the stability of the metal-carbide interface helps prevent the oxidation of the carbide substrate, which could otherwise lead to catalyst deactivation.

In summary, the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures plays a pivotal role in the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts. By leveraging this knowledge, researchers can develop catalysts with enhanced properties tailored for specific catalytic applications, ultimately contributing to more efficient and sustainable industrial processes.

[1] "The reason for this enhanced reactivity was explored through modeling, electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)."
[2] "The WGS rate decreased with increasing Pt loading, and the model that considered perimeter sites seemed to predict rates more accurately, suggesting that Pt/Mo2C was a bifunctional catalyst where both Pt and Mo2C participated in WGS."
[3] "It seems that Pt formed flat, raft-like particles on Mo2C instead of the cuboctahedral particles that formed on carbon supports."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by influencing the particle morphology and surface properties. As demonstrated in the literature, the enhanced reactivity of Pt/Mo2C catalysts for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is attributed to the formation of flat, raft-like Pt particles on the Mo2C surface instead of cuboctahedral particles on carbon supports. This morphology change is influenced by the stability of the Pt atoms in the subsurface configuration. The model that considered perimeter sites in predicting the WGS activity more accurately suggests that both Pt and Mo2C participate in the catalytic process, enhancing the overall reactivity. This correlation indicates that first principles calculations on model surfaces can provide insights into the design of more effective catalysts by predicting optimal particle shapes and surface compositions that lead to desired catalytic activities.
