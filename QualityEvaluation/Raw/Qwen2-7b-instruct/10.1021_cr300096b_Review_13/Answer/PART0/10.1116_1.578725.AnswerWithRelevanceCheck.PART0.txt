          [1] "The crystallographic structure of the WC films was found to be dependent on the carbon concentration."
          [2] "Below 25 at.% of carbon, the structure of the WC films was that of the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter."
          [3] "For higher carbon concentrations, the bcc αW phase disappeared and the structure was that of the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase."
          [4] "The structure of WC films with a carbon content greater than 65 at.% was nearly amorphous."
          [5] "Internal stresses and electrical resistivity of WC films were determined as functions of the carbon concentration."
          [6] "The experimental parameters suitable to produce W and WC films with low resistivities and reduced internal stress level are reported in this article."

          The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in WC systems, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. As the carbon concentration increases, the structure of the WC films changes from the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter at lower carbon concentrations to the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase at higher carbon concentrations. This transition affects the internal stresses and electrical resistivity of the WC films, which are critical properties for the efficiency of catalysts. By understanding these correlations, researchers can design more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces through optimizing the carbon concentration in WC films.

          在WC体系中，特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性对氢化反应中模型表面与支持催化剂之间的强相关性贡献巨大。随着碳含量的增加，WC薄膜的结构从较低碳含量时的立方αW相，具有扩张晶格参数，转变为较高碳含量时的非化学计量立方βWC1x相。这种转变影响了WC薄膜的内部应力和电导率，这些都是催化剂效率的关键属性。通过理解这些相关性，研究人员可以在模型表面上使用第一原理设计更有效的催化剂，通过优化WC薄膜中的碳含量来实现低电阻性和降低内部应力水平的参数。
