Answer: There are no specific quotes provided in the document regarding the thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures or their correlation with catalyst design for hydrogenation reactions. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer based solely on the information given.

The strong correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions can be attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms. Examples like the hydrogenation of carbon-carbon and carbon-monoxide bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials further illustrate how these models can predictably design catalysts that perform well in real-world applications.

The difference in selectivity between WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001) was studied by predicting the d-band partial density of states (PDOS). It was found that the d-band center of surface atoms correlates with adsorbate binding energy, and this correlation is important in understanding the selectivity of catalysts. The volcano relationship between HER activity (io) and hydrogen binding energy (HBE) on various metal-modified carbide surfaces indicates a predictive property-activity relationship for designing more effective HER catalysts.
