"The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions."
          "Several examples, such as the hydrogenation of CC and CO bonds over Pt3d bimetallic materials, also demonstrate a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, showing the promise of designing catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

[6] "The reason for different selectivity on WC(0001) and Pt/WC(0001) was explored by predicting the d-band partial density of states (PDOS). Furthermore, the d-band center of surface atoms had previously been shown to correlate with adsorbate binding energy."
