Depositing admetals on TiC often results in the formation of small, flat metal particles that facilitate hydrogenation and oxidation reactions through the synergistic interaction between adsorbates and both admetal particles and TiC. When 3d metals are deposited on Pt, they tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures.
