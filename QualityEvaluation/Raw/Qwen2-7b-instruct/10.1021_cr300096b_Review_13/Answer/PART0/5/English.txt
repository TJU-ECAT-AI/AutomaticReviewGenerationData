From Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) measurements, there is a thermal-induced change of 1 monolayer (ML) of Ni on Pt(111). Similar annealing experiments for Ni deposited on polycrystalline WC foil are depicted in the figure. It is evident that WC acts as a much better diffusion barrier for admetals compared to Pt.
