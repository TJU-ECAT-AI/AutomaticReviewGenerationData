Understanding the thermodynamic stability and correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts is crucial for extending the design of bimetallic catalysts to other types of reactions beyond hydrogenation.

Depositing admetals on TiC typically results in the formation of small, flat metal particles that facilitate hydrogenation and oxidation reactions through the cooperative interaction between adsorbates and both admetal particles and TiC. When 3d metals are deposited on Pt, they tend to diffuse into the bulk at high temperatures. The presence of Pt on WC leads to a synergistic effect, making the Pt/WC surface more selective for methanol reforming compared to Pt or WC alone.
