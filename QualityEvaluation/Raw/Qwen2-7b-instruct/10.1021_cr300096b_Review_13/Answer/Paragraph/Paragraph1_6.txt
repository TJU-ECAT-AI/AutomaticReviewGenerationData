        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cs2003593]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/ja208656v], [10.1116/1.578725], and [10.1021/cr300096b_13]. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a pivotal role in establishing a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios. Consequently, this correlation facilitates the design of more effective catalysts through computational methods and first principles approaches on model surfaces, enabling researchers to predict and optimize catalyst performance before physical synthesis and testing, thus saving time and resources.

        The crystallographic structure of the WC films is dependent on the carbon concentration. Below 25 atomic percent (at.%), the structure of the WC films is that of the cubic α-W phase with a dilated lattice parameter. For higher carbon concentrations, the body-centered cubic (bcc) α-W phase disappears and the structure transitions to the non-stoichiometric cubic β-WC1x phase. The structure of WC films with a carbon content greater than 65 at.% becomes nearly amorphous. Internal stresses and electrical resistivity of WC films are determined as functions of the carbon concentration, influencing their efficiency as catalysts.

        A new class of electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water electrolysis is presented, supported on low-cost transition metal carbides. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that understanding these structures can guide the design of more effective catalysts through first principles on model surfaces.

        The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under both UHV conditions and during the actual hydrogenation reactions, facilitating the design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

        Preparation of (Ga1xZnx)(N1xOx) photocatalysts from the reaction of NH3 with Ga2O3/ZnO and ZnGa2O4 is discussed. In situ time-resolved X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) studies provide insights into the preparation of these photocatalysts, highlighting the importance of these techniques in elucidating the properties and behavior of catalysts. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces are influenced by the location of the admetal, leading to unique catalytic activities such as hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation.

        The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are with Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location. The experimental parameters suitable to produce W and WC films with low resistivities and reduced internal stress levels are reported in this article. This study underscores the importance of understanding the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts for designing more effective catalysts through first principles on model surfaces.

        The crystallographic structure of the WC films is dependent on the carbon concentration. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in WC systems, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. As the carbon concentration increases, the structure of the WC films changes from the cubic α-W phase with a dilated lattice parameter at lower carbon concentrations to the non-stoichiometric cubic β-WC1x phase at higher carbon concentrations. This transition affects the internal stresses and electrical resistivity of the WC films, which are critical properties for the efficiency of catalysts.
