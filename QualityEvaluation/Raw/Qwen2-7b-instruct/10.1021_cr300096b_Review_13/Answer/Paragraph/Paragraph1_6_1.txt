        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cs2003593]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/ja208656v], [10.1116/1.578725], [10.1021/jp804551], and [10.1021/cr300096b_13]. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts through computational methods and first principles approaches on model surfaces.
