        The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios. Consequently, this correlation facilitates the design of more effective catalysts through computational methods and first principles approaches on model surfaces, enabling researchers to predict and optimize catalyst performance before physical synthesis and testing, thus saving time and resources.

        The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces are influenced by the location of the admetal, leading to unique catalytic activities such as hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, ensuring the desired structures remain intact under both ultrahigh vacuum conditions and during the actual hydrogenation reactions.

        The crystallographic structure of the WC films is dependent on the carbon concentration. Below 25 at.% of carbon, the structure of the WC films is that of the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter. For higher carbon concentrations, the bcc αW phase disappears, and the structure becomes the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase. This transition affects the internal stresses and electrical resistivity of the WC films, critical properties for the efficiency of catalysts.

        A new class of electrocatalysts for hydrogen production from water electrolysis involves metal monolayers supported on low-cost transition metal carbides. Understanding the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, has profound implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

        The experimental parameters suitable to produce W and WC films with low resistivities and reduced internal stress levels are reported in this article, providing insights into the preparation of (Ga1xZnx)(N1xOx) photocatalysts through the reaction of NH3 with Ga2O3/ZnO and ZnGa2O4.

        In situ time-resolved XRD and XAFS studies provide valuable information about the preparation of metal monolayers supported on low-cost transition metal carbides, highlighting the importance of these techniques in elucidating the properties and behavior of catalysts.

        Preparing metal monolayers supported on low-cost transition metal carbides requires careful consideration of the carbon concentration, as it significantly impacts the structure and, consequently, the properties and performance of the catalysts.

        The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are characterized by Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location, influencing their catalytic activities in hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation.

        The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-3d materials, attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, has significant implications for first-principles catalyst design. This correlation enables the prediction and optimization of catalyst performance, streamlining the development process and potentially leading to more efficient and effective catalysts.

        The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures ensures the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. This correlation allows researchers to anticipate and optimize catalyst performance before physical synthesis and testing, saving time and resources.

        By understanding the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures and their impact on the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts, researchers can design more effective catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. This knowledge is crucial for advancing the field of catalysis and enhancing the efficiency of hydrogen production processes.

        The future of catalyst design may focus on exploring emerging fields and innovative methodologies, leveraging the insights gained from understanding the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures.
