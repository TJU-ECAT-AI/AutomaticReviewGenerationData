        The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios. Consequently, this correlation facilitates the design of more effective catalysts through computational methods and first principles approaches on model surfaces, enabling researchers to predict and optimize catalyst performance before physical synthesis and testing, thus saving time and resources.

        The crystallographic structure of the WC films was found to be dependent on the carbon concentration. Below 25 at.% of carbon, the structure of the WC films was that of the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter. For higher carbon concentrations, the bcc αW phase disappeared and the structure was that of the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase. The structure of WC films with a carbon content greater than 65 at.% was nearly amorphous. Internal stresses and electrical resistivity of WC films were determined as functions of the carbon concentration, and the experimental parameters suitable to produce W and WC films with low resistivities and reduced internal stress level are reported in this article. 

        A New Class of Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Production from Water Electrolysis: Metal Monolayers Supported on Low-Cost Transition Metal Carbides also highlights the importance of understanding the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in the design of more effective catalysts. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces are influenced by the location of the admetal, leading to unique catalytic activities such as hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation.

        The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and during the actual hydrogenation reactions, which facilitates the design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

        Preparation of (Ga1xZnx)(N1xOx) photocatalysts from the reaction of NH3 with Ga2O3/ZnO and ZnGa2O4 provides further insights into the preparation of catalysts with optimized properties. In situ time-resolved XRD and XAFS studies have been instrumental in elucidating the properties and behavior of these catalysts. These findings underscore the importance of understanding the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in the development of efficient catalysts.

        The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are with Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location. This dependency suggests that the location of the admetal can significantly influence the catalytic activities of these surfaces.

        How does the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contribute to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, and what are the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces?
