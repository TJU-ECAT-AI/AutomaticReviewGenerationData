The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios.
