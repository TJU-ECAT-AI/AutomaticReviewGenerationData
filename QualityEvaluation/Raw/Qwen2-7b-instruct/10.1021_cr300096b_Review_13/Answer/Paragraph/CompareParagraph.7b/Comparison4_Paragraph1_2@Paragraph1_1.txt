    "Summary": "Both reviews excel in content quality, covering the topic comprehensively, providing accurate information, and integrating interdisciplinary perspectives effectively. They both offer insightful analyses, propose new research directions, and contribute to the field. However, they lack in clarity of methodology description and rigor of research design. Both have reasonable chapter arrangements and logical structures but could improve their introduction and conclusion sections. Their writing quality is fluent, and they use appropriate terminology, though they could be slightly more concise. Both reviews suggest feasible practical applications and address research limitations, showing critical thinking. Overall, they are equally strong, with minor differences in some aspects."
