        The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a pivotal role in establishing a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios. Consequently, this correlation facilitates the design of more effective catalysts through computational methods and first principles approaches on model surfaces, enabling researchers to predict and optimize catalyst performance before physical synthesis and testing, thus saving time and resources.

        The crystallographic structure of the WC films was found to be dependent on the carbon concentration. Below 25 at.% of carbon, the structure of the WC films was that of the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter. For higher carbon concentrations, the bcc αW phase disappeared and the structure was that of the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase. This transition affects the internal stresses and electrical resistivity of the WC films, which are critical properties for the efficiency of catalysts. By understanding these correlations, researchers can design more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces through optimizing the carbon concentration in WC films.

        The most extensively investigated bimetallic surfaces are with Pt as the host metal and 3d transition metals as admetals. The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces depend on the admetal location, leading to unique catalytic activities such as hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation.

        A New Class of Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Production from Water Electrolysis: Metal Monolayers Supported on Low-Cost Transition Metal Carbides, highlights the importance of understanding the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, in designing more effective catalysts. This understanding guides the design of catalysts through first principles on model surfaces, emphasizing the significance of these structures in establishing correlations between model surfaces and supported catalysts.

        The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in UHV environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under various conditions, facilitating the design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

        Preparation of (Ga1xZnx)(N1xOx) photocatalysts from the reaction of NH3 with Ga2O3/ZnO and ZnGa2O4, showcases the role of thermodynamic stability in the correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts. In situ time-resolved XRD and XAFS studies provide insights into the preparation of these photocatalysts, underscoring the importance of these techniques in elucidating the properties and behavior of catalysts.

        The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces are influenced by the location of the admetal, which can lead to unique catalytic activities such as hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation. Understanding these properties is essential for the design of more effective catalysts.

        The strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in bimetallic systems, particularly Pt-3d materials, for hydrogenation reactions, attributed to the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, has profound implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

        How does the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contribute to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, and what are the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces?
