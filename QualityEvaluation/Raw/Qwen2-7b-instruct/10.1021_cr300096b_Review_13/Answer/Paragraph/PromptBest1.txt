        The crystallographic structure of WC films, as detailed in \[10.1116/1.578725\], is found to be contingent upon the carbon concentration. Below 25 atomic percent (at.%), the structure consists of the cubic α-W phase with a dilated lattice parameter. At higher carbon concentrations, the bcc α-W phase disappears, transitioning to the nonstoichiometric cubic β-WC1x phase. This structural transformation impacts the internal stresses and electrical resistivity of the WC films, which are crucial for catalyst efficiency. By leveraging these correlations, researchers can design more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces by optimizing the carbon concentration in WC films, as evidenced in \[10.1116/1.578725\].
