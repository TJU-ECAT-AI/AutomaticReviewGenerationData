            Detailed analysis established from the study of reference [10.1021/cs2003593]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references [10.1021/ja208656v], [10.1116/1.578725], [10.1021/cr300096b_13], [10.1021/jp804551], [10.1039/c2cs35165j], and [10.1021/cs2003593].
            The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios. Consequently, this correlation facilitates the design of more effective catalysts through computational methods and first principles approaches on model surfaces, enabling researchers to predict and optimize catalyst performance before physical synthesis and testing, thus saving time and resources.

            The electronic and catalytic properties of 3d/Pt bimetallic surfaces are influenced by the location of the admetal, which can lead to unique catalytic activities such as hydrogenation, oxygenate reforming, dehydrogenation, and CO oxidation. Understanding these correlations can guide the design of more effective catalysts.

            The crystallographic structure of the WC films was found to be dependent on the carbon concentration. As the carbon concentration increases, the structure of the WC films changes from the cubic αW phase with a dilated lattice parameter at lower carbon concentrations to the nonstoichiometric cubic βWC1x phase at higher carbon concentrations. This transition affects the internal stresses and electrical resistivity of the WC films, which are critical properties for the efficiency of catalysts.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that understanding these structures can guide the design of more effective catalysts through first principles on model surfaces.

            The main reason for such strong correlations is that the desirable bimetallic structures for hydrogenation reactions, with subsurface 3d atoms underneath the surface Pt layer, are thermodynamically stable both in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) environment and under hydrogenation reaction conditions. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the desired structures remain intact under both ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions and during the actual hydrogenation reactions, which facilitates the design of catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

            The experimental parameters suitable to produce W and WC films with low resistivities and reduced internal stress level are reported in this article. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that by understanding and utilizing the principles derived from studying model surfaces, one can design more effective catalysts.

            In summary, the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation has profound implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. By understanding the detailed mechanisms outlined in the studies, researchers can tailor catalyst designs to optimize performance, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
