The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation means that the behavior of bimetallic structures on model surfaces can predict their performance as supported catalysts. By optimizing structure and composition through first principles modeling on model surfaces, the design of catalysts can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and selectivity.
