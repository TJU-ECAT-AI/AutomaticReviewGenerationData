[1] "The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions."
[2] "This correlation has significant implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces."

The thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures, especially those in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This connection allows for the design of more efficient catalysts through the application of first principles on model surfaces.
