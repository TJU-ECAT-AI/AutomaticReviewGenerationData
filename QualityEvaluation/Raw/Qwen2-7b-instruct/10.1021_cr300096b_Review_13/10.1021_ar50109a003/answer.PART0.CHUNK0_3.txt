1. The thermodynamic stability of bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms facilitates a strong link between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows for the prediction of catalyst performance based on theoretical models developed on simplified surfaces. 

2. The implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are significant. It enables researchers to understand the fundamental interactions and mechanisms occurring at the interface between metals and reactants. By modeling these interactions, scientists can optimize the composition, size, and structure of catalysts to enhance their efficiency and selectivity in hydrogenation processes. This approach can lead to the development of catalysts with improved activity, stability, and reduced environmental impact.
