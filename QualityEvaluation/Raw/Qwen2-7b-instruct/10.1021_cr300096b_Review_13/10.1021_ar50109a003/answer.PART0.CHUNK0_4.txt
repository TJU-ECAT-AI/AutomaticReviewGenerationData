The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially those containing subsurface 3d atoms in Pt-3d systems, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows researchers to design more effective catalysts by leveraging insights gained from studying model surfaces through first principles methods. By understanding how these bimetallic structures behave on a model surface, scientists can predict and optimize the performance of supported catalysts in real-world applications, leading to enhanced efficiency and selectivity in hydrogenation processes.
