The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation allows for a better understanding and prediction of catalyst performance based on model surface studies. By examining these bimetallic structures through first principles on model surfaces, researchers can design more effective catalysts optimized for hydrogenation reactions. The advantages of this approach include precise control over the catalyst structure and the ability to predict catalytic activity and selectivity, while the limitations might involve computational complexity and the challenge of accurately modeling real-world conditions.
