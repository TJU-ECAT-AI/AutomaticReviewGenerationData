1. Each mode of vibration contributes independently to the following thermodynamic properties: heat capacity (Cp), entropy (S), and heat of formation (ΔHf).
2. The vibrational frequency calculation procedure relies on numerically computing the Hessian matrix to determine force constants.
3. Metal atoms remained fixed during the relaxation process, while all atoms of the adsorbate were displaced by 0.02 Bohr in all three Cartesian directions.
4. The binding energy of ethylene glycol on Pt(111) is 11.4 kcal/mol, which aligns well with earlier calculations by Kandoi, who reported 13.1 kcal/mol.
5. Systematic patterns emerge from the calculations in this section that facilitate the quantitative prediction of properties for similar species like C2HxO2 diols.
6. The intermediate HOCHCH2O has two terms in the scaling relationship: one for the C-top metal site bond and another for the O-top metal site bond.

1. 每种振动模式独立贡献于以下热力学性质：热容量（Cp）、熵（S）和生成焓变化（ΔHf）。
2. 振动频率计算流程依赖于数值计算Hessian矩阵以确定力常数。
3. 在松弛过程中，金属原子保持固定状态，所有吸附剂原子在三个笛卡尔方向上被偏移了0.02 Bohr。
4. 乙二醇在Pt(111)上的结合能为11.4 kcal/mol，这与Kandoi先前的计算结果（13.1 kcal/mol）相吻合。
