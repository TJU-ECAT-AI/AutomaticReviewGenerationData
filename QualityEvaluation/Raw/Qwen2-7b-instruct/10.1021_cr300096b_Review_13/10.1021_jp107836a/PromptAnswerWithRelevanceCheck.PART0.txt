The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that by understanding the stability of adsorbates on model surfaces, we can design more effective catalysts. The document highlights that by applying linear scaling methods and group additivity, it is possible to predict the stability of larger oxygenates and bimetallic surfaces with reasonable accuracy. This predictive capability is crucial for advancing catalyst design and enhancing the efficiency of hydrogenation reactions.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that the behavior of model surfaces can effectively predict the performance of actual catalysts in hydrogenation processes. The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are profound, as it allows researchers to optimize catalyst properties computationally before physical synthesis, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency. The ability to accurately predict the stability and reactivity of adsorbates on these surfaces enables the selection of materials that will perform optimally in hydrogenation reactions, leading to the development of catalysts with enhanced selectivity and activity.
