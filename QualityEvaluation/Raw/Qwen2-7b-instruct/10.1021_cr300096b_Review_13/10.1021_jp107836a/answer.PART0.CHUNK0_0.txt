The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that by understanding the stability of adsorbates on model surfaces, we can design more effective catalysts. The document highlights that by applying linear scaling methods and group additivity, it is possible to predict the stability of larger oxygenates and bimetallic surfaces with reasonable accuracy. This predictive capability is crucial for advancing catalyst design and enhancing the efficiency of hydrogenation reactions.
