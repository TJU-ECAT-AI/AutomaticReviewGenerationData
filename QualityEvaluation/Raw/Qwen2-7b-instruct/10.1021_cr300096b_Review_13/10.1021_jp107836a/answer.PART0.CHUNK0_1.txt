[1] "The purpose of these gas-phase calculations is to use them as a reference for the binding energy calculations in the subsequent section. It is important to note the high instability of the OCH2CH2O species."
[2] "For example, Skoplyak et al. reported a binding energy of 61.0 kcal/mol for OCH2CH2O versus ours of 111.9 kcal/mol."
[3] "From this relative electronic energy (column 5, E  Eo, of Table 2), one can observe the most stable surface intermediate within each level of dehydrogenation."
[4] "As a method of analysis in the rest of this section, the intermediates are divided into two parts, each containing a CO center."

[6] "The observation that similar patterns are followed between the adsorption of C2HxO, C2HxO2, and C3HxO3 intermediates allows for the employment of specific rules to follow when using the group contributions presented in the proceeding section."
[7] "Additionally, second-order corrections can be added to increase the accuracy of predictions. Bensons book on group additivity (34) outlines several higher-order corrections for group additivity including but not limited to steric hindrance from gauche interactions and ring strain."
[8] "Ring strain is discussed at length in both Bensons book (34) and the work by Goddard and co-workers. (38)"
[9] "From the information in Table 2, ΔHf,298 values for adsorbed C2HxO2 species on Pt(111) are calculated using ethylene glycol in the gas phase and hydrogen adsorbed on a separate slab as a reference (these values are not corrected for temperature or ZPE)."
[10] "As shown in Figure 5, the proposed group additivity method is viable as a screening technique to identify trends in reaction intermediate stability."
