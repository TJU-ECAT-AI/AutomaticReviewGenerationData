[1] "Within this framework, each mode of vibration contributes independently to following thermodynamic properties: (1) (2) (3) The summations in eqs 13 are over each vibrational frequency (i)."
[2] "It should also be noted that the configurations predicted for these outlying cases are within 5 kcal/mol of the most stable configuration calculated herein, and thus the proposed framework is adequate."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes significantly to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that the behavior of model surfaces can effectively predict the performance of actual catalysts in hydrogenation processes. The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are profound, as it allows researchers to optimize catalyst properties computationally before physical synthesis, potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency. The ability to accurately predict the stability and reactivity of adsorbates on these surfaces enables the selection of materials that will perform optimally in hydrogenation reactions, leading to the development of catalysts with enhanced selectivity and activity.
