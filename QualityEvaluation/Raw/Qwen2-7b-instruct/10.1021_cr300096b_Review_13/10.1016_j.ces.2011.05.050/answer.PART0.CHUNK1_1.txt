In the context of catalytic chemistry, the development of multiscale modeling has enabled the prediction of novel catalytic materials while accounting for catalyst molecular architecture, catalytic kinetics, and reactor effects, and addressing the emergent behavior of electronic and catalytic properties. This approach combines microkinetic modeling, input via semi-empirical methods, such as the bond-order conservation (BOC), group additivity (GA), linear scaling relations and BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations derived from DFT, an optimization with respect to atomic binding energies, stability studies via DFT and/or MD under working conditions (based on most abundant surface intermediate), database generation of binding energies via DFT on different structures, materials selection based on optimization and database results, hierarchical refinement of the models of novel materials via higher level theory, and lab testing for promising candidates.

Ab initio or first-principles KMC simulations have shown predictive power, stemming from the fundamental description of elementary surface processes at the quantum level, coupled with a statisticalmechanical description of the dynamics at the molecular level. These simulations enable the detailed and accurate modeling of complexities such as spatial heterogeneities of surfaces and reactivity, competition effects, and complex dynamical behavior, which play a significant role in determining catalyst performance.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that models of bimetallic structures can effectively predict the behavior of supported catalysts, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

The rather limited number of computational studies indicates that at elevated temperatures relevant to catalytic chemistry, the catalyst structure may be very dynamic. As a result, an ensemble of structures needs to be considered for estimating kinetics over the time scale of slow reaction events. Multiscale methods can be integrated with electronic structure calculations for the determination of chemical properties of these materials, providing a comprehensive framework for computational design and screening of catalytic materials.

Multiscale modeling in catalytic chemistry allows for the prediction of novel materials while considering molecular architecture, catalytic kinetics, and reactor effects. This approach utilizes microkinetic modeling, semi-empirical methods like BOC, GA, BEP relations, and optimization of atomic binding energies. It also accounts for the dynamic behavior of catalyst structures at elevated temperatures, enabling detailed modeling of complex reactions and improving catalyst design. Computational studies suggest that bimetallic structures correlate well with supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, facilitating the use of model surfaces for effective catalyst design. Multiscale methods combined with electronic structure calculations offer a comprehensive framework for the computational screening of catalytic materials.
