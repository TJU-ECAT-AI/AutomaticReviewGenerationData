1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation has significant implications for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. By comprehending the thermodynamics of these bimetallic structures, one can anticipate and optimize the activity and selectivity of supported catalysts.
