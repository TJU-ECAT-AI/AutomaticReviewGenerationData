1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation enables predictions of hydrogenation reaction behavior on model surfaces to reliably forecast the performance of industrial catalysts.

2. This correlation implies that the behavior of hydrogenation reactions on model surfaces can predictably mirror the performance of supported catalysts in real-world applications.

3. The implications for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces are substantial, as accurate predictions can be made about catalyst performance without extensive experimental validation.

1. 特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是在Pt-3d系统中具有亚表面3d原子的结构，显著促进了模型表面和支持催化剂在氢化反应中的强相关性。这种相关性表明，模型表面上的氢化反应行为可以可靠地预测工业催化剂的实际性能。

2. 这种相关性意味着模型表面上的氢化反应行为可以准确反映工业催化剂的实际应用表现。

3. 使用模型表面的第一原理设计更有效的催化剂具有重大意义，因为可以准确预测催化剂性能，无需进行大量实验验证。
