In the context of catalytic chemistry, the development of multiscale modeling has enabled the prediction of novel catalytic materials while accounting for catalyst molecular architecture, catalytic kinetics, and reactor effects, and addressing the emergent behavior of electronic and catalytic properties. This approach combines microkinetic modeling, input via semi-empirical methods, such as the bond-order conservation (BOC), group additivity (GA), linear scaling relations and BrnstedEvansPolanyi (BEP) relations derived from DFT, an optimization with respect to atomic binding energies, stability studies via DFT and/or MD under working conditions (based on most abundant surface intermediate), database generation of binding energies via DFT on different structures, materials selection based on optimization and database results, hierarchical refinement of the models of novel materials via higher level theory, and lab testing for promising candidates.

Ab initio or first-principles KMC simulations have shown predictive power, stemming from the fundamental description of elementary surface processes at the quantum level, coupled with a statisticalmechanical description of the dynamics at the molecular level. These simulations enable the detailed and accurate modeling of complexities such as spatial heterogeneities of surfaces and reactivity, competition effects, and complex dynamical behavior, which play a significant role in determining catalyst performance.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that models of bimetallic structures can effectively predict the behavior of supported catalysts, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces.

The rather limited number of computational studies indicates that at elevated temperatures relevant to catalytic chemistry, the catalyst structure may be very dynamic. As a result, an ensemble of structures needs to be considered for estimating kinetics over the time scale of slow reaction events. Multiscale methods can be integrated with electronic structure calculations for the determination of chemical properties of these materials, providing a comprehensive framework for computational design and screening of catalytic materials.

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The stability of these structures contributes to their reactivity and selectivity, leading to enhanced performance in hydrogenation processes. This correlation allows for the accurate prediction of catalyst behavior on model surfaces, which can then be scaled up to supported catalysts. Using first principles on model surfaces helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms of these structures, enabling the design of more effective catalysts. The insights gained from studying bimetallic systems on model surfaces can guide the synthesis of catalysts with desired properties, enhancing their efficiency in hydrogenation reactions.

The implications of this correlation are significant for catalyst design. It facilitates the computational screening of potential catalyst candidates, predicting their performance before synthesis. This approach saves time and resources by eliminating the need for extensive trial-and-error experiments. Additionally, it aids in understanding the role of structural parameters, such as coordination numbers and curvature angles, in determining the catalytic activity and stability of bimetallic systems. This knowledge can be leveraged to engineer catalysts with optimized structures, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity.

The experimental data from Auger spectroscopy indicate that the mixing of Ni and Pt at higher temperatures occurs on the order of seconds to minutes. This finding highlights the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts and the importance of considering kinetic aspects in their design. Understanding the dynamics of mixing between metals at different temperatures is crucial for predicting the behavior of catalysts under operational conditions. It informs the choice of synthesis methods and the optimization of reaction parameters to achieve the desired catalyst structure, ultimately influencing its catalytic performance.

[1] "The inclusion of highest level theory at each scale ( Fig. 1 ) is computationally intractable. For this reason, the hierarchical multiscale modeling framework was introduced ( Vlachos et al., 2006 ) the essence of which is a simple, yet powerful procedure. One starts with a sufficiently simple but physically relevant model at each scale and performs a sensitivity analysis ( Mhadeshwar and Vlachos, 2005b , Mhadeshwar and Vlachos, 2005c , Mhadeshwar and Vlachos, 2007 ), i.e., one uses a model at or near the left of the hierarchy of each scale in Fig. 1 . Upon identification of the important scale and parameter(s), higher level theory can be used to improve the accuracy of the parameter(s) in the relevant scale. The procedure needs to be iterated until the important parameters do not change between iterations."

Answer: This quote explains the hierarchical multiscale modeling framework, which begins with simple, yet relevant models at each scale and iteratively refines them by applying higher-level theories to improve the accuracy of parameters.

In the context of catalytic chemistry, the binding energies of species play a crucial role in determining the activity of a catalyst. This is often described by Sabatier's principle, which indicates that optimal activity is achieved when the binding energies of species are intermediate in magnitude. As a result, the activity of a catalyst can often be described in terms of the binding energy of a single species, referred to as a single descriptor. This approach simplifies the prediction of catalyst activity and has been used in the development of bimetallic catalysts. For instance, in the case of ammonia synthesis, it was found that a catalyst with an intermediate binding energy for nitrogen, obtained by combining metals with high and low nitrogen binding energies, showed comparable activity to the best single metal catalyst, ruthenium. This approach has been successful in predicting catalyst performance for various reactions, including ammonia synthesis, methanation, and glycerol decomposition. However, it has limitations, particularly when dealing with catalysts for which little fundamental research has been conducted or when the dominant species changes with operating conditions. The use of a multiscale model can address these limitations by allowing for the prediction of optimal properties based on multiple descriptors, such as activity, selectivity, cost, and hot spots, while still utilizing the interpolation principle of the periodic table.

The text discusses the use of first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations in predicting the activity of catalysts for ammonia decomposition. It mentions the development of a microkinetic model for ammonia decomposition on a platinum catalyst, which involves estimating the binding energies of various intermediates using the group additivity technique. The model then refines these estimates using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain more accurate predictions of reaction barriers. This hierarchical refinement process leads to the identification of the most probable reaction pathways for ammonia decomposition on the Pt(111) surface. The text also notes the importance of considering lateral interactions between adsorbates in the KMC simulations, as neglecting strong nearest-neighbor (NN) repulsion can lead to incorrect predictions of optimal catalyst properties. The DFT calculations are crucial in refining the model parameters and predicting the activity of the catalyst. The text further emphasizes the role of uncertainty analysis in understanding the impact of parametric uncertainty and lateral interactions on the identification of optimal catalyst properties.
