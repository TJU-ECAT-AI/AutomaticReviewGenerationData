In the context of catalytic chemistry, the binding energies of species play a crucial role in determining the activity of a catalyst. This is often described by Sabatier's principle, which indicates that optimal activity is achieved when the binding energies of species are intermediate in magnitude. As a result, the activity of a catalyst can often be described in terms of the binding energy of a single species, referred to as a single descriptor. This approach simplifies the prediction of catalyst activity and has been used in the development of bimetallic catalysts. For instance, in the case of ammonia synthesis, it was found that a catalyst with an intermediate binding energy for nitrogen, obtained by combining metals with high and low nitrogen binding energies, showed comparable activity to the best single metal catalyst, ruthenium. This approach has been successful in predicting catalyst performance for various reactions, including ammonia synthesis, methanation, and glycerol decomposition. However, it has limitations, particularly when dealing with catalysts for which little fundamental research has been conducted or when the dominant species changes with operating conditions. The use of a multiscale model can address these limitations by allowing for the prediction of optimal properties based on multiple descriptors, such as activity, selectivity, cost, and hot spots, while still utilizing the interpolation principle of the periodic table.

The binding energies of species on a catalyst's surface are critical in determining its activity. Sabatier's principle suggests that optimal activity is achieved with intermediate binding energies. This principle allows the description of catalyst activity through a single descriptor, the binding energy of a single species. This has facilitated the prediction of catalyst performance for reactions like ammonia synthesis and glycerol decomposition. However, its limitations arise in cases where there is a lack of fundamental research on a catalyst or when the dominant species changes with operating conditions. Multiscale modeling can overcome these limitations by enabling the prediction of optimal properties based on multiple descriptors, such as activity, selectivity, cost, and hot spots, while still relying on the periodic table's interpolation principle.

催化活性的表面物种结合能对于确定其活性至关重要。萨巴提尔原理表明，最优活性需要中等大小的结合能。这一原理允许通过单一描述符，即单个物种的结合能来描述催化剂活性，这在氨合成和甘油分解反应的催化剂性能预测中取得了成功。然而，在缺乏对催化剂的基本研究或当活性物种随操作条件变化时，这种方法存在局限性。多尺度建模可以克服这些局限性，通过基于多个描述符（如活性、选择性、成本和热点）来预测最佳性能，同时仍然依赖于周期表的插值原则。

The text discusses the use of first-principles kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations in predicting the activity of catalysts for ammonia decomposition. It mentions the development of a microkinetic model for ammonia decomposition on a platinum catalyst, which involves estimating the binding energies of various intermediates using the group additivity technique. The model then refines these estimates using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain more accurate predictions of reaction barriers. This hierarchical refinement process leads to the identification of the most probable reaction pathways for ammonia decomposition on the Pt(111) surface. The text also notes the importance of considering lateral interactions between adsorbates in the KMC simulations, as neglecting strong nearest-neighbor (NN) repulsion can lead to incorrect predictions of optimal catalyst properties. The DFT calculations are crucial in refining the model parameters and predicting the activity of the catalyst. The text further emphasizes the role of uncertainty analysis in understanding the impact of parametric uncertainty and lateral interactions on the identification of optimal catalyst properties.

The text discusses the challenges faced in incorporating the effect of lateral interactions in a microkinetic model, particularly when mapping from density functional theory (DFT) to mean-field models and dealing with the large number of DFT calculations required for multicomponent systems. It introduces the concept of hierarchical modeling, where models without adsorbate-adsorbate interactions (or with interactions included for specific species) are used to probe sensitive parameters and abundant surface intermediates. The text explains how the identification of the most abundant surface intermediates (MAIS) can significantly reduce computational costs. It also mentions the use of a posteriori analysis, which involves reassessing model parameters through DFT calculations in the presence of predicted abundant intermediates. The text provides an example of hierarchical model refinement and comparison to experimental data for the ammonia decomposition reaction, illustrating how DFT calculations can be incorporated into the model to refine parameters. The text further discusses the importance of accurate coverage dependencies within the model and the development of inexpensive predictive models that can include important adsorbate-adsorbate interactions within the microkinetic modeling framework.
