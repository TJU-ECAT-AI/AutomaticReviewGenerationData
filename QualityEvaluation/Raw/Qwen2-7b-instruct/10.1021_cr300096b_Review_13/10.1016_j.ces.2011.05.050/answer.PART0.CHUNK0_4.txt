<p>It is commonplace to assume that the catalyst is static over the time scale of a chemical reaction. In reality, the catalyst is dynamic in response to its local environment, such as the gases and adsorbates present, the temperature, the pressure, etc. Catalyst dynamics, such as reconstruction and isomerization between various conformations, maybe more common than we currently think, but their effect on the kinetics of catalytic reactions is poorly understood.</p>

1. The catalyst's dynamics, including its reconstruction and isomerization between different conformations, might be more prevalent than currently acknowledged. However, the impact of these dynamics on the kinetics of catalytic reactions remains poorly understood.
