The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. The stability of these structures contributes to their reactivity and selectivity, leading to enhanced performance in hydrogenation processes. This correlation allows for the accurate prediction of catalyst behavior on model surfaces, which can then be scaled up to supported catalysts. Using first principles on model surfaces helps in understanding the underlying mechanisms of these structures, enabling the design of more effective catalysts. The insights gained from studying bimetallic systems on model surfaces can guide the synthesis of catalysts with desired properties, enhancing their efficiency in hydrogenation reactions.

The implications of this correlation are significant for catalyst design. It facilitates the computational screening of potential catalyst candidates, predicting their performance before synthesis. This approach saves time and resources by eliminating the need for extensive trial-and-error experiments. Additionally, it aids in understanding the role of structural parameters, such as coordination numbers and curvature angles, in determining the catalytic activity and stability of bimetallic systems. This knowledge can be leveraged to engineer catalysts with optimized structures, leading to enhanced activity and selectivity.

The experimental data from Auger spectroscopy indicate that the mixing of Ni and Pt at higher temperatures occurs on the order of seconds to minutes. This finding highlights the dynamic nature of bimetallic catalysts and the importance of considering kinetic aspects in their design. Understanding the dynamics of mixing between metals at different temperatures is crucial for predicting the behavior of catalysts under operational conditions. It informs the choice of synthesis methods and the optimization of reaction parameters to achieve the desired catalyst structure, ultimately influencing its catalytic performance.
