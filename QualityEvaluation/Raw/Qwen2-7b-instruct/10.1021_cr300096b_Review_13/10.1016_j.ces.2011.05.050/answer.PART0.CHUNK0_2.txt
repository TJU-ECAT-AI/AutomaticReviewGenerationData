[1] "The inclusion of highest level theory at each scale ( Fig. 1 ) is computationally intractable. For this reason, the hierarchical multiscale modeling framework was introduced ( Vlachos et al., 2006 ) the essence of which is a simple, yet powerful procedure. One starts with a sufficiently simple but physically relevant model at each scale and performs a sensitivity analysis ( Mhadeshwar and Vlachos, 2005b , Mhadeshwar and Vlachos, 2005c , Mhadeshwar and Vlachos, 2007 ), i.e., one uses a model at or near the left of the hierarchy of each scale in Fig. 1 . Upon identification of the important scale and parameter(s), higher level theory can be used to improve the accuracy of the parameter(s) in the relevant scale. The procedure needs to be iterated until the important parameters do not change between iterations."

Answer: This quote explains the hierarchical multiscale modeling framework, which begins with simple, yet relevant models at each scale and iteratively refines them by applying higher-level theories to improve the accuracy of parameters. The process continues until the parameters stabilize, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in managing the complexity of catalytic reactions.

这段引文解释了层次多尺度建模框架，它从每个尺度上开始构建简单且具有物理相关性的模型，并通过应用更高层次的理论逐步提高参数的准确性。该过程会迭代进行，直到参数稳定为止，这证明了该方法在管理催化反应复杂性方面的有效性。
