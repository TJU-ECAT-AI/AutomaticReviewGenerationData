The literature highlights the importance of multiscale modeling in the development of catalytic reaction mechanisms, emphasizing the need for mechanism development and application to complex and emergent systems. It discusses the estimation of thermochemistry and kinetics through hierarchical multiscale methods, computation-driven catalyst design leading to the discovery of materials with emergent behavior, the consideration of uncertainty in catalyst design, and the examination of particle effects and structure sensitivity of reactions. The paper further delves into free energies in solution and the role of solvent effects in catalytic reactions. The review places significant emphasis on mean-field microkinetic models and their hierarchical multiscale refinement for enhancing the understanding and simulation of catalytic processes.
