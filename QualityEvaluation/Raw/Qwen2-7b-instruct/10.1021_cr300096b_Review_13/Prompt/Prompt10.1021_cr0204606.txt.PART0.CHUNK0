1. Introduction
Transition metal carbides (TMCs) are produced by incorporating carbon atoms into the interstitial sites of their parent metals, which typically include all 3d elements and 4d/5d elements of groups 36 early transition metals. In general, TMCs of early transition metals possess unique physical and chemical properties. 1-6 For example, TMC compounds combine the physical properties of three different classes of materials: covalent solids, ionic crystals, and transition metals. As a result, TMC compounds often demonstrate the extreme hardness of covalent solids, the high melting temperature of ionic crystals, and the excellent electric and thermal conductivity of transition metals. The unique combination of these desirable physical properties has led to the commercial applications of TMCs as cutting tools1 and hard-coating materials.3 In addition, TMCs of groups 46 early transition metals are characterized by many unique and intriguing catalytic properties. Ever since the landmark paper by Levy and Boudart regarding the Pt-like properties of tungsten carbides, 7 the catalytic properties of TMCs have been the subject of many investigations in the fields of catalysis and surface science. From the catalysis literature it is now well established that the catalytic properties of TMCs often show strong similarity to those of the more expensive Pt-group metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt).6 In particular, in reactions involving the transformation of CH bonds of hydrocarbons, such as dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and hydrogenolysis, the catalytic performances of TMCs are approaching or surpassing those of Pt-group metals.2,5,6 The catalytic and electrocatalytic properties of group 6 carbides have also been the subject of many investigations because of their potential application as alternative electrocatalysts in hydrogen and methanol fuel cells. 8-11 Experimental and theoretical surface science studies have played an important role in confirming and understanding the similar surface properties of TMCs to those of Pt-group metals. In particular, TMC surfaces offer excellent model systems to determine how the electronic properties of metal surfaces are modified by the incorporation of carbon and how the electronic modifications in turn alter the surface chemical properties. The objectives of the current review are primarily twofold: (1) to demonstrate the general similarities and differences in the surface chemistry of TMC surfaces and (2) to correlate the chemical properties with the underlying electronic properties of TMC surfaces.
There were several comprehensive reviews on the various properties of TMCs. Johansson reviewed the electronic properties of bulk single-crystal TMCs in 1995. 12 The chemical and catalytic properties of powder and supported TMC catalysts were reviewed by Oyama in 1996.5 The preparation, characterization, and reactivities of TMC surfaces were reviewed by Chen in 1996.6 The characterization of the local structural and electronic properties of single-crystal and polycrystalline TMCs was reviewed by Chen in 1997. 13 The scope of the current review will focus on the electronic and chemical properties of well-characterized TMC surfaces. After briefly describing the preparation and characterization of TMC surfaces in section 2, we will systematically review the chemical properties of TMC surfaces in sections 37. The review will be concluded by discussion of correlating electronic properties with chemical activities in section 8 and future research directions in section 9. The results to be discussed in the current review include those published after 1996, as well as selected earlier publications related to the topics of this review. The readers should find more systematic and comprehensive discussions of results published before 1996 in earlier reviews.5,6,12,13
2. Characterization of Carbide Surfaces
2.1. Common Carbide Surface Structures
The groups 4 and 5 TMCs all form monocarbides (TiC, ZrC, HfC, VC, NbC, and TaC) with a face-centered-cubic (fcc) B1 crystal structure. 14 Similar to the NaCl structure, these carbides are characterized by two interpenetrating metal and carbon fcc lattices. The most commonly studied crystalline planes are the (100) and (111) surfaces. The (100) surface is characterized by the coexistence of the metal and carbon atoms. The (111) orientation has alternating layers of metal and carbon atoms, and the (111) surface can be terminated either by metal or by carbon. The structures of the metal- and carbon-terminated fcc(111) surfaces are illustrated in Figure 1a and b, respectively.
Figure 1 Surface structures of carbon- and metal-terminated TiC(111) and Mo2C(0001), which represent the most close-packed surfaces of TiC (fcc structure) and Mo2C (hcp structure), respectively. The smaller spheres represent carbon atoms, which reside either below (in parts a and c) or above (in parts b and d) the metal surfaces.
In comparison, group 6 metals (Cr, Mo, W) do not always produce stable monocarbides. The most commonly studied group 6 TMCs include Mo2C, W2C, and WC. In general, the structures of group 6 TMCs are much more complex than their groups 4 and 5 counterparts. For example, the β-Mo2C phase has an orthorhombic crystal structure, 15 with the (100) surface corresponding to the closest-packed surface that can be terminated by either Mo or C atoms. Because the arrangement of Mo is only slightly distorted from a hexagonal-closed packed (hcp) arrangement, the crystal structure of β-Mo2C can often be loosely described as an hcp structure with carbon atoms occupying the octahedral interstitial sites. Correspondingly, the closest-packed surface of β-Mo2C is often reported in the literature as the hcp(0001) surface. The structures of the Mo- and C-terminated β-Mo2C(0001) surfaces are illustrated in Figure 1c and d, respectively.
2.2. Preparation of Carbide Surfaces
Surface science studies have been primarily focused on three types of materials: bulk single crystal carbides, carbide-modified single crystal metal surfaces, and polycrystalline carbide thin films. There are advantages and disadvantages for using each type of materials. The main advantage for using bulk crystals is their well-ordered stoichiometric surfaces; the disadvantage is the scarcity of the crystal materials, especially for group 6 TMCs. The advantage for carbide-modified metal surfaces is the ability to control the carbon/metal stoichiometry and to directly compare with the parent metal surfaces; the disadvantage is the imperfect termination and defects. The advantage of studying thin films is the opportunity to address the so-called materials gap to correlate single crystals with more realistic polycrystalline materials; the disadvantage is the lack of general understanding of the surface properties.
The preparation of clean surfaces of bulk carbides typically involves the sputtering and annealing cycles that are commonly used for metal surfaces.12 It is important to point out that the surface structures of TMCs are often different from those of the bulk materials. For example, the contraction and relaxation in the first interlayer spacing often occur for the fcc(111) and fcc(100) carbide surfaces. In addition, the surface carbon/metal stoichiometries also depend on the annealing temperature. More detailed discussion about the preparation and characterization of bulk single-crystal TMCs can be found in a previous review.12 The preparation of carbide-modified surfaces is generally achieved by exposing the clean metal surfaces to unsaturated hydrocarbons, followed by annealing to temperatures higher than 1000 K.6 The annealing procedure is often required to drive the excess surface carbon into the interstitial sites. In most cases, well-ordered surface structures, as determined using low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), can only be obtained after annealing. The exposingannealing cycles are typically repeated several times to obtain the desirable carbon/metal stoichiometries and/or surface structures. The specific procedures for preparing carbide-modified surfaces, as well as the corresponding LEED patterns, have been described in detail in an earlier review6 and will not be discussed in the current review.
The preparation of polycrystalline thin films has been achieved in two ways: carburization of metal films with hydrocarbons 16 or physical vapor deposition (PVD) from a bulk carbide target. 17 For example, a β-Mo2C thin film was prepared by carburizing a Mo foil at high temperatures with a mixture of methane and hydrogen, followed by room-temperature passivation in a flow of 0.5% O2/He.16 X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements indicated that the foil was essentially pure β-Mo2C. In the PVD method, thin films of carbides were prepared by magnetron sputtering from carbide targets onto a flat substrate, such as glassy carbon or single-crystal sapphire. Thin films of W2C and WC were recently prepared by sputtering from a bulk WC target, and the desirable carbide phases were obtained by controlling the deposition temperature and postannealing conditions.17 XRD measurements confirmed the phase purity of W2C and WC films. Similar to the case of bulk carbide single crystals, the surfaces of the carbide films can be cleaned by repeating cycles of sputtering and annealing.
2.3. Common Characterization Techniques for Carbide Surfaces
The structural and electronic properties of carbide surfaces have been studied using a variety of experimental techniques and theoretical modeling. Table 1 summarizes the carbide surfaces that will be discussed in the current review. Table 1 also summarizes the experimental and theoretical techniques that have been utilized to characterize the electronic and structural properties of the corresponding surfaces. Discussion about the characterization of many other carbide surfaces, published before 1996, can be found in previous reviews.6,12 In this section we will use the characterization of several carbide surfaces as examples to describe some of the most commonly utilized surface techniques. We will focus primarily on the characterization of the structural and electronic properties, which will be frequently referred to in later sections in the discussion of chemical activities of the corresponding carbide surfaces.

2.3.1. Groups 4 and 5 Carbides
The TiC(100) surface has been examined using LEED 18,19 and theoretical calculations. 20 Tagawa and co-workers determined that the surface atomic structure of TiC(100) was relaxed, with the topmost C atoms displaced outward and the Ti atoms inward.18,19 Jansen and Hoffmann conducted a comprehensive study of the TiC(100) and (111) surfaces by using extended Hckel tight binding calculations.20 The TiC(111) surface has been studied with synchrotron-based, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), where the results showed the surface to be polar with the Ti layer on top. 21 Through local density of states (LDOS) calculations, Tan et al. showed that, at elevated temperatures (1900 K), the TiC(111) surface should always be Ti-terminated as a direct consequence of the different evaporation rates between C and Ti atoms. 22 As summarized by Johansson,12 photoemission spectroscopy (PES) measurements have revealed that the electronic structures of many fcc(111) surfaces were characterized by the existence of surface states near the Fermi level (EF). In contrast, the density of states around the EF was relatively small on the fcc(100) carbide surfaces.12 Such a difference in the surface states has been cited as the reason for the observations that the fcc(111) surface is generally more active than the fcc(100) of the same carbide. 23 Edamoto and co-workers have utilized angle-resolved and core-level photoemission spectroscopy (CLPES) to compare the surface electronic structures of the (111) surfaces of several groups 4 and 5 carbides, HfC(111), 24 ZrC(111),23,25,26 ZrC(100), 27 NbC(111), 28,29 and NbC(100). 30 For example, ARPES data revealed the presence of a surface state near the Fermi level on HfC(111). On the basis of the resonance photoemission measurements as well as additional polarization-dependent studies, the surface state was attributed to the 5d orbitals of the surface Hf atoms.24 These results agreed well with a previous investigation of the presence of the 3d states on TiC(111). 31 Additional measurements monitoring the effect of potassium25 and cesium 32 adsorption on ZrC(111), and sodium,29 potassium,28 and cesium 33 adsorption on NbC(111) also revealed the intrinsic differences between the electronic structures of the groups 4 and 5 TMC surfaces.
Perry and co-workers have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations on stoichiometric clusters to compare the electronic properties of TiC(100) and VC(100). 34 Clusters modeling the TiC(100) surface did not show the presence of occupied molecular orbitals with clear predominance of 3d character. Furthermore, the strong covalency between the C 2p and Ti 3d states could also limit the availability of these electrons for surface reactions. In contrast, using V9C9 clusters to model the VC(100) surface, these authors identified the occupation of predominantly metal 3d levels, leading to the equivalent of a d1 electron configuration.34 The frictional properties of TiC(100) and VC(100) were also compared with atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. 35 Perry et al. showed that the TiC(100) surface exhibited inherently lower friction than VC(100) by conducting measurements at various degrees of oxidation and humidity, as well as with several probe tips.35 These results again pointed out differences in the electronic properties between groups 4 and 5 TMC surfaces.
Several recent theoretical and experimental studies have compared the low-index carbide single crystals with nanocrystals and metcar structures. 36-41 First principles calculations on TiC(001) showed that the surface C atoms moved slightly outward and Ti atoms inward, 39,42 consistent with experimental observation for the TiC(100) surface.18,19 Rodriguez and co-workers recently determined that the structure of the T8C12 metcar consisted of metal atoms occupying the low-coordination inner positions and high-coordination outer positions, as well as the presence of six pairs of short CC bonds. The presence of the C2 groups increased the stability of the metcar T8C12 structure. In addition, the presence of these C2 groups also enhanced the chemical reactivity of the Ti atoms by weakening the TiC bonds.39
2.3.2. Group 6 Carbides
The Mo and W carbide surfaces have been studied using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), 43 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), 43-45 scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), 46,47 LEED,45,46 and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES).46 For example, studies of α-Mo2C(0001) revealed that the surface could be altered between Mo- and C-terminated simply by changing the annealing temperature.45 Otani and co-workers used ARPES to show that the valence band region of a C-terminated α-Mo2C(0001) surface consisted of Mo 4d, C 2s, and Mo 4dC 2p hybrid bands. 48 Gthelid and Janin combined the STM, AES, and LEED techniques to study the structure of WC(0001) as a function of surface composition.46 These authors reported a variety of LEED patterns, all of which were strongly dependent on the atomic C/W ratio at the surface.46 The interaction of Mo or W carbides with another metal has also been investigated to determine the underlying structural and electronic properties of the carbide surfaces. For example, an ab initio study involving the interface of Al(111) and WC(0001) has been reported by Siegel and co-workers. 49 It was determined that the ideal work of adhesion on the C-terminated WC(0001) surface was 2 J/m2 stronger than that on the W-terminated surface, confirming the effect of termination on the properties of the carbide surfaces. In another example, Campbell and co-workers have examined the adsorption energy of Pb on an ordered (1 × 1) Mo2C film on Mo(100). 50 AES and LEED studies confirmed that the carbide film contained one carbon per surface Mo(100) atom sitting in or near the fourfold hollow sites. The microcalorimetry measurements showed a large initial heat of Pb adsorption, which was consistent with Mo2C resembling a late transition metal chemically and/or electronically.50 Among the carbide-modified surfaces, the C/Mo(110) surface is one of the most thoroughly characterized.13,51-55 LEED studies have revealed a p(4 × 4) pattern after the C/Mo(110) surface was annealed to 1000 K or higher.51,54 AES measurements showed the C/Mo atomic ratio approaching 0.5, indicating a Mo2C stoichiometry for the surface carbide layer.51,53,54 The electronic properties of the C/Mo(110) surface have been characterized using two synchrotron-based spectroscopies, soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS)55 and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS).13,53,55 The SXPS results revealed that the density of states below the EF level was significantly different between C/Mo(110) and clean Mo(110), indicating an electronic modification upon the formation of carbides. NEXAFS has been utilized to determine the local bonding environment of carbon atoms, as well as the density of states above the EF level, of many groups 46 TMCs,13,56-60 including the C/Mo(110) surface. For example, on the basis of the polarization dependence of C K-edge features,55 NEXAFS results suggested that the C/Mo(110) surface was terminated by C atoms in a similar way as the C-terminated Mo2C surface shown earlier in Figure 1d. Results from recent DFT modeling were also consistent with the structural model of describing the C/Mo(110) surface as C-terminated Mo2C/Mo(110). 61 In the next five sections, we will systematically review the chemical activities of TMC surfaces toward different classes of inorganic and organic molecules. Table 2 provides of a summary of the reactions of molecules on different TMC surfaces, as well as the experimental and theoretical techniques that have been utilized to investigate each of the chemical systems. Results from some of the earlier publications (before 1996) are not included in Table 2 and can be found in a previous review.6 Table 2.

3. Reactions with Diatomic Molecules
3.1. Hydrogen
The adsorption of hydrogen and deuterium has been investigated on the (111) surfaces of several groups 4 and 5 single-crystal carbides, TiC(111), ZrC(111), HfC(111), NbC(111), and TaC(111). Several surface techniques have been employed, including impact-collision ion-scattering spectroscopy (ICISS),75,76 ARPES, 77-79 LEED,76 reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED),75 and high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). 80 In all of these studies, the dissociative adsorption of hydrogen was observed at room temperature. ARPES results revealed the presence of a hydrogen-induced surface state on TiC(111)21,79 and ZrC(111)78 that was not detected on NbC(111)77 and TaC(111),77 suggesting that hydrogen was bonded to different sites on the groups 4 and 5 TMC surfaces. Ion-scattering studies indicated that deuterium adsorbed onto the threefold hollow site on the third layer metal atoms of both HfC(111)76 and NbC(111).75 HREEL spectra of hydrogen on ZrC(111), HfC(111), and NbC(111) revealed the ν(metal-H) vibrational modes in the frequency range between 890 and 970 cm-1,80 consistent with the adsorption of atomic hydrogen on the twofold or threefold sites. These results correlated well with first principle calculations, which showed that hydrogen atoms preferentially occupied the ZrC(111) surface hollow sites in which the third layer Zr atoms were directly below the hydrogen.63 On the other hand, HREELS measurements for hydrogen adsorbed on TaC(111) showed an unusually high-frequency feature at 1680 cm-1,80 typically in the frequency range for atomic hydrogen on the terminal site. Overall, these studies indicate that hydrogen dissociates readily at room temperature on the groups 4 and 5 TMC surfaces. It appears that atomic hydrogen adsorbs in a similar environment on the three group 4 TMC surfaces, while the adsorption on the group 5 TaC(111) surface appears to be unique on the basis of the ARPES and HREELS measurements.
The reaction of hydrogen with carbide-modified group 6 surfaces, C/Mo(110)61 and C/W(111), 81 has been investigated using TPD. The main motivation for these studies was to determine the feasibility of using group 6 carbides as potential electrocatalysts for hydrogen fuel cells. Hydrogen adsorbed dissociatively on the C/Mo(110) and C/W(111) surfaces at liquid nitrogen temperature and recombined to desorb as H2 in a broad temperature range of 200400 K. Analysis of the TPD results as a function of hydrogen exposure indicated a second-order desorption kinetics for atomic hydrogen from C/Mo(110).61 More details about the theoretical modeling of the correlation between the electronic properties of C/Mo(110) and hydrogen binding energy will be discussed in section 8.
3.2. Oxygen
Oxygen adsorption has been extensively used as a prototype to demonstrate differences in the surface electronic structures of the (100) and (111) faces of groups 4 and 5 TMC surfaces. The reaction with oxygen often resulted in changes in the electronic states of TMC surfaces. For example, photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of oxygen adsorption on ZrC(100) 27,82 revealed that the formation of a ZrO-like layer altered the surface electronic structure, making the electronic properties of ZrOZrC(100) similar to those of ZrC(111). 23,83 Studies on oxygen-modified TiC(100) also indicated a similar increase of the density of states around the EF relative to the case of the unmodified surface. 84 Frantz and Didziulis reported XPS and HREELS results showing oxygen adsorbed dissociatively with preference for the carbon sites on TiC(100), eventually recombining with surface carbon to desorb as COx species at higher temperatures. 85 DFT modeling using (100) Ti9C9 clusters also confirmed the preference in the formation of CO over TiO surface bonds by over 50 kcal/mol.34 On VC(100), however, oxygen dissociated to form a metastable overlayer of VO species,85 again consistent with DFT studies using (100) V9C9 clusters.34 The difference in the adsorption sites of oxygen on these two (100) surfaces was attributed to the different electronic structures. For example, the highest occupied orbital in TiC is C 2p, leading to the bonding of oxygen on the carbon atom. In comparison, the one additional electron in the VC formula unit resides predominantly in a V 3d orbital, therefore favoring the formation of the VO bond.
The effect of adsorbed oxygen on the frictional properties of VC(100) was also examined by Merrill and Perry using AFM. 86 Upon saturation adsorption of an oxygen adlayer, the coefficient of friction for VC(100) was reduced by nearly 40%. The observed change in friction was attributed to the decrease in the density of the metal d electrons near the Fermi level when the VC(100) surface was modified by oxygen.86 STM has been employed to compare the clean and oxygen-modified surfaces of TiC(001) 87 and TiC(111). 88 Kuramochi et al. showed that a defect-free (1 × 1) TiC(001) surface was inert toward the dissociation of oxygen.87 When reconstructed to a (×) structure, however, the surface became highly active toward oxygen dissociation, with oxygen adsorbing onto the carbon vacancies created by the surface reconstruction.87 The interaction of oxygen with WC(0001) 89,90 and WC(1010) 91 has been investigated using several techniques. TPD studies following the adsorption of O2 on WC(0001) showed two recombinatory CO desorption peaks at 750 and 890 K.89 Freund et al. attributed the first CO peak to the removal of surface carbon and the second to the reaction between oxygen and carbon in the second and subsequent layers. Angular-resolved UPS (ARUPS) further revealed the existence of WO, WCxOy, and elemental W at low temperatures. Oxidation at 1300 K resulted in the formation of a thin WOx surface layer.89 Synchrotron-based CLPES investigations by Johansson and co-workers showed the W 4f components to be shifted and strongly attenuated upon relatively high oxygen exposures.90 HREELS and UPS studies following room-temperature exposure of oxygen on WC(1010) were consistent with molecular adsorption; however, the OO bond order was considerably reduced to a value between 1.05 and 1.25.91 The chemisorption of oxygen was studied on Mo- and C-terminated α-Mo2C(0001) surfaces. 48,92 St Clair et al. found that on both surfaces CO was the only gas-phase product detected following oxygen adsorption, with the dominant CO desorption peak appearing at 834 K.92 Quantitative analysis suggested that the reaction between adsorbed O and surface carbon to form CO was only a minority pathway (16%). The remaining 84% of the adsorbed oxygen diffused into the crystal bulk, which was consistent with studies of polycrystalline Mo2C powders. 92,93 Results from the above studies clearly indicate that carbide surfaces are generally very active toward the dissociation of oxygen. The resulting oxygen-modified TMCs, often referred to as oxycarbides in the catalysis literature, should have chemical properties that are different from those of unmodified TMCs. Several studies have aimed at investigating the modification effect of oxygen on the chemical properties of C/Ti(0001), 94 C/Mo(110),55 and C/W(111). 95 In these studies the carbide surfaces were exposed to O2 at different temperatures to create different oxycarbide surfaces, which were subsequently investigated to determine the modification effect of oxygen on the chemical properties of TMC surfaces.55,94,95 For example, Figure 2 shows the HREELS results highlighting the different adsorption behavior of O2 on C/Mo(110) at 600 and 900 K.55 The peak at 386 cm-1 was assigned to the ν(MoC) mode, and the rest of the vibrational features were (MoO) vibrational modes of atomic oxygen occupying different surface sites. The oxygen binding environment was different on the 600 and 900 K O/C/Mo(110) surfaces, as indicated by the different ν(MoO) frequencies on the two surfaces. For example, the HREEL spectrum of the 600 K O/C/Mo(110) surface strongly resembled that of the O/Mo(110) surface. As a consequence, the two O/C/Mo(110) surfaces were characterized by drastically different reactivities, with the 600 K O/C/Mo(110) surface being chemically inert and the 900 K surface remaining chemically active.55 Figure 2 HREEL spectra comparing various chemically modified Mo(110) surfaces.55 The C/Mo(110) surface was prepared by exposing clean Mo(110) to ethylene at 600 K followed by annealing to 1200 K to create the characteristic (4 × 4) LEED pattern. The 600 and 900 K O/C/Mo(110) surfaces were obtained after exposing the C/Mo(110) surface to 7 L of O2 at 600 and 900 K, respectively.
3.3. Carbon Monoxide
The chemisorption and decomposition of CO on TMC surfaces have been extensively investigated to determine the relative electron accepting and donating capability of the substrate, as well as to illustrate the changes in reactivity upon carbide modification. Previous theoretical studies by Jansen and Hoffmann revealed a significant reduction in the ability of the TiC(100) substrate to donate electrons into the 2π* antibonding orbitals of CO when compared with that of Ti(0001).20 Experimentally, the adsorption of CO on TiC(100) was studied by Didziulis et al. using TPD, HREELS, UPS, and XPS.99 The authors observed that a majority of the CO bonded weakly to the TiC(100) surface, as evidenced by a single desorption peak below 150 K. HREELS measurements did not show significant features attributable to CO adsorption until the spectra were taken with an ambient CO background. Heating to 180 K and above resulted in some CO decomposition, eventually leading to the formation of surface TiO species. On the basis of the UPS and XPS results, the authors concluded that the d2π* interaction was nonexistent between TiC(100) and CO, which was supported by DFT calculations showing the metal atoms of the TiC terrace sites to be d0 in character.34,99 DFT results suggested that CO bonding with the carbon end down was more favored on the metal sites, with the adsorption energy nearly all provided through σ-donation.34 The same study also compared the adsorption of CO on the TiC(111) surface, leading to the prediction that the adsorption energy of CO on TiC(111) would almost be twice that on TiC(100).34 The same authors also used the adsorption of CO as a probe to differentiate the electronic structures between VC and TiC.34 The electronic structure of VC is different from that of TiC in part because of an additional electron in its formula unit.99 Comparative studies showed that the heat of desorption of CO was higher on VC(100) than on TiC(100). CO desorbed on VC(100) at 200 K at low coverage and at 170 K for higher exposures. Low-temperature exposures of CO on VC(100) resulted in the detection of a ν(CO) mode at 2060 cm-1. The authors suggested that the lower CO stretching frequency observed on VC(100), as compared to 2120 cm-1 on TiC(100), was indicative of greater d2π* interaction. Additional photoemission measurements and DFT calculations also supported the conclusions that CO was bonded more strongly to VC(100) than to TiC(100), and that the surface metal atoms of VC behaved as d1 species.34 The interaction of CO with carbide-modified V(110) surfaces, with atomic C/V ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.4, has been examined by Chen and co-workers.100,101 On all C/V(110) surfaces, CO molecules bonded to the terminal sites via the carbon end. TPD data revealed that CO desorbed molecularly from the surface at temperatures above 200 K. These observations were significantly different from that on clean V(110), where CO adsorbed in the parallel and inclined configurations characteristic of CO on other early transition metal surfaces.102 Overall, the studies on the titanium and vanadium carbide surfaces agreed well with prior work suggesting that the formation of carbides reduced the degree of the interaction between the metal d band and the 2π* orbital of adsorbed CO.103 The adsorption of CO has also been employed to highlight the differences in the electronic structures of ZrC(100) and ZrC(111) surfaces.104 CO adsorbed dissociatively on ZrC(111) and on oxygen-modified ZrC(100) at room temperature with a sticking probability near one. In contrast, CO adsorption was not observed on unmodified ZrC(100).104 The difference in the surface reactivity toward CO was attributed to the participation of the electronic states around EF on ZrC(111) and oxidized ZrC(100); however, these surface states were not present on unmodified ZrC(100), leading to the weaker interaction of CO on ZrC(100).23,27,82,104 St. Clair et al. examined the interaction of CO on Mo-terminated and C-terminated α-Mo2C(0001) surfaces.92 Both surfaces exhibited similar activity toward CO, as indicated by the nearly identical molecular desorption temperature, decreasing from 440 to 345 K with increasing exposure. The only observable difference between the Mo- and C-terminated surfaces was the amount of CO uptake; the CO desorption area on the C-terminated surface was approximately 80% that on the Mo-terminated surface. Parallel UPS studies revealed an increase of 0.27 eV in the work function upon CO adsorption on α-Mo2C(0001) at 300 K, suggesting some charge transfer due to the d2π* back-bonding.92 Wang and co-workers studied the chemisorption of CO on a β-Mo2C foil with TPD and reflectance absorbance infrared spectroscopy (IRAS).16 The recombinatory desorption of CO was detected near 1200 K, in addition to molecular desorption between 325 and 360 K. The high-temperature peak saturated at a very low coverage of CO even as the intensity of the low-temperature peak continued to increase. IRAS experiments comparing CO adsorption on β-Mo2C and the oxygen-modified β-Mo2C showed a vibrational mode at 2069 cm-1 on both surfaces, though this feature appeared to be broader and less intense on the oxygen-modified surface. Furthermore, the preadsorption of oxygen also decreased the molecular desorption temperature of CO by approximately 50 K.16 The chemisorption of CO has also been studied on single-crystal WC(0001) using ARUPS.105,106 The perpendicularly adsorbed CO molecules induced two valence bands at 8.5 and 11.5 eV, which were assigned to the 5σ/1π and 4σ states, respectively. Heating to 293 K resulted in these two features disappearing from the spectrum. The ARUPS spectrum at this temperature did not resemble that of a clean surface, but rather that of an oxygen-covered surface. Further heating to 878 K recovered the clean surface spectrum due to the recombinatory desorption of CO from the surface. Additional TPD measurements confirmed the ARPES results. Specifically, the authors detected two low-temperature molecular desorption states at 200 and 250 K, followed by a stronger CO peak centered at 720 K.105 Brillo et al. also investigated the effect of preadsorbed oxygen on the adsorption of CO on WC(0001). At moderate oxygen coverages, CO chemisorption was essentially unaffected, as evident by the detection of the same 5σ/1π and 4σ ionization states. At higher oxygen coverages CO no longer adsorbed to the WC(0001) surface.105,106 Another important motivation for studying the interaction between CO and TMC surfaces is that the adsorption and desorption of CO play a critical role in the deactivation of electrocatalysts in hydrogen and methanol fuel cells.107,108 The current anodic electrocatalysts, Pt/Ru alloys, are susceptible to CO poisoning due to the adsorption of CO under the fuel cell operating temperature, which is typically between 353 and 373 K.109 Mo and W carbides have been suggested as a potential replacement for the Pt/Ru system, partially due to their higher tolerance to CO poisoning.9-11 A series of fundamental studies using CO as a probe molecule was carried out on carbide-modified W(111),110,111 W(110),110,112 and Mo(110)54 surfaces. On all three clean metal surfaces, CO readily decomposed; when heated to higher temperatures, the surface carbon and oxygen recombined to desorb as CO.54,110-112 Upon carbide modification, however, the decomposition activity decreased to <10% of the adsorbed CO, with an overwhelming majority desorbing at or below 350 K. The presence of preadsorbed oxygen on the carbide surfaces also resulted in a significant reduction of the CO desorption temperature. For example, on C/W(111), CO desorbed at 330 and 355 K; with oxygen on the surface, however, CO desorbed at temperatures as low as 242 K.110,111 The ability to desorb CO at lower temperatures would most likely translate into more resistance against CO poisoning. As compared in Table 3, the CO desorption temperatures on the carbide surfaces are significantly lower than those from the closed-packed Pt(111) 113,114 and Ru(0001) 115,116 surfaces, suggesting the possibility of carbides being more tolerant to CO poisoning in the temperature range 353373 K.Table 3.

3.4. Nitric Oxide
As a major component of the undesired NOx emission, the dissociation of NO has been the focus of several investigations to evaluate the potential of using carbides as an alternative De-NOx catalyst. The reaction of NO has been investigated on carbide-modified W(110),120 W(111),120,121 and Mo/W(111),120 single-crystal WC(0001),105,106 and polycrystalline β-Mo2C films.16 NO molecules adsorbed predominantly in an upright geometry on WC(0001) at 105 K, with some NO already dissociating at this temperature.105,106 By 160 K, all adsorbed NO decomposed, and no low-temperature molecular desorption was detected even at near saturation coverage. Using ARUPS, Freund and co-workers observed features characteristic of an oxygen-covered surface when the overlayer was heated to above 500 K. TPD studies showed very little or no recombinatory NO desorption; however, atomic oxygen did react with surface carbon to desorb as CO at 720 and 860 K. Heating to above 900 K resulted in the recombinatory desorption of N2.105 Wang et al. examined the chemisorption of NO on a β-Mo2C film using TPD and IRAS.16 Low-temperature N2O and N2 desorption features were observed, and recombinatory N2 desorption peaks were recorded at 850 and 1100 K. In addition to a CO desorption feature at 1050 K, the authors also observed a weak CO signal at 350 K. Overall, their TPD results showed that NO underwent extensive decomposition and that the dissociation occurred for all exposures of NO up to saturation. IRAS measurements suggested that most of the NO molecules were strongly bonded to on-top sites and that some low-temperature dissociation of NO led to the availability of additional binding sites.16 Zhang and co-workers reported comparative studies of NO decomposition on carbide-modified W(111) and W(110) using TPD, HREELS, and SXPS.120,12115NO was used in the TPD experiments to differentiate 15N2 (mass 30 amu) and CO (mass 28 amu) products. Both C/W(111) and C/W(110) readily decomposed NO. On C/W(111), low-temperature N2O and N2 desorption states were detected at 167 K, with an additional high-temperature N2 peak at 912 K. Coincidentally, CO desorption resulting from the reaction between oxygen and surface carbon was observed at the same temperature as N2 desorption. The comparative investigation of the dissociation of NO on the open-structured C/W(111) and closed-packed C/W(110) surfaces also revealed the structure-dependent activity and product selectivity. The C/W(111) surface was more active toward NO decomposition and more selective toward the formation of the desirable De-NOx product (N2) than C/W(110). At saturation NO exposure, the selectivity toward N2 was 87% on the C/W(111) surface.121 The C/W(110) surface, on the other hand, showed a selectivity of 50% toward N2 and N2O.120 Zhang et al. also demonstrated that oxygen modification on C/W(111) did not reduce either the decomposition activity toward NO or the high selectivity toward N2.121 In addition, alternating cycles of NO/hydrocarbon treatments successfully regenerated an active C/W(111) surface toward NO decomposition.121 As an extension of their studies on C/W(111), Zhang and co-workers also reported the decomposition of NO on carbide-modified Mo surfaces, where Mo was epitaxially grown on the W(111) substrate through physical vapor deposition.120 In general, the interaction between NO and C/Mo/W(111) was similar to that on C/W(111) in terms of both dissociation activity and product selectivity, suggesting that the product selectivity of NO may be more sensitive to the substrate structure than to the identity of the parent metals.120
4. Reactions with Hydrocarbon Molecules
Hydrocarbons are the most frequently used probe molecules for studying the chemical properties of TMC surfaces. In particular, because the reaction pathways of hydrocarbons on Pt-group metal surfaces have been well established, the studies of carefully chosen hydrocarbon molecules provide insights into the presence or absence of Pt-like properties on the TMC surfaces. For example, Figure 3 shows several reaction pathways that are characteristic of the Pt(111) surface, including the conversion of ethylene to ethylidyne, the selective activation of the α-CH bond of cis- and trans-2-butene to 2-butyne, and the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene and cyclohexadiene to benzene. As described below, these probe reactions have been studied on many TMC surfaces to determine whether they possessed the Pt-like chemical properties.

4.1. Linear Hydrocarbons4.1.1. C1 and C2 Molecules
The adsorption and decomposition of ethylene have been the focus of several experimental and theoretical investigations. Theoretical modeling of adsorbed ethylene on transition metals revealed that, for metals on the left side of the Periodic Table, a covalent bond was expected between ethylene and the metal.123 On these early transition metal surfaces, the π bond of ethylene was predicted to be effectively broken, leading to the formation of surface complexes containing a CC single bond. This was in contrast to the case predicted for transition metals on the right side of the Periodic Table, where the bonding was more of a compromise between the covalent and donationback-donation bonding configurations. Additional calculations indicated that the CC bond order of adsorbed ethylene on late transition metals was likely to be between that of a double bond and that of a single bond.123 Experimental studies generally confirmed the theoretical predictions of ethylene reactivity on various transition metal surfaces. On early transition metals, adsorbed ethylene underwent complete decomposition to yield atomic carbon and gas-phase hydrogen. In contrast, the reaction of ethylene often produced a stable ethylidyne (CCH3) intermediate on the closed-packed surfaces of the Pt-group metals prior to complete dissociation at higher temperatures.124 Because the ethylidyne intermediate is observed almost exclusively on Pt-group metal surfaces, the presence or absence of this surface species can be used to compare the similarities or differences between TMC and Pt surfaces.
Comparative investigations of the interaction of ethylene on clean and carbide-modified V(110),101 Mo(100),125 Mo(110),126 W(100),127 W(111),128 W(110),128 and Ti(0001)94 surfaces have been reported. TPD measurements on these surfaces showed two similarities: (1) ethylene decomposed to produce atomic carbon and gas-phase hydrogen, and (2) the decomposition activity of the carbide surfaces toward ethylene was less than that of the clean surface, although the reduction in activity varies substantially from substrate to substrate. In addition to TPD experiments, HREELS studies have been instrumental in revealing the decomposition pathways of ethylene on the carbide surfaces. For example, Figure 4 compares the vibrational spectra of the surface intermediates after the reaction of ethylene on clean Ti(0001) and C/Ti(0001).94 On the basis of comparisons with the existing literature of ethylene on other transition metal surfaces, the spectrum on the Ti(0001) surface can be readily assigned to di-σ bonded ethylene as follows:129 ν(TiC) at 487 cm-1, ω(CH2) at 988 cm-1, ν(CC) at 1170 cm-1, δ(CH2) at 1394 cm-1, and ν(CH2) at 2916 cm-1. In contrast, the 300 K spectrum of ethylene on C/Ti(0001) is significantly different from that on clean Ti(0001), particularly in the onset of doublet features in the δ(CH) and ν(CH) regions. As summarized in Table 4, all the vibrational modes on C/Ti(0001) can be assigned to the ethylidyne intermediate,126,129 including the ρ(CH3) mode at 981 cm-1, the δs(CH3) and δas(CH3) modes at 1373 and 1454 cm-1, respectively, the ν(CC) mode at 1150 cm-1, and the ν(CH3) modes at 2882 and 2943 cm-1.

The formation of the CCH3 intermediate was also reported for several other closed-packed carbide-modified surfaces, including C/V(110),101 C/Mo(110),126 and C/W(110).128 The characteristic vibrational frequencies of the ethylidyne intermediate on these surfaces are compared in Table 4. It is important to point out that the ethylidyne intermediate is not detected on the non-closed-packed substrates, such as C/Mo(100),125 C/W(100),127 and C/W(111).128 This observation is consistent with studies of ethylene on Pt-group metals, where the formation of ethylidyne is typically detected only on the closed-packed surfaces.124 Although the ethylidyne intermediate is detected on both closed-packed TMC and Pt-group metal surfaces, there is a significant difference in the thermal stability. While ethylidyne species remain stable up to 400 K or higher on most Pt-group metal surfaces,124 they start to decompose at 300 K or lower on carbide-modified surfaces.94,101,126,128 Another noticeable difference is in the adsorption configuration of ethylidyne on the two types of surfaces. As compared in Figure 4, the detection of both the symmetric and asymmetric CH3 deformation and stretching modes suggested that ethylidyne was adsorbed with the CC bond in an inclined configuration with respect to the C/Ti(0001) surface; this was also consistent with the lack of angular dependence in the on- and off-specular HREELS measurements.94 In contrast, the ethylidyne on Pt(111) showed only those vibrational modes with dynamic dipoles parallel to the CC bond, consistent with ethylidyne being adsorbed with the CC bond perpendicular to the Pt(111) surface.129 It is very likely that the different thermal stability of ethylidyne is related to the different adsorption configuration, with the inclined ethylidyne being more susceptible to reactions with the surface and therefore starting to decompose at lower temperatures. Overall, the detection of ethylidyne suggests that the formation of carbide on early transition metals leads to the onset of the Pt-like properties. However, the differences in the thermal stability and adsorption orientation of ethylidyne also reveal that the chemical properties of the two types of surfaces are not identical. Similar conclusions can be drawn from the reactions of other probe molecules described later.
Acetylene is another C2 molecule commonly used to probe the reactivity of carbide surfaces. Studies have been conducted on carbide-modified W(211)130 to explore the possible cyclotrimerization of acetylene to benzene, which has been observed on Pd(111) 131-133 and Cu(110). 134,135 The use of the W(211) substrate also provided an example of carbide modification on a surface with highly corrugated structures. On both W(211) and C/W(211), acetylene decomposed to surface carbon and gas-phase hydrogen.130 TPD results showed that, upon carbide modification, the hydrogen desorption feature shifted to higher temperatures and broadened significantly. Vibrational studies showed that acetylene interacted strongly with clean W(211) upon adsorption at 100 K to produce a variety of C2Hy intermediates, which decomposed completely by 700 K. On the other hand, acetylene remained intact and bonded to the C/W(211) surface in the σ-bonded configuration at 100 K. Heating the overlayer to higher temperatures resulted in the formation of stable intermediates with CH2 or CH3 groups, and the CH vibrations remained visible even at 700 K. This comparative study indicated that the surface reactivity of W(211) was significantly altered by the presence of interstitial carbon. In addition, the TPD and HREELS results did not show any evidence of acetylene cyclotrimerization on C/W(211).130 Solymosi and co-workers utilized halogenated hydrocarbons, such as CH3I, 136 CH2I2, 137 and C2H5I,137 to study the reaction of CxHy species on a Mo2C/Mo(111) surface. Compared to the Pt-group metals, 138,139 the Mo2C/Mo(111) surface was less reactive toward CI bond scission. Once the CH2 species were formed following the dissociation of CH2I2, they underwent either self-hydrogenation to form methane or coupling to form ethylene on Mo2C/Mo(111).137 C2H5I adsorbed molecularly on Mo2C/Mo(111) at 100 K, with the CI bond dissociating at temperatures above 150 K. Both gas-phase ethylene and ethane were detected from the surface reaction of adsorbed C2H5 species. The authors also reported that no C4 or C1 products were detected from the coupling of C2H5 or cleaving of the CC bond. Additional vibrational spectra obtained for CH2I2 and C2H5I on the Mo2C/Mo(111) surface were consistent with the presence of di-σ bonded ethylene at low temperatures and ethylidyne at higher temperatures.137 Lastly, TPD results following the reaction of CH3I on Mo2C/Mo(111) showed that methane, ethylene, and hydrogen were the gas-phase products.136
4.1.2. C3 and C4 Molecules
Attempts to understand the activation of CH bonds of n-butane have been carried out on C/V(110) 140 and C/Mo(110).58 Although n-butane underwent reversible adsorption on clean V(110), the dissociation of n-butane was detected on the C/V(110) surface on the basis of the detection of the H2 product in the TPD measurements. In contrast, the C/Mo(110) surface was essentially inert toward the dissociation of n-butane. The different activity of C/V(110) and C/Mo(100) toward n-butane was one of the first examples that clearly demonstrated that the reactivity of the carbide surfaces depended on the parent metals. In addition, the activation of the CH bonds of n-butane on C/V(110) suggested that vanadium carbides might be a selective dehydrogenation catalyst, which was confirmed in the dehydrogenation of n-butane on polycrystalline VC powder catalysts. 141 Reactions of 1-butene and isobutene on clean and carbide-modified Mo(110) have been investigated using HREELS. 142 On clean Mo(110), isobutene dehydrogenated to produce CxHy fragments. In contrast, the reaction pathway of isobutene on C/Mo(110) led to the formation of the isobutylidyne intermediate, which resembled that observed on Pt(111) 143 and Ru(0001). 144 Further heating resulted in CC bond scission of the isobutylidyne species to form surface methyl groups.142 Results on the activation sequence of CH and CC bonds of isobutene suggested that C/Mo(110) may be better suited for hydrogenolysis reactions because of its ability to selectively cleave the CC bonds. Similar conclusions were derived on the basis of the reaction mechanisms of 1-butene on C/Mo(110).142 As depicted earlier in Figure 3, the selective activation of the α-CH bonds of 2-butenes is a characteristic surface reaction on Pt(111).143 Vibrational studies monitoring the reaction pathways of cis- and trans-2-butenes on Mo(110) and C/Mo(110) were used as probe reactions to study the potential Pt-like activity. 145 The clean Mo(110) surface was nonselective toward the dissociation of the α- and β-CH bonds, in particular in the dissociation of the trans-2-butene. In contrast, the C/Mo(110) surface led to the selective α(CH) bond cleavage for both 2-butenes to produce 2-butyne. This study provided another important example of converting the activity of Mo(110) to Pt-like via the formation of surface carbide.145 The adsorption and surface reactions of propyl iodide (C3H7I) 146 and allyl iodide (C3H5I) 147 on Mo2C/Mo(100) surfaces have been investigated by Solymosi et al. using TPD, XPS, and HREELS. After the scission of the CI bond, C3H7 fragments underwent predominantly dehydrogenation and hydrogenation at 300 K to produce gas-phase propene and propane, respectively.146 At higher temperatures, hexane and hexene products, resulting from coupling reactions, were also detected in TPD measurements. HREELS analysis of the C3H7I/Mo2C/Mo(100) overlayer suggested the formation of di-σ bonded propylene at 200 K, which then converted to propylidyne at 300 K.146 Studies of allyl iodide on Mo2C/Mo(100) led to similar conclusions. Allyl iodide also resulted in the production of gas-phase propene and propane, as well as the coupling products, hexane and hexadiene.147 One significant difference between the chemistry of C3H7I and C3H5I was that the coupling products from the C3H5 desorbed before the hydrogenated products (propene and propane), whereas the coupling products of C3H7 desorbed after propene and propane.146,147
4.2. Cyclic Hydrocarbons
The selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to produce gas-phase benzene is another probe reaction often used to demonstrate the similarities in the surface reactivity between carbide and Pt-group metal surfaces. For example, on Pt(111), the only desorption products detected following the reaction of cyclohexene adsorption were H2 and benzene. 148,149 Vibrational studies have revealed that adsorbed cyclohexene molecules were completely converted to adsorbed benzene on Pt(111) at 300 K. 148-150 Although the selectivity for converting cyclohexene to surface benzene was nearly 100% at 300 K, a significant fraction of surface benzene underwent subsequent thermal dissociation instead of desorbing to the gas-phase. Rodriguez and Campbell reported that the selectivity toward the production of gas-phase benzene depended on the initial surface coverage of cyclohexene on Pt(111). 151 Comparative HREELS and TPD studies of cyclohexene on clean and carbide-modified Mo(110) surfaces 152,153 showed that the formation of carbide significantly enhanced the dehydrogenation selectivity. For example, on clean Mo(110), cyclohexene adsorbed irreversibly and underwent complete decomposition without producing surface or gas-phase benzene. On C/Mo(110), however, cyclohexene primarily underwent partial dehydrogenation, with a 70% selectivity toward the production of gas-phase benzene. Moreover, HREELS measurements on C/Mo(110) did not detect benzene as a surface intermediate, indicating that the evolution of gas-phase benzene was a reaction-limited process152,153 instead of the desorption-limited process on Pt(111).148-151 The difference in the desorption temperature of the benzene product is illustrated in Figure 4, which compares the TPD spectra of benzene from the dehydrogenation of cyclohexene on Pt(111) and on several carbide-modified surfaces.
As compared in Figure 5, the selective dehydrogenation of cyclohexene was also observed on other carbide-modified surfaces, including C/Ti(0001),94 C/V(110), 154 and C/W(111). 155 Similar to the case observed on clean Mo(110), benzene is not produced on the clean surfaces of Ti(0001), V(110), or W(111). The formation of carbide on these surfaces introduced the dehydrogenation reaction pathway, resulting in the production of gas-phase benzene. Similar to the case on C/Mo(110), corresponding HREELS measurements did not detect the surface benzene intermediate on other carbide-modified surfaces,94,154,155 indicating that the desorption of benzene is also a reaction-limited process. It is also interesting to point out that the desorption temperature of the benzene product from the four carbide-modified surfaces is in the range 255330 K, significantly lower than the desorption temperature from Pt(111). The activity and selectivity to gas-phase benzene on the carbide-modified surfaces are summarized in Table 5. In brief, the values presented in Table 5 were derived by first correlating the carbon signal from AES to the hydrogen desorption peak area from TPD on the clean metal surfaces, on which only the complete decomposition of cyclohexene was observed (m·c-C6H10  6m·C + 5m·H2). By comparing the H2 desorption peak area on carbide surfaces relative to the clean surface, one can then obtain the percentage of hydrogen desorption attributable to benzene formation (n·c-C6H10  n·C6H6 + 2n·H2). Lastly, the summary in Table 5 does not include reversible molecular desorption as a reaction pathway.
Figure 5 TPD spectra of benzene (mass 78) obtained following saturation exposures of cyclohexene (c-C6H10) on C/Ti(0001),94 C/V(110),154 C/Mo(110),152 C/W(111),155 and Pt(111).150 A linear heating rate of 3 K/s was used in all TPD experiments.
