1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that understanding these structures can guide the design of more effective catalysts through first principles on model surfaces.
