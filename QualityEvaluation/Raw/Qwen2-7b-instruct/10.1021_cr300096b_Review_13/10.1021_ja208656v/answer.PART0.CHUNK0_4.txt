The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, significantly contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This correlation implies that by understanding and modeling these surfaces, one can design more efficient catalysts using first principles. The stability of these structures affects the activity and selectivity of electrocatalysts, making them crucial factors in the development of advanced catalysts for hydrogen production.
