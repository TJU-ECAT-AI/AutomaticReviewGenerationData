[1] "The monolayer Ni/WC and Ni/Pt surfaces would most likely have similar activities toward the surface reaction of ethanol, as confirmed experimentally below."
[2] "General similarities are observed in the reaction pathways of ethanol on monolayer Ni/Pt and Ni/WC, demonstrating the feasibility to replace Pt with WC and to use monolayer Ni/WC as active and less expensive reforming catalysts."
[3] "The Ni/Pt polycrystalline surface shows similar reaction pathways to those observed on single crystal Ni/Pt(111), demonstrating general similarities between model and more complex surfaces for the reforming reaction of ethanol."

The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by providing a basis for understanding how the electronic interactions and surface strain affect catalytic activity. This correlation allows for the prediction and design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. The implications of this correlation are significant, as it enables researchers to create catalysts that mimic the behavior of complex structures on a simpler, more manageable scale, potentially leading to more efficient and cost-effective catalysts for industrial processes.
