The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by enhancing the activity and selectivity of catalysts. This correlation allows for the design of more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces. For instance, the Ni/Pt bimetallic catalyst on γ-Al2O3 shows increased turnover frequencies for aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to Pt/γ-Al2O3 at similar conditions. Additionally, the surface Ni monolayer on tungsten monocarbide (WC) does not undergo thermally induced diffusion at temperatures up to 800 K, providing a stable platform for reforming reactions. The monolayer Ni/WC system, being Pt-free, represents a promising catalyst that is selective for the reforming of oxygenates, further emphasizing the importance of bimetallic structures in enhancing catalytic performance.

特定双金属结构，特别是Pt-3d系统中的亚表面3d原子，通过增强催化剂的活性和选择性，促进了模型表面与支持催化剂在氢化反应中的强相关性。这种相关性允许使用模型表面的原理解设计更有效的催化剂。例如，Ni/Pt双金属催化剂在γ-Al2O3上的转化频率在类似条件下对乙二醇的水相重整显示增加。此外，WC上的表面Ni单层在800K以下温度下不会发生热诱导扩散，为重整反应提供了稳定的平台。Ni/WC单层系统作为无Pt的催化剂，对于氧代物的重整具有选择性，进一步强调了双金属结构在增强催化性能中的重要性。
