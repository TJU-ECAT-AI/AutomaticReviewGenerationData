1. Surface science studies alongside investigations using supported catalysts showed that the Ni/Pt bimetallic catalyst, when supported on γ-Al2O3, exhibited increased turnover frequencies for the aqueous phase reforming of ethylene glycol compared to a Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst under similar conditions.

2. A recent study reported that the surface monolayer of Ni did not experience thermally induced diffusion up to temperatures of 800 K.

3. The combination of WC's properties, which includes its Pt-like characteristics in heterogeneous and electrochemical reactions, and its effectiveness as a diffusion barrier, suggests that monolayer Ni on WC could be a more thermally stable and cost-effective alternative to Ni/Pt for oxygenate reforming processes.

4. The dominant reaction pathway for ethanol on an unmodified WC surface involves the production of ethylene. This indicates that most of the surface sites are less reactive towards cleaving the carbon-carbon bond but are active in the scission of carbon-oxygen and carbon-hydrogen bonds.

5. Observations of similar reaction pathways for ethanol on both monolayer Ni/Pt and Ni/WC surfaces demonstrate the potential feasibility of replacing Pt with WC, and the use of monolayer Ni/WC as an active and less expensive catalyst for oxygenate reforming.

1. 表面科学研究与使用支持催化剂的调查相结合，表明Ni/Pt双金属催化剂在γ-Al2O3上的转台频率高于相似条件下Pt/γ-Al2O3催化剂的水相重整乙二醇。

2. 最近的一项研究报道，在800 K温度下，表面单层Ni没有经历热诱导扩散。

3. WC的特性组合，包括其在异质和电化学反应中的Pt样性质以及作为扩散屏障的有效性，表明在WC上使用单层Ni可能是更稳定且成本更低的选择，用于氧气化物重整过程。

4. 未经修改的WC表面的主要反应途径涉及乙醇的生产。这表明大部分表面位点对碳-碳键的断裂活性较低，但对碳-氧和碳-氢键的断裂活性较高。

5. 对于单层Ni/Pt和Ni/WC表面的乙醇反应途径的相似观察表明，用WC替换Pt的可行性，以及单层Ni/WC作为氧气化物重整过程活性且成本较低催化剂的潜在应用。
