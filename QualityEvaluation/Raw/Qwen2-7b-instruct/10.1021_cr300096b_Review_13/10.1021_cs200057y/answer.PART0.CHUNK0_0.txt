1. The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contributes to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions by ensuring that the reaction pathways and intermediates are comparable across different surface types. This allows for the transfer of knowledge from model surfaces to practical catalysts, facilitating the design of more effective catalysts through first principles on model surfaces.

2. The Ni/WC system is proposed as a promising catalyst that replaces Pt, offering the potential for Pt-free reforming of oxygenates, which could lead to more selective and cost-effective processes.

3. The similarities in the reaction pathways of ethanol on monolayer Ni/Pt and Ni/WC surfaces demonstrate that Pt can be replaced by WC while maintaining or enhancing the reforming activity. This finding supports the feasibility of using monolayer Ni/WC as a less expensive and efficient reforming catalyst compared to Ni/Pt.

1. Pt-3d系统的特定双金属结构的热力学稳定性，特别是具有亚表面3d原子的Pt-3d系统，通过确保反应路径和中间体在不同表面类型之间具有可比性，促进了模型表面与支持催化剂之间氢化反应的强相关性。这使得从模型表面到实用催化剂的设计成为可能，通过基于原理的第一原则对模型表面进行设计，从而促进更有效的催化剂设计。

2. 提出了Ni/WC系统作为有前景的催化剂，可以替代Pt，提供无Pt的氧原分解可能性，这可能导致更选择性和成本效益更高的过程。

3. 酒精在单层Ni/Pt和Ni/WC表面上的反应路径的相似性表明，Pt可以通过WC被取代，同时保持或增强重整活性。这一发现支持使用单层Ni/WC作为成本更低且效率更高的重整催化剂的可行性，与Ni/Pt相比。
