How does the thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, particularly in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, contribute to the strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions, and what are the implications of this correlation for designing more effective catalysts using first principles on model surfaces?
The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong correlation between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This stability ensures that the properties observed on the model surfaces closely mirror those of the actual catalysts when applied in practical scenarios. Consequently, this correlation facilitates the design of more effective catalysts through computational methods and first principles approaches on model surfaces, enabling researchers to predict and optimize catalyst performance before physical synthesis and testing, thus saving time and resources.
