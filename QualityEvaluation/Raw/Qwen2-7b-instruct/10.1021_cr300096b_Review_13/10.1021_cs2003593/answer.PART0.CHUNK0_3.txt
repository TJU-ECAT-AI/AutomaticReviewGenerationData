The thermodynamic stability of specific bimetallic structures, especially in Pt-3d systems with subsurface 3d atoms, plays a crucial role in establishing a strong connection between model surfaces and supported catalysts in hydrogenation reactions. This connection allows for a better understanding of how these structures influence reaction kinetics and selectivity. The implications of this correlation are significant, as it suggests that by studying model surfaces through kinetic modeling and computational methods, one can predict and design more effective catalysts for specific applications, such as ethylene glycol decomposition. This approach leverages first principles on model surfaces to optimize catalyst performance, potentially leading to more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.
