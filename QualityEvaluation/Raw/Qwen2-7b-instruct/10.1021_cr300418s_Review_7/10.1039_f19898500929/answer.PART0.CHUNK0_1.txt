[1] "CO adsorption at room temperature on the dehydroxylated CeO, surface shows the formation of four adsorbed species, linearly adsorbed CO, unidentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species."
[2] "The bidentate carbonate species can be converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, especially at high temperature."
[3] "Adsorbed CO, produces two carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species which are the same as those from adsorbed CO and bridged carbonate species."
[4] "Dehydroxylated CeO, can be partially reduced at room temperature by CO."
[5] "Surface OH groups prohibit CO adsorption. This is interpreted as indicating that there are no active sites for CO coordination."

1. CO adsorption at room temperature on the dehydroxylated CeO, surface forms linearly adsorbed CO, unidentate carbonate, bidentate carbonate, and inorganic carboxylate species.
2. Bidentate carbonate species can be converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species at high temperatures.
3. Adsorbed CO, produces two carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species identical to those from adsorbed CO and bridged carbonate species.
4. Room temperature reduction of dehydroxylated CeO, by CO is possible.
5. Surface OH groups prevent CO adsorption, suggesting lack of active sites for CO coordination.

1. 在去羟基化的CeO,表面，室温下的CO吸附形成了线性吸附的CO、单齿碳酸盐、双齿碳酸盐和无机羧酸盐四种吸附物种。
2. 双齿碳酸盐物种在高温下可以转化为单齿碳酸盐和无机羧酸盐物种。
3. 吸附的CO,产生与吸附的CO和桥接碳酸盐物种相同的两种碳酸盐和无机羧酸盐物种。
4. 可以通过CO在室温下部分还原去羟基化的CeO,。
5. 表面羟基团阻止了CO吸附，这表明没有活性位点用于CO协调。
