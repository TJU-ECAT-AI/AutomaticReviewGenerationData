The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. These vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption and activation of reactants, facilitating the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies a more active and more oxidizing surface, facilitating the oxidation of reactants. This mechanism allows for the efficient transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactants, driving the chemical reactions forward.

[1] "The formation of carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species from CO adsorption indicates that CO is oxidized by surface oxygen species; in other words, the surface of CeO, is partially reduced by CO."
[2] "CO oxidation on CeO, above 473 K has been investigated by Breysse et al.20*2r Their results confirmed the participation of lattice oxide ions during the reaction. A mechanism was proposed involving cyclic reduction/oxidation of the surface to explain CO oxidation on CeO,"
[3] "It is expected that CO reacts with some oxides to form carbonate species at high temperatures, but it seems impossible that the phenomenon occurs at room temperature."
[4] "The results on CeO, are not general for all oxides, and imply that the CeO, surface might possess either special adsorption sites or very active oxygen species, or both."
[5] "It is not plausible to extract lattice oxygen, especially at room temperature. It may be possible that the lattice oxide ions migrate to the surface to compensate for the surface oxygen vacancies created by CO reduction with increasing temperature; as a result, the surface carbonate and carboxylate species are enhanced at elevated temperatures, as shown fig. 3 and 4."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of an oxide catalyst. These oxygen vacancies are crucial in the oxidation process as they provide active sites for reactants to adsorb and undergo chemical transformations. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant as it determines the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and better oxidizing capability.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by facilitating the adsorption of reactants onto the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies, which are energetically favorable, act as active sites for these adsorbates. The reactants then undergo chemical transformations, leading to the desired product. The mechanism involves cyclic reduction and oxidation of the surface, allowing for the efficient use of oxygen and the acceleration of the reaction.

3. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism explains the oxidation of CO on CeO, at temperatures above 473 K. The reaction involves the participation of lattice oxide ions, which are part of the crystal structure of the oxide. A proposed mechanism includes the cyclic reduction and oxidation of the surface, which is essential for the oxidation of CO. 

4. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is not universally applicable to all oxides. The mechanism's applicability to CeO, specifically, suggests that the surface of CeO, possesses unique properties, such as special adsorption sites or very active oxygen species, enabling the oxidation of CO at room temperature.

5. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism on CeO, at room temperature involves the surface oxygen species and part of the capping oxygen ions. The surface oxygen species and capping oxygen ions are necessary for the formation of carbonate and carboxylate species. However, the presence of surface-active sites that can activate CO to form these species plays a more significant role in the mechanism's operation at room temperature. The surface-active sites likely enable the oxidation of CO even without the formation of oxygen vacancies.

1. 马斯-范克雷文机制涉及氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位（Ov）的形成。这些氧空位在氧化过程中至关重要，因为它们为反应物提供活性位点进行化学转化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，可能带来更高的催化活性和更好的氧化能力。

2. 马斯-范克雷文机制通过促进反应物在氧化物表面的吸附来运作。氧空位是表面能态，易于形成，作为这些吸附剂的活性位点。随后，反应物发生化学变化，导致所需产物的生成。机制包括表面的周期性还原和氧化，这允许有效利用氧气并加速反应。

3. 马斯-范克雷文机制解释了在473 K以上的温度下CO在CeO,上的氧化。该反应涉及晶格氧离子的参与，这些离子是氧化物晶体结构的一部分。提出的机制包括表面的周期性还原和氧化，这是CO氧化的关键。

4. 马斯-范克雷文机制不适用于所有氧化物。该机制对于CeO,的具体适用性表明，CeO,表面可能具有独特的特性，如特殊吸附位点或非常活跃的氧物种，使CO在室温下被氧化成为可能。

5. 在室温下，马斯-范克雷文机制在CeO,上涉及表面氧物种和部分覆层氧离子。表面氧物种和覆层氧离子对于形成碳酸盐和羧酸盐物种是必要的。然而，在室温下操作时，激活CO以形成这些物种的表面活性位点起着更重要的作用。这些表面活性位点可能使CO在无需形成氧空位的情况下被氧化成为可能。
