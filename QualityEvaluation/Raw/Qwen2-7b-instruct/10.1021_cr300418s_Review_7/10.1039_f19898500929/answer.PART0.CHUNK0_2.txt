[1] "Dehydroxylated CeO, can be partially reduced at room temperature by CO."
[2] "The bidentate carbonate species can be converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, especially at high temperature."
[3] "Adsorbed CO, produces two carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species which are the same as those from adsorbed CO and bridged carbonate species."
[4] "Surface OH groups prohibit CO adsorption. This is interpreted as indicating that there are no active sites for CO coordination."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. These vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption and activation of reactants, facilitating the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位（ΔEv）的操作。这些空位作为反应物吸附和活化的活性位点，促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv值表示氧空位更容易形成，导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。
