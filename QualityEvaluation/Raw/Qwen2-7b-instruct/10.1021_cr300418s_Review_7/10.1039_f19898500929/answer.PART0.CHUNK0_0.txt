[1] "Although CO adsorbed on metal oxides has been extensively studied by infrared spectroscopy,2. infrared-spectroscopic studies of CO adsorption on cerium oxide have not been carried out in detail until now."
[2] "In this paper i.r. spectra of adsorbed CO on cerium oxide are displayed. In order to assign those bands arising from adsorbed CO, the adsorption of 13C0 and CO, on cerium oxide has also been studied by Fourier-transform i.r. spectroscopy."
[3] "CO is a useful probe in the characterization of surface properties of both metals' and metal oxides2 via adsorption. In addition to surface investigations, the subject of CO adsorption is closely related to the studies of reactions involving CO, such as CO hydrogenation and CO oxidation."
[4] "The bidentate carbonate species can be converted into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, especially at high temperature."
[5] "Surface OH groups prohibit CO adsorption. This is interpreted as indicating that there are no active sites for CO coordination."

1. Infrared spectroscopic studies of CO adsorption on cerium oxide have been limited until recently, despite extensive research on CO adsorption on metal oxides.
2. Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the adsorption of CO and CO, on cerium oxide to identify the bands arising from CO adsorption.
3. CO can serve as a useful tool for characterizing the surface properties of metals and metal oxides through adsorption. CO adsorption studies are also related to reactions involving CO, such as hydrogenation and oxidation.
4. The bidentate carbonate species can transform into unidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, particularly at high temperatures.
5. Hydroxyl groups on the surface prevent CO adsorption, suggesting the absence of active sites for CO coordination.

1. 对铈氧化物上CO吸附的红外光谱研究直到最近才开始，尽管金属氧化物上的CO吸附研究已经非常广泛。
2. 使用红外光谱技术研究了CO和CO,在铈氧化物上的吸附，以识别CO吸附产生的波段。
3. CO可以作为表征金属和金属氧化物表面性质的有用工具，通过吸附。CO吸附研究也与涉及CO的反应相关，如氢化和氧化。
4. 双齿碳酸盐物种可以在高温下转化为单齿碳酸盐和无机羧酸盐物种。
5. 表面羟基阻止CO吸附，这表明不存在用于CO协调的活性位点。
