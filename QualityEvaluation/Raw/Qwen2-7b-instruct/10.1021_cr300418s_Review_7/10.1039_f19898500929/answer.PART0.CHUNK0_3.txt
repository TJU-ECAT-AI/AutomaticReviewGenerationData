[1] "The adsorption of CO and CO, on cerium oxide has been studied by Fourier- transform infrared spectroscopy (F.t.i.r.)."
[2] "As for CO,adsorption, apart from weak bands at 1728, 1396, 1219 and 11 32 cm-' attributed to bridged carbonate species, bands due to unidentaie carbonate,bidentate carbonate and inorganic carboxylate species, similar to those arising from CO adsorption, were observed."
[3] "The mechanism of CO adsorption is also discussed."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies a more active and more oxidizing surface, facilitating the oxidation of reactants. This mechanism allows for the efficient transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactants, driving the chemical reactions forward.

火星-范克瑞伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）在氧化物表面进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更活跃且更具氧化性的表面，能够促进反应物的氧化。这种机制允许氧化物表面有效地将电子和氧原子转移到反应物上，推动化学反应向前发展。
