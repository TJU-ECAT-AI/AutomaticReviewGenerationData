[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (VOx) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen atoms are oxidized to form these vacancies, which then participate in the reaction process."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, which can enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism functions in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the creation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide catalyst's surface. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in assessing both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. A reduced ΔEv enables simpler oxygen vacancy formation, thereby boosting the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capacity.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（VOx）起作用。氧原子被氧化形成这些空位，然后参与反应过程。氧空位形成的能量需求（ΔEv）对于评估氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv使得氧空位更容易形成，从而提高表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
