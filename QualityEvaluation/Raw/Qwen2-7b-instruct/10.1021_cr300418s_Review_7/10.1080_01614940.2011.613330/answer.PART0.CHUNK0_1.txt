The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by involving oxygen vacancies in the oxidation process. Oxygen vacancies are created on the surface of the oxide catalyst, which then facilitates the adsorption of oxygen atoms. These oxygen atoms can then participate in the oxidation of the substrate, leading to the formation of products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the creation of oxygen vacancies is easier, which can enhance the catalytic activity by increasing the number of active sites on the surface. Additionally, a lower ΔEv can also improve the oxidizing ability by providing more oxygen atoms available for the oxidation process.

A lower ΔEv signifies that creating oxygen vacancies is more straightforward, enhancing catalytic activity by increasing the number of active sites on the surface. Moreover, a lower ΔEv can also boost the oxidizing ability by providing more oxygen atoms available for the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过涉及氧空位在氧化过程中的作用进行操作。在氧化物催化剂的表面上生成氧空位，从而促进氧原子的吸附。这些氧原子随后参与对基质的氧化，导致产物的形成。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明创建氧空位更为容易，通过增加表面的活性位点来增强催化活性。此外，较低的ΔEv还可以通过提供更多的氧原子用于氧化过程，从而提升氧化能力。
