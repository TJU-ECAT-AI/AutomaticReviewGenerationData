[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, where oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in the reaction pathway. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is a theoretical framework that explains the process of oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Oxygen vacancies are key elements in this mechanism, acting as active sites for the reaction. The energy needed for the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) is critical in influencing both the efficiency of the catalytic process and the capability of the oxide surface to oxidize substances. This energy requirement essentially dictates the rate and effectiveness of the oxidation reactions taking place.
