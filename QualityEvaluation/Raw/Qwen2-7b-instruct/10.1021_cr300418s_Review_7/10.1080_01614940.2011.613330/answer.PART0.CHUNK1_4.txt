[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by forming an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
[2] "With increasing ΔEv, the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface tend to decrease."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of an oxide in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy needed for this vacancy formation (ΔEv) is pivotal in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically correlates with reduced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.
