[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
[2] "The presence of oxygen vacancies facilitates the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which subsequently react with other species on the surface. The ΔEv is crucial as it influences the stability of these vacancies and thus affects the reaction kinetics."
[3] "For the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to be effective, a balance must be struck between the stability of the oxygen vacancies and the reactivity of the surface towards the reaction substrates. This balance is dictated by the ΔEv."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the creation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in both enhancing the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This mechanism relies on the stability and reactivity of the oxygen vacancies, which are governed by the ΔEv. Achieving an optimal balance between these factors ensures the efficiency of the reaction.
