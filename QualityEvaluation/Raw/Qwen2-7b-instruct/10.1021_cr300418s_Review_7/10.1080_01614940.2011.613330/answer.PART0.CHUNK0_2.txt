[1] "The resource of natural gas rival natural oil. The composition of natural gas depends on its origin, but the main component is always methane."
[2] "A direct way for the conversion of methane into value-added products is the oxidative coupling (OCM) to ethane or ethylene."
[3] "The coupling of methane without an oxidant is a highly endothermic reaction and due to thermodynamic constraints the conversion is limited."
[4] "By introducing an oxidizing agent, the process becomes exothermic and the thermodynamic restrictions can be overcome."
[5] "However, from a thermodynamic point of view, the partial oxidation (Reaction 2) and the total oxidation (Reaction 3) are thermodynamically much more favored than the oxidative coupling of methane."
[6] "To obtain reasonable yields of C2 hydrocarbons (C2H6 and C2H4), the reaction must be controlled kinetically."
[7] "For this, suitable catalysts are necessary."
[8] "However, the known catalysts are not very active at low temperatures; thus, the reaction requires temperatures between 700-900 C, which leads to low yields (due to consecutive COx formation) and severe catalyst deactivation (due to decomposition or sintering, caused by the high reaction temperatures)."
[9] "In the past, the research strategy was often characterized by random testing of catalysts with a focus on maximization of the C2 yield."
[10] "This strategy has not led to a final breakthrough with respect to high selectivity and yield of C2 hydrocarbons."
[11] "Thus, studying only one catalytic system to understand the reasons for these limitations in detail is necessary."
[12] "The outcome of this research may be the basis for further efforts in optimizing catalyst formulations and maximizing catalyst performance."
[13] "At a later stage, high throughput testing of numerous different catalysts may be of advantage."
[14] "A combinatorial approach could also be a suitable strategy to establish a structure activity relationship, as recently reported (7)."
[15] "In the search for better catalysts, hundreds of materials have been tested."
[16] "Li-doped MgO showed higher performance than most other materials."
[17] "Lunsford et al. were among the first to publish extensive details about this catalytic system."
[18] "Li-doped MgO was and still is the object of intensive studies for several research groups."
[19] "Studies on MgO doped with other alkali metals did not lead to better catalysts."
[20] "In spite of all the research that has been done, many aspects remain unclear."
[21] "As it will be outlined in this review, the active center, the maximum solubility of Li in the MgO lattice, the position and nature of Li in the MgO, the stability of the catalyst, and many other questions are still not answered."
[22] "Therefore, identifying the points that need further investigation is not easy."
[23] "The aim of this article is to summarize the existing knowledge on Li/MgO and point out problems and unclarities that need further investigation."
[24] "Moreover, it is possible to perform quantum chemical studies and surface science experiments on Li-doped MgO, which is a rather difficult task for many other catalysts."
[25] "Such studies will identify the role and importance of different surface species within the catalytic reaction pathway."
[26] "This information will be used for the design of catalysts with better performance."
[27] "A very important question is the presence of species that contribute to unselective reactions, that should be avoided."
[28] "This publication focuses on Li/MgO and where necessary on MgO."
[29] "Further additives on Li/MgO are only discussed in Section 6."
[30] "Engineering aspects are not within the scope of this publication, although a variety of reports exist dealing with the engineering aspects of Li/MgO (17-27)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the catalytic activity by providing more reactive sites for the oxidation reaction. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests a less favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially reducing the catalytic activity. The oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is also influenced by ΔEv, as it affects the ease with which the oxide can accept electrons and facilitate the transfer of oxygen atoms to the substrate being oxidized. Therefore, understanding and manipulating ΔEv can be crucial in optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in various oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位形成更为有利，这可以增强催化活性，提供更多的活性位点进行氧化反应。相反，较高的ΔEv暗示氧空位形成不利，可能降低催化活性。氧化物表面的氧化能力也受ΔEv的影响，因为它影响氧化物接受电子的便利性，并促进氧原子转移到被氧化的基质。因此，理解并操纵ΔEv对于优化各种氧化反应中氧化物催化剂的性能至关重要。
