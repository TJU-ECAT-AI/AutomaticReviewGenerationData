[1] "The required minimum temperature for CH4 conversion is concordantly reported to be at approximately 600 C."
[2] "The CH4 conversion and the C2 yield increase with increasing reaction temperature, reaching a maximum at ca. 750 to 800 C."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen atoms migrate to form oxygen vacancies, which then facilitate the oxidation of the reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that fewer activation energies are needed for oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency and oxidizing power.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位进行操作。氧原子迁移到形成氧空位，然后促进反应分子的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着需要较少的激活能来形成氧空位，从而增强催化剂的效率和氧化能力。
