<quotes>
<p>The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions. ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations.</p>
<p>In the catalysis literature, it is tacitly assumed that the effect of a dopant is local; namely, it affects only the oxygen atoms in its proximity.</p>
<p>This model has an intriguing consequence. The dopants are viewed as an electron reservoir whose properties are described by μ alone. The electrochemical potential is a global quantity: it is the same at all sites in the system. In particular, the dopants in this model will affect the energy of vacancy formation no matter where the vacancy is located with respect to the dopant.</p>
<p>To test which one of these alternatives takes place, we calculated the energy of vacancy formation near the dopant and away from it for CeO2(111) doped with Y, La, Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W, and for MgO(001) doped with Li, Na, Ca, Ga, Al, Y, and Sc.</p>
<p>The effect of substitutional doping of ceria on the chemistry of the surface has been studied previously, by density functional theory, for the following dopants: Pd, Al, Sc, Y, Ta, Nb, La, Zr, Ir, Cu, Ni, Au, Ti, Hf, and Pt. We are not aware of any systematic study of the dependence of the energy of vacancy formation on the distance between the vacancy and the dopant.</p>
<p>All calculations were performed with the VASP package (22-26) with the PAW (26, 27) pseudopotential.</p>
<p>It is widely believed (28-32) that the DFT + U method provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than does GGA-DFT. In this article, we perform DFT + U calculations on the doped ceria surface under the approximation given by Dudarev (33) et al., as implemented in the VASP package. (22-26)</p>
<p>The Bader charges on the dopants were calculated by using the method proposed by Henkelman and co-workers. (38, 39) In this article, we give (see Table 1) what we call the Bader valence of the dopant, which is the number of electrons the dopant donates to the oxide.</p>
<p>We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide.</p>
<p>The LVDs affect the energy of vacancy formation because they create a hole at the top of the valence band. When an oxygen atom is removed, one of the unpaired electrons left behind lowers its energy by filling the hole created by the dopant. This mechanism is independent of the distance between the dopant and the site where the vacancy is formed.</p>
<p>In all the cases we examined, an LVD can be recognized a priori from the valence of the dopant in its own oxide and the valence of the cation in the host oxide (e.g., for Li-doped MgO, the monovalent Li replaces the divalent Mg).</p>
<p>An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace.</p>

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide, which facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for this formation, ΔEv, acts as a predictor of the oxide's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

2. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to be manipulated through doping. By replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations, the energy of oxygen vacancy formation can be altered, thereby influencing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

3. In the literature, it is commonly assumed that the impact of a dopant is localized, affecting only the oxygen atoms in its vicinity. However, the study explores whether this assumption holds universally, considering both local and global effects of dopants on oxygen vacancy formation energy.

4. The study calculates the energy of oxygen vacancy formation near and away from dopants in CeO2(111) and MgO(001) surfaces, doped with various elements. This approach tests the hypothesis that dopants might have both local and global effects on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

5. Doping techniques involving elements such as Pd, Al, Sc, Y, Ta, Nb, La, Zr, Ir, Cu, Ni, Au, Ti, Hf, and Pt have been previously studied on ceria surfaces using density functional theory. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into how the distance between the oxygen vacancy and the dopant influences the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

6. The calculations were conducted using the VASP package with the PAW pseudopotential method, providing a reliable framework for the analysis of the systems under study.

7. The DFT + U method, which enhances the description of oxygen vacancy formation, is employed in this research. This method improves upon the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) by incorporating the effects of strong electron correlations within the system.

8. The Bader valence of the dopant, calculated using Henkelman's method, serves as a descriptor for the number of electrons donated by the dopant to the oxide, offering insights into the nature of the dopant's influence on the oxide's properties.

9. The study reveals that low-valence dopants significantly reduce the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, both near and far from the dopant, regardless of whether the oxide is reducible or irreducible.

10. The mechanism by which LVDs lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation involves creating a hole at the top of the valence band. When an oxygen atom is removed, an unpaired electron fills this hole, thereby reducing the energy of the vacancy formation process. This mechanism operates independently of the distance between the dopant and the site of vacancy formation.

11. The LVDs can be identified before experimentation based on the valences of the dopant in its own oxide and the valence of the cation in the host oxide. This insight aids in predicting the effects of doping on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

12. Analysis of the projected density of states (PDOS) demonstrates that dopants like W and Mo donate two electrons to reduce two cerium atoms, while Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one cerium atom. Following these electron donations, these dopants have four electrons available for making bonds, akin to the cerium atom they replace.

1. 欧化物催化氧化反应中的火星-范克里夫机制通过要求在氧化物表面形成氧空位来运行，这促进了氧化过程。形成氧空位所需的能量ΔEv作为预测氧化物催化活性和氧化能力的关键指标。

2. ΔEv的重要性在于，可以通过掺杂来调整它，从而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。通过替换氧化物中的部分阳离子为其他阳离子，可以改变氧空位形成能的能量，进而影响氧化物的催化性能和氧化能力。

3. 文献中通常假设掺杂物的影响是局部的，仅影响其附近的氧原子。然而，本研究探索了掺杂物是否可能具有全局效应，以影响氧空位形成能的能量。

4. 研究通过计算CeO2(111)和MgO(001)表面附近和远离掺杂物的氧空位形成能，对各种元素进行掺杂。这种方法测试了掺杂物可能同时具有局部和全局效应的假设。

5. 在之前的研究中，涉及Pd、Al、Sc、Y、Ta、Nb、La、Zr、Ir、Cu、Ni、Au、Ti、Hf等元素的掺杂技术已经在氧化铈表面上使用密度泛函理论进行了研究。然而，缺乏系统地调查氧空位与掺杂物之间的距离如何影响氧空位形成能的研究。

6. 使用VASP包和PAW赝势方法进行的计算提供了一种可靠的方法来分析研究系统。

7. DFT + U方法改进了GGA方法，通过纳入系统内的强电子相关性，增强了对氧空位形成的描述。

8. 根据Henkelman的方法计算的掺杂物的Bader电荷，提供了掺杂物向氧化物捐赠电子的数量描述，有助于理解掺杂物对氧化物性质的影响。

9. 研究表明，低价掺杂物显著降低了氧空位形成能，无论氧空位形成发生在掺杂物附近还是远处。

10. 掺杂物降低氧空位形成能的机制涉及在价带顶部创建一个空穴。当氧原子被移除时，一个不成对的电子填充这个空穴，从而降低氧空位形成能的能量。这一过程不受掺杂物与氧空位形成位置之间距离的影响。

11. 在实验之前，可以根据掺杂物在其自身氧化物中的价态以及宿主氧化物中阳离子的价态识别LVDs，这有助于预测掺杂对氧空位形成能的影响。

12. 对投影密度状态（PDOS）的分析表明，掺杂物如W和Mo捐赠两个电子来减少两个铈原子，而Ta和Nb捐赠一个电子来减少一个铈原子。在这些电子捐赠之后，这些掺杂物有四个电子用于形成键，类似于它们取代的铈原子。

<p>It is widely believed (28-32) that the DFT + U method provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than does GGA-DFT. In this article, we perform DFT + U calculations on the doped ceria surface under the approximation given by Dudarev (33) et al., as implemented in the VASP package. (22-26) We use the LDA functional with a U value of 5.5 eV because it gives the energy of the reaction CeO2  Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2, and the lattice constants for CeO2 are in agreement with experimental data. (30, 31)</p>
<p>When an oxygen vacancy is made, two electrons that were engaged in the bonds between the removed oxygen atom and the surface are left unpaired in the oxide. Pirovano, Sauer, and da Silva (28) and Peijun Hus group (29) have shown that these two unpaired electrons can make polarons localized on two Ce atoms. The vacancy-formation energy depends on the location of these polarons.</p>
<p>There is one factor that Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dopants have in common: the dopantoxygen bonds in their own oxides are much shorter than the CeO bond in ceria (see Table 3).</p>
<p>The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on ΔEv is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3. This gives ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants.</p>
<p>The PDOSs of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, and W are shown in Figure 6. We are interested in the orbitals created by the presence of the dopant whose energy is in the band gap. Doping with Pt creates six new orbitals having energy at the top of the valence band. These orbitals are localized on Pt (see Figure 7a,b) and are a mixture of mostly Pt atomic orbitals with some contribution from O and Ce orbitals. Doping with Ru creates four degenerate spinorbitals in the band gap, localized on the Ru dopant (see Figure 8a) and consisting of a combination of Ru orbitals with a small contribution from oxygen.</p>
<p>PDOS of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, or W in the top layer, having an oxygen vacancy near the dopant. In Figure 10, we show the PDOS of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, or W having an oxygen vacancy near the dopant. We examine Pt first since its electronic structure is different. Before an oxygen vacancy is made, there are six spinorbitals whose energy is in the band gap: four look very similar to the one shown in Figure 7a, and two are similar to that shown in Figure 7b. The six electrons populating these orbitals are all located mostly on the Pt dopant with minor contributions from the oxygen atoms.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a key indicator of both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The DFT + U method, as used in this article, provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than GGA-DFT. The U value of 5.5 eV is used in the LDA functional because it accurately predicts the energy of the reaction CeO2 → Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2 and matches experimental lattice constants for CeO2. The presence of an oxygen vacancy leads to the formation of two unpaired electrons that can localize on two Ce atoms, affecting the vacancy-formation energy. The dopants Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W have shorter dopantoxygen bonds compared to the CeO bond in ceria. The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond and the effect on ΔEv is partly due to the ease with which Ce ions can adjust their formal charge, allowing ceria to efficiently accommodate extra electrons from dopants. The electronic structures of CeO2(111) surfaces doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, and W are distinct, with Pt creating orbitals localized on Pt, and Ru forming degenerate orbitals localized on the Ru dopant. When an oxygen vacancy is near the dopant, the electronic structure of the surface is significantly altered, affecting the behavior of the dopants and the surrounding oxygen atoms.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）作为判断氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键指标。本文中使用的DFT + U方法比GGA-DFT提供了更好的氧空位形成描述。使用5.5 eV的U值在LDA函数中，因为它准确预测了反应CeO2 → Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2的能量，并与CeO2的实验晶格常数相匹配。存在氧空位会导致形成两个未成对电子，这些电子可以局部化在两个Ce原子上，影响空位形成能量。Ru、Zr、Nb、Ta、Mo和W等掺杂剂具有与铈氧键相比更短的掺杂氧键。掺杂剂的氧键强度与ΔEv效应之间缺乏相关性部分归因于铈离子能够轻松调整其正式电荷的能力，使得铈能够高效地容纳掺杂剂提供的额外电子。铂、钌、钽、钼和钨的掺杂后CeO2(111)表面的电子结构各不相同，铂创建位于铂上的轨道，而钌则形成位于钌掺杂剂上的退化轨道。当氧空位靠近掺杂剂时，表面的电子结构会显著改变，影响掺杂剂及其周围氧原子的行为。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring a specific energy, denoted as ΔEv, for the formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide. This energy is crucial as it predicts the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Traditionally, it is assumed that dopants have a localized effect, impacting only the oxygen atoms in their vicinity. However, the study reveals that low-valence dopants, such as Na, Li, La, and Y, exhibit both a short-range and long-range effect. These dopants lower the energy of creating an oxygen vacancy around them, often by a similar magnitude, despite having significantly different chemical properties and bond strengths with their respective oxides.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring a specific amount of energy (ΔEv) for the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the oxide. This energy is crucial for the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxide has a higher ability to facilitate the oxidation reaction, making it more effective as a catalyst. The energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation influences how easily oxygen molecules can adsorb, react, and desorb from the surface, thereby affecting the overall efficiency of the oxidation process. The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct impact on the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, making it a critical parameter in understanding and optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in various industrial applications.
