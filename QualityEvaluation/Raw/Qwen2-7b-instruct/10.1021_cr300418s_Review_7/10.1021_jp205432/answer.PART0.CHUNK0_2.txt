[1] "The methods used in the present calculations are explained in section 2."
[2] "The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."
[3] "The energy of ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations."
[4] "In the catalysis literature, it is tacitly assumed that the effect of a dopant is local; namely, it affects only the oxygen atoms in its proximity."
[5] "We find that low-valence dopants (Na and Li dopants in MgO and La and Y dopants in CeO2) have both a long-range and a short-range effect."
[6] "Furthermore, these dopants lower the energy of making an oxygen vacancy next to them by roughly the same amount."
[7] "This is puzzling because these dopants have vastly different dopantoxygen bond strength in their own oxide."
[8] "By analyzing the electronic structure of the doped oxide and the changes caused by vacancy formation, we suggest that they have similar effects on vacancy formation energy because when they dope ceria, they become tetravalent, just like the Ce atom they replace."
[9] "We found that these dopants do not affect the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a large distance."
[10] "The model used in the semiconductor literature to determine the effect of a dopant assumes that the main function of the dopant is to provide an electron reservoir whose chemical potential (Fermi energy) can influence the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation."
[11] "Obviously, the two quantities are not correlated."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a predictor of the oxide's ability to perform oxidation reactions.
2. ΔEv determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it can be manipulated by doping, which involves replacing some cations in the oxide with other cations.
3. In the catalysis literature, it's often assumed that dopants have a local effect, influencing only the oxygen atoms nearby.
4. Low-valence dopants, such as Na, Li, La, and Y, exhibit both a long-range and a short-range effect.
5. These dopants significantly reduce the energy required for making an oxygen vacancy next to them.
6. Despite having vastly different dopantoxygen bond strengths in their own oxides, these dopants lower the vacancy formation energy by a similar amount.
7. The reason for this similarity lies in their ability to become tetravalent when doping ceria, mirroring the Ce atom's valence.
8. High-valence dopants, like Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Mo, and W, do not have a long-range effect on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation.
9. The model in the semiconductor literature suggests that the effect of a dopant is determined by its ability to act as an electron reservoir, affecting the Fermi energy.
10. However, this model fails to correlate with the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at a large distance.
11. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation does not correlate with the change in the Fermi level caused by doping.

1. 马斯-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过使用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）作为预测氧化物执行氧化反应能力的指标。
2. ΔEv决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化性，因为它可以通过掺杂来调整，而掺杂涉及用其他阳离子替换氧化物中的某些阳离子。
3. 在催化文献中，通常假设掺杂物具有局部效应，仅影响其附近的氧原子。
4. 低价掺杂物，如Na、Li、La和Y，表现出长程和短程效应。
5. 这些掺杂物显著降低了它们附近形成氧空位所需的能量。
6. 尽管它们在各自氧化物中的氧-掺杂物键强度差异很大，但这些掺杂物降低了形成氧空位的能量相似量。
7. 这种相似性的原因在于它们能够在掺杂铈化物时成为四价态，类似于铈原子的价态。
8. 高价掺杂物，如Pt、Ru、Zr、Ta、Mo和W，对氧空位形成能的远距离效应没有影响。
9. 半导体文献中使用的模型表明，掺杂物的作用取决于其作为电子存储库的能力，影响费米能。
10. 然而，这个模型与大距离处的氧空位形成能无关。
11. 氧空位形成能与掺杂引起的费米能变化无关。
