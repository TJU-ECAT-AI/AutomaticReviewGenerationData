[1] "The effect of dopants on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of ceria can be both local and global."
[2] "For example, doping ceria with La or Y lowers the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation more than other dopants and has a long-range effect."
[3] "The LVDs (low-valence dopants) affect the energy of vacancy formation because they create a hole at the top of the valence band."
[4] "When an oxygen atom is removed, one of the unpaired electrons left behind lowers its energy by filling the hole created by the dopant."
[5] "This mechanism is independent of the distance between the dopant and the site where the vacancy is formed."
[6] "In contrast, high-valence dopants (such as Pt, Ru, Zr, Ta, Mo, and W) affect the energy of vacancy formation next to them by roughly the same amount, even though their chemical properties are vastly different."
[7] "One common feature of these dopants is that their bond to oxygen, in their own oxide, is much shorter than the bond between Ce and oxygen in CeO2."
[8] "This suggests that the dopants have difficulties making strong bonds with the oxygen atoms of ceria."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring a specific amount of energy (ΔEv) for the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the oxide. This energy is crucial for the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxide has a higher ability to facilitate the oxidation reaction, making it more effective as a catalyst. The energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation influences how easily oxygen molecules can adsorb, react, and desorb from the surface, thereby affecting the overall efficiency of the oxidation process. The significance of ΔEv lies in its direct impact on the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics, making it a critical parameter in understanding and optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in various industrial applications.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式需要特定的能量（ΔEv）来形成氧化物表面的氧空位。这种能量对于催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物具有更高的能力促进氧化反应，使其作为催化剂更为有效。氧空位形成所需的能量直接影响氧分子吸附、反应和脱附的容易程度，从而影响整体氧化过程的效率。ΔEv的重要性在于它直接决定了反应动力学和热力学，这使得理解并优化各种工业应用中氧化物催化剂性能成为可能。
