[1] "It is widely believed (28-32) that the DFT + U method provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than does GGA-DFT."
[2] "The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions."
[3] "In the catalysis literature, it is tacitly assumed that the effect of a dopant is local; namely, it affects only the oxygen atoms in its proximity."
[4] "We find that low-valence dopants (Na and Li dopants in MgO and La and Y dopants in CeO2) have both a long-range and a short-range effect."
[5] "Furthermore, these dopants lower the energy of making an oxygen vacancy next to them by roughly the same amount."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring a specific energy, denoted as ΔEv, for the formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide. This energy is crucial as it predicts the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Traditionally, it is assumed that dopants have a localized effect, impacting only the oxygen atoms in their vicinity. However, the study reveals that low-valence dopants, such as Na, Li, La, and Y, exhibit both a short-range and long-range effect. These dopants lower the energy of creating an oxygen vacancy around them, often by a similar magnitude, despite having significantly different chemical properties and bond strengths with their respective oxides.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过要求特定的能量，即ΔEv，来形成氧化物表面的氧空位。这一能量是预测氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键。传统上认为掺杂剂具有局部效应，仅影响其附近的氧原子。然而，研究表明，低价掺杂剂，如Na、Li、La和Y，同时表现出短程和远程效应。这些掺杂剂降低了周围区域形成氧空位的能量，通常以类似的数量级，尽管它们与各自氧化物的化学性质和与氧的结合强度有显著差异。
