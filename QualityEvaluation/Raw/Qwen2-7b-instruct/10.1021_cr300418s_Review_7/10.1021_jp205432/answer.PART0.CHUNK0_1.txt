<p>It is widely believed (28-32) that the DFT + U method provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than does GGA-DFT. In this article, we perform DFT + U calculations on the doped ceria surface under the approximation given by Dudarev (33) et al., as implemented in the VASP package. (22-26) We use the LDA functional with a U value of 5.5 eV because it gives the energy of the reaction CeO2  Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2, and the lattice constants for CeO2 are in agreement with experimental data.

<p>When an oxygen vacancy is made, two electrons that were engaged in the bonds between the removed oxygen atom and the surface are left unpaired in the oxide. Pirovano, Sauer, and da Silva (28) and Peijun Hus group (29) have shown that these two unpaired electrons can make polarons localized on two Ce atoms. The vacancy-formation energy depends on the location of these polarons.</p>
<p>There is one factor that Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W dopants have in common: the dopantoxygen bonds in their own oxides are much shorter than the CeO bond in ceria (see Table 3).</p>
<p>The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond in the oxide of the dopant and the effect of the dopant on ΔEv is explained, in part, by the ability of the Ce ions to change easily their formal charge from +4 to +3. This gives ceria great flexibility in adjusting to the extra electrons provided by these dopants.</p>
<p>The PDOSs of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, and W are shown in Figure 6. We are interested in the orbitals created by the presence of the dopant whose energy is in the band gap. Doping with Pt creates six new orbitals having energy at the top of the valence band. These orbitals are localized on Pt (see Figure 7a,b) and are a mixture of mostly Pt atomic orbitals with some contribution from O and Ce orbitals. Doping with Ru creates four degenerate spinorbitals in the band gap, localized on the Ru dopant (see Figure 8a) and consisting of a combination of Ru orbitals with a small contribution from oxygen.</p>
<p>PDOS of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, or W in the top layer, having an oxygen vacancy near the dopant. In Figure 10, we show the PDOS of CeO2(111) doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, or W having an oxygen vacancy near the dopant. We examine Pt first since its electronic structure is different. Before an oxygen vacancy is made, there are six spinorbitals whose energy is in the band gap: four look very similar to the one shown in Figure 7a, and two are similar to that shown in Figure 7b. The six electrons populating these orbitals are all located mostly on the Pt dopant with minor contributions from the oxygen atoms.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a key indicator of both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The DFT + U method, as used in this article, provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than GGA-DFT. The U value of 5.5 eV is used in the LDA functional because it accurately predicts the energy of the reaction CeO2 → Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2 and matches experimental lattice constants for CeO2. The presence of an oxygen vacancy leads to the formation of two unpaired electrons that can localize on two Ce atoms, affecting the vacancy-formation energy. The dopants Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W have shorter dopantoxygen bonds compared to the CeO bond in ceria. The lack of correlation between the strength of the dopantoxygen bond and the effect on ΔEv is partly due to the ease with which Ce ions can adjust their formal charge, allowing ceria to efficiently accommodate extra electrons from dopants. The electronic structures of CeO2(111) surfaces doped with Pt, Ru, Ta, and W are distinct, with Pt creating orbitals localized on Pt, and Ru forming degenerate orbitals localized on the Ru dopant. When an oxygen vacancy is near the dopant, the electronic structure of the surface is significantly altered, affecting the behavior of the dopants and the surrounding oxygen atoms.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）作为判断氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键指标。本文中使用的DFT + U方法比GGA-DFT提供了更好的氧空位形成描述。使用5.5 eV的U值在LDA函数中，因为它准确预测了反应CeO2 → Ce2O3 + 1/2 O2的能量，并与CeO2的实验晶格常数相匹配。存在氧空位会导致形成两个未成对电子，这些电子可以局部化在两个Ce原子上，影响空位形成能量。Ru、Zr、Nb、Ta、Mo和W等掺杂剂具有与铈氧键相比更短的掺杂氧键。掺杂剂的氧键强度与ΔEv效应之间缺乏相关性部分归因于铈离子能够轻松调整其正式电荷的能力，使得铈能够高效地容纳掺杂剂提供的额外电子。铂、钌、钽、钼和钨的掺杂后CeO2(111)表面的电子结构各不相同，铂创建位于铂上的轨道，而钌则形成位于钌掺杂剂上的退化轨道。当氧空位靠近掺杂剂时，表面的电子结构会显著改变，影响掺杂剂及其周围氧原子的行为。
