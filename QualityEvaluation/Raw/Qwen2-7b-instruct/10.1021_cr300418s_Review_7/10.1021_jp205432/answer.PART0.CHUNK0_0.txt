<p>The energy, ΔEv, required for making an oxygen vacancy at the surface of an oxide is sometimes used as a predictor of the ability of the oxide to perform oxidation reactions. ΔEv, and therefore, the catalytic activity, can be manipulated by doping, which consists of replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations.</p>
<p>In the catalysis literature, it is tacitly assumed that the effect of a dopant is local; namely, it affects only the oxygen atoms in its proximity.</p>
<p>This model has an intriguing consequence. The dopants are viewed as an electron reservoir whose properties are described by μ alone. The electrochemical potential is a global quantity: it is the same at all sites in the system. In particular, the dopants in this model will affect the energy of vacancy formation no matter where the vacancy is located with respect to the dopant.</p>
<p>To test which one of these alternatives takes place, we calculated the energy of vacancy formation near the dopant and away from it for CeO2(111) doped with Y, La, Pt, Ru, Zr, Nb, Ta, Mo, and W, and for MgO(001) doped with Li, Na, Ca, Ga, Al, Y, and Sc.</p>
<p>The effect of substitutional doping of ceria on the chemistry of the surface has been studied previously, by density functional theory, for the following dopants: Pd, Al, Sc, Y, Ta, Nb, La, Zr, Ir, Cu, Ni, Au, Ti, Hf, and Pt. We are not aware of any systematic study of the dependence of the energy of vacancy formation on the distance between the vacancy and the dopant.</p>
<p>All calculations were performed with the VASP package (22-26) with the PAW (26, 27) pseudopotential.</p>
<p>It is widely believed (28-32) that the DFT + U method provides a better description of oxygen-vacancy formation than does GGA-DFT. In this article, we perform DFT + U calculations on the doped ceria surface under the approximation given by Dudarev (33) et al., as implemented in the VASP package. (22-26)</p>
<p>The Bader charges on the dopants were calculated by using the method proposed by Henkelman and co-workers. (38, 39) In this article, we give (see Table 1) what we call the Bader valence of the dopant, which is the number of electrons the dopant donates to the oxide.</p>
<p>We found that the low-valence dopants (LVDs) lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation near them or far from them. This is true when they dope a reducible (CeO2) or an irreducible (MgO) oxide.</p>
<p>The LVDs affect the energy of vacancy formation because they create a hole at the top of the valence band. When an oxygen atom is removed, one of the unpaired electrons left behind lowers its energy by filling the hole created by the dopant. This mechanism is independent of the distance between the dopant and the site where the vacancy is formed.</p>
<p>In all the cases we examined, an LVD can be recognized a priori from the valence of the dopant in its own oxide and the valence of the cation in the host oxide (e.g., for Li-doped MgO, the monovalent Li replaces the divalent Mg).</p>
<p>An examination of the projected density of states (PDOS) shows that W and Mo donate two electrons to ceria to reduce two Ce atoms, and Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one Ce atom. After this electron donation, these dopants have only four electrons available for making bonds, just like the Ce atom they replace.</p>

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the oxide, which facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for this formation, ΔEv, acts as a predictor of the oxide's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

2. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to be manipulated through doping. By replacing some of the cations in the oxide with other cations, the energy of oxygen vacancy formation can be altered, thereby influencing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

3. In the literature, it is commonly assumed that the impact of a dopant is localized, affecting only the oxygen atoms in its vicinity. However, the study explores whether this assumption holds universally, considering both local and global effects of dopants on oxygen vacancy formation energy.

4. The study calculates the energy of oxygen vacancy formation near and away from dopants in CeO2(111) and MgO(001) surfaces, doped with various elements. This approach tests the hypothesis that dopants might have both local and global effects on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

5. Doping techniques involving elements such as Pd, Al, Sc, Y, Ta, Nb, La, Zr, Ir, Cu, Ni, Au, Ti, Hf, and Pt have been previously studied on ceria surfaces using density functional theory. However, there is a lack of systematic investigation into how the distance between the oxygen vacancy and the dopant influences the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

6. The calculations were conducted using the VASP package with the PAW pseudopotential method, providing a reliable framework for the analysis of the systems under study.

7. The DFT + U method, which enhances the description of oxygen vacancy formation, is employed in this research. This method improves upon the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) by incorporating the effects of strong electron correlations within the system.

8. The Bader valence of the dopant, calculated using Henkelman's method, serves as a descriptor for the number of electrons donated by the dopant to the oxide, offering insights into the nature of the dopant's influence on the oxide's properties.

9. The study reveals that low-valence dopants significantly reduce the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, both near and far from the dopant, regardless of whether the oxide is reducible or irreducible.

10. The mechanism by which LVDs lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation involves creating a hole at the top of the valence band. When an oxygen atom is removed, an unpaired electron fills this hole, thereby reducing the energy of the vacancy formation process. This mechanism operates independently of the distance between the dopant and the site of vacancy formation.

11. The LVDs can be identified before experimentation based on the valences of the dopant in its own oxide and the valence of the cation in the host oxide. This insight aids in predicting the effects of doping on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

12. Analysis of the projected density of states (PDOS) demonstrates that dopants like W and Mo donate two electrons to reduce two cerium atoms, while Ta and Nb donate one electron to reduce one cerium atom. Following these electron donations, these dopants have four electrons available for making bonds, akin to the cerium atom they replace.

1. 欧化物催化氧化反应中的火星-范克里夫机制通过要求在氧化物表面形成氧空位来运行，这促进了氧化过程。形成氧空位所需的能量ΔEv作为预测氧化物催化活性和氧化能力的关键指标。

2. ΔEv的重要性在于，可以通过掺杂来调整它，从而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。通过替换氧化物中的部分阳离子为其他阳离子，可以改变氧空位形成能的能量，进而影响氧化物的催化性能和氧化能力。

3. 文献中通常假设掺杂物的影响是局部的，仅影响其附近的氧原子。然而，本研究探索了掺杂物是否可能具有全局效应，以影响氧空位形成能的能量。

4. 研究通过计算CeO2(111)和MgO(001)表面附近和远离掺杂物的氧空位形成能，对各种元素进行掺杂。这种方法测试了掺杂物可能同时具有局部和全局效应的假设。

5. 在之前的研究中，涉及Pd、Al、Sc、Y、Ta、Nb、La、Zr、Ir、Cu、Ni、Au、Ti、Hf等元素的掺杂技术已经在氧化铈表面上使用密度泛函理论进行了研究。然而，缺乏系统地调查氧空位与掺杂物之间的距离如何影响氧空位形成能的研究。

6. 使用VASP包和PAW赝势方法进行的计算提供了一种可靠的方法来分析研究系统。

7. DFT + U方法改进了GGA方法，通过纳入系统内的强电子相关性，增强了对氧空位形成的描述。

8. 根据Henkelman的方法计算的掺杂物的Bader电荷，提供了掺杂物向氧化物捐赠电子的数量描述，有助于理解掺杂物对氧化物性质的影响。

9. 研究表明，低价掺杂物显著降低了氧空位形成能，无论氧空位形成发生在掺杂物附近还是远处。

10. 掺杂物降低氧空位形成能的机制涉及在价带顶部创建一个空穴。当氧原子被移除时，一个不成对的电子填充这个空穴，从而降低氧空位形成能的能量。这一过程不受掺杂物与氧空位形成位置之间距离的影响。

11. 在实验之前，可以根据掺杂物在其自身氧化物中的价态以及宿主氧化物中阳离子的价态识别LVDs，这有助于预测掺杂对氧空位形成能的影响。

12. 对投影密度状态（PDOS）的分析表明，掺杂物如W和Mo捐赠两个电子来减少两个铈原子，而Ta和Nb捐赠一个电子来减少一个铈原子。在这些电子捐赠之后，这些掺杂物有四个电子用于形成键，类似于它们取代的铈原子。
