[1] "Traditional approaches, based on either empirical potentials or standard implementations of the Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional (DFT) theories, have so far failed to provide a proper account of the multiple valency character of Ce, i.e., the change of valency Ce4+ Ce3+ of the Ce ions upon reduction."
[2] "The removal of a neutral surface oxygen atom leaves back two excess electrons that are shown to localize on two cerium ions neighboring the defect."
[3] "The calculated atomistic and electronic structures of the defect-free and reduced surfaces are shown to agree with spectroscopic and microscopic measurements."
[4] "The preferential defect segregation and the different chemical reactivity of the (111) and (110) surfaces are discussed in terms of energetics and features in the electronic structure."
[5] "The study of the reduced surfaces required supercells with larger surface area."
[6] "The principal effect of the relaxation is to reduce the distance between the external OCeO trilayer and the one underneath, the surface therefore displays an inward contraction with the overall effect of reducing the inner CeO bonds perpendicular to the surface by 2% in LDA+U and by 0.4% in GGA+U."
[7] "The calculated surface energy (Esurf = (Eslab – Ebulk)/A, where A is the total surface area) is very low, 1.02 and 0.72 J/m2 in LDA+U and GGA+U, respectively."
[8] "The principal effect of the relaxation is to reduce the surface CeO bond length by 2.0% in LDA+U and by 1.7% in GGA+U."
[9] "The calculated surface energy is 1.40 J/m2 (LDA+U) and 1.06 J/m2 (GGA+U), both values being higher than the corresponding energies of the (111) surface."
[10] "Reduction strongly modifies the electronic structure of ceria surfaces."
[11] "The vacancy formation energies calculated with the WannierBoys projector functions φ are higher: 4.95 eV (GGA+U) and 6.10 (LDA+U) for the defective (111) surface and 4.42 eV (GGA+U) and 5.50 eV (LDA+U) for the defective (110) surface."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing oxygen vacancies in the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies create a localized state on the Ce atoms, changing their valency from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This change in valency facilitates the oxidation process by providing an electron-rich environment for the reaction to proceed.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to increased availability of reactive sites. Conversely, higher ΔEv values suggest fewer oxygen vacancies, potentially limiting the surface's catalytic efficiency.

[1] "The role of the oxide substrate in traditional catalysts is passive, in that it merely provides a resistant support for the chemically active noble metals."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as reactive sites. Oxygen vacancies leave behind two excess electrons when formed, which localize onto the f-states of Ce4+ ions, reducing them to Ce3+. This electron localization is significant because it affects the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining these properties.

2. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the energy for surface reduction is calculated in terms of the energy of molecular oxygen (EO2). The formula is ΔEr = ECeO(2x) + x/2EO2(g) - ECeO2, where x represents the number of oxygen vacancies on the surface.

2. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，表面还原的能量是以分子氧（EO2）的能量来计算的。公式是ΔEr = ECeO(2x) + x/2EO2(g) - ECeO2，其中x代表表面上的氧空位数量。

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from an oxide surface to a reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically signifies a more stable surface, which may hinder the formation of reactive intermediates necessary for the oxidation reaction, potentially decreasing the catalytic activity. Conversely, a lower ΔEv might facilitate the formation of these intermediates, increasing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing ability of the surface.

2. The energetics and electronic structure of the (111) and (110) surfaces of ceria exhibit distinct properties that influence the surface's chemical reactivity. The (110) surface tends to have more open coordination, leading to enhanced surface reactivity and a preference for defect segregation compared to the (111) surface. This is attributed to differences in the energetics and features of the electronic structure between these two surfaces.

3. The energy for surface reduction, calculated in terms of the energy of molecular oxygen (EO2), provides a quantitative measure of the energetics involved in the reduction process. This value helps in understanding the stability and reactivity of the oxide surface during reduction reactions.

4. The surface structures of ceria, as well as the electronic density of states (DOS) of defective surfaces, align with experimental observations from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and photoemission spectroscopy. This consistency supports the theoretical models and validates the understanding of the defect structures and their impact on the surface's chemical behavior.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过促进氧化物表面向反应物分子转移氧原子而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较高的ΔEv通常意味着更稳定的表面，可能阻碍形成氧化反应所需的有效中间体，从而降低催化活性。相反，较低的ΔEv可能会促进这些中间体的形成，增加表面的催化效率和氧化能力。

2. 氧化铈（ceria）的（111）和（110）表面的能性和电子结构特性不同，影响表面的化学活性。与（111）表面相比，（110）表面倾向于具有更开放的配位，导致增强的表面反应性和缺陷偏置倾向。这种差异归因于这两个表面之间能性和电子结构特征的不同。

3. 表面还原的能量，以分子氧（EO2）的能量为基准进行计算，提供了一种定量衡量还原过程能性的方法。这一值有助于理解在还原反应期间表面的稳定性和活性。

4. 氧化铈的表面结构以及有缺陷表面的电子密度态（DOS）与扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、原子力显微镜（AFM）和光发射光谱学的实验观察一致。这种一致性支持理论模型并验证了对缺陷结构及其对表面化学行为影响的理解。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between oxygen vacancies and reactant molecules. Oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide act as electron donors or acceptors, depending on the redox state of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier electron localization and, consequently, higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as the surface can more readily form and utilize oxygen vacancies for reaction facilitation.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies leave behind two excess electrons that localize on two neighboring cerium ions, changing the valency of these ions from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This localized electron helps in facilitating the oxidation of species on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. The specific configuration of surface oxygen vacancies, whether they are on the surface or subsurface, also influences the catalytic performance. The (110) surface is found to have a preference for oxygen vacancy segregation compared to the (111) surface, which affects its catalytic activity.
