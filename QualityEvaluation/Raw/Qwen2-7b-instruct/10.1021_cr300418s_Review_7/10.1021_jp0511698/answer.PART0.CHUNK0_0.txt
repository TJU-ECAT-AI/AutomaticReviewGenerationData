[1] "Traditional approaches, based on either empirical potentials or standard implementations of the Hartree-Fock (HF) or density functional (DFT) theories, have so far failed to provide a proper account of the multiple valency character of Ce, i.e., the change of valency Ce4+ Ce3+ of the Ce ions upon reduction."
[2] "The removal of a neutral surface oxygen atom leaves back two excess electrons that are shown to localize on two cerium ions neighboring the defect."
[3] "The calculated atomistic and electronic structures of the defect-free and reduced surfaces are shown to agree with spectroscopic and microscopic measurements."
[4] "The preferential defect segregation and the different chemical reactivity of the (111) and (110) surfaces are discussed in terms of energetics and features in the electronic structure."
[5] "The study of the reduced surfaces required supercells with larger surface area."
[6] "The principal effect of the relaxation is to reduce the distance between the external OCeO trilayer and the one underneath, the surface therefore displays an inward contraction with the overall effect of reducing the inner CeO bonds perpendicular to the surface by 2% in LDA+U and by 0.4% in GGA+U."
[7] "The calculated surface energy (Esurf = (Eslab – Ebulk)/A, where A is the total surface area) is very low, 1.02 and 0.72 J/m2 in LDA+U and GGA+U, respectively."
[8] "The principal effect of the relaxation is to reduce the surface CeO bond length by 2.0% in LDA+U and by 1.7% in GGA+U."
[9] "The calculated surface energy is 1.40 J/m2 (LDA+U) and 1.06 J/m2 (GGA+U), both values being higher than the corresponding energies of the (111) surface."
[10] "Reduction strongly modifies the electronic structure of ceria surfaces."
[11] "The vacancy formation energies calculated with the WannierBoys projector functions φ are higher: 4.95 eV (GGA+U) and 6.10 (LDA+U) for the defective (111) surface and 4.42 eV (GGA+U) and 5.50 eV (LDA+U) for the defective (110) surface."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing oxygen vacancies in the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies create a localized state on the Ce atoms, changing their valency from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This change in valency facilitates the oxidation process by providing an electron-rich environment for the reaction to proceed.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to increased availability of reactive sites. Conversely, higher ΔEv values suggest fewer oxygen vacancies, potentially limiting the surface's catalytic efficiency.

1. 马斯-范克雷维尔机制通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位来运作。氧空位在铈原子上产生局部状态，将它们的电荷从Ce4+改变为Ce3+。这种电荷的变化促进了氧化过程，提供了反应进行所需的电子丰富环境。

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位更容易形成，这可能导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为活性位点的可用性增加。相反，较高的ΔEv值暗示氧空位较少，可能限制表面的催化效率。
