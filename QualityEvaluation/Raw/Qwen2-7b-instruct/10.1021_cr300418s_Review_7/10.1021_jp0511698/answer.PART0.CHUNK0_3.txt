[1] "The atomistic and electronic structures of oxygen vacancies on the (111) and (110) surfaces of ceria are studied by means of periodic density functional calculations."
[2] "The removal of a neutral surface oxygen atom leaves back two excess electrons that are shown to localize on two cerium ions neighboring the defect."
[3] "The resulting change of valency of these Ce ions (Ce 4+  Ce3+) originates from populating tightly bound Ce 4f states and is modeled by adding a Hubbard U term to the traditional energy functionals."
[4] "The calculated atomistic and electronic structures of the defect-free and reduced surfaces are shown to agree with spectroscopic and microscopic measurements."
[5] "The preferential defect segregation and the different chemical reactivity of the (111) and (110) surfaces are discussed in terms of energetics and features in the electronic structure."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between oxygen vacancies and reactant molecules. Oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide act as electron donors or acceptors, depending on the redox state of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier electron localization and, consequently, higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as the surface can more readily form and utilize oxygen vacancies for reaction facilitation.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧空位和反应分子之间的电子转移而起作用。氧化物表面的氧空位作为电子供体或受体，取决于氧化物的还原状态。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表示更易实现电子定位，从而提高催化活性和氧化能力，因为表面可以更容易地形成和利用氧空位以促进反应。
