[1] "The role of the oxide substrate in traditional catalysts is passive, in that it merely provides a resistant support for the chemically active noble metals."
[2] "Ceria-based catalysts are presently used to abate pollutants from combustion exhausts and are believed to be key materials in the future hydrogen production technology."
[3] "The improvement in the conversion efficiency thus achieved is traced back to the presence of surface oxygen vacancies."
[4] "Knowing the local structure, clustering properties, and mobility of these defects is therefore of paramount importance for understanding their role in binding catalytic species and in enhancing both the reactivity of supported noble metals and the oxygen storage capacity."
[5] "The removal of a neutral surface oxygen atom leaves back two excess electrons that are shown to localize on two cerium ions neighboring the defect."
[6] "The calculated atomistic and electronic structures of the defect-free and reduced surfaces are shown to agree with spectroscopic and microscopic measurements."
[7] "Oxygen vacancies tend to segregate on the (110) rather than on the (111) surface."
[8] "For the (111) surface, the relative energy of surface/subsurface vacancy configuration involves small energy differences (compared to the vacancy formation energies) that depend on the level of approximation of the DFT functional and on the specific projection functions employed in the Hubbard U term."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies leave behind two excess electrons that localize on two neighboring cerium ions, changing the valency of these ions from Ce4+ to Ce3+. This localized electron helps in facilitating the oxidation of species on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. The specific configuration of surface oxygen vacancies, whether they are on the surface or subsurface, also influences the catalytic performance. The (110) surface is found to have a preference for oxygen vacancy segregation compared to the (111) surface, which affects its catalytic activity.

火星-范克瑞威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位起作用。氧空位留下的两个多余电子局部化在相邻的两个铈离子上，将这些离子的电荷从Ce4+改变为Ce3+。这个局部化的电子有助于促进表面物种的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值表明更容易形成氧空位，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。表面氧空位的具体配置，无论是表面还是亚表面，也影响催化性能。与（111）表面相比，（110）表面更倾向于氧空位的聚积，这影响其催化活性。
