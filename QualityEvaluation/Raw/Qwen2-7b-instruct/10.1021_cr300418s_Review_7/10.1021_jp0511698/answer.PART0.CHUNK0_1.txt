[1] "The role of the oxide substrate in traditional catalysts is passive, in that it merely provides a resistant support for the chemically active noble metals."
[2] "Their formation, i.e., the release of oxygen from the lattice, entails an excess of two electrons per vacancy, which localize into the f-states of Ce4+ ions, reducing them to Ce3+."
[3] "The addition of a Hubbard-U term to the LDA (or GGA) energy functional stabilizes the physical, insulating, ground state with respect to the metallic one."
[4] "Reduction strongly modifies the electronic structure of ceria surfaces. Figure 7 displays the DOS (GGA+U) of partially reduced CeO1.875 bulk ceria (panel a) and of the defective (111) and (110) surfaces (panels bd), calculated with the projector functions φ."
[5] "The energy for surface reduction (Table 2) is calculated in terms of the energy of molecular oxygen EO2:49 ΔEr = ECeO(2x) + x/2EO2(g)  ECeO2."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as reactive sites. Oxygen vacancies leave behind two excess electrons when formed, which localize onto the f-states of Ce4+ ions, reducing them to Ce3+. This electron localization is significant because it affects the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining these properties.

2. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the energy for surface reduction is calculated in terms of the energy of molecular oxygen (EO2). The formula is ΔEr = ECeO(2x) + x/2EO2(g) - ECeO2, where x represents the number of oxygen vacancies on the surface.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过利用氧空位作为活性位点来运作。当氧空位形成时，会留下两个过剩电子，这些电子局部化在Ce4+离子的f状态上，将它们还原为Ce3+。这种电子局域化对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对这些性质具有决定性作用。

2. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，表面还原的能量是以分子氧（EO2）的能量来计算的。公式是ΔEr = ECeO(2x) + x/2EO2(g) - ECeO2，其中x代表表面上的氧空位数量。
