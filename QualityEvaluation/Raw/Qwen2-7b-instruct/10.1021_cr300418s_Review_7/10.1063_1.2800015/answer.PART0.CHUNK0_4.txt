The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from an oxidant to an organic substrate through the formation of an adsorbed oxide species. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more favorable condition for oxygen vacancy formation, which can enhance the surface reactivity and thus improve the catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the oxide catalyst.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成吸附的氧化物种来促进氧化剂与有机基质之间的电子转移。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。ΔEv值较低表明更有利于氧空位的形成，这可以增强表面反应活性，从而提高氧化物催化剂的催化性能和氧化能力。
