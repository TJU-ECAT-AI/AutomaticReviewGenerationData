1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps including adsorption, reaction, and desorption of reactants on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to increased stability of the oxide surface, which can enhance its catalytic activity and oxidizing power.
