<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by forming an adsorbed oxide species that reacts with oxygen molecules to create an oxide compound. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.
