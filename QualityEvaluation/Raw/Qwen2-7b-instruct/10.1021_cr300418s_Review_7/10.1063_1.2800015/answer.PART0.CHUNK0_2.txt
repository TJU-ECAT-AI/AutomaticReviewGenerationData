The degree of Ce 4f localization refers to the extent to which cerium 4f electrons are localized within the cerium atom, rather than delocalized across the crystal lattice. This parameter is crucial for understanding the electronic properties of ceria. The band structure of ceria with and without defects provides insights into the energy levels of electrons within the material, which is essential for understanding its optical and electrical behavior. Quantifying the degree of Ce 4f localization helps in assessing the electronic configuration of cerium ions in the ceria structure. Similarly, quantifying the degree of total charge localization and the net ionic charge of Ce aids in elucidating the overall charge distribution within the ceria system. Magnetization, relaxed structures, and density of states (DOS) are key factors influencing the magnetic properties and electronic structure of ceria, including its ability to act as an effective catalyst in oxidation reactions.

度Ce 4f局部化指的是铈4f电子在铈原子内的局部化程度，而非在整个晶体格子中的分散。这一参数对于理解铈亚的电子性质至关重要。铈亚的带结构，在有和无缺陷的情况下，提供了电子在材料中能量水平的信息，这对于理解其光学和电学行为至关重要。量化Ce 4f局部化程度有助于评估铈离子在铈亚结构中的电子配置。同样，量化总电荷局部化程度和铈的净离子电荷有助于揭示铈亚系统内的整体电荷分布情况。磁化率、松弛结构和密度状态（DOS）是影响铈亚磁性和电子结构的关键因素，包括其作为有效氧化反应催化剂的能力。
