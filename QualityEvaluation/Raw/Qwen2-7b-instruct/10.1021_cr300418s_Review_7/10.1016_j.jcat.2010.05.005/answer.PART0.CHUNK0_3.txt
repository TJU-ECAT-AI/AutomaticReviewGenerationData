"The presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by involving a reductant, such as methane, to reduce the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. These vacancies then facilitate the oxidation process by making the oxygen atoms at these sites more reactive towards the oxidant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the ease with which oxygen atoms can be removed, thereby affecting the reactivity of the oxide surface towards a reductant. Lower ΔEv indicates a more reactive surface capable of oxidizing substrates more efficiently.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过引入还原剂，如甲烷，来还原氧化物表面，从而形成氧空位。这些空位使得表面的氧原子更容易被氧化剂反应，增加了氧化过程的活性。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着一个更活跃的表面，能够更有效地氧化底物。

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the reduction of the oxide surface by a reductant, leading to the creation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies enhance the reactivity of the oxygen atoms nearby, facilitating the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it indicates how easily oxygen atoms can be removed, impacting the surface's reactivity towards a reductant. A lower ΔEv signifies a more reactive surface that can oxidize substrates more efficiently.

2. Mars-van Krevelen机制包括氧化物表面由还原剂的还原，导致形成氧空位。这些空位增强了附近氧原子的活性，促进了氧化过程。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）至关重要，因为它决定了氧原子可以多容易地被移除，影响表面对于还原剂的活性。较低的ΔEv意味着一个更活跃的表面，能够更高效地氧化底物。
