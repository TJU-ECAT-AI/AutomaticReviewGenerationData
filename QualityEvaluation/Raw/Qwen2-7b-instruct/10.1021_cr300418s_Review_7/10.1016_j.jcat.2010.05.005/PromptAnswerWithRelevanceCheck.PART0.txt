The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving a reductant, such as methane, reducing the surface oxide to form oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more reactive the oxide becomes when exposed to a reductant. The presence of a dopant, such as Pt, weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms, making them more prone to removal and thus enhancing the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism suggests that the reaction takes place because in both cases the methane reacts with the doped oxide not with O2 or CO2. Probably methane reduces the oxide and O2 or CO2 reoxidize it, which is consistent with a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [32].

The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the results have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by suggesting that methane reacts with the doped oxide rather than with O2 or CO2. Methane reduces the oxide, and O2 or CO2 reoxidizes it, which aligns with the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen atom removal, enhancing the surface's reactivity when exposed to a reductant.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by involving the activation of a reductant (such as hydrogen or a hydrocarbon) by an oxidant (such as oxygen or a peroxide) on the surface of a catalyst. This activation facilitates the subsequent formation of reactive intermediates that can participate in the desired chemical reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) serves as an indicator of the oxidant's ability to remove oxygen atoms, which correlates with the surface's reactivity towards reducing agents. A lower ΔEv suggests easier removal of oxygen atoms, enhancing the surface's oxidizing capability.

2. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically involves the activation of a reductant (like hydrogen or a hydrocarbon) by an oxidant (such as oxygen or a peroxide) on the surface of a catalyst. The energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates an easier removal of oxygen atoms, implying a more reactive surface when exposed to reducing agents.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) serves as a proxy for the surface's oxidizing power. A reduced ΔEv signifies that the surface can more easily remove oxygen atoms, making it more reactive towards reducing agents.

In systems involving CO oxidation, the presence of a dopant modifies the chemical activity of the oxide surface, affecting its oxidizing ability and catalytic activity. This modification is indicative of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the dopant enhances the initial step of the mechanism by weakening the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the oxide, facilitating the activation of the reductant.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by involving a reductant, such as methane, to reduce the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. These vacancies then facilitate the oxidation process by making the oxygen atoms at these sites more reactive towards the oxidant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the ease with which oxygen atoms can be removed, thereby affecting the reactivity of the oxide surface towards a reductant. Lower ΔEv indicates a more reactive surface capable of oxidizing substrates more efficiently.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves a series of steps in which an oxide surface, such as ceria, reacts with a reductant like methane to produce oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is lower, the oxygen atoms are more easily removed, leading to a more reactive surface. This is because the oxygen atoms become more accessible to reductants, facilitating the oxidation reactions. In the case of ceria doped with platinum, the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond between neighboring oxygen atoms, reducing ΔEv and enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. This is consistent with the behavior found in other systems for CO oxidation by doped oxides.

马斯-范克瑞伦机制涉及一系列步骤，其中氧化物表面（如铈）与还原剂（如甲烷）反应以产生氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧原子更容易被移除，导致表面更加活跃。这是因为暴露在还原剂下的氧原子变得更加可及，从而促进氧化反应。对于铈掺杂的铂，表面层中铂的存在减弱了相邻氧原子之间的键，降低了ΔEv并增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这与掺杂氧化物中CO氧化行为一致。
