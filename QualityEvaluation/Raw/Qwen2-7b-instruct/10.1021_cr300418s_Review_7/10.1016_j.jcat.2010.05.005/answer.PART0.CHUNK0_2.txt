[1] "Our density functional calculations modeled the doped oxide with a ceria slab in which one Ce atom at the surface of the supercell is replaced by Pt. It is not possible to prepare samples in which all dopants are in the surface layer."
[2] "The presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."
[3] "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."
[4] "This is consistent with the behavior found in other systems for CO oxidation by doped oxides."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by involving the activation of a reductant (such as hydrogen or a hydrocarbon) by an oxidant (such as oxygen or a peroxide) on the surface of a catalyst. This activation facilitates the subsequent formation of reactive intermediates that can participate in the desired chemical reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) serves as an indicator of the oxidant's ability to remove oxygen atoms, which correlates with the surface's reactivity towards reducing agents. A lower ΔEv suggests easier removal of oxygen atoms, enhancing the surface's oxidizing capability.

2. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism typically involves the activation of a reductant (like hydrogen or a hydrocarbon) by an oxidant (such as oxygen or a peroxide) on the surface of a catalyst. The energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates an easier removal of oxygen atoms, implying a more reactive surface when exposed to reducing agents.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) serves as a proxy for the surface's oxidizing power. A reduced ΔEv signifies that the surface can more easily remove oxygen atoms, making it more reactive towards reducing agents.

In systems involving CO oxidation, the presence of a dopant modifies the chemical activity of the oxide surface, affecting its oxidizing ability and catalytic activity. This modification is indicative of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the dopant enhances the initial step of the mechanism by weakening the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms to the oxide, facilitating the activation of the reductant.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过在催化剂表面激活还原剂（如氢或碳氢化合物）来工作。这激活促进了随后形成的活性中间体参与所需的化学反应。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是衡量材料作为氧化剂的能力的一个指标。当特定的氧原子更容易被移除时，表明它们在面对还原剂时更具活性。较低的ΔEv意味着更易于去除氧原子，从而增强表面的氧化能力。

2. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通常涉及在催化剂表面上通过氧化剂（如氧气或过氧化物）激活还原剂（如氢或碳氢化合物）。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明表面更易于去除氧原子，这意味着当面对还原剂时，表面具有更高的活性。

形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是衡量表面氧化能力的代理指标。较低的ΔEv意味着表面可以更轻松地去除氧原子，使其对还原剂更具活性。

在涉及CO氧化的系统中，掺杂剂修改了氧化物表面的化学活性，影响其氧化能力和催化活性。这种修改体现了Mars-van Krevelen机制，其中掺杂剂通过削弱邻近氧原子与氧化物的键，增强了初始步骤的活性，从而促进还原剂的激活。
