[1] "The presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood, as evidenced by the fact that doping lowers the energy needed for creating oxygen vacancies."
[2] "We use the energy of making oxygen vacancies as an indicator of the ability of the material to act as an oxidant. The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."
[3] "In a nutshell, the dopant enhances the first step in a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving a reductant, such as methane, reducing the surface oxide to form oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The easier it is to create oxygen vacancies, the more reactive the oxide becomes when exposed to a reductant. The presence of a dopant, such as Pt, weakens the bond of neighboring oxygen atoms, making them more prone to removal and thus enhancing the first step of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及还原剂，如甲烷，将表面氧化物还原以形成氧空位。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。氧原子越容易被去除，暴露于还原剂时氧化物就越活跃。掺杂元素，如Pt，削弱了相邻氧原子之间的键，使它们更容易被移除，从而增强Mars-van Krevelen机制的第一步。
