"Reactions in which a spin needs to be flipped are likely to have a low rate."
"It is suspected that the density functional theory (DFT) with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) may not describe accurately the behavior of the electrons in the f-orbitals of the Ce atoms in CeO2."
"The weaker the bond between the oxygen atoms neighboring the Pt atom is, the more easily oxygen vacancies can be formed."
"The presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms located in its neighborhood."
"The easier specific oxygen atoms are to remove, the more reactive they are when exposed to a reductant."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves a series of steps in which an oxide surface, such as ceria, reacts with a reductant like methane to produce oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is lower, the oxygen atoms are more easily removed, leading to a more reactive surface. This is because the oxygen atoms become more accessible to reductants, facilitating the oxidation reactions. In the case of ceria doped with platinum, the presence of Pt in the surface layer weakens the bond between neighboring oxygen atoms, reducing ΔEv and enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. This is consistent with the behavior found in other systems for CO oxidation by doped oxides.

马斯-范克瑞伦机制涉及一系列步骤，其中氧化物表面（如铈）与还原剂（如甲烷）反应以产生氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧原子更容易被移除，导致表面更加活跃。这是因为暴露在还原剂下的氧原子变得更加可及，从而促进氧化反应。对于铈掺杂的铂，表面层中铂的存在减弱了相邻氧原子之间的键，降低了ΔEv并增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这与掺杂氧化物中CO氧化行为一致。
