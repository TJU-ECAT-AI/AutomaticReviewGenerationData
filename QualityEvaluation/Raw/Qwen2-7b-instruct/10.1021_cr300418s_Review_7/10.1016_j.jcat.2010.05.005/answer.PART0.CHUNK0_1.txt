The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism suggests that the reaction takes place because in both cases the methane reacts with the doped oxide not with O2 or CO2. Probably methane reduces the oxide and O2 or CO2 reoxidize it, which is consistent with a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism [32].

The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation has been measured but the results are at variance due to differences in the method of preparation. It is therefore not possible to compare reliably the values calculated here with experiments. Measurements of the equilibrium between gaseous O2 and ceria have been used to determine the enthalpy of oxygen-vacancy formation, and the results have been reviewed by Mongensen et al. [46]. It was found that when x in CeO2x is 105 the enthalpy of vacancy formation (to generate O2) is 2.6 eV. This is substantially smaller than the value of 3.36 eV obtained by DFT calculations.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by suggesting that methane reacts with the doped oxide rather than with O2 or CO2. Methane reduces the oxide, and O2 or CO2 reoxidizes it, which aligns with the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen atom removal, enhancing the surface's reactivity when exposed to a reductant.

火星-范-克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表明，甲烷与氧化物反应，而不是与O2或CO2反应来运行。甲烷还原氧化物，而O2或CO2重新氧化它，这与火星-范-克雷伦机制一致。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更易于去除氧原子，增强表面在还原剂暴露下的反应性。
