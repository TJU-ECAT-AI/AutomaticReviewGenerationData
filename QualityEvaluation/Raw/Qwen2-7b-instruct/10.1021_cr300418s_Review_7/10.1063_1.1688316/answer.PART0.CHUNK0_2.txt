[1] "Formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En5ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."
[2] "The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."
[3] "Formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."
[4] "The preferred location for the O vacancy is the second O-atomic layer for the CeO2(111) surface."
[5] "The additional charge resulting from the formation of the oxygen vacancies is localized in the first three layers of the surface."
[6] "The Ce 4f states are partially occupied on the reduced surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen from the surface of the oxide catalyst to the reactants, thus accelerating the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is easier, potentially increasing the surface's reactivity and enhancing its ability to facilitate oxidation reactions. This is because oxygen vacancies can act as active sites for reaction intermediates, promoting the adsorption and activation of reactants, thereby boosting the catalytic performance of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面氧化物催化剂上的电子和氧气向反应物的转移，加速了氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位的形成更容易，可能增加表面的活性，增强其促进氧化反应的能力。这是因为氧空位可以作为反应中间体的活性位点，促进反应物的吸附和激活，从而提高氧化物表面的催化性能。
