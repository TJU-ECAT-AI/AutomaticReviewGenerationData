[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En5ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."
[2] "The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."
[3] "For comparison, the formation energy of an O vacancy within the bulk was studied using a cubic 12-atom unit cell (Ce4O8) with one of the O atoms removed. The resulting formation energy was 4.73 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from a reducing agent to an oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to create an oxygen vacancy, which can enhance the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions. This is because the presence of oxygen vacancies can alter the electronic structure of the surface, making it more reactive towards incoming molecules. The mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy, which leads to an increase in the concentration of localized electrons near the vacancy. These electrons can then participate in the oxidation reaction, contributing to the overall catalytic activity of the surface. Thus, a reduced ΔEv suggests a more efficient and active surface in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进还原剂向氧化物催化剂的电子转移而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv意味着创建氧空位更为容易，这可以增强表面促进氧化反应的能力。这是因为氧空位的存在可以改变表面的电子结构，使其对进入分子更具反应性。该机制涉及形成氧空位，导致表面附近局部电子浓度增加。这些电子可以参与氧化反应，从而提高表面的整体催化活性。因此，较低的ΔEv表明表面在氧化物催化氧化反应中更加高效且活跃。
