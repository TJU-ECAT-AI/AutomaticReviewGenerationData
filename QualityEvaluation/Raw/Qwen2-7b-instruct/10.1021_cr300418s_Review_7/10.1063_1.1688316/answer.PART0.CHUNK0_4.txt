[1] "Formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En = ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."
[2] "The calculated values of En for the 111! and 110! surfaces, as well as the distance (dvac) between a vacancy and its nearest-neighbor image, are listed in Table II."
[3] "On the CeO2(111) p()31) surface, the formation energy of an O vacancy on the topmost O-atomic layer first layer! is 3.98 eV, which is close to the cost of creating an O vacancy in the third O-atomic layer, 3.96 eV. Interestingly, our calculations show that it is easier to create an O vacancy in the second O-atomic layer (En53.8 eV)."
[4] "For the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer, 3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively."
[5] "By comparing the formation energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between the oxide surface and reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values allow for easier creation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's ability to adsorb and oxidize reactants. The preferred location of an oxygen vacancy on different surfaces is closely related to the surface structure. The stability of the surface and the ease of oxygen vacancy formation vary with the surface type, influencing the surface's catalytic performance.

The significance of ΔEv is that it affects the surface's reactivity and selectivity. Surfaces with lower ΔEv values are more likely to have active oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the oxidation rate and efficiency of the reaction. The location of the oxygen vacancy also impacts the reaction pathway, as different surface orientations may lead to variations in the energy barrier for adsorption and reaction.

In summary, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves electron transfer from the oxide surface to reactants, and the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation dictates the surface's catalytic activity and reactivity. The preferred location of the oxygen vacancy depends on the surface structure, affecting the surface's efficiency in promoting oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面和反应物分子之间的电子转移来发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值使得更容易形成氧空位，从而增强表面吸附和氧化反应的能力。氧空位在不同表面上的优选位置与其表面结构密切相关。表面稳定性和氧空位形成的难度随表面类型而变化，影响表面的催化性能。

ΔEv的重要性在于它决定了表面的反应性和选择性。具有较低ΔEv值的表面更有可能存在活跃的氧空位，这可以提高反应速率和效率。氧空位的位置也会影响反应途径，不同的表面取向可能导致吸附和反应的能量壁垒的差异。

简而言之，火星-范克雷尔机制涉及表面向反应物的电子转移，而氧空位形成能垒决定了表面的催化活性和反应性。氧空位在表面上的优选位置取决于表面结构，影响表面在促进氧化反应方面的效率。
