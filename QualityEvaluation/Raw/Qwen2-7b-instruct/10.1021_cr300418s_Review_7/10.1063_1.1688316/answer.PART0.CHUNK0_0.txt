[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En5ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."
[2] "The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."
[3] "On the CeO2(111) p()31) surface, the formation energy of an O vacancy on the topmost O-atomic layer first layer! is 3.98 eV, which is close to the cost of creating an O vacancy in the third O-atomic layer, 3.96 eV. Interestingly, our calculations show that it is easier to create an O vacancy in the second O-atomic layer (En53.8 eV)."
[4] "For the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer, 3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. This energy barrier is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The lower the ΔEv, the more facile it is for oxygen vacancies to form, which in turn enhances the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions and increases its catalytic activity.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of oxygen vacancies is more easily achieved, which can lead to increased surface reactivity and enhanced catalytic performance. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests a more stable surface with potentially reduced catalytic activity.

3. For the CeO2(111) surface, the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy is lowest in the second layer, making it the preferred location for oxygen vacancy formation. This is in contrast to the topmost layer, which requires more energy to form a vacancy.

4. On the CeO2(110) surface, the formation energy for an oxygen vacancy is lower in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer. This suggests that the CeO2(110) surface is more conducive to oxygen vacancy formation, particularly in the surface layer, compared to the subsurface layer.

1. 摩斯-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。这种能量壁垒对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。ΔEv值越低，氧空位的形成就越容易，从而增强表面促进氧化反应的能力并提高其催化活性。

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位的形成更容易实现，这可以导致表面反应性增加和催化性能提升。相反，较高的ΔEv表明表面更稳定，潜在的催化活性可能降低。

3. 对于CeO2(111)表面，氧空位形成的能量最低是在第二层，这使得氧空位在该层的形成成为首选位置。相比之下，顶层需要更多的能量才能形成氧空位。

4. 对于CeO2(110)表面，氧空位的形成能量在表面层低于在次表面层。这表明CeO2(110)表面对氧空位的形成更加有利，尤其是在表面层相比次表面层。
