[1] "The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be calculated by En = ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!, where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface, and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."
[2] "The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy."
[3] "The conductivity and chemical properties are expected to be modified by the creation of O vacancies."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies can facilitate the transfer of electrons, which is crucial for the activation of reactants and the subsequent oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is easier, potentially enhancing the surface's ability to catalyze reactions by providing active sites for electron transfer. This process affects the conductivity and chemical properties of the oxide surface, making it more efficient in catalytic oxidation processes.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位起作用。氧空位可以促进电子的转移，这对于激活反应物和随后的氧化反应至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。ΔEv较低表明氧空位的形成更容易，可能增强表面的催化能力，提供电子转移的活性位点。这个过程影响氧化物表面的电导率和化学性质，使其在催化氧化过程中更有效。
