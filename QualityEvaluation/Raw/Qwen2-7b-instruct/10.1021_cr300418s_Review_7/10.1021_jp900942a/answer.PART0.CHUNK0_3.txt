[1] "Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations."
[2] "It is shown that Erelax is the dominating term and is determined by the local topological structures around the O vacancy."
[3] "Using this model, we are able to explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best OSC performance."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the model proposed in the document, ΔEv affects the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, which in turn influences the surface reactivity. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The document explains that at a content of 50% ZrO2 in ceria, the formation energy of oxygen vacancies is minimized, leading to the best oxygen storage capacity and thus the best catalytic performance.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。根据文档中提出的一种模型，ΔEv影响氧空位的形成能，进而影响表面反应性。当ΔEv较低时，它有助于形成氧空位，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。文档解释了在铈锆复合氧化物中，当锆含量为50%时，氧空位的形成能最小化，导致最佳的氧储存容量，因此具有最佳的催化性能。
