[1] "Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations."
[2] "It was found that the relaxation of Ce and Zr cations is much smaller than that of O ions."
[3] "Using this model, we are able to explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best OSC performance."
[4] "Specifically, O2 in T3 structure (surrounded by two Ce and two Zr cations) possesses the largest displacement, and it can be expected that a good OSC material should contain as many T3 structures as possible."

1. There is currently no comprehensive model that can account for the observed experimental data in the field of oxygen vacancy formation in composite oxides.
2. The relaxation of zirconium (Zr) and cerium (Ce) ions is significantly less pronounced compared to the surrounding oxygen (O) ions after an oxygen atom is removed.
3. By employing a specific model that considers the electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation, we can explain why ceria with 50% zirconia (ZrO2) demonstrates the highest oxygen storage capacity.
4. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of a material can be improved by maximizing the presence of T3 structures, which feature two zirconium (Zr) and two cerium (Ce) ions surrounding an oxygen vacancy, allowing for greater displacement and structural relaxation.

1. 目前，没有一个全面的模型可以解释复合氧化物中氧空位形成领域的实验观察数据。
2. 在移除氧原子后，锆(Zr)和铈(Ce)离子的松弛程度远小于周围的氧(O)离子。
3. 通过提出一个考虑静电相互作用和结构松弛的模型，我们可以解释为什么含有50%氧化锆(ZrO2)的铈(CeO2)具有最佳的氧存储能力。
4. 材料的氧存储能力（OSC）可以通过最大化T3结构的数量得到提高，T3结构包括两个锆(Zr)和两个铈(Ce)离子围绕着一个氧空位，允许更大的位移和结构松弛。
