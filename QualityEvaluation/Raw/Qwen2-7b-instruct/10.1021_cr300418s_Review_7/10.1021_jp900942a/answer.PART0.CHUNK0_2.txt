<p>The OSC of Ce1xZrxO2 is closely related to the ratio of Ce/Zr, and x at 0.5 (normally assigned as Ce0.5Zr0.5O2) generally gives higher OSC than others.</p>
<p>Ce1xZrxO2 exhibits unique oxygen storage capacity (OSC) (i.e., releasing/storing oxygen by forming/filling oxygen vacancies under reducing/oxidizing conditions).</p>
<p>Specifically, high OSC efficiency (89% with respect to the theoretical OSC value), has been achieved from the well-ordered Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 solid solution phase.</p>
<p>Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations.</p>
<p>To tackle these questions, in this study, we carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate formation energies of O vacancy in Ce1xZrxO2 with x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.</p>
<p>We propose a simple model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation energy based on detailed analyses of DFT results.</p>
<p>It was found that the formation energies of O vacancies are, indeed, largely determined by the structural relaxation.</p>
<p>The relaxation energies were found to correlate linearly with the ionic radius of the metal cation doped (R2 = 0.97).</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the study, the model proposes that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is decomposed into two terms: bond energy (Ebond) and relaxation energy (Erelax). The relaxation energy (Erelax) is found to be the dominating term and is determined by the local topological structures around the oxygen vacancy. The study explains that the OSC of Ce1xZrxO2 is closely related to the ratio of Ce/Zr, and the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 solid solution generally gives higher OSC efficiency. The model also helps to understand the doping effect on ceria, shedding new light on the basic understanding of how dopants influence ceria properties.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。根据研究，提出的模型将氧空位形成能分解为两个部分：键能（Ebond）和松弛能（Erelax）。发现松弛能（Erelax）是主导因素，并且由氧空位周围的局部拓扑结构决定。研究解释了Ce1xZrxO2的OSC与Ce/Zr的比例密切相关，且Ce0.5Zr0.5O2固溶体通常表现出更高的OSC效率。该模型也有助于理解掺杂剂对铈的影响，为理解掺杂剂如何影响铈的基本性质提供了新的视角。
