<p>The OSC of Ce1xZrxO2 is closely related to the ratio of Ce/Zr, and x at 0.5 (normally assigned as Ce0.5Zr0.5O2) generally gives higher OSC than others.</p>
<p>Ce1xZrxO2 exhibits unique oxygen storage capacity (OSC) (i.e., releasing/storing oxygen by forming/filling oxygen vacancies under reducing/oxidizing conditions).</p>
<p>Specifically, high OSC efficiency (89% with respect to the theoretical OSC value), has been achieved from the well-ordered Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 solid solution phase.</p>
<p>Despite this progress made in the field, there is no general model that can be used to rationalize the experimental observations.</p>
<p>To tackle these questions, in this study, we carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate formation energies of O vacancy in Ce1xZrxO2 with x = 0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.</p>
<p>We propose a simple model to understand the oxygen vacancy formation energy based on detailed analyses of DFT results.</p>
<p>It was found that the formation energies of O vacancies are, indeed, largely determined by the structural relaxation.</p>
<p>The relaxation energies were found to correlate linearly with the ionic radius of the metal cation doped (R2 = 0.97).</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the study, the model proposes that the oxygen vacancy formation energy is decomposed into two terms: bond energy (Ebond) and relaxation energy (Erelax). The relaxation energy (Erelax) is found to be the dominating term and is determined by the local topological structures around the oxygen vacancy. The study explains that the OSC of Ce1xZrxO2 is closely related to the ratio of Ce/Zr, and the Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 solid solution generally gives higher OSC efficiency. The model also helps to understand the doping effect on ceria, shedding new light on the basic understanding of how dopants influence ceria properties.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。根据研究，提出的模型将氧空位形成能分解为两个部分：键能（Ebond）和松弛能（Erelax）。发现松弛能（Erelax）是主导因素，并且由氧空位周围的局部拓扑结构决定。研究解释了Ce1xZrxO2的OSC与Ce/Zr的比例密切相关，且Ce0.5Zr0.5O2固溶体通常表现出更高的OSC效率。该模型也有助于理解掺杂剂对铈的影响，为理解掺杂剂如何影响铈的基本性质提供了新的视角。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the model proposed in the document, ΔEv affects the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, which in turn influences the surface reactivity. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The document explains that at a content of 50% ZrO2 in ceria, the formation energy of oxygen vacancies is minimized, leading to the best oxygen storage capacity and thus the best catalytic performance.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。根据文档中提出的一种模型，ΔEv影响氧空位的形成能，进而影响表面反应性。当ΔEv较低时，它有助于形成氧空位，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。文档解释了在铈锆复合氧化物中，当锆含量为50%时，氧空位的形成能最小化，导致最佳的氧储存容量，因此具有最佳的催化性能。

[2] "It was found that the relaxation of Ce and Zr cations is much smaller than that of O ions."
[3] "Using this model, we are able to explain why ceria with 50% ZrO2 exhibits the best OSC performance."
[4] "Specifically, O2 in T3 structure (surrounded by two Ce and two Zr cations) possesses the largest displacement, and it can be expected that a good OSC material should contain as many T3 structures as possible."

1. There is currently no comprehensive model that can account for the observed experimental data in the field of oxygen vacancy formation in composite oxides.
2. The relaxation of zirconium (Zr) and cerium (Ce) ions is significantly less pronounced compared to the surrounding oxygen (O) ions after an oxygen atom is removed.
3. By employing a specific model that considers the electrostatic interaction and structural relaxation, we can explain why ceria with 50% zirconia (ZrO2) demonstrates the highest oxygen storage capacity.
4. The oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of a material can be improved by maximizing the presence of T3 structures, which feature two zirconium (Zr) and two cerium (Ce) ions surrounding an oxygen vacancy, allowing for greater displacement and structural relaxation.
