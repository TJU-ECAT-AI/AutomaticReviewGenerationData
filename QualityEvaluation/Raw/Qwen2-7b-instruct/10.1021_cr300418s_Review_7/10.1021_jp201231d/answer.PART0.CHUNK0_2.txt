[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through a series of redox reactions involving oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves redox processes that utilize oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy creation (ΔEv) is crucial as it influences both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface.
