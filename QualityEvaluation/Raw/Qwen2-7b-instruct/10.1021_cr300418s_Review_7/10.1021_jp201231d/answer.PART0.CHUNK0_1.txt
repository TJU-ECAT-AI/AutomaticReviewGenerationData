[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through a series of steps involving the adsorption of oxygen and the subsequent oxidation of the reactant."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the adsorption of oxygen followed by the oxidation of the reactant. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.
