Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of reactants, activation of oxygen atoms, and subsequent oxidation processes. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies higher reactivity, as it facilitates easier oxygen atom activation and promotes more efficient surface reactions.
