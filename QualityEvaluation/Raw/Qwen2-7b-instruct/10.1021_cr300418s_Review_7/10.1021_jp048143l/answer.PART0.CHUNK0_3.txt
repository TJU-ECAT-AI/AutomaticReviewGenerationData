[1] "The low-coverage Ca reconstructions obtained by vapor deposition or bulk segregation are similar, in particular a well-ordered c(6×2) overlayer is formed."
[2] "At higher calcium coverages, only the disordered structure is found and it completely covers the rutile substrate."
[3] "The weak spots in the LEED pattern (Figure 8) suggest that either the overlayer has some order or it modifies the titania substrate in an ordered fashion."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from a reducing agent to an oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in this mechanism, as their formation requires energy (ΔEv). This energy is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power because it facilitates easier electron transfer and oxygen activation, thus enhancing the reaction rate and efficiency.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进还原剂与氧化物催化剂之间的电子转移而起作用。氧空位的形成需要能量（ΔEv）。这种能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为它更容易促进电子转移和氧气活化，从而提高反应速率和效率。
