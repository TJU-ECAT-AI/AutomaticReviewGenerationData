<p>The results for Ca coverages up to 1 ML indicate a 2D layer growth mode consistent with Ca/TiO2 interfacial interaction being stronger than the CaCa interaction.</p>
<p>Hence, a previous explanation of the c(6×2) LEED pattern in terms of antiphase boundaries between different domains of a p(3×1) structure5,6 does not seem to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Moreover, our high-resolution STM images evidence an overlayer with very large domains. Due to the symmetry of the titania substrate only translational or mirrored domains of a p(3×1) structure could exist.</p>
<p>A new reconstruction layer and the TiO2(110) surface are related by a matrix in real space. The titania surface and the new reconstruction are commensurate in the [110] direction.</p>
<p>The weak spots in the LEED pattern (Figure 8) suggest that either the overlayer has some order or it modifies the titania substrate in an ordered fashion.</p>
<p>Given the expected variation in charge transfer with coverage, it would be instructive in future work to investigate the oxidation state of Ca and the work function through the transition from the ordered to disordered phases.</p>

The study examines the structure of ordered calcium (Ca) adlayers on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces created through metal vapor deposition. The researchers compare this method to calcium segregation from the bulk. At low coverages, rows of width 0.6-0.9 nm develop in the [110] and [001] azimuths. At a single calcium layer coverage, a c(6×2) overlayer is formed. Above a single layer, a disordered structure develops, accompanied by a LEED pattern with symmetry. The ordered and disordered structures are attributed to calcium excess modifying the TiO2 substrate. The study also compares the results of vapor deposition with bulk segregation, finding them equivalent in the low-coverage regime.

该研究探讨了通过金属蒸汽沉积在钛酸盐表面上形成的有序钙（Ca）层的结构。研究人员将这种方法与从本体中分段钙进行比较。在低覆盖度下，宽度为0.6-0.9 nm的行在[110]和[001]方向上发展。在单个钙层覆盖率下，形成一个c(6×2)过层。超过一层时，形成一个无序结构，伴随着具有对称性的LEED模式。有序和无序结构归因于钙过剩修改了TiO2基板。该研究还将蒸发沉积的结果与本体分段进行了比较，在低覆盖率范围内发现它们是等效的。
