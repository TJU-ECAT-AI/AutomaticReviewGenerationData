[1] "The low-coverage Ca reconstructions obtained by vapor deposition or bulk segregation are similar, in particular a well-ordered c(6×2) overlayer is formed."
[2] "At higher calcium coverages, only the disordered structure is found and it completely covers the rutile substrate."
[3] "Our high-resolution STM images evidence an overlayer with very large domains."
[4] "The c(6×2) overlayer is described by the basic symmetry model shown in Figure 4b."
[5] "A similar site for Ca seems plausible. Models of such structures are presented in Figure 9."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv leads to greater catalytic activity and oxidizing power, as it enhances the availability of oxygen species for reaction.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物催化剂表面氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运作。氧空位形成的能量要求对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。更高的ΔEv导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它增强了可用于反应的氧物种的可用性。
