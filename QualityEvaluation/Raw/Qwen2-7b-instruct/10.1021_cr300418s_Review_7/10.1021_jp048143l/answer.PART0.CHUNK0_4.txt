[1] "Calcium is a common impurity of commercial titanium dioxide single crystals."
[2] "The deposition and segregation of metals on titanium dioxide has been a particular focus of attention (for a review, see ref 10)."
[3] "In the low-coverage regime, results from the BS experiment are essentially the same as those found for MVD."
[4] "As for the ordered overlayer up to a monolayer coverage, our STM results show clearly that the well-ordered overlayers form a genuine c(6×2) overlayer (Figure 3)."
[5] "The weak spots in the LEED pattern (Figure 8) suggest that either the overlayer has some order or it modifies the titania substrate in an ordered fashion."
[6] "With vapor deposition to coverages above a monolayer, the Ca excess gives rise to a highly disordered overlayer structure and is thought to induce a modification of the titania substrate."

1. Calcium is a common impurity in commercial titanium dioxide single crystals.
2. The deposition and segregation of metals on titanium dioxide are areas of particular interest.
3. The results from bulk segregation experiments in the low-coverage regime are similar to those from metal vapor deposition.
4. The STM results clearly demonstrate that up to a monolayer coverage, the calcium forms a genuine c(6×2) overlayer.
5. The weak spots in the LEED pattern indicate that the overlayer might have some order or modifies the titania substrate.
6. Excess calcium leads to a highly disordered overlayer structure when vapor deposition exceeds a monolayer coverage, suggesting a modification of the titania substrate.

1. 商业级二氧化钛单晶中钙是一种常见的杂质。
2. 钛酸盐上金属的沉积和同化是特别关注的领域。
3. 在低覆盖度情况下，从批量分离实验得到的结果与金属蒸气沉积方法得到的结果基本相同。
4. STM结果清楚地表明，在单层覆盖度下，钙形成真正的c(6×2)过层。
5. LEED模式中的弱点表明过层可能具有一定的有序性或对钛酸盐基底进行有序修改。
6. 当蒸气沉积超过单层覆盖度时，多余的钙导致高度无序的过层结构，并推测对钛酸盐基底产生修改作用。
