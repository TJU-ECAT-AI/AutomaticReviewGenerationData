[1] "The low-coverage Ca reconstructions obtained by vapor deposition or bulk segregation are similar, in particular a well-ordered c(6×2) overlayer is formed."
[2] "At higher calcium coverages, only the disordered structure is found and it completely covers the rutile substrate."
[3] "Our high-resolution STM images evidence an overlayer with very large domains."
[4] "The c(6×2) overlayer is described by the basic symmetry model shown in Figure 4b."
[5] "A similar site for Ca seems plausible. Models of such structures are presented in Figure 9."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv leads to greater catalytic activity and oxidizing power, as it enhances the availability of oxygen species for reaction.

<p>The results for Ca coverages up to 1 ML indicate a 2D layer growth mode consistent with Ca/TiO2 interfacial interaction being stronger than the CaCa interaction.</p>
<p>Hence, a previous explanation of the c(6×2) LEED pattern in terms of antiphase boundaries between different domains of a p(3×1) structure5,6 does not seem to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Moreover, our high-resolution STM images evidence an overlayer with very large domains. Due to the symmetry of the titania substrate only translational or mirrored domains of a p(3×1) structure could exist.</p>
<p>A new reconstruction layer and the TiO2(110) surface are related by a matrix in real space. The titania surface and the new reconstruction are commensurate in the [110] direction.</p>
<p>The weak spots in the LEED pattern (Figure 8) suggest that either the overlayer has some order or it modifies the titania substrate in an ordered fashion.</p>
<p>Given the expected variation in charge transfer with coverage, it would be instructive in future work to investigate the oxidation state of Ca and the work function through the transition from the ordered to disordered phases.</p>

The study examines the structure of ordered calcium (Ca) adlayers on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces created through metal vapor deposition. The researchers compare this method to calcium segregation from the bulk. At low coverages, rows of width 0.6-0.9 nm develop in the [110] and [001] azimuths. At a single calcium layer coverage, a c(6×2) overlayer is formed. Above a single layer, a disordered structure develops, accompanied by a LEED pattern with symmetry. The ordered and disordered structures are attributed to calcium excess modifying the TiO2 substrate. The study also compares the results of vapor deposition with bulk segregation, finding them equivalent in the low-coverage regime.

该研究探讨了通过金属蒸汽沉积在钛酸盐表面上形成的有序钙（Ca）层的结构。研究人员将这种方法与从本体中分段钙进行比较。在低覆盖度下，宽度为0.6-0.9 nm的行在[110]和[001]方向上发展。在单个钙层覆盖率下，形成一个c(6×2)过层。超过一层时，形成一个无序结构，伴随着具有对称性的LEED模式。有序和无序结构归因于钙过剩修改了TiO2基板。该研究还将蒸发沉积的结果与本体分段进行了比较，在低覆盖率范围内发现它们是等效的。

[1] "A comparison is made with structures formed by segregation of Ca from the bulk, with similar structures being found for the two preparation methods below a monolayer coverage."
[2] "The results for Ca coverages up to 1 ML indicate a 2D layer growth mode consistent with Ca/TiO2 interfacial interaction being stronger than the CaCa interaction."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it influences the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.
2. The comparison made in the document refers to the structures formed by the deposition of calcium (Ca) on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, both through metal vapor deposition (MVD) and segregation of Ca from the bulk material. Similar structures were observed for both preparation methods when the Ca coverage was below a monolayer.
3. The weak spots in the low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern indicate that the overlayer might have some degree of order or that it modifies the TiO2 substrate in an organized manner. This suggests that the overlayer does not completely disrupt the underlying structure, maintaining some level of order despite the disorder in the overlayer itself.

2. 文档中进行的比较涉及通过金属蒸气沉积（MVD）和从主体材料中分离钙（Ca）在钛酸盐表面上形成的不同结构。当钙覆盖量低于单层时，观察到两种准备方法下相似的结构。
3. LEED模式中的弱点表明，覆层可能具有某种程度的有序性，或者它以有组织的方式修改了钛酸盐基底。这表明覆层没有完全破坏底层结构，尽管覆层本身存在混乱，但仍保持一定程度的有序性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from a reducing agent to an oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in this mechanism, as their formation requires energy (ΔEv). This energy is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power because it facilitates easier electron transfer and oxygen activation, thus enhancing the reaction rate and efficiency.
