[1] "A comparison is made with structures formed by segregation of Ca from the bulk, with similar structures being found for the two preparation methods below a monolayer coverage."
[2] "The results for Ca coverages up to 1 ML indicate a 2D layer growth mode consistent with Ca/TiO2 interfacial interaction being stronger than the CaCa interaction."
[3] "The weak spots in the LEED pattern (Figure 8) suggest that either the overlayer has some order or it modifies the titania substrate in an ordered fashion."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it influences the reactivity and stability of the catalyst.
2. The comparison made in the document refers to the structures formed by the deposition of calcium (Ca) on titanium dioxide (TiO2) surfaces, both through metal vapor deposition (MVD) and segregation of Ca from the bulk material. Similar structures were observed for both preparation methods when the Ca coverage was below a monolayer.
3. The weak spots in the low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) pattern indicate that the overlayer might have some degree of order or that it modifies the TiO2 substrate in an organized manner. This suggests that the overlayer does not completely disrupt the underlying structure, maintaining some level of order despite the disorder in the overlayer itself.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克里夫机制通过促进氧化物表面的氧空位（ΔEv）形成来操作。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为它影响催化剂的反应性和稳定性。
2. 文档中进行的比较涉及通过金属蒸气沉积（MVD）和从主体材料中分离钙（Ca）在钛酸盐表面上形成的不同结构。当钙覆盖量低于单层时，观察到两种准备方法下相似的结构。
3. LEED模式中的弱点表明，覆层可能具有某种程度的有序性，或者它以有组织的方式修改了钛酸盐基底。这表明覆层没有完全破坏底层结构，尽管覆层本身存在混乱，但仍保持一定程度的有序性。
