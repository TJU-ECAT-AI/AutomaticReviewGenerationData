The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies a more active catalyst, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy creation, thereby enhancing the reaction rate and efficiency.

[1] "In order to address the criticisms raised in Ref. 2, we have repeated some of the calculations already presented in Ref. 1 using a newly generated Ce pseudopotential differing from the one used in Ref. 1 only in the proper account for the

1. The new Ce pseudopotential differs from the previous one by including the proper account for the Nonlinear Core Correction (NLCC).
2. The main effect of accounting for the NLCC in Density Functional Theory Plus U (DFT+U) calculations is observed in the calculated reduction energies.
3. The total energy calculated using DFT+U is dependent on the specific choice of the projector functions used to define the Hubbard-U functional.
4. In the case of ceria, the dependency of the total energy on the value of U tends to worsen the agreement with experimental data, especially when using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) level.

[2] "The reduction energy calculated with the Wannier-Boys orbitals 2.97 eV in LDA+U and 2.36 eV in GGA+U is effectively independent on the specific value of U and, in the case of the GGA+U calculations, it is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value."

The study shows that the DFT+U energy calculation is sensitive to the choice of projector functions for defining the Hubbard-U functional. However, when using Wannier-Boys orbitals, the reduction energy becomes independent of the specific value of U. This leads to better agreement with experimental data in GGA+U calculations.

The document discusses the effects of including the nonlinear core correction (NLCC) into the cerium pseudopotential used in density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By doing so, the pseudopotential results align more closely with all-electron (AE) calculations, particularly in terms of predicting the insulating character of reduced ceria. However, the inclusion of the NLCC at the DFT+U level does not affect the previously reported electronic structure and equilibrium geometries. The dependency of the DFT+U energy on the choice of the projector functions defining the Hubbard-U functional is discussed, with a suitable choice leading to energies agreeing with those predicted by plain DFT. The main effect of the Hubbard-U term appears to be enhancing the stability of the insulating solution without significantly altering its energy. The document also addresses criticisms regarding the insulating nature of reduced ceria, showing that a simple account for the overlap between core and valence densities using the NLCC brings pseudopotential results in substantial agreement with AE ones, making the insulating solution of Ce2O3 unstable at the plain DFT levels.

文献讨论了将非线性核心修正（NLCC）纳入用于密度泛函理论（DFT）计算的铈赝势的影响。通过这样做，赝势结果与全电子（AE）计算的预测更加一致，特别是在预测还原氧化铈的绝缘性质方面。然而，在DFT+U水平上包括NLCC不会影响之前报告的电子结构和平衡几何形状。讨论了DFT+U能量对定义Hubbard-U功能的投影函数形式的依赖性，合适的选择导致的能量与纯DFT预测的一致。Hubbard-U项的主要作用似乎是增强绝缘解决方案的稳定性，而不会显著改变其能量。文献还回应了关于还原氧化铈绝缘性质的批评，表明通过使用NLCC简单地考虑内核和价电子密度之间的重叠，可以将赝势结果与AE结果相匹配，使Ce2O3的绝缘解决方案在纯DFT水平下变得不稳定。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the stability of the oxide surface and thus influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more stable surface, which can lead to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to increased availability of active sites for reaction.
