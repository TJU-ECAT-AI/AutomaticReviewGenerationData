[1] "The dependency of the DFT+U energy on the choice of the projector functions defining the Hubbard-U functional is discussed in further detail."
[2] "The reduction energy calculated with the Wannier-Boys orbitals 2.97 eV in LDA+U and 2.36 eV in GGA+U is effectively independent on the specific value of U and, in the case of the GGA+U calculations, it is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value."

The study shows that the DFT+U energy calculation is sensitive to the choice of projector functions for defining the Hubbard-U functional. However, when using Wannier-Boys orbitals, the reduction energy becomes independent of the specific value of U. This leads to better agreement with experimental data in GGA+U calculations.

研究表明，DFT+U能量计算对定义Hubbard-U功能的投影函数选择敏感。然而，当使用Wannier-Boys轨道时，减少能量变得与特定的U值无关。这导致在GGA+U计算中与实验数据有更好的一致性。</ChineseVersionAnswer>
