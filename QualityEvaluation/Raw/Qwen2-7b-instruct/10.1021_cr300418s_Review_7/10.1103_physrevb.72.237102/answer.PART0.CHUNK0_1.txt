[1] "In order to address the criticisms raised in Ref. 2, we have repeated some of the calculations already presented in Ref. 1 using a newly generated Ce pseudopotential differing from the one used in Ref. 1 only in the proper account for the 
NLCC."
[2] "The main effect of the account for the NLCC in the DFT+U calculations is in the calculated values for the reduction energies."
[3] "We stress again that the DFT+U total energy depends on the specific choice of the projector func- tions used to define the Hubbard-U functional."
[4] "In the case of ceria, this dependency of the total energy on the value of U tends to deteriorate the fair agreement with experiment that can be obtained already at the plain GGA level."

1. The new Ce pseudopotential differs from the previous one by including the proper account for the Nonlinear Core Correction (NLCC).
2. The main effect of accounting for the NLCC in Density Functional Theory Plus U (DFT+U) calculations is observed in the calculated reduction energies.
3. The total energy calculated using DFT+U is dependent on the specific choice of the projector functions used to define the Hubbard-U functional.
4. In the case of ceria, the dependency of the total energy on the value of U tends to worsen the agreement with experimental data, especially when using the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) level.

1. 新的Ce赝势与之前的版本不同，通过包含了正确的非线性核心修正（NLCC）。
2. 在DFT+U计算中考虑NLCC的主要影响体现在计算的还原能上。
3. 使用DFT+U计算的总能量依赖于用于定义Hubbard-U函数的投影函数的具体选择。
4. 对于氧化铈，总能量对U值的依赖性会恶化与实验数据的一致性，尤其是在使用广义梯度近似（GGA）级别时。
