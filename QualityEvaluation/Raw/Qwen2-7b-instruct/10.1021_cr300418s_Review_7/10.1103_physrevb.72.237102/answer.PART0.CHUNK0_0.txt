The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies a more active catalyst, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy creation, thereby enhancing the reaction rate and efficiency.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位而运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更活跃的催化剂，因为它更容易促进氧空位的产生，从而提高反应速率和效率。
