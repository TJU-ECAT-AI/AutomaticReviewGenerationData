[1] "In the case of ceria, this dependency of the total energy on the value of U tends to deteriorate the fair agreement with experiment that can be obtained already at the plain GGA level."
[2] "The reduction energy calculated with the Wannier-Boys orbitals is 2.97 eV in LDA+U and 2.36 eV in GGA+U."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the stability of the oxide surface and thus influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more stable surface, which can lead to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to increased availability of active sites for reaction.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧原子转移到反应分子来发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的稳定性至关重要，进而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv通常表示表面更为稳定，这可以导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为活性位点的可用性增加以促进反应。
