[1] "A major reason for this interest is the relevance of their catalytic applications, in most of cases closely related to their ability for exchanging oxygen with their chemical environment."
[2] "Compared to the typical OSCD techniques, in which CO [6,7,10] or H2 [11,16] are used as reducing agents; in the case of OBC experiments, the reducing conditions are created by an inert gas atmosphere [17]."
[3] "By following this approach, a rather broad picture of the redox response of a certain material under a wide range of experimental conditions (temperature and chemical environment) may be summarised in a single plot."
[4] "Thus, the comparison of the low-temperature region, at Ti = 573 K, of 5%CO/He, 5%H2/Ar, He, and 5%O2/He plots in Fig. 2, strongly suggests that the reduction of the CT-80/20 sample is kinetically controlled under both hydrogen and helium flows, the reduction degree reached by the oxide being much lower than expected from the extrapolation of the results obtained at higher temperatures."
[5] "Likewise, the diagrams may help to rationalise some aspects of the redox behaviour of these materials which at a first sight might appear as striking."
[6] "Thus, Fig. 3 reports on the evolution of the OBC behaviour of the CT-90/10 sample as a function of the temperature."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (VOx) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates an easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This mechanism facilitates the transfer of electrons and oxygen molecules, promoting oxidation reactions on the surface.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面形成氧空位（VOx）来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更容易形成，这增强了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制促进了表面电子和氧分子的转移，促进表面的氧化反应。
