[1] "By following the same procedure under flowing 5%O2/He, 5%H2/Ar, and 5%CO/He, similar temperatureoxidation state plots could be depicted for sample CT-80/20, Fig. 2."
[2] "For any of these plots, the successive heating steps imply a progressive reduction of the oxide, the extent of which (Dd) depending on the nature of the flowing gas and the specific temperature step."
[3] "The comparison of the low-temperature region, at Ti = 573 K, of 5%CO/He, 5%H2/Ar, He, and 5%O2/He plots in Fig. 2, strongly suggests that the reduction of the CT-80/20 sample is kinetically controlled under both hydrogen and helium flows, the reduction degree reached by the oxide being much lower than expected from the extrapolation of the results obtained at higher temperatures."
[4] "Likewise, the diagrams may help to rationalise some aspects of the redox behaviour of these materials which at a first sight might appear as striking. Thus, Fig. 3 reports on the evolution of the OBC behaviour of the CT-90/10 sample as a function of the temperature."
[5] "As deduced from this figure, upon increasing the temperature, the capability of the oxide to attenuate the oscillations in the partial pressure of oxygen goes through a maximum at T = 873 K, and then it decreases."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. When an oxygen molecule adsorbs onto the surface, it splits into two oxygen atoms, one of which forms an oxygen vacancy. The second oxygen atom then reacts with a substrate molecule, leading to the oxidation of the substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as it facilitates faster and more efficient oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the reaction kinetics and efficiency.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface during oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is critical in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, facilitating faster and more efficient oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances reaction kinetics and efficiency.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面上形成氧空位而运作。当氧气分子吸附到表面时，它会分裂成两个氧原子，其中一个形成氧空位。第二个氧原子随后与一个基质分子反应，导致基质分子的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它促进了更快、更有效的氧空位形成，从而增强反应动力学和效率。

[1] "A major reason for this interest is the relevance of their catalytic applications, in most of cases closely related to their ability for exchanging oxygen with their chemical environment."
[2] "Key experimental variables like the nature and partial pressure of the reducing agent, or the reduction time and temperature, often differ from one lab- oratory to the other, thus very much complicating the correlation of OSC values from different sources."
[3] "By following this approach, a rather broad picture of the redox response of a certain material under a wide range of experimental con- ditions (temperature and chemical environment) may be summarised in a single plot."
[4] "For experiments carried out under flowing He, 5%H2/Ar, or 5%CO/He, the analytical device consisted of a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS)."
[5] "Likewise, the diagrams may help to rationalise some aspects of the redox behaviour of these materials which at a first sight might appear as striking."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is high, it indicates a large energy barrier for oxygen atom transfer, which can slow down the reaction rate but also increases the selectivity towards desired products. Conversely, a lower ΔEv facilitates faster oxygen atom transfer, enhancing the reaction rate but potentially leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to balance the competing demands of reaction rate and product selectivity, making it a critical parameter in the design and optimization of oxide catalysts.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (VOx) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates an easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This mechanism facilitates the transfer of electrons and oxygen molecules, promoting oxidation reactions on the surface.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the reaction becomes more facile, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and increased oxidizing power. Conversely, a high ΔEv signifies a less reactive surface, potentially reducing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing capacity of the oxide. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to modulate the reaction kinetics and selectivity, thereby impacting the overall performance of the oxide catalyst in various oxidation reactions.

[1] "By following this approach, a rather broad picture of the redox response of a certain material under a wide range of experimental conditions (temperature and chemical environment) may be summarised in a single plot."
[2] "The so-called oxygen buffering capacity (OBC) technique [1719] may also be included in the OSCD category."
[3] "Compared to the typical OSCD techniques, in which CO [6,7,10] or H2 [11,15,16] are used as reducing agents; in the case of OBC experiments, the reducing conditions are created by an inert gas atmosphere [17]."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to less efficient catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the thermodynamic reasons that the progressive decrease of Dd = di1, j2 di1, j1 upon increasing temperature above 873 K, where j2: He and j1: 5%O2/He.

2. The capability of the oxide to attenuate the oscillations in the partial pressure of oxygen shows a peak at T = 873 K, and then decreases with further temperature increase. This is interpreted as the thermodynamic reason for the loss of redox efficiency in the CT-90/10 sample.

2. 氧化物能够衰减氧气分压振荡的能力在T = 873 K时达到峰值，然后随着温度进一步增加而降低。这被解释为CT-90/10样品中红氧化效率损失的热力学原因。
