[1] "By following this approach, a rather broad picture of the redox response of a certain material under a wide range of experimental conditions (temperature and chemical environment) may be summarised in a single plot."
[2] "The so-called oxygen buffering capacity (OBC) technique [1719] may also be included in the OSCD category."
[3] "Compared to the typical OSCD techniques, in which CO [6,7,10] or H2 [11,15,16] are used as reducing agents; in the case of OBC experiments, the reducing conditions are created by an inert gas atmosphere [17]."
[4] "Moreover, secondary processes other than that implicitly assumed to be involved in the oxidising part of the OSC cycle, i.e. titration of oxygen vacancies, may significantly contribute to the OSC values."
[5] "The diagrams may help to rationalise some aspects of the redox behaviour of these materials which at a first sight might appear as striking."
[6] "Fig. 3 reports on the evolution of the OBC behaviour of the CT-90/10 sample as a function of the temperature."
[7] "As deduced from this figure, upon increasing the temperature, the capability of the oxide to attenuate the oscillations in the partial pressure of oxygen goes through a maximum at T = 873 K, and then it decreases."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to less efficient catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the thermodynamic reasons that the progressive decrease of Dd = di1, j2 di1, j1 upon increasing temperature above 873 K, where j2: He and j1: 5%O2/He.

2. The capability of the oxide to attenuate the oscillations in the partial pressure of oxygen shows a peak at T = 873 K, and then decreases with further temperature increase. This is interpreted as the thermodynamic reason for the loss of redox efficiency in the CT-90/10 sample.

1. 在氧化物催化的氧化反应中，火星-范克雷文机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位来操作。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更高的ΔEv通常导致效率较低的催化活性和氧化能力，这是由于随着温度高于873 K的增加，Dd = di1, j2 di1, j1的逐渐减少的热力学原因。

2. 氧化物能够衰减氧气分压振荡的能力在T = 873 K时达到峰值，然后随着温度进一步增加而降低。这被解释为CT-90/10样品中红氧化效率损失的热力学原因。
