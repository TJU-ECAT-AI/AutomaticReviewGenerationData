[1] "A major reason for this interest is the relevance of their catalytic applications, in most of cases closely related to their ability for exchanging oxygen with their chemical environment."
[2] "Key experimental variables like the nature and partial pressure of the reducing agent, or the reduction time and temperature, often differ from one lab- oratory to the other, thus very much complicating the correlation of OSC values from different sources."
[3] "By following this approach, a rather broad picture of the redox response of a certain material under a wide range of experimental con- ditions (temperature and chemical environment) may be summarised in a single plot."
[4] "For experiments carried out under flowing He, 5%H2/Ar, or 5%CO/He, the analytical device consisted of a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS)."
[5] "Likewise, the diagrams may help to rationalise some aspects of the redox behaviour of these materials which at a first sight might appear as striking."
[6] "As deduced from this figure, upon increasing the temperature, the capability of the oxide to attenuate the oscillations in the partial pressure of oxygen goes though a maximum at T = 873 K, and then it decreases."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is high, it indicates a large energy barrier for oxygen atom transfer, which can slow down the reaction rate but also increases the selectivity towards desired products. Conversely, a lower ΔEv facilitates faster oxygen atom transfer, enhancing the reaction rate but potentially leading to the formation of unwanted byproducts. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to balance the competing demands of reaction rate and product selectivity, making it a critical parameter in the design and optimization of oxide catalysts.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面氧原子向反应分子的转移来发挥作用。氧空位形成（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。当ΔEv较高时，表明氧原子转移的能量壁垒较大，这可能会减慢反应速率但同时增加对目标产物的选择性。相反，较低的ΔEv有助于加速氧原子转移，提高反应速率但可能导致形成副产品。ΔEv的重要性在于其能够平衡反应速率和产物选择性的竞争需求，使其成为设计和优化氧化物催化剂的关键参数。
