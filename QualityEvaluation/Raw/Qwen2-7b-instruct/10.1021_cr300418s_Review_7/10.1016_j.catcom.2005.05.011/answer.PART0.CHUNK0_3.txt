[1] "Thus, the comparison of the low-temperature region, at Ti = 573 K, of 5%CO/He, 5%H2/Ar, He, and 5%O2/He plots in Fig. 2, strongly suggests that the reduction of the CT-80/20 sample is kinetically controlled under both hydrogen and helium flows, the reduction degree reached by the oxide being much lower than expected from the extrapolation of the results obtained at higher temperatures."
[2] "Likewise, the diagrams may help to rationalise some aspects of the redox behaviour of these materials which at a first sight might appear as striking. Thus, Fig. 3 reports on the evolution of the OBC behaviour of the CT-90/10 sample as a function of the temperature."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the reaction becomes more facile, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and increased oxidizing power. Conversely, a high ΔEv signifies a less reactive surface, potentially reducing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing capacity of the oxide. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to modulate the reaction kinetics and selectivity, thereby impacting the overall performance of the oxide catalyst in various oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过表面氧空位的形成发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。当ΔEv较低时，反应变得更容易，导致催化活性增强和氧化能力提高。相反，较高的ΔEv意味着反应活性较低的表面，可能降低氧化物催化剂的整体催化效率和氧化能力。ΔEv的重要性在于其能够调节反应动力学和选择性，从而影响氧化物催化剂在各种氧化反应中的整体性能。
