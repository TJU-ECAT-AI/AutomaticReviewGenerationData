          [1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst."
          [2] "A lower ΔEv indicates that more oxygen vacancies can be easily formed, potentially enhancing the surface's reactivity and catalytic efficiency."
      </Quotes>
      <English>
          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen atoms from the reactants or the catalyst itself migrate to these vacancies to form oxygen molecules, which then participate in the oxidation process. Lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of more oxygen vacancies, enhancing surface reactivity and catalytic efficiency.

          火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位来运作。从反应物或催化剂本身迁移到这些空位的氧原子形成氧分子，然后参与氧化过程。较低的ΔEv意味着可以更容易地形成更多的氧空位，从而增强表面的反应性和催化效率。
