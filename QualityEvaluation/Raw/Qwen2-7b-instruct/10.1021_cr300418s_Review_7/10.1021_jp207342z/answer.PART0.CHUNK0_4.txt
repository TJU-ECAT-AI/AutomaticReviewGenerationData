[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is a widely accepted description of the reaction pathway for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions."
[2] "In this mechanism, oxygen vacancies play a crucial role as active sites for the adsorption of reactants and the release of products."
[3] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences the stability of these active sites and, consequently, the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism describes the reaction pathway for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, where oxygen vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption of reactants and the release of products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the stability of these active sites, thereby affecting the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
