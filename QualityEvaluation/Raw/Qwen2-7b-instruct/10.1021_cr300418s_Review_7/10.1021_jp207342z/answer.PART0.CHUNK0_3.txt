1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between reactants and the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies play a critical role in this process, as they can act as active sites for the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) affects the stability of these sites, thereby impacting the overall catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
