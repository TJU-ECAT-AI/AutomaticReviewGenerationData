[1] "To investigate whether the alternative path has the lowest energy for the low coverage case (<0:1 ML) reflecting the experimental conditions in Ref. [1], we calculated it using the same methodology [1,5]."
[2] "Specifically, DFT calculations were performed using the plane wave VASP code [6] with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard U [LSDA  U] method, which was shown to give better agreement with experiments [5,7]."
[3] "Our results (see Fig. 1) show that the barrier for Ob to O3f is around 1.0 eV for the GGA functional, but there is no local minimum at the O3f site with LSDA  U."
[4] "However, in both cases the rate determining barrier is found when passing through the Ti-O plane, and this is about 1.6 eV for GGA and 1.8 eV for LSDA  U."
[5] "This value is too high for thermally activated processes to be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion of H should be an extremely rare process."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of Ov, enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power of the oxide catalyst. In the context of hydrogen diffusion, the document discusses the barriers for hydrogen to migrate from the surface to a subsurface site, revealing that the alternative path via an intermediate in-plane oxygen site (O3f) offers a lower energy barrier compared to a direct path. This finding supports the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the presence and dynamics of oxygen vacancies facilitate the diffusion and reactivity of species on the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物表面的氧空位（Ov）的形成而运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表示Ov更易于形成，从而增强氧化物催化剂的催化效率和氧化能力。在氢扩散的背景下，文档讨论了氢从表面迁移到亚表面位置的障碍，揭示了通过平面内氧原子中间体（O3f）路径比直接路径提供更低的能量壁垒。这一发现支持了火星-范克雷伦机制，其中氧空位的存在及其动力学促进了表面物种的扩散和反应性。
