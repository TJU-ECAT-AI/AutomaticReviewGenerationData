Specifically, DFT calculations were performed using the plane wave VASP code [6] with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard U [LSDA  U] method, which was shown to give better agreement with experiments [5,7].

Our results (see Fig. 1) show that the barrier for Ob to O3f is around 1.0 eV for the GGA functional, but there is no local minimum at the O3f site with LSDA  U.

This value is too high for thermally activated processes to be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion of H should be an extremely rare process.

Indeed, the dynamics of surface H was studied experimentally in high statistical detail in recent fast STM studies (e.g.,[8]). Here, the removal or displacement of H adatoms, other than through a surface reaction, was never observed.

The study by Enevoldsen et al. utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the diffusion of hydrogen atoms on rutile TiO2 surfaces. They found that the barrier for hydrogen to move from bridging oxygen (Ob) on TiO2 (110) to a subsurface site (Osub) was approximately 2.4 eV under a coverage of 1/8 ML. For higher coverages, alternative paths via an in-plane oxygen site (O3f) were found to have lower barriers, around 1.1 eV for a coverage of 2 ML and 0.9 eV for 1 ML. The researchers calculated the barrier for hydrogen diffusion using the plane wave VASP code with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard U (LSDA U) method, which provided better agreement with experimental data compared to the standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method. They concluded that the barrier for hydrogen to move to a subsurface site was lower than initially considered, supporting the conclusion that hydrogen is manipulated to a subsurface location. The authors disagreed with the interpretation of room temperature behavior in the preceding Comment, stating that calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV, which is too high for thermally activated processes at room temperature, suggesting that spontaneous diffusion of hydrogen is an extremely rare process. Experimental studies on the dynamics of surface hydrogen using fast scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) did not observe the removal or displacement of hydrogen adatoms except through surface reactions.

埃内沃尔森等人的研究利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，探索了氧化钛表面上氢原子的扩散。他们发现，在1/8 ML的覆盖下，氢从氧化钛（110）表面的桥氧（Ob）移动到亚表面位置的壁垒约为2.4 eV。对于更高覆盖度，通过平面氧原子（O3f）存在替代路径，其壁垒约为1.1 eV（2 ML覆盖）和0.9 eV（1 ML覆盖）。研究人员使用平面波VASP代码结合局部自旋密度近似加Hubbard U（LSDA U）方法进行了计算，该方法与实验数据相比提供了更好的一致性，而标准广义梯度逼近（GGA）方法则没有。他们得出结论，氢向亚表面位置移动的壁垒低于最初考虑的值，支持氢被操纵到亚表面位置的结论。作者不同意前文评论中对室温行为的解释，指出计算预测的扩散壁垒至少为1 eV，这高于室温下热激活过程的阈值，暗示氢的自发扩散是一个极其罕见的过程。最近使用快速扫描隧道显微镜（STM）进行的表面氢动力学实验并未观察到除表面反应外的氢吸附原子的移除或位移。
