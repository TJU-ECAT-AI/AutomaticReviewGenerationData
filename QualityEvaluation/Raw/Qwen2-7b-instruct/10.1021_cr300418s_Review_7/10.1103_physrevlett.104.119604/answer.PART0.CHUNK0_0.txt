To explain an apparent tip-assisted movement of H atoms between the two sites, we predicted a barrier for hydrogen to diffuse directly from bridging oxygen (Ob) on TiO2 (110) to a subsurface site (Osub) of 2.4 eV for a H coverage of 1=8 ML using DFT. This barrier is in agreement with the 2.6 eV given in recent calculations for a higher coverage of 1 ML in Ref. [2], but is now questioned in the preceding Comment, Ref. [3].

A number of studies, Refs. [24], suggest that a lower energy path via an intermediate in-plane oxygen site (O3f) exists. For a coverage of 2 ML the barrier is predicted to be 1.1 eV [4], and for a coverage of 1 ML it is further reduced to 0.9 eV [2].

Specifically, DFT calculations were performed using the plane wave VASP code [6] with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard U [LSDA  U] method, which was shown to give better agreement with experiments [5,7].

Our results (see Fig. 1) show that the barrier for Ob to O3f is around 1.0 eV for the GGA functional, but there is no local minimum at the O3f site with LSDA  U. However, in both cases the rate determining barrier is found when passing through the Ti-O plane, and this is about 1.6 eV for GGA and 1.8 eV for LSDA  U.

Regardless of the H coverage, calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV. This value is too high for thermally activated processes to be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion of H should be an extremely rare process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its role as an energy barrier for oxygen transfer. When ΔEv is high, it requires more energy for oxygen vacancies to form, which can reduce the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Conversely, a lower ΔEv indicates easier oxygen transfer, potentially enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing capability of the oxide catalyst. The energy barrier associated with oxygen vacancy formation affects the reaction kinetics, influencing the rates at which reactants are converted to products under given conditions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运行。在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时，ΔEv的重要性在于它是氧气转移的能量壁垒。当ΔEv较高时，需要更多的能量来形成氧空位，这可能降低氧化物催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv表明氧气传递更容易，这可能增强氧化物催化剂的催化效率和氧化能力。与氧空位形成相关联的能量壁垒影响反应动力学，从而影响在给定条件下反应物转化为产物的速率。
