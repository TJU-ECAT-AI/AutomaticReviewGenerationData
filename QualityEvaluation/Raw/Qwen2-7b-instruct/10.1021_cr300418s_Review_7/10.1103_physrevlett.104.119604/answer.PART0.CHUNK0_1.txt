Specifically, DFT calculations were performed using the plane wave VASP code [6] with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard U [LSDA  U] method, which was shown to give better agreement with experiments [5,7].

Our results (see Fig. 1) show that the barrier for Ob to O3f is around 1.0 eV for the GGA functional, but there is no local minimum at the O3f site with LSDA  U. However, in both cases the rate determining barrier is found when passing through the Ti-O plane, and this is about 1.6 eV for GGA and 1.8 eV for LSDA  U.

The barriers remain significantly higher than the predictions of Refs. [2,4], and assuming the barrier for the total path was also considered, the difference must be due to the higher coverages.

We disagree with the interpretation of room temperature behavior in the Comment [3]. Regardless of the H coverage, calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV. This value is too high for thermally activated processes to be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion of H should be an extremely rare process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These Ov act as active sites for the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the stability of these active sites and thus influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate more stable Ov, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency in facilitating oxidation reactions. The barriers calculated for hydrogen migration, ranging from 1.0 eV to 1.8 eV depending on the functional used in the density functional theory calculations, are notably higher than those suggested by other studies. This discrepancy is attributed to the differences in coverage and possibly the consideration of the reaction energy from oxygen vacancy to the intermediate site. At room temperature, the calculated diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV is too high for thermally activated processes, suggesting that spontaneous diffusion of hydrogen is an extremely rare event under such conditions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（Ov）来运作。这些Ov作为吸附和随后氧化反应物的活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对活性位点的稳定性有重要影响，从而决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv值表示更稳定的Ov，增强催化剂在促进氧化反应方面的效率。根据密度泛函理论计算得到的氢迁移壁垒从1.0 eV到1.8 eV不等，取决于所使用的功能，与其它研究提出的壁垒相比显著更高。这种差异可能是由于覆盖度的不同，也可能是忽略了氧空位到中间位点的反应能量。在室温下，计算得到的至少1 eV的扩散壁垒对于热激活过程来说太高，表明氢的自发扩散是一个极其罕见的过程。
