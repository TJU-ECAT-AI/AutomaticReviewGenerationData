To explain an apparent tip-assisted movement of H atoms between the two sites, we predicted a barrier for hydrogen to diffuse directly from bridging oxygen (Ob) on TiO2 (110) to a subsurface site (Osub) of 2.4 eV for a H coverage of 1=8 ML using DFT. This barrier is in agreement with the 2.6 eV given in recent calculations for a higher coverage of 1 ML in Ref. [2], but is now questioned in the preceding Comment, Ref. [3].

A number of studies, Refs. [24], suggest that a lower energy path via an intermediate in-plane oxygen site (O3f) exists. For a coverage of 2 ML the barrier is predicted to be 1.1 eV [4], and for a coverage of 1 ML it is further reduced to 0.9 eV [2].

Specifically, DFT calculations were performed using the plane wave VASP code [6] with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard U [LSDA  U] method, which was shown to give better agreement with experiments [5,7].

Our results (see Fig. 1) show that the barrier for Ob to O3f is around 1.0 eV for the GGA functional, but there is no local minimum at the O3f site with LSDA  U. However, in both cases the rate determining barrier is found when passing through the Ti-O plane, and this is about 1.6 eV for GGA and 1.8 eV for LSDA  U.

Regardless of the H coverage, calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV. This value is too high for thermally activated processes to be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion of H should be an extremely rare process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its role as an energy barrier for oxygen transfer. When ΔEv is high, it requires more energy for oxygen vacancies to form, which can reduce the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Conversely, a lower ΔEv indicates easier oxygen transfer, potentially enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing capability of the oxide catalyst. The energy barrier associated with oxygen vacancy formation affects the reaction kinetics, influencing the rates at which reactants are converted to products under given conditions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运行。在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时，ΔEv的重要性在于它是氧气转移的能量壁垒。当ΔEv较高时，需要更多的能量来形成氧空位，这可能降低氧化物催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv表明氧气传递更容易，这可能增强氧化物催化剂的催化效率和氧化能力。与氧空位形成相关联的能量壁垒影响反应动力学，从而影响在给定条件下反应物转化为产物的速率。

The barriers remain significantly higher than the predictions of Refs. [2,4], and assuming the barrier for the total path was also considered, the difference must be due to the higher coverages.

We disagree with the interpretation of room temperature behavior in the Comment [3]. Regardless of the H coverage, calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV. This value is too high for thermally activated processes to be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion of H should be an extremely rare process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These Ov act as active sites for the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the stability of these active sites and thus influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate more stable Ov, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency in facilitating oxidation reactions. The barriers calculated for hydrogen migration, ranging from 1.0 eV to 1.8 eV depending on the functional used in the density functional theory calculations, are notably higher than those suggested by other studies. This discrepancy is attributed to the differences in coverage and possibly the consideration of the reaction energy from oxygen vacancy to the intermediate site. At room temperature, the calculated diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV is too high for thermally activated processes, suggesting that spontaneous diffusion of hydrogen is an extremely rare event under such conditions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（Ov）来运作。这些Ov作为吸附和随后氧化反应物的活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对活性位点的稳定性有重要影响，从而决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv值表示更稳定的Ov，增强催化剂在促进氧化反应方面的效率。根据密度泛函理论计算得到的氢迁移壁垒从1.0 eV到1.8 eV不等，取决于所使用的功能，与其它研究提出的壁垒相比显著更高。这种差异可能是由于覆盖度的不同，也可能是忽略了氧空位到中间位点的反应能量。在室温下，计算得到的至少1 eV的扩散壁垒对于热激活过程来说太高，表明氢的自发扩散是一个极其罕见的过程。

A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of Ov, enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power of the oxide catalyst. In the context of hydrogen diffusion, the document discusses the barriers for hydrogen to migrate from the surface to a subsurface site, revealing that the alternative path via an intermediate in-plane oxygen site (O3f) offers a lower energy barrier compared to a direct path. This finding supports the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, where the presence and dynamics of oxygen vacancies facilitate the diffusion and reactivity of species on the oxide surface.

Indeed, the dynamics of surface H was studied experimentally in high statistical detail in recent fast STM studies (e.g.,[8]). Here, the removal or displacement of H adatoms, other than through a surface reaction, was never observed.

The study by Enevoldsen et al. utilized density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore the diffusion of hydrogen atoms on rutile TiO2 surfaces. They found that the barrier for hydrogen to move from bridging oxygen (Ob) on TiO2 (110) to a subsurface site (Osub) was approximately 2.4 eV under a coverage of 1/8 ML. For higher coverages, alternative paths via an in-plane oxygen site (O3f) were found to have lower barriers, around 1.1 eV for a coverage of 2 ML and 0.9 eV for 1 ML. The researchers calculated the barrier for hydrogen diffusion using the plane wave VASP code with the local spin density approximation plus Hubbard U (LSDA U) method, which provided better agreement with experimental data compared to the standard generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method. They concluded that the barrier for hydrogen to move to a subsurface site was lower than initially considered, supporting the conclusion that hydrogen is manipulated to a subsurface location. The authors disagreed with the interpretation of room temperature behavior in the preceding Comment, stating that calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV, which is too high for thermally activated processes at room temperature, suggesting that spontaneous diffusion of hydrogen is an extremely rare process. Experimental studies on the dynamics of surface hydrogen using fast scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) did not observe the removal or displacement of hydrogen adatoms except through surface reactions.

埃内沃尔森等人的研究利用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，探索了氧化钛表面上氢原子的扩散。他们发现，在1/8 ML的覆盖下，氢从氧化钛（110）表面的桥氧（Ob）移动到亚表面位置的壁垒约为2.4 eV。对于更高覆盖度，通过平面氧原子（O3f）存在替代路径，其壁垒约为1.1 eV（2 ML覆盖）和0.9 eV（1 ML覆盖）。研究人员使用平面波VASP代码结合局部自旋密度近似加Hubbard U（LSDA U）方法进行了计算，该方法与实验数据相比提供了更好的一致性，而标准广义梯度逼近（GGA）方法则没有。他们得出结论，氢向亚表面位置移动的壁垒低于最初考虑的值，支持氢被操纵到亚表面位置的结论。作者不同意前文评论中对室温行为的解释，指出计算预测的扩散壁垒至少为1 eV，这高于室温下热激活过程的阈值，暗示氢的自发扩散是一个极其罕见的过程。最近使用快速扫描隧道显微镜（STM）进行的表面氢动力学实验并未观察到除表面反应外的氢吸附原子的移除或位移。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences the ease with which oxygen can be transferred and thus affects the reaction rate and efficiency. In the context of the document, it is mentioned that the barrier for hydrogen diffusion between different sites on the TiO2 surface is substantial, indicating that at room temperature, the spontaneous diffusion of hydrogen is unlikely to occur under normal conditions. This suggests that the mechanism of hydrogen movement, akin to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, might involve complex pathways and barriers that require activation energies, which are consistent with the presence of ΔEv influencing the reactivity of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧空位的转移来起作用。氧空位在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）很重要，因为它影响氧气的转移，从而影响反应速率和效率。根据文档中的内容，氢在TiO2表面不同位置之间的扩散壁垒相当大，表明在室温下，氢的自发扩散很可能不会在正常条件下发生。这表明氢移动机制，类似于火星-范克雷伦机制，可能涉及复杂的路径和壁垒，需要激活能，这与氧化物表面的反应性受ΔEv的影响是一致的。
