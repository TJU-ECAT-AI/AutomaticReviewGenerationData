To explain an apparent tip-assisted movement of H atoms between the two sites, we predicted a barrier for hydrogen to diffuse directly from bridging oxygen (Ob) on TiO2 (110) to a subsurface site (Osub) of 2.4 eV for a H coverage of 1=8 ML using DFT. This barrier is in agreement with the 2.6 eV given in recent calculations for a higher coverage of 1 ML in Ref. [2], but is now questioned in the preceding Comment, Ref. [3].

Our results (see Fig. 1) show that the barrier for Ob to O3f is around 1.0 eV for the GGA functional, but there is no local minimum at the O3f site with LSDA  U. However, in both cases the rate determining barrier is found when passing through the Ti-O plane, and this is about 1.6 eV for GGA and 1.8 eV for LSDA  U.

Regardless of the H coverage, calculations predict a diffusion barrier of at least 1 eV. This value is too high for thermally activated processes to be active at room temperature, and spontaneous diffusion of H should be an extremely rare process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences the ease with which oxygen can be transferred and thus affects the reaction rate and efficiency. In the context of the document, it is mentioned that the barrier for hydrogen diffusion between different sites on the TiO2 surface is substantial, indicating that at room temperature, the spontaneous diffusion of hydrogen is unlikely to occur under normal conditions. This suggests that the mechanism of hydrogen movement, akin to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, might involve complex pathways and barriers that require activation energies, which are consistent with the presence of ΔEv influencing the reactivity of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧空位的转移来起作用。氧空位在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）很重要，因为它影响氧气的转移，从而影响反应速率和效率。根据文档中的内容，氢在TiO2表面不同位置之间的扩散壁垒相当大，表明在室温下，氢的自发扩散很可能不会在正常条件下发生。这表明氢移动机制，类似于火星-范克雷伦机制，可能涉及复杂的路径和壁垒，需要激活能，这与氧化物表面的反应性受ΔEv的影响是一致的。
