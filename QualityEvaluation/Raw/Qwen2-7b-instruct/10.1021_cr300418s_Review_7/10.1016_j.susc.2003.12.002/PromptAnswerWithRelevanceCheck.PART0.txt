<quotes>
<p>It was noticed that nominally pure nanocrystalline ceria (n-CeO2d) ceramics showed a significantly enhanced n-type overall conductivity even under conditions under which the bulk is expected to be ionically conducting.</p>
<p>The following core-space charge picture [6] explains this: The grain boundary core in n-CeO2d ceramics is positively charged (this is also proposed for coarse-grained ceria [7]) resulting in accumulating electrons (e0) and depleting oxygen vacancies (V O) simultaneously in the vicinity of the interface (viz. space charge zones).</p>
<p>This leads to enhanced electronic and depressed ionic conductivities as confirmed in detail in Ref. [2].</p>
<p>One possibility is the segregation of dopants. As long as the electron accumulation is not severe in absolute carrier numbers (even though severe in terms of conductivity) we do not have to worry about the source of the accumulated conduction * * Corresponding author.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (V O) on the oxide surface, which facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to lower catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because it requires more energy to form oxygen vacancies, which might hinder the reaction kinetics. Conversely, lower ΔEv allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. This mechanism is fundamental in understanding and optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies allow for the adsorption of reactant molecules, facilitating the transfer of electrons and promoting the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more energetically favorable process, enhancing the catalyst's performance by enabling faster and more efficient oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of oxide catalysts. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically lead to decreased catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as they make it energetically more demanding for reactants to adsorb and undergo oxidation reactions. Conversely, lower ΔEv values facilitate easier adsorption and oxidation, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface.

[1] "Oxygen uptake/release from nanocrystalline ceria measured by thermogravimetric techniques under the conditions of interest for this study is found to be mainly due to surface nonstoichiometry rather than to bulk nonstoichiometry or molecular oxygen adsorption/desorption on the surface."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Under the conditions of interest for this study, the measurement of oxygen uptake/release from nanocrystalline ceria using thermogravimetric techniques primarily attributes this process to surface nonstoichiometry. This means that the primary cause of oxygen absorption or release is not due to bulk nonstoichiometry or the adsorption/desorption of molecular oxygen on the surface.

The measured oxygen partial pressure dependencies of nonstoichiometry, ranging from 0 to )1/2, for variously prepared nanocrystalline ceria powders can be explained by the coexistence of differently charged oxygen vacancies alongside charged impurities segregated onto the surface.

[1] "In this contribution we present studies on oxy- gen nonstoichiometry in n-CeO2d powder as a function of PO2, temperature and synthesis condi- tions by using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis combined with mass spectroscopy (MS)."
[2] "We will semi-quantitatively discuss the measured PO2 dependence of nonstoichiometry within the core- space charge model."
[3] "The amount of released/taken-up oxygen upon isobaric stepwise temperature changes was, on the other hand, calculated from a quantitative analysis of the MS oxygen signal, since the total weight changes of the sample in these conditions were dominated rather by the water desorption/ adsorption."
[4] "The oxygen release from a similar amount of microcrystalline CeO2d (99.999%, Aldrich, BET surface 10 m2/g, particle size 100 nm), on the other hand, amounts to less than one tenth of that of n-CeO2d, indicating that,indeed, the surface is predominantly responsible for a measured d in n-CeO2d, which is consistent with theoretical calculations."
[5] "As demonstrated in Ref. [2] for grain boundaries, the surface of the particles is consid- ered to be positively charged."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (V Os) and electron (e0) transfer. In the process, oxygen vacancies are formed, which can then accept electrons from the surface, leading to the formation of oxygen species that participate in the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency in promoting oxidation reactions. This mechanism is pivotal in understanding the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in various industrial applications, including the oxidation of hydrocarbons in petrochemical processes.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to a lower density of oxygen vacancies, affecting the surface's catalytic efficiency and its ability to oxidize substances.

2. The oxygen partial pressure dependencies of nonstoichiometry in differently prepared nanocrystalline ceria powders are explained by the presence of various charged oxygen vacancies, in addition to charged impurities segregated onto the surface.
