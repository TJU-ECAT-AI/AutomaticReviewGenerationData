[1] "The measured oxygen partial pressure dependencies of nonstoichiometry, varying from 0 to )1/2, for differently prepared nanocrystalline ceria powders can be explained by the presence of differently charged oxygen vacancies in addition to charged impurities segregated onto the surface."
[2] "As already pointed out the scatter is not unexpected and may be even further interpreted in terms of experimental conditions."
[3] "The measured value of )0.28 for n-CeO2d [A] corresponds to e  0:9 which indicate that the majority defect in the sample is V Os with some minor fraction of V x O (the same is true then for the slope of )1/3 measured by Knauth and Tuller [10]), while the value of )0.11 for n-CeO2d [B] corresponding to e  1:5 suggesting the majority defects to be V Os and V Os."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to a lower density of oxygen vacancies, affecting the surface's catalytic efficiency and its ability to oxidize substances.

2. The oxygen partial pressure dependencies of nonstoichiometry in differently prepared nanocrystalline ceria powders are explained by the presence of various charged oxygen vacancies, in addition to charged impurities segregated onto the surface. The values of the slopes indicate the predominant types of defects, with oxygen vacancies being the key factor in the surface's chemical behavior.

1. 罗斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较高的ΔEv通常导致氧空位密度较低，影响表面的催化效率及其氧化物质的能力。

2. 不同制备方法的纳米结晶铈氧化物粉末的氧分压依赖性非化学计量比可以由表面存在的不同电荷氧空位以及表面上分离的电荷杂质的共同作用来解释。所测量的斜率表明主要缺陷的类型，氧空位是决定表面化学行为的关键因素。
