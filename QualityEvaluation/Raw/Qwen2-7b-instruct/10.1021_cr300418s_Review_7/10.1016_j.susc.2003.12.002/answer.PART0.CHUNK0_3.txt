[1] "In this contribution we present studies on oxy- gen nonstoichiometry in n-CeO2d powder as a function of PO2, temperature and synthesis condi- tions by using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis combined with mass spectroscopy (MS)."
[2] "We will semi-quantitatively discuss the measured PO2 dependence of nonstoichiometry within the core- space charge model."
[3] "The amount of released/taken-up oxygen upon isobaric stepwise temperature changes was, on the other hand, calculated from a quantitative analysis of the MS oxygen signal, since the total weight changes of the sample in these conditions were dominated rather by the water desorption/ adsorption."
[4] "The oxygen release from a similar amount of microcrystalline CeO2d (99.999%, Aldrich, BET surface 10 m2/g, particle size 100 nm), on the other hand, amounts to less than one tenth of that of n-CeO2d, indicating that,indeed, the surface is predominantly responsible for a measured d in n-CeO2d, which is consistent with theoretical calculations."
[5] "As demonstrated in Ref. [2] for grain boundaries, the surface of the particles is consid- ered to be positively charged."
[6] "The defect equilibrium for a situation of charge separation can be approximately described by 1=2 O2  V e Os  ee0 1  Ox
O:"
[7] "Consequently, we now obtain from Eq. (3) that olnV e Os=olnPO2  1=2  e=4 4 since olne0 1=olnPO2  1=4, as obtained from the electrical measurements [2]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (V Os) and electron (e0) transfer. In the process, oxygen vacancies are formed, which can then accept electrons from the surface, leading to the formation of oxygen species that participate in the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency in promoting oxidation reactions. This mechanism is pivotal in understanding the catalytic behavior of oxide surfaces in various industrial applications, including the oxidation of hydrocarbons in petrochemical processes.

火星-范克瑞伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位（V Os）和电子（e0）转移来运作。在此过程中，形成氧空位，然后从表面接受电子，导致形成参与氧化反应的氧物种。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv使氧空位更容易形成，从而增强催化剂促进氧化反应的能力。这一机制对于理解氧化物表面在各种工业应用中的催化行为至关重要，包括在石油化学过程中对烃类的氧化。
