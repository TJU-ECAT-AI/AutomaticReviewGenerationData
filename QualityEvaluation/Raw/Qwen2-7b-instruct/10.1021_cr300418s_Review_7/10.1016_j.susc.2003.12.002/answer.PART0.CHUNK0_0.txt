<p>It was noticed that nominally pure nanocrystalline ceria (n-CeO2d) ceramics showed a significantly enhanced n-type overall conductivity even under conditions under which the bulk is expected to be ionically conducting.</p>
<p>The following core-space charge picture [6] explains this: The grain boundary core in n-CeO2d ceramics is positively charged (this is also proposed for coarse-grained ceria [7]) resulting in accumulating electrons (e0) and depleting oxygen vacancies (V O) simultaneously in the vicinity of the interface (viz. space charge zones).</p>
<p>This leads to enhanced electronic and depressed ionic conductivities as confirmed in detail in Ref. [2].</p>
<p>One possibility is the segregation of dopants. As long as the electron accumulation is not severe in absolute carrier numbers (even though severe in terms of conductivity) we do not have to worry about the source of the accumulated conduction * * Corresponding author.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (V O) on the oxide surface, which facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to lower catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because it requires more energy to form oxygen vacancies, which might hinder the reaction kinetics. Conversely, lower ΔEv allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. This mechanism is fundamental in understanding and optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷维尔机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（V O）来运行，这促进了氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv通常导致较低的催化活性和氧化能力，因为需要更多的能量来形成氧空位，这可能阻碍反应动力学。相反，较低的ΔEv允许更容易地形成氧空位，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制对于理解和优化氧化反应中氧化物催化剂的性能至关重要。
