The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of oxide catalysts. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically lead to decreased catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as they make it energetically more demanding for reactants to adsorb and undergo oxidation reactions. Conversely, lower ΔEv values facilitate easier adsorption and oxidation, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过表面氧化物催化剂上的氧空位形成来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较高的ΔEv值通常导致催化活性和氧化能力降低，因为它们使反应物吸附和发生氧化反应变得更具能垒。相反，较低的ΔEv值使吸附和氧化更容易进行，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

[1] "Oxygen uptake/release from nanocrystalline ceria measured by thermogravimetric techniques under the conditions of interest for this study is found to be mainly due to surface nonstoichiometry rather than to bulk nonstoichiometry or molecular oxygen adsorption/desorption on the surface."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Under the conditions of interest for this study, the measurement of oxygen uptake/release from nanocrystalline ceria using thermogravimetric techniques primarily attributes this process to surface nonstoichiometry. This means that the primary cause of oxygen absorption or release is not due to bulk nonstoichiometry or the adsorption/desorption of molecular oxygen on the surface.

对于本研究中感兴趣的条件，使用热重分析技术测量纳米晶铈的氧摄取/释放主要归因于表面非等比性。这意味着氧气吸收或释放的主要原因不是由于内部非等比性或表面分子氧的吸附/脱附。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The measured oxygen partial pressure dependencies of nonstoichiometry, ranging from 0 to )1/2, for variously prepared nanocrystalline ceria powders can be explained by the coexistence of differently charged oxygen vacancies alongside charged impurities segregated onto the surface. These charged oxygen vacancies and impurities contribute to the observed oxygen nonstoichiometry behavior under different oxygen pressures.

对于不同制备方法的纳米晶铈粉末，测量到的氧分压依赖性非等比性，从0变化到)1/2，可以由表面存在的不同电荷状态的氧空位与表面分层的带电杂质共存来解释。这些带电氧空位和杂质共同决定了在不同氧分压下观察到的氧非等比行为。
