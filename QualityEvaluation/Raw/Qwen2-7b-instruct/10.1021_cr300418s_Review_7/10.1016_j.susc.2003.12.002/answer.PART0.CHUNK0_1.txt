[1] "The measured oxygen partial pressure dependencies of nonstoichiometry, varying from 0 to )1/2, for differently prepared nanocrystalline ceria powders can be explained by the presence of differently charged oxygen vacancies in addition to charged impurities segregated onto the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies allow for the adsorption of reactant molecules, facilitating the transfer of electrons and promoting the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more energetically favorable process, enhancing the catalyst's performance by enabling faster and more efficient oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位的形成和迁移来运作。这些空位允许反应物分子的吸附，促进电子转移并促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明一个更有利于的能量过程，通过加快并提高氧化反应的效率来增强催化剂的性能。
