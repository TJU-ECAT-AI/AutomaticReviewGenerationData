[1] "The results described in this paper clearly demonstrate that the thermodynamic properties associated with high- surface-area ceria samples are different from that of bulk ceria."
[2] "On the other hand, the addition of +3 dopants into ceria does not appear to influence the redox properties of ceria substantially."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption and oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, leading to a higher density of active sites and thus increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

[1] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."
[2] "The results show that thermodynamic data for bulk compounds may not be relevant for catalytic applications and point out the need for obtaining thermodynamic information on catalytically relevant materials."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) for the oxygen atom to leave the surface and participate in the reaction. The energy required for this process, ΔEv, plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher ability of the surface to release oxygen, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."
[2] "While thermodynamic data clearly do not answer all questions about ceria catalysis, they do provide an impor- tant starting point for understanding reaction mechanisms on oxide catalysts. As shown by the previous results for cer- iazirconia solid solutions and the new data for high-sur- face-area ceria, data on bulk compounds that are reported in standard handbooks are not always applicable to catalyt- ically interesting materials."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, which enhances the surface's ability to release oxygen under reaction conditions. This, in turn, increases the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Thermodynamic data, as presented in the study, reveal that the redox properties of ceria surfaces differ significantly from those of bulk ceria, with the oxidation enthalpies being notably lower at the surface, affecting the material's ability to release oxygen under reaction conditions.

[1] "While the surface area of pure ceria was found to be unstable under redox conditions, the extent of reduction at 873 K and a P(O2) of 1.6 × 10^26 atm increased with surface area."
[2] "Because ceria/LA samples were stable, equilibrium isotherms were determined between 873 and 973 K on a 30-wt% ceria sample."
[3] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."
[4] "To determine whether +3 dopants could affect the oxi- dation enthalpies for ceria, isotherms were measured for Sm+3-doped ceria (SDC) and Y+3-doped ceria."
[5] "These dopants were found to remove the phase transition observed in pure ceria below 973 K but appeared to have minimal effect on the oxidation enthalpies."
[6] "The question arises as to why the thermodynamics of reduction should be different for nano-particles or other low-temperature forms of ceria."
[7] "For example, the reduced species could remain in a cubic CeO(2x) form rather than going to the hexagonal Ce2O3; at least some of the energy of reduction of bulk ceria is associated with structural changes."
[8] "Another possibility is that surface effects could play a role. Indeed, the work by Kim et al. mentioned earlier [24], correlated oxygen uptake and release with the surface area of nano-particles."
[9] "The oxidation enthalpies for ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."
