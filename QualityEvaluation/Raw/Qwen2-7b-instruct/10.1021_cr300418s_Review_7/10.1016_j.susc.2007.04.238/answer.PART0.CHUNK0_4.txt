[1] "While the surface area of pure ceria was found to be unstable under redox conditions, the extent of reduction at 873 K and a P(O2) of 1.6 × 10^26 atm increased with surface area."
[2] "Because ceria/LA samples were stable, equilibrium isotherms were determined between 873 and 973 K on a 30-wt% ceria sample."
[3] "Oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA were found to vary with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents of reduction to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents."
[4] "To determine whether +3 dopants could affect the oxi- dation enthalpies for ceria, isotherms were measured for Sm+3-doped ceria (SDC) and Y+3-doped ceria."
[5] "These dopants were found to remove the phase transition observed in pure ceria below 973 K but appeared to have minimal effect on the oxidation enthalpies."
[6] "The question arises as to why the thermodynamics of reduction should be different for nano-particles or other low-temperature forms of ceria."
[7] "For example, the reduced species could remain in a cubic CeO(2x) form rather than going to the hexagonal Ce2O3; at least some of the energy of reduction of bulk ceria is associated with structural changes."
[8] "Another possibility is that surface effects could play a role. Indeed, the work by Kim et al. mentioned earlier [24], correlated oxygen uptake and release with the surface area of nano-particles."
[9] "The oxidation enthalpies for ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."

1. The extent of reduction of ceria at 873 K and a P(O2) of 1.6 × 10^26 atm increased with surface area, while the surface area of pure ceria was unstable under redox conditions.
2. The stability of ceria/LA samples allowed for the determination of equilibrium isotherms between 873 and 973 K.
3. The oxidation enthalpies on ceria/LA varied with the extent of reduction, ranging from 500 kJ/mol O2 at low extents to near the bulk value of 760 kJ/mol O2 at higher extents.
4. The introduction of +3 dopants did not significantly affect the oxidation enthalpies of ceria.
5. The thermodynamics of reduction for ceria nano-particles or low-temperature forms may differ from bulk ceria due to structural and surface effects.
6. The reduced species in ceria could remain in a cubic CeO(2x) form, leading to structural changes during reduction.
7. Surface area correlates with oxygen uptake and release in nanoscale ceria, as demonstrated by Kim et al.'s work.
8. The thermodynamics of ceria surfaces show significant differences from bulk ceria, with oxidation enthalpies being notably lower at the surface, impacting the material's ability to release oxygen under reaction conditions.

1. 在873 K和P(O2)为1.6×10^26 atm的情况下，纯铈表面的还原度随着表面积的增加而增加，而纯铈表面在氧化还原条件下不稳定。
2. 由于ceria/LA样品稳定，因此可以在873至973 K之间确定平衡等温线。
3. ceria/LA上的氧化热能随还原程度变化，从低程度的500 kJ/mol O2到更高程度接近760 kJ/mol O2的值。
4. +3掺杂剂对铈的氧化热能影响不大。
5. ceria纳米颗粒或低温形式的氧化动力学可能与纯铈不同，这可能是由于结构和表面效应。
6. ceria中的还原物种可以保持在立方体CeO(2x)形式，导致在还原过程中发生结构变化。
7. Kim等人研究中表明，纳米尺度铈的表面积与氧的吸收和释放相关联。
8. ceria表面的热力学性质与纯铈有很大差异，表面的氧化热能明显低于表面，影响材料在反应条件下的氧气释放能力。
