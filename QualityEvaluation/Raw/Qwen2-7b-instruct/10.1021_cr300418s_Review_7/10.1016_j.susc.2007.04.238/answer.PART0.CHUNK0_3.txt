[1] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."
[2] "While thermodynamic data clearly do not answer all questions about ceria catalysis, they do provide an impor- tant starting point for understanding reaction mechanisms on oxide catalysts. As shown by the previous results for cer- iazirconia solid solutions and the new data for high-sur- face-area ceria, data on bulk compounds that are reported in standard handbooks are not always applicable to catalyt- ically interesting materials."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, which enhances the surface's ability to release oxygen under reaction conditions. This, in turn, increases the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Thermodynamic data, as presented in the study, reveal that the redox properties of ceria surfaces differ significantly from those of bulk ceria, with the oxidation enthalpies being notably lower at the surface, affecting the material's ability to release oxygen under reaction conditions.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧化物中的氧空位（Ov）的形成而运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，从而增强了表面释放氧气的能力，在反应条件下。这反过来增加了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。研究中提供的热力学数据揭示了铈亚表面与基体铈的红氧化性质存在显著差异，表面的氧化焓明显低于基体，影响材料在反应条件下释放氧气的能力。
