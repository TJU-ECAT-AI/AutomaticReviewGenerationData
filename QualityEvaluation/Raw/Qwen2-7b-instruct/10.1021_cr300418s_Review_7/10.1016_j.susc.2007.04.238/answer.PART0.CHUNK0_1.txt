[1] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."
[2] "The results show that thermodynamic data for bulk compounds may not be relevant for catalytic applications and point out the need for obtaining thermodynamic information on catalytically relevant materials."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) for the oxygen atom to leave the surface and participate in the reaction. The energy required for this process, ΔEv, plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher ability of the surface to release oxygen, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过要求形成氧空位（ΔEv）来释放表面的氧原子并参与反应。这个过程所需的能量，ΔEv，在确定催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明表面释放氧气的能力更强，从而增强催化活性和氧化能力。
