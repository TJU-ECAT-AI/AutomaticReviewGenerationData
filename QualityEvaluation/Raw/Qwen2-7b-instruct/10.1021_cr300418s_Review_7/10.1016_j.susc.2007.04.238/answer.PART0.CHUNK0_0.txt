[1] "The results described in this paper clearly demonstrate that the thermodynamic properties associated with high- surface-area ceria samples are different from that of bulk ceria."
[2] "On the other hand, the addition of +3 dopants into ceria does not appear to influence the redox properties of ceria substantially."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption and oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, leading to a higher density of active sites and thus increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧空位的形成而运作。这些空位作为吸附和氧化反应物的活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，导致活性位点密度更高，从而增加催化活性和氧化能力。
