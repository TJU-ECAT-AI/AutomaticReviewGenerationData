The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for this process determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv leads to more stable oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

[1] "The thermodynamic redox properties of ceria surfaces appear to differ significantly from that of bulk ceria. The magnitude of the oxidation enthalpies can be more than 200 kJ/mole O2 lower at the surface, strongly affecting the ability of the material to release oxygen under reaction conditions."
