[1] "An important feature of the alpha-quartz structure is the structure of the SiO, groups, as shown in Fig. 1. These groups are only approximately tetrahedral, the local symmetry at the silicon being C,. The Si-0 bonds thus are of two types, differing in bond length. The equilibrium distances are
1.6145A (e.g., Si(0)-O(3)) and 1.6101 A (e.g., Si(0)-O(2)) at 94 K, giving rise to the terms "long-bonded" and "short-bonded" oxygens, respectively, when considering the environment of a specific silicon. Of course, each oxygen is bonded to two silicons and has one long and one short bond."

1. The alpha-quartz structure features SiO, groups that are roughly tetrahedral with silicon exhibiting local C symmetry. The Si-O bonds come in two types, with bond lengths of 1.6145A and 1.6101A at 94K, leading to designations of "long-bonded" and "short-bonded" oxygens based on their proximity to a specific silicon atom. Each oxygen is connected to two silicon atoms, with one long bond and one short bond.

1. 阿尔法石英结构中的SiO,组分大致呈四面体结构，硅原子局部具有C对称性。Si-O键分为两种类型，94K时键长分别为1.6145A和1.6101A，导致特定硅原子周围出现“长键氧”和“短键氧”的术语。每个氧原子与两个硅原子相连，形成一个长键和一个短键。

[1] "In an attempt to estimate the magnetic dipole-dipole contributions to AAl and As,, a computer program ADMAT was written, which approximates the electron orbital as a grid of points (typically ca. 2000) with associated probabilities determined from screened hydrogenic wavefunctions (58)."
