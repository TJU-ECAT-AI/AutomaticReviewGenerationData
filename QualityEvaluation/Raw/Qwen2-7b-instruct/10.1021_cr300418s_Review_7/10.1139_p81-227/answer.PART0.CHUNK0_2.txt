The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO4I0] exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al (I = 5/2, 100% abundance). Simulated stick spectra calculated by Griffiths et al. using their reported spin- Hamiltonian gave relatively satisfactory agreement with their experimental spectra (4). Based on the "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along a Si-O direction, and on the smallness of the hyperfine interaction, they postulated that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum.

The most prominent paramagnetic impurity center in single crystal alpha-quartz exposed to X-rays at room temperature is [AlO4]0, which contains an aluminum ion substituted for a silicon ion, with an electron removed from an adjacent oxygen by the ionizing radiation. This species was first studied by Griffiths et al. using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and interpreted by O'Brien and Pryce and by O'Brien. It is formed during irradiation by gamma-rays, X-rays, electrons, or neutrons and can also be created electrolytically. The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO4]0 exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al (I = 5/2, 100% abundance). The "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along a Si-O direction, and the smallness of the hyperfine interaction led to the hypothesis that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum.

在室温下，暴露于X射线的单晶α石英中最突出的顺磁杂质中心是[AlO4]0，其中包含一个取代硅离子的铝离子，从相邻的氧原子中去除了一个电子。由Griffiths等人使用电子自旋共振（EPR）并由O'Brien和Pryce以及O'Brien进行解释。它是在伽玛射线、X射线、电子或中子照射下形成的，并且也可以通过电解产生。X波段EPR谱图的[AlO4]0显示出来自Z7Al（I = 5/2，100％丰度）的复杂核精细结构。沿着Si-Si方向的“独特”主方向g，沿着Si-O方向的铝核四极矩方向以及微弱的核精细相互作用导致推测一个电子空穴被困在一个连接两个硅原子的氧阴离子的非共价p轨道中，其中一个硅阳离子被铝取代。
