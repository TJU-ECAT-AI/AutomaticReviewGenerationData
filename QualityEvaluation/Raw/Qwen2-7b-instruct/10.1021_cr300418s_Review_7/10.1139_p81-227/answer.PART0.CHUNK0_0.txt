[I. Introduction] "The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO,I0] exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al (I = 512, 100% abundance). Simulated stick spectra calculated by Griffiths et al. using their reported spin- Hamiltonian gave relatively satisfactory agreement with their experimental spectra (4). Based on the "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along a Si-0 direction, and on the smallness of the hyperfine interaction, they postulated that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum."

[IV. Results and Analysis] "The center is stable for years at room temperature. In most samples studied, irradiation at 77 K and observation at low temperature without allowing the crystal to warm up significantly yielded a spectrum with signals due to one or more of the "compensated" aluminum hole centers, [AI04/H+]+, where M+ is a cation such as H+, Li+, or Na+. (.These centers yield [A104]0 on warm-up to room temperature.)"

[V. Discussion] "We turn to the question of the relationship of the principal magnetic directions as measured by EPR to the structural directions found by X-ray diffrac- tion in cr-quartz. Because of the lack of symmetry elements (e.g., not even C 2 occurs), no principal axes need necessarily agree with atom-atom direc- tions or other st]-uctural features. In addition,distortions at the defect centers could cause devia- tions from directions defined by the atom positions in the perfect structure."

The electron hole in the [AlO,I0] center is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion connecting two silicon sites, with a silicon ion substituted by aluminum. This is deduced from the unique principal directions of the g matrix along the Si-Si direction and the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along the Si-O direction, combined with the small hyperfine interaction. 

In most samples, irradiation at 77 K followed by low temperature observation resulted in a spectrum with signals from compensated aluminum hole centers, which transform into [AlO4]0 upon warming to room temperature. 

The relationship between the principal magnetic directions measured by EPR and the structural directions found by X-ray diffraction in quartz is complicated due to the lack of symmetry elements and possible distortions at the defect centers. The principal axes might not align with atom-atom directions or other structural features.

在[AlO,I0]中心，电子空穴被囚禁在一个连接两个硅原子的氧原子非共价p轨道中，其中一个硅离子被铝取代。这是根据g矩阵沿Si-Si方向的独特主方向和铝核四极矩方向沿Si-O方向，结合微弱的精细结构相互作用得出的结论。

在大多数样品中，77 K下的辐射处理后，在低温下观察到的光谱显示信号来自于补偿的铝空穴中心，这些中心在加热至室温时转化为[AlO4]0。

EPR测量的主磁方向与通过X射线衍射在石英中找到的结构方向之间的关系复杂。由于缺乏对称元素以及可能的缺陷中心畸变，主轴可能不会与原子-原子方向或其它结构特征对齐。
