[I. Introduction] "The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO,I0] exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al (I = 512, 100% abundance). Simulated stick spectra calculated by Griffiths et al. using their reported spin- Hamiltonian gave relatively satisfactory agreement with their experimental spectra (4). Based on the "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along a Si-0 direction, and on the smallness of the hyperfine interaction, they postulated that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum."

[IV. Results and Analysis] "The center is stable for years at room temperature. In most samples studied, irradiation at 77 K and observation at low temperature without allowing the crystal to warm up significantly yielded a spectrum with signals due to one or more of the "compensated" aluminum hole centers, [AI04/H+]+, where M+ is a cation such as H+, Li+, or Na+. (.These centers yield [A104]0 on warm-up to room temperature.)"

[V. Discussion] "We turn to the question of the relationship of the principal magnetic directions as measured by EPR to the structural directions found by X-ray diffrac- tion in cr-quartz. Because of the lack of symmetry elements (e.g., not even C 2 occurs), no principal axes need necessarily agree with atom-atom direc- tions or other st]-uctural features. In addition,distortions at the defect centers could cause devia- tions from directions defined by the atom positions in the perfect structure."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The electron hole in the [AlO,I0] center is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion connecting two silicon sites, with a silicon ion substituted by aluminum. This is deduced from the unique principal directions of the g matrix along the Si-Si direction and the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along the Si-O direction, combined with the small hyperfine interaction. 

In most samples, irradiation at 77 K followed by low temperature observation resulted in a spectrum with signals from compensated aluminum hole centers, which transform into [AlO4]0 upon warming to room temperature. 

The relationship between the principal magnetic directions measured by EPR and the structural directions found by X-ray diffraction in quartz is complicated due to the lack of symmetry elements and possible distortions at the defect centers. The principal axes might not align with atom-atom directions or other structural features.

在[AlO,I0]中心，电子空穴被囚禁在一个连接两个硅原子的氧原子非共价p轨道中，其中一个硅离子被铝取代。这是根据g矩阵沿Si-Si方向的独特主方向和铝核四极矩方向沿Si-O方向，结合微弱的精细结构相互作用得出的结论。

在大多数样品中，77 K下的辐射处理后，在低温下观察到的光谱显示信号来自于补偿的铝空穴中心，这些中心在加热至室温时转化为[AlO4]0。

EPR测量的主磁方向与通过X射线衍射在石英中找到的结构方向之间的关系复杂。由于缺乏对称元素以及可能的缺陷中心畸变，主轴可能不会与原子-原子方向或其它结构特征对齐。

The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO4I0] exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al (I = 5/2, 100% abundance). Simulated stick spectra calculated by Griffiths et al. using their reported spin- Hamiltonian gave relatively satisfactory agreement with their experimental spectra (4). Based on the "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along a Si-O direction, and on the smallness of the hyperfine interaction, they postulated that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum.

The EPR spectra of [AlO4I0] show complex hyperfine structure originating from the 77Al nucleus. The hyperfine interaction was modeled using a spin-Hamiltonian framework proposed by Griffiths et al., which matched the experimental spectra reasonably well. They deduced that the electron hole is captured in a non-bonding p-orbital of an oxygen atom that links two silicon sites, with one silicon ion being substituted by aluminum.

The spin-Hamiltonian parameters have now been redetermined and extended to include "0 and ?'Si hyperfine matrices. One goal is to provide accurate spin-Hamiltonian data to enable understanding of the local distortions at the [A104]0 complex. Low temperature structural data for quartz have recently become available (16, 17) for comparison with the EPR data. Another goal is to remove discrepancies and confusions existing in the literature. as well as to provide reliable data for comparison between [A104]0,and the closely related centers [AIO,/M+]+ (18, 19) and [AlO,]+ (20-22).

The most prominent paramagnetic impurity center in single crystal alpha-quartz exposed to X-rays at room temperature is [AlO4]0, which contains an aluminum ion substituted for a silicon ion, with an electron removed from an adjacent oxygen by the ionizing radiation. This species was first studied by Griffiths et al. using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and interpreted by O'Brien and Pryce and by O'Brien. It is formed during irradiation by gamma-rays, X-rays, electrons, or neutrons and can also be created electrolytically. The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO4]0 exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al (I = 5/2, 100% abundance). The "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along a Si-O direction, and the smallness of the hyperfine interaction led to the hypothesis that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum.

[I. Introduction]
Aluminum, which substitutes for silicon in crystalline quartz, is contained in various radiation-induced trapped-hole species. This field has been recently reviewed (1, 2). The most prominent center, [AlO,I0, was first studied by Griffiths et al. (3,4) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and interpreted by O'Brien and Pryce (5) and by O'Brien (6).

[II. Symmetry and Crystal Structure of a-Quartz]
Alpha-quartz exists in two enantiomorphic forms (left- and right-quartz) having structures which belong to trigonal space groups. This situation has given rise to considerable confusion (and often error!) in the literature through the choice by various researchers of different conventions for the description of quartz properties, often presented without adequate documentation.

[IV. Results and Analysis]
A. Experitnental Observations  
Data The EPR spectrum of [A104]0 has been observed in every sample studied in our laboratory at low temperature (ca. 35 K, herein) after X-irradiation at room temperature, or at 77K with subsequent warming to room temperature before observation.

[B. Determination of Spin-Hanziltonian Parctnetrr]
Mcltrices fiotrn EPR Data The EPR observations of [AIO4l0 are expressed in terms of a spin-Hamiltonian of the form

[C. Cotnparison with Previously Available Spin-Hamiltonian Parameters]
It will herein be considered as proved that the EPR signals studied arise from a center in which an aluminum ion has substituted for a silicon cation in the lattice, and in which an electron hole has been trapped, primarily located at a neighboring oxygen anion.

[V. Discussion]
We turn to the question of the relationship of the principal magnetic directions as measured by EPR to the structural directions found by X-ray diffrac- tion in cr-quartz. Because of the lack of symmetry elements (e.g., not even C 2 occurs), no principal axes need necessarily agree with atom-atom direc- tions or other st]-uctural features.

The literature discusses the substitution of aluminum for silicon in crystalline quartz, leading to the formation of various radiation-induced trapped-hole species, with the prominent [AlO4I0 center being extensively studied. The structure of alpha-quartz, being enantiomorphic, has led to confusion in the literature due to differing conventions for describing its properties. The EPR spectrum of [AlO4I0 has been observed at low temperatures after X-irradiation. The relationship between the principal magnetic directions measured by EPR and the structural directions in quartz is also discussed, acknowledging the lack of symmetry elements that might align these directions.

[1] "An important feature of the alpha-quartz structure is the structure of the SiO, groups, as shown in Fig. 1. These groups are only approximately tetrahedral, the local symmetry at the silicon being C,. The Si-0 bonds thus are of two types, differing in bond length. The equilibrium distances are
1.6145A (e.g., Si(0)-O(3)) and 1.6101 A (e.g., Si(0)-O(2)) at 94 K, giving rise to the terms "long-bonded" and "short-bonded" oxygens, respectively, when considering the environment of a specific silicon. Of course, each oxygen is bonded to two silicons and has one long and one short bond."

1. The alpha-quartz structure features SiO, groups that are roughly tetrahedral with silicon exhibiting local C symmetry. The Si-O bonds come in two types, with bond lengths of 1.6145A and 1.6101A at 94K, leading to designations of "long-bonded" and "short-bonded" oxygens based on their proximity to a specific silicon atom.
