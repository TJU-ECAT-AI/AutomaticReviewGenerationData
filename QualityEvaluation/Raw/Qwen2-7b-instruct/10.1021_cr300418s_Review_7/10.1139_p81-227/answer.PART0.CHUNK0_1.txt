The X-band EPR spectra of [AlO4I0] exhibit complex hyperfine structure from Z7Al (I = 5/2, 100% abundance). Simulated stick spectra calculated by Griffiths et al. using their reported spin- Hamiltonian gave relatively satisfactory agreement with their experimental spectra (4). Based on the "unique" principal direction of g along a Si-Si direction, the aluminum nuclear quadrupole direction along a Si-O direction, and on the smallness of the hyperfine interaction, they postulated that an electron hole is trapped in a nonbonding p-orbital of an oxygen anion linking two silicon sites, with one of the silicon cations replaced by aluminum.

The EPR spectra of [AlO4I0] show complex hyperfine structure originating from the 77Al nucleus. The hyperfine interaction was modeled using a spin-Hamiltonian framework proposed by Griffiths et al., which matched the experimental spectra reasonably well. They deduced that the electron hole is captured in a non-bonding p-orbital of an oxygen atom that links two silicon sites, with one silicon ion being substituted by aluminum.

[AlO4I0]的EPR谱图显示出复杂的精细结构，源自于77Al核。通过Griffiths等人提出的自旋哈密顿量框架建模，实验谱图与之匹配良好。他们推断电子空位被捕获在一个连接两个硅原子的氧原子的非共价p轨道中，其中一个硅离子被铝取代。

The spin-Hamiltonian parameters have now been redetermined and extended to include "0 and ?'Si hyperfine matrices. One goal is to provide accurate spin-Hamiltonian data to enable understanding of the local distortions at the [A104]0 complex. Low temperature structural data for quartz have recently become available (16, 17) for comparison with the EPR data. Another goal is to remove discrepancies and confusions existing in the literature. as well as to provide reliable data for comparison between [A104]0,and the closely related centers [AIO,/M+]+ (18, 19) and [AlO,]+ (20-22).

The spin-Hamiltonian parameters have been recalculated and expanded to incorporate hyperfine matrices for "0 and ?'Si. The aim is to furnish precise spin-Hamiltonian information to elucidate the local distortions within the [A104]0 complex. Recently, low-temperature structural data for quartz (16, 17) are accessible for juxtaposition with the EPR data. Additionally, the objective is to address inconsistencies and ambiguities in the literature, and to offer dependable data for contrast with [A104]0, as well as its closely related centers [AIO,/M+]+ (18, 19) and [AlO,]+ (20-22).
