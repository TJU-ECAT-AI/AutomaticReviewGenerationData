[I. Introduction]
Aluminum, which substitutes for silicon in crystalline quartz, is contained in various radiation-induced trapped-hole species. This field has been recently reviewed (1, 2). The most prominent center, [AlO,I0, was first studied by Griffiths et al. (3,4) using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and interpreted by O'Brien and Pryce (5) and by O'Brien (6).

[II. Symmetry and Crystal Structure of a-Quartz]
Alpha-quartz exists in two enantiomorphic forms (left- and right-quartz) having structures which belong to trigonal space groups. This situation has given rise to considerable confusion (and often error!) in the literature through the choice by various researchers of different conventions for the description of quartz properties, often presented without adequate documentation.

[IV. Results and Analysis]
A. Experitnental Observations  
Data The EPR spectrum of [A104]0 has been observed in every sample studied in our laboratory at low temperature (ca. 35 K, herein) after X-irradiation at room temperature, or at 77K with subsequent warming to room temperature before observation.

[B. Determination of Spin-Hanziltonian Parctnetrr]
Mcltrices fiotrn EPR Data The EPR observations of [AIO4l0 are expressed in terms of a spin-Hamiltonian of the form

[C. Cotnparison with Previously Available Spin-Hamiltonian Parameters]
It will herein be considered as proved that the EPR signals studied arise from a center in which an aluminum ion has substituted for a silicon cation in the lattice, and in which an electron hole has been trapped, primarily located at a neighboring oxygen anion.

[V. Discussion]
We turn to the question of the relationship of the principal magnetic directions as measured by EPR to the structural directions found by X-ray diffrac- tion in cr-quartz. Because of the lack of symmetry elements (e.g., not even C 2 occurs), no principal axes need necessarily agree with atom-atom direc- tions or other st]-uctural features.

The literature discusses the substitution of aluminum for silicon in crystalline quartz, leading to the formation of various radiation-induced trapped-hole species, with the prominent [AlO4I0 center being extensively studied. The structure of alpha-quartz, being enantiomorphic, has led to confusion in the literature due to differing conventions for describing its properties. The EPR spectrum of [AlO4I0 has been observed at low temperatures after X-irradiation. The relationship between the principal magnetic directions measured by EPR and the structural directions in quartz is also discussed, acknowledging the lack of symmetry elements that might align these directions.
