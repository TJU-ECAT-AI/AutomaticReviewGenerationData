The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an oxygen vacancy forms, it creates a site for additional oxygen atoms to bind, enhancing the surface's capacity to oxidize substrates. The energy associated with this process (ΔEv) influences the stability of the oxide surface and the ease with which it can accept oxygen atoms, thereby affecting its catalytic performance and oxidizing power.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）在氧化物表面操作。氧空位形成的能量对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当形成氧空位时，它会在表面创建一个额外的氧原子结合的站点，从而增强表面氧化底物的能力。这个过程（ΔEv）相关的能量影响表面的稳定性以及它接受氧原子的便利性，进而影响其催化性能和氧化能力。
