The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for this process, ΔEv, plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, facilitating faster and more efficient oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过要求在氧化物催化剂表面上形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运行。这个过程所需的能量，ΔEv，在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，从而促进更快、更高效的氧化反应。
