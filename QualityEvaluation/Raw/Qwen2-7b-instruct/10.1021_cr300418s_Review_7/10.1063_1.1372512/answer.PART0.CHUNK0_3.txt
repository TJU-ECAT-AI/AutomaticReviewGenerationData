[1] "Dissociative adsorption is one of the most important reactions in catalysis. In this communication we propose a model aiming to generalize the important factors that affect dissociation reactions."
[2] "For any co-adsorption system of two adsorbates, say A and B, the total chemisorption energy of A and B, EA1B ,can be written"
[3] "The lowest energy TSs for CO dissociation on different transition metal surfaces have been shown in Fig. 2 and their structural parameters are listed in Table I."
[4] "It can be seen that Ea dis vary considerably from 0.55 to 2.21 eV on these metals Table II!"
[5] "As can be seen in Table II, on going from left to right in 5d metals of the periodic table, Ea as increases just in contrast to SEX FS ."
[6] "In other words, to a large extent the dissociation reaction barrier is determined by the FS atomic chemisorption energy for these systems."

1. Dissociative adsorption is a critical process in catalysis. The authors propose a model to elucidate the key factors influencing dissociation reactions. 
2. The total chemisorption energy of two adsorbates A and B can be represented as EA1B.  
3. The lowest energy transition states (TS) for CO dissociation on various transition metal surfaces are depicted in Figure 2, and their parameters are outlined in Table I.
4. The dissociation barriers (Ea dis) for CO on these metals range significantly, from 0.55 to 2.21 eV.
5. As moving from left to right across the 5d transition metals in the periodic table, the association barrier (Ea as) increases in contrast to the FS atomic chemisorption energy (SEX FS).
6. The dissociation reaction barrier is largely influenced by the FS atomic chemisorption energy in these systems.
