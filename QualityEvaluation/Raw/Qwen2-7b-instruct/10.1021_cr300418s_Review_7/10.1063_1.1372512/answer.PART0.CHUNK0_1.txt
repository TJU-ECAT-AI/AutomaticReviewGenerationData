[1] "Dissociative adsorption is one of the most important reactions in catalysis."
[2] "It is the first step and often the rate-determining step in many catalytic processes."
[3] "We propose a model aiming to generalize the important factors that affect dissociation reactions."
[4] "The model connects the dissociation barrier with the association barrier, the chemisorption energies of A and B at the final state and the bonding energy of AB in the gas phase."
[5] "We have calculated CO dissociation on Ru0001!, Rh111!, Pd111!, Os0001!, Ir111!, and Pt111! using density function theory DFT!"
[6] "The lowest energy TSs for CO dissociation on different transition metal surfaces have been shown in Fig. 2 and their structural parameters are listed in Table I."
[7] "It can be seen that Ea dis vary considerably from 0.55 to 2.21 eV on these metals Table II!"
[8] "For 4d metals, we obtain Ea dis520.98SEX FS112.98 while for 5d it is Ea dis521.35SEX FS117.30."
[9] "As can be seen in Table II, on going from left to right in 5d metals of the periodic table, Ea as increases just in contrast to SEX FS."
[10] "In fact, even for 4d metals Ea as is not constant either."
[11] "This is consistent with the empirical Bronsted Polanyi relationship, which indicates the change in reaction barrier can be correlated with the change in the heat of reaction as long as the reaction mechanism is unchanged."
[12] "What is not apparent is whether a dissociation reaction should be a nonactivated one no dissociation barrier! or an activated one and whether a dissociation reaction should occur through the precursor-mediated mechanism molecules adsorb molecularly first and then dissociate!"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv typically indicates a more stable oxide surface, which can lead to better catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the enhanced reactivity of the oxygen vacancies. However, if the ΔEv is too high, it may hinder the diffusion of reactants and products, potentially reducing the catalytic efficiency.

火星-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧化物的氧空位（ΔEv）的形成而运作。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较高的ΔEv通常意味着更稳定的氧化物表面，这可以导致更好的催化活性和氧化能力，因为增强了氧空位的反应性。然而，如果ΔEv太高，它可能会阻碍反应物和产物的扩散，可能降低催化效率。
