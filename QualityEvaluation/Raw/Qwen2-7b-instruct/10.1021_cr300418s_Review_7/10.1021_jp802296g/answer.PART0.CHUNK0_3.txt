[4] "The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
[5] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
[6] "We find that all the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the oxide surface binding oxygen atoms to form oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, a lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity, as it signifies an easier formation of oxygen vacancies. This, in turn, enhances the oxide's ability to oxidize reactants efficiently, making it a better oxidant and catalyst. The linearity between ΔEv and key reaction energies supports ΔEv as a reliable descriptor of the catalytic properties in oxide-catalyzed oxidation processes.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面吸附氧原子形成氧空位，从而促进反应物的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化剂活性和氧化能力起着关键作用。具体来说，ΔEv越低表示氧化空位更容易形成，这增强了氧化物的氧化效率，使之成为更好的氧化剂和催化剂。ΔEv与关键反应能量之间的线性关系支持其作为氧化物催化氧化过程催化性质可靠描述符的角色。
