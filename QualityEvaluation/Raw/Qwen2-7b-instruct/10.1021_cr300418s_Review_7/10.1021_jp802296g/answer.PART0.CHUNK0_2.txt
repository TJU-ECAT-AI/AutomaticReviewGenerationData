[1] "The formation and the annihilation of the oxygen vacancies are critical steps in this Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, and this suggests that the energy of vacancy formation (ΔEv) might be a good descriptor of the catalytic properties of doped oxides."
[2] "We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W)."
[3] "Therefore, such a doped oxide is a better oxidant than the undoped one, and it is more likely to engage in an oxidation reaction by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in which a surface oxygen atom oxidizes a reagent and is removed from the surface leaving behind an oxygen vacancy."
[4] "The only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another are the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decaying linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, and the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy being a linear function of ΔEv."
[5] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
[6] "In deciding which intermediate reactions are most likely from an energetic point of view, we impose a spin conservation rule: a reaction that requires flipping a spin is too slow for catalysis."
[7] "In the case of CO oxidation by rutile AuxTi1xO2 (110), we found that O2 adsorbs at the oxygen vacancy site and that its OO bond is weakened by contact with the electron rich vacancy."
[8] "In the case of CO oxidation on (VO)xTi1xO2 (110), the lowest energy state of (VO)xTi1xO2 (110) is a doublet."
[9] "In the case of CO oxidation by (CrO)xTi1xO2 (110), (MoO)xTi1xO2 (110), and (WO)xTi1xO2 (110), the reaction energies for these catalytic surfaces are given in Table 4."
[10] "In the case of reaction 2 one would expect that if it is hard to make an oxygen vacancy then it is hard to desorb CO2."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves an oxygen atom from the surface oxidizing a reagent and then being removed from the surface to create an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

2. The presence of dopants such as V, Cr, Mo, and W allows the oxide surface to bind an oxygen atom, making the oxide a better oxidant and more likely to engage in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

3. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom and the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy vary depending on ΔEv, suggesting that ΔEv can be a good descriptor of catalytic activity.

4. The spin conservation rule is applied to exclude reactions that require spin flipping, as they are too slow for catalysis. 

5. In CO oxidation, O2 adsorbs at the oxygen vacancy site and its OO bond is weakened, facilitating the reaction.

6. For CO oxidation on (VO)xTi1xO2 (110), the lowest energy state of the oxide is a doublet.

7. For CO oxidation on (CrO)xTi1xO2 (110), (MoO)xTi1xO2 (110), and (WO)xTi1xO2 (110), specific reaction energies are provided in Table 4.

8. It is expected that making an oxygen vacancy hard would also make desorbing CO2 hard, but the calculations show no such correlation.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中的马森-范克雷维尔机制中，表面的氧原子会氧化反应物并从表面上移除，留下一个氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

2. 磷酸盐的存在使得氧化物表面能够结合氧原子，从而使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，并更有可能参与马森-范克雷维尔机制。

3. 在马森-范克雷维尔机制中，表面的氧原子与CO反应的能量和吸附O2到空位的能量都依赖于ΔEv，表明ΔEv可以作为催化剂活性的描述符。

4. 应用自旋守恒规则排除需要翻转自旋的反应，因为这些反应的速率太慢不适合催化。

5. 在CO氧化过程中，O2在氧空位处吸附并且其OO键被电子丰富的空位削弱，促进了反应。

6. 对于(VO)xTi1xO2 (110)，最低能量状态的氧化物是二重态。

7. 对于(CrO)xTi1xO2 (110)，(MoO)xTi1xO2 (110)和(WO)xTi1xO2 (110)，特定的反应能量在表4中给出。

8. 预期如果难以形成氧空位，则脱除CO2也会困难，但计算结果显示没有这样的相关性。
