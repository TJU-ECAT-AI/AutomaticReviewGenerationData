[1] "In the presence of gas phase oxygen all dopants, except Mn, bind an oxygen atom; therefore, the dopant is a MO group (M = V, Cr, Mo, or W)."
[2] "On the basis of previous work we have assumed (and the present calculations confirm) that the dopant does not directly participate in the oxidation reaction; its role is to change the binding energy of the oxygen atoms in the surface layer to the oxide."
[3] "We find that, indeed, it is; the energies E1 and E3 (for steps 1 and 3) are linear functions of the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy at b2 (see Figure 7)."
[4] "The three energies that change from one catalyst to another (the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation) are related by two linear relations."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of one oxygen atom from the surface to a reactant. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its role as a descriptor of both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a more efficient oxide in generating oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for the mechanism to proceed.

2. The dopants, such as V, Cr, Mo, and W, do not directly participate in the oxidation reaction itself. Instead, they alter the binding energy of the oxygen atoms on the surface layer to the oxide, making the oxide a better oxidant but less active in the oxidation process. This alteration facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the oxide's catalytic properties.

3. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in determining the catalytic activity of the oxide surface. It correlates linearly with the energy of the CO reaction with surface oxygen (E1) and the energy of O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy (E3), indicating that the ease of forming an oxygen vacancy is directly linked to the catalytic efficiency of the oxide.

4. The three critical energies involved in the catalytic cycle—the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation—are interconnected by linear relationships. This implies that these three energies can serve as reliable descriptors of the catalytic activity of the oxide surface in oxidation reactions.

1. 马斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过使表面的氧原子转移到反应物上来实现的。形成氧空位的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物更有效地生成氧空位，这对机制的进行至关重要。

2. V、Cr、Mo、W等掺杂剂不直接参与氧化反应。相反，它们改变表面层中氧原子与氧化物的结合能，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂但活性降低。这种改变促进了氧空位的形成，增强了氧化物的催化性能。

3. 氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性的关键因素。它与表面氧与CO反应的能量（E1）和吸附到氧空位的O2能量（E3）之间存在线性关系，表明生成氧空位的容易程度直接影响氧化物的催化效率。

4. 涉及催化循环的三个关键能量——表面氧与CO反应、O2吸附到氧空位以及氧空位形成的能量——通过线性关系相互关联。这意味着这三个能量可以作为描述氧化物表面在氧化反应中催化活性的可靠指标。

[1] "The only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another are the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer and the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy."
[2] "Because they both depend on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, the latter quantity is a good descriptor of catalytic activity."
[3] "All the dopants studied here lower the energy of vacancy formation; therefore, the doped oxides are better oxidants than the undoped ones."
[4] "The energy of oxygen vacancy formation is not a good descriptor of the energies of carbonate decomposition to produce CO2 or of the CO reaction with the O2 adsorbed at a vacancy site."
[5] "The only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another are the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer and the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy."
[6] "The energy of oxygen vacancy formation is a property of the catalyst and is likely to be a good descriptor of the catalytic cycle for oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism."
</quotes>

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the oxide surface reacting with a reactant, such as carbon monoxide (CO), to form a carbonate or a carbon dioxide (CO2) molecule. This CO2 then decomposes to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

2. The energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer and the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy are the only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another. These reactions are influenced by the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, making it a good descriptor of catalytic activity.

3. The dopants used in the study, such as V, Cr, Mo, and W, lower the energy of vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones. This is due to the fact that they facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is a crucial step in the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism.

4. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation is not a suitable descriptor for the energies of carbonate decomposition to produce CO2 or for the CO reaction with the O2 adsorbed at a vacancy site. This is because the energy of these reactions does not change with the catalyst composition or its spin state.

5. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation is a property of the catalyst and is likely to be a good descriptor of the catalytic cycle for oxidation by a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. This is because it correlates with the reactivity of surface oxygen and the ability of the vacancy to adsorb O2, both of which are crucial for the catalytic activity.

1. 马斯万克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的作用涉及氧化物表面与反应物（如二氧化碳）反应形成碳酸盐或二氧化碳分子。然后，生成的二氧化碳分解释放出二氧化碳并修复表面的氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化剂的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

2. 在机制中，只有两种反应的能量随掺杂氧化物的不同而变化：CO与表面层上的氧原子反应的能量和吸附在空位上的O2的能量。这些反应受氧空位形成能的影响，因此它是衡量催化活性的良好指标。

3. 研究中使用的掺杂物，如V、Cr、Mo和W，降低了氧空位形成能，使掺杂氧化物比未掺杂的氧化物具有更强的氧化性。这是由于它们促进了氧空位的形成，这是马斯万克雷伦机制的关键步骤。

4. 氧空位形成能不是用于描述碳酸盐分解产生二氧化碳或CO与空位上吸附的O2反应能量的合适指标。这是因为这些反应的能量不随催化剂组成或其自旋状态的变化而变化。

5. 氧空位形成能是催化剂的一个特性，并且很可能是衡量通过马斯万克雷伦机制进行氧化的催化循环的好指标。这是因为它与表面氧的反应性和空位吸附O2的能力有关，这两种都是催化活性的关键。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the oxide surface binding oxygen atoms to form oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, a lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity, as it signifies an easier formation of oxygen vacancies. This, in turn, enhances the oxide's ability to oxidize reactants efficiently, making it a better oxidant and catalyst. The linearity between ΔEv and key reaction energies supports ΔEv as a reliable descriptor of the catalytic properties in oxide-catalyzed oxidation processes.

1. In the presence of oxygen, dopants like vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W) at the surface bind an oxygen atom, resulting in a chemical compound with the formula MO (where M is V, Cr, Mo, or W).

2. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decreases linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv. Meanwhile, the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv.

3. Catalysts that are efficient in CO catalytic oxidation are anticipated to perform well in other catalytic oxidation reactions that involve a reactant taking one oxygen atom from the surface, due to the correlation between ΔEv and the efficiency of these reactions.
