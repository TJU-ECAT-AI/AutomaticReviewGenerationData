[1] "In the presence of gas phase oxygen all dopants, except Mn, bind an oxygen atom; therefore, the dopant is a MO group (M = V, Cr, Mo, or W)."
[2] "On the basis of previous work we have assumed (and the present calculations confirm) that the dopant does not directly participate in the oxidation reaction; its role is to change the binding energy of the oxygen atoms in the surface layer to the oxide."
[3] "We find that, indeed, it is; the energies E1 and E3 (for steps 1 and 3) are linear functions of the energy of formation of an oxygen vacancy at b2 (see Figure 7)."
[4] "The three energies that change from one catalyst to another (the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation) are related by two linear relations."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of one oxygen atom from the surface to a reactant. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its role as a descriptor of both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a more efficient oxide in generating oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for the mechanism to proceed.

2. The dopants, such as V, Cr, Mo, and W, do not directly participate in the oxidation reaction itself. Instead, they alter the binding energy of the oxygen atoms on the surface layer to the oxide, making the oxide a better oxidant but less active in the oxidation process. This alteration facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the oxide's catalytic properties.

3. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in determining the catalytic activity of the oxide surface. It correlates linearly with the energy of the CO reaction with surface oxygen (E1) and the energy of O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy (E3), indicating that the ease of forming an oxygen vacancy is directly linked to the catalytic efficiency of the oxide.

4. The three critical energies involved in the catalytic cycle—the CO reaction with surface oxygen, the O2 binding to the oxygen vacancy, and the energy of vacancy formation—are interconnected by linear relationships. This implies that these three energies can serve as reliable descriptors of the catalytic activity of the oxide surface in oxidation reactions.

1. 马斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过使表面的氧原子转移到反应物上来实现的。形成氧空位的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物更有效地生成氧空位，这对机制的进行至关重要。

2. V、Cr、Mo、W等掺杂剂不直接参与氧化反应。相反，它们改变表面层中氧原子与氧化物的结合能，使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂但活性降低。这种改变促进了氧空位的形成，增强了氧化物的催化性能。

3. 氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性的关键因素。它与表面氧与CO反应的能量（E1）和吸附到氧空位的O2能量（E3）之间存在线性关系，表明生成氧空位的容易程度直接影响氧化物的催化效率。

4. 涉及催化循环的三个关键能量——表面氧与CO反应、O2吸附到氧空位以及氧空位形成的能量——通过线性关系相互关联。这意味着这三个能量可以作为描述氧化物表面在氧化反应中催化活性的可靠指标。
