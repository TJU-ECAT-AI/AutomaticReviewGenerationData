[1] "We find that in the presence of O, V, Cr, Mo, and W dopants at the surface bind an oxygen atom so that the dopant has formula MO (M = V, Cr, Mo, W)."
[2] "The only two reactions in the mechanism whose energy varies from one doped oxide to another are the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decays linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv, whereas the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv."
[3] "Because ΔEv is a property of the catalyst, we expect that catalysts that are good for CO catalytic oxidation would also be good for other catalytic oxidation reactions in which a reactant takes one oxygen atom from the surface."

1. In the presence of oxygen, dopants like vanadium (V), chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), and tungsten (W) at the surface bind an oxygen atom, resulting in a chemical compound with the formula MO (where M is V, Cr, Mo, or W).

2. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the energy of CO reaction with an oxygen atom from the surface layer decreases linearly with the energy of vacancy formation ΔEv. Meanwhile, the energy of adsorption of O2 at a vacancy is a linear function of ΔEv.

3. Catalysts that are efficient in CO catalytic oxidation are anticipated to perform well in other catalytic oxidation reactions that involve a reactant taking one oxygen atom from the surface, due to the correlation between ΔEv and the efficiency of these reactions.

1. 在氧气存在下，表面的掺杂剂如钒（V）、铬（Cr）、钼（Mo）和钨（W）会与一个氧原子结合，形成化学式为MO的化合物（其中M为V、Cr、Mo或W）。

2. 在氧化物催化氧化反应的马斯-范克里夫伦机制中，表面层CO与氧原子反应的能量随着空位形成能ΔEv的增加呈线性下降。同时，吸附在空位上的O2的能量也与ΔEv成线性关系。

3. 在CO催化氧化效率高的催化剂，预期在涉及从表面取走一个氧原子的其他催化氧化反应中也能表现出良好的性能，因为ΔEv与这些反应的效率之间存在相关性。
