[1] "However, there is a need for more quantitative results concerning the extent of non-stoichiometry on well characterised samples."
[2] "The extent of the B.E.T. surface area has been recognised to be an important parameter in the H, reduction processes,"
[3] "The reduction began at 473 K, irrespec- tive of the initial surface area of the ceria."
[4] "In the case of the low-surface-area sample, an intermediate reduction step was observed between 573 and 623 K, corresponding to the reduction of the surface."

1. More precise quantifiable data regarding the degree of non-stoichiometry on thoroughly characterized samples is needed.
2. The BET surface area has been acknowledged as a significant factor in hydrogen reduction processes.
3. The reduction process started at 473 K regardless of the initial surface area of the ceria.
4. An intermediary reduction phase was noted between 573 and 623 K on the low-surface-area sample, indicating surface reduction.
