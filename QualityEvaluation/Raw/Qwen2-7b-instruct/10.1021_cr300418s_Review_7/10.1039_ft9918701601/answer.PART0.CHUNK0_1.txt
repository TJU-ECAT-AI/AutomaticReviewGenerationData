[1] "The reduction of CeO, by hydrogen has been studied from 300-1200 K by several complementary techniques:temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and magnetic susceptibility measurements, Fourier-transform infra- red (FTIR), UV-VIS diffuse reflectance and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy."
[2] "The state of the initial B.E.T. surface did not influence the oxidation process. A slight excess adsorption of oxygen was evident on the surface. This was thermodesorbed at 380 K under vacuum."
[3] "The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band in the UV-VIS reflectance spectrum also varied with the degree of reduction."
[4] "The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band appeared to vary with the reduction state of the ceria since the results are completely in agreement with those reported below, obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements."
[5] "However, the band was hardly noticeable on Ce0,-850 at such reduction temperatures, heating at 973 K under H, being necessary to make it strong in this case."
[6] "The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band appeared to vary with the reduction state of the ceria since the results are completely in agreement with those reported below, obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements."

1. The reduction of CeO, by hydrogen was studied using various techniques including temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), magnetic susceptibility measurements, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), UV-VIS diffuse reflectance, and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy. 
2. The initial BET surface area of the ceria did not affect the oxidation process. There was a slight excess adsorption of oxygen on the surface, which was thermodesorbed at 380 K under vacuum.
3. The intensity of the 17000 cm-1 band in the UV-VIS reflectance spectrum changed with the degree of reduction.
4. The variation in the intensity of the 17000 cm-1 band was consistent with the reduction state of the ceria, as indicated by magnetic susceptibility measurements.
5. Heating CeO,-850 at 973 K under hydrogen was necessary to observe the strong 17000 cm-1 band.
6. The variation in the intensity of the 17000 cm-1 band correlated with the reduction state of the ceria, as confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements.

1. 对铈氧化物（CeO,）通过氢气的还原研究，使用了包括温度程序化减少（TPR）、磁感应性测量、傅里叶变换红外光谱（FTIR）、紫外可见漫反射和X射线光电电子谱（XPS）在内的多种互补技术。
2. 初始BET表面积对氧化过程没有影响。表面存在轻微的过量吸附氧，该氧在380 K下真空条件下被脱附。
3. UV-VIS漫反射谱中17000 cm-1波数的强度随还原程度的变化而变化。
4. 17000 cm-1波数的强度变化与铈氧化物的还原状态一致，这与磁感应性测量结果相符。
5. 在973 K下用氢气加热CeO,-850才能观察到强烈的17000 cm-1波数。
6. 17000 cm-1波数的强度变化与铈氧化物的还原状态一致，这得到了磁感应性测量结果的支持。
