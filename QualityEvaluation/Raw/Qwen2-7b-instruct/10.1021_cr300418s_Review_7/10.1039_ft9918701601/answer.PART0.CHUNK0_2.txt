The apparatus is described in ref. 10. The H, consumption was measured by means of a catharometric detector. The reactants (1% H, in Ar) were passed over the catalyst (200 mg) with a 1.1 dm3 h-' flow rate. The water produced by the reduction was trapped on a molecular sieve. The heating rate was 8 K min-'.FTIR and UV Spectroscopy IR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 60 SX spectrometer using the absorbance mode. The UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Beckmann 5240 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically signifies greater catalytic activity and oxidizing capability due to the enhanced availability of oxygen vacancies for reaction sites.
