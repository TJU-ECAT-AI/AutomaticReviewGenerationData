[1] "TPR
The apparatus is described in ref. 10. The H, consumption was measured by means of a catharometric detector. The reactants (1% H, in Ar) were passed over the catalyst (200 mg) with a 1.1 dm3 h-' flow rate."
[2] "For example, in the TPR experiments, some artifacts can interfere in the interpretation of the measurements, e.g. the effect of the hydrogenation of carbonates on the H, consumption."
[3] "The state of the initial B.E.T. surface did not influence the oxidation process. A slight excess adsorption of oxygen was evident on the surface."
[4] "The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band in the UV-VIS reflectance spectrum also varied with the degree of reduction."
[5] "Gravimetric measurements alone cannot give a correct estimate of the degree of reduction and therefore, the Ce3+ ion content."

1. The hydrogen consumption in the TPR experiments was measured using a catharometric detector. Reactants, which included 1% hydrogen in argon, were flowed over the catalyst at a rate of 1.1 dm3 per hour.
2. In TPR experiments, artifacts might affect the interpretation of measurements, such as the hydrogenation of carbonates influencing hydrogen consumption.
3. The initial B.E.T. surface area of the material did not impact the oxidation process. A small excess of oxygen was observable on the surface.
4. The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band in the UV-VIS reflectance spectrum changed depending on the degree of reduction.
5. Gravimetric methods alone were insufficient for accurately estimating the degree of reduction and the content of Ce3+ ions.

1. 在TPR实验中，通过电导检测器测量氢消耗。反应物包括1%氢和氩，以每小时1.1dm3的速率流过催化剂。
2. 在TPR实验中，可能有干扰测量结果的副作用，例如碳酸盐的氢化作用影响氢消耗。
3. 初始B.E.T.比表面积对氧化过程没有影响。表面上存在轻微的氧过剩。
4. UV-VIS反射光谱中17000 cm-'波段的强度随着还原程度的变化而变化。
5. 单独使用称重法无法准确估计还原程度和Ce3+离子含量。
