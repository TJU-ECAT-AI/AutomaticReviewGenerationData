[1] "The reduction of CeO, by hydrogen has been studied from 300-1200 K by several complementary techniques:temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and magnetic susceptibility measurements, Fourier-transform infra- red (FTIR), UV-VIS diffuse reflectance and X-ray photoelectron (XP) spectroscopy."
[2] "The state of the initial B.E.T. surface did not influence the oxidation process. A slight excess adsorption of oxygen was evident on the surface. This was thermodesorbed at 380 K under vacuum."
[3] "The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band in the UV-VIS reflectance spectrum also varied with the degree of reduction."
[4] "The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band appeared to vary with the reduction state of the ceria since the results are completely in agreement with those reported below, obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements."
[5] "However, the band was hardly noticeable on Ce0,-850 at such reduction temperatures, heating at 973 K under H, being necessary to make it strong in this case."
[6] "The intensity of the 17000 cm-' band appeared to vary with the reduction state of the ceria since the results are completely in agreement with those reported below, obtained from magnetic susceptibility measurements."

The apparatus is described in ref. 10. The H, consumption was measured by means of a catharometric detector. The reactants (1% H, in Ar) were passed over the catalyst (200 mg) with a 1.1 dm3 h-' flow rate. The water produced by the reduction was trapped on a molecular sieve. The heating rate was 8 K min-'.FTIR and UV Spectroscopy IR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet 60 SX spectrometer using the absorbance mode. The UV-VIS diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded on a Beckmann 5240 spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically signifies greater catalytic activity and oxidizing capability due to the enhanced availability of oxygen vacancies for reaction sites.
