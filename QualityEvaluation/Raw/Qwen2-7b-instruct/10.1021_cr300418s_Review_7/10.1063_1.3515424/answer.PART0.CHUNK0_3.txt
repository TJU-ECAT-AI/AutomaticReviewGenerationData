[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen vacancies are formed on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
[2] "In the context of Cu/CeO₂ surfaces, the thermodynamic, electronic, and structural properties are investigated through first-principles DFT+U calculations. These calculations provide insights into the behavior of Cu adatoms on CeO₂ surfaces, the Cu/CeO₂ interface, and the adsorption processes."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for this process, denoted as ΔEv, significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. In the study of Cu/CeO₂ surfaces, first-principles DFT+U calculations are utilized to analyze the thermodynamic, electronic, and structural properties, offering detailed information on the behavior of Cu adatoms on CeO₂ surfaces, the Cu/CeO₂ interface, and adsorption processes.
