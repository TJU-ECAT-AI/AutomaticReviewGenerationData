          [1] "In this work, we perform first-principles density functional theory plus U (DFT+U) calculations to investigate the thermodynamic, electronic, and structural properties of Cu/CeO₂(111) surfaces and interfaces."
          [2] "The Cu adatom on the stoichiometric CeO₂(111) surface is energetically favorable."
          [3] "The Cu/CeO₂(111) interface exhibits a strong interaction between Cu and CeO₂."
          [4] "The ΔEv for oxygen vacancy formation is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which facilitates the adsorption of reactants and enhances the reaction rate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more energetically favorable process, leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability.

          火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面形成氧空位来运行，这有助于吸附反应物并增强反应速率。氧空位形成的能量需求（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv值表示更有利于的过程，导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。
