The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms between adsorbed species on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically indicate stronger binding of oxygen vacancies, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more efficient oxygen atom transfer processes.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面吸附物种之间的氧原子转移来发挥作用。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。较高的ΔEv值通常表示氧空位的更强结合，这可以导致增强的催化活性和氧化能力，因为可以更有效地进行氧原子传输过程。
