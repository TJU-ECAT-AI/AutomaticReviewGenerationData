The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of an intermediate species, typically involving the adsorption of oxygen atoms onto the surface of an oxide catalyst. This adsorbed oxygen can then participate in a series of chemical reactions leading to the oxidation of the substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest easier oxygen vacancy creation, which could enhance the surface's reactivity and thus its catalytic performance. However, excessive vacancy formation might also lead to surface instability, affecting the overall efficiency of the catalytic process.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过吸附氧原子到氧化物催化剂表面的中间物种运行。吸附的氧随后可以参与一系列化学反应，导致底物的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有决定性的影响。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位的形成更容易，这可以增强表面的活性，从而提高其催化性能。然而，过多的空位形成也可能导致表面不稳定，影响催化过程的整体效率。
