The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between oxygen atoms. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences the surface properties of the oxide, affecting its catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Higher ΔEv typically leads to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to enhanced electron mobility and reactivity.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧原子之间的电子转移起作用。氧空位形成（ΔEv）具有重要意义，因为它影响氧化物表面的性质，进而影响其催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv通常会导致增强的催化活性和氧化能力，这是由于电子移动性和反应性的增加所致。
