The classical model proposing that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen atom in the Al-doped SiO2 defect center was challenged by recent theoretical studies. These studies utilized advanced first-principle approaches, including density-functional theory (DFT), to demonstrate that the hole is completely delocalized over the four oxygen neighbors surrounding the aluminum impurity. The validity of these findings was supported by comparisons with experimental data, such as hyperfine coupling parameters.

最近的理论研究挑战了这一经典模型，该模型认为在Al掺杂的SiO2缺陷中心形成一个空穴在邻近氧原子的一个非键合轨道中。这些研究采用了高级的第一原理方法，包括密度泛函理论（DFT），证明了空穴完全分布在围绕铝杂质的四个氧原子周围。这些发现的有效性通过与实验数据的比较得到了支持，例如超精细耦合参数。
