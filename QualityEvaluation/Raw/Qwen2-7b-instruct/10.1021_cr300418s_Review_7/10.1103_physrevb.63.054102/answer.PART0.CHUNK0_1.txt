The validity of this conclusion is based on the direct comparison of computed and measured quantities such as the 17O hyperfine and 27Al, 29Si superhyperfine coupling parameters, the 27Al nuclear quadrupole effect, and the derivable local distortion around the defect.
Using cluster models containing as many as 104 Si and O atoms and various theoretical approaches, we show that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when an exact treatment of the exchange term is used.

The research demonstrates that the delocalized model of the hole in the AlO4 center is an artifact resulting from the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach. An exact treatment of the electron exchange term leads to the conclusion that the hole is fully localized. The validity of this finding is supported by comparisons between computed and measured quantities including hyperfine and superhyperfine coupling parameters, the nuclear quadrupole effect, and local distortions around the defect.
