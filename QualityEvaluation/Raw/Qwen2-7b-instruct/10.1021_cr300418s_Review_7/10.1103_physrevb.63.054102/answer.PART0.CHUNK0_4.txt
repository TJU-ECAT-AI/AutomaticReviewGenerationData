[1] "Three recent theoretical studies based on first-principle density-functional theory DFT! and band-structure plane-wave calculations proposed an alternative model where the hole is completely delocalized over four oxygen neighbors to the Al impurity, at 0 K."
[2] "Using cluster models containing as many as 104 Si and O atoms and various theoretical approaches, we show that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when an exact treatment of the exchange term is used."
[3] "The validity of this conclusion is based on the direct comparison of computed and measured quantities such as the 17O hyperfine and 27Al, 29Si superhyperfine coupling parameters, the 27Al nuclear quadrupole effect, and the derivable local distortion around the defect."

The classical model of the AlO40 defect center in irradiated quartz proposes that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen atom, leading to asymmetric relaxation along the Al-O direction. However, recent studies using first-principle density-functional theory (DFT) and band-structure plane-wave calculations suggested an alternative model where the hole is completely delocalized over four oxygen neighbors to the Al impurity. Our research, employing cluster models and various theoretical methods, demonstrates that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach. An exact treatment of the exchange term yields a fully localized hole. This conclusion is substantiated by comparing computed and measured quantities such as hyperfine and superhyperfine coupling parameters, the 27Al nuclear quadrupole effect, and local distortions around the defect.

经典模型认为，在石英中替代四配位硅原子的Al杂质处，形成一个非共价键氧原子上的空穴，并沿Al-O方向产生不对称弛豫。然而，最近的研究利用第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）和带结构平面波计算提出了一种替代模型，即空穴完全分布在Al杂质周围的四个氧邻域内。我们的研究使用簇模型和各种理论方法表明，分布式图像是DFT方法的产物。通过精确处理交换项，得到的是完全局部化的空穴。这一结论通过比较计算和测量的量，如17O核偶合参数、27Al和29Si的超核偶合参数、27Al核四极效应以及缺陷周围的局部变形得以证实。
