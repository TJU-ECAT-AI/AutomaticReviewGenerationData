[1] "This classical model has recently been challenged by three theoretical papers based on advanced first-principle approaches.15,16,17 These studies were based on supercell calculations with proper inclusion of boundary conditions and density-functional theory DFT!. They all concluded that the hole in the @AlO4#0 defect is completely delocalized over the four O neighbors1517 in contrast to the phenomenological model results reported previously.16"
[2] "Using cluster models containing as many as 104 Si and O atoms and various theoretical approaches, we show that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when an exact treatment of the exchange term is used."

The classical model for the AlO4#0 defect center in quartz suggests that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen atom, leading to asymmetric relaxation along the Al-O direction. However, recent theoretical studies employing advanced first-principle approaches and density-functional theory DFT have challenged this model. These studies indicate that the hole is actually completely delocalized over the four oxygen neighbors to the Al impurity, rather than being localized. The researchers found that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when an exact treatment of the exchange term is used.

对于氧化铝4#0缺陷中心在石英中的经典模型认为，一个空穴形成在一个相邻氧原子的非键合轨道中，导致沿Al-O方向的不对称松弛。然而，最近的一些理论研究使用高级的第一原理方法和密度泛函理论DFT对这一模型提出了挑战。这些研究表明，空穴实际上是完全分布在四个相邻的氧原子周围，而不是仅局限于Al杂质附近。研究者发现，DFT方法产生的分布式结果是一个方法论的偏见，只有精确处理交换项时才能得到完全局部化的空穴。

The validity of this conclusion is based on the direct comparison of computed and measured quantities such as the 17O hyperfine and 27Al, 29Si superhyperfine coupling parameters, the 27Al nuclear quadrupole effect, and the derivable local distortion around the defect.

The research demonstrates that the delocalized model of the hole in the AlO4 center is an artifact resulting from the Density Functional Theory (DFT) approach. An exact treatment of the electron exchange term leads to the conclusion that the hole is fully localized. The validity of this finding is supported by comparisons between computed and measured quantities including hyperfine and superhyperfine coupling parameters, the nuclear quadrupole effect, and local distortions around the defect.

The classical model proposing that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen atom in the Al-doped SiO2 defect center was challenged by recent theoretical studies. These studies utilized advanced first-principle approaches, including density-functional theory (DFT), to demonstrate that the hole is completely delocalized over the four oxygen neighbors surrounding the aluminum impurity. The validity of these findings was supported by comparisons with experimental data, such as hyperfine coupling parameters.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules, enabling the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically signifies a greater barrier for oxygen vacancy creation, potentially affecting the reaction rate and efficiency of the oxidation process. The exact relationship between ΔEv and the catalytic performance depends on the specific oxide material and its surface chemistry.

The classical model of the AlO40 defect center in irradiated quartz proposes that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen atom, leading to asymmetric relaxation along the Al-O direction. However, recent studies using first-principle density-functional theory (DFT) and band-structure plane-wave calculations suggested an alternative model where the hole is completely delocalized over four oxygen neighbors to the Al impurity. Our research, employing cluster models and various theoretical methods, demonstrates that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach. An exact treatment of the exchange term yields a fully localized hole. This conclusion is substantiated by comparing computed and measured quantities such as hyperfine and superhyperfine coupling parameters, the 27Al nuclear quadrupole effect, and local distortions around the defect.

经典模型认为，在石英中替代四配位硅原子的Al杂质处，形成一个非共价键氧原子上的空穴，并沿Al-O方向产生不对称弛豫。然而，最近的研究利用第一原理密度泛函理论（DFT）和带结构平面波计算提出了一种替代模型，即空穴完全分布在Al杂质周围的四个氧邻域内。我们的研究使用簇模型和各种理论方法表明，分布式图像是DFT方法的产物。通过精确处理交换项，得到的是完全局部化的空穴。这一结论通过比较计算和测量的量，如17O核偶合参数、27Al和29Si的超核偶合参数、27Al核四极效应以及缺陷周围的局部变形得以证实。
