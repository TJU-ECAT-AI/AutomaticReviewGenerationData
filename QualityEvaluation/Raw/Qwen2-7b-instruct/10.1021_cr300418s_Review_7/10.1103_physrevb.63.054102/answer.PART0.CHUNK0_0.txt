The classical model for the AlO4#0 defect center in quartz suggests that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen atom, leading to asymmetric relaxation along the Al-O direction. However, recent theoretical studies employing advanced first-principle approaches and density-functional theory DFT have challenged this model. These studies indicate that the hole is actually completely delocalized over the four oxygen neighbors to the Al impurity, rather than being localized. The researchers found that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when an exact treatment of the exchange term is used.

对于氧化铝4#0缺陷中心在石英中的经典模型认为，一个空穴形成在一个相邻氧原子的非键合轨道中，导致沿Al-O方向的不对称松弛。然而，最近的一些理论研究使用高级的第一原理方法和密度泛函理论DFT对这一模型提出了挑战。这些研究表明，空穴实际上是完全分布在四个相邻的氧原子周围，而不是仅局限于Al杂质附近。研究者发现，DFT方法产生的分布式结果是一个方法论的偏见，只有精确处理交换项时才能得到完全局部化的空穴。
