[1] "This work shows that great care is needed when DFT is used to describe localized holes in insulators."
[2] "Using cluster models containing as many as 104 Si and O atoms and various theoretical approaches, we show that the delocalized picture is an artifact of the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when an exact treatment of the exchange term is used."
[3] "The validity of our theoretical results has been checked by comparing the hyperfine coupling parameters computed at various levels of theory with the corresponding experimental quantities."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules, enabling the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically signifies a greater barrier for oxygen vacancy creation, potentially affecting the reaction rate and efficiency of the oxidation process. The exact relationship between ΔEv and the catalytic performance depends on the specific oxide material and its surface chemistry.

火星-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧原子转移到反应分子，从而促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性影响。较高的ΔEv通常意味着氧空位生成的更高障碍，这可能会影响反应速率和氧化过程的效率。ΔEv与催化性能之间的确切关系取决于特定的氧化物材料及其表面化学性质。
