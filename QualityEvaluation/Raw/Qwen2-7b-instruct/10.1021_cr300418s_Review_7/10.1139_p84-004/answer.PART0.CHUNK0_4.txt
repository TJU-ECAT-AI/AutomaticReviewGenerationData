[1] "Thus it is evident that small clusters of atoms can be used successfully to simulate the local surroundings of a substitutional Al ion in quartz, i.e., the short-range effects are the most important."
[2] "For any given quasi tetrahedron in the crystal, we will use the symbols 0 (> )  and 0 (< ) to label the oxygen ions of the two types, irrespective of changes in bond lengths (possibly even in their relative lengths) caused by the presence of an aluminum ion and possibly one or more holes in the electron orbitals on the oxygen(s)."
[3] "It is known (4-7) that the centre [A10,I0 contains a hole trapped in the nonbonding p orbital of an oxygen adjacent to the aluminum. Thus its electron spin S = 112."
[4] "The observed probability (20) for two electrons to be knocked out of the aluminum region, resulting in the centre [AlO,]+. This species decays if the crystal is warmed to room temperature."
[5] "The calculated atomic spin densities on the oxygens varied only slightly between models I and 2 for the two-hole centre in its ground state (see Table 3)."

1. Small clusters of atoms can effectively simulate the local environment of a substituted aluminum ion in quartz, highlighting the importance of short-range effects.
2. In a given quasi-tetrahedron, the oxygen ions are labeled with 0 (> ) and 0 (< ) regardless of bond length changes influenced by aluminum ions and electron orbital holes.
3. The [A10,I0 center features a trapped hole within the nonbonding p orbital of an adjacent aluminum, with an electron spin of S = 112.
4. The probability of knocking out two electrons from the aluminum region, creating the [AlO,]+ center, is observed. This species decays when the crystal is heated to room temperature.
5. The atomic spin densities on the oxygen atoms in the two-hole center's ground state models (1 and 2) did not significantly vary.

1. 小原子簇可以成功地模拟石英中的替代铝离子的局部环境，短程效应尤为重要。
2. 在给定的准四面体中，无论铝离子和氧电子轨道上的一个或多个空穴导致的键长变化如何，我们使用符号0 (> ) 和0 (< ) 来标记两种氧离子类型。
3. [A10,I0中心包含一个被相邻铝原子附近的非共价p轨道捕获的空穴，其电子自旋为S = 112。
4. 观察到从铝区域敲出两个电子的概率（20），形成[AlO,]+中心。当晶体加热至室温时，这种物种会衰变。
5. 在两孔中心的地面状态模型（1和2）中，氧原子的原子自旋密度没有显著变化。
