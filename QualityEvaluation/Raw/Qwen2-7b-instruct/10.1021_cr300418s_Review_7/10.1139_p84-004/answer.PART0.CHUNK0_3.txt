[1] "The concept of energy bands is not applicable to small clusters of atoms, we will use "bands" here to denote the groups of orbital energy levels that in an infinitely large cluster would form energy bands."
[2] "The orbital energy levels for the "valence" and "conduction" bands calculated for the small model of [SiO4I0] are depicted in Fig. 6. The lowest of the valence bands consists mainly of oxygen 2s orbitals with small contributions from silicon 3s and 3p admixed in the lower and upper levels of these respectively. The upper valence bands in the quartz model contain mostly oxygen 2p orbitals with some admixture of silicon 3s and 3p orbitals in the lower and upper levels of these bands, respectively."
[3] "The total energies of model 1 for the various centres range of the optimized geometry are included in Table 2. We see that the ground state two-hole model [AlO,]' has the highest total energy, ca. 0.144 a.u. (3.92 eV) higher than the ground state one-hole model [A1O,]O. The [A1O4]- model has a total energy ca. 0.072 a.u. (1.96 eV) higher than that of the [A1O,]O model."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of oxygen vacancies is easier, which can enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Therefore, the ΔEv is a key factor in understanding and optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.
2. The orbital energy levels for the "valence" and "conduction" bands in the small model of [SiO4I0] are depicted in Fig. 6. The lowest valence band consists mainly of oxygen 2s orbitals, with small contributions from silicon 3s and 3p orbitals. The upper valence bands in the quartz model contain mostly oxygen 2p orbitals, with some admixture of silicon 3s and 3p orbitals. The upper valence band edge is primarily composed of oxygen 2p orbitals. These energy levels provide insights into the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of the [SiO4I0] cluster.
3. The total energies of the various models at their optimized geometries are listed in Table 2. Among these models, the ground state two-hole model [AlO,]' exhibits the highest total energy, approximately 0.144 a.u. (3.92 eV) higher than the ground state one-hole model [A1O,]O. The [A1O4]- model has a total energy approximately 0.072 a.u. (1.96 eV) higher than the [A1O,]O model. These differences in total energy reflect the stability and energetics of the different centers in quartz, with the [A1O4]- model being less stable than the [A1O,]' model.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧化物表面的氧空位（Ov）的形成而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位的形成更容易，这可以增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。因此，ΔEv是理解并优化氧化反应中氧化物催化剂性能的关键因素。
2. 在[SiO4I0]的小模型中，“价”和“传导”带的能级如图6所示。最低的价带主要由氧2s轨道组成，硅3s和3p轨道分别在较低和较高水平上贡献较小。石英模型中的上价带包含主要由氧2p轨道组成的上价带，硅3s和3p轨道分别在较低和较高水平上混合。上价带边缘主要由氧2p轨道组成。这些能级提供了关于[SiO4I0]簇的电子结构和键合特性的见解。
3. 表2列出了各种模型在其优化几何形状下的总能量。在这几个模型中，双孔基态模型[A1O,]'具有最高的总能量，大约比单孔基态模型[A1O,]O高0.144 a.u.（3.92 eV）。[A1O4]-模型的总能量大约比[A1O,]O模型高0.072 a.u.（1.96 eV）。这些总能量差异反映了不同中心在石英中的稳定性和能量特性，其中[A1O4]-模型比[A1O,]'模型更不稳定。
