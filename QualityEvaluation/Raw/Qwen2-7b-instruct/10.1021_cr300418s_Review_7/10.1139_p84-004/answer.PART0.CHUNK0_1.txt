[1] "The total energies of model 1 for the various centres range of the observed luminescence bands. As already stated, the centre [AIO1]- has not been observed as such, but rather with a charge-compensating ion M+ in the neighbourhood; see, for example, the dielectric measurements discussed by Nowick and Stanley (36).Thus recombination of centre [A1O4I0 and an electron would likely also require the simultaneous migration of an M + ion to act as charge compensator."
[2] "In a single restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF SCF-MO) calculation, the spin multiplicity 2 s  + 1 was con- strained to I. The atomic positions obtained for the geometry-optimized nine-atom model of [AlO,]- were used, with the total charge set to + 1, corresponding to the two-hole centre."

1. The centre [A1O1]- has not been observed as an isolated entity but is typically found with a charge-compensating ion M+ in its surroundings. The recombination of [A1O4I0] with an electron might necessitate the movement of an M+ ion to maintain charge neutrality.

2. In the two-hole centre [AlO1]', the spin multiplicity was constrained to 1, implying a triplet state. The atomic positions from the optimized nine-atom model of [AlO,]- were utilized with a total charge of +1 to represent this two-hole configuration.

1. 中心[A1O1]-并未被观察到作为一个单独的实体，而是通常与补偿电荷的离子M+一起存在。[A1O4I0]与电子的复合可能需要一个M+离子的移动来保持电中性。

2. 在双空穴中心[AlO1]'中，自旋多重度被限制为1，意味着三重态状态。从优化后的九原子模型[AlO,]-中获取的原子位置被使用，并设置总电荷为+1，以代表这个双空穴配置。
