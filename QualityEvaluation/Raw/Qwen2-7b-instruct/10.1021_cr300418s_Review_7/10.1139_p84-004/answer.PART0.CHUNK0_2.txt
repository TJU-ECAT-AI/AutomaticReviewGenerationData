2. Calculations using the SCF-MO method "ab initio" on clusters of 9 and 15 atoms aim to simulate quartz, specifically the [SiO4] unit and aluminum impurity centers [A104]-, [AIO], [A104]', in quartz, terminated by protons or SiH groups.

[1] "The total energies of model 1 for the various centres range of the observed luminescence bands. As already stated, the centre [AIO1]- has not been observed as such, but rather with a charge-compensating ion Mt in the neighbourhood; see, for example, the dielectric measurements discussed by Nowick and Stanley (36).Thus recombination of centre [A1O4I0 and an electron would likely also require the simultaneous migration of an Mt + ion to act as charge compensator."
</quotes>

3. The total energy differences between the various models correlate with the observed luminescence bands. As previously mentioned, the [AIO1]- center is typically not observed alone, but rather accompanied by a charge-compensating ion Mt nearby. Therefore, the recombination of the [A1O4I0 center with an electron would likely necessitate the concurrent movement of an Mt + ion to maintain charge balance.

3. 各种模型的总能量范围与观察到的荧光带相吻合。正如之前所述，[AIO1]- 中心通常不会单独观察到，而是与附近的一个补偿离子Mt一起出现；例如，诺威克和斯坦利讨论的介电测量（36）。因此，[A1O4I0]中心与电子的重新组合很可能会需要同时移动一个Mt + 离子以维持电荷平衡。

[1] "The orbital energy levels for the 'valence' and 'conduction' bands calculated for the small model of [SiO4I0 are depicted in Fig. 6. The lowest of the valence bands consists mainly of oxygen 2s orbitals with small contributions from silicon 3s and 3p admixed in the lower and upper levels of these respectively. The upper valence bands in the quartz model contain mostly oxygen 2p orbitals with some admixture of silicon 3s and 3p orbitals in the lower and upper levels of these, respectively. The upper valence band edge is composed mainly of oxygen 2p"

4. The calculated orbital energy levels for the "valence" and "conduction" bands in the small model of [SiO4I0 are illustrated in Figure 6. The lowest valence band is predominantly made up of oxygen 2s orbitals, with slight contributions from silicon 3s and 3p orbitals in the lower and upper levels respectively. The upper valence bands within the quartz model are largely comprised of oxygen 2p orbitals, with some incorporation of silicon 3s and 3p orbitals in the lower and upper levels accordingly. The top boundary of the upper valence band is primarily constituted by oxygen 2p orbitals.

4. 在小模型的[SiO4I0]中，“价”和“传导”能级的计算轨道能级在图6中表示。最低价带主要由氧2s轨道组成，分别在较低和较高水平上轻微贡献硅3s和3p轨道。石英模型中的上价带主要是氧2p轨道，其中较低和较高水平上分别混合了一些硅3s和3p轨道。上价带的顶部主要由氧2p轨道构成。
