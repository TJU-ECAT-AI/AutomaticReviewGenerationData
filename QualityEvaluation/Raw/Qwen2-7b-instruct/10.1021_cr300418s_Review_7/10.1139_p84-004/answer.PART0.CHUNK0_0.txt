[1] "Thus it is evident that small clusters of atoms can be used successfully to simulate the local surroundings of a substitutional Al ion in quartz, i.e., the short-range effects are the most important."
[2] "Every oxygen anion thus has one bond of each type."
[3] "For any given quasi tetrahedron in the crystal, we will use the symbols 0 ( > )  and 0 ( < ) to label the oxygen ions of the two types, irrespective of changes in bond lengths (possibly even in their relative lengths) caused by the presence of an aluminum ion and possibly one or more holes in the electron orbitals on the oxygen(s)."
[4] "The hole in ground state [A10,I0 is now known, from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) results, to be trapped on one of the two equivalent oxygens O(>) (8)."
[5] "The calculations will be used to arrive at probable geometries for the various centres."

1. Small clusters of atoms can effectively simulate the local environment of a substituted aluminum ion in quartz, highlighting the importance of short-range interactions.
2. Each oxygen anion in quartz has a pair of long and short Si-O bonds.
3. The oxygen ions in a quasi-tetrahedron are labeled with 0 ( > ) and 0 ( < ) regardless of bond length changes influenced by aluminum ions or electron orbital holes.
4. The trapped hole in the ground state [A10,I0 is identified as being localized on one of the two equivalent oxygens O(>) through EPR experiments.
5. Calculations aim to determine likely geometries for various impurity centers in quartz.
