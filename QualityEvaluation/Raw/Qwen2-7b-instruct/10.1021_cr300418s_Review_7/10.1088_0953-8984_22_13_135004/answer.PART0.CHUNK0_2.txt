[1] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."
[2] "The origin for this lies in the crystal faces that are exposed on these structures. Nanoparticles expose primarily (111) faces,while nanorods expose primarily (110) faces."
[3] "Recent experimental work has shown that many metal dopants enhance the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria."
[4] "In this approach, the value of U must be somehow chosen; our earlier work arrived at U = 5 eV, based on comparison of the photoemission spectrum of reduced ceria and the computed density of states."
[5] "With no U on oxygen, the O2 binding energy is overestimated by 1.4 eV. With U = 7 eV on O 2p, the computed binding energy of 4.91 eV is rather close to the experimental data."
[6] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."
[7] "In the present example, substitution of Ce4+ with La3+ results in formation of an La/ Ce + O· O defect centre, with an oxygen hole."
[8] "With no U on oxygen, there are two sets of LaO distances,three at 2.36 A and another three at 2.37 A; the former La O distances involve terminating surface oxygen atoms and the latter distances involve subsurface oxygen atoms and both are rather similar to the CeO distances in the surface."
[9] "With U O 2p, there is a notable distortion present. The LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms elongate to 2.52 A, while to subsurface oxygen atoms, the LaO distances are 2.46 A."
[10] "With U on oxygen, there is a strong distortion present. The LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms elongate to 2.61 A, while to subsurface oxygen atoms, the LaO distances are 2.50 A."
[11] "In the (111) surface, this gives LaO distances of 2.52 A to terminal oxygen atoms and 2.46 A to subsurface oxygen atoms."
[12] "On the (110) surface, this results in two surface LaO distances of 2.60 A and 2.50 A to one pair of surface oxygen atoms (very similar to one La dopant in the surface) and two surface LaO distances of 2.41 A."
[13] "The finding that oxygen vacancy formation on ceria surfaces doped with La results in formation of Ce3+ and an oxygen hole seems at first surprising, since it is generally accepted that the formation of an oxygen vacancy defect compensates an aliovalent dopant with a lower oxidation state."
[14] "Cerium however is more easily reduced compared to the oxides listed above, and formation of an oxygen vacancy (with an appropriate value of U on Ce, as in the present paper) results in formation of reduced Ce3+."
[15] "Perhaps the most interesting finding is that oxygen vacancy formation does not compensate the electronic holes, but instead compensates one hole and produces one Ce3+ ion, so that both electronic holes and Ce3+ ions can be present in La-doped ceria."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the sequential oxidation of organic molecules on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen vacancy formation, which can facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. The oxidizing ability is also influenced by ΔEv, as a lower value allows for easier oxygen incorporation, promoting oxidation reactions.

2. The ceria surface exposed primarily (111) faces due to the nature of the nanoparticles, while nanorods exposed primarily (110) faces. Many metal dopants were found to increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria, enhancing its catalytic properties.

3. The choice of U in the DFT + U approach is essential for accurately describing the electronic structure of the doped systems. Our earlier work determined U = 5 eV based on comparisons of the photoemission spectrum of reduced ceria and the computed density of states.

4. The binding energy of O2 is significantly overestimated by DFT without applying U on O 2p states. Using U = 7 eV on O 2p leads to a computed binding energy that closely matches experimental data, indicating the suitability of this approach for thermodynamic calculations.

5. The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in La-doped ceria surfaces is notably reduced compared to the undoped surfaces. This reduction suggests that the formation of oxygen vacancies is favored in doped ceria, potentially enhancing its reactivity and catalytic activity.

6. Substitution of Ce4+ with La3+ in ceria leads to the formation of an La/Ce + O·O defect center, characterized by an oxygen hole. This behavior is distinct from typical metal oxides, where oxygen vacancies usually compensate dopants with lower oxidation states.

7. In the undoped ceria (111) surface, LaO distances are found to be similar to CeO distances, indicating minimal distortion. In contrast, with U applied on oxygen, LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms elongate significantly.

8. The presence of U on O 2p states in the calculations leads to notable distortions in the La-doped ceria surfaces. Terminal oxygen atoms exhibit elongated LaO distances, while subsurface oxygen atoms show slightly reduced distances.

9. The geometry of La-doped ceria surfaces reveals that the La ion moves away from pairs of surface oxygen atoms, shortening the distance to the other pairs. This movement results in elongated LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms.

10. In La-doped ceria, oxygen vacancy formation does not compensate the electronic holes. Instead, it leads to the formation of one Ce3+ ion alongside an oxygen hole, allowing both defects to coexist in the material.

1. 罗斯-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面顺序氧化有机分子进行操作。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对催化剂表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv意味着较高的氧空位形成倾向，有助于反应物的吸附和活化，从而增强催化活性。氧的氧化能力也受到ΔEv的影响，较低值允许更轻松地整合氧气，促进氧化反应。

2. 由于纳米颗粒的性质，铈表面主要暴露（111）面，而纳米棒主要暴露（110）面。许多金属掺杂剂被发现增加了铈的氧空位形成能和活性，增强了其催化性能。

3. 在DFT + U方法中选择U至关重要，以准确描述掺杂系统的电子结构。我们之前的工作根据还原铈的光发射光谱和计算的密度状态比较确定U = 5 eV。

4. O2的结合能由DFT显著高估，没有在O 2p状态下应用U。使用U = 7 eV在O 2p上，计算的结合能与实验数据相当，表明这种方法适用于热力学计算。

5. 在La掺杂铈的表面中，氧空位的形成能相比未掺杂表面显著降低。这种减少表明在掺杂铈中形成氧空位的趋势增加，可能增强其活性和催化性能。

6. 将Ce4+替换为La3+在铈中导致形成La/Ce + O·O缺陷中心，特征为氧空位。这种行为与典型的金属氧化物不同，在这些氧化物中，氧空位通常补偿具有较低氧化状态的掺杂剂。

7. 在未掺杂的铈（111）表面上，LaO距离类似于CeO距离，表明几乎没有失真。相比之下，在应用U到氧上的计算中，终端氧原子附近的LaO距离显著延长。

8. 在La掺杂铈中，应用U到O 2p状态导致铈表面的明显畸变。终端氧原子的LaO距离显著延长，而亚表面氧原子的LaO距离略有减小。

9. 在La掺杂铈表面上，La离子从一组表面氧原子移动，缩短到另一组的距离。这导致终端氧原子附近的LaO距离显著延长。

10. 在La掺杂铈中，氧空位的形成不补偿电子空位。相反，它导致形成一个Ce3+离子以及一个氧空位，允许两种缺陷同时存在于材料中。
