[1] "Given that the (111) surface is the most stable surface of bulk ceria [11] and is predominant in nanoparticles, it is worth investigating how the reactivity of this surface can be enhanced."
[2] "In fact, it is now clear that doping of ceria with other metal cations is one potentially fruitful means of achieving this enhancement [13-18]."
[3] "In this paper, we apply first principles density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) [27, 28], to study La doping of ceria."
[4] "When the (111) and (110) ceria surfaces are doped with La, the most stable defect is La Ce + O· O with an oxygen hole."
[5] "We compute that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can be present."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. In this context, the ΔEv acts as a barrier that needs to be overcome for the reaction to proceed. Lower ΔEv values indicate a higher reactivity of the oxide surface, which correlates with both enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This is because a reduced ΔEv allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, facilitating the oxidation process.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its ability to influence the ease of oxygen vacancy formation. Lower ΔEv values suggest that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy creation is minimized, thereby increasing the probability of oxygen vacancy formation. This, in turn, enhances the surface's ability to participate in oxidation reactions efficiently. Consequently, surfaces with lower ΔEv values exhibit higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to the increased availability of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the redox reactions involved in oxidation processes.

1. 桑-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来推动反应。在此背景下，ΔEv充当需要克服的障碍以促进反应。较低的ΔEv值表示氧化物表面的活性较高，这与催化活性和氧化能力增强有关。这是因为较低的ΔEv值意味着氧空位形成的能量壁垒减小，从而增加了氧空位形成的概率。因此，表面的催化活性和氧化能力因表面的氧空位可获得性增加而增强。

2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性在于它对氧空位形成能垒的影响。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位形成的能量壁垒减小，从而增加了氧空位形成的可能性。反过来，这增强了表面参与氧化反应的能力。因此，具有较低ΔEv值的表面显示出更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为表面有更多可用的氧空位，这对于涉及氧化过程的还原-氧化反应至关重要。
