[1] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."
[2] "Formation of an oxygen vacancy results in the appearance of a reduced Ce3+ cation and a compensated oxygen hole, instead of compensation of both oxygen holes, which is typical of metal oxides doped with lower valence cations."
[3] "We tentatively suggest that the key role in the formation of this unusual defect is played by cerium and arises from the ease with which cerium can be reduced, as compared to other metal oxides."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactant molecule, requiring activation energy for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy barrier influences the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. In ceria surfaces doped with La, the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which enhances vacancy formation over the undoped surface. The key role in the formation of the unique defect is attributed to cerium due to its ease of reduction compared to other metal oxides.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面氧向反应分子的转移来运作，需要激活能量（ΔEv）来形成氧空位。这个能量壁垒影响了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在镧掺杂的铈表面上，形成氧空位所需的能量至少为0.90 eV（111）和0.64 eV（110），这增强了与未掺杂表面相比的空位形成。形成这种独特缺陷的关键作用归因于铈，因为它与其他金属氧化物相比更容易还原。

[1] "Given that the (111) surface is the most stable surface of bulk ceria [11] and is predominant in nanoparticles, it is worth investigating how the reactivity of this surface can be enhanced."
[2] "In fact, it is now clear that doping of ceria with other metal cations is one potentially fruitful means of achieving this enhancement [13-18]."
[3] "In this paper, we apply first principles density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) [27, 28], to study La doping of ceria."
[4] "When the (111) and (110) ceria surfaces are doped with La, the most stable defect is La Ce + O· O with an oxygen hole."
[5] "We compute that the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which is small enough that vacancy formation will be enhanced over the undoped surface and under favourable temperature and conditions, reduced Ce3+ ions can be present."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. In this context, the ΔEv acts as a barrier that needs to be overcome for the reaction to proceed. Lower ΔEv values indicate a higher reactivity of the oxide surface, which correlates with both enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This is because a reduced ΔEv allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, facilitating the oxidation process.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its ability to influence the ease of oxygen vacancy formation. Lower ΔEv values suggest that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy creation is minimized, thereby increasing the probability of oxygen vacancy formation. This, in turn, enhances the surface's ability to participate in oxidation reactions efficiently. Consequently, surfaces with lower ΔEv values exhibit higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to the increased availability of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the redox reactions involved in oxidation processes.

1. 桑-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来推动反应。在此背景下，ΔEv充当需要克服的障碍以促进反应。较低的ΔEv值表示氧化物表面的活性较高，这与催化活性和氧化能力增强有关。这是因为较低的ΔEv值意味着氧空位形成的能量壁垒减小，从而增加了氧空位形成的概率。因此，表面的催化活性和氧化能力因表面的氧空位可获得性增加而增强。

2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性在于它对氧空位形成能垒的影响。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位形成的能量壁垒减小，从而增加了氧空位形成的可能性。反过来，这增强了表面参与氧化反应的能力。因此，具有较低ΔEv值的表面显示出更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为表面有更多可用的氧空位，这对于涉及氧化过程的还原-氧化反应至关重要。

[1] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."
[2] "The origin for this lies in the crystal faces that are exposed on these structures. Nanoparticles expose primarily (111) faces,while nanorods expose primarily (110) faces."
[3] "Recent experimental work has shown that many metal dopants enhance the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria."
[4] "In this approach, the value of U must be somehow chosen; our earlier work arrived at U = 5 eV, based on comparison of the photoemission spectrum of reduced ceria and the computed density of states."
[5] "With no U on oxygen, the O2 binding energy is overestimated by 1.4 eV. With U = 7 eV on O 2p, the computed binding energy of 4.91 eV is rather close to the experimental data."
[6] "The formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."
[7] "In the present example, substitution of Ce4+ with La3+ results in formation of an La/ Ce + O· O defect centre, with an oxygen hole."
[8] "With no U on oxygen, there are two sets of LaO distances,three at 2.36 A and another three at 2.37 A; the former La O distances involve terminating surface oxygen atoms and the latter distances involve subsurface oxygen atoms and both are rather similar to the CeO distances in the surface."
[9] "With U O 2p, there is a notable distortion present. The LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms elongate to 2.52 A, while to subsurface oxygen atoms, the LaO distances are 2.46 A."
[10] "With U on oxygen, there is a strong distortion present. The LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms elongate to 2.61 A, while to subsurface oxygen atoms, the LaO distances are 2.50 A."
[11] "In the (111) surface, this gives LaO distances of 2.52 A to terminal oxygen atoms and 2.46 A to subsurface oxygen atoms."
[12] "On the (110) surface, this results in two surface LaO distances of 2.60 A and 2.50 A to one pair of surface oxygen atoms (very similar to one La dopant in the surface) and two surface LaO distances of 2.41 A."
[13] "The finding that oxygen vacancy formation on ceria surfaces doped with La results in formation of Ce3+ and an oxygen hole seems at first surprising, since it is generally accepted that the formation of an oxygen vacancy defect compensates an aliovalent dopant with a lower oxidation state."
[14] "Cerium however is more easily reduced compared to the oxides listed above, and formation of an oxygen vacancy (with an appropriate value of U on Ce, as in the present paper) results in formation of reduced Ce3+."
[15] "Perhaps the most interesting finding is that oxygen vacancy formation does not compensate the electronic holes, but instead compensates one hole and produces one Ce3+ ion, so that both electronic holes and Ce3+ ions can be present in La-doped ceria."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the sequential oxidation of organic molecules on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen vacancy formation, which can facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity. The oxidizing ability is also influenced by ΔEv, as a lower value allows for easier oxygen incorporation, promoting oxidation reactions.

2. The ceria surface exposed primarily (111) faces due to the nature of the nanoparticles, while nanorods exposed primarily (110) faces. Many metal dopants were found to increase the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria, enhancing its catalytic properties.

3. The choice of U in the DFT + U approach is essential for accurately describing the electronic structure of the doped systems. Our earlier work determined U = 5 eV based on comparisons of the photoemission spectrum of reduced ceria and the computed density of states.

4. The binding energy of O2 is significantly overestimated by DFT without applying U on O 2p states. Using U = 7 eV on O 2p leads to a computed binding energy that closely matches experimental data, indicating the suitability of this approach for thermodynamic calculations.

5. The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in La-doped ceria surfaces is notably reduced compared to the undoped surfaces. This reduction suggests that the formation of oxygen vacancies is favored in doped ceria, potentially enhancing its reactivity and catalytic activity.

6. Substitution of Ce4+ with La3+ in ceria leads to the formation of an La/Ce + O·O defect center, characterized by an oxygen hole. This behavior is distinct from typical metal oxides, where oxygen vacancies usually compensate dopants with lower oxidation states.

7. In the undoped ceria (111) surface, LaO distances are found to be similar to CeO distances, indicating minimal distortion. In contrast, with U applied on oxygen, LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms elongate significantly.

8. The presence of U on O 2p states in the calculations leads to notable distortions in the La-doped ceria surfaces. Terminal oxygen atoms exhibit elongated LaO distances, while subsurface oxygen atoms show slightly reduced distances.

9. The geometry of La-doped ceria surfaces reveals that the La ion moves away from pairs of surface oxygen atoms, shortening the distance to the other pairs. This movement results in elongated LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms.

10. In La-doped ceria, oxygen vacancy formation does not compensate the electronic holes. Instead, it leads to the formation of one Ce3+ ion alongside an oxygen hole, allowing both defects to coexist in the material.

1. 罗斯-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面顺序氧化有机分子进行操作。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对催化剂表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv意味着较高的氧空位形成倾向，有助于反应物的吸附和活化，从而增强催化活性。氧的氧化能力也受到ΔEv的影响，较低值允许更轻松地整合氧气，促进氧化反应。

2. 由于纳米颗粒的性质，铈表面主要暴露（111）面，而纳米棒主要暴露（110）面。许多金属掺杂剂被发现增加了铈的氧空位形成能和活性，增强了其催化性能。

3. 在DFT + U方法中选择U至关重要，以准确描述掺杂系统的电子结构。我们之前的工作根据还原铈的光发射光谱和计算的密度状态比较确定U = 5 eV。

4. O2的结合能由DFT显著高估，没有在O 2p状态下应用U。使用U = 7 eV在O 2p上，计算的结合能与实验数据相当，表明这种方法适用于热力学计算。

5. 在La掺杂铈的表面中，氧空位的形成能相比未掺杂表面显著降低。这种减少表明在掺杂铈中形成氧空位的趋势增加，可能增强其活性和催化性能。

6. 将Ce4+替换为La3+在铈中导致形成La/Ce + O·O缺陷中心，特征为氧空位。这种行为与典型的金属氧化物不同，在这些氧化物中，氧空位通常补偿具有较低氧化状态的掺杂剂。

7. 在未掺杂的铈（111）表面上，LaO距离类似于CeO距离，表明几乎没有失真。相比之下，在应用U到氧上的计算中，终端氧原子附近的LaO距离显著延长。

8. 在La掺杂铈中，应用U到O 2p状态导致铈表面的明显畸变。终端氧原子的LaO距离显著延长，而亚表面氧原子的LaO距离略有减小。

9. 在La掺杂铈表面上，La离子从一组表面氧原子移动，缩短到另一组的距离。这导致终端氧原子附近的LaO距离显著延长。

10. 在La掺杂铈中，氧空位的形成不补偿电子空位。相反，它导致形成一个Ce3+离子以及一个氧空位，允许两种缺陷同时存在于材料中。

[17] "For the (110) surface, the LaLa distribution in figure 4(b), in which the dopants are separated by 5.47 A, is the most stable."
[18] "Next, we remove an oxygen atom from these dopant structures and compute the oxygen vacancy formation energy if this quantity is negative, then the vacancy forms to compensate the dopants, otherwise, the stable defect is the La Ce + O· O hole."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the surface to the reactant molecules, enabling the formation of reactive intermediates that can then proceed to form products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as a lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, which can enhance the reactivity and efficiency of the oxide catalyst.

2. In ceria surfaces doped with La, the most stable defect is La Ce + O· O with an oxygen hole. The formation of an oxygen hole is confirmed through structural and electronic data. The energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), indicating that vacancy formation is enhanced over the undoped surface and can lead to the presence of both Ce3+ ions and oxygen holes in La-doped ceria.
