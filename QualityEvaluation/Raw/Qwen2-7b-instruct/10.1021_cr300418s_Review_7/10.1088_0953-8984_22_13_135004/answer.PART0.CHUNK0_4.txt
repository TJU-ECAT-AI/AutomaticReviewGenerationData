1. Ceria is significant in oxidation-reduction catalysis, intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, and gas sensing. It is crucial to investigate how the reactivity of the (111) surface, the most stable surface of bulk ceria, can be enhanced.

2. The energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface, when calculated using the DFT + U approach, is 1.18 eV, contrasting with 1.58 eV when no U is applied to oxygen.

3. There is a suggestion that additional experiments are required to delve deeper into this subject.

4. When ceria surfaces are doped with lanthanum, the most stable defect is the La Ce + O· O defect with an oxygen hole. Oxygen vacancy formation does not fully compensate for the electronic holes, instead producing a Ce3+ ion alongside the oxygen hole.

1. 氧化还原催化、中间温度固体氧化物燃料电池和气体传感等领域中，铈氧化物（铈）具有重要性。值得探究如何增强该表面的活性。

2. 使用DFT + U方法计算得到，在（110）表面形成一个氧空位的能量是1.18 eV，而没有在氧上应用U时为1.58 eV。

3. 建议进行更多实验以深入研究此领域。

4. 当铈氧化物表面掺杂镧时，最稳定的缺陷是La Ce + O· O缺陷，伴有氧空位。氧空位的形成不会完全补偿电子空位，而是产生一个Ce3+离子与氧空位共存。
