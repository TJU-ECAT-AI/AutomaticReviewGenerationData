[1] "Given that the (111) surface is the most stable surface of bulk ceria [11] and is predominant in nanoparticles, it is worth investigating how the reactivity of this surface can be enhanced."
[2] "The origin for this lies in the crystal faces that are exposed on these structures. Nanoparticles expose primarily (111) faces, while nanorods expose primarily (110) faces."
[3] "In the modelling, we study La doping of the (111) and (110) ceria surfaces."
[4] "The DFT + U approach has been shown to provide a consistent treatment of reduced Ce ions in ceria, e.g. [11, 12, 29, 30]."
[5] "In this approach, the value of U must be somehow chosen; our earlier work arrived at U = 5 eV, based on comparison of the photoemission spectrum of reduced ceria [31] and the computed density of states [10] and we choose it for this work."
[6] "We compute the formation energy of one oxygen vacancy in the (110) surface used in this paper is computed to be 1.18 eV, which compares with 1.58 eV for no U on oxygen."
[7] "For the oxides, we compute the formation energy of CeO2 to be 11.84 eV, which is in reasonable agreement with experimental data [1, 51]."
[8] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in doped ceria is given by (for the example of the (111) surface) Evac = [E(La0.016Ce1.984O1.992) + E(1/2O2)] E(La0.016Ce1.984O2)"
[9] "With no U on oxygen, there are two sets of LaO distances, three at 2.36 A and another three at 2.37 A; the former La O distances involve terminating surface oxygen atoms and the latter distances involve subsurface oxygen atoms and both are rather similar to the CeO distances in the surface."
[10] "However, with U O 2p, there is a notable distortion present. The LaO distances to terminal oxygen atoms elongate to 2.52 A, while to subsurface oxygen atoms, the LaO distances are 2.46 A. These LaO distances are substantially elongated compared to the CeO distances in the undoped surface, with the stronger elongation to the terminal oxygen atoms."
[11] "With no U on oxygen, there are 4 LaO distances of 2.48 A involving surface O and two of 2.34/2.35 A. The presence of the large La ion forces longer cationO distances in the vicinity of the dopant."
[12] "With U on oxygen, there is a strong distortion there is one strongly elongated surface LaO distance of 2.61 A and another at 2.51 A; the remaining two surface LaO distances are reduced to 2.38/2.39 A, consistent with the La cation moving away from one pair of surface oxygen atoms, thus shortening the distance to the other pair of surface oxygen atoms."
[13] "In the PEDOS we see firstly that there are no Ce 4f derived gap states in the band gap, confirming no reduced Ce3+ ions are present."
[14] "Secondly, the PEDOS shows two peaks of significance. The first is 4.5 eV below the Fermi level, in the valence band region, and the second is at 1.3 eV above the Fermi level (set at 0 eV)."
[15] "For two La dopants at each surface, there are a number of possible distributions."
[16] "For the (111) surface, the LaLa distribution shown in figure 4(a), in which the dopants are separated by 6.70 A, is the most stable."
[17] "For the (110) surface, the LaLa distribution in figure 4(b), in which the dopants are separated by 5.47 A, is the most stable."
[18] "Next, we remove an oxygen atom from these dopant structures and compute the oxygen vacancy formation energy if this quantity is negative, then the vacancy forms to compensate the dopants, otherwise, the stable defect is the La Ce + O· O hole."
[19] "For the (111) surface, the most stable oxygen vacancy site is shown in figure 7(a); the missing oxygen atom was coordinated to La and there is an energy cost of 0.90 eV to form this vacancy."
[20] "For the (110) surface, the most stable oxygen vacancy site is shown in figure 7(c); the missing oxygen atom was coordinated to La and there is an energy cost of 0.64 eV to form this vacancy."
[21] "In essence, these dopant distributions provide two isolated La dopants and oxygen holes."
[22] "In this structure, the surface oxygen atoms neighbouring the vacancy site move towards the vacancy, distorting the structure around the vacancy site and shortening the surface LaO distances to 2.332.32 A."
[23] "On the (111) surface, this gives LaO distances of 2.52 A to terminal oxygen atoms and 2.46 A to subsurface oxygen atoms."
[24] "The finding that oxygen vacancy formation on ceria surfaces doped with La results in formation of Ce3+ and an oxygen hole seems at first surprising, since it is generally accepted that the formation of an oxygen vacancy defect compensates an aliovalent dopant with a lower oxidation state."
[25] "We suggest that new experiments are needed to study this area is more detail."
[26] "With no experimental information available to compare with our findings, we tentatively suggest that our results can be best understood when we consider the nature of the host oxide."
[27] "In MgO, Mg is not reducible upon formation of an oxygen vacancy and forms instead F-centres, which are localized at the vacancy site."
[28] "Similarly, Zr in zirconia is not easily reducible and oxygen vacancy formation is trivalent doped zirconia will not reduce the Zr cation."
[29] "Cerium however is more easily reduced compared to the oxides listed above, and formation of an oxygen vacancy (with an appropriate value of U on Ce, as in the present paper) results in formation of reduced Ce3+."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the surface to the reactant molecules, enabling the formation of reactive intermediates that can then proceed to form products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as a lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, which can enhance the reactivity and efficiency of the oxide catalyst.

2. In ceria surfaces doped with La, the most stable defect is La Ce + O· O with an oxygen hole. The formation of an oxygen hole is confirmed through structural and electronic data. The energy required to form an oxygen vacancy in this structure is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), indicating that vacancy formation is enhanced over the undoped surface and can lead to the presence of both Ce3+ ions and oxygen holes in La-doped ceria.

1. 汪-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面向反应分子转移电子，从而促进中间体的形成，这些中间体可以进一步形成产物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）显著影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，较低的ΔEv表明氧空位形成的可能性更高，这可以增强氧化物催化剂的活性和效率。

2. 在镧掺杂的铈表面中，最稳定的缺陷是La Ce + O· O，带有氧空位。通过结构和电子数据确认了氧空位的形成。在(111)表面上形成氧空位所需的能量至少为0.90 eV，在(110)表面上为0.64 eV，这表明与未掺杂的表面相比，空位形成得到增强，并且可以在镧掺杂的铈中同时存在铈3+离子和氧空位。
