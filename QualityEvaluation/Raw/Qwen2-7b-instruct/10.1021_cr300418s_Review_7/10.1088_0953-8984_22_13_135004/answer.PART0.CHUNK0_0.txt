[1] "Ceria already has a relatively small oxygen vacancy formation energy, which has its origin in the ease with which cerium can change oxidation state from (formally) +4 to (formally) +3."
[2] "Formation of an oxygen vacancy results in the appearance of a reduced Ce3+ cation and a compensated oxygen hole, instead of compensation of both oxygen holes, which is typical of metal oxides doped with lower valence cations."
[3] "We tentatively suggest that the key role in the formation of this unusual defect is played by cerium and arises from the ease with which cerium can be reduced, as compared to other metal oxides."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactant molecule, requiring activation energy for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy barrier influences the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. In ceria surfaces doped with La, the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy is at least 0.90 eV on (111) and 0.64 eV on (110), which enhances vacancy formation over the undoped surface. The key role in the formation of the unique defect is attributed to cerium due to its ease of reduction compared to other metal oxides.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面氧向反应分子的转移来运作，需要激活能量（ΔEv）来形成氧空位。这个能量壁垒影响了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在镧掺杂的铈表面上，形成氧空位所需的能量至少为0.90 eV（111）和0.64 eV（110），这增强了与未掺杂表面相比的空位形成。形成这种独特缺陷的关键作用归因于铈，因为它与其他金属氧化物相比更容易还原。
