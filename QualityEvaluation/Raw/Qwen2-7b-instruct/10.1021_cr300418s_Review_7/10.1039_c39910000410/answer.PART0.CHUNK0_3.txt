[1] "Direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide over partially reduced cerium oxide are demonstrated, even at room temperature, by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy."
[2] "In general, CO is not activated as readily on oxides as it is on metal catalysts; accordingly, CO dispropor- tionation on oxides at mild temperatures has been considered to be impossible."
[3] "Cerium oxide was obtained by the thermal decomposition of cerium hydroxide gel at 773 K in air for 3 h."
[4] "The above results demonstrated that the C02 was produced even at room temperature when CO reacts with the partially reduced cerium oxide."
[5] "This proved that the partially reduced cerium oxide can activate the CO dissocation even at mild temperatures, and accordingly the partially reduced surface underwent a redox cycle."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher probability of oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface. This mechanism allows for efficient conversion of reactants under mild conditions, facilitating various chemical transformations.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv意味着氧空位形成的可能性更高，从而增强了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制允许在温和条件下高效转化反应物，促进各种化学转变。
