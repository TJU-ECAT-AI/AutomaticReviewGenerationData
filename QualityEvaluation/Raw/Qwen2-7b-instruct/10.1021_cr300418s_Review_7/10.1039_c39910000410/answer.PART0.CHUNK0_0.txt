[1] "Direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide over partially reduced cerium oxide are demonstrated, even at room temperature, by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy."
[2] "In general, CO is not activated as readily on oxides as it is on metal catalysts; accordingly, CO dispropor- tionation on oxides at mild temperatures has been considered to be impossible."
[3] "The surface was reduced at 673 K in H2 prior to the CO adsorption, the possibility of CO oxidation by the surface oxygen was ruled out; therefore, the surface species of adsorbed CO2 was formed from the CO disproportionation reaction (2CO --+ C + CO2)."
[4] "The IR spectra of adsorbed CO on CeO2 (100-1000 K) are different from those over CeO2 (673-H). The intensities of these IR bands grew markedly when the CO adsorption temperature was elevated."
[5] "This proved that the partially reduced cerium oxide can activate the CO dissocation even at mild temperatures, and accordingly the partially reduced surface underwent a redox cycle."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and movement of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the ease with which the oxygen atoms can be removed from the surface, influencing the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. In the context of the document, the reduction of cerium oxide at 673 K in H2 creates a surface rich in oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the disproportionation of CO into C and CO2 at room temperature. As the temperature increases, the intensity of IR bands related to the adsorbed CO species increases, indicating enhanced activation of CO dissociation. The redox cycle of the partially reduced cerium oxide surface further supports its ability to undergo multiple oxidation-reduction reactions, contributing to its catalytic efficiency in oxide-catalyzed oxidation processes.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧空位的形成和移动来运行。氧空位在氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力中起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了表面氧原子被去除的容易程度，从而影响反应动力学和产物选择性。根据文档内容，在673 K下使用H2对铈氧化物进行还原，创建了一个富含氧空位的表面，这促进了室温下的CO分解为C和CO2。随着温度的升高，与吸附的CO物种相关的红外谱带的强度增加，表明CO解离的激活增强。部分还原的铈氧化物表面的氧化还原循环进一步支持其在氧化物催化氧化过程中的催化效率。
