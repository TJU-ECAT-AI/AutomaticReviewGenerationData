[1] "Direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide over partially reduced cerium oxide are demonstrated, even at room temperature, by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy."
[2] "In general, CO is not activated as readily on oxides as it is on metal catalysts; accordingly, CO dispropor- tionation on oxides at mild temperatures has been considered to be impossible."
[3] "The above results demonstrated that the C02 was produced even at room temperature when CO reacts with the partially reduced cerium oxide."
[4] "This proved that the partially reduced cerium oxide can activate the CO dissocation even at mild temperatures, and accordingly the partially reduced surface underwent a redox cycle."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a redox cycle involving the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences the rate at which OVs can be created and utilized during the oxidation process. In the context of the partially reduced cerium oxide discussed in the literature, the redox cycle includes steps where the oxide surface can reduce CO molecules, leading to their dissociation and disproportionation. This process is facilitated by the presence of oxygen vacancies, which are generated and consumed during the oxidation of CO to form CO2, thus demonstrating the activation of CO dissociation at mild temperatures.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物的还原周期运行。氧空位（OV）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）很重要，因为它影响了空位创建和利用的速度。在文献中讨论的部分还原铈氧化物的背景下，该红ox周期包括步骤，其中氧化物表面可以还原CO分子，导致它们的分解和不完全氧化。这一过程是通过利用氧空位实现的，这些氧空位在CO氧化为CO2的过程中产生并消耗，从而证明了在温和温度下激活CO分解的可能性。
