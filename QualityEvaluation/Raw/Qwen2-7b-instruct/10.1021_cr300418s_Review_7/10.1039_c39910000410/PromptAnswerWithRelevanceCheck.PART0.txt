[1] "Direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide over partially reduced cerium oxide are demonstrated, even at room temperature, by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy."
[2] "In general, CO is not activated as readily on oxides as it is on metal catalysts; accordingly, CO dispropor- tionation on oxides at mild temperatures has been considered to be impossible."
[3] "The surface was reduced at 673 K in H2 prior to the CO adsorption, the possibility of CO oxidation by the surface oxygen was ruled out; therefore, the surface species of adsorbed CO2 was formed from the CO disproportionation reaction (2CO --+ C + CO2)."
[4] "The IR spectra of adsorbed CO on CeO2 (100-1000 K) are different from those over CeO2 (673-H). The intensities of these IR bands grew markedly when the CO adsorption temperature was elevated."
[5] "This proved that the partially reduced cerium oxide can activate the CO dissocation even at mild temperatures, and accordingly the partially reduced surface underwent a redox cycle."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and movement of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the ease with which the oxygen atoms can be removed from the surface, influencing the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. In the context of the document, the reduction of cerium oxide at 673 K in H2 creates a surface rich in oxygen vacancies, which facilitates the disproportionation of CO into C and CO2 at room temperature. As the temperature increases, the intensity of IR bands related to the adsorbed CO species increases, indicating enhanced activation of CO dissociation. The redox cycle of the partially reduced cerium oxide surface further supports its ability to undergo multiple oxidation-reduction reactions, contributing to its catalytic efficiency in oxide-catalyzed oxidation processes.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a redox cycle involving the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences the rate at which OVs can be created and utilized during the oxidation process. In the context of the partially reduced cerium oxide discussed in the literature, the redox cycle includes steps where the oxide surface can reduce CO molecules, leading to their dissociation and disproportionation. This process is facilitated by the presence of oxygen vacancies, which are generated and consumed during the oxidation of CO to form CO2, thus demonstrating the activation of CO dissociation at mild temperatures.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of cerium oxide, the reduction process at 673 K creates a surface environment conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies. This facilitates the direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide (CO) even at room temperature, leading to the production of carbon and carbon dioxide. The mechanism involves the following steps: (1) Reduction of the cerium oxide in hydrogen (H2) at 673 K, (2) Activation of CO at the partially reduced surface, and (3) Formation of oxygen vacancies which enable the disproportionation of CO into carbon and carbon dioxide, thus demonstrating the significant impact of ΔEv on the efficiency and reactivity of the oxide surface in catalytic oxidation processes.
