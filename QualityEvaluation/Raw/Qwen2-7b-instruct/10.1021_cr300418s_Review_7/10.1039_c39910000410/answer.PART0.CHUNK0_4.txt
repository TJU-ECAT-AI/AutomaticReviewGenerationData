1. "Direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide over partially reduced cerium oxide are demonstrated, even at room temperature, by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy."
2. "Cerium oxide was obtained by the thermal decomposition of cerium hydroxide gel at 773 K in air for 3 h."
3. "The sample was reduced in H2 at 673 K for 1-4 h then dehydroxylated by evacuation at 1000 K for 30 min, to give CeO2 (673-H)."
4. "Fig. 1 shows the IR spectra followed after admission of CO at room temperature."
5. "Because the surface was reduced at 673 K in H2 prior to the CO adsorption, the possibility of CO oxidation by the surface oxygen was ruled out; therefore, the surface species of adsorbed C02 was formed from the CO disproportionation reaction (2CO --+ C + C02)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of cerium oxide, the reduction process at 673 K creates a surface environment conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies. This facilitates the direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide (CO) even at room temperature, leading to the production of carbon and carbon dioxide. The mechanism involves the following steps: (1) Reduction of the cerium oxide in hydrogen (H2) at 673 K, (2) Activation of CO at the partially reduced surface, and (3) Formation of oxygen vacancies which enable the disproportionation of CO into carbon and carbon dioxide, thus demonstrating the significant impact of ΔEv on the efficiency and reactivity of the oxide surface in catalytic oxidation processes.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）而运作。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。在铈氧化物的情况下，673 K的还原过程在氢（H2）中创建了一个有利于形成氧空位的表面环境。这使得即使在室温下也能直接分解和偏离碳一氧化碳（CO），导致碳和二氧化碳的产生。该机制涉及以下步骤：（1）在673 K下使用氢（H2）对铈氧化物进行还原，（2）激活在部分还原表面上的CO，（3）形成氧空位，从而使CO的偏离反应生成碳和二氧化碳，从而证明了ΔEv对氧化物表面催化氧化过程的效率和反应性的显著影响。
