[1] "Direct dissociation and disproportionation of carbon monoxide over partially reduced cerium oxide are demonstrated, even at room temperature, by Fourier-transform IR spectroscopy."
[2] "We have found that the CO hydrogenation over cerium oxide produces hydrocarbons rather than oxygen-containing compounds as over other oxides."
[3] "Cerium oxide was obtained by the thermal decomposition of cerium hydroxide gel at 773 K in air for 3 h."
[4] "The sample was reduced in H2 at 673 K for 1-4 h then dehydroxylated by evacuation at 1000 K for 30 min."
[5] "The bands in Fig. 1 were due to the adsorbed species formed from the CO disproportionation reaction (2CO --+ C + C02)."
[6] "It was also found that the band intensities increased with the reduction time of cerium oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. As ΔEv decreases, the ability of the oxide surface to form oxygen vacancies increases, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This mechanism allows for efficient oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between reactants and the oxide surface.

火星-范克列恩机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧空位的形成而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。随着ΔEv的降低，氧化物表面形成氧空位的能力增强，从而提高了催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制允许通过促进反应物与氧化物表面之间的电子转移，实现高效的氧化反应。
