[1] "From the model, it emerges that ferromagnets can be divided into type I and type II for high and low values of TC/μat,respectively."
[2] "When a laser pulse hits the sample of a type I material it creates an excitation, increasing the temperature of the electron system."
[3] "This two-step process is a consequence of the different temperature of the electron system in the first picosecond and thereafter."
[4] "An interesting observation is that by increasing the laser fluence or increasing the ambient temperature, in an intermediate range even type I materials show a double-step behaviour and can be converted to type II materials."
[5] "The full description given by Koopmans and coauthors allows for the prediction of the quantitative response of a ferromagnetic material characterized by asf and TC/μat."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by forming oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. These oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the extent to which the surface can facilitate the oxidation reaction, thereby affecting the catalytic efficiency and the ability of the oxide to oxidize substances effectively.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面上形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。这些氧空位在确定催化活性和氧化物表面的氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成的能量要求（ΔEv）决定了表面促进氧化反应的程度，从而影响催化效率和氧化物有效氧化物质的能力。
