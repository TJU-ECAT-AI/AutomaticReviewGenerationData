[1] "From the model, it emerges that ferromagnets can be divided into type I and type II for high and low values of TC/μat,respectively."
[2] "When a laser pulse hits the sample of a type I material it creates an excitation, increasing the temperature of the electron system. Strong spin scattering ensures fast equilibration of the spin and electron system."
[3] "In type II materials, with a low ratio of TC/μat, and therefore weaker magnetic coupling, after the laser pulse hits the sample, a very fast demagnetization in the first picosecond is followed by a slower demagnetization."
[4] "This two-step process is a consequence of the different temperature of the electron system in the first picosecond and thereafter."
[5] "An interesting observation is that by increasing the laser fluence or increasing the ambient temperature, in an intermediate range even type I materials show a double-step behaviour and can be converted to type II materials."
[6] "One of the consequences of spinorbit coupling in the solid-state material is that in some points of the Fermi surface the spin is not well defined and consists of a mixture of the dominant spin direction and a small part of the opposite one."
[7] "If an electron is scattered into such points by a phonon for example,there is a probability that the spin flips (Fig. 2a)."
[8] "Assuming this mechanism, Koopmans and coauthors estimated the values of asf for Ni and Co by ab initio calculations, and found that these values agreed very well with those used to describe the demagnetization curves."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability due to increased surface reactivity and adsorption capacity for reactants. However, the exact significance of ΔEv depends on the specific chemical properties and structure of the oxide material.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）发挥作用。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较高的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为这会增加表面的反应性和吸附反应物的能力。然而，ΔEv的具体意义取决于氧化物材料的具体化学性质和结构。
