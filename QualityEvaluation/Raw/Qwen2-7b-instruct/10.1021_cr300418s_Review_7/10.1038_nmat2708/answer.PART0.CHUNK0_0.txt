[1] "From the model, it emerges that ferromagnets can be divided into type I and type II for high and low values of TC/μat,respectively."
[2] "When a laser pulse hits the sample of a type I material it creates an excitation, increasing the temperature of the electron system."
[3] "Strong spin scattering ensures fast equilibration of the spin and electron system."
[4] "This two-step process is a consequence of the different temperature of the electron system in the first picosecond and thereafter."
[5] "An interesting observation is that by increasing the laser fluence or increasing the ambient temperature, in an intermediate range even type I materials show a double-step behaviour and can be converted to type II materials."
[6] "One of the consequences of spinorbit coupling in the solid-state material is that in some points of the Fermi surface the spin is not well defined and consists of a mixture of the dominant spin direction and a small part of the opposite one10."
[7] "Assuming this mechanism, Koopmans and coauthors estimated the values of asf for Ni and Co by ab initio calculations, and found that these values agreed very well with those used to describe the demagnetization curves."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv). This energy barrier determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, influencing the reaction rate and efficiency.
