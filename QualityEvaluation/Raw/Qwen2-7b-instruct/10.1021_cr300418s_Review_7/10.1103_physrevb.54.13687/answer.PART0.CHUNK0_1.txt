[1] "An aluminum defect in quartz has been studied by means of all-electron calculations based on the full-potential linearized-augmented-plane-wave method."
[2] "The Al impurity introduces levels between the bonding and nonbonding states of pure SiO 2 a quartz; these features are shown to derive from the formation of the Al-O chemical bond."
[3] "In this regard, we obtained insights from a parallel study of a-Al2O3, whose relevant results are also preliminarily discussed in the present work."
[4] "The dangling bond in the @AlO4) 1/2#2 unit is evenly shared among the four oxygen atoms adjacent to the defect, and no bias of the charge density around the impurity is observed."
[5] "A planar averaged potential energy curve for a light carrier ion e.g., Li 1, H 1), trapped in an optical channel of the defective quartz has been determined as a function of its location with respect to the aluminum position."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. The ΔEv determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically leads to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power, facilitating the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to proceed.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位（ΔEv）的形成释放的能量来驱动反应。ΔEv决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv通常导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力，通过降低反应进行所需的活化能来促进反应。
