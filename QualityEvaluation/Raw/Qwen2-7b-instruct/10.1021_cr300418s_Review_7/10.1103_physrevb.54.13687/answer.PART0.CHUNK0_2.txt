[1] "An aluminum defect in quartz has been studied by means of all-electron calculations based on the full-potential linearized-augmented-plane-wave method."
[2] "A comparative study of alumina, pure quartz, and Al-substituted quartz shows that the Al impurity introduces levels between the bonding and nonbonding states of pure SiO2 a quartz."
[3] "These features are shown to derive from the formation of the Al-O chemical bond."
[4] "The dangling bond in the @AlO4) 1/2#2 unit is evenly shared among the four oxygen atoms adjacent to the defect."
[5] "No bias of the charge density around the impurity is observed."
[6] "A planar averaged potential energy curve for a light carrier ion e.g., Li 1, H 1), trapped in an optical channel of the defective quartz has been determined as a function of its location with respect to the aluminum position."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运作。氧空位形成的能量要求决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv有助于更轻松地形成氧空位，增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
