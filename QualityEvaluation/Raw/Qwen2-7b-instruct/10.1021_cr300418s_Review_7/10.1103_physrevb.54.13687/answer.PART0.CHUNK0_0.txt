[I] "The most significant changes induced by the defect are represented by the occurrence of impurity states, prevalently located in the energy range between 25.0 and 24.0 eV, corresponding to p-like Al and O bonding orbitals."
[II] "The variations are strictly localized and involve the electronic structure around host atoms which are directly bonded to the extrinsic defect."
[III] "On the other hand, atoms sufficiently far away from the impurity are unaffected by the presence of Al."
[IV] "Moreover, the size of our system seems to be sufficiently large to minimize the interactions between neighboring defects."
[V] "Finally, an averaged potential-energy curve for a light carrier ion e.g., Li 1, H 1), trapped in an optical channel of the defective quartz and which does not perturb the host lattice during its motion, has been determined as a function of its location with respect to the Al position."

1. The impurity states caused by the Al substitution are primarily located in the energy range between 25.0 and 24.0 eV, involving p-like Al and O bonding orbitals.
2. The changes are confined to the electronic structure of the host atoms directly connected to the extrinsic defect.
3. Atoms that are sufficiently distant from the impurity are unaffected by its presence.
4. The system's size appears adequate to reduce the interactions between neighboring defects.
5. An average potential-energy curve for a light carrier ion, moving in an optical channel of the defective quartz without disturbing the lattice, has been established as a function of its position relative to the Al atom.

1. 由于Al替代产生的杂质状态主要位于25.0和24.0 eV之间的能量范围内，涉及p型Al和O键合轨道。
2. 变化仅限于直接与外在缺陷相连的宿主原子的电子结构。
3. 距离杂质足够远的原子不受其存在影响。
4. 系统的大小似乎足以减少相邻缺陷之间的相互作用。
5. 已确定一个轻载离子的平均势能曲线，该离子被困在有缺陷的石英中的光学通道中，并且在移动时不会扰动晶格，该曲线根据其相对于Al原子的位置函数。
