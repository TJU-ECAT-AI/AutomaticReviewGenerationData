1. Yim et al. claimed to provide direct evidence that the band-gap state of bulk-reduced rutile TiO2110-1 originates mainly from oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) rather than from Ti interstitials, contradicting previous findings.

2. The irradiation of the samples with electrons led to a linear increase in the gap-state area, but the density of Ob vac showed a highly nonlinear dependence, indicating the presence of other near-surface defects besides Ob vac.

3. The irradiation of the samples resulted in unintended additional changes to the near-surface region, implying that the contribution of various defect species to the gap state cannot be accurately disentangled.

4. In the experiment conducted by Yim et al. on the oxidized sample, multiple simultaneous changes occurred: removal of adsorbates such as O adatoms, creation of Ob vac, and creation of defects in the near-surface region, complicating the disentanglement of their individual contributions to the gap state.

5. In the experiment conducted by the authors, when the surface was nearly defect-free, the gap state retained 70% of its original intensity, suggesting that the gap state originates mainly from defects in the near-surface region, such as Ti interstitials.

1.Yim等人声称提供了直接证据，证明了批量还原的锐钛矿TiO2110-1的带隙状态主要源自氧空位（Ob vac）而非Ti空位，与之前的发现相矛盾。

2. 电子照射导致间隙态面积线性增加，而Ob vac密度显示出高度非线性依赖，表明除了Ob vac之外，样品中还存在其他近表面缺陷。

3. 电子照射导致样品近表面区域发生意外的额外变化，这表明各种缺陷物种对带隙状态的贡献无法准确区分。

4. Yim等人在氧化样本上的实验中，同时发生了多个变化：吸附物如O ad原子的去除、Ob vac的形成以及近表面区域缺陷的产生，这使得它们对带隙状态的独立贡献难以区分。

5. 在作者的实验中，当表面接近无缺陷时，带隙状态保持了其原始强度的70%，这表明带隙状态主要来源于近表面区域的缺陷，例如Ti空位。
