[1] "Yim et al. [5] started with four differently prepared samples: i.e., (i) a mildly reduced TiO2110 sample [red dot in Fig. 4(a) of [5]], (ii) a more reduced sample [dark blue dot in Fig. 4(a) of [5]], (iii) a hydroxylated sample [filled square in Fig. 4(b) of [5]], and (iv) an oxidized sample [filled circle in Fig. 4(b) of [5]]."
[2] "To disentangle surface and near-surface contributions to the gap state, Yim et al. irradiated two of the samples [(i) and (iv)] with low-energy electrons (75 eV, 1 mA, current density 0:2 mA=cm2) for total durations of up to 20 s to reduce the samples while monitoring the intensity of the gap state."
[3] "However, this crucial assumption made by Yim et al. is incorrect as documented by the authors very own experimental data."
[4] "While the gap-state area is found to increase linearly in time, the Ob vac density shows a highly nonlinear dependence."
[5] "The situation is even more complicated in the experiment by Yim et al. on the oxidized sample (iv) [see Fig. 4(b) of [5]]. Here, three parameters were changed simultaneously upon e irradiation: removal of adsorbates such as O adatoms, creation of Ob vac, and the creation of defects in the near-surface region (see above), all of which influence the gap state."
[6] "Since the gap state retained 70% of its original intensity when the surface was nearly defect-free, we concluded that the gap state originates mainly from defects in the near-surface region, e.g., Ti interstitials [1]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to our experiment, when the surface was nearly free of defects, the gap state retained 70% of its original intensity. This indicates that the gap state originates mainly from defects in the near-surface region, such as Ti interstitials, rather than from oxygen vacancies.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及氧空位（Ob vac）的形成。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。根据我们的实验，当表面几乎没有任何缺陷时，间隙状态保持了其原始强度的70%。这表明间隙状态主要源自近表面区域的缺陷，例如钛空位，而不是氧空位。
