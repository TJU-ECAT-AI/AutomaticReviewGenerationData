[1] "However, this crucial assumption made by Yim et al. is incorrect as documented by the authors very own experimental data."
[2] "While the gap-state area is found to increase linearly in time, the Ob vac density shows a highly nonlinear dependence."
[3] "Thus, indisputably, near-surface defects other than Ob vac are introduced to the sample by e irradiation."
[4] "Since the gap state retained 70% of its original intensity when the surface was nearly defect-free,we concluded that the gap state originates mainly from defects in the near-surface region, e.g., Ti interstitials."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between reactants and the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity of the oxide surface towards oxidation, as it allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can act as active sites for the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进反应物与氧化物表面之间的电子转移而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面对氧化过程具有更高的反应性，因为它允许更容易地形成氧空位，这些氧空位可以作为氧化过程中的活性位点。
