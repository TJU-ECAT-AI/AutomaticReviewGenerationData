[1] "However, this crucial assumption made by Yim et al. is incorrect as documented by the authors very own experimental data."
[2] "While the gap-state area is found to increase linearly in time, the Ob vac density shows a highly nonlinear dependence."
[3] "Thus, indisputably, near-surface defects other than Ob vac are introduced to the sample by e irradiation."
[4] "Since the gap state retained 70% of its original intensity when the surface was nearly defect-free,we concluded that the gap state originates mainly from defects in the near-surface region, e.g., Ti interstitials."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) in the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency and oxidation capability.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位（Ob vac）来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化剂的活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv有助于更容易地形成氧空位，从而增强催化剂的效率和氧化能力。
