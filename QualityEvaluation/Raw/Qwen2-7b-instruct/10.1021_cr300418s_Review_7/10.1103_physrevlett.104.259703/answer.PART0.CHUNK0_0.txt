[1] "However, this crucial assumption made by Yim et al. is incorrect as documented by the authors very own experimental data."
[2] "While the gap-state area is found to increase linearly in time, the Ob vac density shows a highly nonlinear dependence."
[3] "Thus, indisputably, near-surface defects other than Ob vac are introduced to the sample by e irradiation."
[4] "Hence, the additional defects are near-surface defects that are not directly visible in the STM images."
[5] "It is not possible to disentangle the various contributions to the gap state from this complex experiment."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more efficient oxygen migration and reaction facilitation on the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位（Ob vac）进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较高的ΔEv通常会导致增强的催化活性和氧化能力，因为这促进了表面更有效的氧迁移和反应促进。
