Recent DFT calculations in a repeated supercell geometry have provided results at variance with this picture: These calculations preserve the a-quartz symmetry, apart from an increase in the Al-O bond length compared to the Si-O bonds, and distribute the hole evenly over the four O neighbors of Al [21-23].
