[1] "Most known examples of DFT failure occur in systems containing transition-metal or rare-earth elements, due to the complicated electron correlation phenomena present in the d or f valence shells of these elements."
[2] "However, DFT is based on approximations whose range of validity is difficult to estimate, and it is therefore important to clarify the limitations of the theory and gain inspiration for improved density functionals by a careful study of the rare instances where the method fails."
[3] "The neutral substitutional Al impurity in a quartz (hereafter denoted as AlO40) is one of the most well-studied states of Al in silica."
[4] "Because of the presence of an unpaired electron the center can be detected with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and this technique, together with dielectric relaxation and acoustic loss experiments, has yielded much information about the electronic structure of the impurity."
[5] "The calculations were performed using the GAUSSIAN98 code [26] on a cluster constructed from the ideal a-quartz structure by placing the Al impurity at the center and including two near-neighbor shells of both O and Si."
[6] "As can be seen from the Mulliken spin populations in Table II, the B3LYP approximation distributes the spin density almost evenly among the four O neighbors of Al, while in the UHF approach, the spin is essentially localized on the O atom which has been pushed away from Al."
[7] "The predictions of the UHF approximation are quite accurate, while those arising from the B3LYP calculation are off by more than a factor of 4."
[8] "It was noted by Magagnini and co-workers that the barrier preventing lattice distortion in their repeated-cell calculation using the local spin-density approximation appeared to arise from the electrostatic energy terms (Hartree and ion-ion repulsions)."
[9] "However, this represents an unphysical property of the Hartree energy functional: A single particle does not interact with itself. In the UHF approach the self-interaction is exactly canceled by a corresponding self-exchange term."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to increased catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power due to the higher availability of active oxygen sites on the surface. However, the exact details regarding how ΔEv influences these properties are not specified in the provided literature and require further investigation.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更易形成氧空位，导致催化活性增加和更强的氧化能力，因为表面具有更多活性氧位点。然而，关于ΔEv如何影响这些性质的具体细节未在提供的文献中明确提及，需要进一步研究。
