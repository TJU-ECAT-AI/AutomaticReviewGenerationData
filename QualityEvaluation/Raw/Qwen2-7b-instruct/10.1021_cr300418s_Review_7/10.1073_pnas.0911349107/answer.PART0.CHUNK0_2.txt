[1] "Oxygen vacancies on metal oxide surfaces have long been thought to play a key role in the surface chemistry."
[2] "However, by comparing experimental and simulated scanning tunneling microscopy images and spectra,we show that oxygen vacancies act as trapping centers and are negatively charged."
[3] "We demonstrate that charging the defect significantly affects the reactivity by following the reaction of molecular oxygen with surface hydroxyl formed by water dissociation at the vacancies."
[4] "The interaction of O2 with OHb, on the other hand, is still a matter of controversy."
[5] "In stark contrast to the TPD results, previous calculations find H2O2 to be by far the most stable product."
[6] "We use STM to provide an additional experimental test of the picture that has emerged thus far."
[7] "Analysis of the images in Fig. 1 shows that before the reaction with O2 there were about 72 OHb species and 38 Ob-vacs."
[8] "With a starting point of 38 Ob-vacs and 72 OHb, we would expect each Ob-vac to yield one Oad (reaction 1) and each OHb to yield half an Oad (reaction 2), i.e., only 74 Oad in total compared to the 118 found in the experiment."
[9] "Using a hybrid HSE06 approach (10, 11), which is expected to describe more accurately than other functionals the electronic structure of metal oxides, we also predict that H2O2 is overwhelmingly the most stable product of the reaction between O2 and OHb."
[10] "It turns out that we can only model Oad as the most stable product when we allow excess electronic charge to accumulate at the Ob-vac and OHb."
[11] "The presence of extra electrons at Ob-vacOHb originates from occupation of additional 3d electron states arising from polaronic distortion at both Ob-vac and OHb sites."
[12] "Given the ease of electron transfer in TiO2 (18, 19) with reported barriers as low as 0.09 eV and mobilities as high as 5.24 × 102 cm2 V2 s1, it is reasonable to expect interstitial Ti (Tiint)-donated electrons to diffuse comparatively freely within the system (20)."
[13] "Recently, Tiint species have been suggested as the main origin of titania BGS (9) with negligible importance of Ob-vac (or OHb) sites."
[14] "For isolated Ob-vac, the BGS (and the associated Ti3 sites) are symmetrically localized at or immediately beneath the defect site (Fig. 3A)."
[15] "Following refs. 22 and 23, we assign the appearance of localized BGS, and the ensuing local rehybridization to the chemical reduction of specific Ti sites from their stoichiometric oxidation state (i.e., reduction from Ti4 to Ti3 in an oversimplified ionic model)."
[16] "For isolated Ob-vac, the BGS (and the associated Ti3 sites) are symmetrically localized at or immediately beneath the defect site (Fig. 3A)."
[17] "By comparing the formation energies of an isolated Ob-vac (5.11 eV) and a Tiint-coupled vacancy (2.72 eV), the simulations suggest a net stabilization of 2.39 eV for Ob-vac within the adopted simulation cell."
[18] "The concentration of Tiint modeled is about an order of magnitude higher than experimental estimates from the literature (20)."
[19] "Although we are unable to address directly the number of electrons globally transferred to the surface, we can make estimates based on the upper limit of reported Tiint concentration:2 × 1019 cm3, i.e., one per 800 TiO2 unit cells (20)."
[20] "During the acquisition of the STM image shown in Fig. 4A, the tip was immobilized at each point of the scan while tunneling current versus bias voltage (I-V) spectra were recorded."
[21] "The STM image in Fig. 4A was acquired at a sample bias of 2 V with a tunneling current of 0.03 nA. It clearly shows both OHb and Ob-vac as bright spots between bright Ti5c rows."
[22] "The current map at 2 V has a very different appearance. Ob-vac and OHb both appear as dark spots centered between two bright rows."
[23] "Bright features can be seen on the bright Ti5c rows and a correlation analysis (Fig. 4C) shows that these lie diagonally adjacent to the Ob-vacs in the positions of the second nearest Ti5c neighbors."
[24] "Each Ob-vac tends to be surrounded by one or two brighter features rather than four equally bright features."
[25] "Fig. 5 shows our STM and current map simulations of Ob-vac at 2 V and 2 V, respectively. These are derived from the HSE06 density of states."
[26] "The simulations at 2 V are similar to each other, the highest current being found at the Ob-vac (Fig. 5A, C, and E)."
[27] "In contrast, the simulations at 2 V are strongly dependent on the Ob-vac charge. For both Ob-vac(0) and Ob-vac1, the highest current is found in a spot (or spots) directly in line with the bridging O row, inconsistent with the experimental contrast."
[28] "The experimental distribution of the defect states is only reproduced in simulations of Ob-vac2 where the highest current is found on a second nearest Ti5c neighbor with little current along the Ob row."
[29] "The calculations indicate that when O2 reacts with Ob-vac2 (ΔGf  0.41 eV), O2 dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV) with ΔG  16.47 eV [Ob-vac2  Obg Oad2  Ob], consistent with experiments (1, 2)."
[30] "As for the reaction of O2 with OHb, we find that whereas formation of O2H2 from OHb2 is spontaneous (OHb2  O2g O2H2  Ob, ΔG  4.75 eV), the formation of H2O22 (ΔGf  1.02 eV) is strongly unfavoured with respect to Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV)."

1. Oxygen vacancies on metal oxide surfaces have long been thought to play a key role in the surface chemistry. They act as trapping centers and are negatively charged. Charging the defect significantly affects the reactivity by following the reaction of molecular oxygen with surface hydroxyl formed by water dissociation at the vacancies.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as active sites for oxygen adsorption and activation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv leads to higher activity and stronger oxidizing power because it facilitates easier oxygen adsorption and activation.

3. The ΔEv for oxygen vacancy formation influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate higher reactivity, as they enable more efficient oxygen adsorption and activation, leading to better catalytic performance.

4. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism relies on the presence of oxygen vacancies as active sites for the oxidative process. These vacancies facilitate the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecules, which then undergo further reactions to produce oxidized products. The ΔEv plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of this mechanism.

5. The ΔEv for oxygen vacancy formation is crucial in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism as it dictates the ease of oxygen molecule adsorption and activation. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher degree of reactivity, enabling more effective catalytic conversion and enhanced oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
