[1] "Even using a hybrid HSE06 approach (10, 11), which is expected to describe more accurately than other functionals the electronic structure of metal oxides, we also predict that H2O2 is over-whelmingly the most stable product of the reaction between O2 and OHb."
[2] "This result, which is inconsistent with the TPD data,mimics that found in previous simulations (5)."
[3] "The calculations indicate that when O2 reacts with Ob-vac2 (ΔGf  0.41 eV), O2 dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV) with ΔG  16.47 eV [Ob-vac2  Obg Oad2  Ob], consistent with experiments (1, 2)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen atoms are abstracted from organic compounds and recombined with oxygen vacancies or hydroxyl groups on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When oxygen molecules react with the oxide surface, they can either directly form water or generate oxygen vacancies, depending on the conditions. Oxygen vacancies act as electron traps and are negatively charged. They are crucial in the surface chemistry of metal oxides, especially in processes involving the reaction of oxygen with water and molecular oxygen. The presence of these vacancies affects the reactivity of the surface, influencing the pathways of reactions such as the formation of hydrogen peroxide or water from oxygen and hydroxyl groups. The energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the efficiency of these reactions, impacting the overall catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the oxide catalyst.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤进行操作，其中氧气原子从有机化合物中被抽取，并与氧化物表面的氧空位或羟基团重新组合。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。当氧气分子与氧化物表面反应时，它们可以形成水，或者生成氧空位，具体取决于条件。氧空位作为电子陷阱并带有负电荷。它们是金属氧化物表面化学的关键因素，特别是在氧气与水和分子氧反应的过程中。这些空位的存在影响表面的反应性，影响反应路径，如氧气与氢氧基团形成水或过氧化氢等过程。氧空位形成所需的能量壁垒（ΔEv）决定了这些反应的效率，从而影响氧化物催化剂的整体催化性能和氧化能力。
