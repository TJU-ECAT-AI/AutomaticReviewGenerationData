[1] "Even using a hybrid HSE06 approach (10, 11), which is expected to describe more accurately than other functionals the electronic structure of metal oxides, we also predict that H2O2 is over-whelmingly the most stable product of the reaction between O2 and OHb."
[2] "This result, which is inconsistent with the TPD data,mimics that found in previous simulations (5)."
[3] "The calculations indicate that when O2 reacts with Ob-vac2 (ΔGf  0.41 eV), O2 dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV) with ΔG  16.47 eV [Ob-vac2  Obg Oad2  Ob], consistent with experiments (1, 2)."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen atoms are abstracted from organic compounds and recombined with oxygen vacancies or hydroxyl groups on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When oxygen molecules react with the oxide surface, they can either directly form water or generate oxygen vacancies, depending on the conditions. Oxygen vacancies act as electron traps and are negatively charged. They are crucial in the surface chemistry of metal oxides, especially in processes involving the reaction of oxygen with water and molecular oxygen. The presence of these vacancies affects the reactivity of the surface, influencing the pathways of reactions such as the formation of hydrogen peroxide or water from oxygen and hydroxyl groups. The energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the efficiency of these reactions, impacting the overall catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the oxide catalyst.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and subsequent reaction of oxygen vacancies (Ob-vacancies) and surface hydroxyls (OHb). Before reacting with molecular oxygen (O2), there are approximately 72 OHb species and 38 Ob-vacancies. Each Ob-vacancy yields one oxygen adatom (Oad) upon reaction with O2, while each OHb yields half an Oad. However, in the experiment, about 118 new bright spots were observed on the Ti5c rows, suggesting that Oad is also formed from the reaction of O2 with OHb. The excess electronic charge is accumulated at the Ob-vac and OHb sites, which is critical for the formation of Oad. The spatial distribution of the associated 3d electronic density is drastically affected by the presence of extra electrons. For isolated Ob-vacancies, the band gap states (BGS) are localized beneath the defect site. After reacting with O2, 118 new bright spots are seen on the bright Ti5c rows, indicating the formation of Oad. When O2 reacts with Ob-vac2, it dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2. The formation of H2O22 is less favored compared to the formation of Oad2, highlighting the role of oxygen vacancies in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧空位（Ob-vacancies）和表面羟基（OHb）的形成和随后反应起作用。在与分子氧（O2）反应之前，大约有72个OHb物种和38个Ob-vacancies。每个Ob-vacancy会生成一个氧吸附原子（Oad），而每个OHb则生成半个Oad。然而，在实验中，大约在明亮的Ti5c行上观察到了118个新的明亮斑点，这表明Oad也是从O2与OHb的反应中形成的。多余的电子积累在Ob-vac和OHb的位点上对于形成Oad至关重要。额外的电子密度的空间分布受到额外电子存在的显著影响。对于孤立的Ob-vacancies，带隙状态（BGS）位于或直接位于缺陷位置下方。在与O2反应后，在明亮的Ti5c行上观察到了118个新的明亮斑点，这表明形成了Oad。当O2与Ob-vac2反应时，它会解离，填充空位并形成一个Oad2。形成H2O22相比于形成Oad2而言更为不利，这突出了氧空位在火星-克雷韦伦机制中的作用。

[3] "We demonstrate that charging the defect significantly affects the reactivity by following the reaction of molecular oxygen with surface hydroxyl formed by water dissociation at the vacancies."
[4] "The interaction of O2 with OHb, on the other hand, is still a matter of controversy."
[5] "In stark contrast to the TPD results, previous calculations find H2O2 to be by far the most stable product."
[6] "We use STM to provide an additional experimental test of the picture that has emerged thus far."
[7] "Analysis of the images in Fig. 1 shows that before the reaction with O2 there were about 72 OHb species and 38 Ob-vacs."
[8] "With a starting point of 38 Ob-vacs and 72 OHb, we would expect each Ob-vac to yield one Oad (reaction 1) and each OHb to yield half an Oad (reaction 2), i.e., only 74 Oad in total compared to the 118 found in the experiment."
[9] "Using a hybrid HSE06 approach (10, 11), which is expected to describe more accurately than other functionals the electronic structure of metal oxides, we also predict that H2O2 is overwhelmingly the most stable product of the reaction between O2 and OHb."
[10] "It turns out that we can only model Oad as the most stable product when we allow excess electronic charge to accumulate at the Ob-vac and OHb."
[11] "The presence of extra electrons at Ob-vacOHb originates from occupation of additional 3d electron states arising from polaronic distortion at both Ob-vac and OHb sites."
[12] "Given the ease of electron transfer in TiO2 (18, 19) with reported barriers as low as 0.09 eV and mobilities as high as 5.24 × 102 cm2 V2 s1, it is reasonable to expect interstitial Ti (Tiint)-donated electrons to diffuse comparatively freely within the system (20)."
[13] "Recently, Tiint species have been suggested as the main origin of titania BGS (9) with negligible importance of Ob-vac (or OHb) sites."
[14] "For isolated Ob-vac, the BGS (and the associated Ti3 sites) are symmetrically localized at or immediately beneath the defect site (Fig. 3A)."
[15] "Following refs. 22 and 23, we assign the appearance of localized BGS, and the ensuing local rehybridization to the chemical reduction of specific Ti sites from their stoichiometric oxidation state (i.e., reduction from Ti4 to Ti3 in an oversimplified ionic model)."
[16] "For isolated Ob-vac, the BGS (and the associated Ti3 sites) are symmetrically localized at or immediately beneath the defect site (Fig. 3A)."
[17] "By comparing the formation energies of an isolated Ob-vac (5.11 eV) and a Tiint-coupled vacancy (2.72 eV), the simulations suggest a net stabilization of 2.39 eV for Ob-vac within the adopted simulation cell."
[18] "The concentration of Tiint modeled is about an order of magnitude higher than experimental estimates from the literature (20)."
[19] "Although we are unable to address directly the number of electrons globally transferred to the surface, we can make estimates based on the upper limit of reported Tiint concentration:2 × 1019 cm3, i.e., one per 800 TiO2 unit cells (20)."
[20] "During the acquisition of the STM image shown in Fig. 4A, the tip was immobilized at each point of the scan while tunneling current versus bias voltage (I-V) spectra were recorded."
[21] "The STM image in Fig. 4A was acquired at a sample bias of 2 V with a tunneling current of 0.03 nA. It clearly shows both OHb and Ob-vac as bright spots between bright Ti5c rows."
[22] "The current map at 2 V has a very different appearance. Ob-vac and OHb both appear as dark spots centered between two bright rows."
[23] "Bright features can be seen on the bright Ti5c rows and a correlation analysis (Fig. 4C) shows that these lie diagonally adjacent to the Ob-vacs in the positions of the second nearest Ti5c neighbors."
[24] "Each Ob-vac tends to be surrounded by one or two brighter features rather than four equally bright features."
[25] "Fig. 5 shows our STM and current map simulations of Ob-vac at 2 V and 2 V, respectively. These are derived from the HSE06 density of states."
[26] "The simulations at 2 V are similar to each other, the highest current being found at the Ob-vac (Fig. 5A, C, and E)."
[27] "In contrast, the simulations at 2 V are strongly dependent on the Ob-vac charge. For both Ob-vac(0) and Ob-vac1, the highest current is found in a spot (or spots) directly in line with the bridging O row, inconsistent with the experimental contrast."
[28] "The experimental distribution of the defect states is only reproduced in simulations of Ob-vac2 where the highest current is found on a second nearest Ti5c neighbor with little current along the Ob row."
[29] "The calculations indicate that when O2 reacts with Ob-vac2 (ΔGf  0.41 eV), O2 dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV) with ΔG  16.47 eV [Ob-vac2  Obg Oad2  Ob], consistent with experiments (1, 2)."
[30] "As for the reaction of O2 with OHb, we find that whereas formation of O2H2 from OHb2 is spontaneous (OHb2  O2g O2H2  Ob, ΔG  4.75 eV), the formation of H2O22 (ΔGf  1.02 eV) is strongly unfavoured with respect to Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV)."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the use of oxygen vacancies on the metal oxide surface. These vacancies act as catalytic sites for the reactions. In the context of the document, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the availability of oxygen vacancies and the energy associated with their formation influence the efficiency of the reactions involving water and molecular oxygen.

2. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is profound. The document demonstrates that by analyzing the images and spectra from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it was revealed that oxygen vacancies do not exist in a neutral state as previously assumed. Instead, they act as trapping centers and are negatively charged. This finding significantly impacts the reactivity of the surface, as it influences the formation of various species during reactions with oxygen and water.

3. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the stability and reactivity of the oxide surface. In the reaction of oxygen with the oxide surface, the energy barrier associated with the formation of an oxygen vacancy affects the likelihood of successful dissociative adsorption of oxygen molecules. This, in turn, influences the rate and selectivity of the subsequent reactions involving water and molecular oxygen. Higher ΔEv values may lead to less active surfaces, while lower ΔEv values may facilitate faster and more efficient reactions, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

4. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) affects the spatial distribution of the bound electrons on the oxide surface. When oxygen vacancies are present, the excess electrons are not directly localized at the vacancy site but are found distributed across the surface. This distribution leads to a reorganization of the electronic structure of the oxide, affecting its chemical reactivity. The document shows that by allowing for the accumulation of excess electronic charge at oxygen vacancies and OHb sites, the most stable product of the reaction between oxygen and OHb becomes the formation of water and surface oxygen adatoms, in line with experimental observations.

5. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) also influences the reaction pathways and the stability of intermediate species formed during the oxidation process. In the case of the reaction between oxygen and OHb, the calculations indicate that the formation of hydrogen peroxide is energetically unfavorable compared to the formation of an oxygen adatom. This result is consistent with the experimental observations and underscores the role of ΔEv in determining the selective formation of certain products. The document supports the conclusion that the excess electronic charge at oxygen vacancies and OHb sites plays a crucial role in the reaction dynamics, guiding the pathway towards the formation of water and surface oxygen adatoms.

1. 罗斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式，通过利用金属氧化物表面的氧空位。这些空位作为反应的催化剂站点。根据文档，氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。具体而言，氧空位的可用性和形成它们的能量与水和分子氧反应有关，影响了反应的效率。

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。文档通过分析扫描隧道显微镜（STM）图像和光谱，揭示了氧空位并非如先前假设的那样处于中性状态，而是作为捕获中心并带有负电荷。这一发现对表面反应产生了重大影响，因为它影响了氧气与水和分子氧反应的过程。

3. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的稳定性和反应活性。在氧气与氧化物表面反应时，与氧空位形成相关的能量壁垒影响了氧分子成功进行离解吸附的可能性。这反过来影响了后续涉及水和分子氧的反应速率和选择性，增强了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

4. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）影响了氧化物表面的电子分布空间。当存在氧空位时，多余的电子不会直接集中在空位位置，而是在表面上分布开来。这种分布导致了氧化物电子结构的重排，影响其化学反应性。文档显示，通过允许在氧空位和OHb站点积累多余的电子电荷，氧气和OHb之间的反应中最稳定的产物是水和表面氧原子，与实验观察一致。

5. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）也影响了氧化过程中中间物种的生成路径和稳定性。在氧气与OHb反应的情况下，计算表明氢过氧化物的形成比形成氧原子的形成更不经济。这一结果与实验观察一致，并强调了ΔEv在确定特定产品形成路径方面的作用。文档支持结论，多余的电子电荷在氧空位和OHb站点上起着关键作用，指导反应动态，引导形成水和表面氧原子。
