[1] "These vacancies have been assumed to be neutral in calculations of the surface properties."
[2] "Analysis of the images in Fig. 1 shows that before the reaction with O2 there were about 72 OHb species and 38 Ob-vacs."
[3] "With a starting point of 38 Ob-vacs and 72 OHb, we would expect each Ob-vac to yield one Oad (reaction 1) and each OHb to yield half an Oad (reaction 2), i.e., only 74 Oad in total compared to the 118 found in the experiment."
[4] "This BGS coupling drastically affects both the energy and, as was the case for the HSE06 modeling for Ob-vac2 (Fig. 2), the spatial distribution of the BGS of Ob-vac."
[5] "The calculations indicate that when O2 reacts with Ob-vac2 (ΔGf  0.41 eV), O2 dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV) with ΔG  16.47 eV [Ob-vac2  Obg Oad2  Ob], consistent with experiments (1, 2)."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the use of oxygen vacancies on the metal oxide surface. These vacancies act as catalytic sites for the reactions. In the context of the document, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the availability of oxygen vacancies and the energy associated with their formation influence the efficiency of the reactions involving water and molecular oxygen.

2. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is profound. The document demonstrates that by analyzing the images and spectra from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it was revealed that oxygen vacancies do not exist in a neutral state as previously assumed. Instead, they act as trapping centers and are negatively charged. This finding significantly impacts the reactivity of the surface, as it influences the formation of various species during reactions with oxygen and water.

3. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the stability and reactivity of the oxide surface. In the reaction of oxygen with the oxide surface, the energy barrier associated with the formation of an oxygen vacancy affects the likelihood of successful dissociative adsorption of oxygen molecules. This, in turn, influences the rate and selectivity of the subsequent reactions involving water and molecular oxygen. Higher ΔEv values may lead to less active surfaces, while lower ΔEv values may facilitate faster and more efficient reactions, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

4. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) affects the spatial distribution of the bound electrons on the oxide surface. When oxygen vacancies are present, the excess electrons are not directly localized at the vacancy site but are found distributed across the surface. This distribution leads to a reorganization of the electronic structure of the oxide, affecting its chemical reactivity. The document shows that by allowing for the accumulation of excess electronic charge at oxygen vacancies and OHb sites, the most stable product of the reaction between oxygen and OHb becomes the formation of water and surface oxygen adatoms, in line with experimental observations.

5. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) also influences the reaction pathways and the stability of intermediate species formed during the oxidation process. In the case of the reaction between oxygen and OHb, the calculations indicate that the formation of hydrogen peroxide is energetically unfavorable compared to the formation of an oxygen adatom. This result is consistent with the experimental observations and underscores the role of ΔEv in determining the selective formation of certain products. The document supports the conclusion that the excess electronic charge at oxygen vacancies and OHb sites plays a crucial role in the reaction dynamics, guiding the pathway towards the formation of water and surface oxygen adatoms.

1. 罗斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式，通过利用金属氧化物表面的氧空位。这些空位作为反应的催化剂站点。根据文档，氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。具体而言，氧空位的可用性和形成它们的能量与水和分子氧反应有关，影响了反应的效率。

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。文档通过分析扫描隧道显微镜（STM）图像和光谱，揭示了氧空位并非如先前假设的那样处于中性状态，而是作为捕获中心并带有负电荷。这一发现对表面反应产生了重大影响，因为它影响了氧气与水和分子氧反应的过程。

3. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的稳定性和反应活性。在氧气与氧化物表面反应时，与氧空位形成相关的能量壁垒影响了氧分子成功进行离解吸附的可能性。这反过来影响了后续涉及水和分子氧的反应速率和选择性，增强了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

4. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）影响了氧化物表面的电子分布空间。当存在氧空位时，多余的电子不会直接集中在空位位置，而是在表面上分布开来。这种分布导致了氧化物电子结构的重排，影响其化学反应性。文档显示，通过允许在氧空位和OHb站点积累多余的电子电荷，氧气和OHb之间的反应中最稳定的产物是水和表面氧原子，与实验观察一致。

5. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）也影响了氧化过程中中间物种的生成路径和稳定性。在氧气与OHb反应的情况下，计算表明氢过氧化物的形成比形成氧原子的形成更不经济。这一结果与实验观察一致，并强调了ΔEv在确定特定产品形成路径方面的作用。文档支持结论，多余的电子电荷在氧空位和OHb站点上起着关键作用，指导反应动态，引导形成水和表面氧原子。
