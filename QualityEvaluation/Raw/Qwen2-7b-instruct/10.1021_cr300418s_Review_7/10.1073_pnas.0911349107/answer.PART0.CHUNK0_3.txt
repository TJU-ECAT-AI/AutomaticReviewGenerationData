[1] "The rutile TiO2110 surface, which we use as a model photoca- talytic system here, is displayed as a ball model in Fig. 1A. It is characterized by alternate rows of fivefold coordinated Ti (Ti5c) and bridging-O atoms (Ob) that run in the [001] direction."
[2] "The interaction of O2 with OHb, on the other hand, is still a matter of controversy."
[3] "With a starting point of 38 Ob-vacs and 72 OHb, we would expect each Ob-vac to yield one Oad (reaction 1) and each OHb to yield half an Oad (reaction 2), i.e., only 74 Oad in total compared to the 118 found in the experiment."
[4] "It turns out that we can only model Oad as the most stable product when we allow excess electronic charge to accumulate at the Ob-vac and OHb (see Fig. 2)."
[5] "The presence of extra electrons at Ob-vacOHb originates from occupation of additional 3d electron states arising from polaronic distortion at both Ob-vac and OHb sites."
[6] "In our calculations, regardless of the numb-er of electrons occupying the BGS [2 electrons (e) for Ob-vac(0),3e for Ob-vac1, 4e for Ob-vac2, 1e for OHb0, 2e for OHb1, 3e for OHb2] we find that the energy remains close to 1 eV below the CB onset (Fig. 2A)."
[7] "Recently, Tiint species have been suggested as the main origin of titania BGS (9) with negligible importance of Ob-vac (or OHb) sites."
[8] "For isolated Ob-vac, the BGS (and the associated Ti3 sites) are symmetrically localized at or immediately beneath the defect site (Fig. 3A)."
[9] "For one isolated Tiint (Fig. 3B), the calculations suggest an asymmetric localisation of the BGS at the Tiint site (one state) and on other separate, regular lattice Ti sites across the slab."
[10] "The presence of Tiint-donated electrons induces an electronic reorganization that moves electronic charge away from the vacancy site and the corresponding Ob row (Fig. 3C)."
[11] "When Tiint-donated electrons are modeled together with Ob-vac, hybridization between specific BGS (circled in Fig. 3C, E, and F) make Tiint-donated electrons available at the Ob-vac site thus locally charging Ob-vac with the extra electrons necessary to account for the additional Oad imaged in Fig. 1C."

1. The rutile TiO2110 surface, used as a model photocatalytic system, features alternating rows of fivefold coordinated titanium atoms and bridging oxygen atoms running in the [001] direction.
2. The interaction of oxygen with hydroxy groups is a topic of ongoing debate.
3. Based on the initial quantities, the expected total formation of oxygen adsorbates is 74, contrasting with the observed 118.
4. Excess electronic charge accumulating at oxygen vacancies and hydroxy groups allows the modeling of oxygen adsorbates as the most stable product.
5. Extra electrons at oxygen vacancies and hydroxy groups originate from 3d electron states due to polaronic distortion.
6. Regardless of the number of electrons occupying the band gap states, the energy remains approximately 1 eV below the conduction band onset.
7. Titanium interstitial species have been proposed as the primary source of band gap states in titania, with minimal contribution from oxygen vacancies or hydroxy groups.
8. Isolated oxygen vacancies exhibit symmetric localization of band gap states near the defect site.
9. An isolated titanium interstitial induces asymmetric localization of band gap states at its site and across the slab.
10. The presence of titanium interstitial-donated electrons leads to an electronic reorganization moving charge away from the vacancy site.
11. Hybridization between specific band gap states enables the availability of titanium interstitial-donated electrons at the oxygen vacancy site, facilitating its charging.
