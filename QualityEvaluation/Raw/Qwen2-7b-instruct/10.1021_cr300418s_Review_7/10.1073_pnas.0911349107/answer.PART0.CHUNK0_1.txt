[1] "The vast majority being Ob-vacancies and surface hydroxyls (OHb)."
[2] "Before the reaction with O2 there were about 72 OHb species and 38 Ob-vacs."
[3] "With a starting point of 38 Ob-vacs and 72 OHb, we would expect each Ob-vac to yield one Oad (reaction 1) and each OHb to yield half an Oad (reaction 2), i.e., only 74 Oad in total compared to the 118 found in the experiment."
[4] "We can only model Oad as the most stable product when we allow excess electronic charge to accumulate at the Ob-vac and OHb."
[5] "The extra electrons, however, drastically affect the spatial distribution of the associated 3d electronic density."
[6] "For isolated Ob-vac, the BGS (and the associated Ti3 sites) are symmetrically localized at or immediately beneath the defect site."
[7] "Following the reaction with O2, about 118 new bright spots are seen on the bright Ti5c rows."
[8] "The calculations indicate that when O2 reacts with Ob-vac2 (ΔGf  0.41 eV), O2 dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV) with ΔG  16.47 eV [Ob-vac2  Obg Oad2  Ob], consistent with experiments (1, 2)."
[9] "The formation of H2O22 (ΔGf  1.02 eV) is strongly unfavoured with respect to Oad2 (ΔGf  16.06 eV)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and subsequent reaction of oxygen vacancies (Ob-vacancies) and surface hydroxyls (OHb). Before reacting with molecular oxygen (O2), there are approximately 72 OHb species and 38 Ob-vacancies. Each Ob-vacancy yields one oxygen adatom (Oad) upon reaction with O2, while each OHb yields half an Oad. However, in the experiment, about 118 new bright spots were observed on the Ti5c rows, suggesting that Oad is also formed from the reaction of O2 with OHb. The excess electronic charge is accumulated at the Ob-vac and OHb sites, which is critical for the formation of Oad. The spatial distribution of the associated 3d electronic density is drastically affected by the presence of extra electrons. For isolated Ob-vacancies, the band gap states (BGS) are localized beneath the defect site. After reacting with O2, 118 new bright spots are seen on the bright Ti5c rows, indicating the formation of Oad. When O2 reacts with Ob-vac2, it dissociates, filling the vacancy and forming one Oad2. The formation of H2O22 is less favored compared to the formation of Oad2, highlighting the role of oxygen vacancies in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧空位（Ob-vacancies）和表面羟基（OHb）的形成和随后反应起作用。在与分子氧（O2）反应之前，大约有72个OHb物种和38个Ob-vacancies。每个Ob-vacancy会生成一个氧吸附原子（Oad），而每个OHb则生成半个Oad。然而，在实验中，大约在明亮的Ti5c行上观察到了118个新的明亮斑点，这表明Oad也是从O2与OHb的反应中形成的。多余的电子积累在Ob-vac和OHb的位点上对于形成Oad至关重要。额外的电子密度的空间分布受到额外电子存在的显著影响。对于孤立的Ob-vacancies，带隙状态（BGS）位于或直接位于缺陷位置下方。在与O2反应后，在明亮的Ti5c行上观察到了118个新的明亮斑点，这表明形成了Oad。当O2与Ob-vac2反应时，它会解离，填充空位并形成一个Oad2。形成H2O22相比于形成Oad2而言更为不利，这突出了氧空位在火星-克雷韦伦机制中的作用。
