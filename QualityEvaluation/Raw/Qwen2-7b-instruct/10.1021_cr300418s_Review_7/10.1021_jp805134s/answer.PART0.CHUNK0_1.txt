[1] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[2] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption over pure and Zr or Pd substituted surfaces were determined using the DFT+U method. This theoretical approach allows us to determine key electronic, structural and chemical characteristics of ceria surfaces on the atomic scale, less accessible to experiment."
[3] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[4] "Previous studies (13, 19-21) have illustrated the incorporation of Zr into the fluorite lattice of ceria, however we have neglected to consider the thermodynamic preference of Pd surface substitution, which will be addressed in future studies."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a more easily reducible surface, facilitating faster oxygen vacancy formation. This process enhances the reactivity of the oxide surface, promoting the oxidation of hydrocarbons, including methane. The significance of ΔEv lies in its correlation with the surface reducibility, which in turn affects the efficiency of the catalytic reaction.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物催化剂上的氧空位形成而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表示更易于还原的表面，促进了更快的氧空位形成。这一过程增强了氧化物表面的活性，促进甲烷等烃类物质的氧化。ΔEv的重要性在于其与表面可还原性的相关性，进而影响催化反应的效率。
