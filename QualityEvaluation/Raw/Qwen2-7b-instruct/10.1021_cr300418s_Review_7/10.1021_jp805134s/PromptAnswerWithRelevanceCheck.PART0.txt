The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen from the oxide surface to the substrate molecule, typically a hydrocarbon. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more easily reducible, meaning it can accept electrons more readily. This increased reductivity enhances the surface's ability to facilitate electron and oxygen transfer, thereby boosting its catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Consequently, the ΔEv serves as an indicator of the surface's efficiency in promoting oxidation reactions, with lower values correlating to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a more easily reducible surface, facilitating faster oxygen vacancy formation. This process enhances the reactivity of the oxide surface, promoting the oxidation of hydrocarbons, including methane. The significance of ΔEv lies in its correlation with the surface reducibility, which in turn affects the efficiency of the catalytic reaction.

[2] "The energetic preference of Zr to segregate to the surface versus bulk at these (low) dopant levels was not directly considered, however the range of vacancy formation energies spanning the bulk value suggests that segregation preferences for each surface termination are a function of atmospheric conditions."

[4] "For Pd-substituted ceria, vacancy formation and adsorption reduce surface Pd atoms instead of Ce, and thus the lack of occupied Ce 4f states leads to little influence of U value on energetics."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy, which facilitates the adsorption and oxidation of hydrocarbons. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's reactivity and thus increasing its catalytic efficiency for oxidation reactions.

2. The study highlights that the incorporation of metals like Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface can significantly reduce the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. This reduction not only decreases the energy barrier for methane adsorption but also lowers the reaction energy, thereby improving the overall catalytic activity of the ceria-based material.

3. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) and the reaction energy for methane adsorption are closely related, indicating that they are both indicators of the surface reducibility. A more exothermic ΔEv suggests better surface reducibility, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

4. The substitution of Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice affects the surface reducibility differently. For Zr-substituted surfaces, the formation of oxygen vacancies is more energetically favorable, which correlates with a decrease in the activation energy for methane adsorption. In contrast, Pd incorporation reduces the energy of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption more significantly, as Pd atoms are reduced instead of Ce atoms.

5. Dissociative methane adsorption is a surface reduction process, and its exothermicity is influenced by the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface. Surfaces that are pre-reduced due to the presence of oxygen vacancies exhibit a lower exothermicity for methane adsorption, implying that the formation of oxygen vacancies can modulate the catalytic activity of the ceria-based material by altering the energetics of methane adsorption.

1. 罗斯-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧空位的形成，这促进了烃类的吸附和氧化。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更低的ΔEv表明氧空位更易于形成，从而增强表面活性，提高其氧化反应的催化效率。

2. 研究表明，将金属如Zr或Pd掺入铈亚晶格的表面可以显著降低氧空位形成的能量。这不仅降低了甲烷吸附的能量壁垒，也降低了反应能量，从而提高了铈基材料的整体催化活性。

3. 氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）和甲烷吸附的反应能量之间存在密切关系，表明它们都是表面可还原性的指标。更高的ΔEv表明更好的表面可还原性，导致增强的催化活性。

4. 铈亚晶格中Zr或Pd的掺杂对表面可还原性产生不同的影响。对于Zr掺杂的表面，氧空位的形成更加有利，与甲烷吸附的活化能的降低相吻合。相比之下，Pd掺入显著降低了氧空位形成和甲烷吸附的能量，因为Pd原子被还原而不是铈原子。

5. 分解甲烷吸附是一个表面还原过程，其热效应受到表面氧空位形成的影响。表面由于氧空位的存在而预先还原时，甲烷吸附的热效应较低，表明氧空位的形成可以通过调节甲烷吸附的热力学性质来调节铈基材料的催化活性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies higher surface reducibility, facilitating more efficient oxygen migration and adsorption, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface. The presence of metals like Zr or Pd in the ceria lattice can reduce ΔEv, thereby lowering the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption, contributing to improved catalytic performance.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy as a crucial step. This process releases electrons that are then transferred to the reactants, enhancing their reactivity. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower ΔEv values are more easily reducible and thus more active in catalysis. 

2. The thermodynamics of dissociative methane adsorption on the surfaces correlates with the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. This means that the more exothermic the oxygen vacancy formation, the more favorable it is for methane to adsorb dissociatively, releasing hydrogen and a methyl radical. 

3. The presence of Pd in ceria surfaces results in greater reduction of the surface and thus more exothermic adsorption energies, even though Pd atoms themselves are not directly bonded to the adsorbed species. This indicates that Pd incorporation enhances the overall reducibility of the surface.

4. The choice of the Hubbard U-term in the DFT+U method influences the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption differently for ceria surfaces depending on whether they contain Zr or Pd. For Zr-substituted surfaces, the U value affects the reduction of surface Ce atoms, leading to a strong dependence on U. However, for Pd-substituted surfaces, the U value impacts the reduction of surface Pd atoms instead, resulting in a lesser influence on energetics.

5. After oxygen vacancy formation, the surfaces undergo reduction of surface and subsurface Ce4+ ions. This is confirmed by Bader charge analysis and projected density of states (PDOS), indicating that the vacancy formation process leads to a reduction of the surface metal atoms.

1. 马斯-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过需要形成氧空位作为关键步骤来运行。这个过程释放出电子，这些电子随后转移到反应物上，增强其活性。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。具有较低ΔEv值的表面更容易还原，因此在催化作用中更为活跃。

2. 甲烷在表面的吸附热力学与氧空位形成的能态相关。这意味着氧空位形成越放热，甲烷以解离形式吸附的可能性就越大，释放氢原子和一个甲基自由基。

3. 在铈氧化物表面上掺入钯会导致表面更易于还原，即使钯原子本身并未直接与吸附物种结合，也导致吸附能显著增加。这表明钯掺杂增强了表面的整体还原性。

4. 在使用DFT+U方法时，Hubbard U参数的选择对铈氧化物表面的氧空位形成能和甲烷吸附能的影响因是否含有锆或钯而异。对于锆掺杂的表面，U值会影响表面铈原子的还原，导致对U的强依赖性。然而，对于钯掺杂的表面，U值影响的是表面钯原子的还原，从而导致对能量影响的较小影响。

5. 在形成氧空位后，表面经历了表面和亚表面铈4+离子的还原。这一过程通过鲍德电荷分析和投影密度泛函（PDOS）得到证实，表明空位形成过程导致表面金属原子的还原。
