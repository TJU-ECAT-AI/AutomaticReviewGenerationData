[1] "Oxygen vacancy formation is more exothermic for Zr and Pd substituted ceria surfaces than for pure ceria, with Pd-substituted surfaces being significantly more reducible."
[2] "Methane adsorbs dissociatively as *H and *CH3, and the thermodynamics of dissociative methane adsorption correlate with those of oxygen vacancy formation over the pure and substituted surfaces."
[3] "Adsorption is substantially more exothermic than over pure ceria due to the greater reducibility of the Pd-containing surfaces, despite no direct bonding of CH3 or H species with Pd atoms."
[4] "Vacancy formation and adsorption on pure or Zr-substituted ceria reduces surface Ce atoms by Ce 4f occupation, leading to strong dependence of ΔEads and ΔEvac on the value of U. For the Pd-substituted ceria, vacancy formation and adsorption reduce surface Pd atoms instead of Ce, and thus the lack of occupied Ce 4f states leads to little influence of U value on energetics."
[5] "Adsorption on both surfaces results in reduction of surface and/or subsurface Ce4+ ions which were previously unreduced by vacancy formation, confirmed by Bader charges and PDOS."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy as a crucial step. This process releases electrons that are then transferred to the reactants, enhancing their reactivity. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower ΔEv values are more easily reducible and thus more active in catalysis. 

2. The thermodynamics of dissociative methane adsorption on the surfaces correlates with the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. This means that the more exothermic the oxygen vacancy formation, the more favorable it is for methane to adsorb dissociatively, releasing hydrogen and a methyl radical. 

3. The presence of Pd in ceria surfaces results in greater reduction of the surface and thus more exothermic adsorption energies, even though Pd atoms themselves are not directly bonded to the adsorbed species. This indicates that Pd incorporation enhances the overall reducibility of the surface.

4. The choice of the Hubbard U-term in the DFT+U method influences the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption differently for ceria surfaces depending on whether they contain Zr or Pd. For Zr-substituted surfaces, the U value affects the reduction of surface Ce atoms, leading to a strong dependence on U. However, for Pd-substituted surfaces, the U value impacts the reduction of surface Pd atoms instead, resulting in a lesser influence on energetics.

5. After oxygen vacancy formation, the surfaces undergo reduction of surface and subsurface Ce4+ ions. This is confirmed by Bader charge analysis and projected density of states (PDOS), indicating that the vacancy formation process leads to a reduction of the surface metal atoms.

1. 马斯-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过需要形成氧空位作为关键步骤来运行。这个过程释放出电子，这些电子随后转移到反应物上，增强其活性。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。具有较低ΔEv值的表面更容易还原，因此在催化作用中更为活跃。

2. 甲烷在表面的吸附热力学与氧空位形成的能态相关。这意味着氧空位形成越放热，甲烷以解离形式吸附的可能性就越大，释放氢原子和一个甲基自由基。

3. 在铈氧化物表面上掺入钯会导致表面更易于还原，即使钯原子本身并未直接与吸附物种结合，也导致吸附能显著增加。这表明钯掺杂增强了表面的整体还原性。

4. 在使用DFT+U方法时，Hubbard U参数的选择对铈氧化物表面的氧空位形成能和甲烷吸附能的影响因是否含有锆或钯而异。对于锆掺杂的表面，U值会影响表面铈原子的还原，导致对U的强依赖性。然而，对于钯掺杂的表面，U值影响的是表面钯原子的还原，从而导致对能量影响的较小影响。

5. 在形成氧空位后，表面经历了表面和亚表面铈4+离子的还原。这一过程通过鲍德电荷分析和投影密度泛函（PDOS）得到证实，表明空位形成过程导致表面金属原子的还原。
