The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies higher surface reducibility, facilitating more efficient oxygen migration and adsorption, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface. The presence of metals like Zr or Pd in the ceria lattice can reduce ΔEv, thereby lowering the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption, contributing to improved catalytic performance.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧化空位的形成和迁移来运作。氧化空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更高的表面还原性，促进氧的更有效迁移和吸附，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在铈化物晶格中加入金属如Zr或Pd可以降低ΔEv，进而降低氧空位形成和甲烷吸附的能量壁垒，有助于提高催化性能。
