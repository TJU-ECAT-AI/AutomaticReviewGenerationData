[1] "The incorporation of metals such as Zr or Pd into the ceria lattice at the surface lowers the energy of oxygen vacancy formation, as well as the reaction energy and barrier for methane adsorption."
[2] "For the oxidation of CH4 to CO2, microreactor experiments performed by Bozo et. al suggest that Zr doping may increase the thermal stability of ceria by preventing deactivation at high temperatures."
[3] "For the (111) surface, Pd substitution results in contraction of the lattice around the Pd center to form PdO coordination lengths 0.10.2 Å shorter than CeO lengths in the first three surface layers."
[4] "The energetics of oxygen vacancy formation and methane adsorption over pure and Zr or Pd substituted ceria surfaces were determined using the DFT+U method."
[5] "The addition of Zr to CeO2 alters structural and electronic properties of relevance for heterogeneous catalysis, however the impact of Zr addition on surface reducibility and activity is unclear."
[6] "The lowest energy pathway for dissociative adsorption on the (111) surface proceeds through H abstraction and the formation of a methyl radical, and subsequent chemisorption of the radical species."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen from the oxide surface to the substrate molecule, typically a hydrocarbon. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more easily reducible, meaning it can accept electrons more readily. This increased reductivity enhances the surface's ability to facilitate electron and oxygen transfer, thereby boosting its catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Consequently, the ΔEv serves as an indicator of the surface's efficiency in promoting oxidation reactions, with lower values correlating to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面和基质分子（通常是烃类）之间的电子和氧转移来发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。较低的ΔEv意味着表面更容易被还原，即它能更易于接受电子。这种增强的还原性提高了表面促进氧化反应的能力，从而提升了其催化活性和氧化力。因此，ΔEv作为衡量表面促进氧化反应效率的指标，较低的值与更高的催化活性和氧化能力相关联。
