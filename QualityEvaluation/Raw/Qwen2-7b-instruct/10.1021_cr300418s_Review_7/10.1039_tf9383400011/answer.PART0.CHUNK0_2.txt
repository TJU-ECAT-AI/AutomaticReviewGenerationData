1. The literature focuses on reactions involving three centers, such as A, B, and C, which can be atoms, ions, or groups.
2. The classical example for applying the semi-empirical method of calculating activation energies is reaction (I).
3. The energy changes in reactions can be divided into repulsion forces between A and BC, among other considerations.
4. Complications arise if the perturbation energy (E,) is very small compared to kT.
5. The energy surfaces E, and E, correspond to two electronic states covering the same values of the coordinates A-B and B-C in the linear arrangement of the centers ABC.
6. By starting the reaction with A at a great distance, the action of repulsions can be practically excluded.
7. The transition state configuration is excessively compressed, indicating a significant deviation from equilibrium.
8. There is a simple parallelism between reactivity and reaction heat when varying a lateral center A or C.
9. Relationships akin to equation (9) can be expressed using the transition state method.

1. 文献关注于涉及三个中心（如A、B和C，可以是原子、离子或团簇）的反应。
2. 应用半经验方法计算活化能的经典例子是反应（I）。
3. 反应的能量变化可以分为A与BC之间的排斥力等考虑。
4. 如果扰动能量（E,）远小于kT，则会出现复杂情况。
5. 能量表面E,和E,对应两个电子状态，覆盖A-B和B-C在直线排列中的相同坐标值。
6. 通过将A从远处开始反应，可以几乎完全排除排斥作用的影响。
7. 过渡态构型被过度压缩，表明显著偏离平衡状态。
8. 当改变侧中心A或C时，活性和反应热之间存在简单的平行关系。
9. 类似于方程（9）的关系可以通过过渡态方法表达。
