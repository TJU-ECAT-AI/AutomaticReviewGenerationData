[1] "The activation energy is reduced by the fact that owing to the proximity of the lateral centres A and C the attraction curves of BC and AB cross each other."
[2] "The repulsion between A and BC as well as the repulsion between AB and C cause an increase in the activation energy. This constitutes a second source of inertia, which, in contrast to the first form of inertia arising from bond strength, operates equally in both directions of the reaction."
[3] "The repulsion between atoms and ions has been estimated by various assumptions linking the problem up with empirical data."
[4] "It thus appears that as a heuristic principle it is justifiable to make some assumption about the repulsive forces common to a group of reactions and thereby to explain the regularities within that group."
[5] "We might expect the transition state to be given on the lines of Fig. 10 by the intersection of the attrac- tion curve RCl with the repulsion curve arising between the ions."

1. The activation energy is decreased when the lateral centers A and C are close to each other because the attraction curves of BC and AB intersect. This happens due to the proximity of these centers.

2. The repulsion between A and BC, as well as between AB and C, leads to an increase in the activation energy. This is a second source of inertia, functioning equally in both directions of the reaction compared to the inertia caused by bond strength.

3. The repulsive forces between atoms and ions have been calculated using various assumptions connecting the problem with empirical data.

4. Assuming common repulsive forces among a group of reactions allows for explaining the regularities within that group, serving as a heuristic principle.

5. We anticipate that the transition state can be determined by the intersection of the attraction curve RCl with the repulsion curve occurring between the ions.

1. 当侧中心A和C接近时，由于BC和AB曲线相交，激活能减少。这是由于这些中心的临近导致的。

2. A与BC之间的排斥力以及AB与C之间的排斥力导致激活能增加。这是惰性的一种第二来源，在反应的两个方向上与由键强度产生的惰性同样运作。

3. 原子与离子之间的排斥力通过将问题与经验数据连接起来的各种假设进行计算。

4. 假设一组反应中的共同排斥力允许解释该组内的规律，作为一个启发式原则。

5. 我们预期通过离子之间的排斥曲线与RCl吸引力曲线的交点可以确定过渡状态。
