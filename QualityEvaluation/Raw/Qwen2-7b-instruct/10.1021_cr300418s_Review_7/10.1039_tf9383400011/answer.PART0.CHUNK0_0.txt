[1] "In a reaction A + BC = AB + C we can arrive at identical configurations of the particles either (a) by compressing A against the molecule BC (which may be extended or compressed, but always remains a molecule) or (b) by pressing C against the molecule AB (AB remaining a molecule)."
[2] "The energy of the system for any configuration in general has two possible values corresponding to the states I and II."
[3] "These can be represented in a simple fashion for such configurations for which El and E2 have identical values E; the two energy values of the system will then be E = E1 + E2/2."
[4] "The transition state of the reaction has the configuration for which E, has its minimum value, Em ; the activation energy is Em - El,."
[5] "If El, is small, the activation energy becomes equal to Em."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through two primary pathways: compressing A against BC or pressing C against AB. For any configuration, the system typically has two energy values associated with states I and II. When El and E2 are equal, the system's energy can be represented as a midpoint between E1 and E2. The transition state of the reaction is characterized by Em, which is the minimum value of E, and the activation energy is calculated as Em minus El. When El, is small, the activation energy essentially equals Em.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过两种主要途径运作：将A压缩到BC上或将C压在AB上。对于任何配置，系统通常具有与状态I和II相关联的两个能量值。当El和E2相等时，系统的能量可以表示为介于E1和E2之间的中点。反应的过渡态由Em定义，这是E的最小值，激活能计算为Em减去El。当El较小时，激活能等于Em。
