[1] "In a reaction A + BC = AB + C we can arrive at identical configurations of the particles either (a) by compressing A against the molecule BC (which may be extended or compressed, but always remains a molecule) or (b) by pressing C against the molecule AB (AB remaining a molecule)."
[2] "In the first case the potential energy of the system is given, according to Slater by, Qbc + J ac  + Qab + Quc - i ( J ab  + J uc ) - (1)"
[3] "We call #1 the state corresponding to this energy surface ; then : El = J*lHldT where H is the energy operator."
[4] "Similarly for the second case (b) we can define the state t2 when where E2 will define another energy surface made up of a continuous series of repulsion curves for different internuclear separations AB."
[5] "Between the two states $ ,and #2 there will be resonance leading to two continuous energy surfaces."
[6] "When A + BC and AB + C have the same configuration and the same energy, the two original energy surfaces will interesect. On this line of intersection there will be one point of lowest energy."
[7] "The configuration corresponding to the lowest point of this intersecting line is a very close approximation to the transition state of the reaction and its energy is found by taking into account the perturbation energy as follows."
[8] "The transition state of the reaction has the configuration for which E, has its minimum value, Em ; the activation energy is Em - El,."
[9] "For other cases we might use other methods for calculating the B and R terms and the perturbation energy El,."
[10] "The perturbation energy is the smaller, the more extensive is the reorganisation of the electronic structure involved in the reaction."
[11] "E,, might, therefore, be expected to be small for such electron-switch reactions as listed under 2-5, whereas it has a decisive influence in homo- polar reactions of the type (I)."
[12] "We will set aside this difficulty by considering here only such collisions which actually lead to reaction."
[13] "At low temperatures, to which we restrict ourselves, the transition from the syrface El to the surface E , will always occur at the configuration corresponding to Em."
[14] "If El, is small, the activation energy becomes equal to Em."
[15] "The energy surfaces E, and E, form two surfaces (to which we can now refer as corresponding to two electronic states) which cover the same values of the co-ordinates which are the distances A-B and B-C in the linear arrangement of the centres1 ABC."
[16] "To show the shape of this curve a. diagonal section of IThis method is a variation of the semi-empirical method of Eyring and Polanyi. Its present form is due to R. Ogg and M. Polanyi, Trans. Faraday Soc., 1935,31,607, who used the method for the determination of the mechanism of reactions of types 2 and 5."
[17] "The same principles hold with respect to the E , It follows that the energy surfaces E, and E, can be constructed from a knowledge of four curves; the potential curves of the molecules BC and AB and the repulsion curve for the systems A + BC and AB + C."
[18] "We will say that a reaction has "inertia" if it possesses activation energy in the exothermic direction and, consequently its activation energy in the opposite direction exceeds its endothermicity."
[19] "Chemical driving force will be said to be present when the formation of a bond which occurs in the reaction causes a lowering of the activation energy."
[20] "We will analyse inertia and driving force by discussing possible reaction paths on the basis of the energy surfaces shown in Fig. I and repeated in Fig. 5."
[21] "We may first exclude practically altogether the action of repulsions by starting the reaction with A at a great distance."
[22] "Following then N-P we extend the bond BC up to the transition' state P where the molecule AB is formed."
[23] "Subsequently the molecule AB contracts along P-R and finally C is removed along R-S to infinity."
[24] "The process amounts ob- to a complete dis- sociation of BC followed by the formation of AB @ (4, (b), (4, (4."
[25] "The energy changes a r e shown in Fig. 8 i."
[26] "The energy changes along this We show them once more in Taking into account the dotted lm ---- p ic"
[27] "Along this reaction path no use is made of the driving force of the reaction : The activation energy is equal to the dissociation energy of BC and would retain this high value whatever amount of energy were subsequently released in the formation of the AB bond."
[28] "If we wish to bring the driving force into action we have to carry out the transfer of the atom B from its linkage with C to its new association with A while A and C are closer together as, for example, indicated by"
[29] "The energy changes along this We show them once more in Taking into account the dotted lm ---- p ic"
[30] "We notice in particular that both curves have moved upwards :the BC curve moved by the amount of the energy required to approach A to the position (with respect to the BC molecule) which corresponds to the transition state; the AB curve moved by the amount of energy released when C is repelled to infinity after the transfer of B has been completed."
[31] "The upward shifts of the two attraction curves naturally raises the energy-height of their crossing point."
[32] "The results of such excessive com- pression on the energy diagram of a reaction path is shown in Fig. 10."
[33] "The stage of compression at which the activation energy of the re- action path has its minimum value defines the transition state of the reaction."
[34] "Clearly, the transition state of configuration in the transition state is excessively compressed."
[35] "We can summarise our views on inertia and driving force for a three- centre reaction A + BC = AB + C in the case that the perturbation energy can be neglected as follows:"
[36] "(I) Inertia is primarily due to the binding force residing in BC."
[37] "(2) The repulsion between A and BC as well as the repulsion between AB and C cause an increase in the activation energy."
[38] "(3) The inertia arising from repulsion counteracts the driving force."
[39] "The nature of repulsion."
[40] "The repulsion between atoms and ions has been estimated by various assumptions linking the problem up with empirical data."
[41] "We might expect the transition state to be given on the lines of Fig. 10 by the intersection of the attrac- tion curve RCl with the repulsion curve arising between the ions."
[42] "The fact should be mentioned that repulsion might be due to de- solvationl which is important for ionic reactions in solution (see next section)."
[43] "We have already pointed out that in the absence of repulsive forces no inertia can arise."
[44] "The gas-phase reactions H+ + D, = HD + D+ C1- + NaCl = ClNa + C are examples of this kind, but they have not yet been measured."
[45] "The fact that the results obtained are similar whichever approximation is used, and that the activation energies so obtained are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values, indicate that the various methods have a common element of truth."
[46] "The significance of any uncertainty regarding the repulsive forces is further reduced by the fact that the sequence and grading of reactiv- ities in groups of similar reactions, can be accounted for merely by the grading of bond strengths while assuming an invariant repulsion curve."
[47] "It thus appears that as a heuristic principle it is justifiable to make some assumption about the repulsive forces common to a group of reactions and thereby to explain the regularities within that group."
[48] "The fact should be mentioned that repulsion might be due to de- solvationl which is important for ionic reactions in solution (see next section)."
[49] "It is interesting to consider the reaction Na + CIR = NaCl + R in the following way."
[50] "With the sodium atom at infinity the position of the molecular energy curve of RCl to that of the repulsion curve R-Cl- would be as in Fig. 12, where the distance V between the asymptotes corresponds to the energy involved in transferring an electron from Na to C1."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In this context, ΔEv signifies the energy barrier associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies in the oxide surface, which plays a crucial role in the reaction's efficiency and selectivity.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more facile oxygen vacancy formation, facilitating faster reaction rates and higher catalytic activity. Moreover, the ability of the oxide to effectively create and utilize oxygen vacancies affects its oxidizing capability, as these vacancies can act as active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent oxidation reactions.

3. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the balance between ΔEv and other factors, such as the strength of interactions between the reactants and the catalyst surface, the stability of intermediates, and the overall reaction pathway, determines the efficiency of the catalytic process. By tuning parameters such as the oxide composition, surface morphology, and operating conditions, researchers can optimize the ΔEv to enhance the catalytic performance and maximize the desired product yields in oxidation reactions.

1. 罗斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中运作，通过利用氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在此背景下，ΔEv代表氧化物表面形成氧气空位的能量壁垒，对反应的效率和选择性具有关键作用。

2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力中的重要性在于它对反应动力学和热力学的影响。较低的ΔEv通常意味着氧气空位形成更为容易，从而导致更快的反应速率和更高的催化活性。此外，氧化物有效创造和利用氧气空位的能力影响其氧化能力，因为这些空位可以作为吸附氧和后续氧化反应的活性位点。

3. 在罗斯-范克雷伦机制中，ΔEv与其他因素之间的平衡，如反应物与催化剂表面的相互作用强度、中间体的稳定性以及整体反应途径，决定了催化过程的效率。通过调整参数，如氧化物组成、表面形态和操作条件，研究人员可以优化ΔEv以提高催化性能并最大化所需产物的产率。
