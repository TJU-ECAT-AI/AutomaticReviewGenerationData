<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. In a reaction A + BC = AB + C, configurations of the particles can be achieved by either compressing A against the molecule BC or pressing C against the molecule AB.

2. If E, is much smaller than kT, the transition from the surface El to the surface E, will happen at the configuration corresponding to Em.

3. When starting a reaction, the action of repulsions can be excluded by placing A at a great distance from the system.

4. Compression of the system can initially lead to a reduction of the activation energy, but further compression will eventually increase it.

5. Repulsion in ionic reactions in solution might be due to desolvation.

6. The distance V between the asymptotes in Fig. 12 represents the energy involved in transferring an electron from Na to C1.

7. The similarity of results and agreement with experimental values across different methods suggest they share a common truth.

8. A simple parallelism exists between reactivity and reaction heat when varying lateral centers A or C, but this does not apply universally.

9. Relationships akin to equation (9) have been articulated through the transition state method recently.

1. 在反应A + BC = AB + C中，可以通过压缩A对抗分子BC或按压C对抗分子AB来获得等效配置。

2. 如果E,远小于kT，则从表面El到表面E,的过渡将在对应于Em的配置处发生。

3. 通过在系统外放置A，可以排除反应开始时的排斥作用。

4. 系统的压缩最初会导致激活能的减少，但进一步压缩将最终增加它。

5. 对于溶液中的离子反应，排斥力可能与脱溶剂化有关。

6. Fig. 12中两渐近线之间的距离V代表从Na转移电子到C1的能量。

7. 不同方法的相似结果和与实验值的合理一致性表明它们共享共同的真理。

8. 当改变横向中心A或C时，反应活性和反应热之间存在简单的平行关系，但这并不适用于所有情况。

9. 通过过渡状态方法，最近提出了类似于方程（9）的关系。
