[1] "In a reaction A + BC = AB + C we can arrive at identical configurations of the particles either (a) by compressing A against the molecule BC (which may be extended or compressed, but always remains a molecule) or (b) by pressing C against the molecule AB (AB remaining a molecule)."
[2] "The energy of the system for any configuration in general has two possible values corresponding to the states I and II."
[3] "These can be represented in a simple fashion for such configurations for which El and E2 have identical values E; the two energy values of the system will then be E = E1 + E2/2."
[4] "The transition state of the reaction has the configuration for which E, has its minimum value, Em ; the activation energy is Em - El,."
[5] "If El, is small, the activation energy becomes equal to Em."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through two primary pathways: compressing A against BC or pressing C against AB. For any configuration, the system typically has two energy values associated with states I and II. When El and E2 are equal, the system's energy can be represented as a midpoint between E1 and E2. The transition state of the reaction is characterized by Em, which is the minimum value of E, and the activation energy is calculated as Em minus El. When El, is small, the activation energy essentially equals Em.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过两种主要途径运作：将A压缩到BC上或将C压在AB上。对于任何配置，系统通常具有与状态I和II相关联的两个能量值。当El和E2相等时，系统的能量可以表示为介于E1和E2之间的中点。反应的过渡态由Em定义，这是E的最小值，激活能计算为Em减去El。当El较小时，激活能等于Em。

[1] "The activation energy is reduced by the fact that owing to the proximity of the lateral centres A and C the attraction curves of BC and AB cross each other."
[2] "The repulsion between A and BC as well as the repulsion between AB and C cause an increase in the activation energy. This constitutes a second source of inertia, which, in contrast to the first form of inertia arising from bond strength, operates equally in both directions of the reaction."
[3] "The repulsion between atoms and ions has been estimated by various assumptions linking the problem up with empirical data."
[4] "It thus appears that as a heuristic principle it is justifiable to make some assumption about the repulsive forces common to a group of reactions and thereby to explain the regularities within that group."
[5] "We might expect the transition state to be given on the lines of Fig. 10 by the intersection of the attrac- tion curve RCl with the repulsion curve arising between the ions."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The activation energy is decreased when the lateral centers A and C are close to each other because the attraction curves of BC and AB intersect. This happens due to the proximity of these centers.

2. The repulsion between A and BC, as well as between AB and C, leads to an increase in the activation energy. This is a second source of inertia, functioning equally in both directions of the reaction compared to the inertia caused by bond strength.

3. The repulsive forces between atoms and ions have been calculated using various assumptions connecting the problem with empirical data.

4. Assuming common repulsive forces among a group of reactions allows for explaining the regularities within that group, serving as a heuristic principle.

5. We anticipate that the transition state can be determined by the intersection of the attraction curve RCl with the repulsion curve occurring between the ions.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 当侧中心A和C接近时，由于BC和AB曲线相交，激活能减少。这是由于这些中心的临近导致的。

2. A与BC之间的排斥力以及AB与C之间的排斥力导致激活能增加。这是惰性的一种第二来源，在反应的两个方向上与由键强度产生的惰性同样运作。

3. 原子与离子之间的排斥力通过将问题与经验数据连接起来的各种假设进行计算。

4. 假设一组反应中的共同排斥力允许解释该组内的规律，作为一个启发式原则。

5. 我们预期通过离子之间的排斥曲线与RCl吸引力曲线的交点可以确定过渡状态。

[2] "In the first case the potential energy of the system is given, according to Slater by, Qbc + J ac  + Qab + Quc - i ( J ab  + J uc ) - (1)"
[3] "We call #1 the state corresponding to this energy surface ; then : El = J*lHldT where H is the energy operator."
[4] "Similarly for the second case (b) we can define the state t2 when where E2 will define another energy surface made up of a continuous series of repulsion curves for different internuclear separations AB."
[5] "Between the two states $ ,and #2 there will be resonance leading to two continuous energy surfaces."
[6] "When A + BC and AB + C have the same configuration and the same energy, the two original energy surfaces will interesect. On this line of intersection there will be one point of lowest energy."
[7] "The configuration corresponding to the lowest point of this intersecting line is a very close approximation to the transition state of the reaction and its energy is found by taking into account the perturbation energy as follows."
[8] "The transition state of the reaction has the configuration for which E, has its minimum value, Em ; the activation energy is Em - El,."
[9] "For other cases we might use other methods for calculating the B and R terms and the perturbation energy El,."
[10] "The perturbation energy is the smaller, the more extensive is the reorganisation of the electronic structure involved in the reaction."
[11] "E,, might, therefore, be expected to be small for such electron-switch reactions as listed under 2-5, whereas it has a decisive influence in homo- polar reactions of the type (I)."
[12] "We will set aside this difficulty by considering here only such collisions which actually lead to reaction."
[13] "At low temperatures, to which we restrict ourselves, the transition from the syrface El to the surface E , will always occur at the configuration corresponding to Em."
[14] "If El, is small, the activation energy becomes equal to Em."

[16] "To show the shape of this curve a. diagonal section of IThis method is a variation of the semi-empirical method of Eyring and Polanyi. Its present form is due to R. Ogg and M. Polanyi, Trans. Faraday Soc., 1935,31,607, who used the method for the determination of the mechanism of reactions of types 2 and 5."
[17] "The same principles hold with respect to the E , It follows that the energy surfaces E, and E, can be constructed from a knowledge of four curves; the potential curves of the molecules BC and AB and the repulsion curve for the systems A + BC and AB + C."
[18] "We will say that a reaction has "inertia" if it possesses activation energy in the exothermic direction and, consequently its activation energy in the opposite direction exceeds its endothermicity."
[19] "Chemical driving force will be said to be present when the formation of a bond which occurs in the reaction causes a lowering of the activation energy."
[20] "We will analyse inertia and driving force by discussing possible reaction paths on the basis of the energy surfaces shown in Fig. I and repeated in Fig. 5."
[21] "We may first exclude practically altogether the action of repulsions by starting the reaction with A at a great distance."

[26] "The energy changes along this We show them once more in Taking into account the dotted lm ---- p ic"
[27] "Along this reaction path no use is made of the driving force of the reaction : The activation energy is equal to the dissociation energy of BC and would retain this high value whatever amount of energy were subsequently released in the formation of the AB bond."
[28] "If we wish to bring the driving force into action we have to carry out the transfer of the atom B from its linkage with C to its new association with A while A and C are closer together as, for example, indicated by"
[29] "The energy changes along this We show them once more in Taking into account the dotted lm ---- p ic"
[30] "We notice in particular that both curves have moved upwards :the BC curve moved by the amount of the energy required to approach A to the position (with respect to the BC molecule) which corresponds to the transition state; the AB curve moved by the amount of energy released when C is repelled to infinity after the transfer of B has been completed."
[31] "The upward shifts of the two attraction curves naturally raises the energy-height of their crossing point."
[32] "The results of such excessive com- pression on the energy diagram of a reaction path is shown in Fig. 10."
[33] "The stage of compression at which the activation energy of the re- action path has its minimum value defines the transition state of the reaction."
[34] "Clearly, the transition state of configuration in the transition state is excessively compressed."
[35] "We can summarise our views on inertia and driving force for a three- centre reaction A + BC = AB + C in the case that the perturbation energy can be neglected as follows:"
[36] "(I) Inertia is primarily due to the binding force residing in BC."

[44] "The gas-phase reactions H+ + D, = HD + D+ C1- + NaCl = ClNa + C are examples of this kind, but they have not yet been measured."
[45] "The fact that the results obtained are similar whichever approximation is used, and that the activation energies so obtained are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values, indicate that the various methods have a common element of truth."
[46] "The significance of any uncertainty regarding the repulsive forces is further reduced by the fact that the sequence and grading of reactiv- ities in groups of similar reactions, can be accounted for merely by the grading of bond strengths while assuming an invariant repulsion curve."
[47] "It thus appears that as a heuristic principle it is justifiable to make some assumption about the repulsive forces common to a group of reactions and thereby to explain the regularities within that group."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In this context, ΔEv signifies the energy barrier associated with the formation of oxygen vacancies in the oxide surface, which plays a crucial role in the reaction's efficiency and selectivity.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more facile oxygen vacancy formation, facilitating faster reaction rates and higher catalytic activity. Moreover, the ability of the oxide to effectively create and utilize oxygen vacancies affects its oxidizing capability, as these vacancies can act as active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent oxidation reactions.

3. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the balance between ΔEv and other factors, such as the strength of interactions between the reactants and the catalyst surface, the stability of intermediates, and the overall reaction pathway, determines the efficiency of the catalytic process. By tuning parameters such as the oxide composition, surface morphology, and operating conditions, researchers can optimize the ΔEv to enhance the catalytic performance and maximize the desired product yields in oxidation reactions.

1. 罗斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中运作，通过利用氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在此背景下，ΔEv代表氧化物表面形成氧气空位的能量壁垒，对反应的效率和选择性具有关键作用。

2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力中的重要性在于它对反应动力学和热力学的影响。较低的ΔEv通常意味着氧气空位形成更为容易，从而导致更快的反应速率和更高的催化活性。此外，氧化物有效创造和利用氧气空位的能力影响其氧化能力，因为这些空位可以作为吸附氧和后续氧化反应的活性位点。

3. 在罗斯-范克雷伦机制中，ΔEv与其他因素之间的平衡，如反应物与催化剂表面的相互作用强度、中间体的稳定性以及整体反应途径，决定了催化过程的效率。通过调整参数，如氧化物组成、表面形态和操作条件，研究人员可以优化ΔEv以提高催化性能并最大化所需产物的产率。
