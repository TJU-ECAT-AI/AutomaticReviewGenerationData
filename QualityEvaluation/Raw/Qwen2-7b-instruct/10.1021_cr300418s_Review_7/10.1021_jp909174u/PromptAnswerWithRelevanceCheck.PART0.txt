1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of oxygen, the formation of an oxygen vacancy, and the subsequent oxidation of the reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more active surface and a higher oxidizing ability.
