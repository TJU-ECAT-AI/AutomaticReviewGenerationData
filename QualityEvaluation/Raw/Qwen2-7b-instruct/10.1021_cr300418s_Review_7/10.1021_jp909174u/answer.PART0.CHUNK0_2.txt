[1] "In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the surface of the oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic oxidation of CO."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the surface of the oxide, which is essential for catalytically oxidizing carbon monoxide (CO). The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) greatly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface.
