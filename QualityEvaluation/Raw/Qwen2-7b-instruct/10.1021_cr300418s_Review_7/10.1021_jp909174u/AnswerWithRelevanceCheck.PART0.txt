         The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of oxygen and reactants, followed by their recombination to form products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
