[1] "An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2."
[2] "The finding that formation of a oxygen vacancy defect is favored by the presence of Au atoms substituting Ti in the oxide lattice, but the charge distribution in the reduced r-AuTiO2 surface is such that its interaction with molecular O2 is weak and implies a really small degree of molecular activation."
[3] "The most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped surface. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+."

1. The presence of iron (Fe) in titanium dioxide (TiO2) is expected to enhance its oxidation activity due to the facilitation of oxygen vacancy formation. 
2. Although the presence of gold (Au) atoms substituting titanium in the oxide lattice promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, the interaction between these vacancies and molecular oxygen (O2) is weak, leading to limited molecular activation. 
3. The most promising outcome was observed in the Fe-doped TiO2 surface. Oxygen molecules were effectively activated upon adsorption, forming a superoxide species, while the iron ions were re-oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+. This indicates a potential enhancement in the catalytic activity of the oxide surface.

1. 铁（Fe）在二氧化钛（TiO2）中的存在预计会增强其氧化活性，因为促进了氧空位的形成。
2. 尽管Au原子取代钛在氧化物晶格中存在时促进了氧空位的形成，但这些空位与分子氧（O2）之间的相互作用较弱，导致分子激活程度有限。 
3. 最有前景的结果是在Fe掺杂的TiO2表面观察到的。氧气分子在吸附时被有效激活，形成了过氧化物种，而铁离子从Fe2+被重新氧化为Fe3+。这表明氧化物表面可能具有增强的催化活性。
