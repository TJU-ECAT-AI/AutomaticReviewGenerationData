[1] "An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2."
[2] "The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect Ef has been calculated as: Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) E(MTi35O72)"
[3] "In this context, the results presented in this work seem to indicate that doping of anatase TiO2 with Au is not an effective way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts, and that the active species in Au/TiO2 systems are, as is generally accepted, neutral or slightly positively charged Au atoms placed at the interface between the nanoparticle and the support, but not in the oxide lattice substituting Ti atoms."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of a reactive intermediate that involves oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. When a substrate like carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with this intermediate, it can lead to the formation of products like carbon dioxide (CO2). The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the surface's ability to activate oxygen molecules, leading to increased reactivity and catalytic efficiency.
2. The energy necessary to create an oxygen vacancy defect on the (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 can be calculated using the formula provided. This value is crucial for understanding the energetics of defect formation and its impact on the surface's catalytic properties.
3. Doping anatase TiO2 with Au is not an effective method for increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts. Instead, the active species in Au/TiO2 systems are typically neutral or slightly positively charged Au atoms located at the interface between the nanoparticle and the support, rather than in the oxide lattice substituting Ti atoms. This finding suggests that Au doping affects the surface chemistry and activity through mechanisms other than direct substitution of Ti atoms.

1. 马斯-范克里夫尔恩机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及从氧化物表面产生的活性中间体。当像一氧化碳这样的底物与该中间体反应时，它可以导致产物如二氧化碳的形成。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明氧气空位更易于形成，这可以增强表面激活氧分子的能力，从而提高反应性和催化剂效率。
2. 在等式中给出的公式，可以计算出在金红石TiO2(0 0 1)表面上生成一个氧空位缺陷所需的能量。这个值对于理解缺陷形成的能动力学及其对表面催化性质的影响至关重要。
3. 对于增加二氧化钛催化剂的氧化活性，通过掺杂金红石TiO2以Au并不是一种有效的方法。相反，在Au/TiO2系统中，通常被认为是位于纳米粒子和支撑界面处的中性或轻微正电荷的Au原子，而不是在氧化物晶格中取代Ti原子的活性物种。这一发现表明，Au掺杂通过机制影响表面化学和活性，而不仅仅是直接替换Ti原子。
