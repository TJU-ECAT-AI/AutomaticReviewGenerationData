[1] "An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2."
[2] "The finding that formation of a oxygen vacancy defect is favored by the presence of Au atoms substituting Ti in the oxide lattice, the charge distribution in the reduced r-AuTiO2 surface is such that its interaction with molecular O2 is weak and implies a really small degree of molecular activation."
[3] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2 species."
[4] "O2 adsorption on the reduced Au-doped anatase TiO2(0 0 1) surface only two different spin states have been considered, a doublet state with only one unpaired electron (N N = 1) and a quartet state with N N = 3."
[5] "Analysis of charge and spin distributions in the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces indicates that Ti4+ is reduced to Ti3+ only in the undoped material. In the presence of Au3+or Fe3+ species, these are preferentially reduced to Au+ and Fe2+, respectively."

1. For Fe-doped TiO2, an enhanced oxidation activity is anticipated due to the formation of oxygen vacancy defects being favored by the presence of Fe atoms replacing Ti in the oxide lattice.
2. The presence of Au atoms substituting Ti in the oxide lattice enhances the formation of oxygen vacancy defects, but the charge distribution on the reduced Au-doped surface weakens the interaction with molecular O2, resulting in a low degree of molecular activation.
3. In undoped TiO2, oxygen vacancy formation is energetically favorable, leading to a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, which is reoxidized from Ti3+ back to Ti4+, forming a superoxide O2 species.
4. For the Au-doped anatase TiO2(0 0 1) surface, only two spin states were considered: a doublet state with one unpaired electron and a quartet state with three unpaired electrons.
5. In the presence of Au or Fe atoms, the Ti4+ ions are reduced to Ti3+ in the undoped material, whereas in the presence of Au3+ or Fe3+ ions, they are preferentially reduced to Au+ and Fe2+, respectively.
6. The study involved analyzing the interaction of molecular O2 with oxygen vacancies in the reduced TiO2, Au-doped TiO2, and Fe-doped TiO2 surfaces by considering all possible spin states resulting from the combination of triplet O2 with the corresponding spin state of the reduced surface.

1. 对于Fe掺杂的TiO2，由于Fe原子取代Ti在氧化物晶格中促进了氧空位缺陷的形成，因此预计氧化活性增强。
2. Au原子取代Ti在氧化物晶格中的存在促进了氧空位缺陷的形成，但在Au掺杂的TiO2表面，由于电荷分布，分子O2的相互作用较弱，导致分子激活程度低。
3. 在未掺杂的TiO2中，氧空位形成能自发，导致氧化物表面向分子氧转移电荷，Ti3+被重新氧化回Ti4+，形成超氧基O2物种。
4. 对于Au掺杂的anatase TiO2(0 0 1)表面，仅考虑了两种自旋状态：一个具有一个不成对电子的双态和一个具有三个不成对电子的四重态。
5. 在Au或Fe的存在下，未掺杂材料中的Ti4+离子还原为Ti3+；而在Au3+或Fe3+离子的存在下，它们更倾向于还原为Au+和Fe2+。
6. 研究通过考虑与还原TiO2、Au掺杂TiO2和Fe掺杂TiO2表面上的氧空位相互作用的分子O2的所有可能自旋状态（源自三重态O2与相应还原表面的自旋状态的组合）进行了分析。
