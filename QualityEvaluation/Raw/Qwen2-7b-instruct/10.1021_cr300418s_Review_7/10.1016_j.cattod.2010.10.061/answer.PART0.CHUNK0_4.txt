[1] "The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect Ef has been calculated as: Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) E(MTi35O72) where E(MTi35O71) is the total energy of the reduced surface model, E(MTi35O72) is the total energy of the stoichiometric surface, and E(O2) is the total energy of a oxygen molecule in the triplet state calculated with the same computational setup used for the oxide surfaces."
[2] "The finding that doping with Au results in thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies had already been reported for the (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces of ceria [20,21], but to our knowledge it is the first time that this result is reported for titania."
[3] "The interaction of molecular O2 with the oxygen vacancies in the reduced r-TiO2, r-AuTiO2 and r-FeTiO2 surfaces has been studied considering all possible different spin states arising from combination of triplet O2 with the corresponding state of the reduced surface."
[4] "It has been found that not only the calculated adsorption energies, but also the optimized structures and charge and spin distributions significantly differ from one spin state to another."
[5] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2 species."
[6] "Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom."
[7] "The O2 species thus formed is less activated than on undoped r-TiO2, suggesting that doping of anatase with Au is not an effective way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts."
[8] "The most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped surface. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2 species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+."
[9] "Since the energy changes involved in the creation of the vacancy and in the subsequent O2 adsorption and vacancy healing are not as large as those found in undoped anatase, an enhanced oxidation activity can be expected in Fe-doped TiO2."

1. The energy necessary for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is calculated using the total energies of the reduced and stoichiometric surfaces, and the energy of a oxygen molecule in the triplet state. Its thermodynamic stability indicates the catalytic activity of the oxide surface.

2. The study reports the first occurrence of thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies in doped titania surfaces.

3. The interaction of molecular O2 with oxygen vacancies on various surfaces is influenced by multiple spin states.

4. Different spin states lead to variations in adsorption energies, structures, and charge/spin distributions.

5. O2 adsorption on undoped titania results in a highly exothermic process with charge transfer, reoxidation of Ti, and formation of a superoxide species.

6. In Au-doped TiO2, O2 adsorption is weak; the O2 is bonded to the Ti atom near the vacancy rather than the Au atom.

7. Doping with Au does not effectively enhance the oxidation activity of titania catalysts due to the less activated O2 species formed.

8. The Fe-doped surface shows promise with a superoxide O2 species formation and reoxidation of Fe, indicating enhanced oxidation activity.

9. Fe-doped TiO2 is expected to exhibit enhanced oxidation activity due to smaller energy changes during vacancy formation and O2 adsorption/healing processes.

1. 氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）通过计算还原表面模型和 stoichiometric 表面的总能量以及氧分子在三重态状态下的能量来确定。其热力学稳定性反映了氧化物表面的催化活性。

2. 研究报道了在掺杂二氧化钛表面上首次观察到热力学稳定的氧空位。

3. 分子 O2 与各种表面上的氧空位的相互作用受多种自旋状态的影响。

4. 不同的自旋状态导致吸附能、结构和电荷/自旋分布的显著差异。

5. 在未掺杂的二氧化钛上，O2 吸附是一个高度放热的过程，伴随着电荷转移、Ti 的重新氧化和形成超氧物种。

6. 在 Au 掺杂的 TiO2 中，O2 吸附较弱；O2 与靠近空位的 Ti 原子结合，而不是 Au 原子。

7. Au 掺杂的二氧化钛并没有有效地提高二氧化钛催化剂的氧化活性，因为形成的 O2 物种活性较低。

8. Fe 掺杂的 TiO2 显示出前景，形成了超氧物种，并且 Fe 的重新氧化，表明了增强的氧化活性。

9. 预期 Fe 掺杂的 TiO2 将显示出增强的氧化活性，因为形成空位和 O2 吸附/愈合过程中的能量变化较小。
