[1] "An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2."
[2] "In this sense, the enhanced activity for CO oxidation of catalysts consisting of gold nanoclusters supported on nanocrystalline ceria as compared to convention-ally prepared Au/CeO2 catalysts has been attributed to the higher concentration of Ce3+ in small CeO2 nanoparticles."
[3] "The finding that doping with Au results in thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies had already been reported for the (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces of ceria [20,21], but to our knowledge it is the first time that this result is reported for titania."
[4] "The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect in the (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 given in Table 1 is 2.70 eV."
[5] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2 species."
[6] "Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom."
[7] "The most promising result has been obtained with the Fe-doped surface. O2 adsorption involves a transfer of 0.8 e from the oxide to the molecule, that is activated as a superoxide O2 species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+."

1. The presence of Fe in TiO2 is expected to enhance the oxidation activity due to its ability to reduce the energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation.

2. The enhanced CO oxidation activity on gold nanoclusters supported on ceria is attributed to the higher concentration of Ce3+ ions, which is facilitated by the use of nanocrystalline ceria.

3. The report of thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies upon Au doping in titania is novel, contrasting with previous findings in ceria.

4. The energy required to generate an oxygen vacancy in anatase TiO2 is 2.70 eV.

5. Oxygen adsorption on undoped TiO2 leads to a strong charge transfer, causing reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a superoxide species.

6. In Au-doped TiO2, the interaction between oxygen and the surface is weak. The oxygen atoms are bonded to the Ti atom near the vacancy, which remains as Ti4+, rather than the Au atom.

7. Fe-doped TiO2 shows the most promising results for oxygen activation. Oxygen adsorption involves a significant charge transfer to the molecule, activating it as a superoxide species, while Fe2+ is reoxidized to Fe3+.

1. 铁掺杂在二氧化钛中预计会增强氧化活性，因为其能降低氧空位形成的能量。

2. 在金纳米簇负载在纳米晶铈上进行的CO氧化活性增强是由于铈3+离子浓度较高，这得益于使用纳米晶铈。

3. 二氧化钛中金掺杂导致热力学稳定氧空位的报告是新颖的，与在铈中的发现形成对比。

4. 生成一个氧空位所需的能量在锐钛矿二氧化钛中为2.70电子伏特。

5. 未掺杂的二氧化钛上的氧气吸附导致强烈的电荷转移，造成Ti3+还原为Ti4+并形成超氧化物物种。

6. 在金掺杂二氧化钛中，氧气与表面的相互作用较弱。氧气原子被连接到接近空位的Ti原子，该原子保持为Ti4+，而不是金原子。

7. 锰掺杂的二氧化钛显示出最具有前景的结果以激活氧气。氧气吸附涉及显著的电荷转移给分子，将其激活为超氧化物物种，而锰2+被氧化为锰3+。
