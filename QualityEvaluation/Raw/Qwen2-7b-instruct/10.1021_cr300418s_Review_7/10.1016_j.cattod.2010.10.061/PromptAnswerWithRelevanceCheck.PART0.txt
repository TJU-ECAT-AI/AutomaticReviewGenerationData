[1] "An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2."
[2] "The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect Ef has been calculated as: Ef = E(MTi35O71) + (1/2)E(O2) E(MTi35O72)"
[3] "In this context, the results presented in this work seem to indicate that doping of anatase TiO2 with Au is not an effective way of increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts, and that the active species in Au/TiO2 systems are, as is generally accepted, neutral or slightly positively charged Au atoms placed at the interface between the nanoparticle and the support, but not in the oxide lattice substituting Ti atoms."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of a reactive intermediate that involves oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. When a substrate like carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with this intermediate, it can lead to the formation of products like carbon dioxide (CO2). The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the surface's ability to activate oxygen molecules, leading to increased reactivity and catalytic efficiency.
2. The energy necessary to create an oxygen vacancy defect on the (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 can be calculated using the formula provided. This value is crucial for understanding the energetics of defect formation and its impact on the surface's catalytic properties.
3. Doping anatase TiO2 with Au is not an effective method for increasing the oxidation activity of titania catalysts. Instead, the active species in Au/TiO2 systems are typically neutral or slightly positively charged Au atoms located at the interface between the nanoparticle and the support, rather than in the oxide lattice substituting Ti atoms. This finding suggests that Au doping affects the surface chemistry and activity through mechanisms other than direct substitution of Ti atoms.

1. 马斯-范克里夫尔恩机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及从氧化物表面产生的活性中间体。当像一氧化碳这样的底物与该中间体反应时，它可以导致产物如二氧化碳的形成。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明氧气空位更易于形成，这可以增强表面激活氧分子的能力，从而提高反应性和催化剂效率。
2. 在等式中给出的公式，可以计算出在金红石TiO2(0 0 1)表面上生成一个氧空位缺陷所需的能量。这个值对于理解缺陷形成的能动力学及其对表面催化性质的影响至关重要。
3. 对于增加二氧化钛催化剂的氧化活性，通过掺杂金红石TiO2以Au并不是一种有效的方法。相反，在Au/TiO2系统中，通常被认为是位于纳米粒子和支撑界面处的中性或轻微正电荷的Au原子，而不是在氧化物晶格中取代Ti原子的活性物种。这一发现表明，Au掺杂通过机制影响表面化学和活性，而不仅仅是直接替换Ti原子。

[1] "An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2."
[2] "The finding that formation of a oxygen vacancy defect is favored by the presence of Au atoms substituting Ti in the oxide lattice, the charge distribution in the reduced r-AuTiO2 surface is such that its interaction with molecular O2 is weak and implies a really small degree of molecular activation."
[3] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2 species."
[4] "O2 adsorption on the reduced Au-doped anatase TiO2(0 0 1) surface only two different spin states have been considered, a doublet state with only one unpaired electron (N N = 1) and a quartet state with N N = 3."
[5] "Analysis of charge and spin distributions in the stoichiometric and reduced surfaces indicates that Ti4+ is reduced to Ti3+ only in the undoped material. In the presence of Au3+or Fe3+ species, these are preferentially reduced to Au+ and Fe2+, respectively."

1. For Fe-doped TiO2, an enhanced oxidation activity is anticipated due to the formation of oxygen vacancy defects being favored by the presence of Fe atoms replacing Ti in the oxide lattice.
2. The presence of Au atoms substituting Ti in the oxide lattice enhances the formation of oxygen vacancy defects, but the charge distribution on the reduced Au-doped surface weakens the interaction with molecular O2, resulting in a low degree of molecular activation.
3. In undoped TiO2, oxygen vacancy formation is energetically favorable, leading to a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, which is reoxidized from Ti3+ back to Ti4+, forming a superoxide O2 species.
4. For the Au-doped anatase TiO2(0 0 1) surface, only two spin states were considered: a doublet state with one unpaired electron and a quartet state with three unpaired electrons.
5. In the presence of Au or Fe atoms, the Ti4+ ions are reduced to Ti3+ in the undoped material, whereas in the presence of Au3+ or Fe3+ ions, they are preferentially reduced to Au+ and Fe2+, respectively.
6. The study involved analyzing the interaction of molecular O2 with oxygen vacancies in the reduced TiO2, Au-doped TiO2, and Fe-doped TiO2 surfaces by considering all possible spin states resulting from the combination of triplet O2 with the corresponding spin state of the reduced surface.

1. 对于Fe掺杂的TiO2，由于Fe原子取代Ti在氧化物晶格中促进了氧空位缺陷的形成，因此预计氧化活性增强。
2. Au原子取代Ti在氧化物晶格中的存在促进了氧空位缺陷的形成，但在Au掺杂的TiO2表面，由于电荷分布，分子O2的相互作用较弱，导致分子激活程度低。
3. 在未掺杂的TiO2中，氧空位形成能自发，导致氧化物表面向分子氧转移电荷，Ti3+被重新氧化回Ti4+，形成超氧基O2物种。
4. 对于Au掺杂的anatase TiO2(0 0 1)表面，仅考虑了两种自旋状态：一个具有一个不成对电子的双态和一个具有三个不成对电子的四重态。
5. 在Au或Fe的存在下，未掺杂材料中的Ti4+离子还原为Ti3+；而在Au3+或Fe3+离子的存在下，它们更倾向于还原为Au+和Fe2+。
6. 研究通过考虑与还原TiO2、Au掺杂TiO2和Fe掺杂TiO2表面上的氧空位相互作用的分子O2的所有可能自旋状态（源自三重态O2与相应还原表面的自旋状态的组合）进行了分析。

1. The presence of iron (Fe) in titanium dioxide (TiO2) is expected to enhance its oxidation activity due to the facilitation of oxygen vacancy formation. 
2. Although the presence of gold (Au) atoms substituting titanium in the oxide lattice promotes the formation of oxygen vacancies, the interaction between these vacancies and molecular oxygen (O2) is weak, leading to limited molecular activation. 
3. The most promising outcome was observed in the Fe-doped TiO2 surface. Oxygen molecules were effectively activated upon adsorption, forming a superoxide species, while the iron ions were re-oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+. This indicates a potential enhancement in the catalytic activity of the oxide surface.

[1] "An enhanced oxidation activity is expected for Fe-doped TiO2."
[2] "In this sense, the enhanced activity for CO oxidation of catalysts consisting of gold nanoclusters supported on nanocrystalline ceria as compared to convention-ally prepared Au/CeO2 catalysts has been attributed to the higher concentration of Ce3+ in small CeO2 nanoparticles."
[3] "The finding that doping with Au results in thermodynamically stable oxygen vacancies had already been reported for the (1 1 0) and (1 0 0) surfaces of ceria [20,21], but to our knowledge it is the first time that this result is reported for titania."
[4] "The energy necessary to create a oxygen vacancy defect in the (0 0 1) surface of anatase TiO2 given in Table 1 is 2.70 eV."
[5] "O2 adsorption on the undoped surface is highly exothermic and involves a charge transfer from the oxide surface to molecular oxygen, with a reoxidation of Ti3+ to Ti4+ and formation of a adsorbed superoxide O2 species."
[6] "Interaction of O2 with the vacancy defect in Au-doped TiO2 is weak, and in the most stable complex the two atoms of molecular O2 are directly bonded to the Ti atom in contact with the vacancy, that exists as Ti4+, and not with the Au atom."
