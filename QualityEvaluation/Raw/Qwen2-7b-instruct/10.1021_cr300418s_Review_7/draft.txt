1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions: Process dynamics, role of oxygen vacancies, and the critical influence of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) on catalytic activity and surface oxidizing ability.

        Detailed analysis established from the study of reference \[10.1021/ja9089846\]. Synthesized comprehension stemming from references \[10.1021/ja211396\], \[10.1016/j.colsurfa.2007.07.029\], and \[10.1021/jp2049603\]. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions utilizes the energy from oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to enhance catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. A lower ΔEv facilitates reactions by reducing activation energy. Oxygen vacancies lead to localized electronic changes affecting the catalytic surface. The quotes highlight the specific impacts of these defects on the electronic structure, emphasizing the localized nature of these effects without introducing new information.
