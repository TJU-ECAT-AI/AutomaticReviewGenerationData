[1] "Au1+ deposited onto a TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surface under soft-landing conditions at 600 K results in a surface decorated with isolated gold atoms bound to oxygen vacancies."
[2] "We show that the binding site of the Au atom depends on the degree of hydration of the surface. On a hydroxyl-free surface, the Au atoms bind to the oxygen vacancies as predicted by theory."
[3] "Heating the surface above 550 K removes the surface hydroxyls, (10, 23, 26) leaving a pristine, reduced TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surface with approximately 0.100  0.006 ML oxygen vacancies."
[4] "In sharp contrast to the image of Figure 1a, the image of Figure 1b shows no large clusters but instead shows a high density of very small spots."
[5] "Theory tells us that the Au atom bound to an oxygen vacancy on the TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surface is unstable in the presence of water. The dissociating water molecule displaces the Au atom, which then reacts with the surface and results in the AuOHTiO2 structure depicted in Figure 3b."
[6] "These images show for the first time that water molecules are not only capable of replacing an oxygen vacancy by a hydroxyl group but are also capable of forcing an Au atom out of the vacancy."

Water molecules significantly affect the adsorption site, size, and distribution of Au atoms bound to rutile TiO2(110). The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by displacing Au atoms from oxygen vacancies to the 5c-Ti rows as the surface becomes hydroxylated. This process is reversible, as demonstrated by the movement of Au atoms between oxygen vacancy and 5c-Ti binding sites upon temperature changes. The stability of the Au atom bound to an oxygen vacancy decreases in the presence of water, leading to its displacement and reaction with the surface, forming the AuOHTiO2 structure. This mechanism provides insight into the role of water in the catalytic activity of Au clusters on oxide surfaces.

水分子显著影响附着在锐钛矿TiO2(110)上的Au原子的吸附位置、大小和分布。Mars-van Krevelen机制通过使表面水化，将Au原子从氧空位移动到5c-Ti行，从而影响其吸附。这个过程是可逆的，温度变化时Au原子可以在氧空位和5c-Ti行之间移动。水的存在降低了Au原子与氧空位结合的稳定性，导致其被置换并反应于表面，形成AuOHTiO2结构。这一机制为理解氧化物表面上Au簇的催化活性提供了见解。
