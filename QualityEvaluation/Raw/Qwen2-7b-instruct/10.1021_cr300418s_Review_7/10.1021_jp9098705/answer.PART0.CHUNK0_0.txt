<p>Initial experiments using vapor deposition of Au atoms onto TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surfaces at room temperature resulted in rapid sintering and agglomeration of the Au into three-dimensional islands of the order of 100 atoms as reported by STM.</p>
<p>In these experiments, the sintered islands had approximately 30 atoms as determined from the STM image.</p>
<p>Vapor deposition of Au atoms onto this surface results in isolated Au atoms bound at the oxygen vacancies.</p>
<p>The binding site of the Au atom depends on the degree of hydration of the surface.</p>
<p>On a hydroxyl-free surface, the Au atoms bind to the oxygen vacancies as predicted by theory.</p>
<p>If the surface is allowed to interact with water at room temperature, the water molecule will displace the Au atom from the vacancy replacing it with an OH group and form a stable OHAuTiO2 complex on the TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surface.</p>
<p>The dissociating water molecule displaces the Au atom, which then reacts with the surface and results in the AuOHTiO2 structure depicted in Figure 3b.</p>
<p>These images show for the first time that water molecules are not only capable of replacing an oxygen vacancy by a hydroxyl group but are also capable of forcing an Au atom out of the vacancy.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and subsequent reaction of oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an oxygen vacancy is present on the surface, it acts as an active site for adsorption. In the presence of water, the water molecule dissociates and displaces the Au atom from the oxygen vacancy, creating an OH group. This process is reversible, allowing the Au atom to relocate back to the oxygen vacancy when the surface is heated or when the water is removed. The stability of the OHAuTiO2 complex, as depicted in Figure 3b, indicates the interplay between water and Au atoms on the surface, which is essential for understanding the role of water in the catalytic activity of Au clusters.

The displacement of the Au atom by water, as described, is a manifestation of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism highlights the dynamic nature of oxide surfaces in catalysis, where the presence of water can alter the active sites, leading to changes in the surface chemistry and, consequently, the catalytic performance. Understanding this process is crucial for developing more efficient catalysts and improving the activity and selectivity of materials in various industrial processes involving oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧空位的形成和随后的反应进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。当存在氧空位时，它作为吸附的活性位点。在水的存在下，水分子解离并置换Au原子离开氧空位，形成一个OH基团。这一过程是可逆的，允许Au原子在加热或去除水分时返回到氧空位。图3b中描绘的OHAuTiO2复合体的稳定性表明了水和Au原子在表面上的相互作用，这对于理解水中Au簇在催化活性中的作用至关重要。

水置换Au原子的过程，如所描述的，是火星-范克雷伦机制的体现。这一机制强调了氧化物表面在催化中的动态性质，其中水的存在可以改变活性位点，导致表面化学性质的变化，进而影响催化性能。理解这一过程对于开发更高效的催化剂以及改进各种涉及氧化反应工业过程的材料的活性和选择性至关重要。
