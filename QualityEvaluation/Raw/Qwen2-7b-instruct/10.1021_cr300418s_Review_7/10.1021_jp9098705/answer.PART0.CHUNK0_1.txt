The research demonstrates that water molecules influence the adsorption site, size, and distribution of Au atoms on rutile TiO2(110). Specifically, water molecules can replace an oxygen vacancy by forming a hydroxyl group and force an Au atom out of the vacancy. This process is crucial because it explains how Au atoms relocate from oxygen vacancies to 5c-Ti rows as the surface becomes hydroxylated. This understanding provides insights into the role of water in the catalytic activity of Au clusters on oxide surfaces, which is essential for designing more efficient catalysts.

Water molecules are capable of both replacing an oxygen vacancy by a hydroxyl group and forcing an Au atom out of the vacancy. This dynamic interaction between water and Au clusters on the surface is significant for understanding the catalytic activity of Au clusters in real-world catalytic systems. The presence of water molecules affects the stability and reactivity of Au clusters, which can influence the efficiency of catalytic processes.

The study also highlights the reversible nature of the Au atom relocation process, which is dependent on the hydration level of the surface. This reversibility is attributed to the competition between the Au atom and an adsorbed water molecule for an oxygen vacancy on the reduced TiO2 surface. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in Au/TiO2 catalysts and the role of water in CO oxidation.

In summary, the research provides evidence that water molecules significantly impact the adsorption of Au atoms on rutile TiO2(110), leading to changes in the binding site and distribution of Au atoms. This understanding is crucial for the development of more effective catalysts and for elucidating the role of water in catalytic processes involving Au clusters.

研究表明，水分子能够影响Au原子在rutile TiO2(110)表面的吸附位置、大小和分布。具体而言，水分子能够通过形成羟基团来取代氧空位，并将Au原子从氧空位中移出。这一过程的关键在于解释了Au原子如何在水合度增加时从氧空位移动到5c-Ti行。这种理解对于理解Au簇在氧化物表面的催化活性具有重要意义，特别是对于设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。

水分子不仅能够取代氧空位形成羟基团，还能够迫使Au原子从氧空位中移出。这种水分子与Au簇之间的动态相互作用对于理解真实世界催化系统中的Au簇活性具有重要意义。水分子的存在会影响Au簇的稳定性和反应性，进而影响催化过程的效率。

研究还强调了Au原子位置变化过程的可逆性，这取决于表面的水合程度。这种可逆性被归因于Au原子和吸附的水分子在还原TiO2表面上争夺氧空位的竞争。研究结果为理解Au/TiO2催化剂的工作机制和水在CO氧化过程中作用提供了更深的理解。

综上所述，研究提供了证据证明水分子显著影响Au原子在rutile TiO2(110)表面的吸附，导致Au原子绑定位置和分布的变化。这种理解对于发展更有效的催化剂以及阐明水在涉及Au簇的催化过程中的作用至关重要。
