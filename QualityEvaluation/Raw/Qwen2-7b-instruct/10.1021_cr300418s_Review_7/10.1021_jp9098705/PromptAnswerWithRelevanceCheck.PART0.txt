The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and subsequent reaction of oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an oxygen vacancy is present on the surface, it acts as an active site for adsorption. In the presence of water, the water molecule dissociates and displaces the Au atom from the oxygen vacancy, creating an OH group. This process is reversible, allowing the Au atom to relocate back to the oxygen vacancy when the surface is heated or when the water is removed. The stability of the OHAuTiO2 complex, as depicted in Figure 3b, indicates the interplay between water and Au atoms on the surface, which is essential for understanding the role of water in the catalytic activity of Au clusters.

The displacement of the Au atom by water, as described, is a manifestation of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. This mechanism highlights the dynamic nature of oxide surfaces in catalysis, where the presence of water can alter the active sites, leading to changes in the surface chemistry and, consequently, the catalytic performance. Understanding this process is crucial for developing more efficient catalysts and improving the activity and selectivity of materials in various industrial processes involving oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧空位的形成和随后的反应进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。当存在氧空位时，它作为吸附的活性位点。在水的存在下，水分子解离并置换Au原子离开氧空位，形成一个OH基团。这一过程是可逆的，允许Au原子在加热或去除水分时返回到氧空位。图3b中描绘的OHAuTiO2复合体的稳定性表明了水和Au原子在表面上的相互作用，这对于理解水中Au簇在催化活性中的作用至关重要。

水置换Au原子的过程，如所描述的，是火星-范克雷伦机制的体现。这一机制强调了氧化物表面在催化中的动态性质，其中水的存在可以改变活性位点，导致表面化学性质的变化，进而影响催化性能。理解这一过程对于开发更高效的催化剂以及改进各种涉及氧化反应工业过程的材料的活性和选择性至关重要。

The research demonstrates that water molecules influence the adsorption site, size, and distribution of Au atoms on rutile TiO2(110). Specifically, water molecules can replace an oxygen vacancy by forming a hydroxyl group and force an Au atom out of the vacancy. This process is crucial because it explains how Au atoms relocate from oxygen vacancies to 5c-Ti rows as the surface becomes hydroxylated. This understanding provides insights into the role of water in the catalytic activity of Au clusters on oxide surfaces, which is essential for designing more efficient catalysts.

Water molecules are capable of both replacing an oxygen vacancy by a hydroxyl group and forcing an Au atom out of the vacancy. This dynamic interaction between water and Au clusters on the surface is significant for understanding the catalytic activity of Au clusters in real-world catalytic systems. The presence of water molecules affects the stability and reactivity of Au clusters, which can influence the efficiency of catalytic processes.

The study also highlights the reversible nature of the Au atom relocation process, which is dependent on the hydration level of the surface. This reversibility is attributed to the competition between the Au atom and an adsorbed water molecule for an oxygen vacancy on the reduced TiO2 surface. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in Au/TiO2 catalysts and the role of water in CO oxidation.

In summary, the research provides evidence that water molecules significantly impact the adsorption of Au atoms on rutile TiO2(110), leading to changes in the binding site and distribution of Au atoms. This understanding is crucial for the development of more effective catalysts and for elucidating the role of water in catalytic processes involving Au clusters.

研究表明，水分子能够影响Au原子在rutile TiO2(110)表面的吸附位置、大小和分布。具体而言，水分子能够通过形成羟基团来取代氧空位，并将Au原子从氧空位中移出。这一过程的关键在于解释了Au原子如何在水合度增加时从氧空位移动到5c-Ti行。这种理解对于理解Au簇在氧化物表面的催化活性具有重要意义，特别是对于设计更高效的催化剂至关重要。

水分子不仅能够取代氧空位形成羟基团，还能够迫使Au原子从氧空位中移出。这种水分子与Au簇之间的动态相互作用对于理解真实世界催化系统中的Au簇活性具有重要意义。水分子的存在会影响Au簇的稳定性和反应性，进而影响催化过程的效率。

研究还强调了Au原子位置变化过程的可逆性，这取决于表面的水合程度。这种可逆性被归因于Au原子和吸附的水分子在还原TiO2表面上争夺氧空位的竞争。研究结果为理解Au/TiO2催化剂的工作机制和水在CO氧化过程中作用提供了更深的理解。

综上所述，研究提供了证据证明水分子显著影响Au原子在rutile TiO2(110)表面的吸附，导致Au原子绑定位置和分布的变化。这种理解对于发展更有效的催化剂以及阐明水在涉及Au簇的催化过程中的作用至关重要。

Water molecules significantly affect the adsorption site, size, and distribution of Au atoms bound to rutile TiO2(110). The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by displacing Au atoms from oxygen vacancies to the 5c-Ti rows as the surface becomes hydroxylated. This process is reversible, as demonstrated by the movement of Au atoms between oxygen vacancy and 5c-Ti binding sites upon temperature changes. The stability of the Au atom bound to an oxygen vacancy decreases in the presence of water, leading to its displacement and reaction with the surface, forming the AuOHTiO2 structure. This mechanism provides insight into the role of water in the catalytic activity of Au clusters on oxide surfaces.

Water molecules significantly affect the adsorption site, size, and distribution of Au atoms bound to rutile TiO2(110). When water dissociates and adsorbs at an oxygen vacancy occupied by an Au atom, it displaces the Au atom and forms a stable OHAuTiO2 complex on the surface. On a hydroxyl-free surface, Au atoms bind to the oxygen vacancies as predicted by theory. The Au atoms find a strong binding site on the surface before finding another Au atom. As the surface becomes hydroxylated by the residual water in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), Au atoms relocate from the oxygen vacancies to the 5c-Ti rows.
