[1] "Using density functional theory (DFT), we show that dissociative adsorption of water occurs at an oxygen vacancy occupied by an Au atom, displaces the Au atom, and forms a stable OHAuTiO2 complex on the surface."
[2] "On a hydroxyl-free surface, the Au atoms bind to the oxygen vacancies as predicted by theory."
[3] "The observation of small spots indicates that the Au atoms soft-landed onto the surface, while highly mobile, find a strong binding site before finding another Au atom."
[4] "We show using STM that the relocation of Au atoms from the oxygen vacancies to the 5c-Ti rows readily occurs as the surface becomes hydroxylated by the residual water in UHV."

Water molecules significantly affect the adsorption site, size, and distribution of Au atoms bound to rutile TiO2(110). When water dissociates and adsorbs at an oxygen vacancy occupied by an Au atom, it displaces the Au atom and forms a stable OHAuTiO2 complex on the surface. On a hydroxyl-free surface, Au atoms bind to the oxygen vacancies as predicted by theory. The Au atoms find a strong binding site on the surface before finding another Au atom. As the surface becomes hydroxylated by the residual water in ultra-high vacuum (UHV), Au atoms relocate from the oxygen vacancies to the 5c-Ti rows.

水分子显著影响附着在锐钛矿TiO2(110)上的Au原子的吸附位置、大小和分布。当水分解并吸附在一个被Au原子占据的氧空位上时，它会将Au原子置换，并在表面上形成稳定的OHAuTiO2复合物。在无羟基表面，Au原子按照理论预测与氧空位结合。Au原子在找到另一个Au原子之前，在表面找到一个强结合点。随着表面通过残留的水在超高压真空中变得羟基化，Au原子从氧空位移动到5c-Ti行。
