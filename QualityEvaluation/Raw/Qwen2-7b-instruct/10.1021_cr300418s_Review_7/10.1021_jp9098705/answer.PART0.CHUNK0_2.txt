[1] "In typical UHV conditions of 2 × 1010 Torr, water will titrate the oxygen vacancies and the surface will become completely hydroxylated within a few hours at room temperature."
[2] "Using density functional theory (DFT), we show that dissociative adsorption of water occurs at an oxygen vacancy occupied by an Au atom, displaces the Au atom, and forms a stable OHAuTiO2 complex on the surface."
[3] "Theory tells us that the Au atom bound to an oxygen vacancy on the TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surface is unstable in the presence of water. The dissociating water molecule displaces the Au atom, which then reacts with the surface and results in the AuOHTiO2 structure depicted in Figure 3b."

Water molecules significantly influence the adsorption location, size, and distribution of Au atoms attached to rutile TiO2(110) surfaces. In the presence of water, the Au atom bound to an oxygen vacancy on the TiO2(110)-(1 × 1) surface becomes unstable. The dissociating water molecule displaces the Au atom, leading to the formation of a stable OHAuTiO2 complex on the surface. This process is reversible, with the Au atom relocating from the oxygen vacancy to the 5c-Ti rows as the surface becomes hydroxylated.

水分子显著影响附着在锐钛矿TiO2(110)表面的Au原子的吸附位置、大小和分布。在水分子存在下，附着在TiO2(110)-(1 × 1)表面的氧空位上的Au原子变得不稳定。离解的水分子将Au原子移除，并在表面上形成稳定的OHAuTiO2复合物。这个过程是可逆的，随着表面被残留的水分水化，Au原子从氧空位转移到5c-Ti行。
