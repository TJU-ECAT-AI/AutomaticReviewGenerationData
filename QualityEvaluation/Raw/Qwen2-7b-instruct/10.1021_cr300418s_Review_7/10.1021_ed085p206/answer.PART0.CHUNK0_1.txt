[1] "The author uses the symbol $\hbar$ for the Planck constant and the symbol $\Omega$ for the photon frequency in both Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics."
[2] "In Chapter 9 of Quantum Mechanics, he introduces the old Planck constant $h$, the old frequency $v$, and the latter's mathematical relationship to $\Omega$."
[3] "In Chapter 21, the old constant and frequency are used in the treatment of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and Electron Spin Resonance."
[4] "The symbol $\hbar$ is then referred to as the new Planck constant and $\Omega$ the new photon frequency."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv). The energy required for this process, ΔEv, plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalyst's activity and oxidizing power.
