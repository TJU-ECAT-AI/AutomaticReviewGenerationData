[1] "All topics are covered in depth."
[2] "The two texts are somewhat integrated in that the last topic in the former, Transition State Theory, has applications to the latter."
[3] "Polyatomic molecules are not included in the discussion, a topic that many physical chemistry texts consider in detail."
[4] "Quantum Mechanics is a volume I especially like. The approach is to begin with physical observables and classical mechanics, leading to the introduction of mathematical operators and the transformations required for the wave treatment."
[5] "Symmetry is not covered, because, in the words of the author, to do it right would take too much time and, in addition, doing it briefly leads to a presentation devoid of content."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms between reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv generally leads to a more selective catalyst, as it requires more energy for the formation of oxygen vacancies, which can hinder the reaction pathway. This results in a preference for reactions that do not involve the formation of these vacancies, thus enhancing the specificity of the catalytic process.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进反应物之间的电子和氧原子转移而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）显著影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv通常会导致选择性更强的催化剂，因为形成氧空位需要更多的能量，这会阻碍反应途径。这导致对不涉及形成这些空位的反应路径的选择性增强，从而提高了催化过程的特异性。
