[1] "The interaction and mechanism for CO oxidation on a Ru-modified CeO2 surface have been investigated by using periodic density functional theory calculations corrected with the on-site Coulomb interaction via a Hubbard term (DFT + U)."
[2] "Our calculations showed that (i) the Ru dopant facilitates oxygen vacancy formation, while the Ru adatoms may suppress oxygen vacancy formation."
[3] "Incorporating Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects can instead sustain a full catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration."
[4] "The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without any activation energy leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption."
[5] "Molecular O2 adsorbs at the O vacancy forming O adspecies that then drive CO oxidation and recover the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface."
[6] "The Bader charge analysis is carried out to characterize the oxidation state of Ru as +IV ions along the catalytic cycle."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving oxygen vacancies and adsorbed oxygen species. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant as it affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation determines the ease with which the surface can facilitate the reaction. When Ru ions are incorporated into the ceria lattice, they can either facilitate oxygen vacancy formation or suppress it, depending on their location. The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without requiring any activation energy, leading to oxygen vacancy formation and CO2 desorption. Molecular oxygen adsorbing at the oxygen vacancy forms an oxygen adspecies that drives CO oxidation and recovers the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface. The Bader charge analysis characterizes the oxidation state of Ru ions along the catalytic cycle, indicating that they remain in a +IV oxidation state throughout the process.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤进行操作，涉及氧空位和吸附氧物种。氧空位形成（ΔEv）对于确定催化剂活性和氧化能力至关重要。氧空位形成的能量决定了表面促进反应的便利性。当Ru离子被引入到铈化物晶格中时，它们可以促进或抑制氧空位的形成，具体取决于它们的位置。Ru掺杂剂促进了无需任何活化能的CO氧化，导致氧空位形成和CO2脱附。分子氧在氧空位处吸附形成氧吸附物种，驱动CO氧化并恢复stoichiometric Ru掺杂的CeO2表面。Bader电荷分析沿催化循环对Ru离子的氧化状态进行了表征，表明在整个过程中它们保持在+IV氧化态。
