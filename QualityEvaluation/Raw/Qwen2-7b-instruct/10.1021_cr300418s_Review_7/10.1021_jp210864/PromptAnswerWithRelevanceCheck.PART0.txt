[1] "The key conclusions are summarized as follows: (i) the Ru dopant facilitates oxygen vacancy formation, while the Ru adatoms may suppress oxygen vacancy formation. (ii) Physisorbed CO, physisorbed CO2, and chemisorbed CO (carbonite, CO2) species are observed on the Ru-doped CeO2(111) surface, in contrast, only physisorbed CO is found on the clean CeO2(111) surface. The vibrational frequency calculations are carried to characterize these species. (iii) Incorporating Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects can instead sustain a full catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration."
[2] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, where the oxygen atom from the oxide surface is transferred to the reactant, usually a hydrocarbon, forming an oxide radical and the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates easier oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's ability to facilitate the reaction, thereby increasing catalytic activity and oxidizing power."

1. The Ru dopant enables oxygen vacancy formation, whereas Ru adatoms may hinder this process. CO, CO2, and chemisorbed CO species (carbonite) are detected on the Ru-doped CeO2(111) surface, unlike only physisorbed CO on the clean CeO2(111) surface. The vibrational frequency calculations help identify these species. Incorporating Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional defects supports a full catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration. 

2. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves oxygen atom transfer from the oxide surface to a reactant, typically a hydrocarbon, generating an oxide radical and the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, boosting the surface's reactivity and oxidizing efficiency.

1. 钌掺杂促进了氧空位的形成，而钌原子可能抑制这一过程。在钌掺杂的铈氧化物（111）表面上检测到物理吸附的CO、CO2和化学吸附的CO（碳化物）物种，而在纯净的铈氧化物（111）表面上仅检测到物理吸附的CO。振动频率计算用于识别这些物种。将钌离子引入铈氧化物晶格作为取代点缺陷支持CO氧化和催化剂再生的完整催化循环。

2. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷文机制涉及氧化物表面的氧原子转移到反应物，通常是烃类化合物，形成氧化物自由基和氧化产物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要影响。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这增强了表面促进反应的能力，从而提高催化活性和氧化效率。

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of an intermediate, typically involving oxygen vacancy formation, which acts as a site for the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the ease with which the intermediate can form, thus influencing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of the intermediate, potentially increasing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

2. The Ru dopant facilitates oxygen vacancy formation on the CeO2(111) surface, whereas Ru adatoms may inhibit this process. This results in the presence of additional CO, CO2, and chemisorbed CO species (carbonite) on the Ru-doped surface compared to the clean CeO2(111) surface. The ability to adsorb and react with multiple forms of CO enhances the surface's catalytic capabilities.

3. The incorporation of Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects enables a complete catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration. The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without requiring activation energy, leading to oxygen vacancy formation and CO2 desorption. Oxygen molecules adsorbing at the oxygen vacancy generate oxygen adspecies that facilitate CO oxidation and restore the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface, maintaining the catalytic cycle.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过氧空位的形成来操作氧化反应的中间体。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了中间体形成的难易程度，从而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv较低表示中间体更易于形成，可能增加表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

2. 铑掺杂促进铈氧化物（111）表面的氧空位形成，而铑原子可能抑制这一过程。这导致在掺杂表面存在额外的CO、CO2和化学吸附的CO（碳化物）物种，相比之下，纯净的铈氧化物（111）表面仅存在物理吸附的CO。多种形式的CO的吸附和反应增强了表面的催化性能。

3. 将铑离子引入铈氧化物晶格作为点缺陷的替代位置，可以实现CO氧化和催化剂再生的完整催化循环。铑掺杂促进CO氧化，无需激活能，导致氧空位形成和CO2脱附。吸附在氧空位上的氧分子生成氧物种，促进CO氧化并恢复铑掺杂的铈氧化物表面，维持催化循环。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving oxygen vacancies and adsorbed oxygen species. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant as it affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation determines the ease with which the surface can facilitate the reaction. When Ru ions are incorporated into the ceria lattice, they can either facilitate oxygen vacancy formation or suppress it, depending on their location. The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without requiring any activation energy, leading to oxygen vacancy formation and CO2 desorption. Molecular oxygen adsorbing at the oxygen vacancy forms an oxygen adspecies that drives CO oxidation and recovers the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface. The Bader charge analysis characterizes the oxidation state of Ru ions along the catalytic cycle, indicating that they remain in a +IV oxidation state throughout the process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy, the adsorption of an oxygen molecule onto this vacancy, and subsequent reactions leading to the oxidation of the substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's reactivity and ability to facilitate oxidation reactions. This is because the formation of oxygen vacancies creates additional sites for reactants to adsorb and undergo oxidation, thereby increasing the overall catalytic efficiency.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. When an oxygen vacancy forms, it provides an active site for the adsorption of reactants. The energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation determines the rate at which the reaction proceeds. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancy formation occurs more readily, leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This mechanism enables the oxide catalyst to efficiently convert reactants into products by facilitating the adsorption and oxidation processes at the surface.
