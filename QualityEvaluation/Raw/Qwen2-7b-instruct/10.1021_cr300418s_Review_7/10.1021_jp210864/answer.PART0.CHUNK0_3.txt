[1] "The interaction and mechanism for CO oxidation on a Ru-modified CeO2 surface have been investigated by using periodic density functional theory calculations corrected with the on-site Coulomb interaction via a Hubbard term (DFT + U)."
[2] "Our calculations showed that (i) the Ru dopant facilitates oxygen vacancy formation, while the Ru adatoms may suppress oxygen vacancy formation."
[3] "Incorporating Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects can instead sustain a full catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration."
[4] "The Ru dopant promotes CO oxidation without any activation energy leading to O vacancy formation and CO2 desorption."
[5] "Molecular O2 adsorbs at the O vacancy forming O adspecies that then drive CO oxidation and recover the stoichiometric Ru-doped CeO2 surface."
[6] "The Bader charge analysis is carried out to characterize the oxidation state of Ru as +IV ions along the catalytic cycle."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy, the adsorption of an oxygen molecule onto this vacancy, and subsequent reactions leading to the oxidation of the substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's reactivity and ability to facilitate oxidation reactions. This is because the formation of oxygen vacancies creates additional sites for reactants to adsorb and undergo oxidation, thereby increasing the overall catalytic efficiency.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作，包括形成氧空位、分子氧吸附到这个空位上，以及随后引发基质氧化。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更低的ΔEv表明氧空位形成更加容易，这增强了表面的反应性并提高了其促进氧化反应的能力。这是因为氧空位的形成提供了额外的吸附位点，使反应物能够发生氧化反应，从而提高整体催化效率。
