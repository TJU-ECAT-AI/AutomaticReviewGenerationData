(i) "The Ru dopant facilitates oxygen vacancy formation, while the Ru adatoms may suppress oxygen vacancy formation."
(ii) "Physisorbed CO, physisorbed CO2, and chemisorbed CO (carbonite, CO2) species are observed on the Ru-doped CeO2(111) surface, in contrast, only physisorbed CO is found on the clean CeO2(111) surface."
(iii) "Incorporating Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects can instead sustain a full catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. When an oxygen vacancy forms, it provides an active site for the adsorption of reactants. The energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation determines the rate at which the reaction proceeds. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancy formation occurs more readily, leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This mechanism enables the oxide catalyst to efficiently convert reactants into products by facilitating the adsorption and oxidation processes at the surface.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧气空位形成所需的能量来驱动反应。当形成一个氧空位时，它为反应物吸附提供了一个活性位点。氧气空位形成的能量壁垒决定了反应进行的速度。较低的ΔEv表明氧气空位更容易形成，导致氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力更高。这一机制使氧化物催化剂能够高效地将反应物转化为产物，通过促进表面的吸附和氧化过程。
