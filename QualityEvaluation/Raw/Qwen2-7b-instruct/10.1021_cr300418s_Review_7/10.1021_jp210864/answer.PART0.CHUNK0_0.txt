[1] "The key conclusions are summarized as follows: (i) the Ru dopant facilitates oxygen vacancy formation, while the Ru adatoms may suppress oxygen vacancy formation. (ii) Physisorbed CO, physisorbed CO2, and chemisorbed CO (carbonite, CO2) species are observed on the Ru-doped CeO2(111) surface, in contrast, only physisorbed CO is found on the clean CeO2(111) surface. The vibrational frequency calculations are carried to characterize these species. (iii) Incorporating Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional point defects can instead sustain a full catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration."
[2] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, where the oxygen atom from the oxide surface is transferred to the reactant, usually a hydrocarbon, forming an oxide radical and the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates easier oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's ability to facilitate the reaction, thereby increasing catalytic activity and oxidizing power."

1. The Ru dopant enables oxygen vacancy formation, whereas Ru adatoms may hinder this process. CO, CO2, and chemisorbed CO species (carbonite) are detected on the Ru-doped CeO2(111) surface, unlike only physisorbed CO on the clean CeO2(111) surface. The vibrational frequency calculations help identify these species. Incorporating Ru ions into the ceria lattice as substitutional defects supports a full catalytic cycle for CO oxidation and catalyst regeneration. 

2. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves oxygen atom transfer from the oxide surface to a reactant, typically a hydrocarbon, generating an oxide radical and the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, boosting the surface's reactivity and oxidizing efficiency.

1. 钌掺杂促进了氧空位的形成，而钌原子可能抑制这一过程。在钌掺杂的铈氧化物（111）表面上检测到物理吸附的CO、CO2和化学吸附的CO（碳化物）物种，而在纯净的铈氧化物（111）表面上仅检测到物理吸附的CO。振动频率计算用于识别这些物种。将钌离子引入铈氧化物晶格作为取代点缺陷支持CO氧化和催化剂再生的完整催化循环。

2. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷文机制涉及氧化物表面的氧原子转移到反应物，通常是烃类化合物，形成氧化物自由基和氧化产物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要影响。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这增强了表面促进反应的能力，从而提高催化活性和氧化效率。
