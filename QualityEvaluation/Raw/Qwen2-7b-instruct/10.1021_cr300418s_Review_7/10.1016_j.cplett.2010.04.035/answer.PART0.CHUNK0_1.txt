[1] "The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation [57], while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx [8], and the ultimate reduction to N2."
[2] "We present a first principles study of the Ta and Nb doped CeO2 (1 1 0) surface. Work from Ramirez-Cabrera et al. [16] indicates formation of Ce3+ upon doping of CeO2 with Nb and therefore for Nb/Ta-doped CeO2, we expect that one Ce3+ ion will be formed."
[3] "The presence of the Ce3+ ions is key to activating NO2, by charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond and is the first step in dissociation to NO and oxygen."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and a stronger oxidizing ability.
2. Upon doping CeO2 with Nb or Ta, a Ce3+ ion is formed due to the extra electron from the dopant residing on a single Ce site. This formation enhances the catalytic activity of the oxide surface for the reduction of NO2. The Ce3+ ion acts as an active site for NO2 adsorption and initiates the reduction process through charge transfer, weakening the NO bond and leading to the dissociation of NO2 into NO and oxygen.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧向反应分子的转移而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。
2. 在CeO2中掺杂Nb或Ta后，由于掺杂离子提供的额外电子驻留在单个Ce位置上，会形成Ce3+离子。这种形成增强了氧化物表面对NO2还原的催化活性。Ce3+离子作为NO2吸附的活性位点，并通过电荷转移启动还原过程，弱化NO键，导致NO2分解为NO和氧气。
