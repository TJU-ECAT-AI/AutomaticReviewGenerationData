[1] "The formation of Ce3+ ions in CeO2 is key for its applications."
[2] "The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation, while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx."
[3] "Doping of TiO2 with Ta and Nb produces a single reduced Ti3+ cation."
[4] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."
[5] "The choice of U in the present Letter is sufficient to describe localised Ce3+ and is used throughout."
[6] "At these doped surfaces, the presence of the Ce3+ ions is key to activating NO2, by charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond and is the first step in dissociation to NO and oxygen."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to organic molecules, leading to their oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher reactivity, as it allows for easier creation of oxygen vacancies, which are key sites for oxygen atom transfer and thus for the oxidative process.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its influence on the stability and availability of oxygen vacancies. Lower ΔEv values suggest that oxygen vacancies can be more easily formed, enhancing the surface's ability to participate in oxidation reactions efficiently. This leads to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing capability, as the surface can readily supply oxygen atoms for the reaction.

[1] "The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation [57], while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx [8], and the ultimate reduction to N2."
[2] "We present a first principles study of the Ta and Nb doped CeO2 (1 1 0) surface. Work from Ramirez-Cabrera et al. [16] indicates formation of Ce3+ upon doping of CeO2 with Nb and therefore for Nb/Ta-doped CeO2, we expect that one Ce3+ ion will be formed."
[3] "The presence of the Ce3+ ions is key to activating NO2, by charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond and is the first step in dissociation to NO and oxygen."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and a stronger oxidizing ability.
2. Upon doping CeO2 with Nb or Ta, a Ce3+ ion is formed due to the extra electron from the dopant residing on a single Ce site. This formation enhances the catalytic activity of the oxide surface for the reduction of NO2. The Ce3+ ion acts as an active site for NO2 adsorption and initiates the reduction process through charge transfer, weakening the NO bond and leading to the dissociation of NO2 into NO and oxygen.

2. 在CeO2中掺杂Nb或Ta后，由于掺杂离子提供的额外电子驻留在单个Ce位置上，会形成Ce3+离子。这种形成增强了氧化物表面对NO2还原的催化活性。Ce3+离子作为NO2吸附的活性位点，并通过电荷转移启动还原过程，弱化NO键，导致NO2分解为NO和氧气。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to facilitate the oxidation of another molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, as it facilitates easier oxygen release and thus more efficient substrate oxidation. The DFT + U approach, with a U value of 5 eV, consistently describes the formation of Ce3+ ions in doped ceria surfaces, suggesting a controlled method to introduce Ce3+ active sites for molecular reduction. At these doped surfaces, the presence of Ce3+ ions is essential for activating NO2, enabling charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond, marking the initial step in dissociation to NO and oxygen.
