[1] "The formation of Ce3+ ions in CeO2 is key for its applications."
[2] "The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation, while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx."
[3] "Doping of TiO2 with Ta and Nb produces a single reduced Ti3+ cation."
[4] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."
[5] "The choice of U in the present Letter is sufficient to describe localised Ce3+ and is used throughout."
[6] "At these doped surfaces, the presence of the Ce3+ ions is key to activating NO2, by charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond and is the first step in dissociation to NO and oxygen."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to organic molecules, leading to their oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher reactivity, as it allows for easier creation of oxygen vacancies, which are key sites for oxygen atom transfer and thus for the oxidative process.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its influence on the stability and availability of oxygen vacancies. Lower ΔEv values suggest that oxygen vacancies can be more easily formed, enhancing the surface's ability to participate in oxidation reactions efficiently. This leads to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing capability, as the surface can readily supply oxygen atoms for the reaction.

1. 桑-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面向有机分子转移氧原子，实现其氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值通常意味着更高的反应性，因为它允许更轻松地形成氧空位，从而成为氧气原子转移的关键部位，并因此是氧化过程的关键步骤。

2. 在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时，ΔEv的作用在于影响氧空位的稳定性和可用性。较低的ΔEv值表明可以更轻松地形成氧空位，增强表面参与氧化反应的能力。这导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为表面能够方便地提供氧原子进行反应。
