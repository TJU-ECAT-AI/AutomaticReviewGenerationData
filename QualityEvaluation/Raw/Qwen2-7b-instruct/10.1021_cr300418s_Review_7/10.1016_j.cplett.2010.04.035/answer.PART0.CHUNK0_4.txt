[1] "The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation [57], while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx [8], and the ultimate reduction to N2."
[2] "To this end, we present a first principles study of the Ta and Nb doped CeO2 (1 1 0) surface."
[3] "Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]."
[4] "Our approach is the following: we use DFT + U (U = 5 eV [3]) and HSE06 to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ defect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed."
[5] "Thus, DFT + U and HSE06 predict formation of the Ce 4f gap state, that this state is closer to the VB for Nb doping."
[6] "We have already shown using DFT + U (U = 5 eV on Ce, as in the present Letter) [8] that NO2 adsorbs strongly at undoped ceria surfaces in which Ce3+ was formed by generating oxygen vacancies."
[7] "The final adsorption structures are shown in Fig. 3. The adsorption energies show a gain of 0.87 eV (Ta) and 0.73 eV (Nb), indicating favourable adsorption of NO2 and a reasonably strong interaction."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the oxidation of a substrate to facilitate the oxidation of another molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, as it facilitates easier oxygen release and thus more efficient substrate oxidation. The DFT + U approach, with a U value of 5 eV, consistently describes the formation of Ce3+ ions in doped ceria surfaces, suggesting a controlled method to introduce Ce3+ active sites for molecular reduction. At these doped surfaces, the presence of Ce3+ ions is essential for activating NO2, enabling charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond, marking the initial step in dissociation to NO and oxygen.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用基质氧化释放的能量来促进另一分子的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为它便于氧气释放，从而更有效地促进基质氧化。DFT + U方法，使用5 eV的U值，一致地描述了掺杂氧化铈表面上Ce3+离子的形成，表明了一种控制方法来引入Ce3+活性位点以进行分子还原。在这些掺杂表面上，Ce3+离子的存在对于激活NO2至关重要，使Ce3+与分子之间发生电荷转移，这削弱了一个NO键，标志着NO和氧气分解的第一步。
