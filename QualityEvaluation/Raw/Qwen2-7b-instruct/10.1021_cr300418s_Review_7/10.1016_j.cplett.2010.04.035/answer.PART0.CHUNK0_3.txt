[1] "The formation of Ce3+ ions in CeO2 is key for its applications."
[2] "We present density functional theory (DFT) studies of doping of the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with +5 cations, Ta and Nb, as a route to formation of Ce3+ ions."
[3] "We use DFT + U (U = 5 eV) and hybrid DFT (HSE06 functional) to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ defect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed."
[4] "For comparison, a number of publications have shown that doping of TiO2 with Ta and Nb produces a single reduced Ti3+ cation."
[5] "The choice of U in the present Letter is sufficient to describe localised Ce3+ and is used throughout."
[6] "We have already shown using DFT + U (U = 5 eV on Ce, as in the present Letter) [8] that NO2 adsorbs strongly at undoped ceria surfaces in which Ce3+ was formed by generating oxygen vacancies."
[7] "With DFT + U giving a consistent description of the formation of Ce3+ from Ta and Nb doping, we have carried out a DFT + U calculation of NO2 adsorption at the defect-free, undoped (1 1 0) surface and find no interaction between the molecule and the oxide."
[8] "On the doped surfaces, one oxygen from NO2 (denoted OS) coordinates to the surface Ce3+ ion, with CeOS distances of 2.23 Å (Ta) and 2.21 Å (Nb)."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The higher the ΔEv, the more challenging it is for the reaction to proceed, thus affecting the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷维尔机制通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv越高，反应越难进行，从而影响表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
