[1] "The formation of Ce3+ ions in CeO2 is key for its applications. We present density functional theory (DFT) studies of doping of the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with +5 cations, Ta and Nb, as a route to formation of Ce3+."
[2] "With both methods we find formation of Ce3+ ions due to the extra electron from the dopant residing on a single Ce site, confirming the DFT + U description of these systems."
[3] "Doping with Nb and Ta activates the surface to NO2 reduction  there is no interaction with the undoped surface but the Ce3+ ion in the doped surface interacts strongly with NO2."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies to facilitate the transfer of electrons from the catalyst to the reactants, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as lower ΔEv values allow for easier creation of oxygen vacancies, thereby increasing the efficiency of electron transfer and improving the reaction rate.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位来促进催化剂向反应物的电子转移，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为较低的ΔEv值使得更容易创建氧空位，从而提高电子转移效率并改善反应速率。
