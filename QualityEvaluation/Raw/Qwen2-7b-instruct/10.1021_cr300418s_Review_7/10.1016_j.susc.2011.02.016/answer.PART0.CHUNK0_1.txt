[1] "Our results show that vanadium atoms prefer to bind in the upper threefold hollow sites on the surface and have a slight tendency to pair along the [110] direction, while vanadium dimers bind to the surface oriented along the [001] direction exclusively."
[2] "Comparison of the STM results to DFT calculations has allowed us to determine an atomistic model for these structures."
[3] "V1, VO, and VO2 clusters are centered asymmetrically over the 5c-Ti rows and have varying lengths along the [001] direction where the length of V1bVObVO2. V2 clusters appear symmetrically positioned over the bridging oxygen row."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The mechanism hinges on the energetics associated with oxygen vacancy creation, which influences the reaction rates and product selectivities. The ΔEv plays a critical role in controlling the reactivity of the oxide surface, thereby affecting the efficiency of the catalytic process.
