1. Vanadium atoms tend to attach themselves to the upper threefold hollow sites on the surface and have a slight inclination to pair along the [110] direction. Vanadium dimers, on the other hand, exclusively attach to the surface aligned along the [001] direction.
2. VO clusters connect through the vanadium atom in the upper threefold hollow site and the oxygen atom attached to a neighboring fivefold coordinated Ti atom (5c-Ti).
3. The VO2 cluster connects with the vanadium atom in the upper threefold hollow site and binds both oxygen atoms to adjacent 5c-Ti atoms. Alternatively, one oxygen atom binds to the surface while the other is directed out of the plane of the surface.
4. V2 clusters are symmetrically positioned over the bridging oxygen rows.
5. By comparing the STM findings with DFT calculations, researchers were able to establish a detailed model for these structures.

1. 钒原子倾向于附着在上部三重空位位置，并且有轻微的趋势沿着[110]方向配对。而钒二聚体则完全沿[001]方向附着在表面。
2. VO簇通过位于上部三重空位的钒原子和与相邻五次协调Ti原子（5c-Ti）相连的氧原子连接。
3. VO2簇通过位于上部三重空位的钒原子连接，并将两个氧原子绑定到相邻的5c-Ti原子上。或者，一个氧原子绑定到表面，另一个指向表面平面之外。
4. V2簇在桥接氧行上呈对称排列。
5. 通过比较STM结果与DFT计算，研究人员能够为这些结构建立详细的模型。
