1. Vanadium atoms tend to attach themselves to the upper threefold hollow sites on the surface and have a slight inclination to align along the [110] direction. Vanadium dimers, on the other hand, always attach to the surface along the [001] direction.
2. VO clusters attach to the surface with the vanadium atom in the upper threefold hollow site and the oxygen atom connected to a neighboring fivefold coordinated Ti atom (5c-Ti).
3. The VO2 cluster attaches with the vanadium atom in the upper threefold hollow site and both oxygen atoms either bound to adjacent 5c-Ti atoms or with one oxygen attached to the surface and the other directed out of the plane of the surface.
4. By comparing the STM findings to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, researchers were able to establish a detailed model for the arrangement of these structures.

1. 钒原子倾向于附着在表面的上三个折点空位处，并且有轻微的趋势沿着[110]方向排列。而钒二聚体总是沿[001]方向附着到表面上。
2. VO簇通过使钒原子位于上三个折点空位处和与相邻的五配位钛原子（5c-Ti）相连的氧原子与表面结合。
3. VO2簇通过使钒原子位于上三个折点空位处，两个氧原子分别与相邻的5c-Ti原子连接或一个氧原子附着在表面上，另一个指向表面平面外。
4. 通过比较STM结果与密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，研究者能够为这些结构建立详细的模型。
