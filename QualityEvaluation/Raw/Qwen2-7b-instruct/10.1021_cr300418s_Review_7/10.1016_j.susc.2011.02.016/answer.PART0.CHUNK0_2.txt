[1] "Our results show that vanadium atoms prefer to bind in the upper threefold hollow sites on the surface and have a slight tendency to pair along the [110] direction, while vanadium dimers bind to the surface oriented along the [001] direction exclusively."
[2] "Comparison of the STM results to DFT calculations has allowed us to determine an atomistic model for these structures."
[3] "Performing STM studies on size-selected clusters has allowed us to determine that evaporative deposition of vanadium results in a mixture of monomers and dimers, while reactive evaporation and post-oxidation methods for preparing thin vanadia films likely results in a mixture of cluster compositions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values typically lead to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability because they facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, which is essential for the reaction's efficiency. This process enhances the surface's reactivity, enabling faster and more effective oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv值通常会导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为它们使氧空位的形成更加容易，这对于反应的效率至关重要。这一过程增强了表面的活性，使得氧化反应更快、更有效。
