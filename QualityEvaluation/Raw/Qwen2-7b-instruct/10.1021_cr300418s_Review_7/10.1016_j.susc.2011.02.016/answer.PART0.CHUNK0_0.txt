[1] "Our results show that vanadium atoms prefer to bind in the upper threefold hollow sites on the surface and have a slight tendency to pair along the [110] direction, while vanadium dimers bind to the surface oriented along the [001] direction exclusively."
[2] "Comparison of the STM results to DFT calculations has allowed us to determine an atomistic model for these structures. Performing STM studies on size-selected clusters has allowed us to determine that evaporative deposition of vanadium results in a mixture of monomers and dimers, while reactive evaporation and post-oxidation methods for preparing thin vanadia films likely results in a mixture of cluster compositions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the formation of Ov, enhancing the surface's ability to oxidize molecules efficiently. Conversely, a high ΔEv may hinder the formation of Ov, potentially reducing the surface's catalytic efficiency. Therefore, ΔEv directly influences the surface's reactivity and selectivity in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧空位（Ov）的形成而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）直接决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当ΔEv较低时，它促进了Ov的形成，从而增强表面高效氧化分子的能力。相反，较高的ΔEv可能阻碍Ov的形成，可能降低表面的催化效率。因此，ΔEv直接影响表面在氧化反应中的反应性和选择性。
