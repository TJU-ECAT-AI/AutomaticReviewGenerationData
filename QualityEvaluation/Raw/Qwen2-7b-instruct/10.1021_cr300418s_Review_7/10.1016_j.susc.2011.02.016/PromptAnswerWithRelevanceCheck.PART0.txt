[1] "Our results show that vanadium atoms prefer to bind in the upper threefold hollow sites on the surface and have a slight tendency to pair along the [110] direction, while vanadium dimers bind to the surface oriented along the [001] direction exclusively."
[2] "Comparison of the STM results to DFT calculations has allowed us to determine an atomistic model for these structures. Performing STM studies on size-selected clusters has allowed us to determine that evaporative deposition of vanadium results in a mixture of monomers and dimers, while reactive evaporation and post-oxidation methods for preparing thin vanadia films likely results in a mixture of cluster compositions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the formation of Ov, enhancing the surface's ability to oxidize molecules efficiently. Conversely, a high ΔEv may hinder the formation of Ov, potentially reducing the surface's catalytic efficiency. Therefore, ΔEv directly influences the surface's reactivity and selectivity in oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The mechanism hinges on the energetics associated with oxygen vacancy creation, which influences the reaction rates and product selectivities. The ΔEv plays a critical role in controlling the reactivity of the oxide surface, thereby affecting the efficiency of the catalytic process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values typically lead to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability because they facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, which is essential for the reaction's efficiency. This process enhances the surface's reactivity, enabling faster and more effective oxidation reactions.
