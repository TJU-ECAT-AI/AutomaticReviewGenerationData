[1] "This indicates that the defects are located at the surface."
[2] "Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2) were designed to measure the connection between the band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way."
[3] "It relies on the known creation of OHb by the reaction of H2O with Ob vac [4,5] and the unchanged intensity of the band-gap state when an Ob vac is converted to OHb [6]."
[4] "The data, which are shown in Fig. 1, are very clear in showing that the band-gap state scales linearly with the density of OHb species created by reacting water with the Ob vac [the values are plotted in Fig. 4(b) in Ref. [2]]."
[5] "This is all consistent with a dominating Ob vac contribution to the band-gap state."
[6] "In contrast, our STM and photoemission measurements were carried out on identical surfaces in situ."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because ΔEv influences the reactivity of the surface and the ease with which oxygen can be adsorbed and participate in the oxidation process.
