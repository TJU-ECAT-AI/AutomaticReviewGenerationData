[1] "Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2) were designed to measure the connection between the band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way."
[2] "It relies on the known creation of OHb by the reaction of H2O with Ob vac [4,5] and the unchanged intensity of the band-gap state when an Ob vac is converted to OHb [6]."
[3] "The data, which are shown in Fig. 1, are very clear in showing that the band-gap state scales linearly with the density of OHb species created by reacting water with the Ob vac."
[4] "Part of this data set shows the effect on the band-gap state of oxidizing h-TiO2, with a reduction to 15% of its original intensity."
[5] "Electron beam irradiation for 10 s and rehydroxylation restores the band-gap state and the OHb density to their original values."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on the oxide surface during the catalyzed oxidation of molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the presence of ΔEv affects how easily oxygen can be adsorbed and transferred to reactants, influencing the overall reaction rate and efficiency. When ΔEv is low, oxygen vacancies are more readily formed, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Conversely, a higher ΔEv may lead to reduced reactivity, affecting the mechanism's effectiveness in catalysis. The linear relationship between the band-gap state and the density of OHb species, which is influenced by ΔEv, provides insight into how these factors impact the surface chemistry and thus the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（Ob vac）来操作分子的催化氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。具体而言，ΔEv的影响如何容易吸附氧气并转移到反应物，影响总体反应速率和效率。当ΔEv较低时，更易于形成氧空位，增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv可能导致反应性降低，影响机制在催化中的有效性。带隙状态与OHb物种密度之间的线性关系提供了有关这些因素如何影响表面化学以及氧化物催化剂在氧化反应性能的见解，其中ΔEv的影响尤为关键。

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because ΔEv influences the reactivity of the surface and the ease with which oxygen can be adsorbed and participate in the oxidation process.

Regarding the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because ΔEv influences how easily oxygen vacancies can be created on the surface of the oxide catalyst. When ΔEv is low, it becomes easier for oxygen vacancies to form, which can enhance the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a higher ΔEv may hinder the formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially reducing the catalyst's efficiency. Therefore, understanding and controlling ΔEv is essential for optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically correlates with increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more efficient electron transfer and oxygen adsorption.

The evidence presented to support the claim of a subsur- face change produced by the electron beam is the supposed nonlinearity of the Ob vac density dependence on the electron irradiation time compared with the variation of the band gap photoemission intensity.

Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2) were designed to measure the connection between the band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates greater stability of the oxygen vacancy, leading to a more selective and efficient catalytic process. The document supports this by demonstrating that electron bombardment of rutile TiO2 surfaces does not induce significant damage in the near-surface region, as suggested by previous comments. Furthermore, measurements on hydroxylated surfaces (h-TiO2) show a clear linear relationship between the density of hydroxyl (OHb) species and the band-gap state, indicating a dominant contribution of oxygen vacancies to the band-gap state. This linear scaling suggests that the presence and density of oxygen vacancies significantly influence the electronic structure and, consequently, the catalytic properties of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（Ob vac）来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。较高的ΔEv通常表明氧空位的稳定性更高，导致更选择性和高效的催化过程。文档支持这一观点，通过证明电子轰击锐钛矿TiO2表面不会在近表面区域引起显著损伤，如之前的评论所提出的。此外，对羟基化表面（h-TiO2）的测量显示密度的羟基（OHb）物种与带隙状态之间存在清晰的线性关系，这表明氧空位对带隙状态具有主导贡献。这种线性缩放表明氧空位的存在和密度显著影响电子结构，进而影响氧化物表面的催化性质。
