Yim, Pang, and Thornton Reply: The Comment of Wendt et al. [1] on our Letter [2] primarily claims that the electron beam method that we use in our experiment to vary the density of bridging oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on rutile TiO2110 also leads to damage of the near-surface region.

The evidence presented to support the claim of a subsur- face change produced by the electron beam is the supposed nonlinearity of the Ob vac density dependence on the electron irradiation time compared with the variation of the band gap photoemission intensity.

Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2) were designed to measure the connection between the band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way.

STM images (125  125 A2) of (a) the hydroxylated TiO2110 (h-TiO2), (b) the oxidized TiO2110 (o-TiO2) surface, and (c)(e) the surface in (b) after electron bombardment (75 eV) for 2, 5, and 10 s, respectively. All STM images were collected with a tunneling current 0:2 nA and a sample bias voltage of 1.3 V at 78 K. Symbols indicate OHb (circles) and OxHy (hexagons). (f) Corresponding ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy He I spectra recorded at 300 K of h-TiO2 (red), o-TiO2 (blue), and o-TiO2 following electron bombardment for 2 s (green), 5 s (orange), and 10 s (black), all recorded under identical conditions. Only the region near the band-gap state [0:9 eV below the Fermi level (EF)] is shown in the spectra. The data points are shown as squares, and the curves are the best fit to a Gaussian and polynomial background. The spectra in (f) corresponding to each surface are colored the same as the color borders in (a)(e).

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates greater stability of the oxygen vacancy, leading to a more selective and efficient catalytic process. The document supports this by demonstrating that electron bombardment of rutile TiO2 surfaces does not induce significant damage in the near-surface region, as suggested by previous comments. Furthermore, measurements on hydroxylated surfaces (h-TiO2) show a clear linear relationship between the density of hydroxyl (OHb) species and the band-gap state, indicating a dominant contribution of oxygen vacancies to the band-gap state. This linear scaling suggests that the presence and density of oxygen vacancies significantly influence the electronic structure and, consequently, the catalytic properties of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（Ob vac）来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。较高的ΔEv通常表明氧空位的稳定性更高，导致更选择性和高效的催化过程。文档支持这一观点，通过证明电子轰击锐钛矿TiO2表面不会在近表面区域引起显著损伤，如之前的评论所提出的。此外，对羟基化表面（h-TiO2）的测量显示密度的羟基（OHb）物种与带隙状态之间存在清晰的线性关系，这表明氧空位对带隙状态具有主导贡献。这种线性缩放表明氧空位的存在和密度显著影响电子结构，进而影响氧化物表面的催化性质。
