[1] "Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2) were designed to measure the connection between the band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way."
[2] "It relies on the known creation of OHb by the reaction of H2O with Ob vac [4,5] and the unchanged intensity of the band-gap state when an Ob vac is converted to OHb [6]."
[3] "The data, which are shown in Fig. 1, are very clear in showing that the band-gap state scales linearly with the density of OHb species created by reacting water with the Ob vac."
[4] "Part of this data set shows the effect on the band-gap state of oxidizing h-TiO2, with a reduction to 15% of its original intensity."
[5] "Electron beam irradiation for 10 s and rehydroxylation restores the band-gap state and the OHb density to their original values."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on the oxide surface during the catalyzed oxidation of molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the presence of ΔEv affects how easily oxygen can be adsorbed and transferred to reactants, influencing the overall reaction rate and efficiency. When ΔEv is low, oxygen vacancies are more readily formed, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Conversely, a higher ΔEv may lead to reduced reactivity, affecting the mechanism's effectiveness in catalysis. The linear relationship between the band-gap state and the density of OHb species, which is influenced by ΔEv, provides insight into how these factors impact the surface chemistry and thus the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（Ob vac）来操作分子的催化氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。具体而言，ΔEv的影响如何容易吸附氧气并转移到反应物，影响总体反应速率和效率。当ΔEv较低时，更易于形成氧空位，增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv可能导致反应性降低，影响机制在催化中的有效性。带隙状态与OHb物种密度之间的线性关系提供了有关这些因素如何影响表面化学以及氧化物催化剂在氧化反应性能的见解，其中ΔEv的影响尤为关键。
