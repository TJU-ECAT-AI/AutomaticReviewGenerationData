Yim, Pang, and Thornton Reply: The Comment of Wendt et al. [1] on our Letter [2] primarily claims that the electron beam method that we use in our experiment to vary the density of bridging oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on rutile TiO2110 also leads to damage of the near-surface region.
On this basis, it is clear that we do not expect to induce any significant damage in the near-surface region (as opposed to the surface plane) with our electron beam.
Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2) were designed to measure the connection between the band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way. It relies on the known creation of OHb by the reaction of H2O with Ob vac [4,5] and the unchanged intensity of the band-gap state when an Ob vac is converted to OHb [6].

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ob vac). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically correlates with increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more efficient electron transfer and oxygen adsorption.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧空位（Ob vac）的形成进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）显著影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv通常与更高的催化活性和氧化能力相关联，因为这能更有效地促进电子转移和氧吸附。
