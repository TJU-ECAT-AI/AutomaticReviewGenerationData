[1] "AC (lo2-3 X lo5 Hz) measurements have been performed on Sawyer premium-quality synthetic quartz oriented along the z axis, in the temperature range between 240 and 1500 K."
[2] "The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essentially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e. to the dissociation of AI-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions."
[3] "An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of a Na ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the P-quartz-to-tridymite transition."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically result in reduced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to decreased surface oxygen availability, while lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalyst's performance in oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过表面氧化物催化剂上的氧空位（O空位）形成而运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较高的ΔEv值通常导致催化活性和氧化能力降低，由于表面氧气可用性减少，而较低的ΔEv值则促进更易形成氧空位，从而增强催化剂在氧化反应中的性能。
