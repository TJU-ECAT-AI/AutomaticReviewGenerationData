[1] "AC (lo2-3 X lo5 Hz) measurements have been performed on Sawyer premium-quality synthetic quartz oriented along the z axis, in the temperature range between 240 and 1500 K."
[2] "The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essentially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e. to the dissociation of AI-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions."
[3] "An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of a Na ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the P-quartz-to-tridymite transition."
[4] "Our AC results [5] on synthetic oriented quartz confirmed up to 800K the data in the literature and extended the explored temperature range up to 1200 K; a new lower activation energy E of 0.67 eV was found between 800 and 1200 K."
[5] "This picture leads, however, to a value of the migration energy E, of 0.02 eV, which appeared exceedingly low."
[6] "In this paper we report new results in a temperature range extended up to 1500 K; further, results on the AC conductance of irradiated samples in the range 240 K < T < 280 K are shown. The data here reported, and specifically a new high-temperature conduction regime featuring an activation energy of 0.27 eV, suggest a reinterpretation of the ionic transport mechanisms in quartz that considers the local structure of the potential of the interstitial alkali atoms trapped in the neighbourhood of an aluminium impurity [6,7]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the stability of the oxide surface, influencing the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Lower ΔEv values indicate higher stability, which can enhance the catalytic efficiency and prolong the lifetime of the catalyst. However, the exact significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability requires specific thermodynamic calculations and kinetic analysis, which are beyond the scope of the provided literature.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位（O空位）的操作运行。这些氧空位在氧化物表面上起着关键作用，决定了催化活性和氧化能力。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的稳定性，影响了反应动力学和产物选择性。较低的ΔEv值表明更高的稳定性，这可以增强催化剂的催化效率并延长催化剂的使用寿命。然而，确定催化活性和氧化能力的具体意义需要特定的热力学计算和动力学分析，这超出了提供的文献范围。
