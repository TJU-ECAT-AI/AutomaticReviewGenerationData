[1] "AC (lo2-3 X lo5 Hz) measurements have been performed on Sawyer premium-quality synthetic quartz oriented along the z axis, in the temperature range between 240 and 1500 K."
[2] "The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essentially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e., to the dissociation of AI-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions."
[3] "An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of a Na ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the P-quartz-to-tridymite transition."
[4] "The difference between the low-temperature slope, 1.3 eV, and the high-temperature slope, 0.67 eV, was interpreted by considering that at low T the conductance mechanism is governed by additional unassociated aluminium ions, and the activation energy is E = E, + E,; at high T, on the contrary, the number of dissociated aluminium ions equals the number of free alkali ions, giving E = 4Ea + E,"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to greater catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to the increased availability of active sites on the surface.
