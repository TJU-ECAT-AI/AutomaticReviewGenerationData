[1] "AC (lo2-3 X lo5 Hz) measurements have been performed on Sawyer premium-quality synthetic quartz oriented along the z axis, in the temperature range between 240 and 1500 K."
[2] "The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essentially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e., to the dissociation of AI-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions."
[3] "An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of a Na ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the P-quartz-to-tridymite transition."
[4] "The difference between the low-temperature slope, 1.3 eV, and the high-temperature slope, 0.67 eV, was interpreted by considering that at low T the conductance mechanism is governed by additional unassociated aluminium ions, and the activation energy is E = E, + E,; at high T, on the contrary, the number of dissociated aluminium ions equals the number of free alkali ions, giving E = 4Ea + E,"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to greater catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to the increased availability of active sites on the surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically result in reduced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to decreased surface oxygen availability, while lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalyst's performance in oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These oxygen vacancies create sites where reactant molecules can adsorb and undergo oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalyst's ability to promote oxidation reactions efficiently.

[4] "Our AC results [5] on synthetic oriented quartz confirmed up to 800K the data in the literature and extended the explored temperature range up to 1200 K; a new lower activation energy E of 0.67 eV was found between 800 and 1200 K."
[5] "This picture leads, however, to a value of the migration energy E, of 0.02 eV, which appeared exceedingly low."
[6] "In this paper we report new results in a temperature range extended up to 1500 K; further, results on the AC conductance of irradiated samples in the range 240 K < T < 280 K are shown. The data here reported, and specifically a new high-temperature conduction regime featuring an activation energy of 0.27 eV, suggest a reinterpretation of the ionic transport mechanisms in quartz that considers the local structure of the potential of the interstitial alkali atoms trapped in the neighbourhood of an aluminium impurity [6,7]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the stability of the oxide surface, influencing the reaction kinetics and product selectivity. Lower ΔEv values indicate higher stability, which can enhance the catalytic efficiency and prolong the lifetime of the catalyst. However, the exact significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability requires specific thermodynamic calculations and kinetic analysis, which are beyond the scope of the provided literature.
