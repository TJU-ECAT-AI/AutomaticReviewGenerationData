[1] "AC (lo2-3 X lo5 Hz) measurements have been performed on Sawyer premium-quality synthetic quartz oriented along the z axis, in the temperature range between 240 and 1500 K."
[2] "The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essentially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e. to the dissociation of AI-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions."
[3] "An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of a Na ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the P-quartz-to-tridymite transition."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These oxygen vacancies create sites where reactant molecules can adsorb and undergo oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalyst's ability to promote oxidation reactions efficiently.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。这些氧空位在表面创建了吸附反应分子并进行氧化的位置。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值使氧空位更容易形成，从而增强催化剂促进氧化反应的能力。
