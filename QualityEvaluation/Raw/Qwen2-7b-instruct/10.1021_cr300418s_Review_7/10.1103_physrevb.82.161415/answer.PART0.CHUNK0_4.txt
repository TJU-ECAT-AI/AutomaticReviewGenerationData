[1] "Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110 interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial."
[2] "First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated or molecular?"
[3] "Many experimental studies have indicated that oxygen defect sites are required for dissociation."
[4] "However, density-functional theory DFT studies predict either molecular or dissociative adsorption on the perfect defect-free surface with results being sensitive to slab thickness,coverage, and exchange-correlation xc functional."
[5] "Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono- layer ML, where 1 ML is defined as one water per fivefold coordinated Ti site."
[6] "Specifically, the seemingly simple question of whether there are HBs between the first and second interfacial water layers is under debate."
[7] "Campbell and co-workers3 interpreted work-function measurements as an indication of interlayer HBs, a view supported by recent electron-stimulated desorption ESD measurements."
[8] "However, spectroscopic measurements high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy HREELS Ref. 4 did not show any redshift in the O-H stretching region upon going from 1 ML to multilayer adsorption, an observation that was inter- preted as evidence against interlayer HBs."
[9] "Our calculations with various semilocal and hybrid xc functionals indicate that water does not disso- ciate in the coverage regime examined"
[10] "The molecules within the liquid film adsorb in at least two distinct layers: those in the first layer diffuse slowly and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites; those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and dif- fuse rapidly."

Water molecules on the TiO2(110) surface do not dissociate according to the research findings. They exist in at least two distinct layers. Molecules in the first layer move slowly and strongly bind to fivefold coordinated Ti sites. Molecules in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and move rapidly. This reveals that the dynamics of interfacial water can vary significantly on the angstrom scale. Hydrogen bonds occur between the first and second layers, and there is a molecular exchange between these layers. The presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient, indicating that the monolayer may not accurately represent the aqueous water-TiO2 interface.

根据研究结果，TiO2(110)表面的水分子不会发生解离。它们至少存在于两层中。第一层中的分子移动缓慢，强烈地与五配位的Ti原子位点结合。第二层中的分子与基底相互作用较弱，并快速移动。这表明界面水的动力学可以在angstrom尺度上显著变化。第一和第二层之间存在氢键，且这些层之间存在分子交换。第二层水分子的存在会使第一层中的分子重新定向，这表明单层可能无法准确代表水-TiO2界面。
