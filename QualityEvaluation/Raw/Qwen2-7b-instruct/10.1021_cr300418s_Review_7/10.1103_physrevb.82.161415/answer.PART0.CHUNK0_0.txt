[1] "Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110 interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial."
[2] "First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated or molecular?"
[3] "Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono- layer ML, where 1 ML is defined as one water per fivefold coordinated Ti site."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Water molecules on the rutile TiO2(110) surface do not dissociate at the coverages examined. The aqueous film forms in at least two distinct layers. Those in the first layer move slowly and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites. Those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and move rapidly. Hydrogen bonding is observed between the first and second layers, and the exchange of molecules occurs between the layers. The presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient, indicating that the monolayer is a model of limited applicability to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 interface.

水分子在rutile TiO2(110)表面不会在检查的覆盖度下发生离解。液态薄膜在至少两个不同的层中形成。第一层中的分子缓慢移动，并强烈地与五次配位的Ti位点结合。第二层中的分子与基底交互作用较弱，并快速移动。在第一和第二层之间观察到氢键，分子在两层之间交换。第二层中的水分子的存在导致第一层中的分子重新定向，表明单层模型在理解水-TiO2界面时适用性有限。
