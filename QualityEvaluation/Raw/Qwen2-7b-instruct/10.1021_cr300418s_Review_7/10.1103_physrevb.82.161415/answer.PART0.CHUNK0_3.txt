[1] "Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110 interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial."
[2] "First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated or molecular?"
[3] "Many experimental studies have indicated that oxygen defect sites are required for dissociation."
[4] "However, density-functional theory DFT studies predict either molecular or dissociative adsorption on the perfect defect-free surface with results being sensitive to slab thickness,coverage, and exchange-correlation xc functional."
[5] "Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono-layer ML, where 1 ML is defined as one water per fivefold coordinated Ti site."
[6] "Specifically, the seemingly simple question of whether there are HBs between the first and second interfacial water layers is under debate."
[7] "Campbell and co-workers3 interpreted work-function measurements as an indication of interlayer HBs, a view supported by recent electron-stimulated desorption ESD measurements."
[8] "However, spectroscopic measurements high-resolution electron-energy-loss spectroscopy HREELS Ref. 4 did not show any redshift in the O-H stretching region upon going from 1 ML to multilayer adsorption, an observation that was inter- preted as evidence against interlayer HBs."
[9] "Our calculations with various semilocal and hybrid xc functionals indicate that water does not disso- ciate in the coverage regime examined."
[10] "The molecules within the liquid film adsorb in at least two distinct layers: those in the first layer diffuse slowly and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites; those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and dif- fuse rapidly."

Water molecules on the rutile TiO2(110) surface do not dissociate according to the findings presented in the document. They exist in a layered structure, with molecules in the first layer moving slowly and bonding strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites, while those in the second layer move rapidly and interact weakly with the substrate. This structure reveals inhomogeneous dynamics of the interfacial water, which can vary on the angstrom length scale. Hydrogen bonding is observed between the first and second layers, and there is an exchange of water molecules between these layers. The presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient, indicating that the monolayer is a model of limited applicability for understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 interface.

文档中的研究结果表明，水分子在锐钛矿TiO2(110)表面不会发生解离。它们以层状结构存在，第一层中的分子缓慢移动并牢固地与五配位Ti位点结合，而第二层中的分子则与基质弱相互作用并快速移动。这种结构揭示了界面水的不均匀动力学，可在纳米尺度上变化。第一和第二层之间观察到氢键，并且存在水分子之间的交换。第二层中的水分子的存在导致第一层中的分子重新定向，这表明单层模型对于理解水-二氧化钛界面的水性质的应用范围有限。
