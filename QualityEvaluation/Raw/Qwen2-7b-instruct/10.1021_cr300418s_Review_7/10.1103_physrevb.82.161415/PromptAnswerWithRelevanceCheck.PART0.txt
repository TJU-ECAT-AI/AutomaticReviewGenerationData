[1] "Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110 interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial."
[2] "First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated or molecular?"
[3] "Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono- layer ML, where 1 ML is defined as one water per fivefold coordinated Ti site."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Water molecules on the rutile TiO2(110) surface do not dissociate at the coverages examined. The aqueous film forms in at least two distinct layers. Those in the first layer move slowly and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites. Those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and move rapidly. Hydrogen bonding is observed between the first and second layers, and the exchange of molecules occurs between the layers. The presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient, indicating that the monolayer is a model of limited applicability to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 interface.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Water does not dissociate on the rutile TiO2(110) surface at the coverages examined in the study. The aqueous film is layered, with slow moving molecules in the contact layer and fast moving molecules in a second layer, revealing strongly inhomogeneous dynamics of the interfacial water. Hydrogen bonding between the first and second layers is observed as is the exchange of water molecules. The presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient, indicating that the monolayer is a model of at best limited applicability to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 interface.

Water molecules on TiO2110 do not dissociate according to the studies presented. They adsorb in at least two distinct layers: those in the first layer are sluggish and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites, while those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and diffuse rapidly. Hydrogen bonding occurs between the first and second layers, and the presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient. The dynamics of interfacial water can vary significantly on the Angstrom length scale, with the first layer molecules exhibiting slow diffusion compared to the second layer.

根据研究结果，TiO2(110)表面的水分子不会发生解离。它们至少存在于两层中。第一层中的分子移动缓慢，强烈地与五配位的Ti原子位点结合。第二层中的分子与基底相互作用较弱，并快速移动。这表明界面水的动力学可以在angstrom尺度上显著变化。第一和第二层之间存在氢键，且这些层之间存在分子交换。第二层水分子的存在会使第一层中的分子重新定向，这表明单层可能无法准确代表水-TiO2界面。
