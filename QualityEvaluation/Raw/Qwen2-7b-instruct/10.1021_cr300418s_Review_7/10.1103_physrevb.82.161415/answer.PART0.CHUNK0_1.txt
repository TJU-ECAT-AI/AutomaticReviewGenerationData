[1] "Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110 interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial."
[2] "First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated or molecular?"
[3] "Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono-layer ML, where 1 ML is defined as one water per fivefold coordinated Ti site."
[4] "Specifically, the seemingly simple question of whether there are HBs between the first and second interfacial water layers is under debate."
[5] "These findings help to resolve a number of longstanding debates in the literature and underscore the complex nature of the struc- ture and dynamics of aqueous water films on flat hydrophillic surfaces."

Water does not dissociate on the rutile TiO2(110) surface at the coverages examined in the study. The aqueous film is layered, with slow moving molecules in the contact layer and fast moving molecules in a second layer, revealing strongly inhomogeneous dynamics of the interfacial water. Hydrogen bonding between the first and second layers is observed as is the exchange of water molecules. The presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient, indicating that the monolayer is a model of at best limited applicability to understanding the aqueous water-TiO2 interface.

在研究中检查的覆盖率上，水分子在rutile TiO2(110)表面不会发生离解。液态薄膜呈层状结构，接触层中的分子移动缓慢，第二层中的分子移动快速，显示了界面水的强非均匀动力学特性。第一和第二层之间观察到氢键以及水分子之间的交换。第二层水分子的存在导致第一层中的分子重新定向，这表明单层模型在理解水-TiO2界面的性质时可能只具有有限的应用价值。
