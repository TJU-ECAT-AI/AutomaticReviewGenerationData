[1] "Despite the enormous body of work on water-TiO2110 interfaces, a number of crucial issues remain controversial."
[2] "First, there is the long-standing debate on which adsorption state the water molecules are in at the interface: dissociated or molecular?"
[3] "Second, there is the question of the hydrogen bond HB network at the interface at coverages in excess of 1 mono- layer ML, where 1 ML is defined as one water per fivefold coordinated Ti site."
[4] "Specifically, the seemingly simple question of whether there are HBs between the first and second interfacial water layers is under debate."
[5] "Third, there is the issue of the diffusive properties of the molecules within the first two layers."
[6] "From a force-field study35 it was concluded that the molecules in the first layer were immobile."

Water molecules on TiO2110 do not dissociate according to the studies presented. They adsorb in at least two distinct layers: those in the first layer are sluggish and bond strongly to fivefold coordinated Ti sites, while those in the second layer interact weakly with the substrate and diffuse rapidly. Hydrogen bonding occurs between the first and second layers, and the presence of second layer water molecules causes those in the first layer to reorient. The dynamics of interfacial water can vary significantly on the Angstrom length scale, with the first layer molecules exhibiting slow diffusion compared to the second layer.

水分子在TiO2110上不会发生分解，它们吸附在至少两个不同的层中：第一层中的分子缓慢移动，并牢固地与五配位Ti位点相连；第二层中的分子与基质相互作用较弱且快速扩散。第一和第二层之间存在氢键，第二层中的水分子会导致第一层中的分子重新定向。界面水的动力学可以在埃尺度范围内显著变化，第一层中的分子扩散速度远慢于第二层。
