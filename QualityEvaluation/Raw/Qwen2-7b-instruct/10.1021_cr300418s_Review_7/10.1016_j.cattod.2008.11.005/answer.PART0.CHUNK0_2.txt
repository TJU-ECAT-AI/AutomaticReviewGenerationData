[1] "From this point of view it was interesting to observe, during an atomistic simulation work [8], that anion vacancies had apparently a tendency to associate on the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2, that was predicted to be the most stable one, but not in the (1 1 0) surface,second in stability."
[2] "The simulation of the effect of reduction on the ceria surface has been already undertaken by other authors; a number of these are discussed in a recently appeared review [14]."
[3] "It was found that for each one of these vacancy defects different specific sub-configurations could appear (depending on the particular position of the ions in the unit cell of the model)."
[4] "The self-consistent calculation led to equal spin directions for all the Ce3+ ions present (i.e. to a ferromagnetic- type spin configuration); in other cases some of the Ce3+ ions appeared with spin orientation opposite to the other ones,suggesting an antiferromagnetic interaction."
[5] "The adsorption energy of O2 on a single vacancy is computed to be 2.10 eV if starting from the vacancy sub-configuration of lowest energy (1Va, displayed in Fig. 2)."
[6] "Only in one case (for one of the vacancy pair sub-configurations) the adsorbed species evolved with breaking of the OO bond and full reoxidation of the surface defect to the 0V structure."
[7] "The examination of the DOS plots obtained for the species adsorbed on vacancy pairs or triads (Fig. 9) shows again the peaks above the valence band that are due to the p* orbitals of the peroxide ion, and clearly above them the 4f1 levels of the remaining Ce3+ ions."
[8] "A higher degree of electron transfer, that would be necessary for OO bond breaking, is not seen to occur here spontaneously; this is ascribed to the rather high energy of the dioxygen s* orbital that must receive additional electron density to complete the process."

1. The atomistic simulation observed that anion vacancies on the CeO2(1 1 1) surface tend to associate, but not on the (1 1 0) surface. This tendency was suggested in previous EPR studies.

2. Reduction effects on the ceria surface have been simulated by other researchers, as reviewed recently.

3. Different specific sub-configurations could appear for each vacancy defect, depending on the ion positions in the unit cell.

4. The self-consistent calculations showed that the Ce3+ ions often have equal spin directions, suggesting a ferromagnetic spin configuration.

5. The adsorption energy of O2 on a single vacancy is 2.10 eV, computed from the lowest energy sub-configuration.

6. In one case, adsorption of O2 on a vacancy pair led to the breaking of the OO bond and reoxidation of the surface defect.

7. The density of states plots reveal the p* orbitals of the peroxide ion above the valence band and the 4f1 levels of the remaining Ce3+ ions.

8. The spontaneous breaking of the OO bond during adsorption did not occur due to the high energy of the dioxygen s* orbital.

1. 在原子模拟中观察到，CeO2（1 1 1）表面的阴离子空位倾向于聚集体，但不在（1 1 0）表面上。这种倾向在先前的EPR研究中被提出。

2. 其他研究人员已经模拟了铈氧化物表面的还原效应，并且最近有一个综述讨论了这些工作。

3. 对于每个缺陷空位，不同的特定子配置可能会出现，这取决于单元格中离子的位置。

4. 自洽性计算显示，Ce3+ 离子通常具有相同的自旋方向，暗示了一种顺磁性自旋配置。

5. 计算得到单个空位上的氧吸附能为2.10 eV，是从最低能量子结构出发的。

6. 在一个案例中，氧吸附在空位对上导致OO键断裂和表面缺陷的完全氧化。

7. 密度泛函图揭示了过氧化物离子的p*轨道位于价带之上，剩余的Ce3+离子的4f1能级。

8. 在吸附过程中，OO键的自发断裂没有发生，因为氧分子s*轨道的能量很高，需要额外的电子密度来完成过程。
