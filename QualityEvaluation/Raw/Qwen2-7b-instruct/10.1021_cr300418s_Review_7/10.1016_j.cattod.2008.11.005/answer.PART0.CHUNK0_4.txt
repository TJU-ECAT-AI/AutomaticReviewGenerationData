[1] "It seems reasonable to assume that completing this reoxidation process will require having in close proximity the four Ce3+ ions that donate the electrons and the two anion vacancies that must accept the O2 ions."
[2] "In the case of associated vacancies spontaneous outwards movement of one oxygen ion from a subsurface layer is observed."
[3] "Adsorption of O2 on these surface defects produces in general diamagnetic peroxide (O2 2) species due to transfer of two electrons to the molecule, except when only one electron is available in which case paramagnetic superoxide (O2 ) species appear."
[4] "The activation energy for this bond breaking remains to be determined,and is the subject of an ongoing study."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. This energy barrier is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When oxygen is adsorbed onto the surface, it can lead to the formation of peroxide species (O2 2) due to the transfer of two electrons to the molecule, unless only one electron is available, in which case superoxide (O2) species are formed. The energy required for the breaking of the oxygen-oxygen bond, which would lead to the production of oxide ions, remains to be determined and is currently the focus of ongoing research.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过要求氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。这一能量壁垒对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当氧气吸附到表面时，它可能导致过氧化物种（O2 2）的形成，由于将两个电子转移到分子上，除非仅有一个电子可用，在这种情况下形成超氧化物种（O2）。需要断裂氧-氧键的能量，以导致氧化物离子的产生，仍待确定，目前是正在进行的研究焦点。
