[1] "In the process of reoxidation of the previously reduced solid, electrons (four in total) are transferred from Ce3+ ions to one incoming O2 molecule to give in the end two oxide (O2) ions in lattice positions; paramagnetic O2 (superoxide) and diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species have been identified with EPR (for O2 2) and vibrational [47] spectroscopies as products of the first stages of this process."
[2] "It seems reasonable to assume that completing this reoxidation process will require having in close proximity the four Ce3+ ions that donate the electrons and the two anion vacancies that must accept the O2 ions."
[3] "In the case of associated vacancies spontaneous outwards movement of one oxygen ion from a subsurface layer is observed."
[4] "Oxygen adsorption on these defects leads to electron transfer to the O2 molecule, forming peroxide species, except when only one electron is available in which case paramagnetic O2 species appear; the adsorption energies involved are computed and discussed."
[5] "This is explained on the basis of the relative energies of the p* orbitals of the dioxygen species and the 4f1 levels of cerium, clearly visualized with density of states plots."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by transferring electrons from metal ions (Ce3+ in this case) to oxygen molecules. This process forms paramagnetic superoxide (O2) or diamagnetic peroxide (O2 2) species, depending on the number of electrons available. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When vacancies associate, one oxygen ion moves outwards from a subsurface layer. Oxygen adsorption on these defects results in electron transfer to the oxygen molecule, forming peroxide species unless only one electron is available, in which case a paramagnetic superoxide species appears. The relative energies of the p* orbitals of the dioxygen species and the 4f1 levels of cerium are responsible for the electron transfer process. This is visualized using density of states plots.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过将金属离子（本例中的Ce3+）的电子转移到氧气分子来运作。这个过程形成了顺磁超氧（O2）或顺磁过氧（O2 2）物种，具体取决于可用的电子数量。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。当空位聚集时，一个氧离子从次表面层向外移动。氧吸附在这些缺陷上导致电子转移到氧分子，形成过氧物种，除非只有一个电子可用，在这种情况下会出现顺磁超氧物种。顺磁超氧物种是由氧分子的p*轨道和铈的4f1能级之间的相对能量决定的。这一点通过密度态图可视化。
