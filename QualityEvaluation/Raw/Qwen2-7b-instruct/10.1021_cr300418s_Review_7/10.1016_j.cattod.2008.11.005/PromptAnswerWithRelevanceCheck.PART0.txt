[1] "The simulation of the effect of reduction on the ceria surface has been already undertaken by other authors; a number of these are discussed in a recently appeared review [14]."
[2] "Although some study has been carried out using HartreeFock-type approaches on finite cluster models [1517] or periodic models [17], in almost all cases density functional theory (DFT) has been the basis of the calculations."
[3] "In the present work, the DFT + U method is used; the hybrid functional method, although trying to correct the DFT adequacies in a more general (less ad hoc) way and consequently being more reliable in principle, gives incorrect results in some cases [34,35]."
[4] "The adsorption of O2 on vacancy pairs and triads was studied also. It was found that in general peroxide species appeared,accompanied by respectively two and four Ce3+ ions (i.e. two electrons were transferred to the adsorbed molecule)."
[5] "Only in one case (for one of the vacancy pair sub-configurations) the adsorbed species evolved with breaking of the OO bond and full reoxidation of the surface defect to the 0V structure; this behaviour appeared in this latter case probably due to some specific characteristic of the initial atomic arrangement, with the O2 molecule above the defect, chosen in the energy minimization."
[6] "Presumably, only by elongating the OO bond (as may happen during thermal activation of molecular vibrations) can the s* orbital be lowered in energy to the extent necessary to make possible that transfer."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reaction with organic substrates. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen adsorption and enhances the surface reactivity, thereby increasing the catalytic efficiency. However, too low ΔEv might result in a lack of stability for the oxygen vacancy sites, potentially reducing the overall catalytic performance. The balance between ΔEv and the stability of the oxygen vacancy sites is essential for achieving optimal catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences the reactivity and stability of the oxide surface, impacting its ability to catalyze oxidation reactions efficiently. The presence of oxygen vacancies provides reactive sites for the adsorption of oxygen, which subsequently reacts with organic substrates. The energy barrier (ΔEv) for the formation of these vacancies determines the ease with which oxygen can be adsorbed onto the surface, affecting the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability. A lower ΔEv enables easier oxygen adsorption, enhancing the surface's reactivity and catalytic efficiency. However, excessively low ΔEv may compromise the stability of the oxygen vacancy sites, potentially diminishing the catalytic performance. Therefore, a judicious balance between ΔEv and the stability of the oxygen vacancy sites is crucial for optimizing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为活性位点来吸附氧气并随后与有机底物反应而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv有利于更轻松地吸附氧气，增强表面反应性，从而提高催化效率。然而，ΔEv过低可能导致氧空位位点的稳定性降低，可能减小整体催化性能。ΔEv与氧空位位点稳定性的平衡对于实现最佳催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

氧空位的存在提供了一个反应位点，用于吸附氧气，随后与有机底物反应。氧空位形成所需的能量壁垒（ΔEv）决定了氧气更容易吸附到表面的程度，影响表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv使氧气吸附更为容易，增强表面的反应性和催化效率。然而，ΔEv过低可能会损害氧空位位点的稳定性，可能减少催化性能。因此，ΔEv与氧空位位点稳定性的适当平衡对于优化氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

[1] "In the process of reoxidation of the previously reduced solid, electrons (four in total) are transferred from Ce3+ ions to one incoming O2 molecule to give in the end two oxide (O2) ions in lattice positions; paramagnetic O2 (superoxide) and diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species have been identified with EPR (for O2 2) and vibrational [47] spectroscopies as products of the first stages of this process."
[2] "It seems reasonable to assume that completing this reoxidation process will require having in close proximity the four Ce3+ ions that donate the electrons and the two anion vacancies that must accept the O2 ions."
[3] "In the case of associated vacancies spontaneous outwards movement of one oxygen ion from a subsurface layer is observed."
[4] "Oxygen adsorption on these defects leads to electron transfer to the O2 molecule, forming peroxide species, except when only one electron is available in which case paramagnetic O2 species appear; the adsorption energies involved are computed and discussed."
[5] "This is explained on the basis of the relative energies of the p* orbitals of the dioxygen species and the 4f1 levels of cerium, clearly visualized with density of states plots."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by transferring electrons from metal ions (Ce3+ in this case) to oxygen molecules. This process forms paramagnetic superoxide (O2) or diamagnetic peroxide (O2 2) species, depending on the number of electrons available. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When vacancies associate, one oxygen ion moves outwards from a subsurface layer. Oxygen adsorption on these defects results in electron transfer to the oxygen molecule, forming peroxide species unless only one electron is available, in which case a paramagnetic superoxide species appears. The relative energies of the p* orbitals of the dioxygen species and the 4f1 levels of cerium are responsible for the electron transfer process. This is visualized using density of states plots.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过将金属离子（本例中的Ce3+）的电子转移到氧气分子来运作。这个过程形成了顺磁超氧（O2）或顺磁过氧（O2 2）物种，具体取决于可用的电子数量。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。当空位聚集时，一个氧离子从次表面层向外移动。氧吸附在这些缺陷上导致电子转移到氧分子，形成过氧物种，除非只有一个电子可用，在这种情况下会出现顺磁超氧物种。顺磁超氧物种是由氧分子的p*轨道和铈的4f1能级之间的相对能量决定的。这一点通过密度态图可视化。

[1] "From this point of view it was interesting to observe, during an atomistic simulation work [8], that anion vacancies had apparently a tendency to associate on the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2, that was predicted to be the most stable one, but not in the (1 1 0) surface,second in stability."
[2] "The simulation of the effect of reduction on the ceria surface has been already undertaken by other authors; a number of these are discussed in a recently appeared review [14]."
[3] "It was found that for each one of these vacancy defects different specific sub-configurations could appear (depending on the particular position of the ions in the unit cell of the model)."
[4] "The self-consistent calculation led to equal spin directions for all the Ce3+ ions present (i.e. to a ferromagnetic- type spin configuration); in other cases some of the Ce3+ ions appeared with spin orientation opposite to the other ones,suggesting an antiferromagnetic interaction."
[5] "The adsorption energy of O2 on a single vacancy is computed to be 2.10 eV if starting from the vacancy sub-configuration of lowest energy (1Va, displayed in Fig. 2)."
[6] "Only in one case (for one of the vacancy pair sub-configurations) the adsorbed species evolved with breaking of the OO bond and full reoxidation of the surface defect to the 0V structure."
[7] "The examination of the DOS plots obtained for the species adsorbed on vacancy pairs or triads (Fig. 9) shows again the peaks above the valence band that are due to the p* orbitals of the peroxide ion, and clearly above them the 4f1 levels of the remaining Ce3+ ions."
[8] "A higher degree of electron transfer, that would be necessary for OO bond breaking, is not seen to occur here spontaneously; this is ascribed to the rather high energy of the dioxygen s* orbital that must receive additional electron density to complete the process."

[5] "The calculations show that after interaction of one oxygen molecule with a single vacancy all Ce ions are in the Ce4+ formal redox state and the total spin density is zero everywhere, implying that two electrons are transferred to the molecule (whether this happens in one or two steps is of no concern here) to form a diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species; in the latter the interatomic distance is d(OO) = 1.44 A (Fig. 8, model 1VO2)."
[6] "This means that either the dioxygen moiety has a fast oscillation movement which effectively averages the environment of its two extremes, or that the complex described here formed on the anion vacancy at the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2 is not an appropriate model for the species observed by EPR."

1. In the reoxidation process, four electrons are transferred from Ce3+ ions to an incoming O2 molecule, resulting in the formation of paramagnetic O2 (superoxide) and diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species.
2. During an atomistic simulation, anion vacancies tended to associate on the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2, which is predicted to be the most stable surface, but not on the (1 1 0) surface, which is second in stability.
3. It is assumed that to complete the reoxidation process, the four Ce3+ ions donating electrons and the two anion vacancies accepting O2 ions need to be in close proximity.
4. When anion vacancies associate, one oxygen ion spontaneously moves outwards from a subsurface layer.

7. Only in one case, for a specific atomic arrangement, did the adsorbed species undergo full reoxidation of the surface defect to the 0V structure.
