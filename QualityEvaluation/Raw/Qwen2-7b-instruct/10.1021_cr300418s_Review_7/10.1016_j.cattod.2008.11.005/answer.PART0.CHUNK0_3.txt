[1] "In the process of reoxidation of the previously reduced solid, electrons (four in total) are transferred from Ce3+ ions to one incoming O2 molecule to give in the end two oxide (O2) ions in lattice positions; paramagnetic O2 (superoxide) and diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species have been identified with EPR (for O2 2) and vibrational [47] spectroscopies as products of the first stages of this process."
[2] "From this point of view it was interesting to observe, during an atomistic simulation work [8], that anion vacancies had apparently a tendency to associate on the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2, that was predicted to be the most stable one, but not in the (1 1 0) surface,second in stability."
[3] "It seems reasonable to assume that completing this reoxidation process will require having in close proximity the four Ce3+ ions that donate the electrons and the two anion vacancies that must accept the O2 ions."
[4] "In the case of associated vacancies spontaneous outwards movement of one oxygen ion from a subsurface layer is observed."
[5] "The calculations show that after interaction of one oxygen molecule with a single vacancy all Ce ions are in the Ce4+ formal redox state and the total spin density is zero everywhere, implying that two electrons are transferred to the molecule (whether this happens in one or two steps is of no concern here) to form a diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species; in the latter the interatomic distance is d(OO) = 1.44 A (Fig. 8, model 1VO2)."
[6] "This means that either the dioxygen moiety has a fast oscillation movement which effectively averages the environment of its two extremes, or that the complex described here formed on the anion vacancy at the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2 is not an appropriate model for the species observed by EPR."
[7] "Only in one case (for one of the vacancy pair sub-configurations) the adsorbed species evolved with breaking of the OO bond and full reoxidation of the surface defect to the 0V structure; this behaviour appeared in this latter case probably due to some specific characteristic of the initial atomic arrangement, with the O2 molecule above the defect, chosen in the energy minimization."
[8] "The examination of the DOS plots obtained for the species adsorbed on vacancy pairs or triads (Fig. 9) shows again the peaks above the valence band that are due to the p* orbitals of the peroxide ion, and clearly above them the 4f1 levels of the remaining Ce3+ ions."

1. In the reoxidation process, four electrons are transferred from Ce3+ ions to an incoming O2 molecule, resulting in the formation of paramagnetic O2 (superoxide) and diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species.
2. During an atomistic simulation, anion vacancies tended to associate on the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2, which is predicted to be the most stable surface, but not on the (1 1 0) surface, which is second in stability.
3. It is assumed that to complete the reoxidation process, the four Ce3+ ions donating electrons and the two anion vacancies accepting O2 ions need to be in close proximity.
4. When anion vacancies associate, one oxygen ion spontaneously moves outwards from a subsurface layer.
5. Interaction of one oxygen molecule with a single vacancy results in the formation of a diamagnetic O2 2 (peroxide) species, with an interatomic distance of d(OO) = 1.44 A.
6. The complex formed on the anion vacancy at the (1 1 1) surface of CeO2 is not an appropriate model for the species observed by EPR, either because of a fast oscillation movement of the dioxygen moiety or because of different surface vacancy models.
7. Only in one case, for a specific atomic arrangement, did the adsorbed species undergo full reoxidation of the surface defect to the 0V structure.
8. The DOS plots for species adsorbed on vacancy pairs or triads show peaks above the valence band due to the p* orbitals of the peroxide ion and the 4f1 levels of the remaining Ce3+ ions.

1. 在还原过程之后，四个电子从Ce3+离子转移到一个进入的O2分子，形成了顺磁性O2（超氧）和反磁性O2 2（过氧化物）物种。
2. 在原子模拟过程中，阴离子空位倾向于在预测为最稳定的（1 1 1）表面聚集在CeO2上，但不会在预测为第二稳定的（1 1 0）表面上聚集。
3. 假设为了完成还原过程，需要让捐赠电子的四个Ce3+离子和接受O2离子的两个阴离子空位靠近。
4. 当阴离子空位聚集时，一个氧离子自发地从下层移动到外层。
5. 与单个空位相互作用的一个氧分子形成了一个反磁性O2 2（过氧化物）物种，其原子间距为d(OO) = 1.44 A。
6. 形成在CeO2的（1 1 1）表面的阴离子空位上的复合物不是通过EPR观察到的物种的适当模型，这可能是因为二氧物种有快速振荡运动或者因为不同的表面空位模型。
7. 只有在一种情况下，由于特定的原子排列，吸附的物种才经历了表面缺陷的完全氧化，恢复到了0V结构。
8. 吸附在空位对或三元组上的物种的DOS图显示了由于过氧化物离子的p*轨道和剩余的Ce3+离子的4f1水平而出现的峰高于价带。
