[1] "The simulation of the effect of reduction on the ceria surface has been already undertaken by other authors; a number of these are discussed in a recently appeared review [14]."
[2] "Although some study has been carried out using HartreeFock-type approaches on finite cluster models [1517] or periodic models [17], in almost all cases density functional theory (DFT) has been the basis of the calculations."
[3] "In the present work, the DFT + U method is used; the hybrid functional method, although trying to correct the DFT adequacies in a more general (less ad hoc) way and consequently being more reliable in principle, gives incorrect results in some cases [34,35]."
[4] "The adsorption of O2 on vacancy pairs and triads was studied also. It was found that in general peroxide species appeared,accompanied by respectively two and four Ce3+ ions (i.e. two electrons were transferred to the adsorbed molecule)."
[5] "Only in one case (for one of the vacancy pair sub-configurations) the adsorbed species evolved with breaking of the OO bond and full reoxidation of the surface defect to the 0V structure; this behaviour appeared in this latter case probably due to some specific characteristic of the initial atomic arrangement, with the O2 molecule above the defect, chosen in the energy minimization."
[6] "Presumably, only by elongating the OO bond (as may happen during thermal activation of molecular vibrations) can the s* orbital be lowered in energy to the extent necessary to make possible that transfer."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reaction with organic substrates. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen adsorption and enhances the surface reactivity, thereby increasing the catalytic efficiency. However, too low ΔEv might result in a lack of stability for the oxygen vacancy sites, potentially reducing the overall catalytic performance. The balance between ΔEv and the stability of the oxygen vacancy sites is essential for achieving optimal catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences the reactivity and stability of the oxide surface, impacting its ability to catalyze oxidation reactions efficiently. The presence of oxygen vacancies provides reactive sites for the adsorption of oxygen, which subsequently reacts with organic substrates. The energy barrier (ΔEv) for the formation of these vacancies determines the ease with which oxygen can be adsorbed onto the surface, affecting the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability. A lower ΔEv enables easier oxygen adsorption, enhancing the surface's reactivity and catalytic efficiency. However, excessively low ΔEv may compromise the stability of the oxygen vacancy sites, potentially diminishing the catalytic performance. Therefore, a judicious balance between ΔEv and the stability of the oxygen vacancy sites is crucial for optimizing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为活性位点来吸附氧气并随后与有机底物反应而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv有利于更轻松地吸附氧气，增强表面反应性，从而提高催化效率。然而，ΔEv过低可能导致氧空位位点的稳定性降低，可能减小整体催化性能。ΔEv与氧空位位点稳定性的平衡对于实现最佳催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。
