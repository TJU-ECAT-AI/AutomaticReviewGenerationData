[1] "The discovery of VCs in ceria is of great significance. As pointed out by Campbell and Peden,13 the groups of exposed Ce3+ ions in the VCs would become a potentially potent surface site for catalysis, as adsorbed gases or reaction intermediates could interact simultaneously with several Ce3+ ions."
[2] "Consequently, oxygen vacancy defects can play a central role: surface lattice oxygen may act as an oxidant for adsorbates, thus creating oxygen vacancies i.e., Marsvan Krevelen mechanism4; and vacancies may serve as binding sites for catalytically active species, thus promoting activity of the catalyst e.g., in the WGS reaction catalyzed by Au/CeO2.5,6"
[3] "We show that the individual surface and subsurface vacancies have very similar stabilities; the vacancy dimer consisting of two surface vacancies, which is not reported experimentally, is stable in theory; between the two vacancy trimers observed in experiments, the triangular surface vacancy cluster is more stable than the double linear surface vacancy cluster containing a subsurface vacancy, which agrees with some experiments but disagrees with some others; and the linear vacancy tetramer emerges as the most stable among the possible tetramers containing subsurface vacancies, although it is less stable than those containing no subsurface vacancies."
[4] "These findings are rationalized in terms of the electronic change upon the removal of oxygen, namely, the localization of resulting excess electrons on Ce f orbitals."
[5] "Moreover, the similar energies of the two defects calculated in the present work agree with the experiment finding that SVs and SSVs have similar concentrations on the slightly reduced surfaces."
[6] "Starting from DLSVC,we can create three distinct yet stable vacancy tetramers by removing one of the following O atoms, i.e., OI, OII, and OIII Fig. 4, which are neighboring a sixfold, a fivefold, and a fourfold Ce3+ ion, respectively."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves surface lattice oxygen acting as an oxidant for adsorbates, creating oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for catalysis. Oxygen vacancies can serve as binding sites for active species, enhancing the catalyst's activity, exemplified in the WGS reaction catalyzed by Au/CeO2.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for catalytic activity. 

3. The stability of oxygen vacancy clusters depends on the arrangement of Ce3+ ions. The triangular surface vacancy cluster is more stable than the double linear surface vacancy cluster containing a subsurface vacancy. Linear vacancy tetramers emerge as the most stable among tetramers containing subsurface vacancies.

4. The localization of excess electrons on Ce f orbitals explains the electronic changes upon oxygen vacancy formation. This rationalizes the stability of different oxygen vacancy clusters.

5. The similar energies of surface and subsurface vacancies indicate that they have comparable stabilities, supporting the experimental observation that SVs and SSVs have similar concentrations on slightly reduced surfaces.

6. Vacancy tetramers can be created by removing oxygen atoms from DLSVC, specifically those neighboring a sixfold, a fivefold, or a fourfold Ce3+ ion.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面晶格氧作为吸附剂的氧化剂，产生氧空位，这对于催化至关重要。氧空位可以作为活性物种的结合点，增强催化剂的活性，例如在由Au/CeO2催化的WGS反应中。

2. 氧空位形成（ΔEv）的能量决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这对催化活性至关重要。

3. 氧空位簇的稳定性取决于Ce3+离子的排列方式。三角形表面氧空位簇比包含亚表面氧空位的双线性表面氧空位簇更稳定。线性氧空位四聚体在包含亚表面氧空位的四聚体中是最稳定的。

4. 超过氧导致的额外电子在Ce f轨道上的定位解释了氧空位形成时的电子变化。这合理地解释了不同氧空位簇的稳定性。

5. 表面和亚表面氧空位具有相似的能量，表明它们有相当的稳定性，支持实验观察到表面氧空位（SVs）和亚表面氧空位（SSVs）在轻微还原表面上具有相似的浓度。

6. 可以通过从DLSVC去除特定位置的氧原子来创建氧空位四聚体，这些氧原子邻近六折、五折或四折的Ce3+离子。
