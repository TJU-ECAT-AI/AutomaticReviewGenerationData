[1] "Defects such as oxygen vacancies dominate the electronic and chemical properties of ceria."
[2] "In this work, we use density-functional theory with the addition of the Hubbard U term to investigate various oxygen vacancies,including the vacancy monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer."
[3] "The discovery of VCs in ceria is of great significance. As pointed out by Campbell and Peden,13 the groups of exposed Ce3+ ions in the VCs would become a potentially potent surface site for catalysis, as adsorbed gases or reaction intermediates could interact simultaneously with several Ce3+ ions."
[4] "The present paper is organized as follows. Calculation details are given in Sec. II. In Sec. III, we introduce all types of vacancies considered and report vacancy formation energies."
[5] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism4; and vacan- cies may serve as binding sites for catalytically active spe- cies, thus promoting activity of the catalyst e.g., in the WGS reaction catalyzed by Au/CeO2."
[6] "These findings are rationalized in terms of the electronic change upon the removal of oxygen, namely, the localization of resulting excess electrons on Ce f orbitals."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies act as oxidants for adsorbates, facilitating the release of oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier vacancy formation, potentially enhancing the surface's ability to facilitate reactions and thus increasing catalytic activity. The localized excess electrons on Ce f orbitals contribute to the stabilization of these vacancies, affecting their stability and, consequently, their contribution to the overall catalytic performance of the oxide material.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位起作用。氧空位作为吸附物的氧化剂，促进氧气的释放。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成空位，可能增强表面促进反应的能力，从而提高催化活性。Ce f轨道上局部化的过剩电子有助于稳定这些空位，影响它们的稳定性，进而影响氧化物材料整体催化性能的贡献。
