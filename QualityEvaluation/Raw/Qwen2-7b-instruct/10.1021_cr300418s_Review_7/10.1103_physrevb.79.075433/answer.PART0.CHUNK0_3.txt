[1] "In this work, we use density-functional theory with the addition of the Hubbard U term to investigate various oxygen vacancies,including the vacancy monomer, dimer, trimer, and tetramer, in which subsurface vacancies can also be involved."
[2] "We show that the individual surface and subsurface vacancies have very similar stabilities; the vacancy dimer consisting of two surface vacancies, which is not reported experimentally, is stable in theory;"
[3] "The vacancy dimer consisting of two surface vacancies, which is not reported experimentally, is stable in theory;"
[4] "Between the two vacancy trimers observed in experiments, the triangular surface vacancy cluster is more stable than the double linear surface vacancy cluster containing a subsurface vacancy, which agrees with some experiments but disagrees with some others;"
[5] "The linear vacancy tetramer emerges as the most stable among the possible tetramers containing subsurface vacancies, although it is less stable than those containing no subsurface vacancies."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the action of surface lattice oxygen acting as an oxidant for adsorbates, leading to the creation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide. This mechanism is crucial in understanding the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining these properties. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher stability of the vacancy, which can enhance the surface's ability to catalyze reactions and oxidize substances efficiently.

2. Oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is a critical factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest more stable vacancies, which can lead to increased catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power. The mechanism's operation relies on the surface lattice oxygen's ability to oxidize adsorbates, creating vacancies. These vacancies can then serve as binding sites for catalytically active species, enhancing the catalyst's performance. The stability of the vacancies, as indicated by ΔEv, influences their effectiveness in these roles.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及表面晶格氧作为吸附剂的氧化剂作用，导致氧化物表面形成氧空位。这一机制对于理解氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定这些性质方面起着决定性的作用。较低的ΔEv通常表明空位的稳定性更高，这可以增强表面的催化活性和氧化物质的能力。

2. 氧空位形成能（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv值表明更稳定的空位，这可以增加催化活性并增强氧化能力。该机制的操作依赖于表面晶格氧对吸附剂的氧化能力，从而形成空位。这些空位可以作为活性物种的结合点，增强催化剂的性能。空位的稳定性，如由ΔEv表示，影响它们在这些角色中的有效性。
