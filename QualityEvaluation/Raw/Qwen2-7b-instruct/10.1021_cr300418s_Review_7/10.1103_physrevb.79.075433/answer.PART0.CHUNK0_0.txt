[1] "Defects such as oxygen vacancies dominate the electronic and chemical properties of ceria."
[2] "The discovery of VCs in ceria is of great significance. As pointed out by Campbell and Peden,13 the groups of exposed Ce3+ ions in the VCs would become a potentially potent surface site for catalysis, as adsorbed gases or reaction intermediates could interact simultaneously with several Ce3+ ions."
[3] "The energy required to form the oxygen defects, ΔEv, plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
[4] "In the case of oxygen vacancy formation, the energy required for the formation of the vacancy (ΔEv) significantly influences the stability and hence the catalytic performance of the material."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves surface lattice oxygen acting as an oxidant for adsorbates, creating oxygen vacancies. This process is fundamental in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is critical because it determines the stability of the oxide surface and consequently its catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.
