[1] "In the paper, the methodology of computing the correlations between continuous descriptors of catalytic materials and their performance in the catalysed process was addressed."
[2] "Continuous descriptors are typically molar frac- tions of individual components of the catalyst, whereas the performance is represented most frequently by yield or selectivity of reaction products or conversion of key feed components."
[3] "Measures of various kinds of correlation are recalled, and their descriptor-wise application to catalytic data for computing correlations between the composition and performance of catalysts is presented."
[4] "The paper also compares the application of correlation measures to catalytic data on the one hand with the analysis of variance, on the other hand with the application of regression trees."
[5] "As a case study, the presented approaches are applied to data from high-temperature synthesis of hydrocyanic acid."

The methodology for computing correlations between continuous descriptors of catalytic materials and their performance in catalysed processes is addressed in the paper. Continuous descriptors refer to the molar fractions of individual components of the catalyst, while the performance is typically measured by the yield or selectivity of reaction products or the conversion of key feed components. Various kinds of correlation measures are recalled and applied to catalytic data to compute correlations between the composition and performance of catalysts. The paper also compares the application of correlation measures with the analysis of variance and regression trees. A detailed case study using data from high-temperature synthesis of hydrocyanic acid is presented.
