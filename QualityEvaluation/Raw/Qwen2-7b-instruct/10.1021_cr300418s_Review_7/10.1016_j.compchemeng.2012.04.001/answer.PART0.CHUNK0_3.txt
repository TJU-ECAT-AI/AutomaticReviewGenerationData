[1] "In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the adsorption of an oxygen molecule onto the oxide surface, followed by the dissociation of the oxygen molecule into atomic oxygen. This atomic oxygen then reacts with a reactant molecule to form an oxide product and regenerate the oxide surface."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxygen vacancy can be easily created, which enhances the surface reactivity and, consequently, the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide."
[3] "The stability of the oxide surface against oxygen vacancy formation also affects the duration of the catalytic activity. Oxides with higher stability against oxygen vacancy formation tend to maintain their catalytic activity for longer periods."

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷维尔机制涉及将氧气分子吸附到氧化物表面，随后氧气分子分解为原子氧。然后，原子氧与反应物分子反应生成氧化产物并再生氧化物表面。

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着可以轻松创建氧空位，从而增强表面反应性，并且相应地提高氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力。

3. 氧化物对氧空位形成的稳定性也影响催化活性的持续时间。稳定性更高的氧化物更有可能保持其催化活性较长的时间。
