[1] "Although this is an oversimplification since we have considered neither actual A Hf data for metal formates and methoxides, nor the product distribution from the decomposition of these species, this difference suggests that the difference in formate and methoxide stabilities results essentially from the shallower thermodynamic well characteristic of the methoxide."
[2] "The analysis above suggests that the decomposition of methanol via methoxide and formaldehyde intermediates on transition metal surfaces is straightforward. The sequence of dehydrogenations is the same in all of the examples cited; the stabilities of methoxides on different metals are predicted by a simple linear free energy relationship."
[3] "Failure to recognize that the Group VIII and IB metals belong on different “volcanoes” would lead to exactly opposite strategies for catalyst promotion. Surface modifications (e.g., alloying) which would allow one to interpolate between the thermodynamic properties of adsorbates on silver and copper would be predicted to produce a catalyst more active than either of these according to the volcano depicted in fig. 1, but would actually produce a monotonic change in activity from copper to silver if the decomposition of a common surface intermediate were rate determining in all cases."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can enhance the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions. Consequently, materials with a reduced ΔEv are expected to exhibit higher catalytic activity and better oxidizing power in these reactions.

火星-克瑞维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（Ov）来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更为稳定，这可以增强表面促进氧化反应的能力。因此，预计具有降低ΔEv的材料在这些反应中的催化活性更高且氧化能力更强。
