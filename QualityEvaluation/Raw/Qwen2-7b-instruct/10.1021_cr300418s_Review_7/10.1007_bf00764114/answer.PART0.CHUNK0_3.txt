Catalysis Letters 8 (1991) 175-184 175 LINEAR FREE ENERGY RELATIONSHIPS FOR C 1-OXYGENATE DECOMPOSITION ON TRANSITION METAL SURFACES Mark A. BARTEAU ... On the IB metals, the principal product of CH30 decomposition observed in TPD experiments is formaldehyde, an unsurprising result since these metals were the first catalysts for the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. In contrast, on the Group VIII metals, in the absence of surface modifiers such as sulfur or oxygen, formaldehyde is never observed in methanol TPD; dehydrogenation goes to completion and the sole products are CO plus H 2. The production of CO and H 2 suggests that methoxide decomposition proceeds via a sequence of dehydrogenation reactions, the first of which would produce formaldehyde on the surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the reaction's activity and oxidizing power.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中运作，通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。当ΔEv较低时，它促进了氧空位的形成，从而增强了反应的活性和氧化能力。
