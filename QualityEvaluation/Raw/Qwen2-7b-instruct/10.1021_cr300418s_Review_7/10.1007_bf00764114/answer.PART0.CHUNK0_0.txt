[1] "Although this is an oversimplification since we have considered neither actual A Hf data for metal formates and methoxides, nor the product distribution from the decomposition of these species, this difference suggests that the difference in formate and methoxide stabilities results essentially from the shallower thermodynamic well characteristic of the methoxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for this process (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of the oxygen vacancy, leading to increased catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过要求在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。这一过程所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位的形成更为容易，导致了更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。

[1] "The reason is that formaldehyde (and carbonyl compounds in general) are bound differently on the two. On the IB metals, aldehydes and ketones bind weakly via donation of the lone pair electrons from the carbonyl oxygen to the metal surface in an a(O) configuration. On clean surfaces the Group VIII metals aldehydes and ketones are bound in an 7/2(C, O) configuration, with the carbonyl axis nearly parallel to the surface and with the C = O bond strongly rehybridized."

The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in the way it affects the binding of carbonyl compounds. On IB metals, aldehydes and ketones bind weakly via donation of lone pair electrons from the carbonyl oxygen to the metal surface in an a(O) configuration. On Group VIII metals, these compounds bind in a 7/2(C, O) configuration, with the carbonyl axis nearly parallel to the surface and the C = O bond strongly rehybridized.

氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性在于它影响了羰基化合物的结合方式。对于IB金属，醛类和酮类通过从羰基氧捐赠孤对电子与金属表面以a(O)配置结合，结合力较弱。对于第VIII组金属，这些化合物以7/2(C, O)配置结合，羰基轴几乎平行于表面，且C = O键强烈重杂化。
