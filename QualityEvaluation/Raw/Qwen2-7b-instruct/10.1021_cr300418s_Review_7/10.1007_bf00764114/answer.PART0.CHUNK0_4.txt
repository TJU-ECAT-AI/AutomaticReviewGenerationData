The decomposition of formic acid has long been a common test reaction for examining the activity of metal catalysts. The variation of the activity of transi- tion metals for this reaction forms the basis for perhaps the best known example of a "Balandin volcano curve" illustrating Sabatier's principle of the optimum instability of catalytic intermediates [1].

The IB metals do not represent the complementary leg of the "volcano" to the Group VIIIs; rather they give a parallel but separate family of points vs. the Group VIII metals. The two lines in fig. 2 for the peak temperatures (Tp) for formate decomposition are given by the equations (Group VIII) Tp(K) = 2.54[-AHy (kcal/mol)] + 216 (Group IB) Tp = 2.63[- AH/ + 384. (1) (2)

As depicted, this clearly does not represent a linear free energy relationship of the sort implicit in Sabatier's principle or in the classical explanation of the Balandin volcano curve.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability because it facilitates the creation of reactive oxygen species, which are essential for the oxidation process. Conversely, a higher ΔEv may lead to decreased catalytic efficiency due to reduced oxygen availability for the reaction.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。氧空位形成的能量要求对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明较高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它促进了反应性氧物种的产生，这对氧化过程至关重要。相反，较高的ΔEv可能会导致催化效率降低，因为会减少可用于反应的氧气量。
