[1] "The disturbance caused by doping is reflected by the distance between the six oxygen atoms shown in Fig. 6 and the Ce and dopant atoms they bind to."
[2] "The stability of the Cu oxide is greater than that of Ag, which in turn is greater than that of Au."
[3] "Naively, one would expect that forming a vacancy in Au-doped ceria would require the least energy and that the oxygen atoms in the Cu-doped compound would be less willing to leave the oxide."
[4] "In Au2O3 the distances between the oxygen atoms and Au vary between 1.93 and 2.07 Å, the OAg distance in Ag2O is 2.05 Å and the OCu in the Cu oxides (CuO and CuO2) vary between 1.82 and 2.00 Å."
[5] "By comparing the effects of various elements on the energy of vacancy formation in doped TiO2 or CeO2, we have found that two factors are the most important."

1. The disturbance caused by doping is reflected by the distances between the oxygen atoms and the cerium or dopant atoms they bind to.
2. The Cu oxide is the most stable, followed by Ag, and then Au.
3. Naively, one might expect Au doping to require the least energy for vacancy formation, and Cu doping to require the most.
4. In Au2O3, the oxygen atoms are 1.93 to 2.07 Å from Au, in Ag2O they are 2.05 Å, and in Cu oxides they are 1.82 to 2.00 Å.
5. Two factors are crucial in determining the energy of vacancy formation in doped oxides: the valence of the dopant element and the structure difference between the dopant oxide and the host oxide.

1.掺杂对距离的影响体现在氧原子与铈或掺杂原子之间的距离上。
2. 铜氧化物的稳定性最高，其次是银，最后是金。
3. 直观地讲，金掺杂可能需要最少的能量来形成空位，而铜掺杂可能需要最多的能量。
4. 在Au2O3中，氧原子与Au的距离为1.93至2.07 Å，在Ag2O中为2.05 Å，在铜氧化物（CuO和CuO2）中为1.82至2.00 Å。
5. 在掺杂氧化物中确定空位形成能的两个关键因素：掺杂元素的电荷以及掺杂氧化物与宿主氧化物的结构差异。
