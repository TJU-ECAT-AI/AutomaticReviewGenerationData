[1] "An important question is the extent to which the features discovered in our previous work [39] and in the present study can be extended to other systems."
[2] "Although extrapolating chemical behavior is not a safe endeavor, we wish to emphasize several features that may be general."
[3] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive."
[4] "In an oxidation reaction, the compound being oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the surface and creates an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase O2 adsorbs on the vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment that it finds there."
[5] "One atom in this activated O2 oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, and the other heals the oxygen vacancy in the surface."
[6] "The oxygen atom activated by the presence of the dopant also might initiate a dehydrogenation reaction by taking a hydrogen atom from a gas-phase molecule to form a hydroxyl."
[7] "In this scenario, doping improves the catalytic properties of the surface if it satisfies two conflicting requirements."
[8] "On the one hand, it must weaken the bond of the oxygen atoms to the oxide surface to allow the oxidation of the gas-phase reactant."
[9] "On the other hand, this weakening must not be so pronounced that the vacancy can not be healed by reaction with gas-phase oxygen."
[10] "Thermal stability of the catalyst may not be a critical issue for doped oxides, especially for low-temperature oxidation reactions."
[11] "In favorable cases, doping improves the thermal stability of the catalyst."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by allowing the compound being oxidized to take an oxygen atom from the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase oxygen adsorbs on this vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment, allowing it to oxidize a gas-phase molecule. The other atom in the activated oxygen molecule heals the oxygen vacancy, continuing the catalytic cycle. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more reactive and capable of catalyzing oxidation reactions at lower temperatures. The stability of the catalyst may not be a critical issue for doped oxides used in low-temperature oxidation reactions, and in favorable cases, doping can improve the thermal stability of the catalyst.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过允许被氧化物中的化合物从表面取氧原子，形成一个氧空位。气相氧气吸附在这个空位上，并在电子丰富的环境中被激活，允许它氧化气相分子。激活的氧分子中的另一个原子修复了表面的氧空位，继续催化循环。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）具有重要意义，因为它决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物更活跃，在较低温度下能够催化氧化反应。催化剂的稳定性可能不是用于低温氧化反应的掺杂氧化物的关键问题，在有利情况下，掺杂可以提高催化剂的热稳定性。
