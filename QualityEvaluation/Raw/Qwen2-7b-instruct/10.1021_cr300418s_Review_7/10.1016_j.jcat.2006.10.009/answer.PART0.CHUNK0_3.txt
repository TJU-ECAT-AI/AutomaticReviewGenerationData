[1] "An important question is the extent to which the features discovered in our previous work [39] and in the present study can be extended to other systems."
[2] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive."
[3] "The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature. We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide."
[4] "Table 2 gives the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation at the surface of ceria doped with Au, Ag, and Cu."
[5] "Because we have calculated only the total energy of the reactants, products, and intermediates involved in the catalytic oxidation of CO, we can discuss only the equilibrium behavior of the system."

1. The extent to which the features discovered in previous studies can be extended to other systems is a crucial question. 
2. Doped oxides use a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism in oxidation reactions, where the dopant makes the oxide surface more reactive by weakening the bond between the oxide and oxygen atoms.
3. The high energy required to form an oxygen vacancy is why oxides typically perform oxidation at high temperatures. By weakening the bond between oxygen and the oxide, the dopant reduces the oxidation temperature.
4. Table 2 presents the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy at the surface of ceria doped with Au, Ag, and Cu.
5. The calculated total energy of reactants, products, and intermediates in the catalytic oxidation of CO enables discussion of the system's equilibrium behavior, not its activation energy.

1. 上述特征在其他系统中的应用范围是一个关键问题。
2. 氧化物通过Marsvan Krevelen机制催化氧化，其中掺杂剂通过削弱氧化物与氧原子之间的键来使表面更活跃。
3. 形成氧空位所需的高能量是氧化物通常在高温下进行氧化的原因。掺杂剂通过削弱氧与氧化物之间的键降低氧化温度。
4. 表2提供了Au、Ag和Cu掺杂的氧化铈表面形成氧空位的能量。
5. 计算CO催化氧化反应中反应物、产物和中间体的总能量允许讨论系统的平衡行为，而不是其活化能。
