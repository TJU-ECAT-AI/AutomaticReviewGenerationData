[1] "An important question is the extent to which the features discovered in our previous work [39] and in the present study can be extended to other systems."
[2] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive."
[3] "The high energy required for forming an oxygen vacancy is one reason why oxides perform oxidation reactions at high temperature."
[4] "We expect that the dopant lowers the oxidation temperature by weakening the bond between the oxygen and the oxide."
[5] "In this scenario, doping improves the catalytic properties of the surface if it satisfies two conflicting requirements. On the one hand, it must weaken the bond of the oxygen atoms to the oxide surface to allow the oxidation of the gas-phase reactant;on the other hand, this weakening must not be so pronounced that the vacancy can not be healed by reaction with gas-phase oxygen."
[6] "The energy to form a vacancy (half the energy of a gas-phase O2 molecule, plus the energy of doped ceria with an oxygen vacancy, minus the energy of doped ceria) is 0.36 eV if the Ot,Au is removed and +0.56 eV if Ot,Ce is removed."
[7] "It is clear that thermodynamics favors vacancy formation in doped ceria."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by allowing a surface oxygen atom to react with a gas-phase reducing agent, forming an oxidation product and an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide is more prone to forming vacancies, enhancing its catalytic activity. This mechanism is significant because it reduces the activation energy needed for the oxidation process, making it more efficient at lower temperatures. By weakening the bond between the oxide and oxygen atoms, dopants facilitate the oxidation of gas-phase reactants while ensuring that the vacancies can still be healed by gas-phase oxygen, balancing the two conflicting requirements.

火星-范-克里威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过允许表面氧原子与气相还原剂反应，形成氧化产物和表面空位来运作。氧气空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对于氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物更易于形成空位，从而增强其催化活性。这种机制的意义在于降低了氧化过程的活化能，使其在较低温度下更加有效。通过削弱氧化物与氧原子之间的键，掺杂剂促进了气相反应物的氧化，同时确保空位仍然可以通过气相氧得到修复，平衡了两个相互冲突的要求。
