[1] "An important question is the extent to which the features discovered in our previous work [39] and in the present study can be extended to other systems."
[2] "Although extrapolating chemical behavior is not a safe endeavor, we wish to emphasize several features that may be general."
[3] "We find that doped oxides catalyze oxidation through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The dopant weakens the bond between the oxide and the oxygen atoms at its surface, making them more reactive."
[4] "In an oxidation reaction, the compound being oxidized takes an oxygen atom from the surface and creates an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase O2 adsorbs on the vacancy and is activated by the electron-rich environment that it finds there."
[5] "One atom in this activated O2 oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, and the other heals the oxy- gen vacancy in the surface."
[6] "The oxygen atom activated by the presence of the dopant also might initiate a dehydrogenation reaction by taking a hydrogen atom from a gas-phase molecule to form a hydroxyl."
[7] "The energy to form a vacancy (half the energy of a gas-phase O2 molecule, plus the energy of doped ceria with an oxygen vacancy, minus the en- ergy of doped ceria) is 0.36 eV if the Ot,Au is removed and +0.56 eV if Ot,Ce is removed."
[8] "The energy of forming an oxygen vacancy in undoped CeO2 is +3.01 eV. It is clear that thermodynamics favors vacancy formation in doped ceria."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the compound being oxidized taking an oxygen atom from the oxide surface to create an oxygen vacancy. Gas-phase oxygen then adsorbs onto this vacancy, becoming activated by the electron-rich environment. One oxygen atom in this activated state oxidizes a gas-phase molecule, while the other heals the oxygen vacancy. The dopant in the oxide surface weakens the bond between the oxide and oxygen atoms, making them more reactive. This leads to a reduction in the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, indicating improved catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及被氧化物从氧化物表面获取一个氧原子以形成氧空位。气相氧气随后吸附到这个空位上，通过其丰富的电子环境得到激活。其中一个氧原子利用这种激活状态氧化气相分子，而另一个则修复了表面的氧空位。掺杂剂使氧化物和氧原子之间的键变弱，使得氧原子更加活跃。这导致形成氧空位所需的能量降低，表明了催化剂活性和氧化能力的提升。
