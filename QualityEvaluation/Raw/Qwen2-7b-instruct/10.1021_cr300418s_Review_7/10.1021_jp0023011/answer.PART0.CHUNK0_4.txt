1. Oxygen defects, specifically oxygen vacancies and interstitial ions, are considered the source of oxygen storage capacity (OSC) in ceria-based catalyst supports. Preserving these defects is crucial for maintaining the OSC's stability against thermal aging.

2. In the case of ceria, the concentrations of oxygen interstitial ions and vacancies were found to be equal.

3. The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles for ceria-zirconia showed a distinct single reduction peak centered at 460 C, unlike the broader profile of ceria.

4. The oxygen defect concentration, including both oxygen vacancies and interstitial ions, dropped dramatically at temperatures ranging from 760 to 800 C. 

5. Despite a significant reduction in surface area, the amount of active oxygen in ceria-zirconia did not decrease appreciably.

1. 氧缺陷，特别是氧空位和间隙离子，被认为是氧化铈基催化剂支持材料中氧气存储容量（OSC）的来源。保持这些缺陷对于防止在热老化过程中OSC的稳定性至关重要。

2. 对于氧化铈，氧间隙离子和空位的浓度被发现相等。

3. 氧化铈-锆混合氧化物的温度程序还原（TPR）图谱显示了一个中心位于460°C的单一还原峰，与氧化铈的更宽峰不同。

4. 随着温度的增加，氧缺陷浓度（包括氧空位和间隙离子）急剧下降，从760到800摄氏度。

5. 尽管表面面积显著减少，但氧化铈-锆混合氧化物中的活性氧量并未明显减少。
