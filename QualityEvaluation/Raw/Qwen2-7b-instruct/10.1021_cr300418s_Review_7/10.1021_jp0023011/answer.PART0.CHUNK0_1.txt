<p>The surface area, on the other hand, exhibits much less correlation with OSC.</p>
<p>In ceria-zirconia, however, the difference between the concentration of vacancies and interstitial ions is as much as 8%.</p>
<p>As we suggested previously,6 the interstitial oxygen ions in ceria-containing compounds are likely to form during sample processing.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that this drop is not accompanied by a comparable decrease in the surface area, which decreases gradually with temperature.</p>
<p>Instead of gradual changing with increasing temperature as observed for the surface area and crystallite size, they both drop dramatically at 760 C in the ceria sample and remain unchanged in the ceria-zirconia sample.</p>

1. The surface area has a much lesser connection to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) compared to the concentration of oxygen defects.
2. In the ceria-zirconia mixture, there is a notable disparity between the concentration of vacancies and interstitial ions, reaching up to 8%.
3. Interstitial oxygen ions in ceria-based compounds tend to develop during the production process.
4. The decline in OSC in aged ceria samples doesn't correspond with a similar reduction in surface area, which merely decreases steadily with temperature.
5. The concentration of oxygen defects and the amount of active oxygen decrease abruptly at 760°C in pure ceria, contrasting with the stable condition in ceria-zirconia samples.

1. 表面积与氧气存储容量（OSC）之间的相关性远不如氧缺陷的浓度。
2. 在铈锆混合物中，空位浓度和间隙离子浓度之间的差异可达到8%。
3. 空隙氧离子在铈基化合物中通常在生产过程中形成。
4. 老化铈样品中的下降并不伴随相似的表面面积减少，仅随温度逐渐降低。
5. 在纯铈样品中，当温度升至760°C时，氧缺陷浓度和活性氧量急剧下降，而在铈锆样品中则保持不变。
