3.1. Neutron Diffraction and Rietveld Refinement. The temperature dependence of the neutron diffraction patterns for ceria and ceria-zirconia solid solution is shown in Figure 1. The data are presented as a function of the scattering vector Q, defined as Q = Q = 4πsinθ/λ and calculated from the neutron time-of-flight. The diffraction pattern for ceria exhibits peak shape change with increasing temperature due to crystallite size growth. On the other hand, the peak shape for ceria-zirconia remains virtually unchanged with increasing temperature indicating that the crystallite growth in ceria-zirconia is negligible even after a thermal treatment of 770 C. As one can see in Figure 2, the crystallite size determined by the peak width (=2π/FWHM) is approximately 80 Å in both samples as prepared, and for ceria after the thermal treatment it grows appreciably, while little growth is observed for ceria-zirconia.

3.2. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. The EPR spectra obtained from the as prepared samples at 77 K are presented in Figure 6 along with the DPPH calibration spectrum. The ceria as well as ceria-zirconia spectra show a line at g = 1.96, which has been assigned previously to impurity-related defects. The absence of other lines in the ceria spectrum suggests that the interstitial oxygen ions in octahedral sites are in the O2- state, and the corresponding vacancies constituting the Frenkel- type defects do not have any trapped electrons. Thus, neither vacancies nor interstitial ions contribute to EPR.

3.3. Temperature-Programmed Reduction. Figure 7 shows the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles for fresh and aged ceria as well as ceria-zirconia samples. As one can see, ceria exhibits a broad reduction profile with a low-temperature CO2 peak centered around 400 C and a high-temperature CO2 peak centered around 900 C. The area under the low-temperature peak is of particular interest since it relates to the low-temperature oxygen storage capacity of this material. The oxygen storage capacity measured up to 700 C is summarized in Table 1 along with the surface area of the samples.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the reactants to the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies (V_O) play a crucial role in this mechanism. The formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) requires energy, and this energy barrier influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the presence of oxygen vacancies allows for the adsorption of reactants, promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species, and facilitates the electron transfer necessary for the oxidation reaction to proceed. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the ease with which the vacancy can be created, thereby affecting the catalyst's ability to support the reaction. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can be more easily created and utilized in the catalytic process. Consequently, the stability and reactivity of the oxygen vacancies are key determinants of the overall catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进反应物中的电子向氧化物催化剂表面的转移而发挥作用。氧空位（V_O）在这一机制中起着关键作用。形成氧空位（ΔEv）需要能量，这一能量壁垒影响着氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。具体而言，氧空位的存在允许吸附反应物、促进活性氧物种的形成，并促进电子转移，这对于氧化反应的进行至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了其稳定性以及在催化剂过程中的利用程度。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更为稳定，更容易被创建并用于催化过程。因此，氧空位的稳定性和反应性是整体催化效率和氧化能力的关键决定因素。
