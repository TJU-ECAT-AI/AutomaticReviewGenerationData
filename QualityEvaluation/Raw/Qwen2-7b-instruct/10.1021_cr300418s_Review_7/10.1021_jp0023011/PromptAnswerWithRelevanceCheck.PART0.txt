<p>Recently, we have investigated the nature of these active oxygen species in pure ceria using pulsed neutron diffraction. Neutron diffraction is a more powerful tool for studying the oxygen positions in oxides than X-ray diffraction because of the better scattering contrast of oxygen compared to metal ions.</p>
<p>We have shown the presence of the vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel-type) oxygen defects in CeO2 by analyzing the pulsed neutron diffraction data both in the reciprocal space by the Rietveld refinement and in the real space by the atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) analysis. These defects were found to disappear following a high-temperature treatment of 1073 K (800 C).</p>
<p>In ceria-zirconia, however, the Rietveld analysis shows that the concentration of vacancies far exceeds that of interstitial ions, indicating substantial oxygen deficiency. Thus, in addition to vacancies originating from mere relocation of oxygen ions into the octahedral interstitial sites, there are some excessive vacancies that require the presence of Ce3+(4f1) cations in order to maintain electrical neutrality.</p>
<p>The temperature-dependent behavior of the oxygen defective structure differed dramatically between ceria and ceria-zirconia. In the former, the Frenkel-type defects annihilated at high temperature due to recombination of the interstitial ions with the vacancies, and after the completion of the thermal cycle only a small fraction of the defects was retained. In the latter, the concentrations of both oxygen vacancies and interstitial ions remained unchanged in the course of similar thermal treatment.</p>
<p>We speculate that because of the local atomic compressive stresses at the spatially tight tetrahedral sites in the ceria-zirconia caused by a smaller ionic radius of zirconium it is more difficult for the interstitial oxygen ions to reach the tetrahedral sites and recombine with vacancies.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the case of ceria and ceria-zirconia, the presence of oxygen defects, including oxygen vacancies and interstitial ions, affects their catalytic activity at moderate temperatures. The stability of these defects, particularly in ceria-zirconia, enhances the oxygen storage capacity and thermal stability compared to pure ceria. The mechanism acting at the atomic scale level contributes to the function of ceria-zirconia mixed oxides in automotive three-way catalytic converters.

<p>The surface area, on the other hand, exhibits much less correlation with OSC.</p>
<p>In ceria-zirconia, however, the difference between the concentration of vacancies and interstitial ions is as much as 8%.</p>
<p>As we suggested previously,6 the interstitial oxygen ions in ceria-containing compounds are likely to form during sample processing.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that this drop is not accompanied by a comparable decrease in the surface area, which decreases gradually with temperature.</p>
<p>Instead of gradual changing with increasing temperature as observed for the surface area and crystallite size, they both drop dramatically at 760 C in the ceria sample and remain unchanged in the ceria-zirconia sample.</p>

1. The surface area has a much lesser connection to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) compared to the concentration of oxygen defects.
2. In the ceria-zirconia mixture, there is a notable disparity between the concentration of vacancies and interstitial ions, reaching up to 8%.
3. Interstitial oxygen ions in ceria-based compounds tend to develop during the production process.

3.1. Neutron Diffraction and Rietveld Refinement. The temperature dependence of the neutron diffraction patterns for ceria and ceria-zirconia solid solution is shown in Figure 1. The data are presented as a function of the scattering vector Q, defined as Q = Q = 4πsinθ/λ and calculated from the neutron time-of-flight. The diffraction pattern for ceria exhibits peak shape change with increasing temperature due to crystallite size growth. On the other hand, the peak shape for ceria-zirconia remains virtually unchanged with increasing temperature indicating that the crystallite growth in ceria-zirconia is negligible even after a thermal treatment of 770 C. As one can see in Figure 2, the crystallite size determined by the peak width (=2π/FWHM) is approximately 80 Å in both samples as prepared, and for ceria after the thermal treatment it grows appreciably, while little growth is observed for ceria-zirconia.

3.2. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance. The EPR spectra obtained from the as prepared samples at 77 K are presented in Figure 6 along with the DPPH calibration spectrum. The ceria as well as ceria-zirconia spectra show a line at g = 1.96, which has been assigned previously to impurity-related defects. The absence of other lines in the ceria spectrum suggests that the interstitial oxygen ions in octahedral sites are in the O2- state, and the corresponding vacancies constituting the Frenkel- type defects do not have any trapped electrons. Thus, neither vacancies nor interstitial ions contribute to EPR.

3.3. Temperature-Programmed Reduction. Figure 7 shows the temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles for fresh and aged ceria as well as ceria-zirconia samples. As one can see, ceria exhibits a broad reduction profile with a low-temperature CO2 peak centered around 400 C and a high-temperature CO2 peak centered around 900 C. The area under the low-temperature peak is of particular interest since it relates to the low-temperature oxygen storage capacity of this material. The oxygen storage capacity measured up to 700 C is summarized in Table 1 along with the surface area of the samples.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the reactants to the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies (V_O) play a crucial role in this mechanism. The formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) requires energy, and this energy barrier influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the presence of oxygen vacancies allows for the adsorption of reactants, promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species, and facilitates the electron transfer necessary for the oxidation reaction to proceed. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the ease with which the vacancy can be created, thereby affecting the catalyst's ability to support the reaction. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can be more easily created and utilized in the catalytic process. Consequently, the stability and reactivity of the oxygen vacancies are key determinants of the overall catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进反应物中的电子向氧化物催化剂表面的转移而发挥作用。氧空位（V_O）在这一机制中起着关键作用。形成氧空位（ΔEv）需要能量，这一能量壁垒影响着氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。具体而言，氧空位的存在允许吸附反应物、促进活性氧物种的形成，并促进电子转移，这对于氧化反应的进行至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了其稳定性以及在催化剂过程中的利用程度。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更为稳定，更容易被创建并用于催化过程。因此，氧空位的稳定性和反应性是整体催化效率和氧化能力的关键决定因素。

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide, which then leads to the activation of oxygen and facilitates the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as it signifies easier formation of oxygen vacancies that can then participate in the oxidation reaction more efficiently.

2. In pure ceria, the effectiveness of the material is influenced by factors other than just surface area. Weakly bound oxygen species are present and likely undergo rapid exchange with the environment, contributing to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC).

3. Pulsed neutron diffraction techniques were utilized to identify the presence of vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel-type) oxygen defects in ceria. These defects were detected through analysis in both reciprocal and real spaces.

4. In ceria-zirconia, the oxygen deficiency is significantly greater, with the concentration of oxygen vacancies exceeding that of interstitial ions. This substantial oxygen deficiency is intrinsic to ceria-zirconia solid solutions.

5. Oxygen defects, including both vacancies and interstitial ions, are present in both pure ceria nano-crystals and in nano-crystalline solid solutions of ceria and zirconia.

6. The temperature dependence of defect concentration varies markedly between ceria and ceria-zirconia. In ceria, the concentrations of vacancies and interstitial ions drop dramatically upon high-temperature treatment, whereas these concentrations remain stable in ceria-zirconia.

1. 马斯-范克雷文机制涉及在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv），这随后促进了氧化反应。氧空位形成的能量需求（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为这意味着更容易形成氧空位，从而更有效地参与氧化反应。

2. 对于纯铈，材料的有效性不仅仅取决于表面积。存在弱结合的氧物种，并且可能以快速与环境交换的方式参与，从而贡献到氧存储容量（OSC）。

3. 利用脉冲中子衍射技术来识别铈中的空位-间隙（弗伦克尔类型）氧缺陷。这些缺陷通过在倒易空间和真实空间的分析被检测出来。

4. 在铈锆中，氧缺乏显著更大，氧空位的浓度远超过间隙离子。这种显著的氧缺乏是铈锆固溶体的内在属性。

5. 氧缺陷，包括空位和间隙离子，存在于纯铈纳米晶体以及铈和锆的纳米结晶固体溶液中。

6. 缺陷浓度的温度依赖性在铈和铈锆之间存在显著差异。在铈中，高温度处理后空位和间隙离子的浓度急剧下降，而在铈锆中这些浓度保持稳定。
