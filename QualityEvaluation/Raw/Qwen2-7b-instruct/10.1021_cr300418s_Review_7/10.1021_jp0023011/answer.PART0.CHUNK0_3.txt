[1] "Recent experimental observations on pure ceria suggest that the surface area may not be the only parameter that determines the effectiveness of ceria."
[2] "It is likely that these weakly bound oxygen species undergo fast exchange with the environment and provide OSC."
[3] "We have shown the presence of the vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel-type) oxygen defects in CeO2 by analyzing the pulsed neutron diffraction data both in the reciprocal space by the Rietveld refinement and in the real space by the atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) analysis."
[4] "In ceria-zirconia, however, the Rietveld analysis shows that the concentration of vacancies far exceeds that of interstitial ions, indicating substantial oxygen deficiency."
[5] "The presence of oxygen vacancies and interstitial ions in pure ceria nano-crystals and in a nano-crystalline solid solution of ceria and zirconia."
[6] "The difference in the temperature dependence of defect concentration in ceria and ceria-zirconia is quite striking. While ceria exhibits a dramatic drop in the concentrations of vacancies and interstitial ions following high temperature treatment, these concentrations remain virtually constant in ceria-zirconia."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide, which then leads to the activation of oxygen and facilitates the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as it signifies easier formation of oxygen vacancies that can then participate in the oxidation reaction more efficiently.

2. In pure ceria, the effectiveness of the material is influenced by factors other than just surface area. Weakly bound oxygen species are present and likely undergo rapid exchange with the environment, contributing to the oxygen storage capacity (OSC).

3. Pulsed neutron diffraction techniques were utilized to identify the presence of vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel-type) oxygen defects in ceria. These defects were detected through analysis in both reciprocal and real spaces.

4. In ceria-zirconia, the oxygen deficiency is significantly greater, with the concentration of oxygen vacancies exceeding that of interstitial ions. This substantial oxygen deficiency is intrinsic to ceria-zirconia solid solutions.

5. Oxygen defects, including both vacancies and interstitial ions, are present in both pure ceria nano-crystals and in nano-crystalline solid solutions of ceria and zirconia.

6. The temperature dependence of defect concentration varies markedly between ceria and ceria-zirconia. In ceria, the concentrations of vacancies and interstitial ions drop dramatically upon high-temperature treatment, whereas these concentrations remain stable in ceria-zirconia.

1. 马斯-范克雷文机制涉及在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv），这随后促进了氧化反应。氧空位形成的能量需求（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为这意味着更容易形成氧空位，从而更有效地参与氧化反应。

2. 对于纯铈，材料的有效性不仅仅取决于表面积。存在弱结合的氧物种，并且可能以快速与环境交换的方式参与，从而贡献到氧存储容量（OSC）。

3. 利用脉冲中子衍射技术来识别铈中的空位-间隙（弗伦克尔类型）氧缺陷。这些缺陷通过在倒易空间和真实空间的分析被检测出来。

4. 在铈锆中，氧缺乏显著更大，氧空位的浓度远超过间隙离子。这种显著的氧缺乏是铈锆固溶体的内在属性。

5. 氧缺陷，包括空位和间隙离子，存在于纯铈纳米晶体以及铈和锆的纳米结晶固体溶液中。

6. 缺陷浓度的温度依赖性在铈和铈锆之间存在显著差异。在铈中，高温度处理后空位和间隙离子的浓度急剧下降，而在铈锆中这些浓度保持稳定。
