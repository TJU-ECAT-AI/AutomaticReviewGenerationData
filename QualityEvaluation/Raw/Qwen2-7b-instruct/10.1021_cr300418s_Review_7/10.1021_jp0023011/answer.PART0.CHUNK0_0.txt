<p>Recently, we have investigated the nature of these active oxygen species in pure ceria using pulsed neutron diffraction. Neutron diffraction is a more powerful tool for studying the oxygen positions in oxides than X-ray diffraction because of the better scattering contrast of oxygen compared to metal ions.</p>
<p>We have shown the presence of the vacancy-interstitial (Frenkel-type) oxygen defects in CeO2 by analyzing the pulsed neutron diffraction data both in the reciprocal space by the Rietveld refinement and in the real space by the atomic pair-distribution function (PDF) analysis. These defects were found to disappear following a high-temperature treatment of 1073 K (800 C).</p>
<p>In ceria-zirconia, however, the Rietveld analysis shows that the concentration of vacancies far exceeds that of interstitial ions, indicating substantial oxygen deficiency. Thus, in addition to vacancies originating from mere relocation of oxygen ions into the octahedral interstitial sites, there are some excessive vacancies that require the presence of Ce3+(4f1) cations in order to maintain electrical neutrality.</p>
<p>The temperature-dependent behavior of the oxygen defective structure differed dramatically between ceria and ceria-zirconia. In the former, the Frenkel-type defects annihilated at high temperature due to recombination of the interstitial ions with the vacancies, and after the completion of the thermal cycle only a small fraction of the defects was retained. In the latter, the concentrations of both oxygen vacancies and interstitial ions remained unchanged in the course of similar thermal treatment.</p>
<p>We speculate that because of the local atomic compressive stresses at the spatially tight tetrahedral sites in the ceria-zirconia caused by a smaller ionic radius of zirconium it is more difficult for the interstitial oxygen ions to reach the tetrahedral sites and recombine with vacancies.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the case of ceria and ceria-zirconia, the presence of oxygen defects, including oxygen vacancies and interstitial ions, affects their catalytic activity at moderate temperatures. The stability of these defects, particularly in ceria-zirconia, enhances the oxygen storage capacity and thermal stability compared to pure ceria. The mechanism acting at the atomic scale level contributes to the function of ceria-zirconia mixed oxides in automotive three-way catalytic converters.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位（ΔEv）的形成发挥作用。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。对于氧化铈和氧化锆混合氧化物，表面的氧缺陷，包括氧空位和间隙离子的存在影响其在中等温度下的催化活性。在氧化铈和氧化锆混合氧化物中，氧缺陷的稳定性增强，提高了氧气存储能力和热稳定性，与纯氧化铈相比。原子尺度机制对汽车三元催化转化器中的氧化铈混合氧化物的功能起着重要作用。
