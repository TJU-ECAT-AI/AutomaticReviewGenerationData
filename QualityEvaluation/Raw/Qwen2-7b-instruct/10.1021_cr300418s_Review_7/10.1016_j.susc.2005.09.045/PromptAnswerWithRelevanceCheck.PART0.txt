<p>The formation and behavior of O vacancies in CeO2 bulk and surface have been modeled using periodic plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) [1015] and static [3,4] and dynamic [7] force-field methods. The force-field calculations suggest that the O vacancy is more stable at the surface than in the bulk [3,4]. This is partly supported by the periodic DFT calculations [10],where, as mentioned above, surface vacancies were found to be more stable at the more open (110) surface than at the denser (111) surface, but Ref. [10] also indicates that, for the (111) surface, O vacancies in the sub-surface layer are the most stable.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancies as active sites for the oxidation process. Oxygen vacancies act as Lewis acids, attracting and oxidizing molecules like carbon monoxide (CO) or sulfur dioxide (SO2). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen vacancy is more stable, making it easier for the surface to form vacancies and thus increasing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the oxygen vacancy is less stable, potentially reducing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing capability of the surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of oxide catalysts to enhance the efficiency of oxidation reactions. Oxygen vacancies create additional active sites on the surface, facilitating the adsorption and activation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv), which is approximately 3.1 to 3.3 electron volts in the present study, plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to enhanced catalytic performance and greater oxidizing ability of the surface.

The localized nature of the excess electron density near the oxygen vacancy, as observed in the present study and supported by previous DFT+U calculations, contrasts with the delocalized picture proposed in earlier research. This localization suggests that the electrons are not spread out across the surface but are instead confined to specific sites, particularly around the two nearest Ce ions. This finding aligns with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, as it implies that the oxygen vacancy creates discrete active sites that are crucial for the efficient oxidation of molecules.

The electronic density of states (DOS) calculations further support the conclusion that oxygen vacancies lead to the appearance of new states in the bandgap of the oxide. These states, which are occupied by the excess electrons, contribute to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface by providing additional pathways for electron transfer and chemical reactions. The positions of these states differ between the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) and restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) methods, with the ROHF method showing better agreement with experimental XPS and UPS results.

In summary, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, the localized nature of the excess electron density, and the appearance of new states in the bandgap are all critical factors in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces according to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The present study supports these concepts by demonstrating the formation of oxygen vacancies on the CeO2(110) surface and examining the resulting electronic structure and properties.

火星-克雷威尔机制通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位来增强氧化反应的效率。氧空位在表面上产生额外的活性位点，从而促进反应物的吸附和活化。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv），在本研究中约为3.1到3.3电子伏特，对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常意味着氧空位更有利于形成，导致更高的催化性能和更大的表面氧化能力。

当前研究中观察到的氧空位附近局部化的多余电子密度，与早期研究提出的分散化图景形成了对比，并且得到了之前DFT+U计算的支持。这一局部化表明，电子并不是在整个表面扩散，而是被限制在特定位置，尤其是靠近两个最近的铈离子的区域。这与火星-克雷威尔机制相吻合，因为它暗示氧空位创造了离散的活性位点，这些位点对于高效氧化分子至关重要。

电子密度态（DOS）计算进一步支持了结论，即氧空位导致氧化物带隙中出现新的状态。这些由多余电子占据的状态增加了表面的催化活性和氧化能力，为电子转移和化学反应提供了额外途径。UHF和ROHF方法中状态的位置存在差异，其中ROHF方法与实验XPS和UPS结果的比较显示更好的一致性。

综上所述，根据火星-克雷威尔机制，形成氧空位所需的能量、局部化的多余电子密度以及带隙中出现的新状态都是确定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。当前研究通过研究CeO2(110)表面的氧空位形成及其引起的电子结构和性质，支持了这些概念。

[3] "However, we find that, for wavefunction-based methods (HF and MP2), the spin-polarized density of the relaxed vacancy is completely dominated by the features at the two Ce ions next to the vacancy.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactants. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines how readily these vacancies can be created, impacting the reaction rate and efficiency.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its effect on the stability and availability of oxygen vacancies. Lower ΔEv values mean that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, potentially increasing the surface area for reactions and enhancing the catalyst's performance. Conversely, higher ΔEv values can limit the formation of these vacancies, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness.

3. In the context of ceria (CeO2), the delocalized electronic structure reported by Yang et al. in periodic DFT calculations might be attributed to self-interaction errors in the DFT approach. Wavefunction-based methods like Hartree-Fock (HF) and many-body perturbation theory (MP2) predict a complete localization of excess electrons on the two Ce ions near the vacancy, aligning with DFT+U results for partially reduced bulk ceria and CeO2(001) surfaces. This finding suggests that the delocalized structure reported by Yang et al. could be an artifact of DFT limitations rather than a physical reality.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过促进氧化物表面的氧向反应物的转移来发挥作用。氧空位在增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了这些空位的生成效率，进而影响反应速率和效率。

2. ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时的重要性在于它对氧空位稳定性和可用性的影响。较低的ΔEv值意味着氧空位更容易形成，可能增加表面面积，提高催化剂性能。相反，较高的ΔEv值可以限制氧空位的形成，降低催化剂的有效性。

3. 对于铈氧化物（CeO2），杨等人在周期性密度泛函理论（DFT）计算中报告的全局电子结构可能是DFT方法局限性的产物。基于波函数的方法，如哈特里-福克（HF）和多体扰动理论（MP2），预测在真空附近两个铈离子的完全局部化多余的电子密度。这与部分还原的块体铈氧化物和CeO2(001)表面的DFT+U结果相一致。这一发现表明，杨等人报告的全局结构可能是DFT局限性的产物，而不是物理现实。
