[1] "The formation and behavior of O vacancies in CeO2 bulk and surface have been modeled using periodic plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) [1015] and static [3,4] and dynamic [7] force-field methods."
[2] "The force-field calculations suggest that the O vacancy is more stable at the surface than in the bulk [3,4]."
[3] "The theoretically observed surface relaxation induced by the O vacancy thus involves the O ion nearby moving closer to the vacancy, which suggests that the electrons are not trapped in the vacancy, as in the case of the MgO(001) surface [16]."
[4] "Furthermore, these calculations indicated only a minor effect of spin polarization, where a parallel ordering of small magnetic moments (0.2 lB on each Ce ion) was found to be slightly preferred energetically."
[5] "The authors showed that the delocalized state is a local minimum of the electronic structure, and that there exists a localized state at a lower energy."
[6] "However, the chemistry of oxygen vacancies in ceria is gradually becoming more well understood, clearly favoring a localized description of the f-electrons for partially reduced ceria."
[7] "The vacancy formation energy (3.1
3.3 eV at the MP2 level including basis set superposition error (BSSE) correction) and a geometric structure in qualitative agreement with the periodic DFT results, where the surface O ion next to the vacancy assumes a bridging position between the reduced Ce ions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of oxide catalysts to enhance the efficiency of oxidation reactions. Oxygen vacancies create additional active sites on the surface, facilitating the adsorption and activation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv), which is approximately 3.1 to 3.3 electron volts in the present study, plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to enhanced catalytic performance and greater oxidizing ability of the surface.

The localized nature of the excess electron density near the oxygen vacancy, as observed in the present study and supported by previous DFT+U calculations, contrasts with the delocalized picture proposed in earlier research. This localization suggests that the electrons are not spread out across the surface but are instead confined to specific sites, particularly around the two nearest Ce ions. This finding aligns with the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, as it implies that the oxygen vacancy creates discrete active sites that are crucial for the efficient oxidation of molecules.

The electronic density of states (DOS) calculations further support the conclusion that oxygen vacancies lead to the appearance of new states in the bandgap of the oxide. These states, which are occupied by the excess electrons, contribute to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface by providing additional pathways for electron transfer and chemical reactions. The positions of these states differ between the unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) and restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) methods, with the ROHF method showing better agreement with experimental XPS and UPS results.

In summary, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, the localized nature of the excess electron density, and the appearance of new states in the bandgap are all critical factors in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces according to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The present study supports these concepts by demonstrating the formation of oxygen vacancies on the CeO2(110) surface and examining the resulting electronic structure and properties.

火星-克雷威尔机制通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位来增强氧化反应的效率。氧空位在表面上产生额外的活性位点，从而促进反应物的吸附和活化。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv），在本研究中约为3.1到3.3电子伏特，对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常意味着氧空位更有利于形成，导致更高的催化性能和更大的表面氧化能力。

当前研究中观察到的氧空位附近局部化的多余电子密度，与早期研究提出的分散化图景形成了对比，并且得到了之前DFT+U计算的支持。这一局部化表明，电子并不是在整个表面扩散，而是被限制在特定位置，尤其是靠近两个最近的铈离子的区域。这与火星-克雷威尔机制相吻合，因为它暗示氧空位创造了离散的活性位点，这些位点对于高效氧化分子至关重要。

电子密度态（DOS）计算进一步支持了结论，即氧空位导致氧化物带隙中出现新的状态。这些由多余电子占据的状态增加了表面的催化活性和氧化能力，为电子转移和化学反应提供了额外途径。UHF和ROHF方法中状态的位置存在差异，其中ROHF方法与实验XPS和UPS结果的比较显示更好的一致性。

综上所述，根据火星-克雷威尔机制，形成氧空位所需的能量、局部化的多余电子密度以及带隙中出现的新状态都是确定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。当前研究通过研究CeO2(110)表面的氧空位形成及其引起的电子结构和性质，支持了这些概念。
