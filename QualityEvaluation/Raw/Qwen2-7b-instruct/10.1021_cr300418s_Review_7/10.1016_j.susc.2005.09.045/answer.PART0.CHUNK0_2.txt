[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by involving the adsorption of reactants on the surface of the oxide catalyst, followed by a reaction with oxygen vacancies, leading to the formation of products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the adsorption of reactants onto the surface of an oxide catalyst, followed by a reaction with oxygen vacancies. This leads to the formation of products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to more readily available oxygen vacancies for the reaction.

马斯-范克雷文机制通过吸附反应物到氧化物催化剂表面，随后与氧空位反应，产生产物来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为可以更方便地利用氧空位进行反应。
