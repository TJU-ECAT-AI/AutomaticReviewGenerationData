<p>The formation and behavior of O vacancies in CeO2 bulk and surface have been modeled using periodic plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) [1015] and static [3,4] and dynamic [7] force-field methods. The force-field calculations suggest that the O vacancy is more stable at the surface than in the bulk [3,4]. This is partly supported by the periodic DFT calculations [10],where, as mentioned above, surface vacancies were found to be more stable at the more open (110) surface than at the denser (111) surface, but Ref. [10] also indicates that, for the (111) surface, O vacancies in the sub-surface layer are the most stable.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancies as active sites for the oxidation process. Oxygen vacancies act as Lewis acids, attracting and oxidizing molecules like carbon monoxide (CO) or sulfur dioxide (SO2). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen vacancy is more stable, making it easier for the surface to form vacancies and thus increasing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests that the oxygen vacancy is less stable, potentially reducing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing capability of the surface.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为氧化过程的活性位点来运作。氧空位作为路易斯酸，吸引并氧化如一氧化碳或二氧化硫这样的分子。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更稳定，使表面更容易形成空位，从而增加催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv表明氧空位较不稳定，可能降低表面的催化效率和氧化能力。
