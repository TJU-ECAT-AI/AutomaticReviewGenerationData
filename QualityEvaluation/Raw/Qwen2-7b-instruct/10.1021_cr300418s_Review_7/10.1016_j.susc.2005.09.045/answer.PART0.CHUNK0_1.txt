1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy barrier is crucial for the activation of the reactants and the subsequent formation of products.

2. The study employed ab initio electronic structure calculations to investigate the oxygen vacancy formation on the CeO2(110) surface. Periodic plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) and force-field methods were also utilized for modeling the formation and behavior of oxygen vacancies in CeO2 bulk and surface.

3. The delocalized state in the electronic structure is identified as a local minimum, with a localized state existing at a lower energy, according to the research findings.

4. The discrepancies between the UHF and ROHF results regarding the vacancy formation energy (Ered) and the electronic density of states (DOS) can be attributed to the use of the ROHF solution as an initial wavefunction in an UHF calculation.

5. The calculated vacancy formation energy (3.13.3 eV) and the relaxed geometry around the oxygen vacancy align with periodic DFT results for the CeO2(110) surface.

6. The bridging oxygen structure, where the oxygen ion adjacent to the vacancy relocates halfway toward the vacancy between neighboring surface Ce ions, can be explained through simple symmetry arguments.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作原理是通过氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这个能垒对于激活反应物和后续生成产物至关重要。

2. 研究使用了原位电子结构计算方法来研究CeO2(110)表面上的氧空位形成情况。周期平面波密度泛函理论（DFT）和力场方法也被用于模拟CeO2本体和表面中氧空位的形成与行为。

3. 根据研究结果，电子结构中的离域状态被识别为一个局部最小值，而存在一个位于更低能量的局部状态。

4. UHF和ROHF结果之间的差异，特别是关于氧空位形成能（Ered）和电子密度态（DOS），可以通过将ROHF解用作UHF计算的初始波函数来进行解释。
