[1] "The formation and behavior of O vacancies in CeO2 bulk and surface have been modeled using periodic plane-wave density functional theory (DFT) [1015] and static [3,4] and dynamic [7] force-field methods. The force-field calculations suggest that the O vacancy is more stable at the surface than in the bulk [3,4]."
[2] "Furthermore, there are reports of CO oxidation by CeO2 surface oxygen and the simultaneous reduction of
SO2
by CeO2 oxygen vacancies in the reaction 2CO + SO2 ! 2CO2 + S [2], showing that ceria itself takes an active part in the removal of harmful exhaust gases and that the catalytic importance of the redox behavior of ceria extends further than the OSC."
[3] "However, we find that, for wavefunction-based methods (HF and MP2), the spin-polarized density of the relaxed vacancy is completely dominated by the features at the two Ce ions next to the vacancy. From a population analysis, it is also clear that the excess a-electron density is described almost exclusively by the f-functions of these two reduced Ce ions."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactants. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines how readily these vacancies can be created, impacting the reaction rate and efficiency.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its effect on the stability and availability of oxygen vacancies. Lower ΔEv values mean that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, potentially increasing the surface area for reactions and enhancing the catalyst's performance. Conversely, higher ΔEv values can limit the formation of these vacancies, reducing the catalyst's effectiveness.

3. In the context of ceria (CeO2), the delocalized electronic structure reported by Yang et al. in periodic DFT calculations might be attributed to self-interaction errors in the DFT approach. Wavefunction-based methods like Hartree-Fock (HF) and many-body perturbation theory (MP2) predict a complete localization of excess electrons on the two Ce ions near the vacancy, aligning with DFT+U results for partially reduced bulk ceria and CeO2(001) surfaces. This finding suggests that the delocalized structure reported by Yang et al. could be an artifact of DFT limitations rather than a physical reality.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过促进氧化物表面的氧向反应物的转移来发挥作用。氧空位在增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了这些空位的生成效率，进而影响反应速率和效率。

2. ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时的重要性在于它对氧空位稳定性和可用性的影响。较低的ΔEv值意味着氧空位更容易形成，可能增加表面面积，提高催化剂性能。相反，较高的ΔEv值可以限制氧空位的形成，降低催化剂的有效性。

3. 对于铈氧化物（CeO2），杨等人在周期性密度泛函理论（DFT）计算中报告的全局电子结构可能是DFT方法局限性的产物。基于波函数的方法，如哈特里-福克（HF）和多体扰动理论（MP2），预测在真空附近两个铈离子的完全局部化多余的电子密度。这与部分还原的块体铈氧化物和CeO2(001)表面的DFT+U结果相一致。这一发现表明，杨等人报告的全局结构可能是DFT局限性的产物，而不是物理现实。
