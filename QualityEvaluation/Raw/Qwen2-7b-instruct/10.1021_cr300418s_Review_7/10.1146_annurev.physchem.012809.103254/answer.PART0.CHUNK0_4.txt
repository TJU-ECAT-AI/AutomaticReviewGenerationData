[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancy as a reactive site for the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
