[1] "In lockstep with these experimental advances, computational approaches have been developed, in particular first-principles calculations based on density functional theory."
[2] "The invention of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and its offspring, atomic force microscopy, has especially broadened the reach of the field."
[3] "For example, water dissociates at the vacancies, resulting in two hydroxyls (3742) as shown schematically in Figure 3a."
[4] "There are strong indications that a (1×1) terminated ZnO(0001)-O surface is fully covered with hydrogen (7, 21)."
[5] "The anatase polymorph of TiO2 is also a promising subject for further surface investigations (61)."
[6] "Often, these are then synthesized as ultrathin films, i.e., with a thickness of a few atomic layers."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values make it easier for oxygen to be adsorbed and desorbed from the surface, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface. This process facilitates the breaking of the O-H bond in water molecules, allowing for the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which are crucial in various oxidation reactions. The stability and mobility of these oxygen vacancies on the surface play a critical role in determining the efficiency of the catalytic process.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义，因为它影响着表面的催化能力和氧化性。较低的ΔEv值使氧气更容易吸附和脱附于表面，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一过程有助于水分子中O-H键的断裂，从而促进氢氧基自由基的形成，这对各种氧化反应至关重要。表面氧空位的稳定性和流动性在确定催化过程效率方面起着关键作用。
