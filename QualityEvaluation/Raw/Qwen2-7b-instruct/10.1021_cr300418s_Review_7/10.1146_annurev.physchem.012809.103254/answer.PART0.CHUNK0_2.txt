[1] "During the past 15 years or so, there has been a shift in the type of systems that surface scientists have investigated: Whereas the initial focus was predominantly on metals and semiconductors, there is a growing body of work that deals with metal-oxide surfaces, the topic of this review."
[2] "Understanding the surface properties of oxides—their geometric and electronic structure, their reaction with adsorbed entities such as molecules or nanoparticles, and the formation of interfaces—is of key interest in many technological areas."
[3] "It has been recognized early on that defects determine much of the interesting properties of oxide surfaces."
[4] "STM, as a probe for local electronic structure, is an ideal tool for investigating surface defects."
[5] "For example, water dissociates at the vacancies, resulting in two hydroxyls (3742) as shown schematically in Figure 3a."
[6] "It seems quite straightforward to interpret the gap state as coming from O vacancies and hydroxyls on the clean and water-dosed surface, respectively."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (O vac) on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies can form when oxygen atoms are removed from the surface, creating sites where oxygen atoms can later bind. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv indicates that more energy is needed to create oxygen vacancies, which might reduce the surface's catalytic activity. However, the presence of oxygen vacancies can enhance the oxidation of certain molecules, acting as active sites for reactions. Therefore, the balance between ΔEv and the ability to form and utilize oxygen vacancies is crucial for optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位（O vac）起作用。当氧原子从表面移除时，会形成氧原子可以随后结合的站点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较高的ΔEv意味着需要更多的能量来创建氧空位，这可能降低表面的催化活性。然而，氧空位的存在可以增强某些分子的氧化，作为反应的活性位点。因此，ΔEv与形成并利用氧空位的能力之间的平衡对于优化氧化催化剂在氧化反应中的性能至关重要。
