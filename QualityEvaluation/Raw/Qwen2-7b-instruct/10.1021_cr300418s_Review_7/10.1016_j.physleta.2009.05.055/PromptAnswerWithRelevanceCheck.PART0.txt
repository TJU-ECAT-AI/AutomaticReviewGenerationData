[1] "It is known that the ceria (111) surface is the most stable surface and has been studied extensively, including a recent paper by David Kings group which studied the vacancy clusters on the (111) surface."
[2] "For some of the other oxygen vacancy pairs examined, the electron localization is clearly different from the sum of two isolated va- cansies, and often involves the creation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer."
[3] "In the DFT + U method,a Hubbard parameter, U, is introduced for the Ce4 f electrons to describe the on-site Coulomb interaction; this helps to remove the self-interaction error and improves the description of correlation effects."
[4] "By substituting (2) and (3) into (1), we can write Epairing as Epairing = E(vi, v j) 2E(v) + E(CeO2)."
[5] "The fully relaxed atomic structure is displayed in Fig. 4(a). Only the top view with the distribution of the excess electrons (which will be discussed later) is shown."
[6] "It is found that the P15 oxygen vacancy pair structure on the ceria (110) surface is the most favor- able."
[7] "For the most stable oxygen vacancy pair pattern (the P15 pattern), extra electron localization is found on four neighboring Ce4+ ions, which are reduced to Ce3+."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. This energy is crucial as it influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

2. In the context of the study, the ΔEv plays a significant role in determining the stability and formation of oxygen vacancy pairs on the ceria surface. The next nearest neighbor pattern (P15) was found to be the most favorable configuration for these pairs due to its unique balance between structural and electronic adaptations.

3. Structural adaptation involves the excess electrons localizing closer to the vacancies, whereas electronic adaptation encourages the excess electrons to depart as far as possible. This balance determines the final geometrical structure of the oxygen vacancy pairs.

4. The electronic properties of the oxygen vacancy pairs were analyzed through density of states and charge density analyses. For the most stable configuration (P15), the extra electrons are localized on four neighboring Ce4+ ions, which are reduced to Ce3+. This localization differs from the sum of two isolated vacancies, often involving the creation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer for other configurations.

5. The ΔEv is essential for understanding the dissociation mechanism of NO molecules on ceria. It influences the formation of oxygen vacancy pairs and the subsequent interactions between NO molecules and the surface Ce3+ ions. The study suggests that factors such as doping with metal atoms might be needed to enhance the formation of nearest neighbor vacancy pairs or clusters.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。这一能量对催化剂活性和氧化能力具有重要影响。

2. 在研究中，ΔEv对于确定铈表面氧空位对的稳定性和形成至关重要。发现最有利的氧空位对配置为最近邻邻居模式（即P15模式），由于其独特的结构适应性和电子适应性平衡，这成为最有利的配置。

3. 结构适应性涉及多余的电子局部化在更接近空位的位置，而电子适应性鼓励多余的电子尽可能地远离。这种平衡决定了氧空位对的最终几何结构。

4. 通过密度状态和电荷密度分析研究了氧空位对的电子性质。在最稳定的配置（P15）中，额外的电子局部化在四个相邻的Ce4+离子上，这些离子被还原为Ce3+。这一局部化与两个孤立空位之和不同，其他配置往往涉及到第二原子层中Ce3+离子的创建。

5. ΔEv对于理解NO分子在铈上的分解机制至关重要。它影响氧空位对的形成以及随后NO分子与表面Ce3+离子之间的相互作用。研究建议，向铈掺杂金属原子可能需要增强最近邻氧空位对或簇的形成。

[1] "Daturi et al. [10] have proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on ceria whereby two NO molecules adsorbed on neighboring oxygen vacancies react to give dinitrogen."
[2] "We found that the most stable configuration of an oxygen vacancy pair on the ceria (110) is the P15 pattern (the next nearest neighboring pair) instead of the nearest neighboring pairs."
[3] "The adsorbed NO molecules bind with the surface Ce3+ ions neighboring the vacan- cies through their both ends and the NO bonds are stretched by about 0.1 Å as compared with the calculated value for the free NO."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism suggests that in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, two NO molecules adsorbed on neighboring oxygen vacancies react to form dinitrogen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In this study, it was found that the most stable oxygen vacancy pair configuration on the ceria (110) surface is the next nearest neighbor pattern (P15). When two NO molecules adsorb on this oxygen vacancy pair, they bind with the surface Ce3+ ions through their ends, stretching the NO bonds by about 0.1 Å compared to their free state. This indicates the importance of ΔEv in facilitating such chemical reactions on the oxide surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制表明，在氧化物催化氧化反应中，两个NO分子吸附在相邻的氧空位上会反应生成氮气。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。本研究发现，铈酸盐（110）表面最稳定的氧空位对配置是最近邻对（P15）。当两个NO分子吸附在这个氧空位对上时，它们通过两端与表面Ce3+离子结合，使NO键的长度伸长约0.1 Å相比其自由状态。这表明ΔEv在促进氧化物表面上的此类化学反应中的重要性。
