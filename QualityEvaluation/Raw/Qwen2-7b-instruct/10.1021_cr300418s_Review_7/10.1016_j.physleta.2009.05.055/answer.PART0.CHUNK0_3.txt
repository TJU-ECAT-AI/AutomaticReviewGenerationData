[1] "The formation of a surface oxygen vacancy induces very large relaxations, similar to the features that have been found in our previous paper for the CeO2(110)p(2 × 2) [27]."
[2] "Reduction strongly modifies the electronic structure of the ceria surface. The total density of states (TDOS) for the ceria (110) surface with a single-oxygen vacancy is shown in Fig. 2(c)."
[3] "The distribution of the excess electron density (corresponding to the gap states) for all the other vacancy pair constellations studied here are shown in Fig. 5."
[4] "Two main factors, i.e. structural adaptation and electronic adaptation, are found to be decisive for the formation energy and the association energy of the oxygen vacancy pairs and therefore determine final geometrical structure of the oxygen vacancy pairs."
[5] "The most stable configuration of an oxygen vacancy pair on the ceria (110) is the P15 pattern (the next nearest neighboring pair) instead of the nearest neighboring pairs."
[6] "For some of the other oxygen vacancy pairs examined, the electron localization is clearly different from the sum of two isolated vacancies, and often involves the creation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer."

1. The formation of a surface oxygen vacancy on ceria leads to significant structural changes, similar to those observed in previous studies on CeO2(110)p(2 × 2). Reduction significantly alters the electronic structure of the ceria surface.

2. The total density of states for the ceria (110) surface with a single-oxygen vacancy is depicted in Figure 2(c).

3. The distribution of the excess electron density for all other oxygen vacancy pair configurations is illustrated in Figure 5.

4. Structural adaptation and electronic adaptation are the key factors influencing the formation energy, association energy, and geometrical structure of oxygen vacancy pairs.

5. The most favorable configuration for an oxygen vacancy pair on the ceria (110) surface is the next nearest neighbor pattern, specifically the P15 structure.

6. For certain oxygen vacancy pairs, electron localization differs significantly from that of two isolated vacancies, often resulting in the formation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer.

1. 在铈氧化物表面形成氧空位会引发显著的结构变化，与之前在CeO2(110)p(2 × 2)上的研究发现类似。氧还原显著改变了铈氧化物表面的电子结构。

2. 图2(c)展示了铈(110)表面具有单个氧空位的总密度态。

3. 所有其他氧空位对构型的多余电子密度分布图在图5中展示。

4. 结构适应和电子适应是决定氧空位对形成能、关联能以及最终几何结构的关键因素。

5. 铈(110)表面最有利的氧空位对配置是最近邻的相邻模式，具体为P15结构。

6. 对某些氧空位对而言，电子局部化明显不同于两个孤立空位的总和，常常导致第二原子层中铈3+离子的形成。
