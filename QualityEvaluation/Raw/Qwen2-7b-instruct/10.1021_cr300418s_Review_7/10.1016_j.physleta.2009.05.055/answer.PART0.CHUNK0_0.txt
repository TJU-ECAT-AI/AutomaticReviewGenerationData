[1] "It is known that the ceria (111) surface is the most stable surface and has been studied extensively, including a recent paper by David Kings group which studied the vacancy clusters on the (111) surface."
[2] "For some of the other oxygen vacancy pairs examined, the electron localization is clearly different from the sum of two isolated va- cansies, and often involves the creation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer."
[3] "In the DFT + U method,a Hubbard parameter, U, is introduced for the Ce4 f electrons to describe the on-site Coulomb interaction; this helps to remove the self-interaction error and improves the description of correlation effects."
[4] "By substituting (2) and (3) into (1), we can write Epairing as Epairing = E(vi, v j) 2E(v) + E(CeO2)."
[5] "The fully relaxed atomic structure is displayed in Fig. 4(a). Only the top view with the distribution of the excess electrons (which will be discussed later) is shown."
[6] "It is found that the P15 oxygen vacancy pair structure on the ceria (110) surface is the most favor- able."
[7] "For the most stable oxygen vacancy pair pattern (the P15 pattern), extra electron localization is found on four neighboring Ce4+ ions, which are reduced to Ce3+."

1. The ceria (111) surface is recognized as the most stable surface, and it has been widely studied, particularly in relation to vacancy cluster formations.
2. Electron localization for certain oxygen vacancy pairs deviates from the combined effect of two isolated vacancies, often resulting in the formation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer.
3. In the DFT + U method, a Hubbard parameter U is introduced to account for the on-site Coulomb interaction among Ce4 f electrons, aiding in addressing self-interaction errors and enhancing the representation of correlation effects.
4. The expression for the association energy of oxygen vacancy pairs (Epairing) is derived by substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (1).
5. The fully relaxed atomic structure for the oxygen vacancy pair is illustrated in Figure 4(a), focusing on the top view and the distribution of excess electrons.
6. The P15 oxygen vacancy pair structure on the ceria (110) surface is identified as the most favorable configuration.
7. In the most stable oxygen vacancy pair pattern (the P15 pattern), extra electron localization occurs on four adjacent Ce4+ ions, which are converted to Ce3+ ions.

1. 111表面是公认的最稳定的表面，并且它被广泛研究，特别是在关于空位簇形成的研究中。
2. 对于某些氧空位对来说，电子分布不同于两个孤立空位的总和，通常涉及到第二原子层中形成Ce3+离子的情况。
3. 在DFT + U方法中，引入了一个Hubbard参数U来描述Ce4 f电子的局域电荷相互作用，有助于解决自交互错误并改善相关效应的描述。
4. 表达式Epairing（氧空位对的关联能）通过将等式（2）和（3）代入等式（1）进行推导得出。
5. 氧空位对的完全松弛原子结构在图4(a)中显示，仅展示了顶部视图以及过剩电子的分布情况。
6. P15氧空位对结构在氧化铈（110）表面上被认为是最佳的配置。
7. 在最稳定的氧空位对模式（P15模式）中，额外的电子分布在四个相邻的Ce4+离子上，这些离子转化为Ce3+离子。
