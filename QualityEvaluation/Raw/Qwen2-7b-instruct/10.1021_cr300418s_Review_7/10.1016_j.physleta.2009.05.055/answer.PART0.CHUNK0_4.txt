[1] "Daturi et al. [10] have proposed a mechanism for the dissociation of NO on ceria whereby two NO molecules adsorbed on neighboring oxygen vacancies react to give dinitrogen."
[2] "We found that the most stable configuration of an oxygen vacancy pair on the ceria (110) is the P15 pattern (the next nearest neighboring pair) instead of the nearest neighboring pairs."
[3] "The adsorbed NO molecules bind with the surface Ce3+ ions neighboring the vacan- cies through their both ends and the NO bonds are stretched by about 0.1 Å as compared with the calculated value for the free NO."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism suggests that in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, two NO molecules adsorbed on neighboring oxygen vacancies react to form dinitrogen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In this study, it was found that the most stable oxygen vacancy pair configuration on the ceria (110) surface is the next nearest neighbor pattern (P15). When two NO molecules adsorb on this oxygen vacancy pair, they bind with the surface Ce3+ ions through their ends, stretching the NO bonds by about 0.1 Å compared to their free state. This indicates the importance of ΔEv in facilitating such chemical reactions on the oxide surface.

Mars-van Krevelen机制表明，在氧化物催化氧化反应中，两个NO分子吸附在相邻的氧空位上会反应生成氮气。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。本研究发现，铈酸盐（110）表面最稳定的氧空位对配置是最近邻对（P15）。当两个NO分子吸附在这个氧空位对上时，它们通过两端与表面Ce3+离子结合，使NO键的长度伸长约0.1 Å相比其自由状态。这表明ΔEv在促进氧化物表面上的此类化学反应中的重要性。
