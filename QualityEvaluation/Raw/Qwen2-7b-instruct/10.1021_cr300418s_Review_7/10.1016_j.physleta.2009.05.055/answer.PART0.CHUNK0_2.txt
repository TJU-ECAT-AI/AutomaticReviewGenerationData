[1] "The computational method is briefly described in Section 2. The results are presented and discussed in Section 3. Conclusions are finally summarized in Section 4."
[2] "The most favorable oxygen vacancy pair is the next nearest neighbor pattern (i.e., the P15 pattern in our denotation), instead of the nearest neighbor pattern."
[3] "Two main factors,i.e. structural adaptation and electronic adaptation, are found to be decisive for the formation energy and the association energy of the oxygen vacancy pairs and therefore determine final geometrical structure of the oxygen vacancy pairs."
[4] "The electronic properties of the oxygen vacancy pairs were studied through the density of states and the charge density analyses. For the most stable oxygen vacancy pair pattern (the P15 pattern), extra electron localization is found on four neighboring Ce4+ ions, which are reduced to Ce3+."
[5] "For some of the other oxygen vacancy pairs examined, the electron localization is clearly different from the sum of two isolated vacancies, and often involves the creation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. This energy is crucial as it influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

2. In the context of the study, the ΔEv plays a significant role in determining the stability and formation of oxygen vacancy pairs on the ceria surface. The next nearest neighbor pattern (P15) was found to be the most favorable configuration for these pairs due to its unique balance between structural and electronic adaptations.

3. Structural adaptation involves the excess electrons localizing closer to the vacancies, whereas electronic adaptation encourages the excess electrons to depart as far as possible. This balance determines the final geometrical structure of the oxygen vacancy pairs.

4. The electronic properties of the oxygen vacancy pairs were analyzed through density of states and charge density analyses. For the most stable configuration (P15), the extra electrons are localized on four neighboring Ce4+ ions, which are reduced to Ce3+. This localization differs from the sum of two isolated vacancies, often involving the creation of Ce3+ ions in the second atomic layer for other configurations.

5. The ΔEv is essential for understanding the dissociation mechanism of NO molecules on ceria. It influences the formation of oxygen vacancy pairs and the subsequent interactions between NO molecules and the surface Ce3+ ions. The study suggests that factors such as doping with metal atoms might be needed to enhance the formation of nearest neighbor vacancy pairs or clusters.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。这一能量对催化剂活性和氧化能力具有重要影响。

2. 在研究中，ΔEv对于确定铈表面氧空位对的稳定性和形成至关重要。发现最有利的氧空位对配置为最近邻邻居模式（即P15模式），由于其独特的结构适应性和电子适应性平衡，这成为最有利的配置。

3. 结构适应性涉及多余的电子局部化在更接近空位的位置，而电子适应性鼓励多余的电子尽可能地远离。这种平衡决定了氧空位对的最终几何结构。

4. 通过密度状态和电荷密度分析研究了氧空位对的电子性质。在最稳定的配置（P15）中，额外的电子局部化在四个相邻的Ce4+离子上，这些离子被还原为Ce3+。这一局部化与两个孤立空位之和不同，其他配置往往涉及到第二原子层中Ce3+离子的创建。

5. ΔEv对于理解NO分子在铈上的分解机制至关重要。它影响氧空位对的形成以及随后NO分子与表面Ce3+离子之间的相互作用。研究建议，向铈掺杂金属原子可能需要增强最近邻氧空位对或簇的形成。
