[1] "The nomenclature used for describing the structure of the TiO2(110) surface is defined in Figure 1."
[2] "The removal of a neutral oxygen atom leaves behind two electrons that had been engaged in two TiO bonds that were broken when the vacancy was formed. In what follows we call these the unpaired electrons (UPEs)."
[3] "Recent experiments (22, 55) suggest that the unpaired electrons produced by O removal are delocalized on the subsurface Ti atoms."
[4] "The energy of vacancy formation depends on the location of this pair of reduced Ti atoms."
[5] "The lowest energy structure found by the B3LYP calculations of Di Valentin et al. (67) belongs to the fifth category defined here: one UPE is on a subsurface Ti3+ atom and the other on the 6c-Ti* atom."
[6] "The adsorption of an electrophile on the reduced TiO2 surface uses one of the two UPEs created when the oxygen vacancy was formed, we expect that the adsorption energy of the electrophile will depend on the position of the remaining UPE."

1. The structure of the TiO2(110) surface is described in Figure 1 of the document.
2. When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface, two unpaired electrons are left behind.
3. Experiments suggest that these unpaired electrons are delocalized on the subsurface Ti atoms.
4. The energy required to form an oxygen vacancy is influenced by the location of the reduced Ti atoms.
5. In the fifth category of states determined by B3LYP calculations, one unpaired electron is on a subsurface Ti3+ atom and the other on a 6c-Ti* atom.
6. The adsorption energy of an electrophile on the reduced TiO2 surface is dependent on the location of the remaining unpaired electron.
