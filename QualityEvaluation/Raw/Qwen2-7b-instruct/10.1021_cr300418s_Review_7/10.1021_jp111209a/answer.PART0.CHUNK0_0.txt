1. Rutile TiO2 is utilized in catalysis, as a photocatalyst, and for photoelectrochemical water splitting.
2. Oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 are chemically active and chemisorb various molecules unless the oxide is carefully oxidized.
3. When an oxygen atom is removed, two electrons that were involved in TiO bonds are left behind.
4. The structure of the TiO2(110) surface is described in Figure 1.
5. The selection of the U value has no clear superiority, so calculations were conducted with a range from 0 to 6 eV to assess the impact on conclusions.
6. Experiments by (22, 55) indicate that the unpaired electrons resulting from oxygen removal are delocalized on subsurface Ti atoms.
7. Oxygen vacancies significantly alter the adsorption of electrophilic adsorbates.
8. At U = 2.5 eV, there are five types of energy minima states.
9. For U ≥ 2.0 eV, the system does not form stable polarons.
10. The lowest energy structure identified by B3LYP calculations of Di Valentin et al. (67) falls into the fifth category defined here.
11. This structure has higher energy than the first four categories.
12. Polaron formation and its location must be considered whenever a chemical process provides electrons to a reducible oxide.

2. 除非氧化物被仔细氧化，否则TiO2表面的氧空位具有化学活性并吸附各种分子。
3. 当移除一个氧原子时，会留下两个参与TiO键的电子。
4. TiO2(110)表面的结构在图1中描述。
5. 在选择U值时没有明显的优越性，因此进行了从0到6 eV范围的计算，以评估结论的影响。
6. (22, 55)的实验表明，从氧气去除后产生的未配对电子在亚表面Ti原子上是分散开的。
7. 氧空位显著改变了亲电吸附剂的吸附。
8. 当U=2.5 eV时，存在五种能量极小状态类型。
9. 对于U≥2.0 eV，系统不会形成稳定的离子。
