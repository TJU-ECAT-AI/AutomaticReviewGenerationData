[1] "When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface of rutile TiO2(110), to make an oxygen vacancy, two unpaired electrons are left in the oxide."
[2] "The energy of vacancy formation depends on the location of this pair of reduced Ti atoms."
[3] "Previous calculations proposed that the unpaired electrons reduced two Ti atoms located near the vacancy."
[4] "However, B3LYP calculations found that one electron is located on a 6c-Ti* atom, as predicted by PBE+U (U = 4.2 eV), but the second one is on a 5c-Ti atom located next to the vacancy site."
[5] "The lowest energy structure found by the B3LYP calculations of Di Valentin et al. (67) belongs to the fifth category defined here: one UPE is on a subsurface Ti3+ atom and the other on the 6c-Ti* atom."
