[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of an adsorbed oxygen species on the oxide surface, which then facilitates the oxidation reaction."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
