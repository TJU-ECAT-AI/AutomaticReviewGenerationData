1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the following process: the species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. This mechanism suggests that activating surface oxygen can lead to more efficient catalysts capable of working at lower temperatures or exhibiting higher reactivity compared to untreated oxides.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By reducing ΔEv through doping, the oxide becomes a more effective oxidant, potentially lowering the activation energy for the reaction and enhancing the reactivity of the surface oxygen.

1. 马斯-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的操作过程如下：要被氧化的物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。这表明激活表面氧可以导致更高效的催化剂，其工作温度更低或表现出更高的活性，与未经处理的氧化物相比。

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。通过掺杂降低ΔEv，氧化物成为更有效的氧化剂，可能降低反应的活化能并增强表面氧的活性。
