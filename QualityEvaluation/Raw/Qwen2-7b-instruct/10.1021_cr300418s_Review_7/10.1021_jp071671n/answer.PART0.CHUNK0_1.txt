The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by having the species to be oxidized react with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a more efficient catalyst as it signifies that the oxide is a good oxidant and willing to give oxygen to reactants, facilitating the creation of oxygen vacancies. This mechanism is crucial for the effectiveness of oxides in oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. By modifying the oxide surface through doping, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation can be reduced, enhancing the oxide's oxidative power and potentially lowering the temperature required for these reactions to occur.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应产生氧空位来操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物是良好的氧化剂，能够提供氧气给反应物，促进氧空位的产生。这种机制对于氧化物在氧化和氧化脱氢反应中的有效性至关重要。通过掺杂修改氧化物表面，可以降低氧空位形成的能量需求，增强氧化物的氧化性能，并可能降低进行这些反应所需的温度。
