[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides."
[2] "In what follows, we call D a dopant, MmOn the host oxide, and DxMm-xOn a doped oxide."
[3] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
[4] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[5] "These calculations lead us to conclude that doping an oxide is an efficient method of modifying its oxidative power."
[6] "For most dopants tried in our previous calculations (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Ni), the formal charge of the dopant is lower than the formal charge of the atoms they substitute in the host oxide (TiO2 or CeO2)."
[7] "Given the small number of systems studied so far, it is difficult to determine if there any rules that may govern how a dopant will affect the oxygen atoms in a given host oxide."
[8] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO."
[9] "The OVFE in doped ZnO(1010) is shown in Figure 2."
[10] "In the second class we placed Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, which have the same formal charge in their oxides as Zn in ZnO (i.e., the stoichiometry of alkali-earth metal oxide is the same as that of ZnO)."
[11] "In group 3, 4, and 5 have oxidation states +3, +4, and +5, with chemical formulas D2O3, DO2, and D2O5 respectively."
[12] "Among these, only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, comparable to that caused by alkali dopants."
[13] "The total energy of the slab with the dopant at the surface minus the total energy of the same slab with the dopant in the bulk are given in Figure 2 at the bottom of each box (in italic font)."
[14] "All alkaline earth dopants, except Mg, prefer to be at the surface even though their bond with oxygen is strong. This is primarily due to their large size, as is evident from their structure, which is similar to that of Cs."
[15] "Our overall conclusion is that there is hope that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs there are some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through two essential steps. First, the oxide acts as a good oxidant, willing to donate oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be capable of adsorbing an oxygen molecule and activating it to provide an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and another atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it reflects the ease with which the oxide can form an oxygen vacancy.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. It indicates the ease with which the oxide can form an oxygen vacancy, which is a critical step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values suggest that the oxide can more easily form an oxygen vacancy, thereby increasing its catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

3. Doping an oxide modifies its oxidative power by changing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). Specifically, the study found that doping with alkali metals, silver, and gold decreases ΔEv, making the oxide more prone to forming oxygen vacancies. This modification enhances the oxide's ability to catalyze oxidation reactions by improving its oxidizing power.

4. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. By decreasing ΔEv through doping, the oxide's ability to facilitate the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is enhanced, potentially leading to improved performance in oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) serves as a quantitative measure to evaluate the oxidative power of doped oxides. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide can more readily form an oxygen vacancy, which is essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to proceed efficiently. This suggests that modifying the oxide's ability to form oxygen vacancies through doping can significantly impact its catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.

1. 摩斯-范克里夫勒恩机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及两个关键步骤。首先，氧化物作为良好的氧化剂，愿意向反应物捐赠氧气并在表面生成氧空位。其次，氧空位必须能够吸附氧气分子并激活它，使其提供一个氧气原子给被氧化的分子，并将另一个原子提供给氧化物以修复表面的氧空位。氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为它反映了氧化物形成氧空位的容易程度。

2. 氧气空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对于评估氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物更易于形成氧空位，从而增强其催化活性和氧化能力。

3. 通过掺杂，氧化物的氧化性得到了修改，改变了氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）。研究发现，掺杂碱金属、银和金会显著降低ΔEv，使氧化物更容易形成氧空位。这种修改增强了氧化物催化氧化反应的能力，通过提高其氧化性。

4. 氧气空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）是评估掺杂氧化物催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。通过降低ΔEv，氧化物能够更有效地形成氧空位，这对于摩斯-范克里夫勒恩机制的顺利进行至关重要。这表明，通过掺杂修改氧化物形成氧空位的能力可以显著影响其催化活性和氧化能力。

5. 氧气空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）用作定量指标来评估掺杂氧化物的氧化性。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物更容易形成氧空位，这对于摩斯-范克里夫勒恩机制的有效进行至关重要。这表明，通过掺杂修改氧化物形成氧空位的能力可以显著影响其催化活性和氧化能力。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by having the species to be oxidized react with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a more efficient catalyst as it signifies that the oxide is a good oxidant and willing to give oxygen to reactants, facilitating the creation of oxygen vacancies. This mechanism is crucial for the effectiveness of oxides in oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. By modifying the oxide surface through doping, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation can be reduced, enhancing the oxide's oxidative power and potentially lowering the temperature required for these reactions to occur.

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the reaction of the species to be oxidized with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, which creates oxygen vacancies. Activating surface oxygen through treatments can enhance the catalyst's activity and oxidizing capability at lower temperatures or with higher reactivity compared to untreated oxides. Zinc oxide (ZnO) was selected for investigation because it allows the study of dopants with a higher formal charge than zinc ions, providing insights into the impact of dopants on oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv). Lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, and cadmium decrease ΔEv and preferentially substitute zinc atoms at the surface of ZnO. Magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, cerium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, iron, ruthenium, cobalt, aluminum, gallium, tin, and lead increase ΔEv. Among these, magnesium prefers to substitute zinc atoms in the bulk, while the rest tend to substitute zinc atoms at the surface. The size of the dopant significantly influences the structure of the doped oxide around a dopant substituting a surface zinc atom. Dopants from groups 3 to 7, which form strong oxygen bonds leading to an increase in ΔEv, prefer to substitute zinc atoms in the bulk rather than at the surface. Larger lanthanide atoms, such as cerium, prefer to segregate to the surface, maintaining a structure similar to cesium. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism comprises two essential steps: the oxide acting as a good oxidant willing to give oxygen to the reactant and creating oxygen vacancies on the surface, and the oxygen vacancies being able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it to provide an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and another to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及被氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。通过激活表面氧的处理可以提高催化剂的活性和氧化能力，在较低温度或更高活性方面与未处理的氧化物相比。锌氧化物（ZnO）被选作研究对象，因为它允许研究比锌离子具有更高形式电荷的掺杂剂，提供有关掺杂剂对氧空位形成能（ΔEv）影响的见解。锂、钠、钾、铷、铯、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银、金和镉降低ΔEv，并倾向于优先在ZnO表面的锌原子处替代。镁、钙、锶、钡、钪、钇、镧、钛、锆、铪、铈、钒、铌、钽、铬、钼、钨、锰、铼、铁、钌、钴、铝、镓、锡和铅增加ΔEv。其中，镁倾向于在内部基体中替代锌原子，而其余则倾向于在表面替代锌原子。掺杂剂的大小显著影响围绕表面锌原子替代的掺杂剂结构的掺杂氧化物结构。从第3组到第7组的掺杂剂，由于形成强氧键导致ΔEv增加，倾向于在内部基体中替代锌原子，而不是在表面上。较大的镧系原子，如铈，倾向于在表面上分离，保持类似于铯的结构。火星-范克雷伦机制包含两个基本步骤：氧化物作为愿意给予氧气给反应物并在此表面创建氧空位的良好氧化剂，以及氧空位能够吸附氧气分子并激活它，以提供一个氧原子给正在被氧化的分子和另一个给氧化物来修复表面的氧空位。
