[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides."
[2] "The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies."
[3] "Since the first step in this mechanism is a reaction with the atoms at the surface of the oxide, it is reasonable to assume that a treatment that activates surface oxygen may help produce oxidation catalysts that work at lower temperature or have higher reactivity than the untreated oxide."
[4] "We have chosen ZnO for two reasons. First, it allows us to study many dopants that have a larger formal charge than the Zn ions they substitute; we have not yet examined such a situation in our previous work. Second, Ti and Ce can switch from a +4 oxidation state to a +3 one and are able to compensate for the disruption caused by doping. Zn has only a +2 oxidation state and lacks this flexibility."
[5] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO."
[6] "Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE."
[7] "All alkaline earth dopants, except Mg, prefer to be at the surface even though their bond with oxygen is strong. This is primarily due to their large size, as is evident from their structure, which is similar to that of Cs."
[8] "As the dopants from group 3 to group 7 form strong oxygen bonds leading to increase in OVFE, it is not surprising that they prefer to substitute Zn in the bulk rather than in the surface."
[9] "The increase in size of the atom also affects the structure of doped oxide around a dopant substituting a surface Zn atom."
[10] "Conclusions The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the reaction of the species to be oxidized with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, which creates oxygen vacancies. Activating surface oxygen through treatments can enhance the catalyst's activity and oxidizing capability at lower temperatures or with higher reactivity compared to untreated oxides. Zinc oxide (ZnO) was selected for investigation because it allows the study of dopants with a higher formal charge than zinc ions, providing insights into the impact of dopants on oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv). Lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, osmium, rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, and cadmium decrease ΔEv and preferentially substitute zinc atoms at the surface of ZnO. Magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, cerium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, iron, ruthenium, cobalt, aluminum, gallium, tin, and lead increase ΔEv. Among these, magnesium prefers to substitute zinc atoms in the bulk, while the rest tend to substitute zinc atoms at the surface. The size of the dopant significantly influences the structure of the doped oxide around a dopant substituting a surface zinc atom. Dopants from groups 3 to 7, which form strong oxygen bonds leading to an increase in ΔEv, prefer to substitute zinc atoms in the bulk rather than at the surface. Larger lanthanide atoms, such as cerium, prefer to segregate to the surface, maintaining a structure similar to cesium. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism comprises two essential steps: the oxide acting as a good oxidant willing to give oxygen to the reactant and creating oxygen vacancies on the surface, and the oxygen vacancies being able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it to provide an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and another to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及被氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应，产生氧空位。通过激活表面氧的处理可以提高催化剂的活性和氧化能力，在较低温度或更高活性方面与未处理的氧化物相比。锌氧化物（ZnO）被选作研究对象，因为它允许研究比锌离子具有更高形式电荷的掺杂剂，提供有关掺杂剂对氧空位形成能（ΔEv）影响的见解。锂、钠、钾、铷、铯、锇、铑、铱、镍、钯、铂、铜、银、金和镉降低ΔEv，并倾向于优先在ZnO表面的锌原子处替代。镁、钙、锶、钡、钪、钇、镧、钛、锆、铪、铈、钒、铌、钽、铬、钼、钨、锰、铼、铁、钌、钴、铝、镓、锡和铅增加ΔEv。其中，镁倾向于在内部基体中替代锌原子，而其余则倾向于在表面替代锌原子。掺杂剂的大小显著影响围绕表面锌原子替代的掺杂剂结构的掺杂氧化物结构。从第3组到第7组的掺杂剂，由于形成强氧键导致ΔEv增加，倾向于在内部基体中替代锌原子，而不是在表面上。较大的镧系原子，如铈，倾向于在表面上分离，保持类似于铯的结构。火星-范克雷伦机制包含两个基本步骤：氧化物作为愿意给予氧气给反应物并在此表面创建氧空位的良好氧化剂，以及氧空位能够吸附氧气分子并激活它，以提供一个氧原子给正在被氧化的分子和另一个给氧化物来修复表面的氧空位。
