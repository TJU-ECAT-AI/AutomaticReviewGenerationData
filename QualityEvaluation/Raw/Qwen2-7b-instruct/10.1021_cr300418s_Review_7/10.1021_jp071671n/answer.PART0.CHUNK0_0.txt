[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides."
[2] "In what follows, we call D a dopant, MmOn the host oxide, and DxMm-xOn a doped oxide."
[3] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
[4] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[5] "These calculations lead us to conclude that doping an oxide is an efficient method of modifying its oxidative power."
[6] "For most dopants tried in our previous calculations (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Ni), the formal charge of the dopant is lower than the formal charge of the atoms they substitute in the host oxide (TiO2 or CeO2)."
[7] "Given the small number of systems studied so far, it is difficult to determine if there any rules that may govern how a dopant will affect the oxygen atoms in a given host oxide."
[8] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO."
[9] "The OVFE in doped ZnO(1010) is shown in Figure 2."
[10] "In the second class we placed Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, which have the same formal charge in their oxides as Zn in ZnO (i.e., the stoichiometry of alkali-earth metal oxide is the same as that of ZnO)."
[11] "In group 3, 4, and 5 have oxidation states +3, +4, and +5, with chemical formulas D2O3, DO2, and D2O5 respectively."
[12] "Among these, only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, comparable to that caused by alkali dopants."
[13] "The total energy of the slab with the dopant at the surface minus the total energy of the same slab with the dopant in the bulk are given in Figure 2 at the bottom of each box (in italic font)."
[14] "All alkaline earth dopants, except Mg, prefer to be at the surface even though their bond with oxygen is strong. This is primarily due to their large size, as is evident from their structure, which is similar to that of Cs."
[15] "Our overall conclusion is that there is hope that among so many possible dopant-oxide host pairs there are some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through two essential steps. First, the oxide acts as a good oxidant, willing to donate oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be capable of adsorbing an oxygen molecule and activating it to provide an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and another atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it reflects the ease with which the oxide can form an oxygen vacancy.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. It indicates the ease with which the oxide can form an oxygen vacancy, which is a critical step in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values suggest that the oxide can more easily form an oxygen vacancy, thereby increasing its catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

3. Doping an oxide modifies its oxidative power by changing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). Specifically, the study found that doping with alkali metals, silver, and gold decreases ΔEv, making the oxide more prone to forming oxygen vacancies. This modification enhances the oxide's ability to catalyze oxidation reactions by improving its oxidizing power.

4. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a key factor in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces. By decreasing ΔEv through doping, the oxide's ability to facilitate the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is enhanced, potentially leading to improved performance in oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.

5. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) serves as a quantitative measure to evaluate the oxidative power of doped oxides. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxide can more readily form an oxygen vacancy, which is essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to proceed efficiently. This suggests that modifying the oxide's ability to form oxygen vacancies through doping can significantly impact its catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.

1. 摩斯-范克里夫勒恩机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及两个关键步骤。首先，氧化物作为良好的氧化剂，愿意向反应物捐赠氧气并在表面生成氧空位。其次，氧空位必须能够吸附氧气分子并激活它，使其提供一个氧气原子给被氧化的分子，并将另一个原子提供给氧化物以修复表面的氧空位。氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为它反映了氧化物形成氧空位的容易程度。
