[1] "A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides."
[2] "In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies."
[3] "Since the first step in this mechanism is a reaction with the atoms at the surface of the oxide, it is reasonable to assume that a treatment that activates surface oxygen may help produce oxidation catalysts that work at lower temperature or have higher reactivity than the untreated oxide."
[4] "We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions."
[5] "We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk."
[6] "Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface."
[7] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the reaction of species to be oxidized with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, which generates oxygen vacancies. Activating surface oxygen through treatments might enhance the catalytic activity and reactivity of the oxide at lower temperatures or higher rates than untreated oxides.

2. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) serves as a metric to assess how easily lattice oxygen can participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen oxidation mechanisms.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，马斯-范克雷伦机制通过使待氧化物种与氧化物表面的氧原子反应并产生氧空位来运行。通过处理激活表面氧可以提高氧化物在较低温度或更高速率下的催化活性和氧化能力。

2. 氧空位形成能（OVFE）作为衡量氧化物表面参与马斯和范克雷伦氧化机制的氧的易程度的一个指标。
