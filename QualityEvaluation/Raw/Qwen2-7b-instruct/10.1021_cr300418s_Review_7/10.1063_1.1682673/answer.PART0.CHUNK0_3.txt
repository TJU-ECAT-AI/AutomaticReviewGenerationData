1. The formation energy of a defect or impurity in charge state q is calculated by subtracting the total energy of the defect or impurity from the total energy of the host material in the absence of the defect, accounting for the chemical potentials of the atoms involved and the energy of the valence band maximum in the bulk.

2. Mg in GaN acts as an acceptor only when it is incorporated onto the gallium site within the lattice structure.

3. Native defects are often proposed to account for various issues in semiconductor doping, such as conductivity and compensation effects.

4. The solubility of Mg in GaN is restricted due to the formation of Mg3N2, which is energetically unfavorable.

5. The ionization energy of a dopant influences the proportion of dopants that contribute to free carrier concentration at a given temperature, with higher ionization energies limiting doping efficiency.

1. 缺陷或杂质在电荷状态q的形成能通过从不含缺陷的宿主材料的总能量中减去该缺陷或杂质的总能量来计算，同时考虑参与原子的化学势和本体价带最大值的能量。

2. Mg在GaN中仅当它被整合到镓位点时才作为受主。

3. 自然缺陷经常被用来解释半导体掺杂过程中的各种问题，如导电性和补偿效应。

4. Mg在GaN中的溶解度受限于形成Mg3N2，这是一个从能量上不利的过程。

5. 捐赠剂的离子化能决定了给定温度下有多少捐赠剂贡献自由载流子浓度，较高的离子化能限制了掺杂效率。
