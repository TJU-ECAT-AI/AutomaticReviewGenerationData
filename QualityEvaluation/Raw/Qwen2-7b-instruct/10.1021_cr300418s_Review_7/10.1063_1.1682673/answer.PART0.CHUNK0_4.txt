The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy barrier affects the reaction kinetics and selectivity, influencing how efficiently the catalyst can convert reactants into products. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity, facilitating faster oxidation reactions. The significance of ΔEv lies in its role as a key factor in determining the efficiency and effectiveness of the oxide catalyst in oxidation processes.
