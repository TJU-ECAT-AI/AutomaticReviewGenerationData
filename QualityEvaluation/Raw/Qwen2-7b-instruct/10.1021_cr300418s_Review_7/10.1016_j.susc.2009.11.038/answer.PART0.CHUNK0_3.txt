[1] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Au(1 1 1) produces an excellent WGS catalysts [6]."
[2] "In TiO2x/Au(1 1 1) and CeO2x/Au(1 1 1), water dissociates on O vacancies of the oxide nanoparticles, CO adsorbs on Au sites located nearby, and subsequent reaction steps take place at the metaloxide interface."
[3] "The WGS on Cu(1 1 1) has an apparent activation energy of 0.78 eV, which is 0.10.2 eV larger than that found on Cu(1 0 0) and Cu(1 1 0)."
[4] "In CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) catalyst, the dominant oxidation state of cerium was 3+. This was not the case for the Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) catalyst."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (OVs) as key sites for oxygen uptake and the formation of active oxygen species. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen to be adsorbed and thus facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This is because the presence of OVs provides additional sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, leading to the formation of superoxide ions or other highly reactive oxygen species that can effectively participate in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位（OV）作为关键位点来实现氧气吸收和活性氧物种的形成。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用。ΔEv值较低表示氧气更容易被吸附，从而促进活性氧物种的生成，增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为OV的存在提供了额外的位点用于氧气分子的吸附，导致超氧离子或其他高度反应性的氧物种的形成，这些物种能够有效地参与氧化反应。
