[1] "In these inverse catalysts, the moderate chemical activity of bulk gold is coupled to that of a more reactive oxide."
[2] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV) with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV."
[3] "This was not the case for the Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) catalyst, where there were only a few O vacancies in the ceria support."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of the literature, the transformation of the water dissociation process into an exothermic reaction upon deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) indicates a decrease in ΔEv, leading to a reduction in activation energy. This change enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Additionally, the presence of fewer oxygen vacancies in the Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) catalyst compared to the CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) system suggests that the configuration of the catalyst plays a crucial role in its activity and performance.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在文献的背景下，铈氧化物纳米颗粒沉积在铜(1 1 1)上的水解离过程转变为放热过程（DE = 0.33 eV），且激活能小于0.35 eV，这表明ΔEv的减少促进了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。此外，与铜/铈氧化物(1 1 1)催化剂相比，铈氧化物/铜系统中的氧空位数量较少，表明催化剂的配置对其活性和性能至关重要。
