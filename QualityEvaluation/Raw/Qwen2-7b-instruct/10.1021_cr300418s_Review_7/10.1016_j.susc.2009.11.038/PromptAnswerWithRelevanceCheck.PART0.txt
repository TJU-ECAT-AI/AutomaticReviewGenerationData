[1] "Studies of metal oxide catalysts have widely increased in recent years due to the important role that these materials play in industrial catalytic processes for the conversion of hydrocarbons, the control of environmental pollution and the synthesis of fuels."
[2] "Furthermore, a very large number of industrial catalysts consist of metal particles dispersed over an oxide support."
[3] "In these systems, the oxide can behave as simple template for the dispersion of the metal or it can participate directly into the catalytic process."
[4] "There is a general desire to improve the configuration of industrial catalysts to take advantage of the intrinsic properties of metal oxides and achieve a better performance."
[5] "Oxide nanoparticles can exhibit unique physical and chemical properties due to their size and a high density of defects and corner or edge surface sites."
[6] "As shown in Fig. 1, an inverse oxide/metal catalyst exposes oxide nanoparticles to the reactants."
[7] "Defect sites present in the oxide are not covered by metal particles, as in the case of a traditional metal/oxide catalyst."
[8] "On the inverse oxide/metal catalyst, the reactants can interact with defect sites of the oxide nanoparticles, metal sites, and the metaloxide interface."
[9] "Oxide/metal systems have been around in surface science for a long time."
[10] "The application of surface science techniques are limited when working with oxide single crystals."
[11] "Due to its ability to undergo a facile conversion between 4+ and 3+ oxidation states, ceria has unique applications in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."
[12] "The reducibility of the oxide/metal systems can be an important property since many bulk oxides exhibit a low reactivity and become chemically active only after the generation of O vacancies."
[13] "CeO2 nanoparticles deposited on Rh(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1), Cu(1 1 1), and Au(1 1 1) are much easier to reduce than extended surfaces of bulk CeO2."
[14] "Once the OH groups are formed, subsequent steps for the WGS process occur readily on the gold substrate."
[15] "The CeO2/Au(1 1 1) system can be easily reduced with CO gas, and in the presence of Ce3+ cations there is a fast dissociation of water."
[16] "Au(1 1 1) cannot dissociate water and, therefore, is not able to catalyze the watergas shift (WGS) reaction."
[17] "Cu(1 1 1) has become a benchmark surface for studying the WGS reaction."
[18] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV) with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV."
[19] "This value is also smaller than the corresponding value found for Cu nanoparticles supported on CeO2(1 1 1), 0.39 eV."
[20] "Thus, CeOx/Cu seems to be the best catalyst in terms of activity or apparent activation energy."
[21] "Post-reaction surface analysis indicated that the dominant oxidation state of cerium in the CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) catalyst was 3+."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv signifies the energy needed for the creation of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for facilitating the oxidative process. In catalysts with a lower ΔEv, the reaction is more energetically favorable, leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This mechanism allows the catalyst to efficiently promote oxidation reactions by providing the necessary energy for oxygen to participate actively in the chemical transformations, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the catalytic process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial because they facilitate the transfer of electrons from the surface to the reactant molecules, enabling the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that fewer energy barriers are needed for oxygen vacancies to form, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because the presence of more oxygen vacancies increases the surface area available for the reaction, leading to higher efficiency in the conversion of reactants into products. Additionally, the stability and distribution of these oxygen vacancies influence the reaction kinetics, making them a key factor in the effectiveness of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, which can enhance the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions, thus improving the catalyst's efficiency.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is crucial because it affects the stability and reactivity of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest easier formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to enhanced surface reactivity and potentially higher catalytic activity. This is because oxygen vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption and reaction of substrates, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the oxidation process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (OVs) as key sites for oxygen uptake and the formation of active oxygen species. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen to be adsorbed and thus facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This is because the presence of OVs provides additional sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, leading to the formation of superoxide ions or other highly reactive oxygen species that can effectively participate in oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of the literature, the transformation of the water dissociation process into an exothermic reaction upon deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) indicates a decrease in ΔEv, leading to a reduction in activation energy. This change enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Additionally, the presence of fewer oxygen vacancies in the Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) catalyst compared to the CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) system suggests that the configuration of the catalyst plays a crucial role in its activity and performance.
