[1] "The application of surface science techniques are limited when working with oxide single crystals [8]."
[2] "Since oxides can be insulators, the possibility of sample charging puts serious constraints on the application of electron- and ion-based characterization techniques."
[3] "As we will see below, the special properties of an oxide/metal interface can be used to improve or tune the activity of a catalyst."
[4] "Oxide/metal systems have been around in surface science for a long time [9,10]."
[5] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles and films has been studied on close packed metal surfaces of Ni [19], Cu [7,20,21], Rh [14,22], Ru [19,23,24], Pd [25], Re [26], Pt [15,27,28], and Au [6,16]."
[6] "CeO2 nanoparticles deposited on Rh(1 1 1) [22], Pt(1 1 1) [15], Cu(1 1 1) [7] and Au(1 1 1) [6] are much easier to reduce than extended surfaces of bulk CeO2."
[7] "In TiO2x/Au(1 1 1) and CeO2x/Au(1 1 1), water dissociates on O vacancies of the oxide nanoparticles, CO adsorbs on Au sites located nearby, and subsequent reaction steps take place at the metaloxide interface."
[8] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV) with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV [7]."
[9] "For comparison, we include results obtained under the same conditions for Cu(1 0 0) and 0.5 ML of Cu deposited on CeO2(1 1 1) [34]."
[10] "Post-reaction surface analysis indicated that the dominant oxidation state of cerium in the CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) catalyst was 3+. This was not the case for the Cu/CeO2(1 1 1) catalyst [34], where there were only a few O vacancies in the ceria support."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, which can enhance the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions, thus improving the catalyst's efficiency.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is crucial because it affects the stability and reactivity of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest easier formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to enhanced surface reactivity and potentially higher catalytic activity. This is because oxygen vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption and reaction of substrates, thereby increasing the overall efficiency of the oxidation process.
