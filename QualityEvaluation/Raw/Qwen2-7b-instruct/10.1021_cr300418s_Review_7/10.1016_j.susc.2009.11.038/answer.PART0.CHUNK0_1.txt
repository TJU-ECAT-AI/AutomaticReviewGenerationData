The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial because they facilitate the transfer of electrons from the surface to the reactant molecules, enabling the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that fewer energy barriers are needed for oxygen vacancies to form, thus enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because the presence of more oxygen vacancies increases the surface area available for the reaction, leading to higher efficiency in the conversion of reactants into products. Additionally, the stability and distribution of these oxygen vacancies influence the reaction kinetics, making them a key factor in the effectiveness of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位（Ov）的形成而起作用。氧空位对于电子从表面转移到反应分子至关重要，从而促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv意味着形成氧空位所需的能量障碍较少，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为更多氧空位的存在增加了可用于反应的表面积，从而提高了反应效率，使产物的转化率更高。此外，氧空位的稳定性和分布影响反应动力学，因此它们是氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中有效性的关键因素。
