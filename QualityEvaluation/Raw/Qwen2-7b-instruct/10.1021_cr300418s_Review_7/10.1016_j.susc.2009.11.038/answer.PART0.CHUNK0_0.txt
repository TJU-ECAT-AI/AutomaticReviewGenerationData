[1] "Studies of metal oxide catalysts have widely increased in recent years due to the important role that these materials play in industrial catalytic processes for the conversion of hydrocarbons, the control of environmental pollution and the synthesis of fuels."
[2] "Furthermore, a very large number of industrial catalysts consist of metal particles dispersed over an oxide support."
[3] "In these systems, the oxide can behave as simple template for the dispersion of the metal or it can participate directly into the catalytic process."
[4] "There is a general desire to improve the configuration of industrial catalysts to take advantage of the intrinsic properties of metal oxides and achieve a better performance."
[5] "Oxide nanoparticles can exhibit unique physical and chemical properties due to their size and a high density of defects and corner or edge surface sites."
[6] "As shown in Fig. 1, an inverse oxide/metal catalyst exposes oxide nanoparticles to the reactants."
[7] "Defect sites present in the oxide are not covered by metal particles, as in the case of a traditional metal/oxide catalyst."
[8] "On the inverse oxide/metal catalyst, the reactants can interact with defect sites of the oxide nanoparticles, metal sites, and the metaloxide interface."
[9] "Oxide/metal systems have been around in surface science for a long time."
[10] "The application of surface science techniques are limited when working with oxide single crystals."
[11] "Due to its ability to undergo a facile conversion between 4+ and 3+ oxidation states, ceria has unique applications in the field of heterogeneous catalysis."
[12] "The reducibility of the oxide/metal systems can be an important property since many bulk oxides exhibit a low reactivity and become chemically active only after the generation of O vacancies."
[13] "CeO2 nanoparticles deposited on Rh(1 1 1), Pt(1 1 1), Cu(1 1 1), and Au(1 1 1) are much easier to reduce than extended surfaces of bulk CeO2."
[14] "Once the OH groups are formed, subsequent steps for the WGS process occur readily on the gold substrate."
[15] "The CeO2/Au(1 1 1) system can be easily reduced with CO gas, and in the presence of Ce3+ cations there is a fast dissociation of water."
[16] "Au(1 1 1) cannot dissociate water and, therefore, is not able to catalyze the watergas shift (WGS) reaction."
[17] "Cu(1 1 1) has become a benchmark surface for studying the WGS reaction."
[18] "The deposition of ceria nanoparticles on Cu(1 1 1) transforms the dissociation of water into an exothermic process (DE = 0.33 eV) with an activation energy smaller than 0.35 eV."
[19] "This value is also smaller than the corresponding value found for Cu nanoparticles supported on CeO2(1 1 1), 0.39 eV."
[20] "Thus, CeOx/Cu seems to be the best catalyst in terms of activity or apparent activation energy."
[21] "Post-reaction surface analysis indicated that the dominant oxidation state of cerium in the CeOx/Cu(1 1 1) catalyst was 3+."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv signifies the energy needed for the creation of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for facilitating the oxidative process. In catalysts with a lower ΔEv, the reaction is more energetically favorable, leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This mechanism allows the catalyst to efficiently promote oxidation reactions by providing the necessary energy for oxygen to participate actively in the chemical transformations, thus enhancing the overall efficiency of the catalytic process.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv表示创建氧空位所需的能量，这对于促进氧化过程至关重要。在ΔEv较低的催化剂中，反应更加有利，导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力。这种机制允许催化剂高效促进氧化反应，通过提供必要的能量使氧气积极参与化学转换，从而提高催化过程的整体效率。
