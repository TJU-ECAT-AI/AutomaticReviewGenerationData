[1] "The multiple-valence character of cerium makes the first-principles simulation of ceria compounds inherently challenging due to the existence of numerous competing local energy minima."
[2] "We have shown that, contrary to the common belief based on previous research, the ground state of these systems as predicted by traditional LDA and GGA calculations does display the correct insulating character and oxidation state of the various Ce atoms."
[3] "This ground state may be difficult to access in practice. The addition of a Hubbard-U term to the LDA/GGA energy functional enhances the stability of the physical ground state, making it easily accessible to routine DFT calculations."
[4] "Projections on self-consistent Wannier functions make the structural parameters and the energetics independent of U."
[5] "The calculated energetics is in overall good agreement with experiments, the LDA results being actually better than the GGA ones."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy barrier plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the reaction rate by increasing the availability of reactive oxygen species. This mechanism allows for the efficient transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms across the surface, promoting the oxidation of organic molecules. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to modulate the surface reactivity, making it a key factor in optimizing catalyst performance for various industrial processes, including the production of hydrogen and the reduction of air pollutants.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来操作。这个能量壁垒在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更容易形成，这可以通过增加活性氧物种的可用性来增强反应速率，从而促进有机分子的氧化。ΔEv的重要性在于其能够调节表面反应性，使其成为优化催化剂性能的关键因素，适用于各种工业过程，包括氢的生产以及空气污染物的减少。
