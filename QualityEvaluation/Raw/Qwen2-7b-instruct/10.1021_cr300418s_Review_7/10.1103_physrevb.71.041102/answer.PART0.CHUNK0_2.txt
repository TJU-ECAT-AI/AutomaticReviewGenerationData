<p>There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations ssubstitu- tional CeCe 8 defectsd.</p>
<p>The importance of electronic correlations related with quasidegeneracy and accompanying the f-electron localization process has lead to the widespread belief that conventional density-functional theory sDFTd techniques based on the local-density approximation sLDAd or generalized-gradient approximation sGGAd would be un- able to cope with these systems.</p>
<p>We believe that this conclusion is to some extent misleading. The purpose of this paper is two- fold. We first show that the propensity of cerium to display multiple oxidation states determines the existence of a num- ber of DFT configurations that are stable at the LDA or GGA level, and which had not been identified so far.</p>
<p>The addition of a Hubbard-U term in the LDA sor GGAd energy functional substantially enhances the stability of the physical solution,thus allowing SCF calculations to proceed straight to it.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the Hubbard-U contribution is defined in terms of maximally localized Wannier functions, the energy of the stable configuration is independent of U and therefore coincides with the LDA/GGA values.</p>
<p>The formation energy of CeO2 fDHf=mCeO2mCessd mO2sgd=11.14 eV sRef. 22dg is 211.33 eV in LDA and
29.20 eV in GGA.</p>
<p>Note that the LDA results seem to agree considerably better with experi- ment than the GGA ones.</p>
<p>An oxygen vacancy is modeled by removing a neutral oxygen atom from a CeO2 supercell whose size is deter- mined by the concentration of defects.</p>
<p>In the metallic solution the two excess electrons released in the reduction process result to be evenly distributed among all the four Ce neighbors of the O va- cancy.</p>
<p>The Hubbard-U correction to the energy functional results in a broken-symmetry solution where the two excess electrons localize on two srather than fourd Ce atoms neighboring the vacancy.</p>
<p>This result agrees with the experimental evidence that the compensating defects are CeCe 8 and suggest their tendency to cluster around the oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>The binding energy of molecular O, con- tributing to the reference mO2sgd, is known to be badly pre- dicted by DFT both in the LDA and the GGA.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies to facilitate the oxidation process. Oxygen vacancies act as sites for the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecules, which then participate in the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's reactivity and thus its catalytic performance.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism utilizes oxygen vacancies in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions to facilitate the activation and adsorption of oxygen molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly impacts the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values enable easier formation of oxygen vacancies, thereby increasing the surface's reactivity and catalytic performance.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位来促进氧化过程。氧空位作为氧分子吸附和活化的场所，进而参与氧化反应。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性影响。较低的ΔEv值表示氧空位更容易形成，从而增强表面的活性，进而提高其催化性能。
