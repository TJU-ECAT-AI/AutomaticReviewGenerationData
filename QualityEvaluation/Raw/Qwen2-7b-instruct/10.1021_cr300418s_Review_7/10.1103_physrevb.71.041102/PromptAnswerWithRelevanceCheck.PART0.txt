[1] "Electronic correlation, due to the strong localization of these states in reduced cerias, Ce2O3 and CeO2x, have the effect of splitting the Ce-4f band upon occupation, resulting in a fully occupied gap state experimentally detected to be 1.21.5 eV above the top of the valence band."
[2] "The release of oxygen from the crystal structure has therefore the effect of formally modifying the valency of Ce from 4+ to 3+."
[3] "The addition of a Hubbard-U term to the LDA/GGA energy functional enhances the stability of the physical ground state, making it easily accessible to routine DFT calculations."
[4] "The calculated energetics is in overall good agreement with experiments, the LDA results being actually better than the GGA ones."

1. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy (O vac) on the oxide surface. Oxygen molecules adsorb onto the surface, leading to the creation of an O vac. This vacancy facilitates the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms, enabling the oxidation of organic compounds. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of the O vac, which can enhance the surface's reactivity and catalytic efficiency.
2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the stability and availability of the O vac. A lower ΔEv suggests a more stable O vac, which remains available for further reactions, thereby increasing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷尔机制涉及在氧化物表面上形成氧空位（O vac）。氧气分子吸附到表面，导致形成一个O vac。这个空位有助于电子和氧原子的转移，从而促进了有机化合物的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明O vac更容易形成，这可以增强表面的活性和氧化能力。
2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性在于它对空位稳定性和可用性的影响。较低的ΔEv意味着一个更稳定的O vac，它仍然可用于进一步反应，从而增加表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

[1] "The properties of many technologically relevant materials are determined by the ability of their atomic constituents to display multiple oxidation states and hence a different chemical behavior depending on the local microscopic environment."

[3] "Besides providing a resistant support for chemically active noble metals, ceria-based substrates take an active role in the catalytic reaction by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction sites, acting effectively as oxygen reservoirs."
[4] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations ssubstituents CeCe 8 defectsd."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation affects how efficiently the surface can facilitate the transfer of oxygen atoms during oxidation reactions, thereby impacting the overall efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.

<p>There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations ssubstitu- tional CeCe 8 defectsd.</p>
<p>The importance of electronic correlations related with quasidegeneracy and accompanying the f-electron localization process has lead to the widespread belief that conventional density-functional theory sDFTd techniques based on the local-density approximation sLDAd or generalized-gradient approximation sGGAd would be un- able to cope with these systems.</p>
<p>We believe that this conclusion is to some extent misleading. The purpose of this paper is two- fold. We first show that the propensity of cerium to display multiple oxidation states determines the existence of a num- ber of DFT configurations that are stable at the LDA or GGA level, and which had not been identified so far.</p>
<p>The addition of a Hubbard-U term in the LDA sor GGAd energy functional substantially enhances the stability of the physical solution,thus allowing SCF calculations to proceed straight to it.</p>
<p>Moreover, when the Hubbard-U contribution is defined in terms of maximally localized Wannier functions, the energy of the stable configuration is independent of U and therefore coincides with the LDA/GGA values.</p>
<p>The formation energy of CeO2 fDHf=mCeO2mCessd mO2sgd=11.14 eV sRef. 22dg is 211.33 eV in LDA and
29.20 eV in GGA.</p>
<p>Note that the LDA results seem to agree considerably better with experi- ment than the GGA ones.</p>
<p>An oxygen vacancy is modeled by removing a neutral oxygen atom from a CeO2 supercell whose size is deter- mined by the concentration of defects.</p>
<p>In the metallic solution the two excess electrons released in the reduction process result to be evenly distributed among all the four Ce neighbors of the O va- cancy.</p>
<p>The Hubbard-U correction to the energy functional results in a broken-symmetry solution where the two excess electrons localize on two srather than fourd Ce atoms neighboring the vacancy.</p>
<p>This result agrees with the experimental evidence that the compensating defects are CeCe 8 and suggest their tendency to cluster around the oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>The binding energy of molecular O, con- tributing to the reference mO2sgd, is known to be badly pre- dicted by DFT both in the LDA and the GGA.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies to facilitate the oxidation process. Oxygen vacancies act as sites for the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecules, which then participate in the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's reactivity and thus its catalytic performance.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism utilizes oxygen vacancies in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions to facilitate the activation and adsorption of oxygen molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly impacts the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values enable easier formation of oxygen vacancies, thereby increasing the surface's reactivity and catalytic performance.
