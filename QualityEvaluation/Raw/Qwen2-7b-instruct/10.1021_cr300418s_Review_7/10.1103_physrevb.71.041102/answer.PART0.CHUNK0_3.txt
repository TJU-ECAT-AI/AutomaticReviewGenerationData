[1] "The properties of many technologically relevant materials are determined by the ability of their atomic constituents to display multiple oxidation statesand hence a different chemical behaviordepending on the local microscopic environment."
[2] "A representative example is given by ceria-based materials which are key components of many advanced catalysts used to produce hydrogen and to reduce air pollution."
[3] "The calculation of the heat of reduction per oxygen vacancy depends on the choice of the reference state for the missing O atom."
[4] "The resulting values are 5.05 eV (LDA+U) and 2.01 eV (GGA+U)."
[5] "The energetics were converged with respect to the supercell size to less than 0.3 eV."
[6] "The binding energy of molecular O, contributing to the reference mO2sgd, is known to be badly predicted by DFT both in the LDA and the GGA."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy barrier affects the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv is crucial in determining how readily oxygen can be incorporated into the surface, impacting the reaction rate and efficiency.
