[1] "Electronic correlation, due to the strong localization of these states in reduced cerias, Ce2O3 and CeO2x, have the effect of splitting the Ce-4f band upon occupation, resulting in a fully occupied gap state experimentally detected to be 1.21.5 eV above the top of the valence band."
[2] "The release of oxygen from the crystal structure has therefore the effect of formally modifying the valency of Ce from 4+ to 3+."
[3] "The addition of a Hubbard-U term to the LDA/GGA energy functional enhances the stability of the physical ground state, making it easily accessible to routine DFT calculations."
[4] "The calculated energetics is in overall good agreement with experiments, the LDA results being actually better than the GGA ones."

1. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy (O vac) on the oxide surface. Oxygen molecules adsorb onto the surface, leading to the creation of an O vac. This vacancy facilitates the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms, enabling the oxidation of organic compounds. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of the O vac, which can enhance the surface's reactivity and catalytic efficiency.
2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the stability and availability of the O vac. A lower ΔEv suggests a more stable O vac, which remains available for further reactions, thereby increasing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷尔机制涉及在氧化物表面上形成氧空位（O vac）。氧气分子吸附到表面，导致形成一个O vac。这个空位有助于电子和氧原子的转移，从而促进了有机化合物的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明O vac更容易形成，这可以增强表面的活性和氧化能力。
2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面的重要性在于它对空位稳定性和可用性的影响。较低的ΔEv意味着一个更稳定的O vac，它仍然可用于进一步反应，从而增加表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
