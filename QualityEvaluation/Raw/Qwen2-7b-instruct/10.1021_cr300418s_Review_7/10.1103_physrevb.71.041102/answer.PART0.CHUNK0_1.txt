[1] "The properties of many technologically relevant materials are determined by the ability of their atomic constituents to display multiple oxidation states and hence a different chemical behavior depending on the local microscopic environment."
[2] "A representative example is given by ceria-based materials which are key components of many advanced catalysts used to produce hydrogen and to reduce air pollution."
[3] "Besides providing a resistant support for chemically active noble metals, ceria-based substrates take an active role in the catalytic reaction by controlling the oxygen partial pressure at the reaction sites, acting effectively as oxygen reservoirs."
[4] "There is ample evidence that this property is controlled by the chemistry of oxygen vacancies which are neutralized by the valence change Ce4+Ce3+ of two cations ssubstituents CeCe 8 defectsd."
[5] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation affects how efficiently the surface can facilitate the transfer of oxygen atoms during oxidation reactions, thereby impacting the overall efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic process.
