[1] "Ab initio calculations, however, suggest that the atomic displacements determined from LEED-IV measurements may be compromised by the limited number of optimized atom positions."
[2] "Notably, this relaxed ab initio DFT-GGA geometry is not consistent with experimental work."
[3] "It is concluded that this agreement is a result of virtually the same atoms being optimized in both the five-trilayer slab total energy minimization and the LEED-IV structure determination."
[4] "For clarity, an upper x axis showing the corresponding number of trilayers is included in the figure."
[5] "Moreover, it is almost certain that the reported coincidence of the five-trilayer ab initio DFT geometry and the original LEED-IV solution three-layer optimization shown in Fig. 2b is simply fortuitous."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and movement of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in these processes. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher mobility and stability of the oxygen vacancies, thus influencing the reaction rate and selectivity.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物上的氧空位的形成和移动来操作。氧空位对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在这些过程中起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧空位的更高流动性和稳定性，从而影响反应速率和选择性。
