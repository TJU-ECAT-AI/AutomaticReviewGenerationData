[1] "For clarity, an upper x axis showing the corresponding number of trilayers is included in the figure."
[2] "Focusing on the experimentally derived data, it can be seen that for both O1 and Ti2 displacement becomes almost constant for three-layer optimization and beyond."
[3] "Moreover, it is almost certain that the reported7,8 coincidence of the five-trilayer ab initio DFT geometry and the original LEED-IV solution three-layer optimization shown in Fig. 2b is simply for- tuitous."
[4] "While it is clear one can simply translate atomic displacements into bond lengths and angles, we do agree that for some purposes explicit listing of these latter parameters would give more immediate insight."

The study reanalyzed LEED-IV and SXRD data to confirm the integrity of the previously reported optimized geometries for TiO2(110)(11). The researchers aimed to address concerns raised by ab initio density-functional theory calculations suggesting that the atomic displacements determined from LEED-IV measurements might be compromised due to the limited number of optimized atom positions. By performing structural optimizations as a function of depth into the selvedge, the study validates the previous experimental structure determinations. The analysis demonstrates that the optimized atomic displacements determined from LEED-IV data are reliable, and there is a high degree of agreement between the LEED-IV and SXRD structures, confirming the essential validity of both methods. Additionally, bond lengths and bond angles were provided for selected atoms to offer a more physically relevant perspective on the structure.

研究重新分析了LEED-IV和SXRD数据，以确认之前报告的优化几何结构的完整性对于TiO2(110)(11)。研究人员旨在解决由密度泛函理论计算提出的问题，即从LEED-IV测量中确定的原子位移可能由于优化原子层数量有限而受到影响。通过在边缘深度进行结构优化，研究验证了先前的实验结构确定。分析表明，从LEED-IV数据中确定的优化原子位移是可靠的，并且LEED-IV和SXRD结构之间存在高度一致性，从而确认了两种方法的基本有效性。此外，提供了选定原子的键长和键角，为结构提供了一个更符合物理意义的角度。
