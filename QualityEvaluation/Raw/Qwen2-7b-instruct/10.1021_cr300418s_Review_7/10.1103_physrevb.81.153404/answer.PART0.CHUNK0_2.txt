[1] "This work is performed in response to ab initio density-functional theory calculations that suggest that the atomic displacements determined from low-energy electron-diffraction measurements may be compromised by the limited number of optimized atom positions."
[2] "It is concluded that this agreement is a result of virtually the same atoms being optimized in both the five- trilayer slab total energy minimization and the LEED-IV structure determination, as can be discerned from Figs. 1a and 1b, remembering that a mirror plane is imposed in Fig. 1a."
[3] "As evidenced by the decrease in Rp/2, it is clear that initially the fits improve considerably as the number of layers optimized increases. Beyond six optimized layers equivalent to an 11-trilayer calculated slab there is no further significant improvement in either Rp or 2, i.e., the fits become converged as regards this parameter."
[4] "These two points are demonstrated graphically in Fig. 2b, which displays the displacement of two surface atoms, O1 bridging oxygen and Ti2 fivefold titanium, as a function of the number of optimized layers."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) from the oxide surface to the reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power because it requires less energy for oxygen vacancies to be formed and thus facilitates the reaction more efficiently.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧空位（ΔEv）向反应物的转移来起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性影响。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为形成氧空位需要的能量较少，从而更有效地促进反应。
