[1] "It is striking that the lowest Rp i.e., 0.23 is appreciably smaller than the value i.e., 0.29 obtained following optimization of only the atoms considered in the original structure determination."
[2] "As evidenced by the decrease in Rp/2, it is clear that initially the fits improve considerably as the number of layers optimized increases."
[3] "Beyond six optimized layers equivalent to an 11-trilayer calculated slab there is no further significant improvement in either Rp or 2, i.e., the fits become converged as regards this parameter."

The analysis demonstrates that increasing the number of optimized layers initially leads to a considerable improvement in the fit quality, as measured by the Pendry reliability factor Rp. The lowest Rp value, 0.23, is notably lower than the value of 0.29 obtained when only considering the atoms from the original structure determination. However, beyond six optimized layers, equivalent to an 11-trilayer slab, there is no further significant improvement in Rp or the chi-squared value (χ2), indicating that the fits have become converged regarding these parameters.

分析表明，随着优化层数量的增加，初始的拟合质量显著提高，用Pendry可靠性因子Rp衡量。最低的Rp值为0.23，远低于仅考虑原始结构确定中所考虑原子时得到的值0.29。然而，在优化了六个层之后，相当于一个计算得到的11层三明治结构，无论是Rp还是χ2值都没有进一步的显著改善，这表明在这些参数方面，拟合已经收敛。
