[1] "It is striking that the lowest Rp i.e., 0.23 is appreciably smaller than the value i.e., 0.29 obtained following optimization of only the atoms considered in the original structure determination."
[2] "As evidenced by the decrease in Rp/2, it is clear that initially the fits improve considerably as the number of layers optimized increases."
[3] "Beyond six optimized layers equivalent to an 11-trilayer calculated slab there is no further significant improvement in either Rp or 2, i.e., the fits become converged as regards this parameter."
[4] "As regards precision, one further point to glean from Table I is that the LEED-IV error bars increase much more rapidly with depth than those associated with the SXRD measurements."

The study confirms the integrity of the previously reported optimized geometries of TiO2(110)(11) through re-analysis of low-energy electron-diffraction (LEED) and surface x-ray diffraction (SXRD) data. The researchers perform structural optimizations as a function of depth into the selvedge to validate the experimental structure determinations. The analysis demonstrates that the atomic displacements determined from LEED measurements are not compromised by the limited number of optimized atom positions, contrary to previous suggestions. The results support the essential validity of the previous LEED and SXRD structure determinations.
