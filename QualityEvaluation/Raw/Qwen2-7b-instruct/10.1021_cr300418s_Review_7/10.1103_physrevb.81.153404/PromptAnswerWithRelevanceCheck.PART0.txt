[1] "Ab initio calculations, however, suggest that the atomic displacements determined from LEED-IV measurements may be compromised by the limited number of optimized atom positions."
[2] "Notably, this relaxed ab initio DFT-GGA geometry is not consistent with experimental work."
[3] "It is concluded that this agreement is a result of virtually the same atoms being optimized in both the five-trilayer slab total energy minimization and the LEED-IV structure determination."
[4] "For clarity, an upper x axis showing the corresponding number of trilayers is included in the figure."
[5] "Moreover, it is almost certain that the reported coincidence of the five-trilayer ab initio DFT geometry and the original LEED-IV solution three-layer optimization shown in Fig. 2b is simply fortuitous."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and movement of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in these processes. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher mobility and stability of the oxygen vacancies, thus influencing the reaction rate and selectivity.

[1] "It is striking that the lowest Rp i.e., 0.23 is appreciably smaller than the value i.e., 0.29 obtained following optimization of only the atoms considered in the original structure determination."
[2] "As evidenced by the decrease in Rp/2, it is clear that initially the fits improve considerably as the number of layers optimized increases."
[3] "Beyond six optimized layers equivalent to an 11-trilayer calculated slab there is no further significant improvement in either Rp or 2, i.e., the fits become converged as regards this parameter."
[4] "As regards precision, one further point to glean from Table I is that the LEED-IV error bars increase much more rapidly with depth than those associated with the SXRD measurements."

The study confirms the integrity of the previously reported optimized geometries of TiO2(110)(11) through re-analysis of low-energy electron-diffraction (LEED) and surface x-ray diffraction (SXRD) data. The researchers perform structural optimizations as a function of depth into the selvedge to validate the experimental structure determinations. The analysis demonstrates that the atomic displacements determined from LEED measurements are not compromised by the limited number of optimized atom positions, contrary to previous suggestions. The results support the essential validity of the previous LEED and SXRD structure determinations.

[1] "This work is performed in response to ab initio density-functional theory calculations that suggest that the atomic displacements determined from low-energy electron-diffraction measurements may be compromised by the limited number of optimized atom positions."
[2] "It is concluded that this agreement is a result of virtually the same atoms being optimized in both the five- trilayer slab total energy minimization and the LEED-IV structure determination, as can be discerned from Figs. 1a and 1b, remembering that a mirror plane is imposed in Fig. 1a."
[3] "As evidenced by the decrease in Rp/2, it is clear that initially the fits improve considerably as the number of layers optimized increases. Beyond six optimized layers equivalent to an 11-trilayer calculated slab there is no further significant improvement in either Rp or 2, i.e., the fits become converged as regards this parameter."
[4] "These two points are demonstrated graphically in Fig. 2b, which displays the displacement of two surface atoms, O1 bridging oxygen and Ti2 fivefold titanium, as a function of the number of optimized layers."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) from the oxide surface to the reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power because it requires less energy for oxygen vacancies to be formed and thus facilitates the reaction more efficiently.

[2] "Focusing on the experimentally derived data, it can be seen that for both O1 and Ti2 displacement becomes almost constant for three-layer optimization and beyond."
[3] "Moreover, it is almost certain that the reported7,8 coincidence of the five-trilayer ab initio DFT geometry and the original LEED-IV solution three-layer optimization shown in Fig. 2b is simply for- tuitous."
[4] "While it is clear one can simply translate atomic displacements into bond lengths and angles, we do agree that for some purposes explicit listing of these latter parameters would give more immediate insight."

The study reanalyzed LEED-IV and SXRD data to confirm the integrity of the previously reported optimized geometries for TiO2(110)(11). The researchers aimed to address concerns raised by ab initio density-functional theory calculations suggesting that the atomic displacements determined from LEED-IV measurements might be compromised due to the limited number of optimized atom positions. By performing structural optimizations as a function of depth into the selvedge, the study validates the previous experimental structure determinations. The analysis demonstrates that the optimized atomic displacements determined from LEED-IV data are reliable, and there is a high degree of agreement between the LEED-IV and SXRD structures, confirming the essential validity of both methods. Additionally, bond lengths and bond angles were provided for selected atoms to offer a more physically relevant perspective on the structure.

The analysis demonstrates that increasing the number of optimized layers initially leads to a considerable improvement in the fit quality, as measured by the Pendry reliability factor Rp. The lowest Rp value, 0.23, is notably lower than the value of 0.29 obtained when only considering the atoms from the original structure determination. However, beyond six optimized layers, equivalent to an 11-trilayer slab, there is no further significant improvement in Rp or the chi-squared value (χ2), indicating that the fits have become converged regarding these parameters.

分析表明，随着优化层数量的增加，初始的拟合质量显著提高，用Pendry可靠性因子Rp衡量。最低的Rp值为0.23，远低于仅考虑原始结构确定中所考虑原子时得到的值0.29。然而，在优化了六个层之后，相当于一个计算得到的11层三明治结构，无论是Rp还是χ2值都没有进一步的显著改善，这表明在这些参数方面，拟合已经收敛。
