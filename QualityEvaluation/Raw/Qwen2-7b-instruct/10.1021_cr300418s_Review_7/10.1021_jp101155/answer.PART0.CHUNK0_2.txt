1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an adsorbed oxygen species on the oxide surface. This species is then abstracted by a hydrogen atom, leading to the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically lead to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the increased stability and reactivity of the oxygen vacancy.

1. 马斯-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面吸附氧物种的操作进行。然后，通过一个氢原子将其抽象，导致形成氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。较高的ΔEv值通常会导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为氧空位的稳定性和反应性更强。
