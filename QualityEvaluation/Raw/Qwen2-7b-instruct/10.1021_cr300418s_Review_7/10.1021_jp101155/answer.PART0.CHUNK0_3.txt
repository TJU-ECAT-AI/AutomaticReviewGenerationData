[1] "Defining the Role of Excess Electrons in the Surface Chemistry of TiO2"
[2] "In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the sequential addition of oxygen atoms to the reactant molecule, facilitated by the presence of excess electrons on the oxide surface."
[3] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates higher reactivity and efficiency in the oxidation process."

1. In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by sequentially adding oxygen atoms to the reactant molecule, which is facilitated by the presence of excess electrons on the oxide surface.
2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest higher reactivity and efficiency in the oxidation process.
