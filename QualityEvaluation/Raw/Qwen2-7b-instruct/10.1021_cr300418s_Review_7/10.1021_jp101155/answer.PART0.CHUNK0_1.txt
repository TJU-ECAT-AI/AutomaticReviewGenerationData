The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an active oxygen species, which is typically an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, leading to a more active surface and enhanced oxidizing capability.
