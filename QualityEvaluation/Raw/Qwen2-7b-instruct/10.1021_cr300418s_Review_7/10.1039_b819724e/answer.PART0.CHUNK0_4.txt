[1] "The rutile TiO2(110) surface has been doped with sub-monolayer metallic Cr, which oxidises and donates charge to specific surface Ti ions."
[2] "X-Ray and ultra violet photoemission spectroscopy and first principles density functional theory with Hubbard U are used to assign the oxidation states of Cr and surface Ti and we find that Cr2+ forms on bridging oxygen ions and a 5-fold coordinated surface Ti atom is reduced to Ti3+."
[3] "By exposing this structure to oxygen we re-oxidise all of the Ti to Ti4+ through a strongly preferred adsorption of oxygen only on the Cr species."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Cr is adsorbed on the rutile TiO2(110) surface and forms Cr2+ ions, which donate charge to specific surface Ti ions, reducing them to Ti3+. When oxygen is exposed to the doped surface, the Ti3+ ions are re-oxidized to Ti4+, and the Cr species are further oxidized.

Cr在锐钛矿TiO2(110)表面吸附并形成Cr2+离子，向特定表面Ti离子捐赠电荷，将它们还原为Ti3+。当氧气暴露于掺杂的表面时，Ti3+离子被重新氧化为Ti4+，Cr物种进一步被氧化。
