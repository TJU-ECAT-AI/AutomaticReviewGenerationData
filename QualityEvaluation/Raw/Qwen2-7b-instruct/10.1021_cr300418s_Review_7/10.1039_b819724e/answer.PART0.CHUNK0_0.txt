[1] "We find that adsorbed Cr is oxidised to Cr2+ reducing one 5-fold coordinated surface Ti ion to Ti3+ while the remaining electron is delocalised over neighbouring surface Ti."
[2] "Upon exposing the doped surface to oxygen, both experiment and modelling show that the Ti3+ defect is preferentially re-oxidised and electrons are withdrawn from the surface region, with adsorbed Cr further oxidised to Cr(III)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When oxygen is exposed to the doped surface, the ΔEv facilitates the preferential re-oxidation of the Ti3+ defect, leading to the withdrawal of electrons from the surface region. This process further oxidizes the adsorbed Cr to Cr(III).

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运行。氧的形成所需的能量影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当氧气暴露于掺杂表面上时，ΔEv促进Ti3+缺陷的优先再氧化，导致从表面区域抽出电子。这一过程进一步将吸附的Cr氧化为Cr(III)。
