[1] "In this paper we investigate, for the first time, controlled doping of the TiO2(110) surface with sub-monolayer Cr coverages, using photoemission spectroscopy in parallel with large-scale DFT + U calculations."
[2] "The most stable adsorption site is that where the Cr atom adsorbs bridging two bridging oxygen atoms and is displaced along h1 10i, the so called horizontal interstital site."
[3] "Upon exposing the doped surface to oxygen, both experiment and modelling show that the Ti3+ defect is preferentially re-oxidised and electrons are withdrawn from the surface region, with adsorbed Cr further oxidised to Cr(III)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen is abstracted from the surface and then re-adsorbed in an oxidized state. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial as it determines the energy barrier for oxygen to detach from the surface and re-attach in a more oxidized state, thus influencing both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作，其中氧从表面被抽离然后以更氧化的状态重新吸附。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）至关重要，因为它决定了氧脱离表面并以更氧化状态重新附着的能量壁垒，从而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
