[1] "We find that Cr2+ forms on bridging oxygen ions and a 5-fold coordinated surface Ti atom is reduced to Ti3+."
[2] "Upon adsorption of Cr atoms, the relative intensity of the Ti4+ peak is reduced and the intensity in the Ti3+ shoulder increases."
[3] "The computed spin magnetization gives a 3d4 electronic configuration on Cr, with the four 3d electrons unpaired, so that upon adsorption Cr is oxidised to Cr2+ , with the 4s electron and a 3d electron transferred to the surface."
[4] "By exposing this structure to oxygen we re-oxidise all of the Ti to Ti4 + through a strongly preferred adsorption of oxygen only on the Cr species."
[5] "The adsorption of oxygen results in an energy gain of 1.88 eV when adsorbed at Cr."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. As mentioned in the literature, when Cr is adsorbed on the TiO2(110) surface, it forms a Cr2+ ion, which reduces a 5-fold coordinated surface Ti atom to Ti3+. This reduction leads to structural distortions in neighboring O atoms. When the doped surface is exposed to oxygen, the Ti3+ defect is preferentially re-oxidized, and electrons are withdrawn from the surface region. Simultaneously, the adsorbed Cr further oxidizes to Cr3+. The adsorption of oxygen at Cr leads to an energy gain of 1.88 eV, contributing to the re-oxidation of the surface and the formation of a peroxo (O2 2) species.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来操作。氧空位形成的能量影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。如文献所述，当Cr吸附在TiO2(110)表面上时，它形成一个Cr2+离子，并将表面5配位的Ti原子还原为Ti3+。这种还原导致相邻O原子的几何结构变形。当镀层表面暴露于氧气时，Ti3+缺陷被优先氧化，从表面区域抽出电子。同时，吸附在Cr上的Cr进一步氧化为Cr3+。氧气吸附在Cr上导致1.88 eV的能量增加，有助于表面的重新氧化并形成过氧（O2 2）物种。
