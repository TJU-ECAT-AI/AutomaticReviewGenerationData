[1] "The rutile TiO2(110) surface has been doped with sub-monolayer metallic Cr, which oxidises and donates charge to specific surface Ti ions."
[2] "Upon dosing with 1/8 ML Cr ad-atoms two clear and well separated states are introduced in the band gap. The first, at B1 eV, is a Ti defect state of 3d character and is a result of the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ ."
[3] "Exposing this structure to oxygen we re-oxidise all of the Ti to Ti4 + through a strongly preferred adsorption of oxygen only on the Cr species."
[4] "The adsorption of oxygen results in an energy gain of 1.88 eV when adsorbed at Cr."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically signifies a more stable OV, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to the increased availability of active sites for oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物表面的氧空位（OV）形成而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时起着关键作用。较高的ΔEv通常意味着更稳定的OV，这导致增强的催化活性和氧化能力，因为提供了更多的活性位点进行氧化反应。
