[1] "Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies,17 such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material."
[2] "The presence of this structure, following typical UHV surface preparation compris- ing inert gas ion bombardment and annealing cycles, has been confirmed experimentally using various quantitative probes of surface crystallography.1218"
[3] "The key result was a switch from bright spots being adsorbed on the bright rows at r200 K to bright spots appearing between bright rows at B290 K."
[4] "One of the keys to distinguishing OHb from Ob-vacs was suggested by studies in which the STM tip was scanned over the TiO2(110) surface at a raised voltage of +3 V. Type-A defects were removed from the surface and interpreted as tip-induced refilling of Ob-vacs by Diebold et al.70 and as tip-induced removal of hydrogen from OHb by Suzuki et al.63"
[5] "Wendt et al.67,68 propose that immediately after water molecules dissociate, the two resulting OHb sit next to each other in the [001] direction. In such a configuration, individual OHb from the pair are difficult to resolve in STM images and each OHb pair therefore appears as a single feature."

1. The drive to understand and improve the chemical reactivity of TiO2 stems from its applications in various technologies, including solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing, medical implantation, and corrosion protection.

2. The structure of the ideal bulk-terminated TiO2(110)11 surface, featuring bridging oxygens (Ob), 5-fold titaniums (Ti5c), and in-plane oxygens at the solid-vacuum interface, has been confirmed experimentally through various quantitative surface crystallography methods.

3. Water dissociates only at oxygen vacancies (Ob-vacs) on the TiO2(110) surface, with the hydrogen atom splitting off and leaving a bridging hydroxyl group (OHb) at the vacancy.

4. The assignment of type-A defects as oxygen vacancies (Ob-vacs) was clarified through studies that showed their removal upon applying a voltage of +3 V to the STM tip, as opposed to the interpretation of these defects as hydrogen-bound hydroxyl groups by other researchers.

5. Immediately after water molecules dissociate, the two resulting OHb groups tend to sit next to each other in the [001] direction, making it difficult to distinguish them in STM images as separate entities.

1. 对于太阳能电池、催化、气体传感、医疗植入和腐蚀保护等领域中TiO2表面化学的重要性，推动了对其化学活性进行深入探究和提升的强烈需求。

2. 通过各种定量表面晶体学方法证实了理想晶面终止的TiO2(110)11表面的结构，包括桥氧（Ob）、五配位钛（Ti5c）以及与固体-真空界面相连的平面氧原子。

3. 水在TiO2(110)表面上仅在氧空位（Ob-vac）处发生分解，氢原子分裂并留下一个桥接羟基（OHb）在空位上。

4. 通过对STM探针在加高电压（+3 V）的情况下扫描TiO2(110)表面的研究，确定了这些缺陷可被去除，并且解释为氧空位（Ob-vac），而其他研究则将其解释为氢结合的羟基团。

5. 在水分子分解后，两个形成的OHb倾向于彼此相邻地处于[001]方向，这使得在STM图像中难以分辨它们作为单独的实体。
