[1] "The role of defects such as O vacancies has now been evaluated in exquisite detail and it is clear that they play a crucial role in surface reactions."
[2] "It has already proved possible to measure the 15 fs lifetime of a wet electron state on TiO2(110) using two-photon photoemission."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These oxygen vacancies provide active sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which then undergo a series of redox reactions to form reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more energetically favorable process for oxygen vacancy formation, leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power. This is because a reduced energy barrier allows for easier oxygen vacancy creation, facilitating more efficient adsorption and redox reactions of oxygen molecules on the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化空位（氧空位）在氧化物表面的评估来运行。这些氧空位为氧分子的吸附提供了活性位点，然后进行一系列还原氧化反应以形成活性氧物种，如羟基自由基。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧空位形成更有利于的过程，导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。这是因为降低的能量壁垒允许更容易地形成氧空位，从而促进表面更有效的氧分子吸附和氧化还原反应。
