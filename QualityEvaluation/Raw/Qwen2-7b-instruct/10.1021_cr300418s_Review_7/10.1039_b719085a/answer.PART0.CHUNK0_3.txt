1. TiO2 surface chemistry plays a crucial role in various technologies such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing, medical implantation, and corrosion protection, driving efforts to enhance its chemical reactivity.

2. The rutile TiO2(110) surface is the most studied single crystal surface for TiO2, serving as a model for researchers exploring diverse important topics including surface chemistry at both regular terrace sites and defects.

3. The chemical reactivity of TiO2(110) is discussed in detail in this critical review, focusing on four molecules: water, oxygen, carboxylic acids, and alcohols.

4. A switch in the STM images was observed from bright spots adsorbed on the bright rows at room temperature to spots appearing between the bright rows at 290 K, indicating the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs.

5. The DFT simulations of STM images suggest that Ob-vacs are brighter than OHb, providing evidence for their distinct assignment.

6. STM enables the dynamic imaging of water dissociation in Ob-vacs, allowing for direct observation of the chemical reactions.

7. Over the years, the assignment of type-A defects has been reversed, indicating that they are actually OHb rather than Ob-vacs as previously thought.

8. The assignment of type-A defects as OHb is based on the observation that they can be removed from the surface by electrical pulses at a raised voltage, unlike Ob-vacs.

9. A switch in the STM images was observed from bright spots adsorbed on the bright rows at room temperature to spots appearing between the bright rows at 290 K, indicating the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs.
