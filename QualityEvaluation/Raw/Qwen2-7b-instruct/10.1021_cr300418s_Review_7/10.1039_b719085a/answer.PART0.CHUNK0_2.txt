[1] "Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies, such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material."
[2] "In this critical review, we are not only concerned with the chemistry of TiO2(110), but also that of the reconstructed 12 phase(s)."
[3] "The bridging oxygen atom (O(1) in Fig. 2) being of primary concern. This situation has motivated a recent re-examination of the relaxation of the TiO2(110)11 surface, employing a number of quantitative structural probes, including a more recent SXRD study."
[4] "Comparing experiment with first-principles calculations of the geometric structure of TiO2(110)11, these two strands of effort are apparently beginning to converge."
[5] "In addition to surface reduction, annealing a TiO2(110) sample in UHV leads to substoichiometry in the bulk, which is indicated by changes in sample colour."
[6] "Throughout this review, the coverage of molecules adsorbed on TiO2(110) will be given in monolayers (ML), where 1 ML corresponds to one adsorbate per primitive surface unit cell."
[7] "Water dissociation Nearly all experimental studies of water adsorption on TiO2(110)11 indicate that water dissociates only at Ob-vacs, as shown in the reaction scheme in Fig. 7."
[8] "Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra of water on TiO2(110) give peaks at B163 K, B175 K, B265 K, and B490 K, as shown in Fig. 8."
[9] "When the surface was isotopically enriched with 18O before exposure to H216O, H218O was preferentially desorbed at B490 K."
[10] "By imaging the reaction dynamically, STM has the power to directly follow the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs."
[11] "Evidence accumulated over the past few years, however, reverses the assignment of type-A defects by Schaub et al."
[12] "Returning to Fig. 11c: because STM images were recorded from the same area before and after exposure to water, it can be seen that some of the new OHb reside in positions previously taken by Ob-vacs."
[13] "The unambiguous assignment of OHb and Ob-vacs in STM images enabled point defects in NC-AFM images of TiO2(110) to be identified definitively as well."
[14] "Alongside this rich thermal chemistry, a series of photoreaction and photodesorption experiments have been performed."
[15] "By annealing TiO2(110) samples in pressures of O2, the reoxidation of these interstitial ions has been stunningly captured in a series of high temperature STM and low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) experiments."
[16] "The same cyclic growth can be seen on a much larger scale in the series of LEEM images shown in Fig. 19, which were recorded at 820 K and 1.3 106 mbar O2."
[17] "For low temperatures, this is presumably because the thermal energy supplied is insufficient to overcome the barriers to reaction, whereas at high temperatures the surface growth is limited by the low residency time of the O2 molecules at the surface."
[18] "Importantly, Li et al. also found 18O uptake to be faster for more reduced crystals (as judged qualitatively from their color)."
[19] "Li et al. also found 18O incorporation at the surfaces, finding a maximum rate for 18O incorporation at B669 K."
