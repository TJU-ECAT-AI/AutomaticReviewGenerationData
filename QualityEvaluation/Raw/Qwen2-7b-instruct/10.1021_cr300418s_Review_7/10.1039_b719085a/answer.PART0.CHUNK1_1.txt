[1] "Interest- ingly, the location of the proton (H+ (ads)) resulting from HCOOH dissociation was also determined in this study. It was found to be attached to a bridging oxygen, forming a bridging hydroxyl (OHb)."

[5] "From reflection absorp- tion infra-red spectroscopy (RAIRS)116 and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS),121 it was concluded that this second formate comprises B3040% of a saturated (21) overlayer, and is oriented with its molecular plane aligned along the [1 10] direction, i.e. it is azimuthally rotated by 901 with respect to Sayago et al.s formate configuration."

1. The proton (H+ (ads)) resulting from the dissociation of HCOOH is found to be attached to a bridging oxygen, forming a bridging hydroxyl (OHb).

2. Formic acid is concluded not to adsorb on the simple 12 phase features in an STM study on a TiO2(110) surface.

3. Any long-range (21) order is lost by approximately 350 K.

4. The effort in studying formic acid reactions on TiO2(110) can be divided into steady-state conditions with a flux of formic acid and studies of adsorbed formic acid/formate overlayers as a function of substrate temperature.

5. The second formate species comprises around 30-40% of a saturated (21) overlayer and is oriented with its molecular plane aligned along the [1 10] direction, which is 901 degrees rotated from Sayago et al.'s formate configuration.

1. 研究发现，由HCOOH分解产生的质子（H+（ads））附着在桥氧上，形成桥接羟基（OHb）。

2. STM研究得出结论，formic酸在具有简单12相特征的TiO2（110）表面不吸附。

3. 大约在350 K时，任何长程（21）顺序丢失。

4. 对于在TiO2（110）表面上的formic酸反应的研究工作可以分为两种情况：一种是在固定温度下使用TiO2（110）样本在流体中的测量（即稳态条件），另一种是研究吸附在样本表面温度下的formic酸/形成物覆盖层。

5. 第二种formate物种占饱和（21）覆盖层的大约30-40%，其分子平面沿[1 10]方向排列，与Sayago等人的formate配置相比旋转了901度。
