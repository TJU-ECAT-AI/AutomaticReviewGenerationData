[1] "Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies,17 such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material."
[2] "The presence of this structure, following typical UHV surface preparation compris- ing inert gas ion bombardment and annealing cycles, has been confirmed experimentally using various quantitative probes of surface crystallography.1218"
[3] "The key result was a switch from bright spots being adsorbed on the bright rows at r200 K to bright spots appearing between bright rows at B290 K."
[4] "One of the keys to distinguishing OHb from Ob-vacs was suggested by studies in which the STM tip was scanned over the TiO2(110) surface at a raised voltage of +3 V. Type-A defects were removed from the surface and interpreted as tip-induced refilling of Ob-vacs by Diebold et al.70 and as tip-induced removal of hydrogen from OHb by Suzuki et al.63"
[5] "Wendt et al.67,68 propose that immediately after water molecules dissociate, the two resulting OHb sit next to each other in the [001] direction. In such a configuration, individual OHb from the pair are difficult to resolve in STM images and each OHb pair therefore appears as a single feature."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These oxygen vacancies provide active sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which then undergo a series of redox reactions to form reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more energetically favorable process for oxygen vacancy formation, leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power. This is because a reduced energy barrier allows for easier oxygen vacancy creation, facilitating more efficient adsorption and redox reactions of oxygen molecules on the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化空位（氧空位）在氧化物表面的评估来运行。这些氧空位为氧分子的吸附提供了活性位点，然后进行一系列还原氧化反应以形成活性氧物种，如羟基自由基。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧空位形成更有利于的过程，导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。这是因为降低的能量壁垒允许更容易地形成氧空位，从而促进表面更有效的氧分子吸附和氧化还原反应。

The proton (H+ (ads)) resulting from the dissociation of HCOOH is found to be attached to a bridging oxygen, forming a bridging hydroxyl (OHb). On the TiO2(110) surface, the dehydration reaction is dominant at substrate temperatures around 4500 K, while at lower temperatures, dehydration is the prevailing process. In the representation of the adsorbate, the light spheres in the rings depict nitrogen atoms, the dark spheres are carbon atoms, the smallest spheres are hydrogen atoms, and the largest are oxygen atoms.

从研究中得知，HCOOH 分解产生的质子（H+ (ads)）附着在桥接氧上，形成桥接羟基（OHb）。在TiO2(110)表面上，4500 K左右的温度下，脱水反应占主导地位，而较低温度下则是脱水过程占优势。在吸附物的表示中，环中的浅色球体代表氮原子，深色球体是碳原子，最小的球体是氢原子，最大的是氧原子。

[1] "Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies,17 such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material."
[2] "The presence of this structure, following typical UHV surface preparation compris- ing inert gas ion bombardment and annealing cycles, has been confirmed experimentally using various quantitative probes of surface crystallography.1218"
[3] "Agreeing is most impressive for the quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED-IV)15 and the latest SXRD18 experiments, as many of the atomic displacements have been determined with high precision (the error bars associated with the medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and photoelectron diffraction (PhD) structures are typically somewhat larger)."
[4] "It is concluded that the charge is distributed across several Ti atoms, both surface and subsurface, with the majority being located on a second layer Ti (Ti(3) in Fig. 2)."
[5] "The key result was a switch from bright spots being adsorbed on the bright rows at r200 K to bright spots appearing between bright rows at B290 K."
[6] "Only Ab defects could be removed in this way and this was used as a means to distinguish the two types of defects."
[7] "It was therefore concluded that whilst the additional molecularly adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in adjacent sites."
