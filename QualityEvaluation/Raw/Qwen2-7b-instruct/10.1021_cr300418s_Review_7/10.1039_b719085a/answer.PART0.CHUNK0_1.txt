[1] "Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies,17 such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material."
[2] "In order to address this, considerable research effort has been directed at model single crystal surfaces of TiO2. Particular attention has been given to the rutile TiO2(110) surface because it is the most stable face of TiO2."
[3] "To date, rutile TiO2(110) is the most studied single crystal TiO2 surface. Indeed, its 11 termination has emerged as the prototypical metal oxide surface for fundamental studies."
[4] "In this critical review, we are not only concerned with the chemistry of TiO2(110), but also that of the reconstructed 12 phase(s)."
[5] "For TiO2(110), fortunately, many structural aspects are well characterised, in particular for the 11 phase."
[6] "The presence of this structure, following typical UHV surface preparation compris- ing inert gas ion bombardment and annealing cycles, has been confirmed experimentally using various quantitative probes of surface crystallography."
[7] "None of the latter work replicates the relaxation of the bridging oxygen (O(1)) towards the bulk determined in ref. 12, rather all find that the oxygen"
[8] "Comparing experiment with first-principles calculations of the geometric structure of TiO2(110)11, these two strands of effort are apparently beginning to converge."
[9] "The real value of these probes is the visualisation of surface imperfections,such as step edges, which are not normally accessible to spatially integrating diffraction/scattering techniques."
[10] "Of par- ticular importance, as regards surface chemistry, are bridging oxygen vacancies (Ob-vacs), which are the primary point defects on this surface."
[11] "Following standard substrate prepara- tion in UHV, several percent of bridging oxygen atoms are missing;28 the concentration of Ob-vacs can be controlled through variation of the annealling temperature."
[12] "The real value of these probes is the visualisation of surface imperfections,such as step edges, which are not normally accessible to spatially integrating diffraction/scattering techniques."
