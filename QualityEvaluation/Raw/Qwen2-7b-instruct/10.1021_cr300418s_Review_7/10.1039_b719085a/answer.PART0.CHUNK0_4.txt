[1] "Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies,17 such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material."
[2] "The presence of this structure, following typical UHV surface preparation compris- ing inert gas ion bombardment and annealing cycles, has been confirmed experimentally using various quantitative probes of surface crystallography.1218"
[3] "Agreeing is most impressive for the quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED-IV)15 and the latest SXRD18 experiments, as many of the atomic displacements have been determined with high precision (the error bars associated with the medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and photoelectron diffraction (PhD) structures are typically somewhat larger)."
[4] "It is concluded that the charge is distributed across several Ti atoms, both surface and subsurface, with the majority being located on a second layer Ti (Ti(3) in Fig. 2)."
[5] "The key result was a switch from bright spots being adsorbed on the bright rows at r200 K to bright spots appearing between bright rows at B290 K."
[6] "Only Ab defects could be removed in this way and this was used as a means to distinguish the two types of defects."
[7] "It was therefore concluded that whilst the additional molecularly adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in adjacent sites."
