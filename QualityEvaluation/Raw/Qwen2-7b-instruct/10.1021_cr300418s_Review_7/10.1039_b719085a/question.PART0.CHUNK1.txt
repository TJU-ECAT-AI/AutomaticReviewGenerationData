HCOOH(g) - [HCOO] (ads) + H+ (ads) (1) These chemisorbed formate species ([HCOO] (ads)) saturate at approximately 0.5 ML (where 1 ML corresponds to one formate per surface 5-fold Ti), forming an ordered (21) overlayer.114 At lower formate coverage, a local c(42) order has been observed with STM.118 To gain further insight into the acid dissociation reaction,several groups have probed the geometry of the surface formate moiety.116,117,119122 Of these investigations the most detailed is a chemical-state specific scanned-energy mode PhD study by Sayago et al.,122 which quantitatively determines both bonding site and adsorbate orientation. It is concluded that formate binds to the surface through both of its oxygens to two adjacent five-fold surface titanium (Ti5c) atoms, so that its molecular plane is aligned with the [001] azimuth, i.e. it lies parallel to the rows of bridging oxygens (Ob). A schematic diagram of this local adsorption geometry is shown in Fig. 21,including values for pertinent structural parameters. Interest- ingly, the location of the proton (H+ (ads)) resulting from HCOOH dissociation was also determined in this study. It was found to be attached to a bridging oxygen, forming a bridging hydroxyl (OHb).
Other experiments,116,117,119121 as well as theoretical calcu- lations,123127 support the formate adsorption geometry de- termined by Sayago et al. (Type A in Fig. 22). In addition,some measurements suggest the presence of a second formate species on TiO2(110)11.116,117,121,128 From reflection absorp- tion infra-red spectroscopy (RAIRS)116 and near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS),121 it was concluded that this second formate comprises B3040% of a saturated (21) overlayer, and is oriented with its molecular plane aligned along the [1 10] direction, i.e. it is azimuthally rotated by 901 with respect to Sayago et al.s formate configuration. It was suggested in ref. 116 that this species is Type B in Fig. 22,which arises through reaction of formic acid with Ob-vacs,generated during the formation of Type A formate. This Type B configuration, which is coordinated via one O to the Ob-vac and through its other O atom to an adjacent Ti5c site, was first proposed by Wang et al. on the basis of ab initio calculations.123 Sayago et al. found no evidence for the second formate species, although they did consider such a possibility during their structure determination.122 Long-range order is not a prerequisite for application of PhD, and so a minority formate species, if present in sufficient concentration, would emerge Fig. 21 Schematic diagram of the local formate adsorption geometry,indicating various best-fit structural parameters derived from PhD.122 2340  Chem.

Consequently, there appears to be a significant disparity between the PhD, and the RAIRS and NEXAFS studies.116,121 However, as indicated in ref. 122, it may merely be that the population of Type B formate is minimal in the PhD study due to differences in experimental conditions, e.g. sample preparation/history, amount of formic acid dosed, and the precise substrate temperature during exposure. Recent work by Aizawa et al.129 supports this hypothesis. They acquired STM images from a TiO2(110)11 surface exposed to formic acid and then annealed to 350 K for 400 min. Careful analysis of the data indicated three different formate surface geometries, Type A, Type B, and Type C in Fig. 22, which were present on the surface in a ratio of 10 : 7 : 3.
Type C formate is surface bonded through only one O atom,which fills an Ob-vac. Given these results, it is plausible that the second formate species observed in RAIRS and NEXAFS is a result of formic acid exposure being conducted with the substrate somewhat above room temperature. We note that STM images recorded by Bowker et al.128 following formic acid dosing at room temperature are also suggestive of a second formate species, but at a concentration of only B1% of the ordered (21)-[HCOO] overlayer.
In contrast to this extensive effort on the 11 phase, there has been very limited activity focusing on the adsorption of formic acid on reconstructed TiO2(110). Bennett et al.130 have employed STM to examine formic acid adsorption at room temperature on the x-linked 12 phase. They found that formic acid binds, presumably as formate, preferentially to the x-links, although it does also adsorb in between the x-links,forming a rather disordered overlayer. In another STM study25 on a TiO2(110) surface exhibiting strands of the simple 12 phase, it was concluded that formic acid does not adsorb on these features. Bennett et al. used this result as evidence that the simple and x-linked 12 phases have different struc- tures. However, given that more recent work suggests that these two phases both consist of Ti2O3 added rows (see section 2), it is more likely that this difference in surface reactivity is due to variation in experimental procedure. For example, Bennett et al.130 exposed the surface to B240500 L of formic acid, whereas an exposure of 3 L was employed in ref. 25.
5.1.2
Thermal decomposition. Aizawa et al.s STM study129 was motivated by interest in understanding the thermal de- composition of formic acid on TiO2(110)11 beyond surface formate formation. This topic has been a focus of attention for a number of years, and quite detailed insight has been gained through a combination of experiment and theory. The former effort can be separated into two categories, namely measure- ments performed with the TiO2(110) sample at fixed tempera- ture in a flux of formic acid (i.e. steady-state conditions) and studies of adsorbed formic acid/formate overlayers as a func- tion of substrate temperature.
Under steady-state conditions, Onishi et al.114,131 conclude that there are two decomposition channels for formic acid on TiO2(110)11, i.e.
HCOOH(g) - CO(g) + H2O(g) (dehydration) (2) and HCOOH(g) - CO2(g) + H2(g) (dehydrogenation) (3) They have found that the dehydration reaction is dominant at substrate temperatures 4500 K, whereas at lower tempera- tures dehydration prevails. A similar result emerged from a comparable study by Wang et al.132 In sharp contrast, Bowker et al.128 found no evidence for the dehydrogenation reaction in their steady-state measurements, observing only dehydra- tion. There is no obvious explanation for this discrepancy,although it has been suggested it might be due to differences in either formic acid partial pressure or surface structure.128,132 We note that Bowker et al.128 did observe formic acid dehydrogenation on a surface decorated with Pd nanoparticles.
As regards the evolution of formic acid/formate overlayers with temperature, it has been found that by approximately 350 K any long-range (21) order is lost.114 This disordering arises due to the formation of multiple formate bonding geometries,129 as discussed above, along with desorption of a proportion of the bound formate, which TPD shows comes off as formic acid,114,115,132 i.e.
[HCOO]
(ads) + H+ (ads) - HCOOH(g) (recombination) (4) Besides evidencing this recombination reaction, desorbed spe- cies observed in the TPD measurements also reveal surface formate decomposition processes; a list of the desorbed species and their desorption temperatures (TDs) found in the three TPD studies conducted to date114,115,132 is provided in Table 3.
In all of these studies, CO and H2O are both major products,suggesting that formic acid dehydration (reaction (2)) readily occurs under these conditions. Most simply, this reaction could proceed through fragmentation of the adsorbed formate,
[HCOO]
(ads) - CO(g) + OH (ads) (5) with the resulting hydroxyl species combining with the pre- viously dissociated acidic hydrogen (reaction (1)) to form water. Interestingly, however, although some water desorbs at approximately the same temperature as CO (TD B 560 K),the majority leaves the TiO2(110) surface at a significantly lower temperature (TD B 350440 K). On the basis that any CO formed would immediately desorb at these substrate temperatures,115 the lower temperature water TPD feature must arise from a process unrelated to formate decomposition (reaction (5)).

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online combination with HREELS and SSIMS,115 suggest that this water is produced through the following reaction: OHb
(ads) + OHb
(ads) - H2O(g) + O-vac (6) where the hydroxyl species are those formed upon dissociative adsorption of formic acid (reaction (1)). Given that these hydroxyl species are bridging hydroxyls,122 the O-vac in reac- tion (6) is almost certainly an Ob-vac, as illustrated in Fig. 23.
This deduction is supported by Bowker et al.s128 STM images from a formic acid exposed TiO2(110)11 surface annealed to 420 K, which indicate the presence of significant quantities of Ob-vacs. We note that when water is dosed onto a clean surface (see section 3.1) recombinative desorption (reaction (6)) occurs at B490 K, so it is not clear why these OHb species recombine at an apparently lower temperature here
(350440 K).
HREELS elastic peak measurements115 indicate that these Ob-vacs do not persist at higher temperatures, but are healed in coincidence with the onset of formate decomposition. This result suggests that defects of this type are integral to the decomposition chemistry of formic acid on TiO2(110)11, i.e. surface formate species interact directly with Ob-vacs during decomposition. Accordingly, Wang et al.132 have proposed that formate decomposition is initiated by the following step,
[HCOO]
(ads) + Ob-vac - [HCO] (ads) + Ob (7) They suggest that CO(g) is then generated by loss of hydrogen from the surface formyl species ([HCO]). In addition, this reaction also explains the presence of formaldehyde (H2CO) in the list of desorbed species in Table 3, as it can easily be formed by combining formyl with a surface hydroxyl hydro- gen. (We note that as a consequence of reaction (7) formate oxygen should be incorporated into the TiO2(110) surface, and that this process has been validated by Henderson.115) A more complete description of the mechanism of formic acid decomposition to form CO(g), along with H2O (i.e. dehydration) has been put forward in the recent study by Aizawa et al.,129 who have used both STM and ab initio modelling. As already highlighted, these researchers image three formate geometries at a substrate temperature of 350 K, namely Type A, Type B, and Type C in Fig. 22. The latter two configurations involve the interaction of formate with Ob-vacs, again suggesting a role for these defects in formate decomposition. This possibility was addressed by acquisition of consecutive STM images from the same area,enabling the visualisation of dynamic processes, including conversion between different formate geometries and formate decomposition. From such images it was determined, as shown in Fig. 24, that Type C formate, which is bound in a monodentate geometry plugging an Ob-vac, decomposes. This result is consistent with Wang et al.s proposal outlined above,132 as Type C formate can be considered to be essen- tially equivalent to the products of reaction (7). From these Table 3 Desorbed species and their desorption temperatures from three separate TPD experiments114,115,132 performed on TiO2(110)11 exposed to formic acid (HCOOH or DCOOD). Onishi et al.114 acquired their data following formation of a (21) formate overlayer at 230 K. Wang et al.s data132 were recorded after a saturation exposure at room temperature. Except for the values for CO2, the entries for Hendersons work115 are for a substrate (T B 100 K) exposed to sufficient formic acid to form approximately a monolayer;the CO2 data derive from a surface prepared similarly to that of Wang et al.

The bright protru- sion in image (a) at the intersection of the white lines is located centrally on an Ob row, and so is assigned to Type C formate. In image (b), recorded 80 s later, the brightness of this spot has significantly decreased, and it is laterally displaced along the row,which is taken as being indicative of the formate decomposing.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online results, previous work, and total energy calculations, Aizawa et al. conclude that formic acid dehydration proceeds thus, HCOOH(g) + Ob

(ads) (12) Given the weight of evidence to date, this is apparently a very reasonable mechanism, although further experimental effort to identify intermediates is required. Furthermore, this mechan- ism can operate either in the presence or absence of a partial pressure of formic acid, as no gas phase reactants are involved once the formic acid has initially adsorbed (reaction (8)).
Hence, it is applicable to both the steady-state and TPD-type (i.e. measurements performed in vacuum) experimental scenarios.
Table 3 shows that in addition to CO, CO2 desorbs from TiO2(110) during TPD measurements, which points to formic acid dehydrogenation (reaction (3)) occurring alongside dehy- dration. However, CO2 constitutes a relatively small propor- tion of the desorbed products, in particular in refs. 115 and 132, indicating that dehydrogenation is not favoured. This result is consistent with Onishi et al.s conclusion from steady- state measurements114,131 that the primary channel for dehy- drogenation involves a reaction between an adsorbed formate and an incoming gas phase formic acid molecule, which is not feasible under the conditions of the TPD experiments, i.e. there is no gas phase formic acid present. On this basis, various alternative routes, involving only adsorbed species, have been proposed, although not as yet rigorously tested, for the CO2 production observed during TPD.114,115,132 Details of the bimolecular dehydrogenation reaction, which occurs under steady-state conditions, involving [HCOO] (ads) and HCOOH(g), have very recently been explored theoretically by Uemura et al.133 They conclude that the dehydrogenation arises from the reaction between a Type A formate and a HCOOH molecule weakly bound to an adjacent Ti5c. Inter- estingly, unlike the dehydration mechanism, no defect site is required, merely a series of three Ti5cs.. Clearly, experimental work is required to test this theoretical prediction.
As regards decomposition of formic acid on reconstructed TiO2(110), Bennett et al.130 have performed a study on the x-linked 12 surface with STM. They acquired images from a surface decorated with adsorbed formate whilst ramping the temperature of the substrate. Further to reduction in adsor- bate density with increasing temperature, they observed for- mation of islands of 11 termination. They interpreted this phenomenon as being due to the reaction of mobile Tin+ interstitials with oxygen from decomposing formate, a process well-established for high temperature O2 exposure, as dis- cussed in section 4.4.
5.2
Other carboxylic acids
5.2.1
Adsorption. To date, experimental evidence (e.g. ref. 121, 134140) indicates that monocarboxylic acids (i.e. molecules with only one carboxyl group) typically mimic the room temperature adsorption of formic acid on TiO2(110)11,i.e. they form carboxylate moieties through acid hydrogen cleavage, and adopt a bonding geometry comparable to that displayed for formate in Fig. 21. Furthermore, smaller such species exhibit an ordered (21) overlayer at saturation (e.g. acetate ([H3CCOO]),134 propanoate ([H5C2COO]),121 and trimethylacetate ([(H3C)3CCOO]).136 Concerning the fate of the acidic hydrogen, it is generally believed that it bonds to a single bridging oxygen, forming OHb, as outlined in section 5.1.1 for formic acid. Lately,however, Lyubinetsky et al.141 have challenged this perception through STM and HREELS measurements from trimethyla- cetate (TMA) overlayers. They interpret their STM images of isolated TMA species as indicating that the acidic hydrogen attaches to a pair of bridging oxygens rather than a single one.This bonding geometry is illustrated in Fig. 25. Given the distance between the Obs (2.95 A ), such bonding would be rather weak, and so they propose that the hydrogen may dynamically oscillate between the two. Furthermore, they claim that the adjacent TMA is required to stabilise this geometry, and without it the hydrogen would simply bind to a single Ob, as observed following H2O dissociation at Ob-vacs (see section 3.1). HREELS data support their hypothesis in that the OH stretching mode expected for an OHb is not observed on a TiO2(110)11 surface saturated with TMA.This rather unexpected location for the acidic hydrogen, which Lyubinetsky et al. conclude may pertain to other carboxylate species on TiO2(110)11, requires further investigation.Studies have also been performed for the adsorption on TiO2(110)11 of molecules containing more than one carbox- yl group. In particular, there has been interest in bi-isonico- tinic acid (2,20-bipyridine-4,40-dicarboxylic acid), as it is the surface binding ligand in important organometallic dyes for TiO2-based solar cells. O 1s core level PES data, acquired from TiO2(110)11 with a submonolayer coverage of this molecule,indicate that both COOH groups are deprotonated and that all four oxygens are equivalent.142 To further elucidate the adsorption geometry of this bi-isonicotinate, N K-edge NEX- AFS measurements and theoretical modelling were under- taken.142,143 A ball and stick model of the most likely adsorption geometry is displayed in Fig. 26. Recently, the Fig. 25 Schematic diagram of Lyubinetsky et al.s proposed bonding geometry141 for the acidic hydrogen following dissociative adsorption of trimethylacetic acid on TiO2(110)11.This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2008 Chem.

Williamss group145 have stu- died room temperature adsorption of acetic acid on what we assume to be the simple 12 phase. They conclude from valence band PES data that surface acetate is formed, binding in a similar way to acetate on the 11 surface, but with a saturation coverage almost half that found on the 11. On the grounds that their surface was comprised of Ti2O3 added rows,they suggest that the acetate is adsorbed on Ti5c sites available in the troughs between added rows (see Fig. 5). The same group have also probed glycine (NH2CH2COOH) adsorption on an apparently similar 12 surface.146 In this case, PES data for a submonolayer coverage adsorbed at room temperature are interpreted as indicating molecular dissociation beyond simple acidic hydrogen loss. Specifically, they conclude that the primary species on the surface is the glycines carboxyl group, and that other components of the molecule have desorbed. Qiu and Barteau138 have employed STM to image glycine adsorption on x-linked TiO2(110)12. Similar to Bennett et al.s130 STM study of formic acid on x-linked 12, they found no ordering of the adsorbates. From these STM images it is not possible to address the extent, if any, of glycine decomposition.
5.2.2
Thermal decomposition. Investigations into the ther- mal decomposition of both acetic and trimethylacetic acids on TiO2(110)11 have been undertaken. Onishi et al.147 have examined the decomposition of the former by preparing a (21)[CH3COO] overlayer on TiO2(110), and then acquiring a series of STM images with the substrate maintained at a temperature of 510540 K. They observed mobile bright protrusions, which decreased in number with time. These entities were assigned to acetates undergoing decomposition.
Larger immobile features, which disappeared at higher tem- peratures, were ascribed to carbonaceous species resulting from secondary reactions. Core level PES data recorded by Idriss et al.148 also indicate the desorption of acetate in this temperature region.
The thermal decomposition of trimethylacetic acid has been studied by Henderson and co-workers,137 employing primarily
TPD. Observations largely mirror those found for formic acid
on TiO2(110)11, as detailed previously, although additional species are desorbed due to the presence of the (CH3)3Cgroup rather than H in formic acid. TPD of an ordered (21) TMA overlayer, formed at 300 K, shows that CO, H2O, and isobutene (i-C4H8) are all primary decomposi- tion products. CO and isobutene (i-C4H8) desorb at TD B 660 K, along with smaller quantities of H2O, methyl iso- propenyl ketone

and/or trimethylacetic acid. The primary H2O peak appears at TD B 460 K, and 18O labelling measurements indicate that reaction (6) is occurring, generating Ob-vacs. Also, analogous to the thermal decomposition of adsorbed formate, these Ob-vacs are healed during TMA decomposition. Hence, a mechanism similar to the one proposed by Aizawa et al.129 for the dehydration of formic acid (reactions (8)(12)) would be consistent with these results, with the primary products,namely CO and i-C4H8, being produced by:

5.2.3
Photodecomposition. Motivated by interest in photo- catalysis and related topics, effort has also been applied to understanding the photon induced chemistry of various or- ganics on TiO2(110). Here, such work on acetic acid and trimethylacetic acid is discussed, the photochemistry of alco- hols adsorbed on TiO2(110) being covered in section 6.2.3.
Beginning with acetic acid, Idriss et al.148 have examined the impact of UV radiation at room temperature on an overlayer of acetate on TiO2(110)11, both in UHV and in the presence O2 (B5  108 mbar). From C 1s core level PES spectra, it was concluded that under UHV conditions exposure to UV had no significant effect. In contrast, acetate was lost from the surface when UV illumination was performed in the partial pressure of O2. This result was interpreted as demonstrating that UV excitation of physisorbed O2 molecules, possibly to form O2
(ads) species, is required to initiate acetate decom- position/desorption;acetate decomposition is expected,although Idriss et al. do not provide any direct evidence of this process.
A more extensive study of UV photon induced chemistry has been conducted by Henderson and co-workers for tri- methylacetic acid on TiO2(110)11.136,149,150 First, it should be highlighted that, in contrast to Idriss et al.s result for adsorbed acetate,148 UV light does induce TMA decomposi- tion under UHV conditions. STM images directly show that TMA coverage is depleted upon exposure to UV photons (see Fig. 27),136 and evidence for UV driven TMA decomposition,rather than simple molecular desorption, emerges from the monitoring of gas phase species with a mass spectrometer Fig. 26 Ball and stick model of the most likely adsorption geometry for bi-isonicotinate on TiO2(110)11 emerging from ref. 142 and 143.
In the adsorbate, the light spheres in the rings are nitrogens, the dark spheres are carbons, the smallest spheres are hydrogens, and the largest are oxygen atoms. 2344  Chem. Soc.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online during irradiation. At substrate temperatures of 200 K and above, a significant amount of CO2 is found to be evolved during such measurements, along with, once the sample is at 300 K, isobutene (i-C4H8) and isobutane (i-C4H10). TPD, post UV exposure, suggests that these latter two species are derived from the thermal chemistry of adsorbed tert-butyl radicals ((CH3)3C), which are formed in tandem with CO2 as a result of the primary photon driven reaction, namely TMA CC bond cleavage giving rise to decarboxylation, i.e.
[(CH3)3CCOO]
(ads) + hn - CO2 + (CH3)3C (14) Almost certainly, as is discussed in refs. 136 and 149, the photon does not directly break the CC bond, but rather excites the TiO2 substrate, promoting an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, TiO2 + hn - e + h+ (15) The hole (h+) is consumed by interaction with TMA, extract- ing an electron from the p-system of the carboxylate group,which leads to the CC bond breaking. It is suggested that the electron (e) is trapped at the surface reducing Ti4+ to Ti3+,as is evidenced by EELS.136 Henderson and co-workers149 also found that the UV induced TMA decomposition reaction was quenched much more rapidly than expected on the basis of the remaining reactant molecule density. This phenomenon was concluded to be due to the accumulation of Ti3+ species in the surface region, as just outlined, which interact with remaining TMA species forming Ti3+TMA entities, which are inert as regards UV decomposition. Oxidation of these Ti3+ species by expos- ing the surface to O2 re-initiates the reaction.
Further work concerning the role of O2 in the photodecom- position of TMA is presented by Henderson and co-workers in ref. 150. More specifically, this study focuses upon the influ- ence of O2 on the thermal chemistry of the tert-butyl radical (reaction (14)). As indicated above, this species primarily desorbs from the surface as either isobutene or isobutane.
For a saturated (21) TMA overlayer, mass spectrometry demonstrates that, independent of O2 partial pressure, isobu- tene desorption is favoured upon initial UV illumination. The lack of sensitivity to O2 at this stage is attributed to a lack of available adsorption sites within the overlayer. As irradiation continues in UHV the isobutane yield simply increases and plateaus, producing a constant isobutene : isobutane ratio near 1 : 1. In O2, the variation in the isobutene : isobutane ratio versus irradiation time is more complex. Initially, as in UHV, there is a shift towards a 1 : 1 ratio, but with time isobutene is again favoured; the precise profile is dependent upon the O2 partial pressure. From STM of reacted surfaces it was found that the latter change can be correlated with a variation in surface morphology. Under UHV conditions, UV induced decomposition always occurs fairly randomly across the surface, whereas in O2 extended voids appear in the TMA overlayer coinciding with the shift in selectivity back towards isobutene. Inside the voids it is concluded that adsorbed Ox species reside, and that UV induced TMA decomposition is enhanced at their borders, presumably at least partially due to Ox species removing Ti3+ species, with the resulting tert-butyl radical selectivity decomposing to isobutene. More specific reaction details remain somewhat uncertain, although it is suggested that TMATMA interactions may determine selec- tivity, and more work is required for complete atomic scale understanding. Finally, we note that the role of O2 outlined by Henderson and co-workers is entirely different to that ascribed to it by Idriss et al. in the UV induced decomposition of acetate,148 where they suppose that it directly initiates acetate bond breaking.

Alcohols The reactivity of TiO2 with alcohols is important in a number of technological applications. Methanol and ethanol, in parti- cular, may be exploited as energy carriers in renewable sources, and alcohols in general can act as simple model contaminants to test environmental cleaning strategies, one of which is catalytic oxidation to CO2.
In this section, we explore the dissociative and molecular adsorption of alcohols as well as various decomposition mechanisms. Methanol is discussed first, followed by a series of (C2C8) aliphatic alcohols that are treated together as they share the same type of chemistry. Photodecomposition is also discussed in the case of 2-propanol and ethanol.

6.1.1
Dissociative and molecular adsorption. TPD peaks and shoulders found for CH3OH at B295 K, B350 K, and B480 K are shown in Fig. 28.151 Peaks are also present at B150 K and B165 K (off-scale in Fig. 28) which are assigned to methanol multilayers and methanol adsorbed at Ob sites,respectively. The assignment of the B150 K peak was based on comparisons to methanol TPD from metals (e.g. ref. 152) whilst the B165 K peak was assigned by analogy with the behaviour of water on TiO2(110) (section 3.3). The intense peak at B295 K is assigned to molecular desorption of methanol adsorbed on Ti5c sites, whilst the small peak at B480 K has a coverage consistent with that of the Ob-vac density. In a SSIMS experiment analogous to the one de- scribed for water adsorption (section
3.1),60
the TiO- (CH3OH)+ signal was shown to attenuate to near zero at B295 K with the TiO(CH3O)+ signal attenuating above B500 K. This identifies the B295 K peak as a molecular desorption peak and the B480 K peak as a CH3O/OHbr Fig. 27 STM images (160 A )2 of TMA covered TiO2(110)11 at 280

When the surface is isotopically enriched with 18O before exposure to CH3
16OH, CH3
16OH is preferentially desorbed at B480 K. Given the SSIMS results, the lack of isotopic scrambling of 18O/16O cannot be due to molecular desorption.
Instead the isotope studies indicate that the methyl group of the methoxy is immobile, remaining attached to the 16O from the dosed methanol. Therefore the recombinative desorption of methanol at B480 K must rely on the mobility of hydrogen from OHb.
The B350 K peak is much more difficult to assign, with both SSIMS data and HREELS spectra being inconclusive.
However, on the basis of similar behaviour following electron bombardment,153 Henderson et al. tentatively assign the B350 K peak to methanol dissociated at non-defective parts of the surface, probably Ti5c sites. By combining static DFT calculations with molecular dynamics simulations, Sa nchez de Armas et al.154 suggest that both molecular adsorption and dissociation at Ti5c sites are viable, the preferred state being highly dependent on the technical details of the calculation.
Onda et al.155,156 give some indirect evidence that methanol dissociates at Ti5c sites. Using 2PP spectroscopy, they detect an empty wet electron state B2.22.4 eV above EF, analogous to that found for water.71 However, for water this state was only present when the surface had appreciable Ob-vac density,achieved by vacuum annealing. These vacancies were required in order to produce the OHb sites associated with the wet electron state. When the surface was annealed in O2, the wet electron state did not form. In contrast, the wet electron state forms on a methanol-exposed surface whether Ob-vacs are present or not. The different behaviour can be explained if it is not necessary for Ob-vacs to be present in order to dissociate methanol. Because of the importance of holeelectron separa- tion in photocatalysis, it is significant that whilst electrons injected into the wet electron state associated with water decay within 15 femtoseconds,71 wet electrons can be stabilised by methanol into the picosecond range.156 Zhang et al.157 give direct evidence for the dissociation of methanol in Ob-vacs. Fig. 29b shows the TiO2(110) surface after a low exposure to methanol. Bright spots are observed in positions previously taken by Ob-vacs. These bright spots were assigned as methoxy and OHb pairs, by analogy with the OHb pairs formed from water exposure.68 Further exposure to methanol leads to the appearance of darker spots as well as an increase in the number of bright spots (Fig. 29c). The darker spots are assigned to OHb which have migrated along [1 10] via proton exchange with molecularly adsorbed methanol in a similar way to that described for water in section 3.2.68 Following a scan at a raised bias of +3 V, the darker spots are removed, whereas the brighter spots remain. As it has already been shown that OHb can be removed by ca. +3 V tip bias, the darker species are confirmed as OHb,28 and the brighter spots can be assigned to methoxy groups.

Zhang et al. do not discuss whether they observe methoxy or methanol species at the Ti5c sites. However, inspection of Fig. 29b, reveals the presence of a few new bright spots on the bright (Ti5c) rows which may be due to either molecular methanol or methoxy dissociated at Ti5c sites.
6.1.2
Decomposition. Farfan-Arribas and Madix found a quite different behaviour in the high temperature region of their methanol TPD spectra.158 Instead of a methanol peak at B480 K, peaks for methanol and formaldehyde evolved at B630 K. This discrepancy with respect to the results of Henderson et al. was attributed to the different sample pre- paration methods used. Henderson et al.151 annealed their sample in UHV, as described in section 2. On the other hand,in order to assess the influence of defects on reactivity, Farfan-Arribas and Madix prepared their surfaces by first annealing, then cooling to room temperature in B2.7  106 mbar O2, which can lead to various surface terminations together with the presence of Oad, as discussed in section 4.
When O2 was deliberately pre-dosed onto a UHV annealed TiO2(110) surface before exposure to methanol, formaldehyde evolved at B625 K together with methanol, regardless of the temperature of O2 exposure (150715 K).151 As the mass 29 signal can have contributions from formaldehyde and metha- nol cracking, the mass 29 traces are scaled to the mass 31 (methanol) traces. In this way, any formaldehyde desorption shows up as the difference between the two curves as shown in Fig. 30. The partition between formaldehyde and methanol contained in the B625 K peaks is almost equal for all O2 exposures, suggestive of a disproportionation reaction be- tween two methoxy groups. When O2 is pre-exposed onto the surface at B150 K, an additional formaldehyde shoulder evolves at low temperature (B250 K) which was attributed to a molecular O2 species abstracting a hydrogen atom from the methyl group of methanol.

C2C8 aliphatic alcohols
6.2.1
Dissociative and molecular adsorption. Alcohol TPD spectra in general follow the basic pattern found for methanol in Fig. 28. Such spectra have been taken for ethanol,2-propanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, tert-butanol,1-octanol, 2-octanol, 3-octanol, and 4-octanol.159165 Taking 2-propanol as an example, there is a sharp peak at B160 K which cannot be saturated and has zero order desorption kinetics, consistent with a multilayer. Just above this is a feature tentatively assigned to 2-propanol molecules bound to the Ob atoms. Two peaks between B250 K and B450 K can be attributed to desorption of 2-propanol molecularly adsorbed at Ti5c sites and/or recombination of OHb and propoxy dissociated at Ti5c. Finally, a high temperature peak is found at B560 K, which becomes more intense with a greater Ob-vac density and can therefore be assigned to a recombinative reaction of propoxy at Ob-vacs and OHb.
Zhang et al.164 recorded STM images before and after exposure to 2-butanol at B300 K. Again, in a similar way to experiments using methanol, 2-butoxy/OHb pairs are found where Ob-vacs were previously positioned. High resolution images show that the OHb species appear as fainter spots next to the 2-butoxy species (see Fig. 31). Isolated OHb were also observed and attributed to OHb which have diffused in the [1 10] direction via proton exchange with 2-butanol, after similar conclusions with methanol and water.68,157 As the 2-butoxy species take the positions of the Ob-vacs filled, this indicates that, as with methanol,157 it is the OH bond which breaks to form the 2-butoxy species. Bright spots can also be observed on the bright Ti5c rows, one of which was seen filling an Ob-vac in the sequential STM images of Fig. 31. This sequence was interpreted as molecular 2-butanol dissociating in an Ob-vac. As the adsorption behaviour of ROH, where R = H, CH3 and 2-butyl, is similar (except for the question of whether ROH dissociates at Ti5c sites where it is generally thought that there is some dissociation for alcohols at Ti5c sites but not for water), Zhang et al. suggest that all alcohols may follow this behaviour: (i) the ROH bond is cleaved at the Ob-vac sites with RO taking the place of the Ob-vac and (ii) ROH adsorbs at Ti5c sites and facilitates diffusion of the OHb groups formed from dissociation at Ob-vacs.
6.2.2
Thermal decomposition. Whilst the adsorption beha- viour of alcohols in general seem to follow that of methanol,additional reaction paths are revealed when masses in addition Fig. 30 The effect of O2 pre-adsorption temperature on the TPD properties of CH3OH from the TiO2(110) surface.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online to alcohol are tracked in TPD. One of these reactions is dehydration to alkene. Fig. 32 shows propene TPD spectra alongside traces for 2-propanol and water after TiO2(110) was exposed to mono-deuterated 2-propanol (2-PrOD). Focusing first on the high temperature (HT) region, it can be seen that the propene and 2-PrOH signals peak at B575 K.
In an earlier study by Farfan-Arribas and Madix,160 the 2-PrOH and equivalent 1-PrOH peaks were found B25 K and B40 K lower than the propene peaks, respectively. Similarly, Gamble et al.162 and Farfan-Arribas and Madix,160 respec- tively, found the equivalent ethanol peak B7.5 K and B15 K lower than the ethene peak. Farfan-Arribas and Madix also detected CO and H2 peaks B10110 K higher than the alcohol peaks for 2-PrOH and 1-PrOH whereas Dohna lek and co- workers find no evidence for H2 or CO desorption for either these or any other alcohols tested.159,163 Different sample preparation conditions may account for the appearance of H2 and CO in the work of Farfan-Arribas and Madix.
Dohna lek and co-workers prepared their surfaces by annea- ling in UHV as described in section 2. Whilst Gamble et al. and Farfan-Arribas and Madix both annealed their samples in an O2 pressure (1106 and 2.7106 mbar, respectively), Farfan-Arribas and Madix also allowed their sample to cool to room temperature in the same O2 pressure, a procedure which we know from section 4 may lead to the formation of Oad. The reason for the higher temperature onset of the alkene peaks in the earlier work is unclear, with Bondarchuk et al.159 suggesting the temperature differences are within experimental error, at least for 2-propanol (and therefore implicitly for ethanol where the temperature offset is less).
Returning to Fig. 32: the B575 K propene and 2-PrOH peaks are sandwiched by two water peaksone B60 K below at B515 K, the other B5 K higher at B580 K. The water peak at B515 K is well understood and arises from the recombina- tion of two OHb groups (see section 3.1 for further details and notice that due to an offset of the temperature scale compared with the earlier work, the peak is slightly shifted from B490 K). In Fig. 32, this B515 K water peak is dominated by D2O and must therefore arise from ODb formed from dissociated 2-PrOD. The propene evolved from 2-PrOD is always C3H6,ruling out any mechanism which incorporates the OH hydro- gen into the resulting alkene. For ethanol, Gamble et al.162 then Kim et al.165 tested the dehydration mechanism by using CD3CH2OH, with the product always being CD2CH2. This is a key result because it shows that it is the C2 carbonhydrogen bond that is eliminated.

Contributions from fragmentation of 2-PrOD traced by mass 46 have been subtracted from the mass 18, 19, 20, 41, and 45 curves to obtain the net desorption profiles of H2O, HDO, D2O, C3H6, and (CH3)2CHOH,respectively.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online There are other notable isotope effects. When 2-PrOD8 is used, the propene peak is found B10 K higher than when either 2-PrOH or 2-PrOD is used. This indicates that CH (or CD) bond stretching is involved in the rate-determining step for propene formation. Likewise, in the earlier ethanol study,162 CD3CH2OH gave an ethene peak B8.5 K higher than CH3CH2OD, showing specifically that it is the C2 carbonhydrogen bond which is involved in the rate-determin- ing step.
The HT dehydration mechanism proposed by Bondarchuk et al.159 is shown in Fig. 33 using 2-propanol as an example. As the temperature increases, a hydrogen atom connected to the C2 carbon forms a bond with an Ob atom so that the 2-propoxy thermally passes through a cyclic activated complex (ObCCHOb) that concertedly leads to the formation of propene and OHb. The evolved OHb recombines either with a propoxy to form 2-PrOH or another OHb to form H2O. These two reactions explain the desorption of non-deuterated 2-PrOH at B575 K and water at B580 K, when 2-PrOD is used as in Fig. 32. Conversely, when the surface was exposed to 1-C3D7OH,160 fully-deuterated 1-propanol desorbs in this HT peak.
Alkyl substituents display an inductive effect whereby elec- tron density is released to carbon atoms connected to electro- negative atoms. Larger R groups have a greater inductive effect, as do multiple R groups. By investigating the peak desorption temperatures for a number of alcohols, Kim et al.165 showed that alcohols with more inductive R groups convert to the alkene at lower temperatures. In line with this, Fig. 34 shows that the temperature of the HT alkene peaks increases from tertiary to secondary, and finally to primary alcohols. They concluded that the induction stabilises the C1 carbond+Ob bond in their proposed cyclic complex, thereby reducing the activation energy for alkene formation. This dependence on the inductive effect gives evidence for hetero- lytic bond cleavage during the dehydration of these alcohols and therefore conflicts with a radical mechanism proposed by Farfan-Arribas and Madix.160 Furthermore, the observation that both C1 carbonOb elongation and C2 carbonH stretch- ing affects the TPD peak positions indicates that both are involved in the rate-determining step, in line with the cyclic complex proposed.159 We turn now to the low temperature (LT) region in Fig. 32 where it is apparent that propene is also produced.159,163 This is consistent with the TPD results of Gamble et al. where an ethene peak evolved from ethanol TPD at B360 K as well as B650 K.162 Kim et al.163 showed that alkene evolution in this temperature range is not affected by the presence of Ob-vacs.
This was tested by pre-dosing the TiO2(110) with water in order to fill the Ob-vacs with OHb. This suppressed the HT alkene channel but in the LT region, propene TPD spectra were identical to those recorded without water pre-dosing.
There are two significant features of the LT TPD region in Fig. 32: (1) a 2-PrOH peak appears at a similar temperature to Fig. 33 Schematic representation of the proposed reaction mechan- ism of 2-propoxy and hydroxyl groups at high temperature (4500 K).
The red circles denote original positions of Ob-vacs which are filled with the oxygen from 2-propoxy when 2-propanol dissociates. The yellow circles represent the hydrogen which forms the accompanying OHb species. At 520 K, the hydrogens are mobile along the Ob rows and can react to form water that desorbs leaving a new Ob-vac (blue circle with a dashed red outline). At 570 K, 2-propoxy groups react by dehydration to form propene by C2H and C1Ob bond breaking.
This leaves further OHb groups with an increasing concentration as propene forms and as these OHb react together, the second water desorption peak forms. Reproduced from ref. 159 with permission. r 2007 American Chemical Society.
Fig. 34 TPD spectra of alkene formation from 10 alcohols dosed on TiO2(110) at 100 K. The spectra are grouped as primary, secondary,and tertiary alcohols. The net alkene desorption spectra shown were obtained by subtracting the fragmentation contributions of molecular alcohol. Mass 27 and 41 were used for ethene and propene, respec- tively, and mass 56 was used for butenes and octenes. The alcohol dose in each case was that which saturates the Ob-vacs and the Ti5c sites. All spectra were normalized to the HT alkene desorption peaks. The surface in each case contained a density of 0.035 ML Ob-vacs before exposure to alcohol. Modified from ref. 163 with permission.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online the LT propene peak, which is surprising because the alcohol dosed was 2-PrOD; (2) a broad D2O feature appears between B250400 K with local peaks at B290 K and B330 K. The lower temperature peak at B290 K corresponds to molecular desorption of water adsorbed at Ti5c sites (see section 3.1 and notice that the equivalent peak was found at B265 K due to systematic offset in the temperatures) but the origin of the peak at B330 K is unknown.
Fig. 34 shows the LT channel is open for 7 of the 10 alcohols tested, the exceptions being for 3-octanol, 4-octanol, and tert- butanol. From this, Kim et al.163 suggest that for the LT channel to proceed, one R group must be hydrogen and one of the other R groups must either be hydrogen again or CH3.
The tentative reaction mechanism proposed by Kim et al.163 and illustrated in Fig. 35 can explain all these observations.
The reaction involves one alcohol and one alkoxy both adsorbed on Ti5c sites randomly meeting with a specific orientation.
Using 2-PrOD as an example,2-propoxy abstracts H from the 2-propoxy group of 2-PrOD explaining the desorption of non-deuterated 2-PrOH. The previously adsorbed 2-PrOD which has lost its H atom to the 2-propoxy rearranges and desorbs as propene, leaving behind an OD group attached to Ti5c (ODt). This ODt group can then recombine with ODb (already formed by dissociation of 2-PrOD at either Ti5c sites or Ob-vacs) so there is no net loss or gain of O at the surface. Desorption of D2O thus formed could be responsible for the peak at B330 K, which seems reasonable given that OHt groups recombine with each other at B290320 K (see sections 4.1 and 4.3). The requirement for the alcohol and alkoxy to meet in a specific orientation accounts for the fact that the bulkier alcohols do not form alkenes in the LT region.
There is another HT pathway active only for some of the alcohols studied, namely dehydrogenation to the correspond- ing aldehyde. As described in section 6.1.2, for aldehyde TPD spectra, masses with contributions from both the parent alcohol and the aldehyde are tracked. These are scaled and superimposed on traces from the parent alcohol. In this way,the difference between the curves corresponds to the aldehyde yield. Following this procedure, Kim et al.163 show that aldehydes evolve at about the same temperature as the corre- sponding HT alcohol desorption peak. As such, dehydrogena- tion was attributed to alkoxy adsorbed at the Ob-vacs.
Aldehyde formation has only been observed for primary alcohols.160,163 Based on the assumption that a hydrogen atom is abstracted directly from the C1 carbon to form aldehyde,this selection rule can be quite simply understood. Tertiary alcohols can be excluded immediately because they have no such hydrogen species by definition. Assuming that the two C1H bonds are equivalent in primary alcohols, then the probability for dehydrogenation of primary alcohols, based only on the presence of two C1 hydrogen atoms rather than one, must be twice that of secondary alcohols. Added to this, it has already been shown that the activation energy for dehy- dration of secondary alcohols is lower than for primary alcohols. Hence, for secondary alcohols, dehydrogenation will compete less successfully against dehydration than it would for primary alcohols.
Kim et al.163 found the aldehyde yield to be much smaller than the alkene and alcohol yields for the alcohols tested. For example, the propanal yield from 1-propanol was about 10% of the HT propene yield. In the case of ethanol, Gamble et al.162 did not detect any significant amount of acetaldehyde,presumably because the signal was too weak. On the other hand, Farfan-Arribas and Madix160 found an equal three-way partition of alcohol, alkene, and aldehyde in the HT region for both ethanol and 1-propanol. As discussed for the formation of CO, this divergence from the results of Gamble et al. and Kim et al. may be due to differences in sample preparation.
6.2.3
Photodecomposition. Using molecular beam studies, Brinkley and Engel found a new dehydrogenation pathway for 2-propanol.166,167 A mixed beam of O2 and 2-propanol in a 7 : 1 ratio was directed at the TiO2(110) surface which was then irradiated with UV light. When the light was switched on, a mass spectrometer detected intense transient peaks for acetone and water, both of which decayed in seconds then remained constant until the light was switched off. The transient peaks are due to the surface being saturated with O2 and 2-propanol in the interval before the light was switched on. This leads to a rapid initial reaction when the light is first switched on, but once the excess O2 and 2-propanol are consumed in the production of acetone, the reaction becomes limited by the molecular beam flux and the curves fall to steady-state levels.
The acetone and water yields are approximately equal, sug- gesting that one 2-propanol molecule reacts with half an O2 molecule to form one acetone molecule and one water molecule.
Fig. 35 Schematic of proposed LT dehydration mechanism. The key intermediate is a complex (step II) formed by interaction of an oriented alkoxy with an oriented chemisorbed alcohol (step I). There is a concerted rearrangement that involves a C2 hydrogen coupling to the alkoxy oxygen and simultaneous cleavage of the CO bond of the chemisorbed alcohol. Step III illustrates the final recombinative desorption of D2O. Reproduced from ref. 163 with permission. r 2007 American Chemical Society. 2350  Chem. Soc.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online The same reaction was also performed statically. In this case, the same 2-propanolO2 mixture was beamed onto a TiO2(110) surface held at B185 K, after which the surface was irradiated with UV light with the molecular beam switched off.
Any adsorbates were then desorbed into a mass spectrometer to measure the total amount of acetone produced, which maximised at B0.17 ML. On a fully oxidised surface, pre- pared by annealing in 1.3  106 mbar O2 then cooling in the same O2 pressure to 300 K, the maximum amount of acetone produced fell to B0.08 ML, but did not reduce completely.
This led Brinkley and Engel to conclude that about half of the acetone originated from 2-propanol somehow associated with Ob-vacs, with the other half coming from 2-propanol at other defect sites, such as step edges. Ob-vacs were not thought to participate directly in the reaction because the oxidising con- ditions of the experiment would fill them. Given what is now known about the behaviour of O2 on TiO2(110) (see section 4),the importance of the Ob-vacs may lie in facilitating the formation of Oad species. Brinkley and Engel suggest that photoexcited electrons are captured by O2, thus allowing the holes (h+) to attack the 2-propanol molecules and initiate dehydrogenation to acetone.
By tracking the C 1s peaks using core level PES, Jayaweera et al.168 monitored the effect of UV illumination on ethanol adsorbed on TiO2(110). A small peak evolved at B290 eV that was attributed to either acetate or formate anions. When the same procedure is followed in a pressure of 1.3  106 mbar O2, a much clearer B290 eV peak developed. Thus the reaction on the clean surface was attributed to background O2, the clean surfaces being prepared by annealing in
6.7  105 mbar O2. By comparison with work on powdered
TiO2,169 Jayaweera et al. conclude that the first step in the reaction is dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde, after which further oxidation forms either acetate or formate, with CO2 being released in the latter case. The initial step in the mechanism proposed by Jayaweera et al. is the same as that proposed by Brinkley and Engel, i.e. O2 captures photoexcited electrons.167 However, the next step in Jayaweera et al.s proposed mechanism differs in that they envisage a direct reaction between ethoxy and O2 . Further work is needed in order to achieve an atomic level understanding of both these photoreactions.

Outlook Whilst not yet approaching our level of understanding of metal surfaces, our knowledge of oxide surface chemistry has developed considerably over the last decade or so. This is especially so in the case of the model oxide surface TiO2(110), where trends are clearly emerging that are quite different to the behaviour of metals. In particular, the role of defects such as O vacancies has now been evaluated in exquisite detail and it is clear that they play a crucial role in surface reactions. This evaluation has involved the application of scanning probe methods in combination with first principles calculations, both of which have followed mechanistic studies using conventional methods.
There is a clear need to further extend the surface reaction studies to other types of metal oxide surface in order to evaluate trends in reaction mechanisms across different oxide surfaces. Iron oxides would be good initial candidates since Fe2O3 is a promising catalyst, for instance in the oxidation of benzene and chlorobenzene, and various FexOy compounds play an important role in geochemistry. Of course, there have been a number of surface chemistry studies of metal oxide surfaces other than TiO2(110), including those of iron oxides,but very few of these match the mechanistic detail demon- strated in this review.
In the near future there is no doubt that a lot of attention will be focused on studies at elevated pressures and at the solidliquid interface. Photon-in photon-out techniques, such as SXRD, will be employed, as well as approaches modified to operate in the high pressure regime, e.g. high-pressure PES,which has already been applied to the TiO2(110)11/water system.87,88 An area of particular topical interest is the inter- face between light harvesting surfaces (e.g. TiO2) and liquid water in connection with photocatalysis. Ultra-fast timing measurements may also have a significant impact here. It might be possible to use pump probe measurements, involving a UV pump and soft X-ray probe to look at charge transfer processes following the light harvesting event. It has already proved possible to measure the 15 fs lifetime of a wet electron state on TiO2(110) using two-photon photoemission.71 Material in this review highlights the enormous impact that scanning probe methods have had on our understanding of reactions at oxide surfaces. However, the lack of chemical specificity with STM and AFM is a limitation. STM-inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy could be a solution; this is a technique that can be used to measure the vibrational spec- trum of a single molecule.170,171 Another technique that can be used to image with chemical specificity is X-ray photoelectron microscopy.172,173 Although this is currently limited to a spatial resolution of 20 nm or so, it is hoped that this will improve to 2 nm over the next decade. Realising this goal would open new vistas.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
