[1] "There is a clear need to further extend the surface reaction studies to other types of metal oxide surface in order to evaluate trends in reaction mechanisms across different oxide surfaces."
[2] "It might be possible to use pump probe measurements, involving a UV pump and soft X-ray probe to look at charge transfer processes following the light harvesting event."
[3] "An area of particular topical interest is the interface between light harvesting surfaces (e.g. TiO2) and liquid water in connection with photocatalysis."
