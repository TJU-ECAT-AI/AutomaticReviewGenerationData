The proton (H+ (ads)) resulting from the dissociation of HCOOH is found to be attached to a bridging oxygen, forming a bridging hydroxyl (OHb). On the TiO2(110) surface, the dehydration reaction is dominant at substrate temperatures around 4500 K, while at lower temperatures, dehydration is the prevailing process. In the representation of the adsorbate, the light spheres in the rings depict nitrogen atoms, the dark spheres are carbon atoms, the smallest spheres are hydrogen atoms, and the largest are oxygen atoms.

从研究中得知，HCOOH 分解产生的质子（H+ (ads)）附着在桥接氧上，形成桥接羟基（OHb）。在TiO2(110)表面上，4500 K左右的温度下，脱水反应占主导地位，而较低温度下则是脱水过程占优势。在吸附物的表示中，环中的浅色球体代表氮原子，深色球体是碳原子，最小的球体是氢原子，最大的是氧原子。
