[1] "The formation of an oxygen vacancy is greatly facilitated at the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface close to the Zr centers, with a reduction of the formation energy by as much as 0.52 eV per vacancy."
[2] "The reduction leads to a new gap state appearing above the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level which is shown in Fig. 5d. The integration of this new peak gives again the total number of two electrons, which are almost completely localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce cations of the vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies to facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants. Oxygen vacancies serve as active sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules or oxygen-containing species, which then participate in the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is easier, potentially enhancing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This is because a reduced barrier for oxygen vacancy formation leads to an increased availability of active sites for the reaction, thereby improving the efficiency of the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位来促进反应物的吸附和活化。氧空位作为活性位点用于吸附氧气分子或含氧物种，然后参与氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv值较低意味着氧空位的形成更容易，可能增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为氧空位形成能降低使得表面活性位点的可用性增加，从而提高氧化过程的效率。
