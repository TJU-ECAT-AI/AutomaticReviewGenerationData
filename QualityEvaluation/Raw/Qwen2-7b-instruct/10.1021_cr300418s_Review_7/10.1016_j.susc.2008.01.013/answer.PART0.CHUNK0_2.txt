[1] "It is found that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is greatly facilitated at the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface close to the Zr centers, with a reduction of the formation energy by as much as 0.52 eV per vacancy."
[2] "The effect of Zr doping on the electronic structure can be seen in the DOSs for the unreduced and reduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) (the Vb model) in Fig. 5c and d. It is found that the DOSs for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and the CeO2(111) systems are very similar, which suggests that the Zr doping has no obvious effect on the electronic structure when the O vacancy is created: the two excess electrons left by the released oxygen still localize on two Ce ions neighboring the vacancy, in agreement with the experimen- tal results [12,51]."
[3] "The reduction leads to a new gap state appearing above the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level which is shown in Fig. 5d. The integration of this new peak gives again the total number of two electrons, which are almost completely localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce cat- ions of the vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and subsequent dissociation of an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxygen vacancy is more easily formed, which in turn facilitates the reaction process by providing more active sites for reactants to bind. This enhanced availability of active sites leads to an increase in the reaction rate, thereby boosting the catalytic activity. Additionally, the presence of oxygen vacancies can enhance the surface's oxidizing ability by allowing for more efficient transfer of electrons to the reactants, promoting the oxidation process. The similarity in the electronic structures of the unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and CeO2(111) systems indicates that Zr doping does not significantly alter the electronic properties when an oxygen vacancy is created. However, it does facilitate the reduction of the surface, leading to the formation of a new gap state above the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level. This gap state is localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce ions adjacent to the oxygen vacancy, contributing to the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the oxygen vacancy. This reduction process is in agreement with experimental findings and supports the enhancement of the redox properties and thermal stability of CeO2 when zirconium is added, forming a CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成并随后分解氧空位来操作。氧空位形成的能量要求（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更容易形成，这反过来通过提供更多的活性位点来促进反应过程，供反应物结合。这种增加的活性位点可用性导致反应速率增加，从而增强催化活性。此外，氧空位的存在可以增强表面的氧化能力，通过更有效地将电子转移到反应物上来促进氧化过程。未掺杂的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)和CeO2(111)系统的电子结构相似表明，当创建氧空位时，Zr掺杂对电子性质的影响并不明显。然而，它确实促进了表面的还原，导致形成一个位于O 2p能带边缘之上和费米能级之下的新间隙状态。这个间隙状态主要集中在氧空位附近的两个最近邻Ce离子上，有助于相邻于氧空位的两个Ce原子的还原。这一还原过程与实验结果一致，并支持了在添加锆形成CeO2-ZrO2固溶体时CeO2的红氧化性和热稳定性显著增强。
