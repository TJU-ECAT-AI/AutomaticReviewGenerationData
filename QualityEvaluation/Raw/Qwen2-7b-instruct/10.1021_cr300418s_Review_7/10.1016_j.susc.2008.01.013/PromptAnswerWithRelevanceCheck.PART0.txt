[1] "It is found that (i) Zr doping induces a severe distortion of the unreduced surface structure; (ii) at the reduced Zr-doped ceria(111) surface, the oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show much larger displacements than those on the pure CeO2(111) surface; (iii) an oxygen vacancy is more easily formed around the Zr dopant, and the reduction energy is lowered by about 0.5 eV; (iv) the excess electrons left by the removed oxygen atom localize on the two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy and thus brings about the reduction of the two Ce4+ ions; and (v) the atomic structure modification induced by the Zr doping plays a vital role in facilitating the reduction of the ceriazirconia solid solution as compared to the pure ceria."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are energetically favorable defects in the oxide surface. These vacancies allow for the adsorption of reactants, such as oxygen, which then facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates an easier formation of vacancies, which in turn can enhance the surface's catalytic activity by providing more active sites for reaction. The document highlights that Zr doping facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, lowering the ΔEv by approximately 0.5 eV, and enables the excess electrons to localize on the Ce cations neighboring the vacancy, leading to the reduction of these ions. This results in an enhanced reduction energy, making the Zr-doped ceria surface more reactive for oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷文机制通过形成氧空位在氧化物表面进行操作。这些空位允许吸附反应物，如氧气，从而促进氧化过程。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表示空位更容易形成，这可以增强表面的催化活性，提供更多的活性位点以促进反应。文献指出，Zr掺杂能够促进氧空位的形成，降低ΔEv约0.5 eV，并使多余的电子局部化在与空位相邻的Ce离子上，导致这些离子的还原。这导致了还原能的增加，使得Zr掺杂的铈氧化物表面更具有氧化反应活性。

[2] "The effect of Zr doping on the electronic structure can be seen in the DOSs for the unreduced and reduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) (the Vb model) in Fig. 5c and d. It is found that the DOSs for the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and the CeO2(111) systems are very similar, which suggests that the Zr doping has no obvious effect on the electronic structure when the O vacancy is created: the two excess electrons left by the released oxygen still localize on two Ce ions neighboring the vacancy, in agreement with the experimen- tal results [12,51]."
[3] "The reduction leads to a new gap state appearing above the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level which is shown in Fig. 5d. The integration of this new peak gives again the total number of two electrons, which are almost completely localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce cat- ions of the vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and subsequent dissociation of an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxygen vacancy is more easily formed, which in turn facilitates the reaction process by providing more active sites for reactants to bind. This enhanced availability of active sites leads to an increase in the reaction rate, thereby boosting the catalytic activity. Additionally, the presence of oxygen vacancies can enhance the surface's oxidizing ability by allowing for more efficient transfer of electrons to the reactants, promoting the oxidation process. The similarity in the electronic structures of the unreduced Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) and CeO2(111) systems indicates that Zr doping does not significantly alter the electronic properties when an oxygen vacancy is created. However, it does facilitate the reduction of the surface, leading to the formation of a new gap state above the O 2p band edge and below the Fermi level. This gap state is localized on two of the nearest neighbor Ce ions adjacent to the oxygen vacancy, contributing to the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the oxygen vacancy. This reduction process is in agreement with experimental findings and supports the enhancement of the redox properties and thermal stability of CeO2 when zirconium is added, forming a CeO2-ZrO2 solid solution.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成并随后分解氧空位来操作。氧空位形成的能量要求（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更容易形成，这反过来通过提供更多的活性位点来促进反应过程，供反应物结合。这种增加的活性位点可用性导致反应速率增加，从而增强催化活性。此外，氧空位的存在可以增强表面的氧化能力，通过更有效地将电子转移到反应物上来促进氧化过程。未掺杂的Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)和CeO2(111)系统的电子结构相似表明，当创建氧空位时，Zr掺杂对电子性质的影响并不明显。然而，它确实促进了表面的还原，导致形成一个位于O 2p能带边缘之上和费米能级之下的新间隙状态。这个间隙状态主要集中在氧空位附近的两个最近邻Ce离子上，有助于相邻于氧空位的两个Ce原子的还原。这一还原过程与实验结果一致，并支持了在添加锆形成CeO2-ZrO2固溶体时CeO2的红氧化性和热稳定性显著增强。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies to facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactants. Oxygen vacancies serve as active sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules or oxygen-containing species, which then participate in the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is easier, potentially enhancing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This is because a reduced barrier for oxygen vacancy formation leads to an increased availability of active sites for the reaction, thereby improving the efficiency of the oxidation process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial for the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, known as ΔEv, determines whether the reaction can proceed efficiently. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. The presence of Zr dopants facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, reducing ΔEv and thus improving the surface's reactivity and stability.
