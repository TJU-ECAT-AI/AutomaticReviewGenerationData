[1] "It is found that (i) Zr doping induces a severe distortion of the unreduced surface structure; (ii) at the reduced Zr-doped ceria(111) surface, the oxygen anions around the oxygen vacancy show much larger displacements than those on the pure CeO2(111) surface; (iii) an oxygen vacancy is more easily formed around the Zr dopant, and the reduction energy is lowered by about 0.5 eV; (iv) the excess electrons left by the removed oxygen atom localize on the two Ce cations neighboring the vacancy and thus brings about the reduction of the two Ce4+ ions; and (v) the atomic structure modification induced by the Zr doping plays a vital role in facilitating the reduction of the ceriazirconia solid solution as compared to the pure ceria."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are energetically favorable defects in the oxide surface. These vacancies allow for the adsorption of reactants, such as oxygen, which then facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates an easier formation of vacancies, which in turn can enhance the surface's catalytic activity by providing more active sites for reaction. The document highlights that Zr doping facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, lowering the ΔEv by approximately 0.5 eV, and enables the excess electrons to localize on the Ce cations neighboring the vacancy, leading to the reduction of these ions. This results in an enhanced reduction energy, making the Zr-doped ceria surface more reactive for oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷文机制通过形成氧空位在氧化物表面进行操作。这些空位允许吸附反应物，如氧气，从而促进氧化过程。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表示空位更容易形成，这可以增强表面的催化活性，提供更多的活性位点以促进反应。文献指出，Zr掺杂能够促进氧空位的形成，降低ΔEv约0.5 eV，并使多余的电子局部化在与空位相邻的Ce离子上，导致这些离子的还原。这导致了还原能的增加，使得Zr掺杂的铈氧化物表面更具有氧化反应活性。
