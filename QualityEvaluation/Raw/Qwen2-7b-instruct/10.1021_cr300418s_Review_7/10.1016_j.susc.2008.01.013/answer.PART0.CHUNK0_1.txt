[1] "The formation of an oxygen vacancy is greatly facilitated at the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface close to the Zr centers, with a reduction of the formation energy by as much as 0.52 eV per vacancy."
[2] "Each oxygen vacancy results in the reduction of two Ce cations neighboring the O vacancy."
[3] "The relaxation on the (111) surface of the Zr-doped ceria is found to be so large that the structure is significantly disturbed, especially in the vicinity of the Zr doping centers."
[4] "The Zr doping centers are as many as 25% of the cations sites,which thus offer active oxygen sites up to 75% of the total number of the surface oxygen anions."

1. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) is reduced by 0.52 eV per vacancy compared to pure CeO2, significantly lowering the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation.
2. Each oxygen vacancy leads to the reduction of two adjacent Ce ions, transforming them into Ce3+ species.
3. The presence of Zr doping centers in the ceria structure causes substantial distortion of the surface atomic arrangement, particularly around the Zr atoms.
4. In a ceria-zirconia solid solution like Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111), the Zr ions serve as numerous active oxygen sites, accounting for up to 75% of the total number of surface oxygen anions, which contribute to the enhanced reactivity.

1. 在Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)表面附近，氧空位的形成能量（ΔEv）降低了0.52 eV/每个空位，显著降低了氧气空位形成的能量壁垒。
2. 每个氧空位导致相邻的两个Ce离子被还原为Ce3+物种。
3. 在掺杂有Zr原子的铈氧化物结构中，Zr原子周围表面原子排列发生显著扭曲。
4. 在类似于Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111)的铈锆固溶体中，Zr离子充当大量活性氧位点，占总表面氧离子数的75%，这有助于增强反应性。
