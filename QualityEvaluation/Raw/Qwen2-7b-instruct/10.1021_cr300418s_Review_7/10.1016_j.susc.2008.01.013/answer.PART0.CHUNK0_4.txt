[1] "It is found that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is greatly facilitated at the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface close to the Zr centers, with a reduction of the formation energy by as much as 0.52 eV per vacancy."
[2] "The calculation of the vacancy formation energy (Evac) for the undoped CeO2(111) surface is 2.87 eV per vacancy."
[3] "On the Ce0.75Zr0.25O2(111) surface, we obtain a lowering of the vacancy formation energy by approximately 20% or 0.52 eV when the O vacancy is created next to the Zr ion."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial for the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, known as ΔEv, determines whether the reaction can proceed efficiently. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. The presence of Zr dopants facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, reducing ΔEv and thus improving the surface's reactivity and stability.

火星-范克雷维尔机制通过在氧化物表面形成和迁移氧空位进行操作。氧空位对于氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量，称为ΔEv，决定了反应能否高效进行。较低的ΔEv意味着氧空位形成的可能性更高，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。掺杂Zr可以促进氧空位的形成，降低ΔEv，进而提高表面的反应性和稳定性。
