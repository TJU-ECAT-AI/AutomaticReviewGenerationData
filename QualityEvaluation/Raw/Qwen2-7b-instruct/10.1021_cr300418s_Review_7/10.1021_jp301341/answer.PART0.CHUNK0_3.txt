[1] "The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
[2] "The energy of making an oxygen vacancy, due to the acidbase interaction, is lowered by the large Lewis acidbase pair interaction."
[3] "Making an oxygen vacancy on the surface of La2O3(001) requires 6.44 eV. (46) Doping with Cu reduces this number to 0.52 eV, doping with Zn to 2.01 eV, and doping with Mg to 2.59 eV."
[4] "The binding of a H atom (a Lewis base) provides another example. (77, 86, 94) The energy of the reaction 1/2H2 + Ox  H/Ox (here H/Ox is the oxide with a H adsorbed to make a hydroxyl) is 1.53 eV if Ox = La2O3 and 2.35 eV if Ox = MgLa2O3; it is 1.24 eV if Ox = CeO2 and 2.94 eV if Ox = LaCeO2."
[5] "This acidbase neutralization has an interesting consequence. Doping ceria with Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Ru, Pt, or Zr has roughly the same effect on the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. (87)"

1. The easier it is to make a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.
2. The acid-base interaction lowers the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.
3. Doping with copper, zinc, or magnesium reduces the energy needed to make an oxygen vacancy in La2O3(001) significantly.
4. The binding energy of a hydrogen atom to the surface of different oxides varies, influenced by the oxide's properties.
5. Doping ceria with Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Ru, Pt, or Zr has a similar effect on oxygen vacancy formation energy.
