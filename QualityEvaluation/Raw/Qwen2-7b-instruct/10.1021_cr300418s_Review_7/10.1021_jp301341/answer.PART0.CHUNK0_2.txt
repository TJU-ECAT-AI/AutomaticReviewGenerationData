1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface itself, not by adsorbed oxygen.
2. The ability of an oxide surface to make oxygen vacancies determines its oxidizing capability; the easier it is to make a vacancy, the better the oxidant the surface is.
3. If the oxygen is too easily removable, it becomes challenging to reintroduce it.
4. Converting methane into high-value chemicals has emerged as a critical priority for the chemical industry.
5. When ceria is doped with a high-valence dopant, the acidity of the surface enhances the binding energy of a base, affecting the chemistry of the surface.
6. Our proposed rules allow for the neutralization of a Lewis acid by adsorbing a Lewis base onto the surface, which can significantly alter the chemistry of the surface.

1. 在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，还原剂是由氧化物表面的氧原子氧化的，而不是吸附在表面的氧。
2. 氧化物表面生成空位的能力决定了其氧化能力；生成空位越容易，表面的氧化性越好。
3. 如果氧气过于容易被移除，就很难重新引入它。
4. 将甲烷转化为高价值化学品已成为化学工业的首要任务。
5. 当铈酸盐掺杂有高价掺杂物时，表面的酸性增强基团的基团与表面的结合能，影响表面的化学性质。
6. 我们提出的规则允许通过在表面上吸附一个碱性分子来中和一个Lewis酸，这可以显著改变表面的化学性质。
