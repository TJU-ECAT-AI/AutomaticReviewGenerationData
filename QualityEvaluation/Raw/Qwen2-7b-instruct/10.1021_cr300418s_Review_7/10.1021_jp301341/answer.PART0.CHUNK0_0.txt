[1] "The energy of making an oxygen vacancy is considerably lowered by the acid-base interaction."
[2] "This is similar to the behavior of an oxygen vacancy except that the oxygen vacancy is a stronger base since it has two electrons to donate."
[3] "Making an oxygen vacancy, which is a base, requires substantially less energy on an oxide doped with a LVD than on the undoped oxide."
[4] "The energy of making an oxygen vacancy in NiO(011) is 3.28 eV, and it is 4.13 eV for Nb-doped NiO, 4.25 eV for Ti-doped NiO, and 4.6 eV for Al-doped NiO."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reductant being oxidized by oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide, rather than by adsorbed oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove an oxygen atom, enhancing the surface's ability to act as an oxidant. This is crucial for the effectiveness of the oxide as a catalyst in oxidation reactions.

马尔森-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及还原剂通过氧化物表面的氧原子被氧化，而不是通过吸附的氧。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明更容易移除氧原子，增强表面作为氧化剂的能力。这对于氧化物作为氧化反应催化剂的有效性至关重要。
