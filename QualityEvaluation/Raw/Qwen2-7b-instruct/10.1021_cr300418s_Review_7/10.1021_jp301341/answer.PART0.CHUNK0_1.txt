[1] "According to the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide (not by adsorbed oxygen)."
[2] "The ease of making a vacancy, the better oxidant the surface is."
[3] "The energy of making a vacancy on the surface of La2O3(001) requires 6.44 eV."
[4] "Doping with Cu reduces this number to 0.52 eV, doping with Zn to 2.01 eV, and doping with Mg to 2.59 eV."
[5] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on H/LaCeO2 is essentially the same as that on CeO2; the presence of the adsorbed hydrogen cancels the effect of the La dopant."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide to oxidize a reductant, rather than relying on adsorbed oxygen molecules. 
2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's oxidizing capability.
3. Making an oxygen vacancy on the surface of La2O3(001) necessitates 6.44 eV.
4. Doping the oxide with copper reduces the energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation to 0.52 eV, zinc to 2.01 eV, and magnesium to 2.59 eV.
5. The presence of the adsorbed hydrogen on the surface modifies the effect of the lanthanum dopant on oxygen vacancy formation, essentially nullifying its influence.

1. 摩斯-范克列文机制通过利用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化还原剂，而不是吸附的氧分子。
2. 形成氧空位的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表示形成氧空位更为容易，增强了表面的氧化能力。
3. 在La2O3(001)表面上形成氧空位需要6.44 eV的能量。
4. 对氧化物进行铜掺杂将所需形成氧空位的能量降低至0.52 eV，锌降低至2.01 eV，镁降低至2.59 eV。
5. 表面吸附的氢的存在修改了镧掺杂对氧空位形成的影响，实质上消除了其影响。
