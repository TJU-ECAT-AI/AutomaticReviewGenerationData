[1] "The interaction between the PdCO complexes formed when CO adsorbs on a Pd atom imbedded in the surface layer, is also negligible."
[2] "The presence of CO in the gas-phase favors the presence of Pd in the top surface layer."
[3] "The interaction between the Pd atoms, with or without CO on them, is very weak and they will not aggregate to form Pd islands within the surface layer, nor will they form Pd domains in the bulk."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms to the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) play a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more energetically favorable process for oxygen atom insertion, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过促进氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子转移来运作。氧空位（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子插入过程更有利于能量，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
