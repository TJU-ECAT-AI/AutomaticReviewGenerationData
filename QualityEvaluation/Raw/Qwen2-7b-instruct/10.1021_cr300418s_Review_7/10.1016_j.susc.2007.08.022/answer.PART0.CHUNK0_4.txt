[1] "In the absence of gases Pd atoms have a strong tendency to substitute Au atoms in the bulk."
[2] "The presence of CO in the gas-phase favors the presence of Pd in the top surface layer."
[3] "The interaction between the Pd atoms, with or without CO on them, is very weak and they will not aggregate to form Pd islands within the surface layer, nor will they form Pd domains in the bulk."
[4] "The lack of interaction between the Pd atoms makes it easy to provide simple equations that give the equilibrium composition at the surface of a spherical nanoparticle, as a function of particle size, net alloy composition, temperature, and CO pressure."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Pd atoms in the absence of gases have a strong inclination to substitute Au atoms in the bulk. 
2. CO in the gas phase promotes Pd atoms to reside in the top surface layer.
3. The interaction between Pd atoms, regardless of whether they carry CO or not, is insignificant, preventing aggregation into Pd islands within the surface layer or domains in the bulk.
4. The absence of interaction between Pd atoms facilitates the derivation of straightforward equations that determine the equilibrium surface composition of a spherical nanoparticle, dependent on particle size, net alloy composition, temperature, and CO pressure.

1. 在没有气体的情况下，Pd原子倾向于在内部基体中替换Au原子。
2. CO在气相中促进Pd原子停留在顶层表面层。
3. Pd原子之间的相互作用微弱，无论它们是否携带CO，这阻止了它们在表面层内形成Pd岛屿或在基体内部形成区域。
4. 缺乏Pd原子之间的相互作用使得能够轻松地提供简单的方程来确定球形纳米粒子表面的平衡组成，该方程依赖于颗粒大小、净合金组成、温度和CO压力。
