[1] "The calculations reported here find that, if the alloy is in contact with vacuum, a Pd atom has the lowest energy when it is located in the bulk."
[2] "The presence of CO in the gas-phase favors the presence of Pd in the top surface layer."
[3] "The interaction between the Pd atoms, with or without CO on them, is very weak and they will not aggregate to form Pd islands within the surface layer, nor will they form Pd domains in the bulk."
[4] "Calculations with these equations suggest that the ability of the Pd/Au alloy to work as a selective catalyst is controlled by the binding energy of the reactants to the Pd surface atom."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between the reactants and the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that fewer energy barriers exist for oxygen vacancies to form, enhancing the surface's reactivity and ability to facilitate oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进反应物和氧化物表面之间的电子转移而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着形成氧空位的能垒较少，从而增强表面的反应性并提高其促进氧化反应的能力。
