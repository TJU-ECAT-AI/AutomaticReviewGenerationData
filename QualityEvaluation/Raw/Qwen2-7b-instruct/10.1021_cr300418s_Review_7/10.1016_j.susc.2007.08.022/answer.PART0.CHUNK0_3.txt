[1] "In the absence of gases Pd atoms have a strong tendency to substitute Au atoms in the bulk."
[2] "The presence of CO in the gas-phase favors the presence of Pd in the top surface layer."
[3] "The interaction between the Pd atoms, with or without CO on them, is very weak and they will not aggregate to form Pd islands within the surface layer, nor will they form Pd domains in the bulk."
[4] "The lack of interaction between the Pd atoms makes it easy to provide simple equations that give the equilibrium composition at the surface of a spherical nanoparticle, as a function of particle size, net alloy composition, temperature, and CO pressure."
[5] "According to Goodmans model the best selectivity is achieved when the surface has many clusters containing two next-nearest-neighbor Pd atoms and very few larger clusters."

1. In the absence of gases, Pd atoms tend to substitute Au atoms in the bulk.
2. The presence of CO in the gas-phase encourages Pd atoms to be in the top surface layer.
3. The weak interaction between Pd atoms prevents them from aggregating.
4. Simple equations can be derived to determine the equilibrium composition of the surface layer.
5. Goodmans model suggests achieving optimal selectivity with clusters of two next-nearest-neighbor Pd atoms.

1. 在没有气体的情况下，Pd原子倾向于在基体中替代Au原子。
2. CO在气相的存在有利于Pd原子位于顶层表面层。
3. Pd原子之间的弱相互作用阻止它们聚集。
4. 可以得出简单的方程来确定表面层的平衡组成。
5. 根据Goodmans模型，实现最佳选择性需要包含两个相邻最近的Pd原子的簇，并且很少有更大的簇。
