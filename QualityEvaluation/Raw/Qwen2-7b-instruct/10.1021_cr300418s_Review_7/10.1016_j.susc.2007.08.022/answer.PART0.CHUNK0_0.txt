3. "In the absence of gases Pd atoms have a strong tendency to substitute Au atoms in the bulk. The presence of CO in the gas-phase favors the presence of Pd in the top surface layer. The interaction between the Pd atoms, with or without CO on them, is very weak and they will not aggregate to form Pd islands within the surface layer, nor will they form Pd domains in the bulk."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. Oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. High ΔEv values can lead to a more efficient release of oxygen atoms, enhancing the reaction rate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences the surface's ability to adsorb and activate reactants, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧原子向反应分子的转移而起作用。氧空位（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较高的ΔEv值可以提高氧原子释放的效率，从而增强反应速率。氧空位形成所需的能量影响表面吸附和活化反应物的能力，从而影响整体催化性能。
