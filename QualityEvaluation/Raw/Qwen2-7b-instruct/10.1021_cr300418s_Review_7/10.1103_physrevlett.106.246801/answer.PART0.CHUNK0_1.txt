[1] "Early density-functional theory (DFT) calculations assumed a stabilization of the extra electrons in Ce ions next to the defect [7,9,10], while recent studies suggested the occupancy of more distant cationic sites [11-13]."
[2] "The position of the Ce3 ion pair is reflected in characteristic defect patterns observed in empty-state STM images, which arise from the bright appearance of Ce4 ions next to the defect while the Ce3 remain dark."
[3] "The reduction of ceria can be followed with photoelectron spectroscopy, by using the presence of filled Ce 4f states or characteristic shifts in the Ce 3d core levels as a measure [5,6]."
[4] "Both findings demonstrate that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy."
[5] "The driving force for adopting such open configurations is the better ability of the system to relax lattice strain induced by the more spacious Ce3 ion compared to its Ce4 counterpart."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the transfer of oxygen from an oxygen vacancy to a reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity of the oxide surface, as it facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the mechanism to proceed efficiently. This energy barrier essentially dictates how readily oxygen can be abstracted from the oxide surface, impacting the overall reaction rate and selectivity.

2. The localization of excess electrons in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy is confirmed through scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theory (DFT) studies. This finding is critical as it suggests that electrons are not strictly localized near the oxygen vacancy, challenging previous assumptions based on early density-functional theory calculations.

3. Photoelectron spectroscopy can be utilized to track the reduction of ceria by observing the presence of filled Ce 4f states or characteristic shifts in the Ce 3d core levels. This technique provides spatially averaged information about the electronic properties of defects in the ceria surface, offering insights into the redox behavior of the material.

4. The study demonstrates that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not next to the oxygen vacancy, indicating that the spatial correlation between oxygen defects and associated Ce3 ion pairs is more complex than previously thought.

5. The better ability of the system to relax lattice strain induced by the more spacious Ce3 ion compared to its Ce4 counterpart is the driving force behind adopting open configurations in the structure of ceria. This aspect is important for understanding the structural stability and reactivity of ceria under various conditions, particularly in catalytic applications.

1. 汽车范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及从氧空位向反应物分子转移氧气。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面的高反应性，因为它使得更容易形成氧空位，这对机制的顺利进行至关重要。这一能量壁垒决定了氧从氧化物表面提取的容易程度，影响整体反应速率和选择性。

2. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和密度泛函理论（DFT）研究表明，多余电子局部化在与氧空位相邻的Ce离子之外的一个Ce离子上。这一发现表明，电子并不严格局限于靠近氧空位的位置，这挑战了基于早期密度泛函理论计算的假设。

3. 可以通过光电子能谱法跟踪铈的还原，观察到填充的Ce 4f状态或Ce 3d核心能级的特征变化。这种方法提供了关于缺陷在铈表面的电子性质的空间平均信息，为理解材料的还原行为提供了见解。

4. 研究证明至少一个多余的电子局部化在一个与氧空位不相邻的Ce离子上，表明氧缺陷及其相关Ce3离子对之间的空间相关性比以前认为的更为复杂。

5. 引起系统采用开放结构配置的原因是Ce3离子相比其Ce4同位素更好的缓解由更宽敞的Ce3离子引起的晶格应力。这一方面对于理解在各种条件下铈的结构稳定性和活性至关重要，尤其是在催化剂应用中。
