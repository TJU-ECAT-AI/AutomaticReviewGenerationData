[1] "The two Ce3 ions can occupy different cationic shells around the vacancy."
[2] "The resulting variation in the chemical environment leads to a splitting of the filled Ce3 f levels, which is detected with STM spectroscopy."
[3] "Both findings demonstrate that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy."
[4] "On defective ceria, also filled f states should appear at the position of the Ce3 ions."
[5] "However, no information on the electronic properties of the defects was acquired in this case, and the question of electron localization remained unsolved."
[6] "In this work, we use a combined STM and DFT approach to provide insight into the spatial correlation between O defects and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a CeO2 (111) surface."
[7] "We find six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair with defect-formation energies below 2.6 eV (Table I)."
[8] "The localization of the Ce3 ions with respect to the defect is not deduced from the splitting that is sensitive only to differences in the local environment."
[9] "The reason for the enhanced contrast of the latter has been clarified with cluster calculations for the 21  21 ion pair, performed with PBE0 hybrid functionals and an electrostatic embedding method."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the oxidation of an organic compound to generate and activate oxygen atoms. These activated oxygen atoms then react with other molecules to facilitate the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values indicate that more energy is needed to create oxygen vacancies, potentially leading to a decrease in the rate of oxygen atom activation and, consequently, a reduction in the catalyst's efficiency and oxidizing power. Conversely, lower ΔEv values suggest easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which could enhance the catalyst's ability to produce and utilize oxygen atoms effectively, thereby increasing its catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用有机化合物氧化释放的能量来生成和活化氧原子。这些活化的氧原子随后与其它分子反应，促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化剂的活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。更高的ΔEv值意味着需要更多的能量来形成氧空位，这可能导致氧原子激活速率降低，从而减小催化剂的效率和氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv值表明更容易形成氧空位，这可以增强催化剂产生并有效利用氧原子的能力，从而提高其催化活性和氧化能力。
