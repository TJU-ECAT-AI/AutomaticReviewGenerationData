[1] "Ceria films are prepared in an excess of O2 and exhibit only a small defect concentration. Oxygen vacancies are thus generated by injecting 50 eV electrons (1 mC dose) at 100 K."
[2] "The position of the Ce3 ion pair is reflected in characteristic defect patterns observed in empty-state STM images, which arise from the bright appearance of Ce4 ions next to the defect while the Ce3 remain dark."
[3] "Both findings demonstrate that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy."
[4] "In ceria nanoclusters, the Ce3 ions were found to form preferentially at low-coordinated edge sites, even if the O vacancy is far away."
[5] "In this work, we use a combined STM and DFT approach to provide insight into the spatial correlation between O defects and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a CeO2 (111) surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the breaking of the O-O bond in water molecules to facilitate the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can lead to a higher concentration of localized electrons. These electrons can participate in the oxidation reactions, enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用水分子中O-O键断裂释放的能量来促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更加稳定，可以导致局部电子浓度的增加。这些电子可以参与氧化反应，从而提高氧化物表面的催化效率和氧化能力。
