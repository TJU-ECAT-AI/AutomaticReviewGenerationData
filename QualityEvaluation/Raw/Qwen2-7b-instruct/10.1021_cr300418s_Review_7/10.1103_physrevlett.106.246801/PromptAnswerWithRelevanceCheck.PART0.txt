[1] "Ceria films are prepared in an excess of O2 and exhibit only a small defect concentration. Oxygen vacancies are thus generated by injecting 50 eV electrons (1 mC dose) at 100 K."
[2] "The position of the Ce3 ion pair is reflected in characteristic defect patterns observed in empty-state STM images, which arise from the bright appearance of Ce4 ions next to the defect while the Ce3 remain dark."
[3] "Both findings demonstrate that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy."
[4] "In ceria nanoclusters, the Ce3 ions were found to form preferentially at low-coordinated edge sites, even if the O vacancy is far away."
[5] "In this work, we use a combined STM and DFT approach to provide insight into the spatial correlation between O defects and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a CeO2 (111) surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the breaking of the O-O bond in water molecules to facilitate the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can lead to a higher concentration of localized electrons. These electrons can participate in the oxidation reactions, enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the transfer of oxygen from an oxygen vacancy to a reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity of the oxide surface, as it facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are crucial for the mechanism to proceed efficiently. This energy barrier essentially dictates how readily oxygen can be abstracted from the oxide surface, impacting the overall reaction rate and selectivity.

2. The localization of excess electrons in a Ce ion that is not adjacent to the O vacancy is confirmed through scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM) and density-functional theory (DFT) studies. This finding is critical as it suggests that electrons are not strictly localized near the oxygen vacancy, challenging previous assumptions based on early density-functional theory calculations.

3. Photoelectron spectroscopy can be utilized to track the reduction of ceria by observing the presence of filled Ce 4f states or characteristic shifts in the Ce 3d core levels. This technique provides spatially averaged information about the electronic properties of defects in the ceria surface, offering insights into the redox behavior of the material.

4. The study demonstrates that at least one excess electron localizes in a Ce ion that is not next to the oxygen vacancy, indicating that the spatial correlation between oxygen defects and associated Ce3 ion pairs is more complex than previously thought.

5. The better ability of the system to relax lattice strain induced by the more spacious Ce3 ion compared to its Ce4 counterpart is the driving force behind adopting open configurations in the structure of ceria. This aspect is important for understanding the structural stability and reactivity of ceria under various conditions, particularly in catalytic applications.

1. 汽车范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及从氧空位向反应物分子转移氧气。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面的高反应性，因为它使得更容易形成氧空位，这对机制的顺利进行至关重要。这一能量壁垒决定了氧从氧化物表面提取的容易程度，影响整体反应速率和选择性。

2. 扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和密度泛函理论（DFT）研究表明，多余电子局部化在与氧空位相邻的Ce离子之外的一个Ce离子上。这一发现表明，电子并不严格局限于靠近氧空位的位置，这挑战了基于早期密度泛函理论计算的假设。

3. 可以通过光电子能谱法跟踪铈的还原，观察到填充的Ce 4f状态或Ce 3d核心能级的特征变化。这种方法提供了关于缺陷在铈表面的电子性质的空间平均信息，为理解材料的还原行为提供了见解。

4. 研究证明至少一个多余的电子局部化在一个与氧空位不相邻的Ce离子上，表明氧缺陷及其相关Ce3离子对之间的空间相关性比以前认为的更为复杂。

5. 引起系统采用开放结构配置的原因是Ce3离子相比其Ce4同位素更好的缓解由更宽敞的Ce3离子引起的晶格应力。这一方面对于理解在各种条件下铈的结构稳定性和活性至关重要，尤其是在催化剂应用中。

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy plays a crucial role in the stability and reactivity of the oxide, influencing how effectively it can promote oxidation processes. Higher ΔEv typically correlates with increased catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, as it facilitates the release of lattice oxygen and the formation of active sites on the surface that are capable of efficiently converting reactants into products.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the surface chemistry and structure. When an oxygen vacancy is formed, it leaves behind two electrons, leading to the stabilization of these electrons in specific locations on the surface. These electrons can either localize in Ce ions adjacent to the defect or in more distant cationic sites, depending on the computational approach used. Recent studies have shown that the electrons may localize in Ce ions that are not directly next to the defect, which is a finding that challenges earlier assumptions and provides deeper insights into electron localization phenomena. This localization affects the electronic properties of the defects, which in turn influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By understanding the specific configurations of the Ce3 ion pairs and their relationship to ΔEv, researchers can optimize the design of oxide catalysts for improved performance in oxidation reactions.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式，通过氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这种能量在促进氧化过程方面起着关键作用，影响氧化物的表面化学和结构，进而决定了其催化活性和氧化能力的强弱。较高的ΔEv通常与增强的催化活性和更强的氧化能力相关联，因为它促进了晶格氧的释放和表面活性位点的形成，这些位点能够高效地将反应物转化为产物。

2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时的重要性在于它对表面化学和结构的影响。当形成一个氧空位时，会留下两个电子，这些电子在表面特定位置被稳定化。这些电子可能局部化在与缺陷相邻的铈离子中，也可能在更远的阳离子位点上，这取决于所采用的计算方法。近期的研究表明，电子可能局部化在与缺陷不直接相邻的铈离子中，这一发现挑战了早期的观点，并为理解电子定位现象提供了更深入的见解。这种定位会影响缺陷的电子性质，进而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。通过理解铈3离子对之间的特定配置及其与ΔEv的关系，研究人员可以优化氧化催化剂的设计，以提高其在氧化反应中的性能。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the oxidation of an organic compound to generate and activate oxygen atoms. These activated oxygen atoms then react with other molecules to facilitate the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values indicate that more energy is needed to create oxygen vacancies, potentially leading to a decrease in the rate of oxygen atom activation and, consequently, a reduction in the catalyst's efficiency and oxidizing power. Conversely, lower ΔEv values suggest easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which could enhance the catalyst's ability to produce and utilize oxygen atoms effectively, thereby increasing its catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.
