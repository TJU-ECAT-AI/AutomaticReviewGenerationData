[1] "Early density-functional theory (DFT) calculations assumed a stabilization of the extra electrons in Ce ions next to the defect [7,9,10], while recent studies suggested the occupancy of more distant cationic sites [1113]."
[2] "In this work, we use a combined STM and DFT approach to provide insight into the spatial correlation between O defects and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a CeO2 (111) surface. We demonstrate that electrons left behind upon vacancy formation occupy Ce sites that are not in a next-neighbor position to the defect."
[3] "The reduction of ceria can be followed with photoelectron spectroscopy, by using the presence of filled Ce 4f states or characteristic shifts in the Ce 3d core levels as a measure [5,6]."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. This energy is crucial as it determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
2. Recent studies have shown that electrons left behind upon the formation of an oxygen vacancy do not necessarily occupy the nearest Ce ion sites to the defect. Instead, they can localize in Ce sites that are not in a next-neighbor position to the defect, demonstrating the spatial correlation between oxygen defects and the associated Ce3 ion pairs.
3. The reduction of ceria can be monitored through photoelectron spectroscopy by observing the presence of filled Ce 4f states or characteristic shifts in the Ce 3d core levels, which provide spatially averaged information on the electronic properties of the defects.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过利用氧空位（ΔEv）形成释放的能量来推动反应。这种能量决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
2. 近期的研究表明，氧空位形成后留下的电子并不一定占据紧邻缺陷的Ce离子位置。相反，它们可以局部化在远离缺陷的Ce离子位置上，展示了氧缺陷与相关Ce3离子对之间的空间关联。
3. 可以通过光电子能谱技术监测铈的还原过程，观察填充的Ce 4f状态或Ce 3d核心能级的特征位移，这些信息提供了关于缺陷电子特性的空间平均值。
