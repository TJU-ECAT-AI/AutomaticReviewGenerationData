<p>Early density-functional theory (DFT) calculations assumed a stabilisation of the extra electrons in Ce ions next to the defect [7,9,10], while recent studies suggested the occupancy of more distant cationic sites [11-13]. In ceria nanoclusters, the Ce3 ions were found to form preferentially at low-coordinated edge sites, even if the O vacancy is far away [14]. Those differences demonstrate the sensitivity of electron-localization phenomena on the computational approach.</p>
<p>In this work, we use a combined STM and DFT approach to provide insight into the spatial correlation between O defects and the associated Ce3 ion pair in a CeO2 (111) surface. We demonstrate that electrons left behind upon vacancy formation occupy Ce sites that are not in a next-neighbor position to the defect.</p>
<p>Also, subsurface vacancies that appear as three protruding maxima at negative bias are occasionally observed but have been disregarded in this study.</p>
<p>The electronic properties of surface defects are analyzed with STM conductance spectroscopy performed with the lock-in technique (10 mV=1073 Hz).</p>
<p>While the dI=dV maximum at 2.3 V reflects the empty Ce 4f band, the peaks around 1:5 V are assigned to filled f states.</p>
<p>We find six configurations of the Ce3 ion pair with defect-formation energies below 2.6 eV (Table I).</p>
<p>From those results, it becomes clear why the experimental spectra show either a double- or a single-peak structure. The two Ce3 ions in spec 1 of Fig. 2(b) are apparently located in rather different environments, while the pair in spec 2 has a comparable CN.</p>
<p>However, this configuration has not been detected in the experiment.</p>
<p>Our results bring the long-standing puzzle on electron localisation in defective CeO2 surfaces closer to a final answer.</p>

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy plays a crucial role in the stability and reactivity of the oxide, influencing how effectively it can promote oxidation processes. Higher ΔEv typically correlates with increased catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, as it facilitates the release of lattice oxygen and the formation of active sites on the surface that are capable of efficiently converting reactants into products.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the surface chemistry and structure. When an oxygen vacancy is formed, it leaves behind two electrons, leading to the stabilization of these electrons in specific locations on the surface. These electrons can either localize in Ce ions adjacent to the defect or in more distant cationic sites, depending on the computational approach used. Recent studies have shown that the electrons may localize in Ce ions that are not directly next to the defect, which is a finding that challenges earlier assumptions and provides deeper insights into electron localization phenomena. This localization affects the electronic properties of the defects, which in turn influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By understanding the specific configurations of the Ce3 ion pairs and their relationship to ΔEv, researchers can optimize the design of oxide catalysts for improved performance in oxidation reactions.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式，通过氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这种能量在促进氧化过程方面起着关键作用，影响氧化物的表面化学和结构，进而决定了其催化活性和氧化能力的强弱。较高的ΔEv通常与增强的催化活性和更强的氧化能力相关联，因为它促进了晶格氧的释放和表面活性位点的形成，这些位点能够高效地将反应物转化为产物。

2. ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时的重要性在于它对表面化学和结构的影响。当形成一个氧空位时，会留下两个电子，这些电子在表面特定位置被稳定化。这些电子可能局部化在与缺陷相邻的铈离子中，也可能在更远的阳离子位点上，这取决于所采用的计算方法。近期的研究表明，电子可能局部化在与缺陷不直接相邻的铈离子中，这一发现挑战了早期的观点，并为理解电子定位现象提供了更深入的见解。这种定位会影响缺陷的电子性质，进而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。通过理解铈3离子对之间的特定配置及其与ΔEv的关系，研究人员可以优化氧化催化剂的设计，以提高其在氧化反应中的性能。
