[IV] "It seems that this is mostly related to a different description of the binding in the O2 molecule for the hybrid and PBE functionals."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
4. This seems largely due to a distinct description of the binding in the O2 molecule by hybrid and PBE functionals.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>
