<p>It has been argued that these discrepancies are related to the overestimation of the exchange splitting in d atoms, with a simultaneous increase of the spin-polarization energy.33 Thus, the spin-polarized free atom is overstabilized compared to an artificial non-spin-polarized one.</p>
<p>Note that errors in the atomic Ce energies will not affect the formation energies reported below.</p>
<p>Tentatively, it is, however, clear that the PBE functional underestimates the formation energies and overestimates the reduction energy HCeO2Ce2O3 albeit only slightly.</p>
<p>Although such considerations are necessarily rather speculative, they demonstrate that the agreement on the PBE level is fortuitous and not related to a proper description of the underlying bonding properties of CeO2 and Ce2O3.</p>
<p>For the hybrid functionals, the equilibrium volume usually lies in between the LDA and GGA values, but for Ce2O3 the volume increases from the GGA to HSE and PBE0 results.</p>
<p>Specifically, the CeO2 band gap Eg =5.3 eV in DFT+U is smaller than the experimental one 6.0 eV and much smaller than the PBE0 and HSE values 7.9 and 7.0 eV.</p>
<p>In the case of Ce2O3, the deviations are less severe. In particular, the DFT+U Eg-f gap equals 2.4 LDA +U and 2.6 eV PBE+U, while the experimental value and HSE values are 2.4 and 2.5 eV, respectively.</p>
<p>However, as always, the results depend on the U parameter. The equilibrium lattice constants, the position of the occupied or unoccupied 4f states in the band gap, and the reduction energy vary linearly with the effective Hubbard U values.</p>
<p>For the prediction of thermochemical properties, the hybrid functionals do not appear to provide a clear-cut improvement over the standard PBE functional, although comparison with experiments is rather difficult, since the experimental formation energies are not known very accurately.</p>

1. Discrepancies in the atomization energy calculations are attributed to the overestimation of the exchange splitting in d atoms and an increase in the spin-polarization energy. The spin-polarized free atom is found to be overstabilized compared to an artificially non-spin-polarized one.
2. The PBE functional underestimates formation energies and overestimates the reduction energy HCeO2Ce2O3, though the overestimation is minimal.
3. The agreement of the PBE functional on the formation energies and reduction energy is considered fortuitous and not indicative of a proper description of the bonding properties of CeO2 and Ce2O3.
4. For Ce2O3, the equilibrium volume calculated using the hybrid functionals shows an unusual behavior, increasing from the GGA to HSE and PBE0 results.
5. The hybrid functionals predict a larger band gap for CeO2 compared to experimental values, while for Ce2O3, the deviations are less pronounced.
6. The DFT+U approach yields results that depend on the effective Hubbard U value, affecting equilibrium lattice constants, band gap positions, and reduction energy.
7. The hybrid functionals do not provide a clear advantage over the PBE functional in predicting thermochemical properties, especially concerning formation energies, due to the difficulty in comparing experimental values.

1. 计算中的原子化能差异归因于对d原子交换分裂的高估和自旋极化能的增加。自旋极化自由原子比人工非自旋极化的原子更稳定。
2. PBE方法低估了形成能并高估了氧化反应能量 HCeO2Ce2O3，但过高的估计程度较小。
3. 对于形成能和氧化反应能量的PBE方法的同意被认为是偶然的，并不能反映CeO2和Ce2O3的底层键合性质的适当描述。
4. 对于Ce2O3，使用混合方法计算的平衡体积显示出异常行为，从GGA到HSE和PBE0结果增加。
5. 对于CeO2，混合方法预测的带隙比实验值大，而对于Ce2O3，偏差较小。
6. DFT+U方法的结果依赖于有效Hubbard U值，影响平衡晶格常数、带隙位置和氧化还原能。
7. 混合方法在预测热化学性质时并没有明显优于PBE方法的优势，尤其是由于实验值难以比较，形成能的预测存在困难。
