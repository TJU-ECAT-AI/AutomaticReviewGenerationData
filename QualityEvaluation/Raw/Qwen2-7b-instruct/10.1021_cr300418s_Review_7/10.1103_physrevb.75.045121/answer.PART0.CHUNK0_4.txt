[1] "The quantitive prediction of the chemical and physical properties of systems containing multivalent metals, in par- ticular lanthanide species, requires an accurate description of the f states and has been a challenge to density functional theory DFT calculations."
[2] "The local density LDA and generalized gradient GGA approximations to the exchange-correlation XC energy functional often yield a qualitatively incorrect behavior for the case in which the f-orbital overlaps are small, the bands narrow, and the electrons nearly localize."
[3] "The equilibrium volumes of both structures are in very good agreement with experiments, improving upon the description of the LDA and GGA."
[4] "The calculated CeO2 O 2pCe 5d and Ce2O3 Ce 4f-5d4f band gaps are larger by up to 45% PBE0 and 15% HSE than found in experiments."
[5] "Furthermore, we calculate atomization energies, heats of formation, and the reduction energy of 2CeO2Ce2O3+1/2O2. The latter is underestimated by 0.40.9 eV with respect to available experimental data at room temperature."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. This energy facilitates the adsorption of oxygen molecules, leading to their subsequent oxidation and the formation of reactive oxygen species. The ΔEv plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because a lower ΔEv indicates a higher affinity for oxygen adsorption and a greater capacity for the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates, thus enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power of the oxide catalyst.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位（ΔEv）形成时释放的能量来操作。这种能量有助于氧分子的吸附，进而导致它们的氧化和活性氧中间体的形成。ΔEv对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为较低的ΔEv表示对氧吸附的更高亲和力以及形成活性氧中间体的能力更强，从而增强氧化催化剂的催化效率和氧化能力。
