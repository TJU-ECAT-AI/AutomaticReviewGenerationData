1. An understanding of how oxygen vacancy defects influence the properties of ceria is still lacking, despite its importance in automotive catalysis.

2. The reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is more energetically favorable in the low index surfaces compared to the bulk, necessitating knowledge about the nature of both pure and reduced ceria surfaces.

3. For the purpose of studying surface structure, thin films of ceria have been grown on various support materials such as alumina, yttrium stabilized zirconia, platinum, and palladium.

4. Upon partial reduction, it is expected that the two cerium atoms next to the vacancy will be reduced to Ce(III).

5. The (111) surface was studied by Norenberg and Briggs using STM, finding no significant lateral relaxation and oxygen termination of the surface.

6. In the current work, the PW91 GGA and a value of U were used, which localized two electrons in the Ce4f states for each oxygen vacancy, matching the experimental UPS spectra [3,13].

7. With U values ranging from 27 eV, the degree of delocalization decreased with increasing U. For U < 5 eV, significant delocalization persisted, whereas for U = 5 eV and higher, the results were essentially converged, showing localization independent of the U value choice.

8. With DFT+U, the calculated oxygen vacancy formation energy was 4.55 eV, a decrease of 0.83 eV from the GGA-calculated value of 5.38 eV.

1. 对于汽车催化而言，氧空位缺陷如何改变铈的性质的理解仍然不足。

2. 在低指数表面中，铈的减少和氧离子迁移的能量更有利于在基质中，因此需要了解纯铈和减少铈表面的性质。

3. 为了研究表面结构，已经将铈薄膜生长在诸如氧化铝、钇稳定氧化锆、铂和钯等支持材料上。

4. 预计在部分减少后，靠近空位的两个铈原子会减少到Ce(III)状态。

5. Norenberg和Briggs使用STM研究了（111）表面，发现没有显著的横向松弛，并且该表面被氧气终止。

6. 在当前工作中，使用了PW91 GGA和一个U值，该值使每个氧空位的两个电子局部化在Ce4f状态下，与实验UPS光谱[3,13]匹配。

7. 对于从27 eV变化的U值，随着U值的增加，去局域化程度下降。对于U < 5 eV，显著的去局域化仍然存在，而当U = 5 eV或更高时，结果基本上收敛，在这种情况下，局部化独立于U值选择。

8. 使用DFT+U，计算的氧空位形成能为4.55 eV，比GGA计算的值5.38 eV减少了0.83 eV。
