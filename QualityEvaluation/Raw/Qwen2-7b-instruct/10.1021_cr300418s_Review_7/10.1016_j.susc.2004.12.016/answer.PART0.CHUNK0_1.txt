[1] "Despite the fundamental importance of these species to automotive catalysis, an understanding of how oxygen vacancy defects modify the properties of ceria is still lacking."
[2] "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."
[3] "In order to correctly describe the localisation of these electrons, we use the DFT+U [36] methodology to correct this failing of DFT for the (100) surface of ceria."

1. An understanding of how oxygen vacancy defects impact the properties of ceria is currently insufficient despite their crucial role in automotive catalysis. 
2. The reduction of ceria and the migration of oxygen ions are more favorable in the low index surfaces compared to the bulk, hence it is essential to comprehend the characteristics of both pure and reduced ceria surfaces.
3. To accurately depict the localization of these electrons, the DFT+U methodology was employed, addressing the limitations of standard DFT for the (100) surface of ceria.

1. 对于汽车催化而言，这些物种的基本重要性不言而喻，但对于氧空位缺陷如何改变氧化铈的性质的理解仍然不足。
2. 在低指数表面中，铈的还原和氧离子迁移的能量优势与在基体相比更为显著，因此理解纯铈和还原铈表面的性质变得至关重要。
3. 为了正确描述这些电子的局域化，使用了DFT+U方法学来修正标准DFT在铈的（100）表面存在的问题。
