[1] "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."
[2] "The electronic structure resulting from GGA-DFT gives rise to a DOS with no gap state between the valance band and the conduction band with the Ce4f states crossing the Fermi level."
[3] "To correctly describe the electronic structure of the vacancy defect, we apply the DFT+U methodology [36], which is one approach to correct for the inability of approximate DFT to properly describe strongly localised systems [47]."
[4] "Using values of U in the range of 27 eV we have found that the degree of delocalisation decreases with increasing U. For U < 5 eV, significant delocalisation still persists,while for U = 5 eV and greater, the results are essentially converged, in that localisation is found to be essentially independent of the choice of U."
[5] "The DFT+U approach results in an energy gap of 0.90 eV from the top of the valence band to the new Ce4f gap state and an essentially unchanged band gap of 5 eV from the valence band to the Ce5d conduction band."
[6] "Comparing the geometry of the defective surface optimised with DFT+U to the geometry of the pure (100) surface, we find for the defective surface that the CeO distances neighbouring the vacancy are shortened by 0.60%."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to enhance the reaction rate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When the ΔEv is low, it indicates a high efficiency in oxygen vacancy formation, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to improved oxygen availability for the reaction. Conversely, a high ΔEv suggests a lower efficiency in oxygen vacancy formation, potentially limiting the catalytic performance of the oxide surface. Therefore, optimizing the ΔEv is essential for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位的形成（ΔEv）来提高反应速率。氧空位形成所需的能量决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当ΔEv较低时，表明氧空位形成效率高，从而提高了催化活性和氧化能力，因为这能更好地提供氧气以促进反应。相反，当ΔEv较高时，表明氧空位形成的效率较低，可能限制了氧化物表面的催化性能。因此，优化ΔEv对于增强氧化物催化氧化反应的效率和有效性至关重要。
