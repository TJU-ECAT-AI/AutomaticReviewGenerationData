[1] "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."
[2] "In order to facilitate the study of surface structure, thin films of ceria have been grown on a number of support materials including alumina,yttrium stabilised zirconia, platinum and palladium [6-8]."
[3] "It has been determined through STM [10], AFM [11], ion scattering spectroscopy [12] and low energy electron diffraction [13] that the (111) surface is oxygen terminated."
[4] "Evidence for the appearance of naturally occurring oxygen defects was derived from the nature of the bright spots in the STM image coupled to atomistic simulations."
[5] "The defective (111) surface has also been studied by No renberg and Briggs with STM [17]. No significant lateral relaxation of the surface was observed and oxygen termination of this surface was found."
[6] "The localisation of Ce4f electrons modifies the predicted structure of the defective surface."
[7] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV,which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."
[8] "The differing structures found for GGA-DFT and DFT+U are consistent with the localisation of CeIII states and demonstrate the importance of self-consistent relaxations with DFT+U."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the adsorption of an oxygen molecule on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen vacancy can be easily formed, enhancing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the adsorption of an oxygen molecule on the oxide catalyst surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences the catalyst's activity and oxidizing capacity. Lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, boosting the surface's catalytic performance and oxidizing strength.
