[1] "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."
[2] "The electronic structure resulting from GGA-DFT gives rise to a DOS with no gap state between the valance band and the conduction band with the Ce4f states crossing the Fermi level."
[3] "To correctly describe the electronic structure of the vacancy defect, we apply the DFT+U methodology [36], which is one approach to correct for the inability of approximate DFT to properly describe strongly localised systems [47]."
[4] "Using values of U in the range of 27 eV we have found that the degree of delocalisation decreases with increasing U. For U < 5 eV, significant delocalisation still persists,while for U = 5 eV and greater, the results are essentially converged, in that localisation is found to be essentially independent of the choice of U."
[5] "The DFT+U approach results in an energy gap of 0.90 eV from the top of the valence band to the new Ce4f gap state and an essentially unchanged band gap of 5 eV from the valence band to the Ce5d conduction band."
[6] "Comparing the geometry of the defective surface optimised with DFT+U to the geometry of the pure (100) surface, we find for the defective surface that the CeO distances neighbouring the vacancy are shortened by 0.60%."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to enhance the reaction rate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When the ΔEv is low, it indicates a high efficiency in oxygen vacancy formation, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to improved oxygen availability for the reaction. Conversely, a high ΔEv suggests a lower efficiency in oxygen vacancy formation, potentially limiting the catalytic performance of the oxide surface. Therefore, optimizing the ΔEv is essential for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactants, allowing the formation of oxides. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it influences the stability and reactivity of the surface.

2. Upon reduction of ceria, oxygen vacancies are formed, causing a reversible change in the oxidation state of cerium from Ce(IV) to Ce(III). This process is energetically favorable in the low index surfaces compared to the bulk.

3. Applying the DFT+U methodology to the oxygen vacancy defect in the (100) surface of ceria results in the localization of two electrons in the Ce4f states for each oxygen vacancy. This corresponds to the electronic structure observed in experimental UPS spectra.

4. The DFT+U approach reduces the calculated formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria from 5.38 eV (using GGA) to 4.55 eV, indicating a decrease of 0.83 eV.
