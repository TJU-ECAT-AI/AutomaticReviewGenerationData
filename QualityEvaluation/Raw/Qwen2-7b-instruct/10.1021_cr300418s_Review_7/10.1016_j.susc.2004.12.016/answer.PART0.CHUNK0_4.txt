[1] "Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is energetically favourable in the low index surfaces compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure and reduced ceria surfaces."
[2] "Upon reduction of ceria,oxygen vacancies are formed [1]. In this reaction the oxidation state of Ce changes reversibly from Ce(IV) to Ce(III), the reaction being Ox O  2Cex Ce ! V O  2Ce0 Ce  1"
[3] "In the present work, we use a value of U that leads to localisation of two electrons in the Ce4f states for each oxygen vacancy and an electronic structure corresponding to that observed in experimental UPS spectra [3,13]."
[4] "With DFT+U, the calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV,which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated GGA value of 5.38 eV."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactants, allowing the formation of oxides. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it influences the stability and reactivity of the surface.

2. Upon reduction of ceria, oxygen vacancies are formed, causing a reversible change in the oxidation state of cerium from Ce(IV) to Ce(III). This process is energetically favorable in the low index surfaces compared to the bulk.

3. Applying the DFT+U methodology to the oxygen vacancy defect in the (100) surface of ceria results in the localization of two electrons in the Ce4f states for each oxygen vacancy. This corresponds to the electronic structure observed in experimental UPS spectra.

4. The DFT+U approach reduces the calculated formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in ceria from 5.38 eV (using GGA) to 4.55 eV, indicating a decrease of 0.83 eV.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面与反应物之间的电子和氧转移，从而促进氧化物的形成。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为它影响表面的稳定性和反应性。

2. 在铈的还原过程中，会形成氧空位，导致铈的氧化状态从Ce(IV)可逆地转变为Ce(III)。这一过程在低指数表面中的能效高于其晶格。

3. 将DFT+U方法应用于铈氧化物（100）表面的氧缺陷，结果是每个氧空位在铈4f状态中局部化两个电子。这对应于实验UPS光谱中观察到的电子结构。

4. 使用DFT+U方法计算的铈氧化物中氧空位的形成能从使用GGA计算的5.38 eV减少至4.55 eV，表明减少了0.83 eV。
