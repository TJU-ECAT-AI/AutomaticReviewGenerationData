[1] "The crystal plane of ceria plays an essential role in determining its catalytic oxidation properties."
[2] "In the case of the CeO2 nanorods, the predominantly exposed planes are the well-defined and less stable {001} and {110} planes, whereas in the CeO2 nanoparticles the most stable {111} planes are predominantly exposed."
[3] "CeO2 nanorods show higher CO oxidation activity than CeO2 nanoparticles because of their more reactive planes."
[4] "The present results suggest that catalysts may be designed rather than prepared because of the recent development of morphology-controlled synthesis of nanostructured materials."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the oxygen vacancy is easily formed, leading to an efficient reduction of oxygen molecules to form highly reactive atomic oxygen, which then facilitates the oxidation reaction. This mechanism explains how the presence of reactive crystal planes, such as {001} and {110} in CeO2 nanorods, enhances the catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to CeO2 nanoparticles, where the predominant crystal plane is {111}. The design of catalysts with well-defined reactive crystal planes, as demonstrated in CeO2 nanorods, allows for better control of the catalytic properties and improved efficiency in heterogeneous catalysis processes.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧空位易于形成，导致氧气分子的有效还原，形成高度活性的原子氧，从而促进氧化反应。这一机制解释了具有活性晶面（如CeO2纳米棒中的{001}和{110}）的氧化物为何能增强CO氧化活性，而CeO2纳米粒子主要以{111}晶面为主导。设计具有明确定义的活性晶面的催化剂，如CeO2纳米棒，允许更好地控制催化性质并提高异相催化过程的效率。
