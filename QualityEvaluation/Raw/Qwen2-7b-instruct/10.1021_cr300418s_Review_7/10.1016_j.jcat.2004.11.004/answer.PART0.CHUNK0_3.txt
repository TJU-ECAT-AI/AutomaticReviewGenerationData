[1] "In the case of CeO2 nanorods, the more reactive planes are exposed."
[2] "Moreover, the stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indicates the reactive planes can be well protected. Thus a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle can easily be maintained to generate better catalytic performance during reaction."
[3] "The present results suggest that catalysts may be designed rather than prepared because of the recent development of morphology-controlled synthesis of nanostructured materials."
[4] "Through the control of a few critical synthesis parameters, nanomaterials with predictable morphologies, namely well-defined crystal planes, can be obtained, and the use of these materials as model catalysts in laboratory investigations as well as practical applications becomes possible."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When a molecule of oxygen binds to the surface of the oxide, it can dissociate at the vacancy site, forming highly reactive atomic oxygen. This atomic oxygen then reacts with the substrate, driving the oxidation reaction forward. The significance of ΔEv lies in its influence on the stability and reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance of the oxide catalyst.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来操作。这一能量决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当分子氧结合到氧化物的表面上时，它可以在空位位置分解，形成高度活性的原子氧。然后，这种原子氧与基质反应，推动氧化反应向前进行。ΔEv的意义在于其对表面氧原子的稳定性和反应性的影响，从而影响氧化物催化剂的整体催化性能。
