[1] "The crystal plane of ceria plays an essential role in determining its catalytic oxidation properties."
[2] "HRTEM studies reveal that the predominantly exposed planes are the unusually reactive {001} and {110} in the CeO2 nanorods rather than the stable {111} in the irregular nanoparticles."
[3] "Consequently, it is demonstrated that the CeO2 nanorods are more reactive for CO oxidation than their counterparts, irregular nanoparticles."
[4] "Moreover, the stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indicates the reactive planes can be well protected."
[5] "Thus a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle can easily be maintained to generate better catalytic performance during reaction."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the case of ceria nanorods, the presence of reactive crystal planes such as {001} and {110} leads to higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to ceria nanoparticles with predominantly {111} planes. The stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indicates that the reactive planes can be well protected, allowing for a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle to maintain better catalytic performance during the reaction.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物表面的氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运作。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要作用。在铈氧化物纳米棒的情况下，暴露的活性晶面如{001}和{110}导致CO氧化反应更高的催化活性与主要暴露{111}平面的铈氧化物纳米粒子相比。由TPR分析揭示的稳定还原性表明，活性平面可以得到很好的保护，允许维持稳定的Ce4+/Ce3+循环以在反应期间保持更好的催化性能。
