The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of ceria nanorods, the {001} and {110} crystal planes are more reactive due to their lower energy compared to the {111} plane. The stable redox property of ceria nanorods ensures a well-protected reactive plane, maintaining a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle for better catalytic performance. The {111} planes in irregular nanoparticles, being less reactive, result in a lower activity compared to ceria nanorods with well-defined reactive planes.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the oxygen vacancy is easily formed, leading to an efficient reduction of oxygen molecules to form highly reactive atomic oxygen, which then facilitates the oxidation reaction. This mechanism explains how the presence of reactive crystal planes, such as {001} and {110} in CeO2 nanorods, enhances the catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to CeO2 nanoparticles, where the predominant crystal plane is {111}. The design of catalysts with well-defined reactive crystal planes, as demonstrated in CeO2 nanorods, allows for better control of the catalytic properties and improved efficiency in heterogeneous catalysis processes.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧空位易于形成，导致氧气分子的有效还原，形成高度活性的原子氧，从而促进氧化反应。这一机制解释了具有活性晶面（如CeO2纳米棒中的{001}和{110}）的氧化物为何能增强CO氧化活性，而CeO2纳米粒子主要以{111}晶面为主导。设计具有明确定义的活性晶面的催化剂，如CeO2纳米棒，允许更好地控制催化性质并提高异相催化过程的效率。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When a molecule of oxygen binds to the surface of the oxide, it can dissociate at the vacancy site, forming highly reactive atomic oxygen. This atomic oxygen then reacts with the substrate, driving the oxidation reaction forward. The significance of ΔEv lies in its influence on the stability and reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance of the oxide catalyst.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of the literature provided, the ΔEv for the {001} and {110} planes of CeO2 nanorods is lower compared to the {111} plane of CeO2 nanoparticles. This lower ΔEv facilitates easier attack and reduction of Ce4+O by CO, leading to the creation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies allow for the dissociation of O2 molecules, forming highly reactive atomic oxygen. This process enhances the catalytic activity of CeO2 nanorods due to their well-defined reactive planes. Conversely, the {111} planes of CeO2 nanoparticles have a higher ΔEv, which leads to a poorer redox property and, consequently, lower activity.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在所提供的文献背景下，CeO2纳米棒的{001}和{110}平面的ΔEv低于CeO2纳米粒子的{111}平面。这一较低的ΔEv使得Ce4+O更容易被CO攻击和还原，从而产生氧空位。这些空位允许O2分子的解离，形成高度反应性的原子氧。这个过程增强了CeO2纳米棒的催化活性，因为它们具有定义明确的活性平面。相反，CeO2纳米粒子的{111}平面的ΔEv较高，导致较差的还原性质，进而导致较低的活性。
