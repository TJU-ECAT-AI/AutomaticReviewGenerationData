[1] "The crystal plane of ceria plays an essential role in determining its catalytic oxidation properties."
[2] "In this study, single-crystalline CeO2 nanorods with well-defined crystal planes have been synthesized by a facile solution-based hydrothermal method."
[3] "HRTEM studies reveal that the predominantly exposed planes are the unusually reactive {001} and {110} in the CeO2 nanorods rather than the stable {111} in the irregular nanoparticles."
[4] "Consequently, it is demonstrated that the CeO2 nanorods are more reactive for CO oxidation than their counterparts, irregular nanoparticles."
[5] "The present results indicate that catalysts with well-defined reactive sites may be designed because of the recent development of morphology-controlled synthesis of nanostructured materials."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of ceria nanorods, the {001} and {110} crystal planes are more reactive due to their lower energy compared to the {111} plane. The stable redox property of ceria nanorods ensures a well-protected reactive plane, maintaining a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle for better catalytic performance. The {111} planes in irregular nanoparticles, being less reactive, result in a lower activity compared to ceria nanorods with well-defined reactive planes.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧空位的形成而运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。对于铈氧化物纳米棒而言，001和110晶面由于其与111平面相比更低的能量，表现出更高的反应性。铈氧化物纳米棒稳定的电荷性质确保了反应平面的良好保护，维持着稳定的Ce4+/Ce3+循环，从而实现更好的催化性能。在不规则纳米颗粒中，主要暴露的111平面由于其较低的反应性，导致活性低于具有定义明确反应晶面的铈氧化物纳米棒。
