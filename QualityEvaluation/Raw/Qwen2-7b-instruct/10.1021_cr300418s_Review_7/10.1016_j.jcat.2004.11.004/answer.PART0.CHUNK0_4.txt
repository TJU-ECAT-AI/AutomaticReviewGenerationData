[1] "In the case of CeO2 nanorods, the more reactive planes are exposed."
[2] "Moreover, the stable redox property revealed by the TPR analysis indicates the reactive planes can be well protected. Thus a stable Ce4+/Ce3+ cycle can easily be maintained to generate better catalytic performance during reaction."
[3] "On the other hand, because of the predominant {111} planes, the real redox property of the CeO2 nanoparticles is poorer than that of the nanorods, resulting in a lower activity."
[4] "According to these results, a correlation can be drawn between the catalytic performance and the crystal planes: CeO2 nanorods, with well-defined reactive planes ({001} and {110}), are more active than classical ceria nanoparticles with the {111} planes."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of the literature provided, the ΔEv for the {001} and {110} planes of CeO2 nanorods is lower compared to the {111} plane of CeO2 nanoparticles. This lower ΔEv facilitates easier attack and reduction of Ce4+O by CO, leading to the creation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies allow for the dissociation of O2 molecules, forming highly reactive atomic oxygen. This process enhances the catalytic activity of CeO2 nanorods due to their well-defined reactive planes. Conversely, the {111} planes of CeO2 nanoparticles have a higher ΔEv, which leads to a poorer redox property and, consequently, lower activity.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在所提供的文献背景下，CeO2纳米棒的{001}和{110}平面的ΔEv低于CeO2纳米粒子的{111}平面。这一较低的ΔEv使得Ce4+O更容易被CO攻击和还原，从而产生氧空位。这些空位允许O2分子的解离，形成高度反应性的原子氧。这个过程增强了CeO2纳米棒的催化活性，因为它们具有定义明确的活性平面。相反，CeO2纳米粒子的{111}平面的ΔEv较高，导致较差的还原性质，进而导致较低的活性。
