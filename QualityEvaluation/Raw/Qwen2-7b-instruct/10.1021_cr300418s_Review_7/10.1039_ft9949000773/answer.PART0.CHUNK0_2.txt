Successive reduction steps of CeO, particles by hydrogen between 300 and 1070 K have been followed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and in situ magnetic measurements on several samples with different BET surface areas.
The nature of the phases present in cerias reduced between 670 and 1270 K was determined by X-ray analysis.
Complete reoxidation by oxygen occurs at room temperature, for all reduction percentages below ca. 60/,,,i.e. as long as the reduced phase remained in the cubic form.
The structure of ceria is face-centred cubic (fluorite type). It can be described as a pile of oxygen ions, linked together by the edges, with the cerium atom at the centre of the oxygen cube in octahedral coordination.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through successive reduction steps of ceria particles by hydrogen between 300 and 1070 K, which are followed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and in situ magnetic measurements. These processes are carried out on various samples with differing BET surface areas. The phases present in ceria reduced between 670 and 1270 K are determined by X-ray analysis. Complete reoxidation by oxygen takes place at room temperature for all reduction percentages below approximately 60%, provided the reduced phase remains in the cubic form. The structure of ceria is face-centered cubic (fluorite type), described as a stack of oxygen ions connected by edges, with the cerium atom at the center of the oxygen cube in octahedral coordination.

火星-克雷韦伦机制通过在300至1070 K之间的连续还原步骤在铈氧化物粒子上进行氢还原，随后是温度程序化减少（TPR）和就地磁测量。这些过程是在具有不同比表面积的不同样品上进行的。在670至1270 K之间还原的铈氧化物的相态由X射线分析确定。所有小于约60%的还原百分比下的完全氧再氧化都在室温下发生，前提是还原相保持在立方体形式。对于所有小于大约60%的还原百分比，如果还原相保持在立方体形式，则可以在室温下进行完全氧再氧化。铈氧化物的结构是立方体中心立方型（氟石类型），描述为堆叠的氧离子通过边缘连接，铈原子位于氧立方体的中心，在八面体协调中。
