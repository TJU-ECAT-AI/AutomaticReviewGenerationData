[1] "Several studies have appeared which have focussed on elucidating the conditions of these redox processes in order to obtain a better understanding of their mechanisms."
[2] "The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective of the initial surface."
[3] "With the low-surface-area ceria, a small reduction plateau at 620 K attributed to the reduction of the ceri$i surface was observed as well as an intermediate state at a higher temperature of reduction (900 K), having the formal composition CeO, 8 3 ,  r.e. close to that of Ce,O, ,."
[4] "In the case of the 11 5 m2 g-' sample. the observation of a plateau corresponding to the reduction of the surface depended on the operating conditions, but again a stabilized composition close to CeO, g4 could be obtained at 670 K."
[5] "The reoxidation by tixygen of the reduced oxides was almost complete at room temperature."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies are energetically favorable states that require energy (ΔEv) for their creation. The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies a more stable and less reactive surface, which can lead to decreased catalytic activity but enhanced stability. Conversely, a higher ΔEv might indicate a more reactive surface, potentially increasing the catalytic efficiency but possibly compromising stability. Thus, controlling ΔEv through material synthesis or processing can fine-tune the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷韦伦机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位来运作。这些空位是能量上有利的状态，需要能量（ΔEv）来创建。ΔEv的显著性在于它对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力的影响。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更稳定且反应性较低的表面，这可能导致催化活性降低但稳定性增强。相反，较高的ΔEv可能表示更活跃的表面，可能增加催化剂的效率，但可能损害稳定性。因此，通过材料合成或加工控制ΔEv可以精确调整氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的性能。
