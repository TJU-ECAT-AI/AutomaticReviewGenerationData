[1] "In such systems, cerium oxide behaves as an oxygen partial pressure regulator."
[2] "The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective of the initial surface."
[3] "A new intermediate phase, cubic Ce,O,, was also observed on samples reduced at 1070-1 170 K."
[4] "When the reduction progresses further into the bulk, two main phases were evidenced: first, an expanded cubic CeO,-,phase derived from the initial ceria by a dilatation of the whole structure and, for deeply reduced samples, the hexagonal C e , O , phase."
[5] "Complete reoxidation by oxygen occurs at room temperature, for all reduction percentages below ca. 60/,,,i.e. as long as the reduced phase remained in the cubic form."
[6] "The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective of the initial surface."
[7] "The structure of ceria is face-centred cubic (fluorite type)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity, allowing for faster oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This mechanism enables the efficient transfer of oxygen atoms between reactants and products, driving the oxidation reactions forward.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧空位形成而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明更高的反应性，允许更快地形成氧空位，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这种机制使氧原子在反应物和产物之间高效转移，推动氧化反应向前发展。
