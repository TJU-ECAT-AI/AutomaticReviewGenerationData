[1] "Several studies have appeared which have focussed on elucidating the conditions of these redox processes in order to obtain a better understanding of their mechanisms."
[2] "The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective of the initial surface."
[3] "With the low-surface-area ceria, a small reduction plateau at 620 K attributed to the reduction of the ceri$i surface was observed as well as an intermediate state at a higher temperature of reduction (900 K), having the formal composition CeO, 8 3 ,  r.e. close to that of Ce,O, ,."
[4] "In the case of the 11 5 m2 g-' sample. the observation of a plateau corresponding to the reduction of the surface depended on the operating conditions, but again a stabilized composition close to CeO, g4 could be obtained at 670 K."
[5] "The reoxidation by tixygen of the reduced oxides was almost complete at room temperature."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which leads to the adsorption and oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher reactivity of the oxide surface, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing power. The specific conditions under which these processes occur, including temperature, surface area, and the presence of other reactants, influence the efficiency of the mechanism.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位来运行，这导致了反应物的吸附和氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常表示氧化物表面的更高反应性，因为它更容易促进氧空位的形成，从而增强催化活性和氧化能力。这些过程的具体条件，包括温度、表面积和其他反应物的存在，影响机制的效率。
