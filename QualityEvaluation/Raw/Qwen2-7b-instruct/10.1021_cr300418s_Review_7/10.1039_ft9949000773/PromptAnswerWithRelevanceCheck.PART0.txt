[1] "Several studies have appeared which have focussed on elucidating the conditions of these redox processes in order to obtain a better understanding of their mechanisms."
[2] "The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective of the initial surface."
[3] "With the low-surface-area ceria, a small reduction plateau at 620 K attributed to the reduction of the ceri$i surface was observed as well as an intermediate state at a higher temperature of reduction (900 K), having the formal composition CeO, 8 3 ,  r.e. close to that of Ce,O, ,."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which leads to the adsorption and oxidation of reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher reactivity of the oxide surface, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing power. The specific conditions under which these processes occur, including temperature, surface area, and the presence of other reactants, influence the efficiency of the mechanism.

[2] "The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective of the initial surface area."
[3] "A similar relationship between the BET surface area and the extent of reduction was established using the area of the low-temperature TPR composite peak, the maximum of which was found to be constant at 810 K."
[4] "Complete reoxidation by oxygen occurs at room temperature, for all reduction percentages below ca. 60/,,i.e. as long as the reduced phase remained in the cubic form."
[5] "The first peak results from several steps, it can be related to a global process corresponding to the consumption of the surface oxygen species as evidenced before."
[6] "Assuming that the first peak is due only to the reduction of the various surface oxygen species, it is interesting to note that no major shift is observed at the maximum temperature of this peak."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption of reactants, the subsequent oxidation, and the release of products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the reaction efficiency and the rate of product formation. Consequently, the value of ΔEv is significant in evaluating the catalytic performance and oxidative capacity of oxide surfaces in such reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through successive reduction steps of ceria particles by hydrogen between 300 and 1070 K, which are followed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and in situ magnetic measurements. These processes are carried out on various samples with differing BET surface areas. The phases present in ceria reduced between 670 and 1270 K are determined by X-ray analysis. Complete reoxidation by oxygen takes place at room temperature for all reduction percentages below approximately 60%, provided the reduced phase remains in the cubic form. The structure of ceria is face-centered cubic (fluorite type), described as a stack of oxygen ions connected by edges, with the cerium atom at the center of the oxygen cube in octahedral coordination.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies are energetically favorable states that require energy (ΔEv) for their creation. The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies a more stable and less reactive surface, which can lead to decreased catalytic activity but enhanced stability. Conversely, a higher ΔEv might indicate a more reactive surface, potentially increasing the catalytic efficiency but possibly compromising stability. Thus, controlling ΔEv through material synthesis or processing can fine-tune the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.
