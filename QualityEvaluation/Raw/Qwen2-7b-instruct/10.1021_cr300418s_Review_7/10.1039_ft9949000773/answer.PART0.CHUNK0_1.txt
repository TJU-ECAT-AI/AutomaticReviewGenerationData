[1] "Several studies have appeared which have focussed on elucidating the conditions of these redox processes in order to obtain a better understanding of their mechanisms."
[2] "The reduction began at 470 K, irrespective of the initial surface area."
[3] "A similar relationship between the BET surface area and the extent of reduction was established using the area of the low-temperature TPR composite peak, the maximum of which was found to be constant at 810 K."
[4] "Complete reoxidation by oxygen occurs at room temperature, for all reduction percentages below ca. 60/,,i.e. as long as the reduced phase remained in the cubic form."
[5] "The first peak results from several steps, it can be related to a global process corresponding to the consumption of the surface oxygen species as evidenced before."
[6] "Assuming that the first peak is due only to the reduction of the various surface oxygen species, it is interesting to note that no major shift is observed at the maximum temperature of this peak."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These oxygen vacancies facilitate the adsorption of reactants, the subsequent oxidation, and the release of products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the reaction efficiency and the rate of product formation. Consequently, the value of ΔEv is significant in evaluating the catalytic performance and oxidative capacity of oxide surfaces in such reactions.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧化物表面的氧空位而运作。这些氧空位促进了反应物的吸附、随后的氧化和产物的释放。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常表明氧空位更易于形成，从而提高反应效率和产物形成速率。因此，ΔEv值对于评估氧化物表面在这些反应中的催化性能和氧化能力具有重要意义。
