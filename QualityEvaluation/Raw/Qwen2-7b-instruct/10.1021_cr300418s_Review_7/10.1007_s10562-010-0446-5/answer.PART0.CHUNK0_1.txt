[1] "The present paper reports results of systematic density functional studies on the formation of CO2 through direct combination of CO and lattice oxygen on the clean and doped ceria."
[2] "Interestingly, we found a bent CO2,ad structure as the transition state for the reaction: CO + oxide  CO2,gas + deficient oxide, on the clean ceria (111) surface."
[3] "Zr-dopants further weaken the CeO bonds in the substrate and therefore facilitate direct formation of CO + OL  CO2,gas."
[4] "Unlike the clean CeO2 (111) surface, Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) efficiently attract CO molecules from the gas phase, as suggested by the sizable adsorption energy of 18.5 kcal/mol."
[5] "The calculated Evac values are 2.30 and 0.94 eV for CeO2  x (110) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2  x (110), respectively."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the surface of redox oxides. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values, such as in Zr-doped ceria, facilitate the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3, weakening the CeO bonds and enabling the direct formation and release of CO2. This mechanism explains experimental observations and provides insights for manipulating the composition and structure of nanocatalysts involving oxides.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过直接将CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子结合来操作。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv值，如在锆掺杂的氧化铈中，能够促进Ce+4向Ce+3的还原，削弱CeO键，从而允许直接形成和释放CO2。这一机制解释了实验观察，并为涉及氧化物的纳米催化剂的组成和结构进行合理调整提供了见解。
