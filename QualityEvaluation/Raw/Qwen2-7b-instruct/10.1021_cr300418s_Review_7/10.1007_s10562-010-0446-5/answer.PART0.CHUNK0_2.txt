[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2 and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies."
[2] "This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[3] "It is intriguing that CO directly forms CO2 with the lattice O on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) and desorbs easily afterward from the deficient substrate."
[4] "Since the binding energies of CO are rather high on the clean and Zr-doped CeO2 (110), the reaction can be easily poisoned and the (110) surfaces remain inactive."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the surface of oxides. This process leads to the formation of CO2 with minimal activation energy. The presence of Zr dopants facilitates this mechanism by reducing the size of Zr4+ ions, which relieves stress for the creation of Ce3+ ions. This reduction in energy and enhancement of oxygen mobility on Zr-doped ceria surfaces helps in the direct oxidation of CO, lowering the energy cost for the formation and release of CO2. However, on the (110) surfaces, the high binding energies of CO prevent easy oxidation, making these surfaces less active for direct CO oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it affects the ease with which oxygen can move and participate in reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过使CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合来运作。这一过程导致CO2的形成，且具有较小的活化能。Zr掺杂的存在通过减小Zr4+离子的尺寸，从而缓解了对Ce3+离子的应力，降低了能量并增强了氧在掺杂Zr的氧化锆表面的流动性。这有助于直接氧化CO，降低CO2的形成和释放的能量成本。然而，在(110)表面上，CO较强的结合能阻止了容易氧化，使得这些表面对于直接CO氧化活性较低。对于氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，氧气空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）起着重要作用，因为它影响了氧参与反应的能力。
