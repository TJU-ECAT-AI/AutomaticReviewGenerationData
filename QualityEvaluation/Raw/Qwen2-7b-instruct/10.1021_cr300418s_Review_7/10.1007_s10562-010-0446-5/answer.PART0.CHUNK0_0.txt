[1] "Unlike traditional density functional calculations, we explored metastable geometries, in particular, those with the CO2,ad groups. It is intriguing that CO directly forms CO2 with the lattice O on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) and desorbs easily afterward from the deficient substrate."
[2] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[3] "Since the binding energies of CO are rather high on the clean and Zr-doped CeO2 (110), the reaction can be easily poisoned and the (110) surfaces remain inactive."
[4] "Our findings satisfactorily explain experimental observations [5] and give indispensable insights for rational manipulations of composition and structure of nanocatalysts that involve oxides."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by having CO directly combine with lattice oxygen atoms on ceria surfaces, forming CO2. This process is followed by the easy desorption of CO2 from the substrate, leaving a lattice deficiency behind. This mechanism is significant because it describes the primary pathway for CO oxidation on redox oxides, providing insights into the catalytic activity of these surfaces.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, which facilitates the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3. This weakening of the CeO bonds benefits the direct formation and release of CO2, enhancing the surface's activity in CO oxidation reactions.

3. The catalytic process on the CeO2 (110) surface remains inactive due to the high binding energies of CO, which makes the surface susceptible to poisoning. This highlights the importance of surface orientation and oxygen mobility in influencing the efficiency of CO oxidation.

4. The findings presented here successfully explain observed experimental data and offer valuable insights for the rational design of nanocatalysts involving oxides. These insights can guide the manipulation of composition and structure to enhance the catalytic properties of these materials.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过使CO直接与氧化铈表面的晶格氧原子结合形成CO2来运作。之后，CO2从缺陷的基质中容易脱附，留下一个晶格缺陷。这一机制在描述红氧化物表面CO氧化的重要路径的同时，提供了理解这些表面催化活性的见解。

2. 形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这促进了Ce+4到Ce+3的还原。这削弱了CeO键，有利于直接形成和释放CO2，从而增强表面在CO氧化反应中的活性。

3. CeO2 (110)表面的催化过程保持无活性，原因是CO的结合能较高，使表面容易中毒。这突出了表面取向和氧流动性的关键作用，影响CO氧化的效率。

4. 这里提出的发现成功地解释了观察到的实验数据，并提供了有价值的见解，用于指导氧化物基纳米催化剂组成的合理设计。这些见解可以指导材料结构的调整以增强其催化性质。
