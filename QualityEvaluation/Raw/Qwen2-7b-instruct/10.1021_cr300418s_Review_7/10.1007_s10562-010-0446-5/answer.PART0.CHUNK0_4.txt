[1] "Unlike traditional density functional calculations, we explored metastable geometries, in particular, those with the CO2,ad groups. It is intriguing that CO directly forms CO2 with the lattice O on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) and desorbs easily afterward from the deficient substrate."
[2] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[3] "Since the binding energies of CO are rather high on the clean and Zr-doped CeO2 (110), the reaction can be easily poisoned and the (110) surfaces remain inactive."
[4] "Our findings satisfactorily explain experimental observations [5] and give indispensable insights for rational manipulations of composition and structure of nanocatalysts that involve oxides."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen on the surface of ceria to form CO2, followed by easy desorption from the deficient substrate. This process is facilitated by the presence of Zr dopants, which reduce the energy required for the creation of Ce3+ ions and increase the mobility of oxygen atoms.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Smaller ΔEv indicates a more favorable environment for oxygen vacancy formation, leading to enhanced activity and oxidizing ability due to increased oxygen mobility and easier reduction of Ce4+ ions to Ce3+.

3. The high binding energies of CO on the (110) surfaces prevent effective oxidation, making these surfaces less active for the direct oxidation of CO. This can lead to poisoning of the catalyst, keeping the (110) surfaces inactive.

4. The study's findings align with experimental observations, providing insights into the manipulation of oxide catalysts' composition and structure for improved catalytic properties, particularly in CO oxidation reactions.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO直接与氧化铈表面的晶格氧结合形成CO2，随后从缺氧基质上容易脱附。这一过程在掺杂有Zr的材料中被促进，这归因于Zr4+离子比Ce4+离子更小，释放应力以产生Ce3+离子；以及Zr掺杂氧化铈中的氧原子移动性更高，相比纯氧化铈而言。

2. 形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较小的ΔEv表明更有利于氧空位的形成，导致增强的活性和氧化能力，因为增加了氧的流动性并更容易将Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+。

3. CO在(110)表面上的高结合能阻止了有效的氧化，使得这些表面对于直接氧化CO活性较低。这可能导致催化剂中毒，使(110)表面保持不活跃。

4. 研究结果与实验观察一致，提供了优化氧化物催化剂组成和结构以提高催化性能的见解，特别是对于CO氧化反应。
