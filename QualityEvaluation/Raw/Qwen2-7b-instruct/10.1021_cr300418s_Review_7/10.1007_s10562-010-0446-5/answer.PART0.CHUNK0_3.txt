[1] "Unlike traditional density functional calculations, we explored metastable geometries, in particular, those with the CO2,ad groups."
[2] "It is intriguing that CO directly forms CO2 with the lattice O on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) and desorbs easily afterward from the deficient substrate."
[3] "This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[4] "Since the binding energies of CO are rather high on the clean and Zr-doped CeO2 (110), the reaction can be easily poisoned and the (110) surfaces remain inactive."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen on the surface of redox oxides. This process facilitates the oxidation of CO by forming CO2, which then easily desorbs from the deficient substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Smaller ΔEv indicates higher mobility of oxygen atoms, which enhances the catalytic activity of the oxide surface.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及在红氧化物表面的CO与晶格氧的直接结合，这促进了CO的氧化形成CO2，然后从缺陷基底容易脱附。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较小的ΔEv表明氧原子的更高移动性，从而增强了氧化物表面的催化活性。
