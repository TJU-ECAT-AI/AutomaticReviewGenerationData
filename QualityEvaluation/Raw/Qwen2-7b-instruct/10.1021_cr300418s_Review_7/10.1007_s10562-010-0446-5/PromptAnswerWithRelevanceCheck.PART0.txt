[1] "Unlike traditional density functional calculations, we explored metastable geometries, in particular, those with the CO2,ad groups. It is intriguing that CO directly forms CO2 with the lattice O on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) and desorbs easily afterward from the deficient substrate."
[2] "Zr dopant can facilitate the CO oxidation process. This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."
[3] "Since the binding energies of CO are rather high on the clean and Zr-doped CeO2 (110), the reaction can be easily poisoned and the (110) surfaces remain inactive."
[4] "Our findings satisfactorily explain experimental observations [5] and give indispensable insights for rational manipulations of composition and structure of nanocatalysts that involve oxides."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by having CO directly combine with lattice oxygen atoms on ceria surfaces, forming CO2. This process is followed by the easy desorption of CO2 from the substrate, leaving a lattice deficiency behind. This mechanism is significant because it describes the primary pathway for CO oxidation on redox oxides, providing insights into the catalytic activity of these surfaces.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, which facilitates the reduction of Ce+4 to Ce+3. This weakening of the CeO bonds benefits the direct formation and release of CO2, enhancing the surface's activity in CO oxidation reactions.

3. The catalytic process on the CeO2 (110) surface remains inactive due to the high binding energies of CO, which makes the surface susceptible to poisoning. This highlights the importance of surface orientation and oxygen mobility in influencing the efficiency of CO oxidation.

4. The findings presented here successfully explain observed experimental data and offer valuable insights for the rational design of nanocatalysts involving oxides. These insights can guide the manipulation of composition and structure to enhance the catalytic properties of these materials.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过使CO直接与氧化铈表面的晶格氧原子结合形成CO2来运作。之后，CO2从缺陷的基质中容易脱附，留下一个晶格缺陷。这一机制在描述红氧化物表面CO氧化的重要路径的同时，提供了理解这些表面催化活性的见解。

2. 形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这促进了Ce+4到Ce+3的还原。这削弱了CeO键，有利于直接形成和释放CO2，从而增强表面在CO氧化反应中的活性。

3. CeO2 (110)表面的催化过程保持无活性，原因是CO的结合能较高，使表面容易中毒。这突出了表面取向和氧流动性的关键作用，影响CO氧化的效率。

4. 这里提出的发现成功地解释了观察到的实验数据，并提供了有价值的见解，用于指导氧化物基纳米催化剂组成的合理设计。这些见解可以指导材料结构的调整以增强其催化性质。

[1] "One major findings is that CO easily grasps one lattice oxygen atom to form CO2 and CO2 on CeO2 (111) and Ce0.75Zr0.25O2 (111) with small activation energies."
[2] "This can be attributed to several factors: (1) the smaller size of Zr4+ than Ce4+, which releases stress for the creation of Ce3+; (2) the smaller reduction energy [4, 29]; and (3) the higher oxygen mobility of the Zr-doped ceria as compared with the pure ceria [30]."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the direct combination of CO with lattice oxygen atoms on the surface of oxides. This process leads to the formation of CO2 with minimal activation energy. The presence of Zr dopants facilitates this mechanism by reducing the size of Zr4+ ions, which relieves stress for the creation of Ce3+ ions. This reduction in energy and enhancement of oxygen mobility on Zr-doped ceria surfaces helps in the direct oxidation of CO, lowering the energy cost for the formation and release of CO2. However, on the (110) surfaces, the high binding energies of CO prevent easy oxidation, making these surfaces less active for direct CO oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it affects the ease with which oxygen can move and participate in reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过使CO与氧化物表面的晶格氧原子直接结合来运作。这一过程导致CO2的形成，且具有较小的活化能。Zr掺杂的存在通过减小Zr4+离子的尺寸，从而缓解了对Ce3+离子的应力，降低了能量并增强了氧在掺杂Zr的氧化锆表面的流动性。这有助于直接氧化CO，降低CO2的形成和释放的能量成本。然而，在(110)表面上，CO较强的结合能阻止了容易氧化，使得这些表面对于直接CO氧化活性较低。对于氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，氧气空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）起着重要作用，因为它影响了氧参与反应的能力。

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及CO直接与氧化铈表面的晶格氧结合形成CO2，随后从缺氧基质上容易脱附。这一过程在掺杂有Zr的材料中被促进，这归因于Zr4+离子比Ce4+离子更小，释放应力以产生Ce3+离子；以及Zr掺杂氧化铈中的氧原子移动性更高，相比纯氧化铈而言。

2. 形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较小的ΔEv表明更有利于氧空位的形成，导致增强的活性和氧化能力，因为增加了氧的流动性并更容易将Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+。

3. CO在(110)表面上的高结合能阻止了有效的氧化，使得这些表面对于直接氧化CO活性较低。这可能导致催化剂中毒，使(110)表面保持不活跃。

4. 研究结果与实验观察一致，提供了优化氧化物催化剂组成和结构以提高催化性能的见解，特别是对于CO氧化反应。
