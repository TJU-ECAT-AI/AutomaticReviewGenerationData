[1] "Au+ ions are produced in a laser ablation source, which is described in detail elsewhere."
[2] "Following each experiment, the average cluster height was calculated and plotted in Figure 2."
[3] "We now apply that idea to the single atom case on the surface of titania and find that, at a critical threshold energy, sintering can be prevented, resulting in the formation of pinned Au atoms on the surface."
[4] "Our results are not consistent with O-atom vacancies as the primary binding site since >80% of the Au atoms are located along 5c-Ti rows, and we deposit fewer Au atoms than there are vacancies."
[5] "The above-presented data suggests the following pinning mechanism: Upon impact, a localized, high-temperature region is created as the atom hits the surface, as evidenced by the observed sintering at low coverages at a deposition energy of 100 eV."
[6] "The features we observe following high-energy impact (>20 eV) are atomic in size and appear along the titanium rows, suggesting that Au atoms either selectively bind above the 5-c Ti atoms, or perhaps substitute for Ti atoms in the lattice."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv allows for easier formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This is because the presence of oxygen vacancies creates additional active sites on the oxide surface, which facilitates the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of reactants.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv使得氧空位更容易形成，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为氧空位的存在在氧化物表面上创建了额外的活性位点，这有助于吸附和随后氧化反应物。
