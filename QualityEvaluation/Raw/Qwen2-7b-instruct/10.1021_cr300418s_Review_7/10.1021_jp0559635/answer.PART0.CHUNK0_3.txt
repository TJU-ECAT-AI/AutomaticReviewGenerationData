[1] "In bulk form, gold is regarded as chemically inert."
[2] "Recently, mononuclear supported gold(III) and gold(I) centers formed from ionic complexes have been shown to catalyze CO oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction under ambient reaction conditions."
[3] "It has been known for sometime that it is possible to produce epitaxial thin films of metal on an oxide surface via energetic cluster impact."
[4] "We now apply that idea to the single atom case on the surface of titania and find that, at a critical threshold energy, sintering can be prevented, resulting in the formation of pinned Au atoms on the surface."
[5] "Upon impact, a localized, high-temperature region is created as the atom hits the surface, as evidenced by the observed sintering at low coverages at a deposition energy of 100 eV."
[6] "Despite the fact that these studies involved large metallic clusters and metallic substrates, this impact threshold agrees qualitatively with our pinning energy of 20 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an oxygen atom is removed from the surface, an O vacancy is created, which then allows for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, facilitating the subsequent oxidation of reactants. The energy barrier (ΔEv) for the formation of an O vacancy affects the rate at which these vacancies are created and subsequently influences the reaction kinetics and efficiency. Lower ΔEv values allow for easier formation of O vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the creation of oxygen vacancies (OVs) through the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface. The energy required for this process (ΔEv) determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate the formation of OVs, thereby increasing the surface's reactivity and effectiveness in catalyzing oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式涉及在氧化物表面形成氧空位（OV）。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当氧原子从表面移除时，会在表面形成一个氧空位，随后可以吸附氧气分子，促进反应物的氧化。ΔEv的大小影响着空位的形成速率，进而影响反应的动力学和效率。较低的ΔEv值使得更容易形成氧空位，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
