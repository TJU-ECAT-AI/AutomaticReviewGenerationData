[1] "Au+ ions are produced in a laser ablation source, which is described in detail elsewhere."
[2] "Prior to cluster deposition, the titania samples (Commercial Crystal Laboratories) were cleaned in UHV with cycles of argon ion bombardment (0.51 keV) and annealing to 1000 K for 15 s intervals."
[3] "STM images show only atomic features 1.4 Å high and 4 Å wide, which are also located mainly (>80% of observed features) over the 5-c Ti rows."
[4] "The features we observe following high-energy impact (>20 eV) are atomic in size and appear along the titanium rows, suggesting that Au atoms either selectively bind above the 5-c Ti atoms, or perhaps substitute for Ti atoms in the lattice."
[5] "The above-presented data suggests the following pinning mechanism: Upon impact, a localized, high-temperature region is created as the atom hits the surface, as evidenced by the observed sintering at low coverages at a deposition energy of 100 eV."
[6] "Exploring these monatomic Au centers for possible catalytic activity is currently underway."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to drive the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv leads to more efficient activation of the reactants and thus increases the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位（ΔEv）的形成释放的能量来驱动反应。氧空位形成的能量要求对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。更高的ΔEv导致更有效的激活反应物，从而提高氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
