[1] "Recently, mononuclear supported gold(III) and gold(I) centers formed from ionic complexes have been shown to catalyze CO oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction under ambient reaction conditions."
[2] "Size-selected studies have also been performed on supported small gold clusters in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions (model catalysts), revealing that deposited Au1 exhibits nearly zero catalytic activity, while Au clusters seven or eight atoms in size are quite active."
[3] "These observations suggest a mechanism in which high-energy collision leads to the annealing of any impact-created surface damage and the pinning of Au atoms to the surface."
[4] "The above-presented data suggests the following pinning mechanism: Upon impact, a localized, high-temperature region is created as the atom hits the surface, as evidenced by the observed sintering at low coverages at a deposition energy of 100 eV."

In the context of oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the adsorption of oxygen molecules on the oxide surface, followed by the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for this process, ΔEv, plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the easy formation of oxygen vacancies, which can then act as active sites for the oxidation reactions. This leads to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, if ΔEv is high, the formation of oxygen vacancies becomes less favorable, potentially reducing the efficiency of the catalytic process.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧分子在氧化物表面的吸附，随后形成氧空位（ΔEv）。形成氧空位所需的能量ΔEv决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当ΔEv较低时，更容易形成氧空位，这可以作为氧化反应的活性位点，从而提高催化活性和氧化能力。相反，如果ΔEv较高，则形成氧空位的可能性降低，可能降低催化过程的效率。
