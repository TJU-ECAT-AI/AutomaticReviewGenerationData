[1] "In bulk form, gold is regarded as chemically inert."
[2] "Recently, mononuclear supported gold(III) and gold(I) centers formed from ionic complexes have been shown to catalyze CO oxidation and the water-gas shift reaction under ambient reaction conditions."
[3] "Size-selected studies have also been performed on supported small gold clusters in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions (model catalysts), revealing that deposited Au1 exhibits nearly zero catalytic activity, while Au clusters seven or eight atoms in size are quite active."
[4] "Au+ ions are produced in a laser ablation source, which is described in detail elsewhere."
[5] "Prior to cluster deposition, the titania samples (Commercial Crystal Laboratories) were cleaned in UHV with cycles of argon ion bombardment (0.51 keV) and annealing to 1000 K for 15 s intervals."
[6] "After cluster deposition, the sample was translated under vacuum into a separate chamber, in which the base pressure was < 3 × 10-10 Torr, and imaged using STM."
[7] "The features we observe following high-energy impact (>20 eV) are atomic in size and appear along the titanium rows, suggesting that Au atoms either selectively bind above the 5-c Ti atoms, or perhaps substitute for Ti atoms in the lattice."
[8] "It is possible that the impinging monomers lack the momentum necessary to create widespread, permanent surface damage."
[9] "In an attempt to better understand the pinning mechanism, we studied the effect of exposing the titania sample to higher coverages of Au with 100 eV kinetic energy."
[10] "The above-presented data suggests the following pinning mechanism: Upon impact, a localized, high-temperature region is created as the atom hits the surface, as evidenced by the observed sintering at low coverages at a deposition energy of 100 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and subsequent reduction of oxygen vacancies (OVs) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv allows for easier formation of OVs, enhancing the reaction rate and increasing the oxidizing ability of the surface. Conversely, a higher ΔEv results in reduced catalytic activity due to the difficulty in creating OVs, thereby decreasing the reaction rate and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面上形成并随后还原氧空位（OV）来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。较低的ΔEv允许更轻松地形成OV，从而提高反应速率并增加表面的氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv导致催化活性降低，因为难以创建OV，从而降低氧化物表面的反应速率和氧化能力。
