[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These oxygen vacancies act as reactive sites where the reaction takes place."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates higher reactivity and thus higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst, acting as reactive sites for the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is critical in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv signifies higher reactivity, leading to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing capability.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中，通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来发挥作用。这些氧空位作为反应发生的活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明更高的反应性，从而导致增强的催化活性和氧化能力。
