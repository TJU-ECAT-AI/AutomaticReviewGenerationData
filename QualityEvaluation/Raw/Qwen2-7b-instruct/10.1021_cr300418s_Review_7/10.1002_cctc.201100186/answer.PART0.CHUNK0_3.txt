[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving oxygen adsorption, activation, and subsequent oxidation of the substrate."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
