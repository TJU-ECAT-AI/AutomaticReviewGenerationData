[1] "The purpose of the data analysis was to reveal empirical evidence on the catalytic performance on catalyst composition and interactive properties among the single components of the analyzed variables and relationships between them."
[2] "In particular, the analyses revealed evidence of the following results: the presence of certain elements and their combinations significantly increases S(C2) and/or Y(C2) as identified by their variance (ANOVA); the extent to which the proportions of certain elements correlate with S(C2) or Y(C2), and whether this correlation is positive or negative (correlation analysis); the combinations of the presence or absence of elements show the highest influence on changes in the average S(C2) or Y(C2); for certain elements, the combinations of their proportions also show such influence (decision trees)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (O-vacancies) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the surface.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism utilizes oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. A lower energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位（O-空位）来操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
