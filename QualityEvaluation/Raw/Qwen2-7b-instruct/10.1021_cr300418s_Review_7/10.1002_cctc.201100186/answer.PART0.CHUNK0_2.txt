[1] "In particular, at temperatures from 950 to 1200K typical of the OCM reaction, homogeneous processes mainly control the coupling reaction."
[2] "The radicals should recombine selectively to ethane, which is then dehydrogenated to ethylene oxidatively or possibly also thermally."
[3] "Therefore, a high-performance OCM catalyst should not only initiate the formation of CH3 radicals at lower temperatures but also suppress nonselective surface oxidation of methane and hydrocarbon products to carbon dioxide."
[4] "All oxides of the selected elements, which positively affect the selectivity to C2 products, show strong basicity."
[5] "The maximal C2 selectivities for the proposed catalyst compositions range from 72 to 82%, and the respective C2 yields range from 16 to 26%."
[6] "The assumption had to be made that the published data used for the statistical analysis are reproducible within the frame of experimental accuracy."

1. The OCM reaction typically occurs at temperatures ranging from 950 to 1200K, where homogeneous processes predominantly govern the coupling reaction.
2. The radicals generated in the reaction should selectively combine to form ethane, which is subsequently dehydrogenated to ethylene through oxidation or potentially thermal processes.
3. For a high-performance OCM catalyst, it is crucial to initiate the formation of CH3 radicals at lower temperatures while simultaneously inhibiting the nonselective oxidation of methane and hydrocarbon products to carbon dioxide.
4. The oxides of the selected elements, which enhance the selectivity towards C2 products, exhibit strong basicity.
5. The maximum C2 selectivities achievable with the proposed catalyst compositions fall within the range of 72 to 82%, with corresponding C2 yields spanning from 16 to 26%.
6. It was necessary to assume that the data published for the statistical analysis are reproducible within the limits of experimental accuracy.

1. OCM反应通常发生在950至1200K的温度范围内，其中同质过程主要控制耦合反应。
2. 生成的自由基应选择性地结合形成乙烷，然后通过氧化或可能的热过程脱氢为乙烯。
3. 对于高效率的OCM催化剂，不仅需要在较低温度下启动CH3自由基的形成，而且还需要抑制甲烷和烃类产物到二氧化碳的非选择性表面氧化。
4. 提升C2产品选择性的选定元素的氧化物表现出强烈的碱性。
5. 提议的催化剂组成可实现的最高C2选择性范围为72至82%，相应的C2产率范围为16至26%。
6. 必须假设用于统计分析的数据在实验精度内是可重复的。
