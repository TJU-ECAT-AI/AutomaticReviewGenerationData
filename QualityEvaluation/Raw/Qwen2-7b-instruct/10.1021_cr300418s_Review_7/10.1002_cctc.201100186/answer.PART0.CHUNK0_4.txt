The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of surface oxygen vacancies. These vacancies serve as active sites for the adsorption of reactant molecules, such as hydrocarbons, leading to the formation of oxidized products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, which in turn suggests higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to the increased availability of active sites.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the creation of surface oxygen vacancies acting as active sites for reactant adsorption, facilitating the production of oxidized products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. A reduced ΔEv suggests easier oxygen vacancy formation, correlating with higher catalytic efficiency and oxidizing capacity due to enhanced active site availability.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位的形成而运作。这些空位作为吸附反应物分子（如烃类）的活性位点，导致氧化产物的形成。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有重要影响。较低的ΔEv意味着更易于形成氧空位，从而暗示更高的催化效率和氧化能力，因为活性位点的可用性增强。
