[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially. It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[2] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
[3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancy formation requires a specific energy, denoted as ΔEv. This energy is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power, facilitating more efficient and rapid oxidation reactions. This mechanism is pivotal in heterogeneous catalysis, particularly in industrial processes where selective oxidation is desired.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位进行操作。氧空位的形成需要特定的能量，表示为ΔEv。这一能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和氧化能力，从而促进更高效和快速的氧化反应。这种机制在异相催化中尤为重要，尤其是在希望实现选择性氧化的工业过程中。
