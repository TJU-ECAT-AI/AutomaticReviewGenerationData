[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
[2] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
[3] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
[4] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
[5] "In view of this situation, we felt there was a need for a collection of monographs, each one of which would deal at an advanced level with a selected topic, so as to build a catalysis"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. This vacancy allows for the adsorption of oxygen atoms and facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher reactivity and a stronger oxidizing ability, as it enables more efficient adsorption and reaction of oxygen atoms, leading to faster and more effective oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）而运作。这种空位允许氧原子的吸附，并促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的反应性和更强的氧化能力，因为它能够更有效地吸附和反应氧原子，从而实现更快、更有效的氧化反应。
