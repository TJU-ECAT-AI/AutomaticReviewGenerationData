[1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
[2] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
[3] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
[4] "As recently as sixty years ago, Rideal and Taylor could still treat the subject comprehensively in a single volume, but by the 1950s, Emmett required six volumes, and no conventional multivolume text could now cover the whole of catalysis in any depth."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen vacancies are formed on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to lower reactivity, while lower ΔEv allows for more efficient adsorption and reaction of oxygen molecules, enhancing the catalytic performance. This mechanism enables the oxide catalyst to facilitate the oxidation process by providing active sites for the reaction to occur.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤进行操作，其中在氧化物催化剂表面上形成氧空位。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要作用。较高的ΔEv通常导致较低的反应性，而较低的ΔEv允许更有效地吸附和反应氧气分子，从而增强催化性能。这一机制使氧化物催化剂能够通过提供反应发生所需的活性位点来促进氧化过程。
