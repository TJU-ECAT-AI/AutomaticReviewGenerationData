[1] "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a reducible transition metal oxide that is widely used in a number of technological fields such as photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, solar cells, hydrophilic films, gas sensors, waste remediation, and biocompatible materials [18]."
[2] "Among these applications particularly in areas such as photocatalysis, photodegradation of organic pollutants and the photo-generation of hydrophilic films, the interaction of O2 with TiO2 plays an important role [1,3,5,7,8]."
[3] "For example, O2 is a common oxidant and is also used in photocatalysis as a scavenger of the photo-excited electrons to prevent negative charge accumulation on the surface of the catalysts [13]."
[4] "To enhance the efficiencies of the applications listed above, it is essential to improve our understanding of how O2 interacts with TiO2 surfaces."
[5] "In early surface science studies under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, the interaction of molecular O2 with TiO2 single crystals was studied most frequently using photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) [822]."
[6] "Very valuable information has been gained by using these desorption techniques on the O2 interaction with rutile TiO2(110)."
[7] "For example, O2-PSD studies by the Yates group [810,16,17] have revealed that the O2-PSD occurs in UHV on O2-exposed TiO2(110) very much as it is observed on high-surface-area TiO2 powder materials [2830]."
[8] "These studies disclosed the complex nature of the O2TiO2(110) interaction and showed that dissociative and molecular channels co-exist on reduced TiO2(110) crystals."
[9] "The desorption of O2 at 410 K was observed for TiO2(110) (1×1) samples characterized by 8%ML (monolayer) bridging oxygen (Obr) vacancies after O2 adsorption at temperatures lower than 180 K [1214,16]."
[10] "Interestingly, no sign of scrambling was found for the O2 molecules that desorb in the TPD peak centered at 410 K neither with the Obr atoms on the surface nor with other O2 molecules [12,15]."
[11] "EELS measurements indicated that charge is transferred from the TiO2(110) surface to O2 molecules adsorbed at 120 K and suggested the stabilization of a superoxo species (singly charged O2) on the surface [1214]."
[12] "Recent low-temperature TPD studies by Dohnlek et al. [18] and Kimmel and Petrik [20] showed that physisorbed O2 desorbs from the TiO2(110) surface at temperatures below 100 K."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from an oxide surface to an organic substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen vacancies to form, which can increase the surface's ability to promote oxidation reactions. This is because the presence of oxygen vacancies can create additional active sites for the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of substrates, thereby enhancing the catalytic efficiency of the oxide surface. The ability of the surface to generate and maintain these active sites is crucial for effective catalysis in oxidative processes, especially in scenarios involving the conversion of organic compounds to more oxidized forms.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面向有机基质转移氧气来起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。ΔEv值越低，表示氧化物表面更容易形成氧空位，这可以增加其促进氧化反应的能力。这是因为氧空位的存在可以创建额外的活性位点，用于吸附并随后氧化基质，从而增强氧化物表面的催化效率。表面能够产生并保持这些活性位点的能力对于有效催化氧化过程至关重要，尤其是在将有机化合物转化为更氧化形式的情况下。

[5] "The technique of choice to study the dissociative adsorption of O2 on reduced TiO2(110) is STM. Previous STM studies have unraveled a surprisingly rich and complex interaction of O2 with the reduced TiO2 (110) surface [4,6,2527,3142]."

[6] "The exact nature of the charge donors on the surface of reduced TiO2(110) crystals is still an issue of ongoing research [33,44,4656]."

[7] "The presented TPD and STM data addressing the O2 interaction with low- and medium-reduced TiO2(110)(1×1) crystals are consistent with our previous combined high-resolution STM, photo- electron spectroscopy and DFT study where we proposed that Ti interstitials in the near-surface region are largely responsible for the defect state in the band gap and that these donor specific sites enable the adsorption of electronegative adsorbates such as O2 molecules and Oot adatoms on the surface [32]."

[8] "In agreement with EELS data by Henderson et al. [12] we anticipate that the more Oot adatoms and O2 molecules can be chemisorbed on the TiO2(110) surface the more defect charge is available in the near-surface region,i.e. the larger the Ti3d defect state is."

[9] "Based on the STM data obtained after O2 exposure at LT we can conclude with certainty that the electronic charge stems predominantly from the near-surface region."

[1] "In the present article we report on systematic and detailed STM studies on the prevailing O2 dissociation channel on reduced TiO2 (110)(1×1) as a function of the adsorption temperature. The STM studies reveal that the second O2 dissociation channel is an activated process requiring temperatures higher than 150 K180 K and that the O2 dissociation reaction on reduced TiO2(110) is self-limiting. The STM results are supported by TPD data that allow us to directly compare the here presented new results with previously published spectroscopic data. The results are explained by invoking a competition between dissociative and molecular O2 interaction channels for the electronic charge in the near-surface region, and a new model for the interaction of molecular O2 with reduced TiO2(110) crystals is proposed."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy from the adsorbed oxygen (O2) to drive the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv generally leads to more efficient oxygen adsorption and activation, enhancing the catalytic performance and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

2. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is a key parameter that influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the ΔEv affects the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecules, which in turn impacts the efficiency of the oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen adsorption and activation, thereby boosting the catalytic activity and oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface.
