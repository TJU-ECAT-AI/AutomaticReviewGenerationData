[1] "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a reducible transition metal oxide that is widely used in a number of technological fields such as photocatalysis,heterogeneous catalysis, solar cells, hydrophilic films, gas sensors,waste remediation, and biocompatible materials [18]."
[2] "Among these applications particularly in areas such as photocatalysis, photode- gradation of organic pollutants and the photo-generation of hydro- philic films, the interaction of O2 with TiO2 plays an important role [1,3,5,7,8]."
[3] "In early surface science studies under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, the interaction of molecular O2 with TiO2 single crystals was studied most frequently using photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) [822]."
[4] "Very valuable information has been gained by using these desorption techniques on the O2 interaction with rutile TiO2(110)."
[5] "In addition, the thermal chemistry has been examined by combining detailed TPD studies with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements [1214]."
[6] "These studies disclosed the complex nature of the O2TiO2(110) interaction and showed that dissociative and molecular channels co-exist on reduced TiO2(110) crystals."
[7] "The desorption of O2 at 410 K was observed for TiO2(110) (1×1) samples characterized by 8%ML (monolayer) bridging oxygen (Obr) vacancies after O2 adsorption at temperatures lower than 180 K [1214,16]."
[8] "Interestingly, no sign of scrambling was found for the O2 molecules that desorb in the TPD peak centered at 410 K neither with the Obr atoms on the surface nor with other O2 molecules [12,15]."
[9] "Recent low-temperature TPD studies by Dohnlek et al. [18] and Kimmel and Petrik [20] showed that physisorbed O2 desorbs from the TiO2(110) surface at temperatures below 100 K."
[10] "By means of TPD, it is rather difficult to gather information about O2 dissociation on the reduced TiO2(110) surface."
[11] "The technique of choice to study the dissociative adsorption of O2 on reduced TiO2(110) is STM. Previous STM studies have unraveled a surprisingly rich and complex interaction of O2 with the reduced TiO2 (110) surface [4,6,2527,3142]."
[12] "For example, Li et al. reported the formation of irregular networks of pseudo-hexagonal rosettes and [001]-oriented strands on originally flat TiO2(110)(1×1) surfaces through the oxidation of vacuum-annealed crystals at 470 K830 K [36]."
[13] "In addition, Du et al. [39] showed that O2 dissociation at Obr vacancy sites (the first O2 dissociation channel) at room temperature (RT) leads to Oot adatoms left behind in the Ti troughs that are separated by one lattice constant along the [001] direction away from the original Obr vacancy positions [Fig. 2(b)]."
[14] "Moreover, results obtained by our group provided evidence of a non-vacancy-assisted O2 dissociation channel that occurs in addition to the first, vacancy- assisted dissociation channel [32]."
[15] "Upon O2 exposure at RT, this second O2 dissociation channel leads to the formation of paired Oot adatoms on next-nearest 5f-Ti sites in the Ti troughs [Fig. 2(c)]."
[16] "Recently, Du et al. confirmed the formation of Oot adatom pairs on the surface of reduced TiO2(110) crystals upon O2 exposure at RT [42]."
[17] "The occurrence of the second O2 dissociation channel is a strong indication of the existence of charge donors in the near-surface region, since without charge donation the adsorption and dissociation of O2 on TiO2 (110) is predicted to be energetically unfavorable [31,32,4345]."
[18] "The exact nature of the charge donors on the surface of reduced TiO2(110) crystals is still an issue of ongoing research [33,44,4656]."
[19] "For a long time the prevailing opinion in the literature was that the chemistry on reduced TiO2(110) is governed by Obr vacancies [4,6,8,23,24,5761]."
[20] "Consequently, it was thought that the Ti3d defect state in the band gap observed on reduced TiO2 samples [4,12,24,48,59,60,6264] was caused by missing surface O atoms."
[21] "However, this belief was recently disputed [32], because a number of"

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy from the adsorbed oxygen (O2) to drive the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv generally leads to more efficient oxygen adsorption and activation, enhancing the catalytic performance and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

2. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is a key parameter that influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the ΔEv affects the adsorption and activation of oxygen molecules, which in turn impacts the efficiency of the oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen adsorption and activation, thereby boosting the catalytic activity and oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface.
