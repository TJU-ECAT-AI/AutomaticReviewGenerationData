[1] "Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a reducible transition metal oxide that is widely used in a number of technological fields such as photocatalysis, heterogeneous catalysis, solar cells, hydrophilic films, gas sensors, waste remediation, and biocompatible materials [18]."

[2] "Very valuable information has been gained by using these desorption techniques on the O2 interaction with rutile TiO2(110)(1×1). For example, O2-PSD studies by the Yates group [810,16,17] have revealed that the O2-PSD occurs in UHV on O2-exposed TiO2(110) very much as it is observed on high-surface-area TiO2 powder materials [2830]."

[3] "In early surface science studies under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, the interaction of molecular O2 with TiO2 single crystals was studied most frequently using photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) [822]."

[4] "However, based alone on desorption and other spectroscopic techniques insights into reactions on the surface can only be deduced indirectly, which may explain why some of the previous models of the O2TiO2(110) interaction are rather speculative."

[5] "The technique of choice to study the dissociative adsorption of O2 on reduced TiO2(110) is STM. Previous STM studies have unraveled a surprisingly rich and complex interaction of O2 with the reduced TiO2 (110) surface [4,6,2527,3142]."

[6] "The exact nature of the charge donors on the surface of reduced TiO2(110) crystals is still an issue of ongoing research [33,44,4656]."

[7] "The presented TPD and STM data addressing the O2 interaction with low- and medium-reduced TiO2(110)(1×1) crystals are consistent with our previous combined high-resolution STM, photo- electron spectroscopy and DFT study where we proposed that Ti interstitials in the near-surface region are largely responsible for the defect state in the band gap and that these donor specific sites enable the adsorption of electronegative adsorbates such as O2 molecules and Oot adatoms on the surface [32]."

[8] "In agreement with EELS data by Henderson et al. [12] we anticipate that the more Oot adatoms and O2 molecules can be chemisorbed on the TiO2(110) surface the more defect charge is available in the near-surface region,i.e. the larger the Ti3d defect state is."

[9] "Based on the STM data obtained after O2 exposure at LT we can conclude with certainty that the electronic charge stems predominantly from the near-surface region."

2.Oxygen-PSD studies conducted by the Yates group have demonstrated that the O2-PSD occurs on O2-exposed TiO2(110) surfaces in UHV environments in a manner similar to its observation on high-surface-area TiO2 powder materials.

3.Interactions of molecular oxygen with TiO2 single crystals were frequently explored using PSD and TPD techniques in early surface science studies under ultra-high vacuum conditions.

4.Desorption and spectroscopic methods yield indirect insights into surface reactions, which explains why some previous models of the O2TiO2(110) interaction are speculative.

5.STM is the preferred method to investigate the dissociative adsorption of O2 on reduced TiO2(110), revealing a complex interaction with the surface.

6.The nature of charge donors on the surface of reduced TiO2(110) crystals remains an ongoing area of research.

7.The presented TPD and STM data align with prior studies proposing that Ti interstitials in the near-surface region are key for the defect state in the band gap, facilitating the adsorption of electronegative adsorbates like O2 molecules and Oot adatoms.

8.According to EELS data by Henderson et al., the increased presence of Oot adatoms and O2 molecules on the TiO2(110) surface correlates with more defect charge available in the near-surface region, indicating a larger Ti3d defect state.

9.After O2 exposure at low temperatures, the STM data conclusively shows that the electronic charge primarily originates from the near-surface region.
