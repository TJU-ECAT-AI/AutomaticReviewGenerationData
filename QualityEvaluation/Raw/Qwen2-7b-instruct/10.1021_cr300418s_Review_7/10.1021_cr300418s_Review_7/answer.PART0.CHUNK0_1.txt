8 The MarsVan Krevelen Mechanism, the Oxygen Vacancy Formation, and Doping

Most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (MK) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the MK mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface).

According to the crude electron-pair Lewis theory of the chemical bond, removing an oxygen atom from the surface leaves behind two unpaired electrons. This means that an oxygen vacancy is a strong Lewis base. The fate of these electrons depends on whether the oxide is irreducible or reducible. Here, we say that an oxide is irreducible if the cation in it does not make an oxide in which it has a lower valence (e.g., CeO2 is reducible because Ce2O3 exists and is stable; MgO is irreducible because Mg2O does not exist). This means that the cations in the irreducible oxides will not lower their formal charge in the presence of electron donors. When an oxygen vacancy is made on the surface of an irreducible oxide, the unpaired electrons, left behind when the oxygen atom is removed, are localized at the vacancy site.

The energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. This is because a lower ΔEv suggests that it is easier to remove an oxygen atom, making the surface more reactive and thus more effective as an oxidant.

The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing a reductant that is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface layer, not by adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. This process leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies upon the desorption of oxidation products. The role of the gas-phase oxidant is to reoxidize the surface by annihilating the oxygen vacancies. The energy ΔEv required for oxygen vacancy formation is significant in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more reactive and thus more effective as an oxidant, as it is easier to remove an oxygen atom, making the surface more accessible to further reactions.
