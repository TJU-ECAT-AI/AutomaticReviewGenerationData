[1] "According to the crude electron-pair Lewis theory of the chemical bond, (264) removing an oxygen atom from the surface leaves behind two unpaired electrons."
[2] "In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen)."
[3] "When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies."
[4] "We assume that there is a connection between the ability of surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent and the energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy."
[5] "Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions where the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer, rather than by adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy is crucial as it correlates with the ability of the surface oxygen to act as an oxidizing agent. Reducing ΔEv can make the oxide a better oxidant.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中运作方式为，还原剂由氧化物表面层的氧原子氧化，而非吸附氧或气相氧。当氧化产物脱附时，会在表面留下氧空位。形成氧空位所需的能量ΔEv与表面氧作为氧化剂的能力有关。降低ΔEv可以使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂。
