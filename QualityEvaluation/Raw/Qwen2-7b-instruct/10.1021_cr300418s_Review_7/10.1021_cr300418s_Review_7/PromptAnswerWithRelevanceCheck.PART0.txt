8 The MarsVan Krevelen Mechanism, the Oxygen Vacancy Formation, and Doping

Most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (MK) mechanism. In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the MK mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface).

According to the crude electron-pair Lewis theory of the chemical bond, removing an oxygen atom from the surface leaves behind two unpaired electrons. This means that an oxygen vacancy is a strong Lewis base. The fate of these electrons depends on whether the oxide is irreducible or reducible. Here, we say that an oxide is irreducible if the cation in it does not make an oxide in which it has a lower valence (e.g., CeO2 is reducible because Ce2O3 exists and is stable; MgO is irreducible because Mg2O does not exist). This means that the cations in the irreducible oxides will not lower their formal charge in the presence of electron donors. When an oxygen vacancy is made on the surface of an irreducible oxide, the unpaired electrons, left behind when the oxygen atom is removed, are localized at the vacancy site.

The energy ΔEv required for forming an oxygen vacancy is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. To be precise, ΔEv is the energy of the reaction where Ox is the oxide (doped or not) and Oxv is the oxide with an oxygen vacancy on the surface. The assumption is that the smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface. This is because a lower ΔEv suggests that it is easier to remove an oxygen atom, making the surface more reactive and thus more effective as an oxidant.

The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing a reductant that is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface layer, not by adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. This process leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies upon the desorption of oxidation products. The role of the gas-phase oxidant is to reoxidize the surface by annihilating the oxygen vacancies. The energy ΔEv required for oxygen vacancy formation is significant in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more reactive and thus more effective as an oxidant, as it is easier to remove an oxygen atom, making the surface more accessible to further reactions.

8 The MarsVan Krevelen Mechanism, the Oxygen Vacancy Formation, and Doping

According to the crude electron-pair Lewis theory of the chemical bond, removing an oxygen atom from the surface leaves behind two unpaired electrons. This means that an oxygen vacancy is a strong Lewis base. 

In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. 

The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface). 

There is an extensive literature in which ΔEv was calculated. Pirovano, Hoffmann, and Sauer have written an excellent review of these calculations summarizing the situation up to 2007.

For this and other reasons, there is an extensive literature in which ΔEv was calculated.

Oxygen vacancies in reducible oxides have interesting properties. They have been studied for CeO2 and TiO2, which are oxides that can change their oxidation state easily from 4+ to 3+. 

This polaron pair can be located on any pair of cations, and we describe next how one can control these locations. 

The situation is more confusing for oxides for which ΔEv is not as large. Quite a bit of information regarding oxygen vacancies is available for TiO2(110), for which one can perform high-quality STM measurements in UHV.

In what follows, we present some of the computational results that were extrapolated to formulate these rules.

The decrease of ΔEv by low-valence dopants, in less stable oxides (e.g., CeO2, TiO2, NiO, ZnO), is also large but not as dramatic as at (i).

The ability of a dopant to affect ΔEv may vary with the crystalline face of the guest oxide.

In the literature on materials chemistry, it is often stated that doping with an LVD will generate spontaneously an oxygen vacancy for charge compensation.

The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions where the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer, not by adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface, facilitating faster removal of surface oxygen. The literature extensively discusses the calculation of ΔEv for various oxides, especially those doped with low-valence dopants (LVDs). The presence of LVDs affects the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones. The rules formulated based on computational results suggest that doping with an LVD makes the surface more reactive, activating oxygen to bind strongly to Lewis bases, such as CO, H, or an alkyl. The electronic structure of an oxide doped with an LVD involves the appearance of an empty orbital (hole) in the valence band, responsible for the acidity of the doped oxide. The presence of LVDs affects the oxygen vacancy formation and the surface reactivity, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

Answer: 
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reductant being oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface layer, rather than by adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. This mechanism leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies when the oxidation products desorb. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Smaller ΔEv values indicate a better oxidant surface, though it's important to note that a very small ΔEv does not necessarily equate to a good oxidation catalyst. To enhance the oxidizing ability, modifications aiming to decrease ΔEv can be sought. Completing the catalytic cycle requires the gaseous oxidant to be capable of reoxidizing the surface.

8 The MarsVan Krevelen Mechanism, the Oxygen Vacancy Formation, and Doping

In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen).

Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller.

For the majority of oxides whose surface is doped with an LVD, the formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer is endoergic. Often the magnitude of ΔEv ranges between 1 and 2.5 eV, which means that doping with an LVD facilitates the formation of an oxygen vacancy, but oxygen vacancies are not made spontaneously.

The easier it is to remove a surface oxygen atom, the more reactive is that atom. If this is true, a surface doped with LVDs ought to be more reactive than the undoped surfaces.

The appearance of an empty orbital (hole) in the valence band; the LVD is a p-type dopant. This hole is responsible for the acidity of the doped oxide: when a Lewis base binds to the doped oxide, it donates an electron, which fills the hole.

Facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies by modifying the oxide surface, especially through doping with low-valence dopants (LVDs), can enhance its oxidizing power.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过还原剂氧化氧化物表面层的氧原子，而不是吸附的氧或气相氧。氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。通过修改氧化物表面，特别是通过低价掺杂剂（LVD）的掺杂，可以增强其氧化能力。表面氧原子的去除越容易，氧化物表面的活性越高。表面氧原子的可去除性受LVD的影响，与氧化物表面的活性相关。氧化物的酸性归因于价带中出现的空轨道（空穴），这促进了Lewis基的结合并填充空穴。
