8 The MarsVan Krevelen Mechanism, the Oxygen Vacancy Formation, and Doping

In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O). In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen).

Once we accept this idea, we can calculate ΔEv for a quick screening of the oxidative power of various oxides (doped or undoped). Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller.

For the majority of oxides whose surface is doped with an LVD, the formation of an oxygen vacancy in the surface layer is endoergic. Often the magnitude of ΔEv ranges between 1 and 2.5 eV, which means that doping with an LVD facilitates the formation of an oxygen vacancy, but oxygen vacancies are not made spontaneously.

The easier it is to remove a surface oxygen atom, the more reactive is that atom. If this is true, a surface doped with LVDs ought to be more reactive than the undoped surfaces.

The appearance of an empty orbital (hole) in the valence band; the LVD is a p-type dopant. This hole is responsible for the acidity of the doped oxide: when a Lewis base binds to the doped oxide, it donates an electron, which fills the hole.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the reductant to oxidize oxygen atoms from the oxide surface layer, rather than through adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant as it determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies by modifying the oxide surface, especially through doping with low-valence dopants (LVDs), can enhance its oxidizing power. The ease of removing surface oxygen atoms, influenced by the presence of LVDs, correlates with the reactivity of the oxide surface. The acidity of the doped oxide is attributed to the appearance of an empty orbital (hole) in the valence band, which facilitates the binding of Lewis bases and the filling of the hole.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过还原剂氧化氧化物表面层的氧原子，而不是吸附的氧或气相氧。氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。通过修改氧化物表面，特别是通过低价掺杂剂（LVD）的掺杂，可以增强其氧化能力。表面氧原子的去除越容易，氧化物表面的活性越高。表面氧原子的可去除性受LVD的影响，与氧化物表面的活性相关。氧化物的酸性归因于价带中出现的空轨道（空穴），这促进了Lewis基的结合并填充空穴。
