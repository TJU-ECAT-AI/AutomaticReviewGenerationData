[1] "Most oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides take place through a Marsvan Krevelen (226) mechanism."
[2] "In such reactions, the gases introduced in the reactor contain a reductant (e.g., an alkane, CO, H2) and an oxidant (e.g., O2, CO2, N2O)."
[3] "In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen)."
[4] "When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies."

[6] "The smaller is ΔEv, the better oxidant is the surface."
[7] "However, one must keep in mind that a very small ΔEv means that the surface is a good oxidant, but it is not necessarily a good oxidation catalyst."
[8] "Moreover, if we want to make an oxide a better oxidant, we should look for modifications that make ΔEv smaller."

Answer: 
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the reductant being oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxide surface layer, rather than by adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. This mechanism leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies when the oxidation products desorb. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Smaller ΔEv values indicate a better oxidant surface, though it's important to note that a very small ΔEv does not necessarily equate to a good oxidation catalyst. To enhance the oxidizing ability, modifications aiming to decrease ΔEv can be sought. Completing the catalytic cycle requires the gaseous oxidant to be capable of reoxidizing the surface.

火星-范雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是，还原剂被氧化物表面层的氧原子氧化，而不是吸附氧或气相氧。氧化产物脱附时会留下氧空位。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较小的ΔEv值表明表面是一个更好的氧化剂，但需要记住的是，ΔEv非常小并不一定意味着是一个好的氧化催化剂。为了增强氧化能力，可以寻求减少ΔEv的方法。完成催化循环需要气体氧化剂能够重新氧化表面。
