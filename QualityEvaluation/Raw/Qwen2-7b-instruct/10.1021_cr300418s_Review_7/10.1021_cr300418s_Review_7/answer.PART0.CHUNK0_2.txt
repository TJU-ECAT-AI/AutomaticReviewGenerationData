8 The MarsVan Krevelen Mechanism, the Oxygen Vacancy Formation, and Doping

According to the crude electron-pair Lewis theory of the chemical bond, removing an oxygen atom from the surface leaves behind two unpaired electrons. This means that an oxygen vacancy is a strong Lewis base. 

In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer (not by adsorbed oxygen or by gas-phase oxygen). When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. 

The role of the gas-phase oxidant, introduced with the feed, is to annihilate the oxygen vacancies (to reoxidize the surface). 

There is an extensive literature in which ΔEv was calculated. Pirovano, Hoffmann, and Sauer have written an excellent review of these calculations summarizing the situation up to 2007.

For this and other reasons, there is an extensive literature in which ΔEv was calculated.

Oxygen vacancies in reducible oxides have interesting properties. They have been studied for CeO2 and TiO2, which are oxides that can change their oxidation state easily from 4+ to 3+. 

This polaron pair can be located on any pair of cations, and we describe next how one can control these locations. 

The situation is more confusing for oxides for which ΔEv is not as large. Quite a bit of information regarding oxygen vacancies is available for TiO2(110), for which one can perform high-quality STM measurements in UHV.

In what follows, we present some of the computational results that were extrapolated to formulate these rules.

The decrease of ΔEv by low-valence dopants, in less stable oxides (e.g., CeO2, TiO2, NiO, ZnO), is also large but not as dramatic as at (i).

The ability of a dopant to affect ΔEv may vary with the crystalline face of the guest oxide.

In the literature on materials chemistry, it is often stated that doping with an LVD will generate spontaneously an oxygen vacancy for charge compensation.

The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions where the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer, not by adsorbed oxygen or gas-phase oxygen. When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Smaller ΔEv indicates a better oxidant surface, facilitating faster removal of surface oxygen. The literature extensively discusses the calculation of ΔEv for various oxides, especially those doped with low-valence dopants (LVDs). The presence of LVDs affects the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation, making the doped oxides better oxidants than the undoped ones. The rules formulated based on computational results suggest that doping with an LVD makes the surface more reactive, activating oxygen to bind strongly to Lewis bases, such as CO, H, or an alkyl. The electronic structure of an oxide doped with an LVD involves the appearance of an empty orbital (hole) in the valence band, responsible for the acidity of the doped oxide. The presence of LVDs affects the oxygen vacancy formation and the surface reactivity, leading to enhanced catalytic activity.

火星范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中运作方式是，还原剂被氧化物表面层中的氧原子氧化，而不是吸附氧或气相氧。当氧化产物脱附时，会留下氧空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较小的ΔEv表明更好的氧化表面，加速表面氧的去除。文献广泛讨论了各种氧化物的ΔEv计算，特别是掺杂低价元素（LVD）。LVD的存在影响氧空位形成能，使掺杂氧化物成为比未掺杂的更好的氧化剂。基于计算结果制定的规则表明，掺杂LVD会使表面更活跃，激活氧与Lewis基团如CO、H或烷基键合得更强。掺杂氧化物的电子结构涉及价带中出现一个空轨道（空穴），负责掺杂氧化物的酸性。LVD的存在影响氧空位形成和表面活性，导致增强的催化活性。
