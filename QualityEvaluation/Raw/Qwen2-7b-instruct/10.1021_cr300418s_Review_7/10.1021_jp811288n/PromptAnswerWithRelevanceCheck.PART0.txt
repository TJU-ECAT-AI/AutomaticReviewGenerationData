[1] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."
[2] "Oxygen vacancy formation requires the removal of a two-coordinate surface oxygen, and for all four surfaces the excess charge left at the surface localizes strongly at the two neighboring Ti sites, formally reducing these to TiIII and with the local geometry being strongly distorted."
[3] "Relative geometries of these reactive TiIII sites also vary between surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancies as active sites for the adsorption and dissociation of molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, leading to a higher concentration of reactive TiIII sites. These sites facilitate the reaction by providing new bands between 0.7 and 2.1 eV below the conduction band minimum, which are likely to be involved in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules. The varying geometries of these reactive TiIII sites across different surfaces suggest that the oxygen vacancy sites may exhibit strong variation in redox behavior, potentially modifying the reactivity of experimental samples where nonequilibrium surface distributions are expressed.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为分子吸附和分解的活性位点来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，从而导致更髙的活性TiIII位点浓度。这些位点通过提供位于导带底部以下0.7至2.1电子伏特的新能级来促进反应，这些能级可能涉及吸附分子的还原性反应。不同表面上这些活性TiIII位点的相对几何结构的变化表明，氧空位位点可能表现出强烈的还原行为差异，这可能修改实验样品中的表面分布不均衡时的反应活性。

1. Oxygen vacancy formation energies increase in the sequence ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101). These energies are crucial for determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as they relate to the energy required for oxygen vacancies to form.

2. Defect states resulting from oxygen vacancies act as frontier orbitals, meaning they are at the boundary between the valence and conduction bands. They are likely to participate in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules, due to their involvement in the transfer of electrons.

3. The geometric arrangements of the reactive TiIII sites differ across various oxide surfaces.

4. The variation in electronic and geometric properties of these TiIII sites across different oxide surfaces suggests that oxygen vacancy sites can exhibit significant differences in reactivity, particularly when the surface distribution is not in equilibrium.

[2] "The application of DFT + U to the Ti d states is successful at recovering the localized polaronic nature of the occupied defect states, where the occupied and unoccupied states are well described by combinations of atomic-like Ti 3d functions."
[3] "Since the occupied defect states and unoccupied conduction band states are both predominantly Ti 3d in character, it is expected that the distances between the defect state peaks and the bottom of the conduction band are more physically meaningful than the position of the defect states relative to the top of the valence band, for which substantial errors remain due to the use of DFT."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms or oxygen-containing species from the oxide surface to reactant molecules, thereby enabling the oxidative transformation of substrates. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically indicate a greater stabilization of the oxygen vacancy, which can lead to a more localized defect state near the surface. This localized state acts as a frontier orbital, potentially accelerating the reaction kinetics by providing a reactive site for the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of molecules. The geometric and electronic variations among different surfaces also affect the reactivity of the TiIII sites, which are influenced by the energy of the defect states. These variations suggest that the redox behavior and reactivity of the oxide surface can be significantly modulated depending on the surface composition and structure.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面与反应物分子之间的氧原子或含氧物种的转移，从而实现对底物的氧化转化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较高的ΔEv值通常意味着氧空位的更大稳定化，这可以导致更接近表面的缺陷状态的局部化。这种局部化的状态作为前线轨道起作用，可能通过提供吸附和随后氧化分子的活性位点来加速反应动力学。不同表面的几何和电子变化也影响TiIII位点的反应性，这些位点受缺陷状态能级的影响。这些变化表明，根据表面组成和结构的不同，氧化物表面的还原行为和反应性可以显著改变。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are sites of electron deficiency that facilitate the adsorption of reactant molecules and enable redox reactions to occur. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This is because fewer activation energies are needed for reactant molecules to adsorb onto the surface and participate in the redox reactions. Moreover, the presence of these oxygen vacancies introduces defect states into the bandgap of the oxide, which are involved in redox reactions with adsorbed molecules. The specific geometry and energetics of these defect states vary across different oxide surfaces, influencing their reactivity and catalytic performance.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位来操作。氧空位是电子不足的位点，能够促进反应分子的吸附并使还原反应发生。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。更低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更容易形成，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为反应分子需要更低的活化能才能吸附到表面并参与还原反应。此外，这些氧空位在氧化物的带隙中引入缺陷状态，这些状态与吸附分子进行红ox反应。不同氧化物表面的这些缺陷状态的特定几何结构和能量特性存在差异，影响它们的反应性和催化性能。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to an adsorbed molecule, thereby oxidizing it. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, which could enhance the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions by providing more reactive sites. However, the specific value of ΔEv alone does not fully determine the mechanism's effectiveness, as the surface's geometry and electronic properties, influenced by ΔEv, also impact the reaction pathways and rates.
