[1] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."
[2] "Oxygen vacancy formation requires the removal of a two-coordinate surface oxygen, and for all four surfaces the excess charge left at the surface localizes strongly at the two neighboring Ti sites, formally reducing these to TiIII and with the local geometry being strongly distorted."
[3] "Relative geometries of these reactive TiIII sites also vary between surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancies as active sites for the adsorption and dissociation of molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, leading to a higher concentration of reactive TiIII sites. These sites facilitate the reaction by providing new bands between 0.7 and 2.1 eV below the conduction band minimum, which are likely to be involved in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules. The varying geometries of these reactive TiIII sites across different surfaces suggest that the oxygen vacancy sites may exhibit strong variation in redox behavior, potentially modifying the reactivity of experimental samples where nonequilibrium surface distributions are expressed.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为分子吸附和分解的活性位点来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，从而导致更髙的活性TiIII位点浓度。这些位点通过提供位于导带底部以下0.7至2.1电子伏特的新能级来促进反应，这些能级可能涉及吸附分子的还原性反应。不同表面上这些活性TiIII位点的相对几何结构的变化表明，氧空位位点可能表现出强烈的还原行为差异，这可能修改实验样品中的表面分布不均衡时的反应活性。
