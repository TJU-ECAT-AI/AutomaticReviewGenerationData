[1] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."
[2] "The application of DFT + U to the Ti d states is successful at recovering the localized polaronic nature of the occupied defect states, where the occupied and unoccupied states are well described by combinations of atomic-like Ti 3d functions."
[3] "Since the occupied defect states and unoccupied conduction band states are both predominantly Ti 3d in character, it is expected that the distances between the defect state peaks and the bottom of the conduction band are more physically meaningful than the position of the defect states relative to the top of the valence band, for which substantial errors remain due to the use of DFT."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms or oxygen-containing species from the oxide surface to reactant molecules, thereby enabling the oxidative transformation of substrates. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically indicate a greater stabilization of the oxygen vacancy, which can lead to a more localized defect state near the surface. This localized state acts as a frontier orbital, potentially accelerating the reaction kinetics by providing a reactive site for the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of molecules. The geometric and electronic variations among different surfaces also affect the reactivity of the TiIII sites, which are influenced by the energy of the defect states. These variations suggest that the redox behavior and reactivity of the oxide surface can be significantly modulated depending on the surface composition and structure.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面与反应物分子之间的氧原子或含氧物种的转移，从而实现对底物的氧化转化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较高的ΔEv值通常意味着氧空位的更大稳定化，这可以导致更接近表面的缺陷状态的局部化。这种局部化的状态作为前线轨道起作用，可能通过提供吸附和随后氧化分子的活性位点来加速反应动力学。不同表面的几何和电子变化也影响TiIII位点的反应性，这些位点受缺陷状态能级的影响。这些变化表明，根据表面组成和结构的不同，氧化物表面的还原行为和反应性可以显著改变。
