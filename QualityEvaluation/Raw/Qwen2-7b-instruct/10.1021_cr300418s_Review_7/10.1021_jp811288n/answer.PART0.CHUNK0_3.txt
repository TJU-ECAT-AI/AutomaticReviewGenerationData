[1] "The ease with which oxygen vacancies can be formed is thought to contribute to the catalytic behavior of TiO2, since this creates reactive sites into which molecules can adsorb."
[2] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."
[3] "Since O-deficient surfaces possess an electron excess, these defect states constitute frontier orbitals, and are likely to be involved in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules."
[4] "Relative geometries of these reactive TiIII sites also vary between surfaces. The (110) and (100) reduced surfaces have pairs of symmetric occupied Ti orbitals, with variation in the angle these project from the surface, and the (101) and (001) reduced surfaces have asymmetric occupied Ti orbitals."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are sites of electron deficiency that facilitate the adsorption of reactant molecules and enable redox reactions to occur. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This is because fewer activation energies are needed for reactant molecules to adsorb onto the surface and participate in the redox reactions. Moreover, the presence of these oxygen vacancies introduces defect states into the bandgap of the oxide, which are involved in redox reactions with adsorbed molecules. The specific geometry and energetics of these defect states vary across different oxide surfaces, influencing their reactivity and catalytic performance.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位来操作。氧空位是电子不足的位点，能够促进反应分子的吸附并使还原反应发生。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。更低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更容易形成，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为反应分子需要更低的活化能才能吸附到表面并参与还原反应。此外，这些氧空位在氧化物的带隙中引入缺陷状态，这些状态与吸附分子进行红ox反应。不同氧化物表面的这些缺陷状态的特定几何结构和能量特性存在差异，影响它们的反应性和催化性能。
