[1] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."
[2] "Relative geometries of these reactive TiIII sites also vary between surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to an adsorbed molecule, thereby oxidizing it. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, which could enhance the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions by providing more reactive sites. However, the specific value of ΔEv alone does not fully determine the mechanism's effectiveness, as the surface's geometry and electronic properties, influenced by ΔEv, also impact the reaction pathways and rates.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面向吸附分子转移氧原子，从而实现氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性影响。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更容易形成氧空位，这可能增强表面促进氧化反应的能力，因为它提供了更多的活性位点。然而，仅凭ΔEv值并不能完全确定机制的有效性，因为受ΔEv影响的表面几何形状和电子性质也会影响反应路径和速率。
