[1] "Vacancy formation energies vary as ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)."
[2] "Since O-deficient surfaces possess an electron excess, these defect states constitute frontier orbitals, and are likely to be involved in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules."
[3] "Relative geometries of these reactive TiIII sites also vary between surfaces."
[4] "These electronic and geometric variations suggest that O vacancy sites at different TiO2 surfaces may show strong variation in redox behavior, with possible corresponding modification of reactivity for experimental samples where nonequilibrium surface distributions are expressed."

1. Oxygen vacancy formation energies increase in the sequence ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101). These energies are crucial for determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as they relate to the energy required for oxygen vacancies to form.

2. Defect states resulting from oxygen vacancies act as frontier orbitals, meaning they are at the boundary between the valence and conduction bands. They are likely to participate in redox reactions involving adsorbed molecules, due to their involvement in the transfer of electrons.

3. The geometric arrangements of the reactive TiIII sites differ across various oxide surfaces.

4. The variation in electronic and geometric properties of these TiIII sites across different oxide surfaces suggests that oxygen vacancy sites can exhibit significant differences in reactivity, particularly when the surface distribution is not in equilibrium.

1. 氧空位形成能按ΔEvac(100) > ΔEvac(110) > ΔEvac(001) > ΔEvac(101)递增。这些能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为它们与氧空位形成所需的能量有关。

2. 由于氧缺陷表面存在电子过剩，这些缺陷状态构成边界轨道，很可能参与吸附分子的还原反应，因为它们涉及电子转移。

3. 这些活性TiIII点的几何排列在不同氧化物表面上各不相同。

4. 这些TiIII点在不同氧化物表面的电子和几何特性的变化表明，氧空位点可以表现出显著的反应性差异，特别是在表面分布非平衡的情况下。
