[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the oxide catalyst. This oxygen vacancy acts as a reactive site where oxygen atoms can be easily removed. When the reaction conditions are favorable, these oxygen atoms are then transferred to the substrate undergoing oxidation."
[2] "The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for the oxide surface to form oxygen vacancies, which enhances its catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the ease of oxygen atom removal."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of an oxide catalyst, acting as a reactive site for oxygen atom removal. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, with lower ΔEv values enhancing these properties due to easier oxygen atom removal.

火星-范克列伦机制通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位来运作，这些氧空位作为活性位点用于氧气原子的去除。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，较低的ΔEv值可以增强这些性质，因为氧气原子更易被去除。
