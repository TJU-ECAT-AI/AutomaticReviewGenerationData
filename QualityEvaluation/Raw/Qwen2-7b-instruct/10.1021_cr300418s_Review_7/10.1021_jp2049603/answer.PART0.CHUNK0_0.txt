The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen atoms on the surface of the catalyst. In this mechanism, the catalyst provides an environment for the oxidation of a substance, typically involving the loss of electrons by the substance to be oxidized. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is low, the catalyst is more likely to lose oxygen atoms easily, which enhances its oxidizing ability. However, if the energy is too low, the catalyst might lose oxygen too easily, potentially reducing its activity and selectivity in the oxidation process. Thus, a balance must be achieved to ensure that the catalyst can effectively remove oxygen atoms for oxidation purposes without losing its functionality too quickly.

火星-范雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用催化剂表面的氧原子来运行。在此机制下，催化剂为被氧化物质提供了一个环境，通常涉及被氧化物质失去电子的过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当氧空位形成能较低时，催化剂更容易快速释放氧原子，这增强了其氧化能力。然而，如果能量过低，催化剂可能过快地丢失氧原子，这可能会降低其活性和选择性。因此，需要找到一个平衡点，确保催化剂能够有效地去除氧原子进行氧化过程，同时保持其功能不丧失得太快。
