[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation and recombination of oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This mechanism is characterized by the facile formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface, which enhances the surface's oxidizing ability."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is significant because it reflects the ease with which the surface can lose oxygen atoms. A low ΔEv indicates that oxygen is easily removed from the surface, making the surface a strong oxidant."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism facilitates oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by enabling the formation and recombination of oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability. A low ΔEv signifies that oxygen is easily lost from the surface, enhancing its oxidizing power.

火星-范克里夫机制通过使氧化物表面能够形成和重组氧原子来促进氧化物催化氧化反应。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）影响表面的催化活性和氧化能力。低ΔEv表明氧容易从表面逸出，从而增强其氧化能力。
