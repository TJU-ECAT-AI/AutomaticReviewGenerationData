The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and regeneration of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the ease with which oxygen can be removed from the surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen is easier to remove, making the surface a better oxidant. However, if the ΔEv is too low, the surface may lose oxygen too easily, reducing its effectiveness as a catalyst since it becomes difficult to replenish the oxygen. Thus, a balance is sought where the surface is capable of both effectively removing oxygen and regenerating it, enhancing the catalytic activity.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位的形成和再生运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）具有重要意义，因为它决定了氧从表面去除的容易程度。ΔEv较低表示氧更容易去除，使表面成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv太低，表面可能过容易失去氧，降低其作为催化剂的效果，因为很难补充氧。因此，寻求一种平衡状态，在这种状态下，表面能够有效去除氧并重新生成，从而增强催化活性。
