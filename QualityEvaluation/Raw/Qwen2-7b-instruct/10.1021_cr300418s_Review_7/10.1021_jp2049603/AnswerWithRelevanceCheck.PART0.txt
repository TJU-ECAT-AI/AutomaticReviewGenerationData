          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen atoms on the surface of the catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A low ΔEv indicates that oxygen is easier to remove from the surface, making the surface a better oxidant. However, if the ΔEv is too low, the surface may lose oxygen too easily, reducing its effectiveness as a catalyst since it becomes difficult to replenish the oxygen. Thus, a balance is sought where the surface is capable of both effectively removing oxygen and regenerating it, enhancing the catalytic activity.

          火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用催化剂表面的氧原子来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。ΔEv较低表示氧更容易从表面去除，使表面成为更好的氧化剂。然而，如果ΔEv太低，表面可能过容易失去氧，降低其作为催化剂的效果，因为很难补充氧。因此，寻求一种平衡状态，在这种状态下，表面能够有效去除氧并重新生成，从而增强催化活性。

          [1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation and recombination of oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This mechanism is characterized by the facile formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface, which enhances the surface's oxidizing ability."
          [2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is significant because it reflects the ease with which the surface can lose oxygen atoms. A low ΔEv indicates that oxygen is easily removed from the surface, making the surface a strong oxidant."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by enabling the formation and recombination of oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability. A low ΔEv signifies that oxygen is easily lost from the surface, enhancing its oxidizing power.
