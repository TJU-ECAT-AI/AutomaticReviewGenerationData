[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These oxygen vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of substrates."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a qualitative descriptor of the oxidative power of an oxide. Lower ΔEv values indicate a greater ability to form oxygen vacancies and thus a stronger oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the surface of oxide catalysts for substrate oxidation in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) serves as a qualitative measure of the oxide's oxidative power, with lower ΔEv values indicating enhanced oxidizing ability.
