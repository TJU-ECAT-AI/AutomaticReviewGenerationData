Direct Partial Oxidation of Methane to Synthesis Gas by Cerium Oxide Kiyoshi Otsuka,1 Ye Wang, Eiyuh Sunada, and Ichiro Yamanaka Department of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152, Japan Received May 16, 1997; revised November 20, 1997; accepted November 21, 1997 The gassolid reaction between methane and cerium oxide (CeO2) directly produced a synthesis gas with H2/CO ratio of 2.
The addition of Pt black remarkably accelerated the formation rates of H2 and CO and decreased the activation energy for the production of the synthesis gas. The hydrogen-exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 proceeded remarkably faster than the oxi- dation of methane with CeO2 regardless of the presence or absence of Pt. Thus, It was suggested that the cleavage of the CH bond of methane could not be the rate-determining step. The small ki- netic isotopic effect (kH/kD = 1.1  0.1) in methane conversion sug- gested that the step involving hydrogen such as the recombination or desorption of hydrogen could be the rate-determining step. H2, CO, and a small amount of CH4 were observed in temperature- programmed desorption experiments for the chemisorbed species generated on CeO2 during the reaction with methane. This result along with the in situ FT-IR spectroscopic results suggested that the reaction proceeded not through HCHO but probably through carbon intermediate. CO must be produced by the reaction of the carbon with the lattice oxygen of CeO2. TPD experiments showed that the presence of Pt remarkably decreased the temperature for the desorptions of H2 and CO. The obvious tailing of H2 formation in the reaction of CeO2 with methane pulse also indicated that the recombination or desorption of hydrogen was the rate-determining step. It was suggested that Pt accelerated this step probably through a reverse spillover mechanism.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps. Initially, an oxygen atom is abstracted from a hydrocarbon molecule, forming a hydroperoxide intermediate. Subsequently, a water molecule donates a proton to the hydroperoxide, regenerating the oxide surface and yielding an alcohol as the final product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, leading to more efficient surface oxygen availability for reaction. The document provides evidence for this concept through the observation of enhanced catalytic performance and reduced activation energy upon the addition of platinum (Pt) as a catalyst, which accelerates the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, suggesting an influence on the recombination or desorption of hydrogen, possibly through a reverse spillover mechanism.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作。首先，从碳氢化合物分子中抽取一个氧原子，形成过氧化物中间体。随后，水分子捐赠一个质子给过氧化物，再生出氧化物表面，并产生醇作为最终产物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它促进了氧空位的更容易形成，从而提高了表面氧气的可用性以进行反应。文献提供了这一概念的证据，通过观察铂（Pt）作为催化剂时增强的催化性能和降低的活化能，加速了氢和一氧化碳的形成，暗示对氢的再组合或脱附的影响，可能通过逆溢流机制实现。
