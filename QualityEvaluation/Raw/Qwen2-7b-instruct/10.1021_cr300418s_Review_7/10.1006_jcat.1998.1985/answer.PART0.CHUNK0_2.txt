[1] "The formation rate of CO was increased in the presence of Pt at all the temperatures investigated."
[2] "The presence of Pt black obviously accelerated the formation of H2 and CO."
[3] "Thus, Pt accelerated the stoichiometric reaction of Eq. [5] without depositing carbon."
[4] "The addition of Pt as a catalyst remarkably accelerated the formation rates of H2 and CO."
[5] "The low isotope effect (kH/kD = 1.1  0.1) further indicates that another elementary step involving hydrogen atoms must control the reaction."
[6] "The presence of Pt accelerates this step as shown by the TPD measurement."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power due to more efficient electron transfer and oxygen atom availability for the reaction. The mechanism involves the oxidation of reactants at the surface of the oxide, facilitated by the oxygen vacancies, which can accept electrons and facilitate the transfer of oxygen atoms to the reactants. This leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ions or hydroxyl radicals, which then react with the substrates to form products.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位（Ov）来操作。氧化物间隙的能量要求（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv通常表示更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为可以更有效地进行电子转移和氧原子可用于反应。该机制涉及在氧化物表面上氧化反应物，由氧空位促进，氧空位可以接受电子并促进氧原子转移到反应物。这导致形成活性氧物种，如超氧离子或羟基自由基，然后与底物反应形成产品。
