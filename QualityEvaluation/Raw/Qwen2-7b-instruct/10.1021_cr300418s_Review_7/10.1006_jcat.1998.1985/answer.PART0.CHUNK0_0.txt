The gassolid reaction between methane and cerium oxide (CeO2) directly produced a synthesis gas with H2/CO ratio of 2.

The addition of Pt black remarkably accelerated the formation rates of H2 and CO and decreased the activation energy for the production of the synthesis gas.

The hydrogen-exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 proceeded remarkably faster than the oxi- dation of methane with CeO2 regardless of the presence or absence of Pt.

The small kinetic isotopic effect (kH/kD = 1.1  0.1) in methane conversion sug- gested that the step involving hydrogen such as the recombination or desorption of hydrogen could be the rate-determining step.

TPD experiments showed that the presence of Pt remarkably decreased the temperature for the desorptions of H2 and CO.

The obvious tailing of H2 formation in the reaction of CeO2 with methane pulse also indicated that the recombination or desorption of hydrogen was the rate-determining step.

It was suggested that Pt accelerated this step probably through a reverse spillover mechanism.

The reaction of CH4 with Pt black (30 mg) without CeO2 produced only a small amount of H2 (ca. 1% of that in the presence of CeO2).

The formation rate of CO was increased in the presence of Pt at all the temperatures investigated.

The degree of reduction of CeO2 after the reaction with CH4 for 2 h at different temperatures were plotted in Fig. 6.

The FT-IR experiments suggested that the formation of H2 and CO would not proceed through intermediates such as adsorbed CH3OH (or CH3O) and HCHO.

The TPD measurement for the chemisorbed species after the reaction of CH4 with CeO2 suggested that adsorbed carbonaceous species and hydrogen atoms were probably the reaction intermediates.

The reaction may proceed as follows: CH4 C(a) + 4H(a), 4H(a) 2H2, xC(a) + CeO2 xCO + CeO2x.

The obvious tailing of H2 in the transient response pulse reaction suggests that the step for the formation of H2, which involves the recombination of hydrogen atoms and the desorption of H2, is a slow step.

The presence of Pt accelerates this step as shown by the TPD measurement.

We speculate that this enhancement may be achieved by a reverse spillover mechanism, viz., the spillover of H atoms trapped in the surroundings of Ce3+ to Pt sites where the recombi- nation of H atoms or the desorption of H2 must occur more facilely.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and/or protons between reactants and the oxide surface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial for the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as they can stabilize reactive intermediates and lower the activation energy for the reaction pathways.

2. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its impact on both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher mobility of oxygen atoms, allowing for easier formation of oxygen vacancies and thus potentially enhancing the catalytic performance and oxidizing power of the surface. Conversely, a higher ΔEv may hinder the formation of oxygen vacancies, reducing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

3. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism facilitates the oxidation of methane by transferring electrons and/or protons to the cerium oxide (CeO2) surface, enabling the formation of oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies play a critical role in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the CeO2 surface.

4. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values promote easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the catalytic performance and oxidizing power of the surface. Higher ΔEv values, however, may limit the formation of oxygen vacancies, negatively affecting the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

5. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism enables the selective conversion of methane to hydrogen and carbon monoxide by transferring electrons and/or protons to the cerium oxide surface, facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies that act as active sites for the reaction.

6. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) has a substantial impact on the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values are conducive to the easy formation of oxygen vacancies, thereby boosting the catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the surface. Higher ΔEv values, on the other hand, may impede the formation of oxygen vacancies, resulting in diminished catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

7. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is responsible for the selective conversion of methane into hydrogen and carbon monoxide by transferring electrons and/or protons to the cerium oxide surface, which facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies that serve as active sites for the reaction.

8. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a pivotal role in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values enhance the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, thereby improving the catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the surface. Conversely, higher ΔEv values may restrict oxygen vacancy formation, leading to reduced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.
