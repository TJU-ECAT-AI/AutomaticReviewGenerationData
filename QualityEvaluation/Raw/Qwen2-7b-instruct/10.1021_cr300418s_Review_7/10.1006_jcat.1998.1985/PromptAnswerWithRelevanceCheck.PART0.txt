JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS 175, 152160 (1998)

The gassolid reaction between methane and cerium oxide (CeO2) directly produced a synthesis gas with H2/CO ratio of 2.

The addition of Pt black remarkably accelerated the formation rates of H2 and CO and decreased the activation energy for the production of the synthesis gas.

The hydrogen-exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 proceeded remarkably faster than the oxi- dation of methane with CeO2 regardless of the presence or absence of Pt.

The small kinetic isotopic effect (kH/kD = 1.1  0.1) in methane conversion sug- gested that the step involving hydrogen such as the recombination or desorption of hydrogen could be the rate-determining step.

TPD experiments showed that the presence of Pt remarkably decreased the temperature for the desorptions of H2 and CO.

The obvious tailing of H2 formation in the reaction of CeO2 with methane pulse also indicated that the recombination or desorption of hydrogen was the rate-determining step.

It was suggested that Pt accelerated this step probably through a reverse spillover mechanism.

The reaction of CH4 with Pt black (30 mg) without CeO2 produced only a small amount of H2 (ca. 1% of that in the presence of CeO2).

The formation rate of CO was increased in the presence of Pt at all the temperatures investigated.

The degree of reduction of CeO2 after the reaction with CH4 for 2 h at different temperatures were plotted in Fig. 6.

The FT-IR experiments suggested that the formation of H2 and CO would not proceed through intermediates such as adsorbed CH3OH (or CH3O) and HCHO.

The TPD measurement for the chemisorbed species after the reaction of CH4 with CeO2 suggested that adsorbed carbonaceous species and hydrogen atoms were probably the reaction intermediates.

The reaction may proceed as follows: CH4 C(a) + 4H(a), 4H(a) 2H2, xC(a) + CeO2 xCO + CeO2x.

The obvious tailing of H2 in the transient response pulse reaction suggests that the step for the formation of H2, which involves the recombination of hydrogen atoms and the desorption of H2, is a slow step.

The presence of Pt accelerates this step as shown by the TPD measurement.

We speculate that this enhancement may be achieved by a reverse spillover mechanism, viz., the spillover of H atoms trapped in the surroundings of Ce3+ to Pt sites where the recombi- nation of H atoms or the desorption of H2 must occur more facilely.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and/or protons between reactants and the oxide surface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial for the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as they can stabilize reactive intermediates and lower the activation energy for the reaction pathways.

2. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its impact on both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher mobility of oxygen atoms, allowing for easier formation of oxygen vacancies and thus potentially enhancing the catalytic performance and oxidizing power of the surface. Conversely, a higher ΔEv may hinder the formation of oxygen vacancies, reducing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

3. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism facilitates the oxidation of methane by transferring electrons and/or protons to the cerium oxide (CeO2) surface, enabling the formation of oxygen vacancies. These oxygen vacancies play a critical role in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the CeO2 surface.

4. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values promote easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the catalytic performance and oxidizing power of the surface. Higher ΔEv values, however, may limit the formation of oxygen vacancies, negatively affecting the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

5. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism enables the selective conversion of methane to hydrogen and carbon monoxide by transferring electrons and/or protons to the cerium oxide surface, facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies that act as active sites for the reaction.

6. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) has a substantial impact on the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values are conducive to the easy formation of oxygen vacancies, thereby boosting the catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the surface. Higher ΔEv values, on the other hand, may impede the formation of oxygen vacancies, resulting in diminished catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

7. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is responsible for the selective conversion of methane into hydrogen and carbon monoxide by transferring electrons and/or protons to the cerium oxide surface, which facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies that serve as active sites for the reaction.

8. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a pivotal role in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values enhance the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, thereby improving the catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the surface. Conversely, higher ΔEv values may restrict oxygen vacancy formation, leading to reduced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power due to more efficient electron transfer and oxygen atom availability for the reaction. The mechanism involves the oxidation of reactants at the surface of the oxide, facilitated by the oxygen vacancies, which can accept electrons and facilitate the transfer of oxygen atoms to the reactants. This leads to the formation of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide ions or hydroxyl radicals, which then react with the substrates to form products.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial in providing active sites for the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically leads to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power because it facilitates easier creation and utilization of oxygen vacancies.

2. The presence of platinum (Pt) remarkably accelerates the formation rates of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. Platinum decreases the activation energy required for the synthesis gas production, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics.

3. The small kinetic isotopic effect (kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1) in the conversion of methane suggests that the rate-determining step involves hydrogen, specifically either the recombination or desorption of hydrogen atoms. This implies that these hydrogen-related processes play a critical role in the overall reaction mechanism.

4. The observation of a noticeable tailing in the formation of hydrogen (H2) in the pulse reaction with ceria (CeO2) indicates that the recombination or desorption of hydrogen is the rate-determining step in the formation of synthesis gas.

5. The enhancement in the formation of hydrogen (H2) through the presence of platinum is speculated to be achieved by a reverse spillover mechanism. This mechanism involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the surroundings of cerium(III) (Ce3+) sites to platinum (Pt) sites. At these Pt sites, the recombination of hydrogen atoms or the desorption of hydrogen becomes more facile, thus accelerating the hydrogen formation process.

Direct Partial Oxidation of Methane to Synthesis Gas by Cerium Oxide Kiyoshi Otsuka,1 Ye Wang, Eiyuh Sunada, and Ichiro Yamanaka Department of Chemical Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Ookayama, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 152, Japan Received May 16, 1997; revised November 20, 1997; accepted November 21, 1997 The gassolid reaction between methane and cerium oxide (CeO2) directly produced a synthesis gas with H2/CO ratio of 2.
The addition of Pt black remarkably accelerated the formation rates of H2 and CO and decreased the activation energy for the production of the synthesis gas. The hydrogen-exchange reaction between CH4 and CD4 proceeded remarkably faster than the oxi- dation of methane with CeO2 regardless of the presence or absence of Pt.

H2, CO, and a small amount of CH4 were observed in temperature- programmed desorption experiments for the chemisorbed species generated on CeO2 during the reaction with methane. This result along with the in situ FT-IR spectroscopic results suggested that the reaction proceeded not through HCHO but probably through carbon intermediate. CO must be produced by the reaction of the carbon with the lattice oxygen of CeO2. TPD experiments showed that the presence of Pt remarkably decreased the temperature for the desorptions of H2 and CO.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps. Initially, an oxygen atom is abstracted from a hydrocarbon molecule, forming a hydroperoxide intermediate. Subsequently, a water molecule donates a proton to the hydroperoxide, regenerating the oxide surface and yielding an alcohol as the final product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, leading to more efficient surface oxygen availability for reaction. The document provides evidence for this concept through the observation of enhanced catalytic performance and reduced activation energy upon the addition of platinum (Pt) as a catalyst, which accelerates the formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, suggesting an influence on the recombination or desorption of hydrogen, possibly through a reverse spillover mechanism.
