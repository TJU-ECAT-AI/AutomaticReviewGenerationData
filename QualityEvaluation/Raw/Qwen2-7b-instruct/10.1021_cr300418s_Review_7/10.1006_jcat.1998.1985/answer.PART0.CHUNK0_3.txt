[1] "The formation rate of CO was increased in the presence of Pt at all the temperatures investigated."
[2] "The addition of Pt black remarkably accelerated the formation rates of H2 and CO and decreased the activation energy for the production of the synthesis gas."
[3] "The small kinetic isotopic effect (kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1) in methane conversion suggested that the step involving hydrogen such as the recombination or desorption of hydrogen could be the rate-determining step."
[4] "The obvious tailing of H2 formation in the reaction of CeO2 with methane pulse also indicated that the recombination or desorption of hydrogen was the rate-determining step."
[5] "We speculate that this enhancement may be achieved by a reverse spillover mechanism, viz., the spillover of H atoms trapped in the surroundings of Ce3+ to Pt sites where the recombi- nation of H atoms or the desorption of H2 must occur more facilely."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies are crucial in providing active sites for the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically leads to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power because it facilitates easier creation and utilization of oxygen vacancies.

2. The presence of platinum (Pt) remarkably accelerates the formation rates of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. Platinum decreases the activation energy required for the synthesis gas production, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics.

3. The small kinetic isotopic effect (kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1) in the conversion of methane suggests that the rate-determining step involves hydrogen, specifically either the recombination or desorption of hydrogen atoms. This implies that these hydrogen-related processes play a critical role in the overall reaction mechanism.

4. The observation of a noticeable tailing in the formation of hydrogen (H2) in the pulse reaction with ceria (CeO2) indicates that the recombination or desorption of hydrogen is the rate-determining step in the formation of synthesis gas.

5. The enhancement in the formation of hydrogen (H2) through the presence of platinum is speculated to be achieved by a reverse spillover mechanism. This mechanism involves the transfer of hydrogen atoms from the surroundings of cerium(III) (Ce3+) sites to platinum (Pt) sites. At these Pt sites, the recombination of hydrogen atoms or the desorption of hydrogen becomes more facile, thus accelerating the hydrogen formation process.

1. 罗斯-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位起作用。氧空位对于氧化过程至关重要，提供活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）显著影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv通常导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它使创建和利用氧空位变得更加容易。

2. 铂（Pt）的存在显著加快了甲烷氧化合成气过程中氢（H2）和碳（CO）的形成速率。铂降低了生成合成气所需的活化能，从而增强反应动力学。

3. 甲烷转化的小动力学同位素效应（kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1）表明涉及氢的步骤是决定性步骤，具体来说是氢的再组合或脱附。这暗示这些与氢相关的进程在总体反应机制中起着关键作用。

4. 在脉冲反应中观察到氢（H2）形成出现明显的尾部现象，表明氢的再组合或脱附是合成气形成过程中的决定性步骤。

5. 通过铂的增强氢（H2）形成的推测实现由逆向溢出机制。这种机制涉及氢原子从铈（III）（Ce3+）位点周围的环境中向铂（Pt）位点的转移。在这些Pt位点，氢原子的再组合或氢的脱附变得更为容易，从而加速了氢的形成过程。
