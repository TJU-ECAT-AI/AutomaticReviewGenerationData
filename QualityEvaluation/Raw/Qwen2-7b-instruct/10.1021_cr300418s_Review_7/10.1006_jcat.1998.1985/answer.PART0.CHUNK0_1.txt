[1] "The degree of reduction of cerium oxide after a complete reaction with CH4 (until neither H2 nor CO formation was observed) reached 21%, suggesting that almost all the CeO2 was reduced to Ce2O3."
[2] "The low isotope effect (kH/kD = 1.1  0.1) is consistent with the results of CH4CD4 exchange reactions that the cleavage of CH4 is not the rate-determining step."
[3] "This low isotope effect further indicates that another elementary step involving hydrogen atoms must control the reaction."
[4] "The obvious tailing of H2 in the transient response pulse reaction suggests that the step for the formation of H2, which involves the recombination of hydrogen atoms and the des- orption of H2, is a slow step."
[5] "The presence of Pt accelerates this step as shown by the TPD measurement. We speculate that this enhancement may be achieved by a reverse spillover mechanism, viz., the spillover of H atoms trapped in the surroundings of Ce3+ to Pt sites where the recombi- nation of H atoms or the desorption of H2 must occur more facilely."

1. The degree of reduction of cerium oxide after reacting completely with methane until no further formation of H2 or CO was observed was 21%, indicating that nearly all CeO2 was reduced to Ce2O3. 
2. The low isotope effect (kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1) is consistent with the CH4CD4 exchange reactions, suggesting that the cleavage of CH4 is not the rate-determining step in the reaction.
3. This low isotope effect further implies that another hydrogen-involved elementary step controls the reaction process.
4. The tailing of H2 in the transient response pulse reaction indicates that the step involving hydrogen atom recombination and H2 desorption is a slow process.
5. The presence of Pt accelerates this step, potentially through a reverse spillover mechanism, allowing more facile hydrogen atom recombination or H2 desorption at Pt sites compared to Ce3+ sites.

1. 在完全反应甲烷后，铈氧化物的还原度达到了21%，这意味着几乎所有CeO2都还原为Ce2O3。
2. 低同位素效应（kH/kD = 1.1 ± 0.1）与CH4CD4交换反应的结果一致，表明CH4的断裂不是决定性步骤。
3. 这个低同位素效应进一步表明，另一个涉及氢原子的基元步骤控制着反应过程。
4. 传回应脉冲反应中H2的尾部现象表明，涉及氢原子重组合和H2脱附的步骤是一个缓慢的过程。
5. Pt的存在加速了这一步骤，可能通过逆溢出机制实现，使Pt位点上氢原子重组合或H2脱附比Ce3+位点更加容易。
