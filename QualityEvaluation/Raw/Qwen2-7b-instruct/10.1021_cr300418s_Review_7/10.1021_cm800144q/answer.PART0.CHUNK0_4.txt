The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation of an active adsorbate species on the oxide surface, its subsequent oxidation, and the release of the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher reactivity, as it facilitates easier creation and migration of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for efficient electron transfer and reaction intermediates stabilization.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作，涉及在氧化物表面形成活性吸附物种、随后对其进行氧化以及释放氧化产物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的反应性，因为它便于更容易地创建和迁移氧空位，这对于有效电子转移和反应中间体稳定化至关重要。
