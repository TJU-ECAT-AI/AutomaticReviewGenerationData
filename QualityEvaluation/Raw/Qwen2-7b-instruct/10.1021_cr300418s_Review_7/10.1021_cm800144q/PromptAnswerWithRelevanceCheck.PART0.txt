Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically leads to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power due to increased surface reactivity.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
答案：Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位而运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv通常会导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，这是由于表面反应性的增加所致。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation of an active adsorbate species on the oxide surface, its subsequent oxidation, and the release of the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher reactivity, as it facilitates easier creation and migration of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for efficient electron transfer and reaction intermediates stabilization.
