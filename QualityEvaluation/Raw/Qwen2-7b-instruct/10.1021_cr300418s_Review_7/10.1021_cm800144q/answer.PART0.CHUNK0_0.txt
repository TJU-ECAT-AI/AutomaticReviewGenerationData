<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the sequential formation of surface intermediates characterized by oxygen vacancies. The energy needed for the creation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) plays a critical role in defining both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface.
