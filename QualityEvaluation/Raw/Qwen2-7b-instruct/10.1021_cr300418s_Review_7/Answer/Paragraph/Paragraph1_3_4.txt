            The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation involves Al atoms substituting Si atoms with minimal lattice distortion, maintaining local C2 symmetry. The even spin density distribution around Al atoms contrasts with theoretical predictions. The presence of a hole leads to localized spin density on the four nearest oxygen neighbors of the impurity atom. Bond elongation, explained by electrostatic effects related to the ionic character of the bonds, indicates the Al3+ core binds less strongly to oxygen atoms than the Si4+ core.

The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv leads to lower catalytic activity but higher oxidizing power. This is because a higher ΔEv means that more energy is needed to create an oxygen vacancy, which in turn makes the surface less available for reaction, thus reducing catalytic activity. However, it also implies that the surface is better at oxidizing substances due to the higher energy barrier for adsorption and reaction.

            In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves oxygen molecule adsorption, oxygen vacancy formation, and subsequent reaction with reactants. Oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) critically influences catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Higher ΔEv values typically enhance catalytic activity by creating a more favorable energy profile for reaction intermediates, but excessive values may reduce reactivity by limiting active sites. This highlights ΔEv's pivotal role in balancing stability and reactivity in oxide catalysts. Catalysis is vital for industrial processes and increasingly important in controlling pollution and environmental management.
