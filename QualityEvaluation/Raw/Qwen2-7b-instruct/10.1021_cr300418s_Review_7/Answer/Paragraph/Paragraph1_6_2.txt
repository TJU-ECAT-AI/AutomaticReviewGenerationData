            The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions relies on ΔEv for driving the reaction by facilitating oxygen vacancy formation, which affects catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Lower ΔEv values enhance catalytic performance by reducing activation energy. Oxygen vacancies have localized impacts on the electronic structure, influencing nearby atoms but sparing those distant. The size of the system minimizes interactions between defects. The presence of Al positions determines potential-energy curves for carriers in optical channels, highlighting the critical role of oxygen vacancy formation in the mechanism's efficiency.
            The most significant changes induced by the defect are represented by the occurrence of impurity states, prevalently located in the energy range between 25.0 and 24.0 eV, corresponding to p-like Al and O bonding orbitals. Variations are strictly localized and involve the electronic structure around host atoms which are directly bonded to the extrinsic defect. On the other hand, atoms sufficiently far away from the impurity are unaffected by the presence of Al. Moreover, the size of our system seems to be sufficiently large to minimize the interactions between neighboring defects. An averaged potential-energy curve for a light carrier ion e.g., Li 1, H 1), trapped in an optical channel of the defective quartz and which does not perturb the host lattice during its motion, has been determined as a function of its location with respect to the Al position.
            The calculations illustrate both the variations in chemical activity from one transition metal to the next and the effect of geometry. The results show that, even though the accuracy of DFT calculations is not at present sufficient to predict absolute chemical reaction rates, it is good enough to predict the overall variations in rates from one system to the next. The consequences of the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi relation in terms of the kinetics of the ammonia synthesis process under industrial conditions are discussed, and it is shown that the relation leads to a volcano-type dependence of the catalytic activity on the nitrogen heat of adsorption. Fe and Ru are near the maximum, closely resembling what is found experimentally (12).
            The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests. The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase.
            In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the even spin density distribution on oxygen neighbors by Al atoms, minimal lattice distortion during Al substitution, and hole-induced localized spin density. Bond elongation, attributed to electrostatic effects due to ionic bonding, explains differences between Al-O and Si-O bonds. These mechanisms highlight the critical role of oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) in determining catalytic activity and surface oxidizing ability.
            The solubility corresponds to the maximum concentration that the impurity can attain in the semiconductor, under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. Increasing the abundance of the impurity or its chemical potential, see Sec. II E! does not necessarily increase the concentration of impurities incorporated in the solid, because it may become more favorable for the impurity to form a different phase. Formation energies have to be calculated for each relevant charge state. The stable charge state is then the one which has the lowest formation energy for a given Fermi level. Equation 2! shows that the formation energy of charged impurities takes into account that electrons are exchanged with the Fermi level.
            Our results show that the spin density is evenly distributed on the four oxygen nearest neighbors to Al in contrast to phenomenological model results. The Al atom substitutes the Si atom with little lattice distortion and maintaining the local C2 symmetry of the Si site. The hole is found to produce a spin density equally localized on the four nearest-neighbors oxygens of the impurity atom. The elongation of the Al-O bonds with respect to the Si-O bonds mentioned in Sec. III A is due to electrostatic effects related to the ionic character of the bonds: the Al3+ core is less bound to oxygens than the Si4+ core.
            The high catalytic activity of nanosized gold clusters at low temperature is found to be related to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to activate reactants. Although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature. The origin of the nanoeffects in the catalytic properties of these metals is widely debated,15 and no consensus has been reached.
            In this work, we perform first-principles density functional theory plus U (DFT+U) calculations to investigate the thermodynamic, electronic, and structural properties of Cu/CeO₂(111) surfaces and interfaces. The Cu adatom on the stoichiometric CeO₂(111) surface is energetically favorable. The Cu/CeO₂(111) interface exhibits a strong interaction between Cu and CeO₂. The ΔEv for oxygen vacancy formation is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
            After impregnation, the support consists of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide. Reduction at 623 K yields Rh/LaO(OH). A reduction temp. of 723 K is necessary to obtain the Rh/La2O3 catalyst. In contrast to the dehydration of the support, the reduction of the carbonated phase is strongly activated by the presence of Rh. The calculations illustrate both the variations in chemical activity from one transition metal to the next and the effect of geometry. The results show that, even though the accuracy of DFT calculations is not at present sufficient to predict absolute chemical reaction rates, it is good enough to predict the overall variations in rates from one system to the next.
            In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, the surface of the oxide plays a crucial role in the catalytic oxidation of CO. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

            最显著的变化是由缺陷引起的，表现为Al原子周围的25.0至24.0 eV能量范围内的主要杂质状态，对应于p型Al和O结合轨道。变化严格局限于涉及直接与缺陷相连的宿主原子的电子结构。另一方面，足够远的原子不受Al的影响。此外，系统的大小似乎足够大，以最小化相邻缺陷之间的相互作用。对于在缺陷石英中运动时不扰动基体晶格的轻载离子（例如Li 1, H 1），已经确定了其相对于Al位置的平均势能曲线。
            在氧化物催化氧化反应中，马斯-范克里韦伦机制涉及Al原子周围氧邻域的均匀自旋密度分布，几乎没有晶格失真期间的Si原子替换，以及孔导致的自旋密度均匀地定位在杂质原子的四个最近邻氧上。Al-O键长度与Si-O键长度之间的拉长归因于由于离子键的静电效应：Al3+核比Si4+核更少束缚到氧上。
            我们的研究表明，纳米尺寸的金簇在低温下的高催化活性与低配位金属原子激活反应的能力有关。虽然铂和钯在高温下是扩展表面的最活跃催化剂，但金在低温下对非常小的粒子是最活跃的催化剂。这些金属的催化性质的纳米效应的起源正在广泛辩论中，尚未达成共识。
            在这项工作中，我们进行了第一原理的密度泛函理论加U（DFT+U）计算，以研究Cu/CeO₂(111)表面和界面的热力学、电子和结构性质。在stoichiometric CeO₂(111)表面上的Cu原子是能量有利的。Cu/CeO₂(111)界面表现出Cu和CeO₂之间的强烈相互作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。
            在此之后，通过浸渍，支持物由部分碳酸镧氢氧化物组成。在623 K的还原产生Rh/LaO(OH)。需要723 K的还原温度才能获得Rh/La2O3催化剂。与支持物的脱水相比，在碳化相的还原被Rh的存在强烈激活。计算显示了从一个过渡金属到另一个过渡金属的化学活性的变化以及几何形状的影响。结果表明，尽管密度泛函理论的准确性目前不足以预测绝对化学反应速率，但它足以预测从一个系统到另一个系统的变化率的整体差异。
