        The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves oxygen vacancy formation and migration. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is pivotal, impacting both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

        The paper outlines a method for correlating continuous descriptors of catalytic materials with their performance in catalytic processes, employing molar fractions of individual components as descriptors. Correlation measures are applied to catalytic data to link catalyst composition with performance, contrasting this approach with analysis of variance and regression trees.

        We find that adsorbed Cr is oxidised to Cr2+, reducing one 5-fold coordinated surface Ti ion to Ti3+ while the remaining electron is delocalised over neighbouring surface Ti. Upon exposing the doped surface to oxygen, both experiment and modelling show that the Ti3+ defect is preferentially re-oxidised and electrons are withdrawn from the surface region, with adsorbed Cr further oxidised to Cr(III).

        The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv), which significantly impacts catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

        The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions is characterized by the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv), which dictates the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv leads to lower catalytic activity but higher oxidizing power, as explained in the text. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate the variations in chemical activity from one transition metal to the next and the effect of geometry. The results show that, despite the current limitations of DFT in predicting absolute chemical reaction rates, it is capable of predicting overall variations in rates from one system to another.

        The solgel method facilitates the uniform distribution of active metals, enhancing catalyst preparation. Metal combinations affect crystalline phase structures, with the La-Fe doped zirconia showing superior performance due to its dominant tetragonal phase. Large cavities in ZrO2 enable efficient transport of reactants and products, supporting enhanced catalytic activity.

        According to the crude electron-pair Lewis theory of the chemical bond, removing an oxygen atom from the surface leaves behind two unpaired electrons. In the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism, the reductant is oxidized by the oxygen atoms from the oxides surface layer. When the oxidation products desorb, they leave behind oxygen vacancies, indicating surface oxidizing capability. Key is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv), correlating with surface oxidizing ability; lowering ΔEv enhances oxide as an oxidant.

        Catalysis is important academically and industrially. Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material. The origin of nanoeffects in the catalytic properties of metals is widely debated, and no consensus has been reached. The high catalytic activity of nanosized gold clusters at low temperature is found to be related to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to activate reactants. Although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature. The debate around nanoeffects in catalytic properties highlights the unique activity of gold nanoparticles, as supported by quotes comparing their performance to platinum and palladium at high temperatures and low temperatures respectively.

        Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety of technological applications. Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide systems.

        Electrodeposition of α-Fe2O3 doped with Mo or Cr as photoanodes for photocatalytic water splitting demonstrates the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism's operation in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

        Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies. The lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant. Doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for oxidation, particularly when dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant.
