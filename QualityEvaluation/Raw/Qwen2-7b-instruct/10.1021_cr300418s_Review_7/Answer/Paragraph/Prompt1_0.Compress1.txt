Oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is pivotal in determining catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. By lowering ΔEv through doping, oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, enhancing the oxide surface's reactivity. Doping facilitates the mechanism by making oxygen atoms more susceptible to removal, improving catalyst efficiency. High-valence dopants, like copper in La2O3, reduce ΔEv, enabling facile oxygen vacancy formation, which isn't eager to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, thus boosting the catalyst's overall activity and efficiency. Oxygen vacancies' availability for binding electrophilic reactants, like O2, amplifies the catalytic process.", "Doi": "10.1021/jp103604b"},
