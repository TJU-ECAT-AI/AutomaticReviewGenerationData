    "Summary": "Both review articles effectively explore the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, ΔEv, and the role of oxygen vacancies in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. They share a high degree of similarity in terms of content quality, structure and organization, academic standards, innovation and contribution, and practical application value. The articles are well-written, with clear arguments and feasible suggestions. However, they lack a particularly innovative perspective or groundbreaking research direction, and their research designs could benefit from greater rigor. Both articles are equally strong in their presentation of recent literature and practical implications. The slight difference in the clarity of research methods and the rigor of research design indicates that Review A may offer slightly more refined methodologies."
