      <English>
          The inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst serves as an alternative to traditional direct setups for preferential CO oxidation in hydrogen-rich streams. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the creation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.
