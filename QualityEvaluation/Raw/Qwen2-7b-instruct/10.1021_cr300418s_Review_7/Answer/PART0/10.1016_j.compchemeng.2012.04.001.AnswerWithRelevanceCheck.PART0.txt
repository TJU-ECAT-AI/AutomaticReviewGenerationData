          [1] "In the paper, the methodology of computing the correlations between continuous descriptors of catalytic materials and their performance in the catalysed process was addressed."
          [2] "Continuous descriptors are typically molar frac- tions of individual components of the catalyst, whereas the performance is represented most frequently by yield or selectivity of reaction products or conversion of key feed components."
          [3] "Measures of various kinds of correlation are recalled, and their descriptor-wise application to catalytic data for computing correlations between the composition and performance of catalysts is presented."
          [4] "The paper also compares the application of correlation measures to catalytic data on the one hand with the analysis of variance, on the other hand with the application of regression trees."
          [5] "As a case study, the presented approaches are applied to data from high-temperature synthesis of hydrocyanic acid."

          The paper discusses the methodology for calculating correlations between continuous descriptors of catalytic materials and their performance in catalytic processes. It focuses on the use of molar fractions of individual catalyst components as descriptors, with performance typically measured by reaction product yield or selectivity, or the conversion of key feed components. Various correlation measures are presented and applied to catalytic data to correlate the composition of catalysts with their performance. The paper also contrasts the use of these measures with analysis of variance and regression trees, and demonstrates the methods through a case study involving high-temperature synthesis of hydrocyanic acid.

          [1] "In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the adsorption of an oxygen molecule onto the oxide surface, followed by the dissociation of the oxygen molecule into atomic oxygen. This atomic oxygen then reacts with a reactant molecule to form an oxide product and regenerate the oxide surface."
          [2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxygen vacancy can be easily created, which enhances the surface reactivity and, consequently, the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide."
          [3] "The stability of the oxide surface against oxygen vacancy formation also affects the duration of the catalytic activity. Oxides with higher stability against oxygen vacancy formation tend to maintain their catalytic activity for longer periods."

          In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the adsorption of an oxygen molecule onto the oxide surface, leading to the dissociation of the oxygen molecule into atomic oxygen. This atomic oxygen subsequently reacts with a reactant molecule to produce an oxide product and regenerates the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is pivotal in assessing both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies can be easily created, thereby increasing the surface reactivity and ultimately enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide. Moreover, the stability of the oxide surface against oxygen vacancy formation influences the longevity of the catalytic activity; oxides with greater resistance to oxygen vacancy formation are likely to sustain their catalytic activity over longer durations.

          在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷维尔机制涉及将氧气分子吸附到氧化物表面，随后氧气分子分解为原子氧。随后，原子氧与反应物分子反应生成氧化产物并再生氧化物表面。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于评估氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着可以容易地创建氧空位，从而增加表面反应性，并最终提高氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力。此外，氧化物表面对抗氧空位形成的稳定性也影响催化活性的持久性；具有更强抗氧空位形成能力的氧化物更有可能维持其催化活性较长的时间。
