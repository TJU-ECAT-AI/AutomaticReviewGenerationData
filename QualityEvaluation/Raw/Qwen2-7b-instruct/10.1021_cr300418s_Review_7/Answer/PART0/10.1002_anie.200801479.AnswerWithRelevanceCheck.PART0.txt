          "The high catalytic activity of nanosized gold clusters at low temperature is found to be related to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to activate reactants."
          "Although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature."
          "The origin of the nanoeffects in the catalytic properties of these metals is widely debated,15 and no consensus has been reached."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv), where the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Gold nanoparticles, with their ability to effectively activate reactants, exhibit higher catalytic activity compared to other metal nanoparticles, especially at low temperatures. The mechanism's operation is also influenced by the coordination number of metal atoms, with lower-coordinated atoms serving as active sites for enhanced catalytic performance.

          "Trends in the Catalytic CO Oxidation Activity of Nanoparticles Graphical Abstract Going for gold: Density functional calculations show how gold nanoparticles are more active catalysts for CO oxidation than other metal nanoparticles."
          "Although extended gold surfaces are generally considered chemically inert1,2 nanosized (<5nm) gold particles can be very effective catalysts for a number of oxidation reactions.317"
          "The adsorption is considerably more exothermic on the twelve-atom clusters than on the close-packed surfaces."
          "Gold is closest to the top, followed by palladium and silver."
          "The results in Figure2 and Figure4 are in good agreement with available experimental observations.3,32"

          The high catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles towards CO oxidation is attributed to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to activate reactants, making gold more effective than other metal nanoparticles. Extended gold surfaces, while chemically inert, are highly active catalysts for various oxidation reactions when reduced to nanoscale sizes. The adsorption process on twelve-atom clusters is notably more exothermic compared to close-packed surfaces, indicating a preference for certain reaction pathways. The positioning of metals in terms of reactivity shows gold at the top, followed by palladium and silver, supporting the findings with experimental data.

          金纳米粒子在CO氧化反应中的高催化活性归因于低配位金属原子激活反应物的能力，使其比其他金属纳米粒子更为有效。虽然延展的金表面通常被认为是化学惰性的，但当减小到纳米尺度时，它们成为各种氧化反应的有效催化剂。十二个原子簇上的吸附过程明显比紧密排列的表面更放热，表明偏好某些反应途径。金属在反应性排序中的位置显示黄金处于顶部，其次是钯和银，这些发现与实验数据一致。
