The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. As mentioned in the literature, when Cr is adsorbed on the TiO2(110) surface, it forms a Cr2+ ion, which reduces a 5-fold coordinated surface Ti atom to Ti3+. This reduction leads to structural distortions in neighboring O atoms. When the doped surface is exposed to oxygen, the Ti3+ defect is preferentially re-oxidized, and electrons are withdrawn from the surface region. Simultaneously, the adsorbed Cr further oxidizes to Cr3+. The adsorption of oxygen at Cr leads to an energy gain of 1.88 eV, contributing to the re-oxidation of the surface and the formation of a peroxo (O2 2) species.", "Chinese": "火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来操作。氧空位形成的能量影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。如文献所述，当Cr吸附在TiO2(110)表面上时，它形成一个Cr2+离子，并将表面5配位的Ti原子还原为Ti3+。这种还原导致相邻O原子的几何结构变形。当镀层表面暴露于氧气时，Ti3+缺陷被优先氧化，从表面区域抽出电子。同时，吸附在Cr上的Cr进一步氧化为Cr3+。氧气吸附在Cr上导致1.88 eV的能量增加，有助于表面的重新氧化并形成过氧（O2 2）物种。", "Doi": "10.1039/b819724e"},

This is because a lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen atoms are more reactive and easier to remove, which enhances the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxide surface, is a key factor in this process. An example of this mechanism in action is the activation of alkanes, where the breaking of the CH bond results in the binding of the H atom and the alkyl group to two oxygen atoms on the surface of the oxide. By reducing ΔEv through surface modifications, we can facilitate the easy formation of oxygen vacancies, which are more reactive and can bind electrophilic reactants like O2, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
