The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. As mentioned in the literature, when Cr is adsorbed on the TiO2(110) surface, it forms a Cr2+ ion, which reduces a 5-fold coordinated surface Ti atom to Ti3+. This reduction leads to structural distortions in neighboring O atoms. When the doped surface is exposed to oxygen, the Ti3+ defect is preferentially re-oxidized, and electrons are withdrawn from the surface region. Simultaneously, the adsorbed Cr further oxidizes to Cr3+. The adsorption of oxygen at Cr leads to an energy gain of 1.88 eV, contributing to the re-oxidation of the surface and the formation of a peroxo (O2 2) species.

Regular meditation can notably decrease stress levels. Participants who engaged in mindfulness meditation experienced a reduction in cortisol, a hormone linked to stress. This practice also led to improvements in mood and emotional well-being among the participants. These results imply that integrating meditation into daily activities could provide significant advantages for mental health.

Improving the activity of lanthanum oxide requires modifications to the surface that lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This is because a lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen atoms are more reactive and easier to remove, which enhances the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxide surface, is a key factor in this process. An example of this mechanism in action is the activation of alkanes, where the breaking of the CH bond results in the binding of the H atom and the alkyl group to two oxygen atoms on the surface of the oxide. By reducing ΔEv through surface modifications, we can facilitate the easy formation of oxygen vacancies, which are more reactive and can bind electrophilic reactants like O2, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Our findings confirm that all the dopants tested lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation significantly, as predicted by the propensity rule.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the surface is more active in promoting oxidation reactions due to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which facilitates the transfer of electrons and the activation of reactants. Conversely, a higher ΔEv indicates a less active surface, as the formation of oxygen vacancies becomes more energetically demanding, thus hindering the catalytic efficiency of the oxide.
