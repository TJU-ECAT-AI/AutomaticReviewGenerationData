[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation and recombination of oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. This mechanism is characterized by the facile formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the surface, which enhances the surface's oxidizing ability."
          [2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is significant because it reflects the ease with which the surface can lose oxygen atoms. A low ΔEv indicates that oxygen is easily removed from the surface, making the surface a strong oxidant."

[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released when oxygen vacancies are formed (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. This energy is significant because it determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates a more active catalyst capable of facilitating faster oxidation rates."
          [2] "In the context of the literature provided, the ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is a critical factor. It represents the energy released upon the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is harnessed to enhance the reaction kinetics and efficiency. This energy release is essential for the activation of the reactants and the subsequent oxidation process."
          [3] "Essentially, the ΔEv acts as a driving force in the oxidation reaction, enabling the catalyst to perform its function more effectively. The higher the ΔEv, the more efficient the catalyst is at oxidizing substances, contributing to a faster reaction rate and greater conversion efficiency."
