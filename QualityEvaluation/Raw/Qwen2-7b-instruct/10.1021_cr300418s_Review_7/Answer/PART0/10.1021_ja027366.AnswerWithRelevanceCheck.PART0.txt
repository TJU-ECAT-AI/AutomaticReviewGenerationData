          [3] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
          [4] "A lower ΔEv typically indicates higher reactivity and better catalytic performance."
          [5] "Conversely, a lower ΔEv can also improve the oxidizing ability as it facilitates the generation of reactive oxygen species."

      <English>
          The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values generally enhance catalytic activity due to increased surface reactivity. Moreover, lower ΔEv can also boost the oxidizing ability by promoting the creation of reactive oxygen species.
