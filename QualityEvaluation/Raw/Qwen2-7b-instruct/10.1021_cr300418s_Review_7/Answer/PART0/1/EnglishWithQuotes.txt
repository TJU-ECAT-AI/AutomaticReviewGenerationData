This mechanism relies on the energy needed for oxygen to leave the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. This process affects the surface's ability to adsorb and oxidize reactants. The higher the ΔEv, the more energy is required for oxygen to desorb, which can potentially reduce the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a lower ΔEv allows for easier desorption of oxygen, enhancing the surface's ability to catalyze reactions effectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can predict the relative catalytic activity of different transition metals, with iron (Fe) and ruthenium (Ru) being among the best choices for catalysts, matching experimental findings closely.", "Doi": "10.1006/jcat.2000.3087"},
