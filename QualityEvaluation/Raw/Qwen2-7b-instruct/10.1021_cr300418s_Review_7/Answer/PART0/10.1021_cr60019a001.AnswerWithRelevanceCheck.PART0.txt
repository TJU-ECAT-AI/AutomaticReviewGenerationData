          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of an adsorbed oxygen species on the oxide surface, which then facilitates the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
