          [I] "The most significant changes induced by the defect are represented by the occurrence of impurity states, prevalently located in the energy range between 25.0 and 24.0 eV, corresponding to p-like Al and O bonding orbitals."
          [II] "The variations are strictly localized and involve the electronic structure around host atoms which are directly bonded to the extrinsic defect."
          [III] "On the other hand, atoms sufficiently far away from the impurity are unaffected by the presence of Al."
          [IV] "Moreover, the size of our system seems to be sufficiently large to minimize the interactions between neighboring defects."
          [V] "Finally, an averaged potential-energy curve for a light carrier ion e.g., Li 1, H 1), trapped in an optical channel of the defective quartz and which does not perturb the host lattice during its motion, has been determined as a function of its location with respect to the Al position."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. The ΔEv determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically leads to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power, facilitating the reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to proceed.

          在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克雷伦机制通过利用氧空位（ΔEv）形成的能量来推动反应前进。ΔEv决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv通常导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力，通过降低反应进行所需的活化能来促进反应。

          [1] "An aluminum defect in quartz has been studied by means of all-electron calculations based on the full-potential linearized-augmented-plane-wave method."
          [2] "The Al impurity introduces levels between the bonding and nonbonding states of pure SiO 2 a quartz; these features are shown to derive from the formation of the Al-O chemical bond."
          [3] "In this regard, we obtained insights from a parallel study of a-Al2O3, whose relevant results are also preliminarily discussed in the present work."
          [4] "The dangling bond in the @AlO4) 1/2#2 unit is evenly shared among the four oxygen atoms adjacent to the defect."
          [5] "No bias of the charge density around the impurity is observed."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power.
