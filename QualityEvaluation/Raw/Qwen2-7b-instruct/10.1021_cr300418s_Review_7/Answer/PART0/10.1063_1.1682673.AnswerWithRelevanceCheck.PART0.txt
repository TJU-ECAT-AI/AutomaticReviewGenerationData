          [1] "The solubility corresponds to the maximum concentration that the impurity can attain in the semiconductor, under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium."
          [2] "Increasing the abundance of the impurity or its chemical potential, see Sec. II E! does not necessarily increase the concentration of impurities incorporated in the solid, because it may become more favorable for the impurity to form a different phase."
          [3] "Formation energies have to be calculated for each relevant charge state. The stable charge state is then the one which has the lowest formation energy for a given Fermi level."
          [4] "Equation 2! shows that the formation energy of charged impurities takes into account that electrons are exchanged with the Fermi level."

          [1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released when oxygen vacancies are formed (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. This energy is significant because it determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates a more active catalyst capable of facilitating faster oxidation rates."
          [2] "In the context of the literature provided, the ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface is a critical factor. It represents the energy released upon the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is harnessed to enhance the reaction kinetics and efficiency. This energy release is essential for the activation of the reactants and the subsequent oxidation process."
          [3] "Essentially, the ΔEv acts as a driving force in the oxidation reaction, enabling the catalyst to perform its function more effectively. The higher the ΔEv, the more efficient the catalyst is at oxidizing substances, contributing to a faster reaction rate and greater conversion efficiency."
