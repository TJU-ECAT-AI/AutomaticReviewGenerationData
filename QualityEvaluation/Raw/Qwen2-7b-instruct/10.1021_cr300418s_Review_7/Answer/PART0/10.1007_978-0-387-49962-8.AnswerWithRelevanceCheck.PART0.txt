          [1] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
          [2] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
          [3] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
          [4] "As recently as sixty years ago, Rideal and Taylor could still treat the subject comprehensively in a single volume, but by the 1950s, Emmett required six volumes, and no conventional multivolume text could now cover the whole of catalysis in any depth."
          [5] "Catalysis is important academically and industrially."
          [6] "It plays an essential role in the manufacture of a wide range of products, from gasoline and plastics to fertilizers and herbicides, which would otherwise be unobtainable or prohibitively expensive."
          [7] "Apart from manufacturing processes, catalysis is finding other important and ever increasing uses; for example, successful applications of catalysis in the control of pollution and its use in environmental control are certain to increase in the future."
          [8] "Increasing research activity over the years has brought deeper levels of understanding, and these have been associated with a continually growing amount of published material."
          [9] "In view of this situation, we felt there was a need for a collection of monographs, each one of which would deal at an advanced level with a selected topic, so as to build a catalysis"

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of oxygen molecules, the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface, and the subsequent reaction of the adsorbed species with reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically lead to more stable surfaces, which can result in enhanced catalytic activity due to a more favorable energy profile for the reaction intermediates. However, too high ΔEv might hinder the reactivity by reducing the availability of active sites for the reaction. Thus, ΔEv acts as a crucial parameter in determining the balance between stability and reactivity in oxide catalysts.

          火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作，涉及氧分子的吸附、表面氧空位的形成以及吸附物种与反应物的后续反应。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。较高的ΔEv值通常导致更稳定的表面，这可以由于反应中间体的能量剖面更加有利而导致增强的催化活性。然而，ΔEv值过高可能会阻碍活性，通过减少活性位点的可用性来降低反应性。因此，ΔEv作为确定氧化物催化剂稳定性与活性之间平衡的关键参数。
