<quotes>
[1] "The Deacon process has been known for about 130 years, but industrial production through this route was only established recently by Sumitomo Chemicals using a RuO2 catalyst supported on TiO2."
[2] "Importantly, the volcano curve can be based on just one descriptor, the dissociative oxygen chemisorption, which potentially allows for the fast computational screening for new catalysts."
[3] "It is found that the commonly employed RuO2 catalyst is close to optimal, but that there could still be room for improvements."
[4] "Our analysis also suggests that it would be possible to run the Deacon process with a reasonable TOF at reaction temperatures that are about 100K lower than those used for RuO2 catalysts, if one would be able to find an oxide material with the optimal catalytic properties."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy plays a crucial role in assessing the efficiency of the surface in promoting the desired chemical transformations. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, which is essential for the effective adsorption and activation of reactants on the surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv plays a crucial role in assessing how effectively the surface can facilitate the oxidation process. The energy difference indicates the ease with which oxygen can be removed from the surface, which directly correlates with the surface's ability to participate in and promote oxidation reactions. A lower ΔEv signifies a stronger tendency for oxygen to desorb, enhancing the surface's oxidizing capability. Consequently, in determining the efficiency of the oxide surface in catalyzing oxidation reactions, the ΔEv serves as a critical parameter that reflects the balance between the adsorption and desorption of oxygen species, thereby influencing the overall catalytic activity and selectivity of the surface towards specific oxidation pathways.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (oxygen vacancies, ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) affects the stability of the oxide surface and its ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions. Lower ΔEv indicates a more stable surface with a higher tendency to form oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the catalytic activity by providing additional reactive sites for the oxidation process. Consequently, the significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the balance between the stability of the oxide surface and its reactivity, thereby influencing the overall efficiency of the oxide catalyst in promoting the desired oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Catalysts with lower ΔEv values tend to exhibit higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to more efficient oxygen vacancy formation, which facilitates the reaction pathways and enhances the reaction rates. Replacing expensive catalysts like RuO2 with cheaper alternatives that maintain or improve the ΔEv values could lead to more cost-effective and efficient catalysts for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.
