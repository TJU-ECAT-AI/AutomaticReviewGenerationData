[1] "Importantly, the volcano curve can be based on just one descriptor, the dissociative oxygen chemisorption, which potentially allows for the fast computational screening for new catalysts."
[2] "It is found that the commonly employed RuO2 catalyst is close to optimal, but that there could still be room for improvements."
[3] "Our calculations support that chlorination of the surface does indeed occur under reaction conditions and we analyze how it influences the performance of the actual catalyst."
[4] "By comparing the thermodynamics of the reaction on the RuO2(110) surface with those on TiO2(110) and IrO2(110), we find the key parameters determining the activity of the catalytically active surface."
[5] "The volcano-curve is derived from the thermodynamics of the reaction and the catalytic activity of the catalysts."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy is crucial as it affects the thermodynamics of the reaction, thereby influencing the rate and efficiency of the catalytic process. The volcano-curve, derived from the thermodynamics of the reaction and the catalytic activity of the catalysts, illustrates the relationship between ΔEv and the catalytic performance, allowing for the computational screening of new catalysts.
