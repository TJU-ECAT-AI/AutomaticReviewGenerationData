[1] "The Deacon process has been known for about 130 years, but industrial production through this route was only established recently by Sumitomo Chemicals using a RuO2 catalyst supported on TiO2."
[2] "It is found that the commonly employed RuO2 catalyst is close to optimal, but that there could still be room for improvements."
[3] "By comparing the thermodynamics of the reaction on the RuO2(110) surface with those on TiO2(110) and IrO2(110), we find the key parameters determining the activity of the catalytically active surface."
[4] "Our calculations support that chlorination of the surface does indeed occur under reaction conditions and we analyze how it influences the performance of the actual catalyst."
[5] "Linear energy relations for the elementary reaction steps are obtained from the DFT calculations and used to establish a one-dimensional descriptor for the catalytic activity."
[6] "The volcano curve can be based on just one descriptor, the dissociative oxygen chemisorption, which potentially allows for the fast computational screening for new catalysts."
[7] "The descriptor employed here is the dissociative chemisorption energy of oxygen."
[8] "It is found that the commonly employed RuO2 catalyst is close to optimal, but that there could still be room for improvements."
[9] "The analysis suggests that oxide surfaces which offer slightly weaker bonding of oxygen should exhibit a superior activity to that of RuO2."
[10] "At 573K, the ruthenium catalyst with oxygen in the bridge position is on top of the volcano."
[11] "Chlorine production is found to take off at around 500K."
[12] "Our model, a more optimal choice of the catalyst could theoretically increase the TOF at 500K to about 20s−1, thus increasing the catalytic activity by more than an order of magnitude."
[13] "Linear energy relations combined with microkinetic modeling can thus potentially provide a powerful tool for the computational discovery of new oxide materials for catalytic processes."
[14] "Having established the volcano relationship for the Deacon process, new catalytic materials can now be screened based on the dissociative oxygen adsorption energy alone."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv plays a crucial role in assessing how effectively the surface can facilitate the oxidation process. The energy difference indicates the ease with which oxygen can be removed from the surface, which directly correlates with the surface's ability to participate in and promote oxidation reactions. A lower ΔEv signifies a stronger tendency for oxygen to desorb, enhancing the surface's oxidizing capability. Consequently, in determining the efficiency of the oxide surface in catalyzing oxidation reactions, the ΔEv serves as a critical parameter that reflects the balance between the adsorption and desorption of oxygen species, thereby influencing the overall catalytic activity and selectivity of the surface towards specific oxidation pathways.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv在评估表面如何有效促进氧化过程方面起着关键作用。该能量差表明氧从表面去除的倾向性，直接反映了表面促进氧化反应的能力。较低的ΔEv意味着氧更易于从表面脱附，从而增强表面的氧化能力。因此，在评估氧化物表面在催化氧化反应中的效率时，ΔEv作为关键参数，反映了吸附和脱附氧物种之间的平衡，进而影响表面的整体催化活性和特定氧化途径的选择性。
