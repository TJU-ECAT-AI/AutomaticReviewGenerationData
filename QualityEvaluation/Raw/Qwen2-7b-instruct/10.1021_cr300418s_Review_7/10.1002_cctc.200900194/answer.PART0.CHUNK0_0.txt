[1] "The Deacon process has been known for about 130 years, but industrial production through this route was only established recently by Sumitomo Chemicals using a RuO2 catalyst supported on TiO2."
[2] "Importantly, the volcano curve can be based on just one descriptor, the dissociative oxygen chemisorption, which potentially allows for the fast computational screening for new catalysts."
[3] "It is found that the commonly employed RuO2 catalyst is close to optimal, but that there could still be room for improvements."
[4] "Our analysis also suggests that it would be possible to run the Deacon process with a reasonable TOF at reaction temperatures that are about 100K lower than those used for RuO2 catalysts, if one would be able to find an oxide material with the optimal catalytic properties."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy plays a crucial role in assessing the efficiency of the surface in promoting the desired chemical transformations. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, which is essential for the effective adsorption and activation of reactants on the surface.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一能量对于评估表面促进所需化学转变的效率至关重要。较低的ΔEv通常表明更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为它使氧空位的形成更容易，这对于表面有效吸附和活化反应物是必要的。
