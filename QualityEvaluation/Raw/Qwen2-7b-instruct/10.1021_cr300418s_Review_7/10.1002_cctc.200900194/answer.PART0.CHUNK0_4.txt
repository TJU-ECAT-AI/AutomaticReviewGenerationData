[1] "It is found that RuO2 catalysts are close to the top of the volcano curve, but that there is still room for improvements in the catalytic activity."
[2] "Linear energy relations for the elementary reaction steps are obtained from the DFT calculations and used to establish a one-dimensional descriptor for the catalytic activity."
[3] "Importantly, the volcano curve can be based on just one descriptor, the dissociative oxygen chemisorption, which potentially allows for the fast computational screening for new catalysts."
[4] "RuO2 catalysts are relatively expensive material, and replacing RuO2 with cheaper and more abundant materials is therefore highly desirable."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Catalysts with lower ΔEv values tend to exhibit higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to more efficient oxygen vacancy formation, which facilitates the reaction pathways and enhances the reaction rates. Replacing expensive catalysts like RuO2 with cheaper alternatives that maintain or improve the ΔEv values could lead to more cost-effective and efficient catalysts for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧化物的氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运作。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。具有较低ΔEv值的催化剂往往表现出更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它们能够更有效地形成氧空位，从而促进反应途径并提高反应速率。用便宜且更丰富的材料替代昂贵的催化剂，如RuO2，如果能够保持或改善ΔEv值，则可能导致成本效益更高、效率更高的催化剂用于氧化物催化氧化反应。
