[1] "It is found that the commonly employed RuO2 catalyst is close to optimal, but that there could still be room for improvements."
[2] "The descriptor employed here is the dissociative chemisorption energy of oxygen."
[3] "RuO2 catalysts are close to the top of the volcano curve, but that there is still room for improvements in the catalytic activity."
[4] "The volcano curve can be based on just one descriptor, the dissociative oxygen chemisorption, which potentially allows for the fast computational screening for new catalysts."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (oxygen vacancies, ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) affects the stability of the oxide surface and its ability to facilitate the desired chemical reactions. Lower ΔEv indicates a more stable surface with a higher tendency to form oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the catalytic activity by providing additional reactive sites for the oxidation process. Consequently, the significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the balance between the stability of the oxide surface and its reactivity, thereby influencing the overall efficiency of the oxide catalyst in promoting the desired oxidation reactions.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（氧空位，ΔEv）来运作。这些氧空位在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成的能量需求（ΔEv）影响氧化物表面的稳定性及其促进所需化学反应的能力。较低的ΔEv表明一个更稳定的表面，有更高的倾向形成氧空位，这可以通过提供额外的活性位点来增强催化活性，从而促进氧化过程。因此，ΔEv的重要性在于其对氧化物表面稳定性和反应性之间的平衡的影响，从而影响氧化物催化剂的整体效率，促进所需氧化反应。
