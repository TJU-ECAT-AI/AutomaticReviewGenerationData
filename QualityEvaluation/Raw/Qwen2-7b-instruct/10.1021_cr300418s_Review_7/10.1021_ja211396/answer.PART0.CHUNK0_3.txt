The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction. ΔEv plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When the reaction proceeds, the formation of oxygen vacancies releases energy, which is harnessed to facilitate the oxidation process. The energy difference between the surface oxygen state and the bulk oxygen state (ΔEv) determines the ease with which oxygen can be removed from the surface, influencing the overall reaction rate and selectivity.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。ΔEv对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当反应进行时，氧空位的形成释放能量，该能量被用来促进氧化过程。表面氧状态与体相氧状态之间的能量差（ΔEv）决定了氧从表面除去的容易程度，从而影响整体反应速率和选择性。
