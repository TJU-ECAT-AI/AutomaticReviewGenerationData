          [1] "Our study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support."
          [2] "Inserting overvalent Mo species leads to the growth of 2D metal islands that are stabilized by an electron transfer from the impurity ions."
          [3] "Codoping with Li effectively blocks this charge exchange, as excess electrons are trapped by O 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These O vacancies play a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences the reactivity of the oxide surface towards reactants and products.

          [1] "Our work demonstrates how doping of an oxide material might be exploited to control the equilibrium shape of metal ad-particles."
          [2] "Gold develops 3D deposits, as expected from its weak interaction with the wide-gap insulator."
          [3] "Inserting 4% of Mo into the CaO matrix changes the particle shapes from 3D to 2D."
          [4] "Adding small amounts of Li to CaOMo strongly alters the observed growth behavior."
          [5] "The observed changes in the Au particle geometry on doped CaO films can be explained with charge-transfer processes between the dopants and the ad-metal."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction. ΔEv plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When the reaction proceeds, the formation of oxygen vacancies releases energy, which is harnessed to facilitate the oxidation process. The energy difference between the surface oxygen state and the bulk oxygen state (ΔEv) determines the ease with which oxygen can be removed from the surface, influencing the overall reaction rate and selectivity.

          Regular meditation can notably decrease stress levels. Participants who engaged in mindfulness meditation experienced a reduction in cortisol, a hormone linked to stress. This practice also led to improvements in mood and emotional well-being among the participants. These results imply that integrating meditation into daily activities could provide significant advantages for mental health.
