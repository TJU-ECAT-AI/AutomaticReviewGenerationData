[1] "Our study elucidates how shaping of metal ad-particles might be possible via doping the oxide support."
[2] "Codoping with Li effectively blocks this charge exchange, as excess electrons are trapped by O 2p-type holes created by the alkali dopants."
[3] "Consequently, charge-compensated Li+Mo3+ ion pairs develop that are unable to modify the Au growth behavior."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These O vacancies play a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences the reactivity of the oxide surface towards reactants and products. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, which can enhance the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. However, the exact relationship between ΔEv, catalytic activity, and oxidizing ability depends on the specific chemical conditions and the nature of the reactants involved in the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧空位（O空位）形成而起作用。这些O空位对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）很重要，因为它影响了氧化物表面对反应物和产物的反应性。较低的ΔEv表明更容易形成O空位，这可以增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。然而，ΔEv、催化活性和氧化能力之间的具体关系取决于所涉及氧化过程的特定化学条件和反应物的性质。
