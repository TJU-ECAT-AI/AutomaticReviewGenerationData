1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability, as it makes the formation of O vacancies more energetically favorable, enhancing the surface's reactivity towards oxidation reactions.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面氧空位（O空位）的形成来发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为它使O空位的形成更加有利可图，从而增强表面对氧化反应的反应性。
