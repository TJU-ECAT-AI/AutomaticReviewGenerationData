To address the systemic sensitizing potential of pharmaceuticals, additional drugs should undergo testing using a stepwise approach that includes RA-PLNA and oral exposure methods. This is crucial for assessing the hazard of systemic sensitization. An alternative hypothesis suggests that drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions might not require reactive intermediates, proposing the p-i concept. This concept posits that drugs could interact with immune receptors directly, non-covalently, and reversibly, stimulating cells similarly to pharmacological activation of other receptors, potentially without triggering an immune response to the drug itself.

为了评估药物的系统致敏潜力，需要对额外的药物进行测试，采用包括RA-PLNA和口服暴露在内的分步方法。这对于评估系统致敏的风险至关重要。提出了一种替代假说，即药物诱导的超敏反应可能不需要活性中间体。这一概念提出了p-i（药物与免疫受体的药理学相互作用）概念，认为药物可以直接、非共价、可逆地与免疫受体相互作用，刺激细胞类似于其他受体的药理激活，可能不会引发针对药物本身的免疫反应。
