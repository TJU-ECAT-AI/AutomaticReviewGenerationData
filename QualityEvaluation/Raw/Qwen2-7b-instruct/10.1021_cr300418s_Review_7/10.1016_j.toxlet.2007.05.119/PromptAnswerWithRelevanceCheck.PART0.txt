[1] "For DP, female C3H/HeOuJ mice received the RA TNP-OVA, i.p. on day 0 and 50,150 or 450 mg/kg by gavage on days 07."
[2] "Oral DF dosing also stimulated the antibody and DTH response to TNP-OVA, whereas NV only stimulated the DTH response."
[3] "This so called p-i concept (pharmacological interaction of drugs with immune receptors) implies a radical change of our thinking about drug hypersensitivity: drugs would not need to bind covalently to the MHCpeptide complex in order to trigger an immune response; rather, some drugs may bind directly, non-covalently and reversibly to immune receptors like some of the >1012 different T cell receptors (TCR), thereby stimulating the cells akin to a pharmacological activation of other receptors."
[4] "Recently we found that a certain level of TCR stimulation can occur even in the absence of antigen presenting cells, and that drugs may act on TCR like agonists, partial agonist or even antagonist."

Drug administration through oral routes, such as d-penicillamine (DP), diclofenac (DF), and Nevirapine (NV), can lead to systemic immune sensitization in mice. DP, at a dose of 450 mg/kg, and DF stimulated both antibody and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to TNP-OVA. In contrast, NV only stimulated the DTH response. The pharmacological interaction of drugs with immune receptors, particularly T cell receptors (TCR), plays a crucial role in drug hypersensitivity. This concept suggests that drugs can activate T cells without covalent binding to the MHC-peptide complex. Moreover, drugs might act as TCR agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists, even without the presence of antigen-presenting cells. These findings indicate that drug hypersensitivity might not solely depend on reactive intermediates but could involve direct interactions with immune receptors.

在口服给药途径下，如d-青霉胺（DP）、双氯芬酸（DF）和奈韦拉平（NV），可以在小鼠中诱导系统免疫敏感性。在450 mg/kg剂量下，DP和DF刺激了TNP-OVA的抗体和迟发型超敏反应（DTH）响应，而NV仅刺激了DTH响应。药物与免疫受体的药理学相互作用，特别是T细胞受体（TCR），在药物超敏反应中起着关键作用。这一概念表明，药物可能不需要与MHC肽复合物共价结合就能激活T细胞。此外，即使没有抗原呈递细胞，药物也可能以激动剂、部分激动剂或拮抗剂的形式作用于TCR。这些发现表明，药物超敏反应可能不仅仅依赖于活性中间体，而是可能涉及与免疫受体的直接相互作用。

[2] "Drug allergy does not need to involve reactive intermediates: An alternative hypothesis"
[3] "The p-i concept is based on the in vitro analysis of drug specific T cell clones and of mouse hybridoma cells into which drug specific TCR were transfected."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
To address the systemic sensitizing potential of pharmaceuticals, additional drugs should undergo testing using a stepwise approach that includes RA-PLNA and oral exposure methods. This is crucial for assessing the hazard of systemic sensitization. An alternative hypothesis suggests that drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions might not require reactive intermediates, proposing the p-i concept. This concept posits that drugs could interact with immune receptors directly, non-covalently, and reversibly, stimulating cells similarly to pharmacological activation of other receptors, potentially without triggering an immune response to the drug itself.

为了评估药物的系统致敏潜力，需要对额外的药物进行测试，采用包括RA-PLNA和口服暴露在内的分步方法。这对于评估系统致敏的风险至关重要。提出了一种替代假说，即药物诱导的超敏反应可能不需要活性中间体。这一概念提出了p-i（药物与免疫受体的药理学相互作用）概念，认为药物可以直接、非共价、可逆地与免疫受体相互作用，刺激细胞类似于其他受体的药理激活，可能不会引发针对药物本身的免疫反应。
