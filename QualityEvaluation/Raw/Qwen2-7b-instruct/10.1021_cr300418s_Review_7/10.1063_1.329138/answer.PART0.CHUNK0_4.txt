[1] "In the present paper, we have combined infrared and ESR data to obtain information about the formation and decay of the various aluminum centers in both swept and unswept high-quality synthetic quartz. By monitoring the absolute concentration of each type of compensated aluminum center (i.e., AI-OH -, AI-M + or [Ale' ]0) after each step of a series of irradiations and anneals, we have shown, within experimental error, that the sum of these centers remains constant, and that different treatments simply change one type of compensator for another. This direct accountability of all the aluminum ions within a crystal strongly suggests that the 3306- and 3367-cm- I infrared bands are associated with the AI-OH- center, and also reinforces the conviction that radiation-induced mobility of interstitial ions is the fun- damental radiation response of quartz."
[2] "The defect centers produced by local compensation of the substitutional aluminum ions can be experimentally ob- served by widely varying techniques. In the case of the AI- OH- center, the interstitial proton bonds to an oxygen ion to form an OH- molecule adjacent to the aluminum, and in- frared absorption provides a direct monitor of the center."
[3] "The [Ale+ ]0 center is perhaps the best characterized of the point defects in quartz. The first observations of this center were by ESR and were reported by Griffiths, Owen,and Ward. IS O'Brien immediately offered an interpreta- tion of the ESR data in terms of a model having a hole trapped primarily in a non bonding orbital of an oxygen ion adjacent to a substitutional aluminum ion [see Fig. l(c)].Mackey greatly expanded this early work by discovering a family of [Ale. / M + ] + centers when germanium-doped quartz was irradiated at 77 K."

The role of aluminum in quartz radiation response involves its need for charge compensation. The infrared absorption and ESR data reveal that substitutional aluminum ions in high-quality quartz can have interstitial hydrogen ions, radiation-induced holes, or interstitial alkali ions as compensators. The absolute concentration of aluminum ions in a specific compensator varies systematically and depends on the sample's treatment and whether it has been swept or not. As-received unswept samples primarily have AI-M+ centers, whereas as-received hydrogen-swept samples predominantly have AI-OH- centers. The AI-OH- center is associated with an OH- molecule adjacent to a substitutional aluminum, and the [Ale+ ]0 center is characterized by a hole trapped primarily in a non-bonding orbital of an oxygen ion next to the aluminum. Radiation-induced mobility of interstitial ions is considered the fundamental radiation response of quartz, and the 3306- and 3367-cm-1 infrared bands are linked to the AI-OH- center.

The [Ale+ ]0 center is characterized by a hole trapped primarily in a non-bonding orbital of an oxygen ion adjacent to a substitutional aluminum ion. This center is well characterized in quartz, with the first observations made by ESR and reported by Griffiths, Owen, and Ward. O'Brien offered an interpretation of the ESR data in terms of a model where a hole is trapped primarily in a non-bonding orbital of an oxygen ion next to the aluminum. Mackey expanded this early work by discovering a family of [Ale. / M + ] + centers when germanium-doped quartz was irradiated at 77 K.

在石英辐射响应中的铝的作用涉及其需要电荷补偿。红外吸收和电子自旋共振（ESR）数据表明，高质量石英中的取代铝离子可以具有间隙氢离子、辐射诱导的空穴或间隙碱金属离子作为补偿者。特定补偿者的铝离子绝对浓度系统地变化，并且取决于样本处理和是否已经扫过。未处理的原始未扫过的样本主要具有AI-M+中心，而原始处理的氢扫过的样本主要具有AI-OH-中心。AI-OH-中心与一个位于铝旁边的OH-分子相关联，以及[Ale+ ]0中心由一个孔主要被困在铝旁边的一个非共价轨道上的氧离子的模型描述。辐射诱导的间隙离子的移动被认为是石英的基本辐射响应，3306-和3367-cm-1红外带与AI-OH-中心相关联。

[Ale+ ]0中心由一个孔主要被困在铝旁边的一个非共价轨道上的氧离子的模型描述。这个中心在石英中被很好地描述，第一次观察是由ESR和由Griffiths、Owen和Ward报告的。O'Brien提供了对ESR数据的解释，认为一个孔主要被困在铝旁边的非共价轨道上的氧离子上。Mackey扩展了早期的工作，当锗掺杂的石英在77 K时被辐射时，发现了[Ale. / M + ] +中心的家庭。
