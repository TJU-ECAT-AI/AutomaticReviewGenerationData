[1] "In the present investigation, we did not monitor the AI- M +- centers directly, but inferred their presence from the absence of AI-OH- and [Ale' ]0 centers."
[2] "It is important to note that this is not a limitation of our results, since the recent acoustic loss measurements of Doherty et al.,28 where the AI-Na + centers were observed directly, strongly support our method of accounting for aluminum ions not found in the form of AI-OH- or [Ale' ]0 centers."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Radiation-induced holes or interstitial alkali ions are inferred to compensate for the substitutional aluminum ions in quartz due to the absence of AI-OH- and [Ale' ]0 centers. This inference supports the method of accounting for aluminum ions that are not in the form of AI-OH- or [Ale' ]0 centers.

[1] "The results from the present study stongly support the work of the earlier investigators and thus further verify the following description of the response of high-quality synthetic quartz to ionizing radiation."
[2] "At this low temperature, the interstitial alkali ion cannot be removed from the aluminum site and this, in turn, prevents hydrogen ions released by the radiation from being trapped at the aluminum site."
[3] "Irradiation of the un swept samples above 200 K gives quite different results, since there is then sufficient thermal energy available to allow the radiation-induced dissociation of the AI-M f centers."
[4] "As the interstitial alkali ions are re- moved from the aluminum sites, holes and interstitial hydro- gen ions are trapped by the aluminum to form [Ale' r cen- ters and AI-OH- centers, respectively."
[5] "In the case of hydrogen-swept quartz, the interstitial alkali ions have been replaced by interstitial hydrogen ions,and before irradiation, all of the aluminum is in the form of AI-OH-- centers."
[6] "Irradiation at 77 K dissociates the OH- molecules and allows the hydrogen to move away from the aluminum site."
[7] "Thus in hydrogen-swept samples, the steady-state concentration of [Ale' ]0 centers remaining after the room-temperature irradiation is signifi- cantly reduced from the value attained during irradiation,and it is also considerably less than the steady-state concen- tration produced by a 77-K irradiation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. At low temperatures, the interstitial alkali ion cannot be removed from the aluminum site, preventing hydrogen ions released by the radiation from being trapped at the aluminum site. Irradiation above 200 K allows for the radiation-induced dissociation of the AI-M f centers, leading to the removal of interstitial alkali ions from the aluminum sites. This results in the trapping of holes and interstitial hydrogen ions by the aluminum to form [Ale' r centers and AI-OH- centers, respectively. In hydrogen-swept quartz, all of the aluminum is initially in the form of AI-OH-- centers. Irradiation at 77 K dissociates the OH- molecules, allowing the hydrogen to move away from the aluminum site, forming hydrogen atoms and [Ale' ]0 centers. The concentration of [Ale' ]0 centers remaining after room-temperature irradiation is significantly reduced from the value attained during irradiation, and it is less than the concentration produced by a 77-K irradiation.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着关键作用。在低温下，间质碱离子无法从铝原子位置被移除，从而阻止了由辐射释放的氢离子被锁定在铝原子位置。在200 K以上的辐射照射下，允许辐射诱导的铝-氟键解离，导致从铝原子位置移除间质碱离子。这导致孔和间质氢离子被铝捕获形成[Ale' r中心]和AI-OH-中心。在氢处理过的石英中，所有铝最初都以AI-OH--中心形式存在。在77 K的辐射照射下，OH-分子被分解，允许氢从铝位置移动，形成氢原子和[Ale' ]0中心。在室温照射后剩余的[Ale' ]0中心浓度显著低于达到的值，并且小于77 K照射产生的浓度。

[1] "In the present paper, we have combined infrared and ESR data to obtain information about the formation and decay of the various aluminum centers in both swept and unswept high-quality synthetic quartz. By monitoring the absolute concentration of each type of compensated aluminum center (i.e., AI-OH -, AI-M + or [Ale' ]0) after each step of a series of irradiations and anneals, we have shown, within experimental error, that the sum of these centers remains constant, and that different treatments simply change one type of compensator for another. This direct accountability of all the aluminum ions within a crystal strongly suggests that the 3306- and 3367-cm- I infrared bands are associated with the AI-OH- center, and also reinforces the conviction that radiation-induced mobility of interstitial ions is the fun- damental radiation response of quartz."
[2] "The defect centers produced by local compensation of the substitutional aluminum ions can be experimentally ob- served by widely varying techniques. In the case of the AI- OH- center, the interstitial proton bonds to an oxygen ion to form an OH- molecule adjacent to the aluminum, and in- frared absorption provides a direct monitor of the center."
[3] "The [Ale+ ]0 center is perhaps the best characterized of the point defects in quartz. The first observations of this center were by ESR and were reported by Griffiths, Owen,and Ward. IS O'Brien immediately offered an interpreta- tion of the ESR data in terms of a model having a hole trapped primarily in a non bonding orbital of an oxygen ion adjacent to a substitutional aluminum ion [see Fig. l(c)].Mackey greatly expanded this early work by discovering a family of [Ale. / M + ] + centers when germanium-doped quartz was irradiated at 77 K."

The role of aluminum in quartz radiation response involves its need for charge compensation. The infrared absorption and ESR data reveal that substitutional aluminum ions in high-quality quartz can have interstitial hydrogen ions, radiation-induced holes, or interstitial alkali ions as compensators. The absolute concentration of aluminum ions in a specific compensator varies systematically and depends on the sample's treatment and whether it has been swept or not. As-received unswept samples primarily have AI-M+ centers, whereas as-received hydrogen-swept samples predominantly have AI-OH- centers. The AI-OH- center is associated with an OH- molecule adjacent to a substitutional aluminum, and the [Ale+ ]0 center is characterized by a hole trapped primarily in a non-bonding orbital of an oxygen ion next to the aluminum. Radiation-induced mobility of interstitial ions is considered the fundamental radiation response of quartz, and the 3306- and 3367-cm-1 infrared bands are linked to the AI-OH- center.

The [Ale+ ]0 center is characterized by a hole trapped primarily in a non-bonding orbital of an oxygen ion adjacent to a substitutional aluminum ion. This center is well characterized in quartz, with the first observations made by ESR and reported by Griffiths, Owen, and Ward. O'Brien offered an interpretation of the ESR data in terms of a model where a hole is trapped primarily in a non-bonding orbital of an oxygen ion next to the aluminum. Mackey expanded this early work by discovering a family of [Ale. / M + ] + centers when germanium-doped quartz was irradiated at 77 K.

在石英辐射响应中的铝的作用涉及其需要电荷补偿。红外吸收和电子自旋共振（ESR）数据表明，高质量石英中的取代铝离子可以具有间隙氢离子、辐射诱导的空穴或间隙碱金属离子作为补偿者。特定补偿者的铝离子绝对浓度系统地变化，并且取决于样本处理和是否已经扫过。未处理的原始未扫过的样本主要具有AI-M+中心，而原始处理的氢扫过的样本主要具有AI-OH-中心。AI-OH-中心与一个位于铝旁边的OH-分子相关联，以及[Ale+ ]0中心由一个孔主要被困在铝旁边的一个非共价轨道上的氧离子的模型描述。辐射诱导的间隙离子的移动被认为是石英的基本辐射响应，3306-和3367-cm-1红外带与AI-OH-中心相关联。

[Ale+ ]0中心由一个孔主要被困在铝旁边的一个非共价轨道上的氧离子的模型描述。这个中心在石英中被很好地描述，第一次观察是由ESR和由Griffiths、Owen和Ward报告的。O'Brien提供了对ESR数据的解释，认为一个孔主要被困在铝旁边的非共价轨道上的氧离子上。Mackey扩展了早期的工作，当锗掺杂的石英在77 K时被辐射时，发现了[Ale. / M + ] +中心的家庭。
