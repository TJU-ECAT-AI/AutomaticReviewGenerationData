[1] "The results from the present study stongly support the work of the earlier investigators and thus further verify the following description of the response of high-quality synthetic quartz to ionizing radiation."
[2] "At this low temperature, the interstitial alkali ion cannot be removed from the aluminum site and this, in turn, prevents hydrogen ions released by the radiation from being trapped at the aluminum site."
[3] "Irradiation of the un swept samples above 200 K gives quite different results, since there is then sufficient thermal energy available to allow the radiation-induced dissociation of the AI-M f centers."
[4] "As the interstitial alkali ions are re- moved from the aluminum sites, holes and interstitial hydro- gen ions are trapped by the aluminum to form [Ale' r cen- ters and AI-OH- centers, respectively."
[5] "In the case of hydrogen-swept quartz, the interstitial alkali ions have been replaced by interstitial hydrogen ions,and before irradiation, all of the aluminum is in the form of AI-OH-- centers."
[6] "Irradiation at 77 K dissociates the OH- molecules and allows the hydrogen to move away from the aluminum site."
[7] "Thus in hydrogen-swept samples, the steady-state concentration of [Ale' ]0 centers remaining after the room-temperature irradiation is signifi- cantly reduced from the value attained during irradiation,and it is also considerably less than the steady-state concen- tration produced by a 77-K irradiation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. At low temperatures, the interstitial alkali ion cannot be removed from the aluminum site, preventing hydrogen ions released by the radiation from being trapped at the aluminum site. Irradiation above 200 K allows for the radiation-induced dissociation of the AI-M f centers, leading to the removal of interstitial alkali ions from the aluminum sites. This results in the trapping of holes and interstitial hydrogen ions by the aluminum to form [Ale' r centers and AI-OH- centers, respectively. In hydrogen-swept quartz, all of the aluminum is initially in the form of AI-OH-- centers. Irradiation at 77 K dissociates the OH- molecules, allowing the hydrogen to move away from the aluminum site, forming hydrogen atoms and [Ale' ]0 centers. The concentration of [Ale' ]0 centers remaining after room-temperature irradiation is significantly reduced from the value attained during irradiation, and it is less than the concentration produced by a 77-K irradiation.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着关键作用。在低温下，间质碱离子无法从铝原子位置被移除，从而阻止了由辐射释放的氢离子被锁定在铝原子位置。在200 K以上的辐射照射下，允许辐射诱导的铝-氟键解离，导致从铝原子位置移除间质碱离子。这导致孔和间质氢离子被铝捕获形成[Ale' r中心]和AI-OH-中心。在氢处理过的石英中，所有铝最初都以AI-OH--中心形式存在。在77 K的辐射照射下，OH-分子被分解，允许氢从铝位置移动，形成氢原子和[Ale' ]0中心。在室温照射后剩余的[Ale' ]0中心浓度显著低于达到的值，并且小于77 K照射产生的浓度。
