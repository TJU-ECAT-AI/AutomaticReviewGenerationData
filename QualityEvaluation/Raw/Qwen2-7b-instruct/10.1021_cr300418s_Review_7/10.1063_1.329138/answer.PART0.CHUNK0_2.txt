[1] "In the present investigation, we did not monitor the AI- M +- centers directly, but inferred their presence from the absence of AI-OH- and [Ale' ]0 centers."
[2] "It is important to note that this is not a limitation of our results, since the recent acoustic loss measurements of Doherty et al.,28 where the AI-Na + centers were observed directly, strongly support our method of accounting for aluminum ions not found in the form of AI-OH- or [Ale' ]0 centers."

Radiation-induced holes or interstitial alkali ions are inferred to compensate for the substitutional aluminum ions in quartz due to the absence of AI-OH- and [Ale' ]0 centers. This inference supports the method of accounting for aluminum ions that are not in the form of AI-OH- or [Ale' ]0 centers.

由于缺乏AI-OH-和[Ale' ]0中心，通过推断存在辐射诱导的空穴或间隙碱离子来补偿硅酸盐中的铝离子。这种方法支持了对未以AI-OH-或[Ale' ]0形式存在的铝离子进行计数。
