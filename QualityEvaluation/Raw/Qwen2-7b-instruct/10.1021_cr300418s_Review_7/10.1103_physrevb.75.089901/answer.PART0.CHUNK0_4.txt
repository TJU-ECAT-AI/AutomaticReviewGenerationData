1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of reactants, the formation of an intermediate species, and the subsequent reaction leading to product formation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile process for oxygen vacancy creation, potentially enhancing the catalyst's performance and reactivity.
