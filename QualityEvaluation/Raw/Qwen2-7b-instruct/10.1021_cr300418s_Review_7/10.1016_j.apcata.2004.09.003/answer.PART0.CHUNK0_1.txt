[1] "The oxidation of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane has been studied over CeO2 and Samaria-doped ceria (SDC) catalysts."
[2] "The rates for methane and ethane were found to be indistinguishable over the two catalysts, while the rates for propane and n-butane were much higher on ceria compared to SDC."
[3] "Measurements using CD4 and C4D10 show that both low- and high-temperature rates exhibit a similar kinetic-isotope effect; however, the low-temperature process is half-order in O2, while the high-temperature process is zero-order."
[4] "Pulse studies demonstrate that oxygen from the bulk becomes accessible for reaction at approximately the same temperature as that at which the high-temperature rate process becomes important."
[5] "The half-order reaction in O2 for n-butane oxidation at low temperatures on ceria suggests that this rate process involves dissociatively adsorbed oxygen."
[6] "Oxidation rates for methane and ethane over ceria and SDC are similar because Sm-doping poisons only the low-temperature process."
[7] "Assuming our interpretation is correct, it is noteworthy that oxygen exchange between the surface and the bulk of ceria begins at approximately 650 K."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide. This vacancy is crucial as it determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. The mechanism involves the adsorption of a reactant molecule, followed by its oxidation, and finally, the release of the product molecule. The presence of ΔEv facilitates the movement of electrons and oxygen atoms, thus enhancing the reaction rate and efficiency.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the surface reactivity of the oxide. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more active surface, capable of faster reactions, whereas a higher ΔEv suggests a less reactive surface. This energy barrier is influenced by factors such as the oxide's structure, composition, and temperature. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism highlights the importance of controlling ΔEv to optimize the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces in various oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。这个空位对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。ΔEv的能量要求在催化活性和氧化能力上具有重要意义。该机制涉及吸附反应分子，随后对其进行氧化，最后释放产物分子。ΔEv的存在有助于电子和氧原子的移动，从而提高反应速率和效率。

ΔEv的显著意义在于其对氧化物表面反应性的影响。较低的ΔEv通常表示活性较高的表面，能够更快地进行反应，而较高的ΔEv则表示活性较低的表面。ΔEv的能量壁垒受氧化物结构、组成和温度等因素的影响。火星-克雷韦伦机制强调控制ΔEv以优化氧化物表面在各种氧化反应中的催化性能的重要性。
