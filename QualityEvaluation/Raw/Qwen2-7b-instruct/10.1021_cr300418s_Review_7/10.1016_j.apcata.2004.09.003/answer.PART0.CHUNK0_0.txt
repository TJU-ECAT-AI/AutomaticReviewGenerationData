[1] "While it is often suggested that doping ceria should increase its activity for oxidation chemistry, recent studies from our laboratory have found that many dopants to CeO2, including Yb2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3, Gd2O3, La2O3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, or Pr6O11, significantly decrease the catalytic activity for butane oxidation."
[2] "We chose Sm doping for this study because, among rare-earth dopants, Sm causes the largest increase in ionic conductivity in ceria [8] and also causes the biggest decrease in activity for n-butane oxidation [14]."
[3] "The results indicate that a common assumption, that doping ceria should increase its reactivity, is not generally correct."
[4] "Also, the assumption that a catalyst which exhibits higher activity for one oxidation reaction will also show higher reactivities for other hydrocarbon reactions is not always valid."

1. Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that many dopants, such as Yb2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3, Gd2O3, La2O3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, or Pr6O11, significantly reduce the catalytic activity for butane oxidation on ceria. 
2. We selected Sm doping for this investigation because among rare-earth dopants, Sm increases ionic conductivity in ceria the most and results in the greatest decrease in n-butane oxidation activity.
3. Our findings suggest that the widely held assumption that doping ceria will increase its reactivity is not universally true.
4. It's also not always accurate to assume that a catalyst with higher activity for one oxidation reaction will perform similarly for other hydrocarbon reactions.

1. 我们实验室最近的研究表明，许多掺杂剂，如Yb2O3、Y2O3、Sm2O3、Gd2O3、La2O3、Nb2O5、Ta2O5或Pr6O11，显著降低了但烷氧化在铈氧化物上的催化活性。
2. 我们选择用Sm掺杂是因为在稀土掺杂剂中，Sm在铈中增加离子导电性的效果最大，并且导致了最大的n-但烷氧化活性降低。
3. 我们的发现表明，广泛持有的假设，即掺杂铈会增加其反应性，通常并不正确。
4. 也不是总是准确地假设一个催化剂在一种氧化反应中的活性较高，对于其他碳氢化合物反应也会表现出相似的活性。
