[1] "While it is often suggested that doping ceria should increase its activity for oxidation chemistry, recent studies from our laboratory have found that many dopants to CeO2, including Yb2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3, Gd2O3, La2O3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, or Pr6O11, significantly decrease the catalytic activity for butane oxidation."
[2] "We chose Sm doping for this study because, among rare-earth dopants, Sm causes the largest increase in ionic conductivity in ceria [8] and also causes the biggest decrease in activity for n-butane oxidation [14]."
[3] "The results indicate that a common assumption, that doping ceria should increase its reactivity, is not generally correct."
[4] "Also, the assumption that a catalyst which exhibits higher activity for one oxidation reaction will also show higher reactivities for other hydrocarbon reactions is not always valid."

1. Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that many dopants, such as Yb2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3, Gd2O3, La2O3, Nb2O5, Ta2O5, or Pr6O11, significantly reduce the catalytic activity for butane oxidation on ceria. 
2. We selected Sm doping for this investigation because among rare-earth dopants, Sm increases ionic conductivity in ceria the most and results in the greatest decrease in n-butane oxidation activity.
3. Our findings suggest that the widely held assumption that doping ceria will increase its reactivity is not universally true.
4. It's also not always accurate to assume that a catalyst with higher activity for one oxidation reaction will perform similarly for other hydrocarbon reactions.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
1. 我们实验室最近的研究表明，许多掺杂剂，如Yb2O3、Y2O3、Sm2O3、Gd2O3、La2O3、Nb2O5、Ta2O5或Pr6O11，显著降低了但烷氧化在铈氧化物上的催化活性。
2. 我们选择用Sm掺杂是因为在稀土掺杂剂中，Sm在铈中增加离子导电性的效果最大，并且导致了最大的n-但烷氧化活性降低。
3. 我们的发现表明，广泛持有的假设，即掺杂铈会增加其反应性，通常并不正确。
4. 也不是总是准确地假设一个催化剂在一种氧化反应中的活性较高，对于其他碳氢化合物反应也会表现出相似的活性。

[1] "The oxidation of methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane has been studied over CeO2 and Samaria-doped ceria (SDC) catalysts."
[2] "The rates for methane and ethane were found to be indistinguishable over the two catalysts, while the rates for propane and n-butane were much higher on ceria compared to SDC."
[3] "Measurements using CD4 and C4D10 show that both low- and high-temperature rates exhibit a similar kinetic-isotope effect; however, the low-temperature process is half-order in O2, while the high-temperature process is zero-order."
[4] "Pulse studies demonstrate that oxygen from the bulk becomes accessible for reaction at approximately the same temperature as that at which the high-temperature rate process becomes important."
[5] "The half-order reaction in O2 for n-butane oxidation at low temperatures on ceria suggests that this rate process involves dissociatively adsorbed oxygen."
[6] "Oxidation rates for methane and ethane over ceria and SDC are similar because Sm-doping poisons only the low-temperature process."
[7] "Assuming our interpretation is correct, it is noteworthy that oxygen exchange between the surface and the bulk of ceria begins at approximately 650 K."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) on the surface of the oxide. This vacancy is crucial as it determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. The mechanism involves the adsorption of a reactant molecule, followed by its oxidation, and finally, the release of the product molecule. The presence of ΔEv facilitates the movement of electrons and oxygen atoms, thus enhancing the reaction rate and efficiency.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the surface reactivity of the oxide. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more active surface, capable of faster reactions, whereas a higher ΔEv suggests a less reactive surface. This energy barrier is influenced by factors such as the oxide's structure, composition, and temperature. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism highlights the importance of controlling ΔEv to optimize the catalytic performance of oxide surfaces in various oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物形成氧空位（ΔEv）来运作。这个空位对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。ΔEv的能量要求在催化活性和氧化能力上具有重要意义。该机制涉及吸附反应分子，随后对其进行氧化，最后释放产物分子。ΔEv的存在有助于电子和氧原子的移动，从而提高反应速率和效率。

ΔEv的显著意义在于其对氧化物表面反应性的影响。较低的ΔEv通常表示活性较高的表面，能够更快地进行反应，而较高的ΔEv则表示活性较低的表面。ΔEv的能量壁垒受氧化物结构、组成和温度等因素的影响。火星-克雷韦伦机制强调控制ΔEv以优化氧化物表面在各种氧化反应中的催化性能的重要性。

[1] "In our previous paper [14], the oxidation rates for n- butane were shown to be significantly lower on SDC compared to pure ceria. To determine whether this difference in activity depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon, we compared oxidation rates over the two catalysts for methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane, with the results shown in Fig. 1 and tabulated in Table 1."
[2] "As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the reaction rates over ceria and SDC were indistinguishable for both methane and ethane."
[3] "It is also noteworthy that the absolute rates and activation energies for methane and ethane are similar."
[4] "Over ceria, the oxidation rates for propane and n-butane were much higher than for methane and ethane."
[5] "The activation energies for oxidation of propane and n-butane were also lower than the activation energies for methane and ethane over both catalysts."
[6] "Given the differences in partial pressures and in the activation energies of the oxidation rates for the different hydrocarbons, the similarity may be circumstan- tial; however, the result is in sharp contrast to that observed for the ceria catalyst."
[7] "The fact that the low-temperature process on ceria is important for propane and n-butane, but not for methane and ethane, would suggest that methylene (CH2) groups,which are present in propane and n-butane but not in methane and ethane, are involved in that process."
[8] "Fig. 4a shows that the light-off curves for CD4 are shifted to higher temperatures by approximately 40 K compared to the curves for CH4 over both ceria and SDC,implying that the oxidation rates for CD4 are two to three times lower than those for CH4."
[9] "The analogous experiments with n-butane are shown in Fig. 4b. The entire light-off curve is again shifted to higher temperatures with C4D10 compared to C4H10 for both ceria and SDC catalysts; and, as with C4H10, the oxidation of C4D10 shows the two reaction regimes."
[10] "Therefore, CH bond scission is involved in the rate-limiting step for both regimes."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation and movement of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's ability to adsorb and oxidize reactants, thus increasing catalytic activity and oxidizing power. The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the reactivity of the oxide surface, with lower values leading to enhanced reactivity and efficiency in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.
