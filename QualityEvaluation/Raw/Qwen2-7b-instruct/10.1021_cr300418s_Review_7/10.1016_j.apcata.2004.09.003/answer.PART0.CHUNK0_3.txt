[1] "Over ceria, the oxidation rates for propane and n-butane were much higher than for methane and ethane."
[2] "The difference between n-butane oxidation over ceria and SDC is shown to result from a low-temperature rate process on ceria that is not present on SDC."
[3] "Measurements using CD4 and C4D10 show that both low- and high-temperature rates exhibit a similar kinetic-isotope effect; however, the low-temperature process is half-order in O2, while the high-temperature process is zero-order."
[4] "Pulse studies demonstrate that oxygen from the bulk becomes accessible for reaction at approximately the same temperature as that at which the high-temperature rate process becomes important."
[5] "The implication of these results for understanding the effect of doping on reactions over ceria, and for characterization of oxides using standard test reactions, are discussed."
[6] "Sm3+ doping of ceria affects oxidation of propane and n-butane dramatically while have no effect at all over methane and ethane oxidation."
[7] "The difference with reactants is due to the fact that there is a low-temperature rate process with n-butane oxidation over ceria, not observed with methane,that is removed by doping with Sm."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies a higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as it facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for the redox reactions occurring at the oxide surface. This mechanism explains how the surface chemistry and structure of the oxide influence its performance in oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它有利于更容易地形成氧空位，这对于在氧化物表面发生的还原反应至关重要。这一机制解释了氧化物的表面化学和结构如何影响其在氧化反应中的表现。
