[1] "In our previous paper [14], the oxidation rates for n- butane were shown to be significantly lower on SDC compared to pure ceria. To determine whether this difference in activity depends on the nature of the hydrocarbon, we compared oxidation rates over the two catalysts for methane, ethane, propane, and n-butane, with the results shown in Fig. 1 and tabulated in Table 1."
[2] "As shown in Fig. 1a and b, the reaction rates over ceria and SDC were indistinguishable for both methane and ethane."
[3] "It is also noteworthy that the absolute rates and activation energies for methane and ethane are similar."
[4] "Over ceria, the oxidation rates for propane and n-butane were much higher than for methane and ethane."
[5] "The activation energies for oxidation of propane and n-butane were also lower than the activation energies for methane and ethane over both catalysts."
[6] "Given the differences in partial pressures and in the activation energies of the oxidation rates for the different hydrocarbons, the similarity may be circumstan- tial; however, the result is in sharp contrast to that observed for the ceria catalyst."
[7] "The fact that the low-temperature process on ceria is important for propane and n-butane, but not for methane and ethane, would suggest that methylene (CH2) groups,which are present in propane and n-butane but not in methane and ethane, are involved in that process."
[8] "Fig. 4a shows that the light-off curves for CD4 are shifted to higher temperatures by approximately 40 K compared to the curves for CH4 over both ceria and SDC,implying that the oxidation rates for CD4 are two to three times lower than those for CH4."
[9] "The analogous experiments with n-butane are shown in Fig. 4b. The entire light-off curve is again shifted to higher temperatures with C4D10 compared to C4H10 for both ceria and SDC catalysts; and, as with C4H10, the oxidation of C4D10 shows the two reaction regimes."
[10] "Therefore, CH bond scission is involved in the rate-limiting step for both regimes."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation and movement of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the surface's ability to adsorb and oxidize reactants, thus increasing catalytic activity and oxidizing power. The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the reactivity of the oxide surface, with lower values leading to enhanced reactivity and efficiency in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷维尔机制通过在氧化物表面形成和移动氧空位来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。较低的ΔEv值有助于更容易地形成氧空位，从而增强表面吸附和氧化反应物的能力，进而提高催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv的重要性在于其对氧化物表面反应性的影响，较低的值导致反应性增强和效率提高。
