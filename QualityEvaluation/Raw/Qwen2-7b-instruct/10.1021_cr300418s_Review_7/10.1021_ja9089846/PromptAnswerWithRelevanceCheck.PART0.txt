<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen vacancies play a crucial role. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy barrier affects how easily oxygen atoms can be adsorbed, desorbed, or transferred across the surface, thus impacting the reaction rate and efficiency.
