[1] "Inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst as an alternative to classical direct configurations for preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich stream."
[2] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide."
[3] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
