[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of an adsorbed intermediate, typically a hydrocarbon molecule, which is oxidized by an oxygen atom from the oxide surface."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
