[1] "Inverse CeO2/CuO catalyst as an alternative to classical direct configurations for preferential oxidation of CO in hydrogen-rich stream."
[2] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through a series of steps involving the adsorption of reactants, their activation on the surface, and the subsequent reaction leading to product formation."
[3] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
