[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the sequential steps of oxygen adsorption, reaction with the reactant, and subsequent desorption."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the orderly stages of oxygen adsorption, interaction with the reactant, and release. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy creation (ΔEv) profoundly affects both the catalyst's activity and its oxidizing capability.
