[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support."
[2] "The crystalline phase obtained by the solgel method depends on the starting metallic precursor."
[3] "It was found that the ZrO2 monoclinic phase is favored at 800 C when using a La-Mn doping combination, while the tetragonal structure was promoted by a La-Fe doping mixture."
[4] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
[5] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

1. The solgel method is used for preparing metallic catalysts because it mixes components at an atomic level, resulting in a uniform distribution of active metals on the support.
2. The crystalline phase obtained through the solgel method is influenced by the starting metallic precursor.
3. A La-Mn doping combination favors the formation of the ZrO2 monoclinic phase at 800°C, while a La-Fe combination promotes the tetragonal structure.
4. Despite having low specific areas, the porous structure of ZrO2 catalysts facilitates the transport of reactants and products, thanks to their relatively large cavity sizes.
5. The La-Fe doped zirconia catalyst shows the best performance in the catalytic test for trichloroethylene combustion due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase.
