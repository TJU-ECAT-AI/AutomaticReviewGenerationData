[1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
[2] "The presence of tetragonal and monoclinic crystalline phases for the different doped samples depends on the combination of metals; it is clear that the monoclinic structure is favored by the La-Mn combination while the tetragonal arrangement by the La-Fe doping agents."
[3] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
[4] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

1. The solgel method is preferred for creating metallic catalysts because it mixes components at the atomic level, resulting in a consistent distribution of active metals across the support surface.
2. The crystalline phases of the doped samples, including tetragonal and monoclinic structures, are influenced by the type of metals used. The La-Mn combination favors the monoclinic structure, whereas La-Fe doping leads to a tetragonal arrangement.
3. Although the catalysts exhibit low surface areas, their large pore sizes enable efficient transportation of trichloroethylene and combustion products through the porous ZrO2 structure during catalytic tests.
4. The La-Fe doped zirconia catalyst performs exceptionally well in the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene, thanks to its dominant tetragonal zirconia phase that resists high concentration flows.

1. 溶胶凝胶法因其能将组分在原子尺度混合，并由此在支撑物上产生均匀的活性金属分布，受到了制备金属催化剂的极大关注。
2. 不同掺杂样品中的晶体相态（包括四方相和单斜相）取决于所使用的金属类型。镧锰组合倾向于促进单斜结构，而镧铁掺杂导致四方排列。
3. 尽管催化剂具有较低的表面积，但它们较大的孔隙大小能够通过多孔ZrO2结构有效地运输三氯乙烯及其燃烧产物，在催化测试中。
4. 镧铁掺杂的锆酸盐催化剂在三氯乙烯的催化燃烧测试中表现出色，这归功于其主导的四方锆酸盐相，该相能够抵抗高浓度流体。
