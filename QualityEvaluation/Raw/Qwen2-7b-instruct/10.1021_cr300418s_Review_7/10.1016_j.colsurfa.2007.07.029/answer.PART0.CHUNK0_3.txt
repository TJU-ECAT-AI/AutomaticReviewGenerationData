[1] "Zirconia is one of the most studied ceramic materials due to its outstanding thermal, mechanical and chemical stability; in addition, acidic, basic, oxidizing and reducing surface proper- ties make this oxide suitable for many catalytic processes [13]."
[2] "Depending on the preparation method and thermal treatment,monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic, or a mixture of these phases can be obtained."
[3] "Zirconia (Z) pure does not present catalytic activity at 200 C, ZLF and ZL catalysts show 10% of conversion, while the ZLMF and ZLM materials present 28% activity."
[4] "Only the catalyst doped with La and Fe continues with an excellent catalytic performance at high temperatures."

1. Zirconia is a highly researched ceramic material known for its exceptional thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, along with its ability to exhibit acidic, basic, oxidizing, and reducing surface properties, making it suitable for various catalytic processes.

2. The phase of zirconia, whether monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic, or a mixture of these, is dependent on the preparation method and thermal treatment applied.

3. Pure zirconia (Z) does not display catalytic activity at 200°C, while catalysts containing La, Mn, and Fe show a higher conversion rate. Specifically, ZLF and ZL catalysts exhibit a 10% conversion rate, whereas ZLMF and ZLM catalysts achieve a 28% conversion rate.

4. Among the catalysts, only the one doped with La and Fe maintains superior catalytic performance even at high temperatures.

1. 钛酸锆是一种因其出色的热、机械和化学稳定性而受到高度研究的陶瓷材料，此外，它还具有酸性、碱性、氧化性和还原性表面性质，使其适合多种催化过程。

2. 硅锆的相态，无论是单斜晶系、四方晶系、立方晶系还是这些相态的混合物，取决于其制备方法和热处理过程。

3. 纯钛酸锆（Z）在200°C下不显示催化活性，而含镧、锰和铁的催化剂显示出更高的转化率。具体而言，ZLF和ZL催化剂的转化率为10%，而ZLMF和ZLM催化剂的转化率为28%。

4. 在所有催化剂中，仅掺杂镧和铁的催化剂保持了在高温下的优越催化性能。
