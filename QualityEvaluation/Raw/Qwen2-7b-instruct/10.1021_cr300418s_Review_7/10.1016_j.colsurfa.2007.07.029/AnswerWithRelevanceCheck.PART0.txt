          [1] "The solgel method has attracted considerable attention for the preparation of metallic catalysts, since the constituents are mixed in an atomic scale and this generates a uniform distribution of active metals upon the support [8]."
          [2] "The presence of tetragonal and monoclinic crystalline phases for the different doped samples depends on the combination of metals; it is clear that the monoclinic structure is favored by the La-Mn combination while the tetragonal arrangement by the La-Fe doping agents."
          [3] "The textural analysis of the catalysts let to see the low specific areas for all samples, however, the relatively large cavity sizes could facilitate the transport of trichloroethylene and products combustion through the porous structure of ZrO2 at the catalytic tests."
          [4] "The La-Fe doped zirconia resisted the high concentration of trichloroethylene flow and developed the best performance of all catalysts in the corresponding catalytic test due to the presence of the dominant tetragonal zirconia phase."

          The solgel method is used for preparing metallic catalysts due to the uniform distribution of active metals across the support surface. The crystalline phase of the doped samples, including tetragonal and monoclinic structures, is influenced by the metal combination. Low specific areas in the catalysts indicate large cavities, facilitating the transport of reactants and products through the porous structure of ZrO2 during catalytic tests. The La-Fe doped zirconia catalyst performs best in the catalytic combustion of trichloroethylene, attributed to its dominant tetragonal zirconia phase.

          热溶胶法用于制备金属催化剂，因为可以在支撑物表面产生均匀的活性金属分布。掺杂样品的晶体相，包括四方相和单斜相，受金属组合的影响。催化剂的低特定面积表明存在较大的空腔，这有助于在ZrO2的多孔结构中通过催化测试期间的反应物和产物传输。镧铁掺杂的锆酸盐催化剂在三氯乙烯的催化燃烧测试中表现最好，归因于其主导的四方锆酸盐相。

          [1] "Zirconia is one of the most studied ceramic materials due to its outstanding thermal, mechanical and chemical stability; in addition, acidic, basic, oxidizing and reducing surface proper- ties make this oxide suitable for many catalytic processes [13]."
          [2] "Depending on the preparation method and thermal treatment,monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic, or a mixture of these phases can be obtained."
          [3] "Zirconia (Z) pure does not present catalytic activity at 200 C, ZLF and ZL catalysts show 10% of conversion, while the ZLMF and ZLM materials present 28% activity."
          [4] "Only the catalyst doped with La and Fe continues with an excellent catalytic performance at high temperatures."

          Zirconia is a highly researched ceramic material due to its exceptional thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability, and its ability to exhibit various surface properties, making it suitable for numerous catalytic processes. Depending on the preparation method and thermal treatment, monoclinic, tetragonal, cubic, or a mixture of these phases can be obtained. Pure zirconia does not show catalytic activity at 200°C, but catalysts containing La, Mn, and Fe have a higher conversion rate. Only the catalyst doped with La and Fe maintains excellent catalytic performance at high temperatures.
