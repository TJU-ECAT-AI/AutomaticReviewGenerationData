An analysis of the mechanism and the assumptions incorporated into the derivation of the Marsvan Krevelen rate expression for heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions reveals a number of inconsistencies. The expression as derived is properly applicable only for a reaction involving molecular oxygen adsorbed on a single site; however, the model assumes that lattice O ions (or atoms) react with the substrate being oxidized. Furthermore, the steps describing the model are not elementary steps and, in addition, the competitive adsorption of intermediates and products is not considered. Consequently, the original derivation is incorrect and this rate expression must be viewed only as a mathematical data-fitting function.

The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism operates under the assumption that molecular oxygen adsorbs onto a single site on the catalyst surface. However, the model incorrectly assumes that lattice oxygen ions (or atoms) react with the substrate. Moreover, the mechanism does not account for the non-elementary nature of the steps involved, the lack of consideration for competitive adsorption of intermediates and products, and the inconsistency with the adsorption of molecular oxygen. As a result, the rate expression is viewed as a mathematical tool for fitting data rather than having physical relevance.

火星范克雷文机制在假设分子氧吸附到催化剂表面的一个位点下运行。然而，该模型错误地假设了晶格氧离子（或原子）与被氧化的物质反应。此外，该机制没有考虑到中间体和产物的竞争吸附，也没有考虑步骤的非基本性质。因此，速率表达式被视为用于拟合数据的数学工具，而不是具有物理意义。

Alternative Langmuir-Hinshelwood, Hougen-Watson-type catalytic sequences can typically provide similar, and sometimes identical, rate equations which can fit rate data better than, or at least as well as, the Marsvan Krevelen expression.

Alternative kinetic models, such as Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Hougen-Watson sequences, can usually offer rate equations that are similar or identical to the Marsvan Krevelen expression, often providing a better fit to rate data than the Marsvan Krevelen expression itself.

替代的动力学模型，如Langmuir-Hinshelwood和Hougen-Watson序列，通常可以提供类似于火星范克雷文表达式的速率方程，有时甚至完全相同，这些方程往往比火星范克雷文表达式更好地拟合速率数据。

The Marsvan Krevelen kinetic model for redox oxidation reactions on solid catalysts, as originally stated, is inconsistent and incorrect. Consequently, the rate expression derived from this model is inapplicable except for one particular situation involving the adsorption of O2 molecules on a single site; however, in this instance the model is still inconsistent because O ions (or atoms) are proposed as the reactive oxygen species rather than adsorbed O2 molecules.

The original Marsvan Krevelen kinetic model for redox oxidation reactions on solid catalysts is flawed and incorrect. The derived rate expression is only applicable in a specific scenario where oxygen molecules adsorb onto a single site, yet even then, the model is inconsistent since it suggests reactive oxygen species as ions or atoms rather than adsorbed oxygen molecules.

火星范克雷文红氧化还原氧化反应在固体催化剂上的动力学模型，最初表述，是不一致且不正确的。从这个模型得出的速率表达式只适用于一个特定情况，即氧气分子吸附在一个单一的位点上；然而，在这种情况下，模型仍然不一致，因为它将反应性氧物种描述为离子或原子，而不是吸附的氧分子。
