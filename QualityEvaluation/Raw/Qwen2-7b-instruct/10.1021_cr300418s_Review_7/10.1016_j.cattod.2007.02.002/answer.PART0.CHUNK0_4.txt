Answer: The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions assumes that molecular oxygen adsorbs on a single site and reacts with the substrate being oxidized. However, the model incorrectly assumes that lattice O ions or atoms are involved in the reaction. The steps described in the model are not elementary, and the competitive adsorption of intermediates and products is not considered. Therefore, the Marsvan Krevelen rate expression is inconsistent and must be viewed as a mathematical data-fitting function rather than having physical relevance. Other models, such as Langmuir-Hinshelwood or Hougen-Watson sequences, can provide similar or identical rate equations that fit rate data better than the Marsvan Krevelen expression.

火星范克雷文机制在氧化反应中假设分子氧吸附在一个单点上并与被氧化的基质反应。然而，该模型错误地假设晶格O离子或原子参与反应。模型描述的步骤不是基本步骤，并且没有考虑中间体和产物的竞争吸附。因此，火星范克雷文速率表达式不一致，只能被视为数据拟合函数，而不是具有物理意义。其他模型，如兰姆-希尔伍德或豪根-沃森序列，可以提供相似或完全相同的速率方程，这些方程比火星范克雷文表达式更好地拟合速率数据。
