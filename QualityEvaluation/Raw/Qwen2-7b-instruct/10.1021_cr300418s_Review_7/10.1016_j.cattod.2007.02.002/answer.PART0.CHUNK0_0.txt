An analysis of the mechanism and the assumptions incorporated into the derivation of the Marsvan Krevelen rate expression for heterogeneously catalyzed oxidation reactions reveals a number of inconsistencies. The expression as derived is properly applicable only for a reaction involving molecular oxygen adsorbed on a single site; however, the model assumes that lattice O ions (or atoms) react with the substrate being oxidized. Furthermore, the steps describing the model are not elementary steps and, in addition, the competitive adsorption of intermediates and products is not considered. Consequently, the original derivation is incorrect and this rate expression must be viewed only as a mathematical data-fitting function.

The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism operates by assuming that molecular oxygen adsorbs onto a single site on the oxide surface and reacts with the substrate. However, the model incorrectly assumes that lattice oxygen ions participate in the reaction instead of molecular oxygen. Moreover, the mechanism does not account for non-elementary steps, competitive adsorption of intermediates and products, and the fact that molecular oxygen adsorbs on a single site rather than lattice oxygen ions.

马斯万克雷文机制通过假设分子氧吸附到氧化物表面的一个单点并与底物反应来运行。然而，该模型错误地假设晶格氧离子参与反应，而不是分子氧。此外，该机制没有考虑到非基本步骤、中间体和产物的竞争吸附以及分子氧仅吸附在单个站点上而非晶格氧离子的事实。

Alternative Langmuir-Hinshelwood, Hougen-Watson-type catalytic sequences can typically provide similar, and sometimes identical, rate equations which can fit rate data better than, or at least as well as, the Marsvan Krevelen expression. These latter models also provide rate parameters that can be evaluated for thermodynamic consistency.

Alternative models such as Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Hougen-Watson-type catalytic sequences often yield rate equations that are comparable or identical to the Marsvan Krevelen expression. These equations can better fit rate data or match the Marsvan Krevelen expression's performance. Additionally, the parameters derived from these models can be assessed for thermodynamic consistency.

替代模型，如兰格缪尔-亨谢尔伍德和豪根-沃森类型的催化序列，通常提供与马斯万克雷文表达式相似或完全相同的速率方程。这些方程可以更好地拟合速率数据或与马斯万克雷文表达式的性能相匹配。此外，从这些模型中得出的参数可以评估其热力学一致性。
