Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by involving molecular oxygen adsorbed on a single site reacting with the substrate being oxidized. However, the model incorrectly assumes that lattice O ions or atoms participate in the reaction, ignoring the fact that molecular oxygen adsorption on a single site is only valid for reactions where oxygen adsorption involves a single site. Additionally, the model does not account for non-elementary steps in the reaction process, the competitive adsorption of intermediates and products, or the inconsistency in considering lattice O ions or atoms as reactive species. As a result, the derived rate expression is deemed incorrect and is only suitable for mathematical data-fitting purposes. Alternative kinetic models, such as Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Hougen-Watson sequences, can provide rate equations that fit experimental data better than the Marsvan Krevelen expression.

该马斯-范雷伦机制通过将分子氧吸附在一个单个站点上与被氧化的基质反应来操作。然而，该模型错误地假设晶格O离子或原子参与反应，忽略了只有在氧气吸附涉及单个站点时才适用于此类反应的事实。此外，该模型没有考虑反应步骤的非基本性，中间体和产物的竞争吸附，或者将晶格O离子或原子视为活性物种的不一致性。因此，推导出的速率表达式被认为是不正确的，仅适用于数学数据拟合用途。替代动力学模型，如兰木-亨肖伍德序列，可以提供比马斯万克列恩表达式更适合实验数据的速率方程。
