[1] "The (3 × 3) periodic adsorption of ethylene was examined on pseudomorphic overlayers of Pd on Re(0001), Ru(0001), Pd(111), and Au(111) substrates, using DFT-GGA slab calculations."
[2] "The adsorption energies for ethylene on PdML/Re(0001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) were estimated to be 10, 31, 62, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively."
[3] "The DFT-computed dissociative adsorption energies for H2 on these surfaces were +2, 6, 78, and 83 kJ/mol, respectively, for 100% surface coverage on each surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to lower catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as it makes the formation of oxygen vacancies less favorable. This affects the surface reactivity and thus the efficiency of the oxidation reaction. The ΔEv depends on the electronic structure and composition of the oxide surface, influencing its ability to facilitate the oxidative processes.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过表面氧化物催化剂上氧空位的形成和迁移进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv通常导致较低的催化活性和氧化能力，因为它使氧空位的形成变得不那么有利。这影响了表面反应性并因此影响了氧化反应的效率。ΔEv依赖于氧化物表面的电子结构和组成，影响其促进氧化过程的能力。
