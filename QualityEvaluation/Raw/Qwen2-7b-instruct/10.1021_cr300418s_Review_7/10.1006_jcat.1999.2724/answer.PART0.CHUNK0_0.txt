[1] "The computed (3 × 3) di-σ binding energy for ethylene on PdML/Re(00001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) are 10, 31, 62, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively."
[2] "The adsorption of ethylene is least favorable on PdML/Re(0001) with a very weak binding energy of 10 kJ/mol."
[3] "The weaker ethylene adsorption energy for Pd monolayers on Re(0001) and Ru(0001) are due to the weaker backdonation interaction between the surface Pd d-band and the ethylene π*-orbital."
[4] "The weaker adsorption energy for ethylene on PdML/Re(0001) and PdML/Ru(0001), relative to Pd(111), is because of the weaker backdonation interaction between the metal d-band and the ethylene π*-orbital."

1. 计算得到，乙烯在PdML/Re(00001)，PdML/Ru(0001)，Pd(111)和PdML/Au(111)上的（3 × 3）di-σ结合能分别为10，31，62和78 kJ/mol。
2. 乙烯在PdML/Re(0001)上的吸附最不利，其结合能仅为10 kJ/mol。
3. 乙烯在Re(0001)和Ru(0001)上的Pd单层中吸附能力较弱的原因是表面Pd d带与乙烯π*轨道之间的背捐赠相互作用较弱。
4. 乙烯在PdML/Re(0001)和PdML/Ru(0001)上相对于Pd(111)的吸附能较弱，是因为金属d带与乙烯π*轨道之间的背捐赠相互作用较弱。
