The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to lower catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as it makes the formation of oxygen vacancies less favorable. This affects the surface reactivity and thus the efficiency of the oxidation reaction. The ΔEv depends on the electronic structure and composition of the oxide surface, influencing its ability to facilitate the oxidative processes.
