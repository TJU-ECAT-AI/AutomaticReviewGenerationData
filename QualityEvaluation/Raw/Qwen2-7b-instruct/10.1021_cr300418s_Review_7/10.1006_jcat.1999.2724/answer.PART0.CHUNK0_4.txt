[1] "The adsorption energies for ethylene on PdML/Re(0001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) were estimated to be 10, 31, 62, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively."
[2] "The computed (3 × 3) di-σ binding energy for ethylene on PdML/Re(00001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) are 10, 31, 62, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively."
[3] "The weaker adsorption energy for ethylene on PdML/Re(0001) and PdML/Ru(0001), relative to Pd(111), is because of the weaker backdonation interaction between the metal d-band and the ethylene π*-orbital."
[4] "The correlation between the CH bond activation barrier and overall reaction energy is most evident for the β-hydride elimination of both ethyl and ethylene, which have slopes of 0.65."
[5] "The PdML/Au(111) surface, which has the d-band center closest to the Fermi level, amongst all the surfaces examined here, has the lowest barrier for CH bond breaking."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to enhance the surface activity of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The document does not explicitly discuss the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism or the specifics of ΔEv in the context of the questions asked.
