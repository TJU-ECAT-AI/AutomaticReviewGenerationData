[1] "The (3 × 3) periodic adsorption of ethylene was examined on pseudomorphic overlayers of Pd on Re(0001), Ru(0001), Pd(111), and Au(111) substrates, using DFT-GGA slab calculations."
[2] "The adsorption energies for ethylene on PdML/Re(0001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) were estimated to be 10, 31, 62, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively."
[3] "The weaker adsorption energy for ethylene on PdML/Re(0001) and PdML/Ru(0001), relative to Pd(111), is because of the weaker backdonation interaction between the metal d-band and the ethylene π*-orbital."
[4] "The correlation between the CH bond activation barrier and overall reaction energy is most evident for the β-hydride elimination of both ethyl and ethylene, which have slopes of 0.65."
[5] "The CH bond activation process is primarily governed by the backdonation of electrons from the metal into the antibonding σ*-orbital of the adsorbate."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation influences the surface's ability to facilitate the transfer of electrons and oxygen, thus affecting the efficiency of the oxidation reaction.
