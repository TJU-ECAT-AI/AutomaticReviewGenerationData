[1] "The computed (3 × 3) di-σ binding energy for ethylene on PdML/Re(00001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) are 10, 31, 62, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively."

[3] "The calculated trends in the overall reaction energies for the hydrogenation of ethylene to surface ethyl are very similar to those of ethylene adsorption."

1. The computed di-σ binding energy for ethylene on PdML/Re(0001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) are 10, 31, 62, and 78 kJ/mol, respectively. 
2. The DFT-calculated binding energy of atomic hydrogen on PdML/Re(0001), PdML/Ru(0001), Pd(111), and PdML/Au(111) are 217, 221, 257, and 260 kJ/mol, respectively.
3. The trends in the overall reaction energies for the hydrogenation of ethylene to surface ethyl are similar to the trends in ethylene adsorption.
4. The dissociative adsorption of H2 on PdML/Re(0001) and PdML/Ru(0001) is almost thermoneutral.
5. The trends are consistent with Hammett's ideas suggesting that the slope of the correlation holds for other molecules, given the same reaction mechanism.

1. 乙烯在PdML/Re(0001)，PdML/Ru(0001)，Pd(111)，和PdML/Au(111)上的计算的二σ结合能分别为10，31，62和78千焦每摩尔。
2. 原子氢在PdML/Re(0001)，PdML/Ru(0001)，Pd(111)，和PdML/Au(111)上的DFT计算的吸附能分别为217，221，257和260千焦每摩尔。
3. 乙烷氢化到表面乙基的整体反应能量趋势与乙烷吸附的趋势非常相似。
4. PdML/Re(0001)和PdML/Ru(0001)表面上的H2解离吸附几乎是热中性的。
5. 这些趋势与Hammett的想法一致，即在反应机制相同的情况下，相关性的斜率将适用于其他分子。
