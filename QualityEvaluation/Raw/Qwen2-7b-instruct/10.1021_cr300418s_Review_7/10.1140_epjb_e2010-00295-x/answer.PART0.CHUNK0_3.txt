1. Oxygen vacancies can stabilize metallic particles on oxide surfaces, making them resistant to sintering.
2. In the case of undoped ceria, the electrons released by an oxygen vacancy primarily occupy the 4f states of the two Ce cations near the vacancy.
3. Structural distortions caused by doping lead to a significant decrease in the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation.
4. In the Ir-doped system, the largest displacement of an O atom towards the vacancy is 0.65 A, while the Ir atom moves away by 0.20 A, indicating substantial structural changes.
5. Upon doping, the gap states between the O2p band and the empty Ce4f states in the DOS become higher and wider, suggesting no significant alteration in the electronic structure.
6. The electron localization pattern around the Ir dopant remains similar to that in the unreduced system.
7. The Bader charge analysis reveals 2.97 electrons localized on the dopant, comparable to the unreduced system.
8. The spin magnetic moment of the Ir dopant in the doped system is 0.63μB, closely resembling that in the unreduced system (0.70μB).
9. The electronic structure of the reduced ceria remains largely unchanged following Ir doping, indicating that electronic relaxation is not the primary factor affecting the oxygen vacancy formation energy.
10. The energy differences between the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) configurations are insignificant, supporting the conclusion that the electronic structure is not significantly altered.

1. 氧空位可以稳定氧化物表面支持的金属颗粒，使其不易结粒。
2. 在无掺杂的铈氧化物中，被移除的氧原子释放的电子主要占据与氧空位相邻的两个铈离子的4f状态。
3. 掺杂导致的结构畸变能显著降低氧空位形成所需的能量。
4. 在Ir掺杂系统中，最远向空位移动的O原子为0.65 A，而Ir原子则向空位移动0.20 A，表明存在显著的结构变化。
5. 掺杂后，位于O2p带和空的Ce4f状态之间的间隙态上升并加宽，暗示电子结构没有显著改变。
6. Ir掺杂周围的电子局域化模式与未掺杂系统相似。
7. Bader电荷分析显示，掺杂剂上共局域了2.97个电子，与未掺杂系统相当。
8. Ir掺杂系统的磁矩为0.63μB，接近于未掺杂系统的值（0.70μB）。
9. Ir掺杂后，减少的铈氧化物的电子结构基本保持不变，说明电子弛豫不是影响氧空位形成能的主要因素。
10. 负磁矩（FM）和反负磁矩（AFM）配置之间的能量差异微不足道，支持结论认为电子结构并未显著改变。
