[1] "For the PROX reaction, the highly reducible ceria support also participates directly or indirectly in the CO oxidation."
[2] "The main conclusions from our work so far are as follows. Doping markedly facilitates the reduction of the oxygen atoms near the doping centers."
[3] "The formation energy of a surface O vacancy is 2.90 eV which is consistent with our previous value of 2.89 eV."
[4] "For the doped systems, a similar definition for the O vacancy formation energy is used."
[5] "The Ir doping makes structural distortions much more exothermic for the reduced ceria."
[6] "For the surface redox reactions, the dopant cations could serve as the active centers."
[7] "The Ir cation moves away from the vacancy by 0.19 A."
[8] "Integration of the DOS for these gap states using the Bader charge analysis gives a total of 2.97 electrons localized on the dopant."
[9] "This further indicates that the electronic structures of the dopant are not sensitive to the formation of the O vacancy."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the use of surface oxygens from the ceria support in the oxidation of CO. The high reducibility of the ceria support enables direct or indirect participation in CO oxidation.
2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv suggests easier reduction and increased activity.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制涉及到使用氧化物表面的氧原子进行CO氧化。高度可还原的氧化铈支持能够直接或间接参与CO氧化。
2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性影响。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易被还原，从而增加活性。
