[1] "For all three NMs we have investigated, however, the electronic relaxation appears to play a more important role than structural relaxation for the reduction of the formation energy of oxygen vacancy."
[2] "In addition, the Ir-O bond lengths contract by up to 0.26 A."
[3] "This is because the electrons left by the removed oxygen atom are still situated in this gap."
[4] "These results are similar to our findings for Zr-doped ceria [17] and we conclude that Ir doping does not significantly change the electronic structure of the reduced ceria and it is expected that electronic relaxation is not the main factor responsible for the significant changes of the O vacancy formation energy."

1. In the context of oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the use of surface oxygens from the oxide support in the reaction. Oxygen vacancies on the surface facilitate this process, as they allow for direct participation of surface oxygens in the reaction, often through the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values typically correlate with higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the ease of creating and stabilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface, which enhances the reactivity of the oxide.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-克雷威尔恩机制涉及使用氧化物支持表面的氧。表面氧空位允许在反应中直接参与此过程，通常通过火星-克雷威尔恩机制。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值通常与更高的催化活性和氧化能力相关联，因为这使得在表面上创建和稳定氧空位变得更加容易，从而增强了氧化物的反应性。
