[1] "For the WGS reaction, a redox mechanism is plausible, where CO adsorbs on the metal and reacts at the metal-support interface with the oxygen from the ceria support, forming CO2. The reduced ceria support is then re-oxidized by H2O, forming H2."
[2] "The main conclusions from our work so far are as follows. Doping markedly facilitates the reduction of the oxygen atoms near the dopant centers. Usually, there are two major factors responsible for the decrease of the oxygen vacancy formation energy. On the one hand, the dopant modifies the electronic structures of the reduced ceria (electronic relaxation), and on the other hand it facilitates the structural distortions (structural relaxation)."
[3] "It is found that, although the Ir doping induces gap states (MIGS) as do other noble metals (Pd, Pt, Rh), the structural relaxation (instead of the electronic structure relaxation) is the main factor responsible for the decrease of the oxygen vacancy formation energy, i.e., the Ir doping makes structural distortions much more exothermic for the reduced ceria."
[4] "The most stable O vacancies are those around the dopant and their Evac values (1.64, 1.07 and 1.45 eV for VO4, VO5 and VO7, respectively) are much smaller than those for the undoped system (2.90 and 2.55 eV for the surface and subsurface oxygen vacancy respectively)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO adsorbing onto the metal surface and reacting with oxygen from the oxide support to form CO2. The reduced oxide support is then re-oxidized by water, yielding H2. Oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, with lower ΔEv indicating a more active surface. In Ir-doped ceria, structural relaxation rather than electronic relaxation is the primary factor reducing the oxygen vacancy formation energy, enhancing the surface's reducibility and catalytic properties.

火星-克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中，涉及CO吸附到金属表面并与氧化物支持的氧反应生成CO2。还原的氧化物支持随后通过水被氧化，产生H2。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用，较低的ΔEv表明表面活性更强。在Ir掺杂的铈中，结构松弛而非电子结构松弛是降低氧空位形成能的主要因素，增强表面的可还原性和催化性能。
