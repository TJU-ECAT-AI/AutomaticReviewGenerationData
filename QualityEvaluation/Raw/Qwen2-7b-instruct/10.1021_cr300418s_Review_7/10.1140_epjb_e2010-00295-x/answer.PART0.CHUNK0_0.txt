[1] "In addition, oxygen vacancies can stabilize metallic particles supported on oxide surfaces [11,12], by making them resistant to sintering."
[2] "Experiments have demonstrated that ceria doping can efficiently improve its reducibility and catalytic redox ac- tivity [13,14]."
[3] "The current study has been undertaken with the purpose to determine and understand the main factor(s) influencing the reducibility of Ir-doped ceria."
[4] "Ir/CeO2 catalysts have been found to be highly ac- tive and selective for hydrogen production by oxidation stream reforming of ethanol."
[5] "The promotion effect was partly attributed to the enhanced reducibility and oxygen storage-release capacity of Ir/CeO2 as compared with pure ceria [20,21]."
[6] "Particularly, when Ir particles are embedded into ceria, the catalyst demonstrates high selectivity and reactivity for the PROX reaction which is believed to pro- ceed via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [8,16,22]."
[7] "In the DFT+U method [28,29], a Hubbard parameter, U,is introduced for the Ce4f electrons to describe the on- site Coulomb interactions and the U value is chosen to be 5.0 eV, since it is found previously that for U = 5 eV and greater, the localization of the Ce4f electrons in the partially reduced ceria can be properly described [30,31]."
[8] "The characteristics of the TDOS for the CeO2(111) surface with a subsurface O vacancy (not shown) are just the same as that for the surface with a surface O vacancy."
[9] "Again, doping does not significantly change the electronic structures."
