[1] "The oxidation of carbon monoxide over CeO2-based materials under aerobic and anaerobic conditions has been the subject of intense investigation in recent years [6,1619]."
[2] "It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Marsvan Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy,which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen."
[3] "Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle. The presence of carbonate-like adsorbates as intermediates before CO2 desorption is a possibility, especially under cycled feedstream conditions [3,6,20,21]."
[4] "In addition, it is also known that the ad- sorption behavior of CO on ceria surfaces is strongly related to the nature of the surfaces used in the experiments [25]; in particular, whereas only weak adsorption has been predicted for the {111}-type surface, both weak and strong adsorption is detected on the {110}-type surface, giving rise to carbon- ate formation."
[5] "The different reactivity of CO with exposed surfaces of ceria is also the result of the different stabilities of exposed planes."
[6] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [810,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces."
[7] "Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."
[8] "The main consequence of this finding is that the redox reactivity of ceria (especially toward CO) might strongly depend on the type and amount of surfaces exposed to the gas phase."
[9] "Unfortunately,nanocrystalline ceria powders predominantly expose their least reactive {111} surfaces, and preparation of polycrys- talline materials with preferential exposure of specific reac- tive planes is very difficult."
[10] "Other factors that can positively influence specific activity on large ceria crystallites are also discussed."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO reacting with surface ceria, leading to the formation of an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower ΔEv are more reactive and facilitate CO oxidation more efficiently.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves CO reacting with surface ceria, resulting in the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for this process (ΔEv) influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates more reactive surfaces that enhance CO oxidation efficiency.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及CO与表面铈化物反应，导致氧空位的形成。随后，这些空位由气相氧补充。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明更活跃的表面，能更有效地促进CO氧化。
