[1] "It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Marsvan Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy,which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen."
[2] "Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."
[3] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100}, with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces."
[4] "Although specifically supported for {110} and not for {100} surfaces, a stronger interaction of CO with this surface might lead to easier formation of carbonate-like adsorbates, which is a key step in carbon monoxide oxidation over ceria particles."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO reacting with the surface ceria, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as more reactive surfaces require less energy to form oxygen vacancies, facilitating CO oxidation.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及CO与表面铈化物反应，形成氧空位。然后通过气相氧补全这个空位。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，因为更活跃的表面需要较少的能量来形成氧空位，从而促进CO氧化。
