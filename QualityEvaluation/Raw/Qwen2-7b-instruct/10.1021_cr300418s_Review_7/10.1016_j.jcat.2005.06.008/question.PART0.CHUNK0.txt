1. Introduction
Cerium dioxide is a key component in the formulation of several commercial catalysts. Its major use is as a pro- moter in the catalysts used for reducing CO, hydrocarbons,and NOx emissions from gasoline engines, where it acts as an oxygen storage/release medium that is continuously reduced and oxidized under cycling feedstream conditions [1,2]. A complex series of redox reactions occurs on the ce- ria surface in the presence of lean/rich gas mixtures, which involve continuous formation and annihilation of oxygen va- cancies and changes in the redox state of cerium (IV/III). CO oxidation is one of the key steps in the overall process, and therefore it has frequently been used as a probe reaction over ceria-based materials to evaluate different catalyst formula- tions and investigate mechanistic issues [37]. It is generally * Corresponding author. Fax: +39-0432-558803.

Trovarelli). accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions oc- curs over pure ceria by a Marsvan Krevelen-type mecha- nism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxida- tion of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen va- cancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment by gas-phase oxygen. Therefore an understanding of the structure and relative stability of the surfaces of CeO2 can provide useful insights closely related to catalytic reactions that normally take place on these surfaces. A few theoretical studies have investigated the structure and relative stability of surfaces of CeO2, and the results have indicated that the compact {111} surfaces are the most stable (and are there- fore less reactive), followed by {110}, {100}, and {211} [810]. It has recently been reported that materials with 1D-like morphology specifically prepared to predominantly expose these planes are more reactive than conventionally prepared cerium oxide in CO oxidation [11]. Although in this case comparison of activity has been made on the ba- sis of light-off curves only, it was shown that 1D materials in the form of nanorods exposing {100} and {110} planes 0021-9517/$  see front matter 2005 Elsevier Inc.

89 have a higher reactivity toward CO oxidation. Unfortunately,nanocrystalline ceria powders predominantly expose their least reactive {111} surfaces, and preparation of polycrys- talline materials with preferential exposure of specific reac- tive planes is very difficult. A correlation between sample morphology and overall catalyst performance has also re- cently been reported for samples of mesoporous ceria [12].It was found that the conversion of different catalysts (mea- sured by comparing T50 in light-off curves) against surface area has a maximum in the range of 9001000 K, and this was correlated with changes in the morphology and in the characteristics of pore structure of the samples.
The work presented here further proceeds along these lines, by widening the investigation to the determination of specific activity under controlled kinetic conditions and by using different sets of starting materials with the aim of ex- tending our conclusions to ceria powders, regardless of the preparation methods used. It was found that aging under air of polycrystalline ceria samples caused the rearrangement of crystallites, with loss of surface area and exposure of more reactive surfaces, which increases the specific activity in CO oxidation. However, because of the lower surface area of samples, the overall activity on a per-gram basis is lower.
Other factors that can positively influence specific activity on large ceria crystallites are also discussed.
2. Experimental
Three different high-surface area samples of polycrys- talline ceria powders were used as starting materials through- out this study. They were prepared according to different methods and are designated as CA, CB, and CC. Fresh CA sample (surface area 143 m2/g) was prepared by moder- ate calcination (473 K) of cerium carbonate obtained from Ce(NO3)3 by precipitation with NH4HCO3. CB was pre- pared according to a process that involves the precipitation of a homogeneous acidic solution of cerium nitrate with a base. The filter cake is then washed with distilled water, fol- lowed by spray drying and calcination at 573 K. CC is a commercial sample of stabilized ceria prepared by a pro- prietary method and calcined at 773 K. The purity of samples was checked by chemical analysis; CA and CB samples had a purity greater than 99.8%, and the purity of the CC sam- ple was greater than 99.4%. Main impurities for all samples were lanthanide oxides (La, Pr, Nd, Sm), alkaline earth ox- ides (CaO, MgO), and SiO2. Traces of Na and Cl were also found.
We treated freshly prepared samples under air in a tubular furnace at different temperatures (up to 1073 K for a period of 2 h) in order to prepare a series of catalysts with increasing crystallite size and decreasing BET surface area. Textural and morphological properties of samples are summarized in Table 1. For brevity, samples are indicated followed by their calcination temperature: for example, CA calcined at 973 for 2 h is indicated as CA973.

BET surface area and pore size distribution were evalu- ated from the adsorption isotherm with a Sorptomatic 1990 porosimeter.
Structural features of the catalysts were investigated by X-ray diffraction. Spectra were recorded on a Philips XPert diffractometer (equipped with a real-time multiple strip de- tector) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, with Ni-filtered Cu-Kα radiation. Spectra were collected with a step size of 0.02 and a counting time of 40 s per angular abscissa in the range of 20145. Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern was per- formed by means of a GSAS-EXPGUI program. The mean crystallite size was estimated from the full width at half- maximum with the Scherrer formula.
TG analysis was carried out with a Q500 thermobalance (TA Instruments) under an air flow. Microstructural char- acterization by high-resolution transmission electron mi- croscopy (HRTEM) was carried out with a JEOL 2010F instrument equipped with a field emission gun, which made it possible to achieve a point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm and a resolution of 0.14 nm between lines. Samples were de- posited directly on holey carbon-coated grids.
Catalytic activity measurements were carried out in a steady-state glass micro flow reactor (Φ = 6 mm, L = 300 mm) operated in a temperature range of 300 T 1100 K, with a total flow of 0.1 l/min. Typical feed condi- tions were as follows: CO (2%), O2 (1%), and N2 as diluent,with a GHSV of ca. 2 × 105 h1. Analysis of CO, O2, and CO2 was carried out under continuous conditions with an on-line infrared analyzer (ABB Uras-14 for CO, CO2) and a paramagnetic O2 analyzer (ABB Magnos-106). We col- lected conversion-versus-temperature curves (light-off pro- files) by increasing the temperature at a rate of 10 K/min and monitoring conversion. Rate of CO oxidation has been determined at low conversion by assuming differential re- actor conditions (i.e., conv. <5%); accuracy of rate values is within 15%, as determined by repeated measurements at fixed temperature. Reaction conditions were chosen to mini- mize the effect of mass and heat transfer phenomena. The 90

51 absence of external and internal diffusion limitation was confirmed by experiments. We checked limitations in exter- nal transfer phenomena by measuring conversion at increas- ing W/F (catalyst weight/total flow) ratio and maintaining constant space velocity. A series of runs carried out under these conditions did not indicate any variation in conver- sion, thus ruling out any limiting effect of external diffusion phenomena. The absence of strong resistance to internal dif- fusion was determined by evaluation of the activation energy for the reaction in the temperature range investigated as re- ported in the following sections.
3. Results
3.1. Structural and textural properties
Powder X-ray diffraction data confirm in all samples the presence of crystalline CeO2 as the only detectable phase.
The formation of a cubic fluorite lattice of Fm3m symme- try is always detected, with almost identical cell parameters.
For CA samples a slight modification of cell parameter is observed after calcination at lower temperatures (Table 2),indicating the likely presence of some Ce3+ in samples with smaller crystallite size. This also agrees with the lat- tice expansion that has been observed in the fluorite-type lattice constant of CeO2/CeO2x nanoparticles in the size range of 28 nm due to the presence of Ce3+ (either resid- ual Ce3+ due to incomplete oxidation of oxide precursors and/or Ce3+ due to structural/quantum confinement or other physico-chemical effects [13]). For CB and CC samples lat- tice constants agree with a full CeO2 stoichiometry at all calcination temperatures, in agreement with their crystallite size larger than 8 nm.
The average crystallite size as shown in Table 1 increases continuously with calcination temperature due to sintering.
In accordance with this, larger particles display progres- sively lower BET surface area, which decreases continu- ously with temperature. Isotherms of type IV were obtained for all samples. From an examination of pore size distribu- tion curves it can be concluded that for samples CA and CB,the largest area contribution is from pores less than 120 Å in diameter, whereas larger pores are found in sample CC re- gardless of calcination temperatures. Microporosity is absent in samples with a BET surface area lower than ca. 80 m2/g.

3.2. Surface morphology and exposed planes
Surface morphology of samples was investigated by transmission electron microscopy techniques. All samples displayed similar characteristics (sample CA was more dif- ficult to study because of the presence of aggregates of ceria particles that were poorly resolved); we will com- ment here on images related to sample CB in the so-called fresh state (calcined at 573 K), after calcination at low temperature (CB773) and after calcination at high tem- perature (CB1073). TEM and electron diffraction analysis of the three samples revealed that they are constituted by CeO2 crystallites. For fresh sample, electron diffraction pat- terns recorded in selected-area mode (SAED) in several regions show smooth rings, which indicate that the sample is polycrystalline and is constituted by very small crystal- lites. As a representative example, Fig. 1 shows an aggregate and its corresponding SAED pattern along with an inte- grated intensity-spacing profile. The reciprocal spacings of the electron diffraction pattern and their relative intensity confirm cerium dioxide as the only crystalline phase. High- resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM) was used to accurately calculate the size of the crystallites by lattice-fringe analysis. The distribution of crystallite size is very homogeneous and is centered at ca. 78 nm, compared with a value of 10 nm calculated from XRD (Table 1).

It has been possible to characterize CB773 and the sam- ple oxidized at 1073 K at the atomic scale by HREM over a large number of individual CeO2 crystallites (more than 30 crystals for each sample). By identifying the lattice spac- ings and particle orientation, we determined the facets on the particle surfaces. Because of the agglomeration of particles,caution was taken to distinguish between lattice fringes of the same crystal and those originating from crystal overlap- ping.
Fig. 2 shows various individual, representative CeO2 crystals in the CB773 sample (ad). All of the crystallites are oriented along the [011] crystallographic direction. The labeling of the crystal planes for each particle is indicated in the figure. It is deduced that the dominant lattice fringes in all cases correspond to the {111} family, at 3.12 Å. The sharp faces of the CeO2 crystals have very few surface steps and consist of symmetry-related {111}-type surfaces. The shape of most particles is compatible with an octahedron en- closed by eight {111} planes (Figs. 2a and b). These crystals exhibit also sharp tips, with only a few cerium atoms at the narrowest point. In addition to {111} planes, some particles of the fresh sample also exhibit {100}-type surfaces. This is illustrated in the crystallites depicted in Figs. 2c and d,where, in addition to {111} planes, there is also the presence of (200) planes at 2.71 Å. Occasional steps with {111}-type nanofaceting are indicated by arrows in Fig. 2d.
Typical images from the CeO2 crystallites in the sample oxidized at 1073 K are displayed in Figs. 3ad. Again, all of the crystallites are oriented along the [011] crystallographic direction. In these samples the CeO2 crystallites probably Fig. 3. Representative high-resolution TEM images of CB1073. Nanoparti- cles are oriented along the [011] crystallographic direction, showing {111}- and {100}-type facet structures. agglomerate by minimizing the interface energy with the for- mation of a lattice-matched coherent interface [14], which may explain the observed distribution of crystallites with a preferred orientation of [011]. In this case, extensive {100} facets are encountered in addition to {111} planes. The treat- ment under oxygen results in the truncation of the sharp tips between two {111}-type surfaces along the perpendicular [100] crystallographic direction, originating the (200) planes depicted in Fig. 3. This is consistent with the truncated octa- hedral shape of the crystallites, which is the new surface of the {100}-type.
3.3. Catalytic tests
A representative series of curves showing the effect of calcination temperature on CO conversion under stationary conditions over CA samples is presented in Fig. 4. A typi- cal smooth light-off behavior is observed; the shape of the curves shows that conversion is negligible at low temper- ature (T < 500 K), and in all cases investigated the onset of activity starts at 500600 K, with total conversion ap- proached at ca. 750 K for most samples. Overall activity on a per-gram basis follows the inverse order of calcination tem- peratures, where the sample calcined at high temperatures is the least active (i.e., activity of CA473 > CA573 > ··· >
CA1073).
We made an accurate determination of specific activity by measuring the rate of CO oxidation at low conversions (from the conversion-vs.-temperature curves), assuming dif- ferential reactor conditions, under a kinetically controlled regime. The advantage over a measurement carried out by 92

For conditions see experimental section. evaluation of T50 only is the possibility of calculating the specific turnover rate, which excludes the contribution of surface area to the measured values. In addition, the rate is measured under a kinetic regime, since conversion at T50 is sometimes influenced by diffusion and mass-transfer phe- nomena [15]. Fig. 5 displays rate data against crystallite size;the overall picture is now more clear; specific activity shows a marked dependence on the crystallite size, regardless of the preparation history of the sample. Particularly in the size range from 10 to 40 nm, the activity is strongly dependent on crystallite size, whereas the increase in activity for particles larger than 40 nm seems to reach limiting values, at least for samples CA and CB.
4. Discussion
The oxidation of carbon monoxide over CeO2-based ma- terials under aerobic and anaerobic conditions has been the subject of intense investigation in recent years [6,1619].
It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism in- volves a redox Marsvan Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy,which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle. The presence of carbonate-like adsorbates as intermediates before CO2 des- orption is a possibility, especially under cycled feedstream conditions [3,6,20,21]. It is in fact reported that carbonate- like or inorganic carboxylate-like complexes of CO are formed on a CeO2 surface when it is exposed to a CO at- mosphere [2224]. In addition, it is also known that the ad- sorption behavior of CO on ceria surfaces is strongly related to the nature of the surfaces used in the experiments [25]; in Fig. 5. Specific rate of CO oxidation calculated at 543 K against crsyatllite size for CA (2), CB (Q), and CC (") samples. particular, whereas only weak adsorption has been predicted for the {111}-type surface, both weak and strong adsorption is detected on the {110}-type surface, giving rise to carbon- ate formation. The different reactivity of CO with exposed surfaces of ceria is also the result of the different stabilities of exposed planes. It is known from the theoretical molec- ular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [810,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to ac- commodate here reaction with CO. The main consequence of this finding is that the redox reactivity of ceria (espe- cially toward CO) might strongly depend on the type and amount of surfaces exposed to the gas phase. As a matter of fact, it has recently been demonstrated that nanorods pref- erentially exposing the unusually reactive {100} and {110} planes have a lower light-off temperature for CO oxidation than their counterpart irregular nanoparticles [11].
In polycrystalline ceria the situation is much more com- plex, since preferential exposure of different planes is diffi- cult to control, although it has been found that ceria surfaces consisting exclusively of {111} lattice planes, upon anneal- ing at 1073 K, form a well-defined portion of {100} sur- faces [27]. Changes in surface morphology and in the pore structure were also recently shown to be the origin of dif- ferent activities of samples of mesoporous ceria [15]. Also in this case, the activity data are compared by evaluation of T50 in light-off curves carried out at different space ve- locities, and the shape of light-off curves cannot exclude an effect of mass transport limitation within pores, which poses a few limits on the generalization of the conclusions reached in this investigation. Our study reveals that pref- erential exposure of specific surfaces upon treatment under

oxidizing conditions is found also in pure crystalline ceria,regardless of the preparation method used. Although mea- sured on a qualitative basis, this finding is supported by the large (and statistically significant) number of individual crystallites that were examined. The above HRTEM studies indicate that CeO2 particles after calcination at high temper- ature expose, in addition to {111} planes, well-defined and less stable {100} planes, whereas in CeO2 not subjected to high temperature treatments, the most stable {111} planes are predominantly exposed. In addition, at calcination tem- peratures above 773 K, the change in exposed surfaces re- sults in an increase in specific rate of CO oxidation.
The observed increase in specific reaction rate value upon calcination might be the consequence of several physico- chemical modifications of the surface of ceria crystallites.
We will try to present evidence here that there is a relation between preferential plane exposure and increase in CO ox- idation rate, and at the same time we will attempt to exclude the presence of other phenomena.
We have found that the strong surface area loss that fol- lows calcination is always accompanied by an increase in mean particle diameter and average pore size. This can af- fect intra- and extra-particle diffusion resistance. In particu- lar, resistance to internal pore diffusion in high-surface area particles would have the effect of reducing the apparent spe- cific reaction rate in materials that have a relevant fraction of surface area constituted by micro pores. The overall ef- fect would be an increase in specific reaction rate after high calcination temperatures, due to a drop in internal pore dif- fusion. A quite general and simple method for excluding any intra-particle diffusional limitation is the calculation of acti- vation energy in the range of temperature of interest [28].
Table 3 summarizes the results of an internal diffusion test:they show that regardless of the sample used, the activation energy does not depend on calcination temperatures. The values found are around 1416 kcal/mol, close to those re- ported for CO oxidation under similar conditions [29,30].
This rules out the possibility that measurements of specific rate values were influenced by internal porosity of our sam- ples.
The presence of impurities in samples calcined at low temperature is another matter that deserves further investi- gation. Because of the preparation method used in our study, Fig. 6. Weight loss and derivative weight profiles as measured with a TG ex- periment conducted by heating under air fresh samples from 473 to 1273 K at 10 K/min. Dotted line (weight loss, right axis) and solid line (derivative weight, left axis). the presence of residual carbonates and nitrates is a pos- sibility in samples calcined at low temperature (especially carbonates in sample CA). Fig. 6 shows a TG analysis of the three ceria samples conducted under air, which indicates a significant weight loss for the CA sample between 500 and 850 K, corresponding to the decomposition of surface carbonates and minor desorption features for CB and CC samples. For calcination temperatures of 9001100 K, in the region where CO oxidation activity is strongly enhanced, no significant weight loss is detected, thus ruling out a possi- ble role of desorption of surface impurities in the increase of activity observed on samples calcined at high temper- atures. In a plot of the first derivative of the weight loss signal, several contributions are indicated at low tempera- tures, with a maximum for CA and CB samples at ca. 760 K,and a broad shoulder above this temperature. This is likely to be associated with elimination of bulk ceria carbonates that need relatively high calcination temperatures [3]. Des- orption of carbonates, especially for CA samples, does not seem to influence the specific rate of CO oxidation, as in- ferred from the fact that no relevant changes in activity are observed in CA samples calcined in the range of 470800 K (the samples have higher surface area), where most of the surface carbonate decomposition takes place. However, one thing that can explain the difference in activity of CA(473 873) and CB/CC samples is the possibility that desorption of carbonates indirectly affects the activity by blocking the development of {100} faces. This hypothesis, suggested by a referee, can be supported by the fact that activity in the CA sample sharply increased after desorption of carbonates at high temperatures (most likely bulk carbonates) but is not affected during desoprtion of carbonates at lower tempera- tures.
Stoichiometry of ceria particles should also be taken into account to properly address the issue of specific activity in 94

CO oxidation. We have found that in the CA sample, the lat- tice parameters of smaller ceria particles (CA473CA773) agree with the presence of some Ce3+ in the lattice. It is known that nanoparticles of ceria can strongly deviate from stoichiometry because of the presence of Ce3+ [14,31,32],and it is also reported that in nanocrystalline ceria powder the thermodynamics and kinetics of reduction may strongly vary from what is generally observed in bulk ceria [33]. The presence of Ce3+ and associated surface vacancies would lower the number of active sites for CO reaction, thus de- creasing specific activity calculated on a square-meter basis.
The amount of Ce3+ found in our samples, keeping also in mind that more surface Ce3+ could have escaped XRD de- tection, is localized on samples with a small crystal size and showing almost constant activity. No changes in stoichiom- etry are observed in any samples where changes of activity were detected. In any case, for the majority of samples, the atmosphere of reaction should guarantee the presence of sto- ichiometric ceria at the reaction temperature.
Having excluded several major possible explanations of the increase in the CO oxidation rate against calcination tem- perature, we might now rationalize this behavior in terms of (i) preferential formation of more reactive {100} planes after calcination of crystalline ceria powders in the range of temperature between 573 and 1073 K and (ii) particu- larly favorable energetics expected for CO oxidation over these reactive surfaces. The favorable formation of {100}- type surfaces upon treatment at high temperature under O2- containing atmospheres has already been reported for ori- ented CeO2 films [27]. In the case of polycrystalline ceria,some conflicting observations were found in the literature: it is known that CeO2 particles preferentially expose the {111} planes, which is the one of lowest energy [1]. In agreement with this, HRTEM studies of CeO2 reveal that high-surface- area samples show grains oriented to expose predominantly {111} planes. This preferential exposure was reported to be- come dramatically apparent after mild oxidation at 773 K compared with fresh samples [34], thus excluding in this study {100} faceting. Conversely, Lunberg et al. [10] re- ported that from calcination temperatures of 773 to 973 K,{100} facets were clearly present, and their formation was attributed to calcination, since at T < 773 K no {100} facets were observed. In this work, an increase in {100} facets is progressively observed after calcination of polycrystalline ceria at T > 773 K. Therefore, it might be concluded that,excluding a transition region around 773 K, temperatures higher than 773 K favor the exposure of more reactive planes. To address the second point raised above, we sug- gest that improved activity of CeO2 after calcination is due to the greater capacity of CeO2 {100}-type surfaces com- pared with {111} to help CO oxidation by supplying oxy- gen and changing valence. A similar mechanism of action was described earlier with Pt(111) on ordered (111) CeO2 film [35] and on CuO supported on CeO2(100) surfaces [27].
In these cases CO oxidation benefits from the presence of the redox of ceria, which is facilitated when more reactive planes are exposed. In addition, although specifically sup- ported for {110} and not for {100} surfaces, a stronger inter- action of CO with this surface might lead to easier formation of carbonate-like adsorbates, which is a key step in carbon monoxide oxidation over ceria particles.
In summary, evidence is presented that highlights the role of reactive surfaces in CO oxidation over different samples of polycrystalline ceria powders prepared by conventional methods. These samples, in a fresh state, expose preferen- tially the more stable {111}-type surfaces, and after ther- mal treatment more reactive surfaces become visible, at the expense of a drop in surface area. Therefore, observations recently reported for 1D ceria samples obtained by more so- phisticated techniques have been extended to conventionally prepared polycrystalline ceria samples with catalytic data recorded under conditions that were determined to be free from mass transport limitations. The possibility of expos- ing more reactive surfaces by nonconventional techniques,thus preserving high surface area, would therefore represent a key and challenging step in the design of ceria-based cata- lysts with enhanced redox properties.

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
