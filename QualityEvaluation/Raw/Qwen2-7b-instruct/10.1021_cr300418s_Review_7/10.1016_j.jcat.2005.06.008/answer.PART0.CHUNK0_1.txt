[1] "It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Marsvan Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy,which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen."
[2] "Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."
[3] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a redox process. Carbon monoxide reacts with the surface ceria of the oxide, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy barrier affects how easily reactions occur and the efficiency of the oxidation process.

火星-范-克里维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一个还原氧化过程进行操作。一氧化碳与氧化物表面的铈反应，形成氧空位。然后，该空位由气体相氧补充。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。这个能垒影响反应的发生易度和氧化过程的效率。
