[1] "It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Marsvan Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy,which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen."

[3] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100}, with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces."
[4] "Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."
[5] "An increase in specific rate value upon calcination might be the consequence of several physico-chemical modifications of the surface of ceria crystallites."
[6] "We suggest that improved activity of CeO2 after calcination is due to the greater capacity of CeO2 {100}-type surfaces compared with {111} to help CO oxidation by supplying oxygen and changing valence."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO reacting with the surface of ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. This completes the cycle. The presence of carbonate-like adsorbates as intermediates before CO2 desorption is a possibility, especially under cycled feedstream conditions. 

2. The stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100}. Formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces, requiring less energy.

3. This lower energy requirement allows for easier accommodation of CO reaction on {110} and {100} surfaces, contributing to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

4. The increase in specific rate value upon calcination is likely due to several physico-chemical modifications of the ceria crystallite surface.

5. Improved activity of CeO2 after calcination is attributed to the greater capacity of CeO2 {100}-type surfaces compared to {111} surfaces. These surfaces supply oxygen and facilitate the redox reaction, enhancing CO oxidation.

1. 氧化反应中，火星-范克里夫机制涉及CO与氧化铈表面反应形成氧空位，随后由气相氧补充完成循环。在循环进料条件下，可能存在碳酸盐类似吸附剂作为中间体，在CO2脱附之前。  

2. 在氧化铈立方结构的低指数平面中，稳定性遵循顺序{111}>{110}>{100}。在{110}和{100}表面上形成阴离子空位需要较少的能量。

3. 这种较低的能量需求使{110}和{100}表面上更容易容纳CO反应，从而促进氧化铈表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

4. 加热处理后特定速率值的增加可能归因于氧化铈晶粒表面的几种物理化学改性。

5. 加热处理后氧化铈的活性提高归因于{100}型表面相对于{111}表面的更大容量。这些表面提供氧气并促进红ox反应，增强CO氧化。
