[1] "In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."
[2] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100}, with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces."
[3] "Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."
[4] "The main consequence of this finding is that the redox reactivity of ceria (especially toward CO) might strongly depend on the type and amount of surfaces exposed to the gas phase."
[5] "Recently, it was demonstrated that nanorods preferentially exposing the unusually reactive {100} and {110} planes have a lower light-off temperature for CO oxidation than their counterpart irregular nanoparticles."

1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, CO reacts with the surface of ceria, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The cycle concludes with the formation and desorption of CO2.
2. According to the theoretical molecular mechanics method, the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure are ranked as {111} > {110} > {100}. This ranking indicates that it requires less energy to form anionic vacancies on the {110} and {100} surfaces.
3. Due to the lesser energy needed for vacancy formation on {110} and {100} surfaces, these surfaces are more receptive to CO reactions.
4. Consequently, the redox reactivity of ceria towards CO could significantly depend on the type and quantity of exposed surfaces in the gas phase.
5. It has been shown that nanorods that predominantly expose the unusually reactive {100} and {110} planes have a lower light-off temperature for CO oxidation compared to irregular nanoparticles.

1. 在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，CO与铈氧化物表面反应生成氧空位。然后，气相氧补充这个空位。循环结束时，形成并释放CO2。
2. 根据理论分子力学方法，铈氟立方结构中的三个低指数平面的稳定性顺序为{111}>{110}>{100}。这表明在{110}和{100}表面上形成阴离子空位所需的能量更少。
3. 由于在{110}和{100}表面上形成空位所需能量较少，这些表面更易于接受CO反应。
4. 因此，铈对CO的还原性可能显著依赖于暴露在气相中的表面类型和数量。
5. 最近发现，主要暴露在反应性极高的{100}和{110}平面上的纳米棒具有比不规则纳米颗粒更低的CO氧化起始温度。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a redox process. Carbon monoxide reacts with the surface ceria of the oxide, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy barrier affects how easily reactions occur and the efficiency of the oxidation process.

[1] "The oxidation of carbon monoxide over CeO2-based materials under aerobic and anaerobic conditions has been the subject of intense investigation in recent years [6,1619]."
[2] "It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism involves a redox Marsvan Krevelen-type reaction in which CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy,which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen."
[3] "Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle. The presence of carbonate-like adsorbates as intermediates before CO2 desorption is a possibility, especially under cycled feedstream conditions [3,6,20,21]."
[4] "In addition, it is also known that the ad- sorption behavior of CO on ceria surfaces is strongly related to the nature of the surfaces used in the experiments [25]; in particular, whereas only weak adsorption has been predicted for the {111}-type surface, both weak and strong adsorption is detected on the {110}-type surface, giving rise to carbon- ate formation."
[5] "The different reactivity of CO with exposed surfaces of ceria is also the result of the different stabilities of exposed planes."
[6] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100} [810,26], with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces."

[8] "The main consequence of this finding is that the redox reactivity of ceria (especially toward CO) might strongly depend on the type and amount of surfaces exposed to the gas phase."
[9] "Unfortunately,nanocrystalline ceria powders predominantly expose their least reactive {111} surfaces, and preparation of polycrys- talline materials with preferential exposure of specific reac- tive planes is very difficult."
[10] "Other factors that can positively influence specific activity on large ceria crystallites are also discussed."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO reacting with surface ceria, leading to the formation of an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower ΔEv are more reactive and facilitate CO oxidation more efficiently.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves CO reacting with surface ceria, resulting in the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for this process (ΔEv) influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates more reactive surfaces that enhance CO oxidation efficiency.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves CO reacting with the surface of ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. This completes the cycle. The presence of carbonate-like adsorbates as intermediates before CO2 desorption is a possibility, especially under cycled feedstream conditions. 

2. The stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100}. Formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces, requiring less energy.

3. This lower energy requirement allows for easier accommodation of CO reaction on {110} and {100} surfaces, contributing to the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

4. The increase in specific rate value upon calcination is likely due to several physico-chemical modifications of the ceria crystallite surface.

5. Improved activity of CeO2 after calcination is attributed to the greater capacity of CeO2 {100}-type surfaces compared to {111} surfaces. These surfaces supply oxygen and facilitate the redox reaction, enhancing CO oxidation.

1. 氧化反应中，火星-范克里夫机制涉及CO与氧化铈表面反应形成氧空位，随后由气相氧补充完成循环。在循环进料条件下，可能存在碳酸盐类似吸附剂作为中间体，在CO2脱附之前。  

2. 在氧化铈立方结构的低指数平面中，稳定性遵循顺序{111}>{110}>{100}。在{110}和{100}表面上形成阴离子空位需要较少的能量。

3. 这种较低的能量需求使{110}和{100}表面上更容易容纳CO反应，从而促进氧化铈表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

4. 加热处理后特定速率值的增加可能归因于氧化铈晶粒表面的几种物理化学改性。

5. 加热处理后氧化铈的活性提高归因于{100}型表面相对于{111}表面的更大容量。这些表面提供氧气并促进红ox反应，增强CO氧化。
