[1] "In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy, which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle."
[2] "It is known from the theoretical molecular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure follow the order {111} > {110} > {100}, with the consequence that formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100} surfaces."
[3] "Therefore, since less energy is required to form an oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to accommodate here reaction with CO."
[4] "The main consequence of this finding is that the redox reactivity of ceria (especially toward CO) might strongly depend on the type and amount of surfaces exposed to the gas phase."
[5] "Recently, it was demonstrated that nanorods preferentially exposing the unusually reactive {100} and {110} planes have a lower light-off temperature for CO oxidation than their counterpart irregular nanoparticles."

1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, CO reacts with the surface of ceria, creating an oxygen vacancy. This vacancy is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. The cycle concludes with the formation and desorption of CO2.
2. According to the theoretical molecular mechanics method, the stabilities of three low-index planes in the ceria fluorite cubic structure are ranked as {111} > {110} > {100}. This ranking indicates that it requires less energy to form anionic vacancies on the {110} and {100} surfaces.
3. Due to the lesser energy needed for vacancy formation on {110} and {100} surfaces, these surfaces are more receptive to CO reactions.
4. Consequently, the redox reactivity of ceria towards CO could significantly depend on the type and quantity of exposed surfaces in the gas phase.
5. It has been shown that nanorods that predominantly expose the unusually reactive {100} and {110} planes have a lower light-off temperature for CO oxidation compared to irregular nanoparticles.

1. 在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，CO与铈氧化物表面反应生成氧空位。然后，气相氧补充这个空位。循环结束时，形成并释放CO2。
2. 根据理论分子力学方法，铈氟立方结构中的三个低指数平面的稳定性顺序为{111}>{110}>{100}。这表明在{110}和{100}表面上形成阴离子空位所需的能量更少。
3. 由于在{110}和{100}表面上形成空位所需能量较少，这些表面更易于接受CO反应。
4. 因此，铈对CO的还原性可能显著依赖于暴露在气相中的表面类型和数量。
5. 最近发现，主要暴露在反应性极高的{100}和{110}平面上的纳米棒具有比不规则纳米颗粒更低的CO氧化起始温度。
