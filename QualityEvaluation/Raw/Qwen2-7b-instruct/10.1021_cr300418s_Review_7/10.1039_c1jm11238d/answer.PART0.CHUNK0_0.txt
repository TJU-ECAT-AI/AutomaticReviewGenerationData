[1] "The formation of localised reduced Ce3+ species upon removal of a neutral oxygen atom is well known and consistently described with the DFT + U approach."
[2] "The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8."
[3] "The PEDOS for the Ce 4f states in the Pd doped surfaces,plotted in Fig. 11(c) and (d), show the presence of reduced Ce3+ ions, which are manifested as peaks in the band gap between the valence band and the empty Ce 4f states."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism facilitates the transfer of electrons during oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies a more favorable environment for oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the oxidative capacity of the surface.

2. The most stable active oxygen vacancy site for both dopants, Pd and Ni, is an oxygen atom located on the surface that is not bonded to the dopant. This allows for easier removal of the oxygen atom, facilitating the creation of an active oxygen vacancy.

3. The PEDOS for the Ce 4f states in the Pd-doped surfaces demonstrates the presence of reduced Ce3+ ions. These ions manifest as peaks in the band gap between the valence band and the empty Ce 4f states, indicating the formation of localised reduced Ce3+ species upon the removal of a neutral oxygen atom.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中促进电子转移。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更有利于氧空位的形成，从而增强表面的氧化能力。

2. 两种掺杂剂Pd和Ni最稳定的活性氧空位位置是表面未与掺杂剂连接的氧原子。这使得氧原子更容易被移除，从而促进活性氧空位的生成。

3. 在Pd掺杂表面上的Ce 4f状态的投影电子密度图显示了还原态Ce3+离子的存在。这些离子在价带和空的Ce 4f状态之间形成峰，表明在去除中性氧原子后形成了局部化还原态Ce3+物种。
