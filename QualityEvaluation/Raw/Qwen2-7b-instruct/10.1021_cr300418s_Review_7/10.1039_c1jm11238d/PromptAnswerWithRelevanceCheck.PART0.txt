[1] "The formation of localised reduced Ce3+ species upon removal of a neutral oxygen atom is well known and consistently described with the DFT + U approach."
[2] "The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8."
[3] "The PEDOS for the Ce 4f states in the Pd doped surfaces,plotted in Fig. 11(c) and (d), show the presence of reduced Ce3+ ions, which are manifested as peaks in the band gap between the valence band and the empty Ce 4f states."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism facilitates the transfer of electrons during oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies a more favorable environment for oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the oxidative capacity of the surface.

2. The most stable active oxygen vacancy site for both dopants, Pd and Ni, is an oxygen atom located on the surface that is not bonded to the dopant. This allows for easier removal of the oxygen atom, facilitating the creation of an active oxygen vacancy.

3. The PEDOS for the Ce 4f states in the Pd-doped surfaces demonstrates the presence of reduced Ce3+ ions. These ions manifest as peaks in the band gap between the valence band and the empty Ce 4f states, indicating the formation of localised reduced Ce3+ species upon the removal of a neutral oxygen atom.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中促进电子转移。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更有利于氧空位的形成，从而增强表面的氧化能力。

2. 两种掺杂剂Pd和Ni最稳定的活性氧空位位置是表面未与掺杂剂连接的氧原子。这使得氧原子更容易被移除，从而促进活性氧空位的生成。

3. 在Pd掺杂表面上的Ce 4f状态的投影电子密度图显示了还原态Ce3+离子的存在。这些离子在价带和空的Ce 4f状态之间形成峰，表明在去除中性氧原子后形成了局部化还原态Ce3+物种。

The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove. Removal of an oxygen directly bonded to the dopant is much less favourable since that would destroy the square planar coordination environment of the dopant; an example of this is site III in the (111) surface and site II in the (100) surface, both of which have oxygen vacancy formation energies that are larger than in the undoped surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the formation of an active oxygen vacancy. This active oxygen vacancy facilitates the oxidation of reactants by allowing oxygen to participate in the reaction more readily. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more favorable condition for the formation of an active oxygen vacancy, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface. This is because a reduced ΔEv means that the oxide surface can more easily provide oxygen for the reaction, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness in the oxidation process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the oxidized surface species to molecular oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it signifies that oxygen vacancies are more readily available to participate in redox reactions. This makes the surface more reactive and capable of facilitating oxidation reactions, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. The reduction in ΔEv due to dopant incorporation, as seen in the case of Pd and Ni in ceria surfaces, makes oxygen vacancy formation more favorable, which in turn improves the surface's ability to oxidize reactants, indicating an increase in both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This supports the utility of Pd and Ni as dopants in ceria-based materials for catalytic applications, particularly for oxidation reactions and solid oxide fuel cells.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面物种与分子氧之间的电子转移而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。当ΔEv较低时，意味着氧空位更容易参与红ox反应。这使得表面更加活跃，能够促进氧化反应，从而增强催化活性。由于掺杂引入导致ΔEv降低，在铈基材料中的钯和镍表面观察到这种情况，使得氧空位形成更加有利，进而改善表面氧化反应剂的能力，表明催化活性和氧化能力的提高。这支持钯和镍作为铈基材料催化应用中的有用掺杂剂。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the oxygen vacancy to the reactant molecule, allowing the reactant to undergo oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the ease of formation of the oxygen vacancy, which in turn affects the availability of the oxygen vacancy for electron transfer. Lower ΔEv values indicate a more favorable condition for oxygen vacancy formation, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

[5] "For the Pd doped (111) surface,one Ce3+ is in the outermost Ce layer, while the second Ce3+ is found in the next atomic layer of Ce. In the (110) surface, both Ce3+ ions are found in the outermost surface layer."

1. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in ceria surfaces doped with Pd and Ni is significantly reduced compared to the undoped surfaces. For Pd in the (111) surface, the ΔEv is +1.32 eV, while for Pd in the (110) surface, it is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to substantial decreases in the ΔEv of the active oxygen vacancy.

2. Removing an oxygen atom directly bonded to the dopant is less favorable because it would disrupt the square planar coordination environment of the dopant. Examples of this are sites III in the (111) surface and site II in the (100) surface, which have higher ΔEv than the undoped surface.

3. The reduction in ΔEv is primarily due to the most stable active oxygen vacancy site being an oxygen atom on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant. This site, labeled as I in both surfaces depicted in Fig. 8, facilitates the release of electrons during the formation of an active oxygen vacancy.

4. The spin density and projected electronic density of states (PEDOS) for the Pd-doped (111) and (110) surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 11. This visualization reveals that two reduced Ce3+ ions are formed upon the removal of an active oxygen vacancy, indicating the redistribution of electrons.

5. In the Pd-doped (111) surface, one Ce3+ ion is located in the outermost Ce layer, while the second Ce3+ is found in the next atomic layer of Ce. In the (110) surface, both Ce3+ ions are situated in the outermost surface layer.

1. 在掺杂有钯和镍的铈氧化物表面中，活性氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）与未掺杂表面相比显著降低。在（111）表面上，钯的ΔEv为+1.32电子伏特，而在（110）表面上，该值为+1.36电子伏特。同样，镍掺杂导致活性氧空位形成能的显著下降。

2. 直接从掺杂原子上移除氧原子是不那么有利的，因为它会破坏掺杂原子的四面体配位环境。在（111）表面上的站点III和（100）表面上的站点II是例子，它们的ΔEv高于未掺杂表面。

3. ΔEv的减少主要归因于最稳定的活性氧空位位点是一个未与掺杂原子配位的表面氧原子。这个标记为I的站点，在图8所示的两个表面上，促进了活性氧空位形成时电子的释放。

4. 图11显示了钯掺杂的（111）和（110）表面上的自旋密度和投影电子密度图（PEDOS）。这揭示了在移除活性氧空位后，形成了两个局部化的Ce3+离子，表明电子的再分配。

5. 在钯掺杂的（111）表面上，一个Ce3+离子位于最外层的Ce层中，而第二个Ce3+离子则位于Ce层的下一层。在（110）表面上，两个Ce3+离子都位于最外层表面层中。
