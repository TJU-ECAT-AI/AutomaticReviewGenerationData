<p>The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove. Removal of an oxygen directly bonded to the dopant is much less favourable since that would destroy the square planar coordination environment of the dopant; an example of this is site III in the (111) surface and site II in the (110) surface, both of which have oxygen vacancy formation energies that are larger than in the undoped surface.</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the oxygen vacancy to the reactant molecule, allowing the reactant to undergo oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the ease of formation of the oxygen vacancy, which in turn affects the availability of the oxygen vacancy for electron transfer. Lower ΔEv values indicate a more favorable condition for oxygen vacancy formation, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过使氧空位向反应分子转移电子来起作用，从而使反应分子发生氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）很重要，因为它决定了氧空位形成的便利性，进而影响氧空位对电子转移的可用性。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位形成更为有利的条件，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
