The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove. Removal of an oxygen directly bonded to the dopant is much less favourable since that would destroy the square planar coordination environment of the dopant; an example of this is site III in the (111) surface and site II in the (100) surface, both of which have oxygen vacancy formation energies that are larger than in the undoped surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the formation of an active oxygen vacancy. This active oxygen vacancy facilitates the oxidation of reactants by allowing oxygen to participate in the reaction more readily. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more favorable condition for the formation of an active oxygen vacancy, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the surface. This is because a reduced ΔEv means that the oxide surface can more easily provide oxygen for the reaction, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness in the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成活性氧空位时释放的能量来操作。这个活性氧空位能够促进反应物的氧化，因为它使氧气更容易参与到反应中。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明活性氧空位形成更为有利的条件，从而增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为较低的ΔEv意味着氧化物表面可以更轻松地提供氧气以供反应使用，从而提高反应效率和效果。
