<p>The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface. For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only +1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the formation energy is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to significant reductions in the formation energy of the active oxygen vacancy.</p>
<p>The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce atoms, so it should be easier to remove. Removal of an oxygen directly bonded to the dopant is much less favourable since that would destroy the square planar coordination environment of the dopant; an example of this is site III in the (111) surface and site II in the (100) surface, both of which have oxygen vacancy formation energies that are larger than in the undoped surface.</p>
<p>The atomic structures of the most stable active oxygen vacancy structures are shown for each dopant in Fig. 9 for the (111) surface and in Fig. 10 for the (110) surface. In both CeO2 surfaces, Pd and Ni retain their preferred square planar coordination environment upon formation of the most stable active oxygen vacancy and the major changes are in the subsurface Ce ions, which are displaced off their lattice sites, consistent with formation of reduced Ce3+</p>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the oxidized surface species to molecular oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it signifies that oxygen vacancies are more readily available to participate in redox reactions. This makes the surface more reactive and capable of facilitating oxidation reactions, thus enhancing the catalytic activity. The reduction in ΔEv due to dopant incorporation, as seen in the case of Pd and Ni in ceria surfaces, makes oxygen vacancy formation more favorable, which in turn improves the surface's ability to oxidize reactants, indicating an increase in both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This supports the utility of Pd and Ni as dopants in ceria-based materials for catalytic applications, particularly for oxidation reactions and solid oxide fuel cells.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面物种与分子氧之间的电子转移而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。当ΔEv较低时，意味着氧空位更容易参与红ox反应。这使得表面更加活跃，能够促进氧化反应，从而增强催化活性。由于掺杂引入导致ΔEv降低，在铈基材料中的钯和镍表面观察到这种情况，使得氧空位形成更加有利，进而改善表面氧化反应剂的能力，表明催化活性和氧化能力的提高。这支持钯和镍作为铈基材料催化应用中的有用掺杂剂。
