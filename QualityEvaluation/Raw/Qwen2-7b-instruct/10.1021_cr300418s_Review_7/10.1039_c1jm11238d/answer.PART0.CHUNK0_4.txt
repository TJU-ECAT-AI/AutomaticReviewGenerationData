[1] "The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped surface. For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only +1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the formation energy is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to significant reductions in the formation energy of the active oxygen vacancy."
[2] "Removal of an oxygen directly bonded to the dopant is much less favourable since that would destroy the square planar coordination environment of the dopant; an example of this is site III in the (111) surface and site II in the (100) surface, both of which have oxygen vacancy formation energies that are larger than in the undoped surface."
[3] "The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces shown in Fig. 8."
[4] "The spin density (which allows visualisation of the destination of the two electrons released by formation of an active oxygen vacancy) and projected electronic density of states (PEDOS) are shown in Fig. 11 for the example of the Pd doped (111) and (110) surfaces."
[5] "For the Pd doped (111) surface,one Ce3+ is in the outermost Ce layer, while the second Ce3+ is found in the next atomic layer of Ce. In the (110) surface, both Ce3+ ions are found in the outermost surface layer."

1. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) in ceria surfaces doped with Pd and Ni is significantly reduced compared to the undoped surfaces. For Pd in the (111) surface, the ΔEv is +1.32 eV, while for Pd in the (110) surface, it is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to substantial decreases in the ΔEv of the active oxygen vacancy.

2. Removing an oxygen atom directly bonded to the dopant is less favorable because it would disrupt the square planar coordination environment of the dopant. Examples of this are sites III in the (111) surface and site II in the (100) surface, which have higher ΔEv than the undoped surface.

3. The reduction in ΔEv is primarily due to the most stable active oxygen vacancy site being an oxygen atom on the surface that is not coordinated to the dopant. This site, labeled as I in both surfaces depicted in Fig. 8, facilitates the release of electrons during the formation of an active oxygen vacancy.

4. The spin density and projected electronic density of states (PEDOS) for the Pd-doped (111) and (110) surfaces are illustrated in Fig. 11. This visualization reveals that two reduced Ce3+ ions are formed upon the removal of an active oxygen vacancy, indicating the redistribution of electrons.

5. In the Pd-doped (111) surface, one Ce3+ ion is located in the outermost Ce layer, while the second Ce3+ is found in the next atomic layer of Ce. In the (110) surface, both Ce3+ ions are situated in the outermost surface layer.

1. 在掺杂有钯和镍的铈氧化物表面中，活性氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）与未掺杂表面相比显著降低。在（111）表面上，钯的ΔEv为+1.32电子伏特，而在（110）表面上，该值为+1.36电子伏特。同样，镍掺杂导致活性氧空位形成能的显著下降。

2. 直接从掺杂原子上移除氧原子是不那么有利的，因为它会破坏掺杂原子的四面体配位环境。在（111）表面上的站点III和（100）表面上的站点II是例子，它们的ΔEv高于未掺杂表面。

3. ΔEv的减少主要归因于最稳定的活性氧空位位点是一个未与掺杂原子配位的表面氧原子。这个标记为I的站点，在图8所示的两个表面上，促进了活性氧空位形成时电子的释放。

4. 图11显示了钯掺杂的（111）和（110）表面上的自旋密度和投影电子密度图（PEDOS）。这揭示了在移除活性氧空位后，形成了两个局部化的Ce3+离子，表明电子的再分配。

5. 在钯掺杂的（111）表面上，一个Ce3+离子位于最外层的Ce层中，而第二个Ce3+离子则位于Ce层的下一层。在（110）表面上，两个Ce3+离子都位于最外层表面层中。
