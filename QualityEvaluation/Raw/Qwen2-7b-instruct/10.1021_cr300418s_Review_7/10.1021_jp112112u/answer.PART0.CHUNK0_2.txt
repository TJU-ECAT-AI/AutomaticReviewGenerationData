[1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2."
[2] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."
[3] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in bulk CeO2 is ca.4.5 eV."
[4] "However, the most stable defect, whether the oxygen hole polaron or the anion vacancy, depends on the ionic radius of the dopant."
[5] "Comparison of the DFT+U results will be made with the hybrid DFT for one dopant in the (2 × 2) surface cell."

1. Ceria is used as a catalyst in various chemical reactions, notably in the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO2).
2. Recent studies suggest that the process of oxygen vacancy healing by gas phase oxygen or nitrogen dioxide enhances CO oxidation, making the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy the decisive factor.
3. The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in pure ceria is approximately 4.5 electron volts (eV).
4. The stability of the defects in trivalent-doped ceria surfaces depends on the ionic radius of the dopant.
5. DFT+U calculations will be compared with hybrid DFT results for a single dopant in a (2 × 2) surface cell.

1. 氧化铈在各种化学反应中被用作催化剂，其中最重要的就是二氧化碳氧化碳（CO）。
2. 最近的研究表明，通过气体相氧或氮氧化物进行氧空位修复是有利的，因此初始氧空位的移除是决定性步骤。
3. 纯氧化铈中的氧空位形成能约为4.5电子伏特（eV）。
4. 氧化铈表面掺杂三价离子形成的缺陷稳定性取决于掺杂离子的半径。
5. 将对单个掺杂剂在（2 × 2）表面单元中的DFT+U计算结果与混合DFT结果进行比较。
