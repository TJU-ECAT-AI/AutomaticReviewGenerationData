The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves CO removing oxygen from the oxide surface during the CO oxidation to CO2 reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By enhancing the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria through trivalent metal cation doping, the CO oxidation efficiency can be improved. The specific energy for oxygen vacancy formation in bulk CeO2 is approximately 4.5 eV. Experimental studies have demonstrated that doping ceria with various metal cations can lead to higher oxygen vacancy formation energies and increased reactivity, thus enhancing CO oxidation. Density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) is commonly used to accurately describe the oxygen hole resulting from trivalent doping of CeO2, and this method has also been applied to other materials such as Li-doped MgO and Al-doped SiO2.

火星-范克雷伦机制涉及CO从氧化物表面去除氧，从而实现CO氧化为CO2反应。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。通过三价金属离子掺杂增强铈氧化物的氧空位形成能和活性，可以提高CO氧化效率。在铈基体中，氧空位形成的能量约为4.5电子伏特。实验研究表明，通过各种三价金属离子掺杂铈氧化物可以增加氧空位形成能和活性，从而增强CO氧化。密度泛函理论修正了本征库仑相互作用（DFT+U）通常用于准确描述三价掺杂铈氧化物产生的氧空位，并且这种方法也被应用于其他材料，如锂掺杂的镁氧化物和铝掺杂的二氧化硅。
