[1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2."
[2] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."
[3] "In common with other studies on ceria, we use density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U), where UCe4f = 5 eV and is applied to the Ce 4f states and, in addition, for oxygen, UO2p = 7 eV and is applied to the O 2p states."
[4] "For Al3+, Sc3+, and In3+, because the computed formation energies are negative, this does indicate that spontaneous formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy can occur."
[5] "In our previous work, (43, 45) we suggested that the results for La-doped CeO2 can be best understood by considering the nature of the host oxide: cerium is more easily reduced compared with the cations above, and formation of an oxygen vacancy resulting in formation of reduced Ce3+ is quite favorable."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by allowing CO to remove oxygen from the oxide surface. The oxygen is then replenished in some way, regenerating the catalyst. The key factor in enhancing the formation of CO2 from CO is making the oxygen vacancy formation energy more favorable, thus improving the catalyst's activity and oxidizing ability.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Favorable ΔEv facilitates the regeneration of the catalyst and enhances the reaction rate, indicating a higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

3. Density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) is used to study the defects formed when the ceria surface is doped with trivalent ions. This method allows for accurate description of the electronic structure and energetics involved in the doping process.

4. For Al3+, Sc3+, and In3+, the negative formation energies for the compensating oxygen vacancy suggest that spontaneous formation of the oxygen vacancy occurs. This compensates for the dopants and stabilizes the system.

5. In the case of La-doped CeO2, the results can be best explained by considering the ease of reduction of cerium compared to other cations. This leads to the formation of an oxygen vacancy that reduces one Ce4+ ion to Ce3+, which is more favorable energetically than compensating both oxygen holes as seen in other oxides.

1. 在氧化反应中，火星-范克雷维尔机制通过允许CO从氧化物表面去除氧来操作。氧随后以某种方式得到补充，从而再生催化剂。使氧空位形成能更有利于的条件可以增强CO转化为CO2的反应速率，从而提高催化剂的活性和氧化能力。

2. 氧空位形成能（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。有利的ΔEv有助于催化剂的再生并增强反应速率，表明更高的催化活性和氧化能力。

3. 使用密度泛函理论（DFT）修正为本征库仑相互作用（DFT+U）来研究当铈表面被三价离子掺杂时形成的缺陷。这种方法允许准确描述电子结构和掺杂过程中的能量效应。

4. 对于Al3+、Sc3+和In3+，负的补偿氧空位形成能表明自发形成氧空位发生。这补偿了掺杂剂并稳定了系统。

5. 对于镧掺杂的铈氧化物，结果可以通过考虑铈的易还原性来最好地解释与其他阳离子相比。这导致形成一个氧空位，该空位将一个Ce4+离子还原为Ce3+，这在能量上比补偿两个氧孔更为有利，这是与其他氧化物所见的不同。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is a key process in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, particularly CO oxidation to CO2. This mechanism involves CO removing oxygen from the oxide surface. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A more favorable oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the oxidation of CO. Recent studies suggest that healing the oxygen vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is a favorable step in this process, indicating that the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy is the determining factor. In bulk CeO2, the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy is approximately 4.5 eV. Calculations on the low index surfaces of ceria show significantly lower oxygen vacancy formation energies, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity on these surfaces. The research conducted uses DFT+U and HSE06 functional to study defects formed when the ceria (110) surface is doped with trivalent dopants, aiming to understand their impact on the oxygen vacancy formation and thus the catalytic performance.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves CO removing oxygen from the oxide surface during the CO oxidation to CO2 reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By enhancing the oxygen vacancy formation energy and reactivity of ceria through trivalent metal cation doping, the CO oxidation efficiency can be improved. The specific energy for oxygen vacancy formation in bulk CeO2 is approximately 4.5 eV. Experimental studies have demonstrated that doping ceria with various metal cations can lead to higher oxygen vacancy formation energies and increased reactivity, thus enhancing CO oxidation. Density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) is commonly used to accurately describe the oxygen hole resulting from trivalent doping of CeO2, and this method has also been applied to other materials such as Li-doped MgO and Al-doped SiO2.
