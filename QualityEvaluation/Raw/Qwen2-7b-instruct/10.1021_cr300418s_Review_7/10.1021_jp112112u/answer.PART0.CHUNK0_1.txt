The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is a key process in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, particularly CO oxidation to CO2. This mechanism involves CO removing oxygen from the oxide surface. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A more favorable oxygen vacancy formation energy enhances the oxidation of CO. Recent studies suggest that healing the oxygen vacancy with gas phase oxygen or NO2 is a favorable step in this process, indicating that the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy is the determining factor. In bulk CeO2, the formation energy of an oxygen vacancy is approximately 4.5 eV. Calculations on the low index surfaces of ceria show significantly lower oxygen vacancy formation energies, suggesting enhanced catalytic activity on these surfaces. The research conducted uses DFT+U and HSE06 functional to study defects formed when the ceria (110) surface is doped with trivalent dopants, aiming to understand their impact on the oxygen vacancy formation and thus the catalytic performance.

火星-范克瑞伦机制是氧化物催化氧化反应的关键过程，特别是在CO氧化为CO2的过程中。该机制涉及CO从氧化物表面去除氧。氧空位形成能（ΔEv）的必要性对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更有利于氧空位形成的能量增强CO的氧化。最近的研究表明，使用气体相氧或NO2修复氧空位是这一过程的一个有利步骤，这意味着初始去除氧空位是决定性的步骤。在CeO2中，氧空位的形成能约为4.5 eV。对铈化物低指数表面的计算显示氧空位形成能显著降低，这表明这些表面上的催化活性增强。研究使用DFT+U和HSE06功能来研究当铈化物（110）表面被三价掺杂剂掺杂时形成的缺陷，旨在了解这些缺陷对氧空位形成及其对催化性能的影响。
