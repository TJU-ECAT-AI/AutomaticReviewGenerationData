[1] "A large number of chemical reactions have been studied with ceria as the catalyst, key among these being CO oxidation to CO2."
[2] "The OSC is facilitated by the ease with which Ce can change its oxidation state from 4+ in CeO2 to 3+ in reduced ceria (with full reduction yielding Ce2O3) through formation of oxygen vacancies."
[3] "Recent work indicates that healing of the vacancy with gas phase oxygen (11, 17) or with NO2 (18, 19) is favorable so that the determining step is the initial removal of the oxygen vacancy."
[4] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in bulk CeO2 is ca.4.5 eV."
[5] "In that work, density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT+U) was applied to Ce, which is a standard approach (47, 48) that has been applied in many papers, (10-12, 14, 17, 18, 20, 23-26, 35-45, 49, 50) but also to the O 2p states in order to correctly describe the oxygen hole that results upon trivalent doping of CeO2; (43, 45)"
[6] "Comparison of the DFT+U results will be made with the hybrid DFT for one dopant in the (2 × 2) surface cell."
[7] "The formation energy of an oxygen vacancy in doped ceria is given by (1) with the dopant and vacancy concentrations calculated from the subscripts on the dopant, M, and O in eq 1."
[8] "The electronic density of states projected onto the Ce 4f and O 2p states of doped ceria (PEDOS) are plotted in Figures 4 and 5 for the examples of Al3+ and Y3+ doping, respectively."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by allowing CO to remove oxygen from the oxide surface. This oxygen is then replenished through various means, such as gas phase oxygen or NO2, which enhances the oxidation of CO to CO2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it affects the efficiency of oxygen supply and removal in the reaction.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过允许CO从氧化物表面移除氧来运作。然后，通过各种方式，如气体相氧或NO2来补充氧，这增强了CO氧化为CO2。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为它影响反应中氧的供给和移除的效率。
