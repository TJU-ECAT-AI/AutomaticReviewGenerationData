The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies formed during the reaction process. These vacancies facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, enhancing the catalytic activity of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, which could lead to increased catalytic efficiency and stronger oxidizing capability. However, the precise relationship between ΔEv and these properties depends on various factors, including the specific oxide material, its crystal structure, and the nature of the reaction taking place.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成期间在表面产生的氧空位来操作。这些空位促进了反应物分子的吸附和活化，增强了氧化物表面的催化活性。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着氧空位的形成更为能量有利，这可能导致催化效率的提高和更强的氧化能力。然而，ΔEv与这些性质之间的精确关系取决于多种因素，包括特定的氧化物材料、其晶体结构以及进行的反应类型。
