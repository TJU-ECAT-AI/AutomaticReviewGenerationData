          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies formed during the reaction process. These vacancies facilitate the adsorption and activation of reactant molecules, enhancing the catalytic activity of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies, which could lead to increased catalytic efficiency and stronger oxidizing capability.

          In reduced oxide systems, the formation of oxygen vacancies leads to the creation of electron-rich sites on the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can lead to enhanced catalytic performance due to the availability of electron-rich sites for reaction coordination and activation.
