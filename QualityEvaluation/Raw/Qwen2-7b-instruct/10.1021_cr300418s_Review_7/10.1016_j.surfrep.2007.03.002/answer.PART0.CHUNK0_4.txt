[1] "Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety of technological applications."
[2] "Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide systems."
[3] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. The ΔEv plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it influences the surface's reactivity and the efficiency of the oxidation process. Higher ΔEv typically indicates greater catalytic activity and oxidizing power, facilitating more effective oxidation reactions.
