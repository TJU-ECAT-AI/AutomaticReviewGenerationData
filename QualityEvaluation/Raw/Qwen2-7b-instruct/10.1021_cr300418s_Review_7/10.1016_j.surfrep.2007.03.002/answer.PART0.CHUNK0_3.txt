[1] "Defects at transition metal (TM) and rare earth (RE) oxide surfaces, neutral oxygen vacancies in particular, play a major role in a variety of technological applications."
[2] "Special attention is given to the fate of the electrons left in the system upon vacancy formation and the ability of state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to provide reliable energies and an accurate description of the electronic structure of the partially reduced oxide systems."
[3] "In reduced oxide systems, the formation of oxygen vacancies leads to the creation of electron-rich sites on the surface."
[4] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the oxidation of reactants to drive the reaction forward. In this mechanism, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can lead to enhanced catalytic performance due to the availability of electron-rich sites for reaction coordination and activation.

火星-范克列伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用反应物氧化释放的能量来推动反应进行。在这种机制下，氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表示氧空位更稳定，这可以导致增强的催化性能，因为存在电子丰富的位点用于反应协调和激活。
