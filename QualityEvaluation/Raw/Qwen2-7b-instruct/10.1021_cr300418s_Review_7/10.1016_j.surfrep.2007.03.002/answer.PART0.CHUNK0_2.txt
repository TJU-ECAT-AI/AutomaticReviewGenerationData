The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies in the oxide surface. These vacancies serve as active sites for the adsorption of reactants and facilitate the transfer of electrons, which is essential for the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable vacancy, enhancing the surface's ability to catalyze oxidation reactions efficiently. This energy barrier also affects the reactivity of the surface towards various substrates, thus impacting the overall performance of the oxide catalyst.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面的氧空位起作用。这些空位作为反应物吸附的活性位点，并促进电子转移，这对于氧化过程至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。ΔEv较低表示空位更稳定，从而增强表面催化氧化反应的能力。该能量壁垒也影响表面对各种基质的反应性，从而影响氧化物催化剂的整体性能。
