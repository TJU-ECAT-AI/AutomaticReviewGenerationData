[1] "Density functional theory calculations show that BEP relations also exist for oxides and that they have a richly detailed structure."
[2] "Among the molecules and oxides investigated in this study, one finds the whole spectrum of BEP relations with slopes from one to almost zero."
[3] "A slope equal to zero corresponds to a system with no activation barrier and hence the ETS by definition is not a well defined quantity."
[4] "Surprisingly, we have found that the BEP relations for molecules with strong intramolecular bonds on the most stable site on rutiles follow a relation that almost coincides with the dissociation line."
[5] "This suggests that these oxides are interesting as alternative catalysts for reactions involving the dissociation of diatomic molecules compared to transition metals."
[6] "The perovskites could also be interesting for some reactions, since with respect to their dissociative abilities they intrinsically resemble the steps on transition metals."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the context of this literature, the ΔEv plays a crucial role in facilitating the dissociation of diatomic molecules on oxide surfaces. Specifically, for molecules with strong intramolecular bonds on the most stable site on rutiles, the BEP relations closely align with the dissociation line, indicating that these oxides might serve as alternative catalysts for reactions involving the dissociation of diatomic molecules compared to transition metals. Perovskites, on the other hand, exhibit dissociative abilities that closely mimic those of transition metals, making them potentially interesting for reactions that require high oxidizing power.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。根据本文档的内容，ΔEv在促进双原子分子在氧化物表面的解离方面起着关键作用。具体而言，在最稳定的rutile表面，具有强内键的分子的BEP关系与解离线非常接近，这表明这些氧化物可能作为与过渡金属相比，用于涉及双原子分子解离的反应的替代催化剂。钙钛矿表现出与过渡金属相似的解离能力，因此它们对于需要高氧化性的反应可能是有趣的。
