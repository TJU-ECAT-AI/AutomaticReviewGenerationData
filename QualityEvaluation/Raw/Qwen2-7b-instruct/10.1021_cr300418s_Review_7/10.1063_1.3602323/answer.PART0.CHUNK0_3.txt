[2] "Density functional theory calculations show that BEP relations also exist for oxides and that they have a richly detailed structure."
[3] "Among the molecules and oxides investigated in this study, one finds the whole spectrum of BEP relations with slopes from one to almost zero."
[4] "A slope equal to zero corresponds to a system with no activation barrier and hence the ETS by definition is not a well defined quantity."
[5] "Surprisingly, we have found that the BEP relations for molecules with strong intramolecular bonds on the most stable site on rutiles follow a relation that almost coincides with the dissociation line."
[6] "This suggests that these oxides are interesting as alternative catalysts for reactions involving the dissociation of diatomic molecules compared to transition metals."
[7] "The perovskites could also be interesting for some reactions, since with respect to their dissociative abilities they intrinsically resemble the steps on transition metals."
[8] "Our results show that if the underlying nature of bonding in the TS and the dissociated state are similar, that is the TS is FS-like, these are correlated via a BEP relation with a slope close to unity."
[9] "On the other hand, if the TS is more IS-like the BEP relations become FS-independent and the dissociative chemisorption energy becomes an invalid descriptor for the dissociation barrier."
[10] "This is the case for very reactive surfaces or molecules with weak intramolecular bonds."
[11] "We have identified a cyclic behavior in the TS character, that is it can change from being FS to IS and back to FS as the metal constituent of the oxide is varied through a period in the periodic table."
[12] "This implies that on a detailed level the concept of universal BEP relation is an insufficient model unable to take into account the fine-structure observed in this study."
[13] "It is also found that, for a given molecule and active site, the BEP relation is a continuous function that depends on the strength of the bond formed between the surface and the molecule."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy plays a crucial role in the reactivity of the surface. The document reveals that BEP relations, which connect activation energies to reaction energies or transition state energies to dissociative chemisorption energies, exist for a variety of transition metal oxides. These oxides, particularly rutiles and perovskites, demonstrate diverse behaviors depending on the dissociating molecule and the active site. The slope of the BEP relation varies, reflecting the interplay between the type of molecule and the electronic structure of the active site in the TS configuration. The study identifies that the BEP relations are highly dependent on the dissociating molecule and the reactivity of the surface, indicating that the concept of a universal BEP relation is insufficient to capture the fine-structure behavior observed in the study. Additionally, the document notes the cyclic behavior of the TS character across different metal constituents of the oxide, suggesting that the TS transitions from FS-like to IS-like and back to FS-like as the metal constituent is varied through a period in the periodic table.

The ΔEv is critical in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface because it influences the energy barrier for the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are key in facilitating the oxidation process. Higher ΔEv typically correlates with greater catalytic activity and oxidizing power, as it facilitates easier formation and movement of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's ability to oxidize substrates efficiently. The study further elucidates that the nature of bonding in the TS and the dissociated state significantly affects the BEP relations. When these states share similar bonding characteristics, the BEP relations exhibit slopes close to unity, indicating a strong correlation between the TS energy and the dissociative chemisorption energy. Conversely, when the TS exhibits more initial state (IS)-like characteristics, the BEP relations become insensitive to the dissociative chemisorption energy, making it an inadequate descriptor for the dissociation barrier. This finding highlights the complexity of oxide-catalyzed reactions and underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms.

In conclusion, the ΔEv plays a pivotal role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces, while the BEP relations provide insights into the reactivity patterns of these materials. The cyclic behavior of the TS character across different metal constituents of the oxide adds another layer of complexity, emphasizing the need for a detailed, rather than universal, description of these phenomena.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这种能量对于反应的活性至关重要。文档揭示了氧化物，尤其是二氧化钛和钙钛矿，存在一系列BEP关系，这些关系连接激活能与反应能或过渡态能量与解离吸附能之间的关系。这些氧化物，特别是二氧化钛和钙钛矿，根据分离分子和活性位点的不同，表现出不同的行为。BEP关系的斜率各不相同，反映了分子类型和活性位点的电子结构在TS配置中的相互作用。研究发现，BEP关系高度依赖于分离分子和表面的反应性，表明通用BEP关系不足以捕捉研究中观察到的精细结构。此外，文档指出TS性质呈现出周期表中不同金属组分氧化物的循环行为，表明随着金属组分的变化，TS从FS-like转变为IS-like再回到FS-like。

ΔEv在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用，因为它影响形成氧空位的能量壁垒，而氧空位是促进氧化过程的关键。较高的ΔEv通常与更高的催化活性和氧化能力相关联，因为它使更容易形成和移动氧空位，从而增强表面有效氧化底物的能力。研究进一步阐明了TS和解离状态之间的结合特性对BEP关系的影响。当这两个状态具有相似的结合特性时，BEP关系显示接近单位的斜率，表明TS能量和解离吸附能量之间存在强烈的相关性。相反，当TS表现出更多的初始状态(IS)-like特性时，BEP关系变得对解离吸附能量不敏感，使其无法作为描述解离障碍的合适描述符。这一发现强调了氧化物催化的反应的复杂性，并强调了深入了解这些现象背后的机制的必要性。

综上所述，ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着至关重要的作用，而BEP关系提供了这些材料反应活性模式的见解。氧化物表面TS性质随金属组分的周期性变化增加了另一层复杂性，强调了需要详细描述而不是通用描述这些现象的必要性。
