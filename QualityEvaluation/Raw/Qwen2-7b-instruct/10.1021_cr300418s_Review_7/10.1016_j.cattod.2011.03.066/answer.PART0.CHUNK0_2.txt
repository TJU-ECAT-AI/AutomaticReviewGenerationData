An Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst was activated by pulses of CO, and the effects of the formed oxygen vacancy and carbonates on CO oxidation were studied by a pulse calorimetry.
A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained. However, the activity decreases with further increase of oxygen vacancy.
Quantitative analysis of the reaction process suggests that the increase of oxygen vacancy promotes the buildup of strongly adsorbed carbonates, leading to the prohibition of the adsorption and activation of CO but not O2. The reduced supply of adsorbed CO to react with oxygen species may result in the decreasing activity with more oxygen vacancy.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A volcano-like relationship exists between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity. Initially, the presence of oxygen vacancy is beneficial for CO oxidation, with optimal activity observed at approximately 1.5% oxygen vacancy content. However, further increases in oxygen vacancy lead to a decrease in activity. This decrease is attributed to the promotion of the buildup of strongly adsorbed carbonates, which inhibits the adsorption and activation of CO but not O2. Consequently, the reduced supply of adsorbed CO to react with oxygen species results in a decline in activity as the amount of oxygen vacancy increases.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（Ov）来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。在氧化物表面形成氧空位与催化剂活性之间存在火山状的关系。最初，氧空位的存在对CO氧化有益，最佳活性出现在大约1.5%氧空位含量时。然而，氧空位含量的进一步增加会导致活性下降。这种下降归因于强烈吸附碳酸盐的形成促进，这抑制了CO的吸附和活化但不O2。因此，吸附CO供应减少，无法与氧物种反应，导致随着氧空位量增加活性下降。
