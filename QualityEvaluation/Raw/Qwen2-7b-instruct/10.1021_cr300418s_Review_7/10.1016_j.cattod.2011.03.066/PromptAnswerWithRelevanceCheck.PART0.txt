[1] "The reversible formation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) on the activated ceria was thought to operate in its catalytic cycle."
[2] "The catalysts with noble metal (NM) encapsulated by ceria can still behave a high activity even without the direct participation of the NM."
[3] "It has been proposed that the addition of NM weakened the surface CeO bond strength and promoted the formation of Ov, which became the active sites."
[4] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2."
[5] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov."
[6] "In this study, we investigated the influence of CO pretreatment on this Ir-in-CeO2 sample."
[7] "With pretreatment by pulses of CO, different amounts of Ov and carbonates were obtained and their effects on CO oxidation were in turn studied."
[8] "A volcano-like relationship between Ov and the activity of CO oxidation was established, the reasons of which were then investigated by analysis of the transient process during CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. When a noble metal (NM) is encapsulated within a ceria-based catalyst, the addition of NM weakens the surface CeO bond strength, promoting the formation of Ov, which becomes an active site for the reaction. The formation of Ov is crucial as it facilitates the activation of O2, enabling CO to react with these active oxygen species. This reaction often results in the production of carbonates, acting either as a reaction intermediate or as a spectator species, depending on the presence of Ov. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the study, the influence of CO pretreatment on an Ir-in-CeO2 sample was investigated. Different amounts of Ov and carbonates were obtained through CO pretreatment, and their effects on CO oxidation were studied. A volcano-like relationship between Ov and CO oxidation activity was established, and the reasons for this relationship were explored through the analysis of the transient process during CO oxidation.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧化空位（Ov）在氧化物催化剂表面的形成。当将一种贵金属（NM）封装在铈基催化剂中时，NM的添加会削弱CeO表面的键强度，促进Ov的形成，使其成为反应的活性位点。Ov的形成对于激活O2至关重要，使CO能够与这些活性氧物种反应。这种反应通常导致碳酸盐的产生，作为反应中间体或在Ov存在的稳定物种，具体取决于反应过程。能量需求（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着重要作用。在研究中，对含铱的CeO2样品进行了CO预处理的影响进行了调查。通过CO预处理获得了不同量的Ov和碳酸盐，并研究了它们对CO氧化的影响。建立了Ov与CO氧化活性之间的火山状关系，并通过分析CO氧化过程中的瞬态过程来探索这种关系的原因。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. When oxygen is removed from the oxide surface, oxygen vacancies are created, which can then act as active sites for the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more efficient conversion of oxygen, leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability. This is because the lower energy barrier facilitates the activation of reactants and the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are essential for the oxidation reactions to proceed effectively.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（Ov）来运行。当氧气从氧化物表面被移除时，会在氧化物表面上产生氧空位，这些氧空位可以作为氧化过程中的活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更有效的氧气转换，导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。这是因为较低的能量壁垒有助于激活反应物并形成活性氧物种，这对于氧化反应的有效进行至关重要。

An Ir-in-CeO2 catalyst was activated by pulses of CO, and the effects of the formed oxygen vacancy and carbonates on CO oxidation were studied by a pulse calorimetry.
A volcano-like relationship between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity is established. The presence of oxygen vacancy is favorable for CO oxidation, with the best activity when 1.5% amount of oxygen vacancy is obtained. However, the activity decreases with further increase of oxygen vacancy.
Quantitative analysis of the reaction process suggests that the increase of oxygen vacancy promotes the buildup of strongly adsorbed carbonates, leading to the prohibition of the adsorption and activation of CO but not O2. The reduced supply of adsorbed CO to react with oxygen species may result in the decreasing activity with more oxygen vacancy.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A volcano-like relationship exists between the amount of oxygen vacancy and the catalyst activity. Initially, the presence of oxygen vacancy is beneficial for CO oxidation, with optimal activity observed at approximately 1.5% oxygen vacancy content. However, further increases in oxygen vacancy lead to a decrease in activity. This decrease is attributed to the promotion of the buildup of strongly adsorbed carbonates, which inhibits the adsorption and activation of CO but not O2. Consequently, the reduced supply of adsorbed CO to react with oxygen species results in a decline in activity as the amount of oxygen vacancy increases.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位（Ov）来运行。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。在氧化物表面形成氧空位与催化剂活性之间存在火山状的关系。最初，氧空位的存在对CO氧化有益，最佳活性出现在大约1.5%氧空位含量时。然而，氧空位含量的进一步增加会导致活性下降。这种下降归因于强烈吸附碳酸盐的形成促进，这抑制了CO的吸附和活化但不O2。因此，吸附CO供应减少，无法与氧物种反应，导致随着氧空位量增加活性下降。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of reactants, their activation by the presence of reactive oxygen species on the oxide surface, followed by a reaction, and the subsequent desorption of products. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its impact on both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more facile creation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the availability of reactive oxygen species and thus improve the catalyst's performance. However, there exists an optimal level of oxygen vacancies; beyond this point, excessive vacancies may lead to a decrease in activity due to a shift in the balance of surface chemistry towards less effective reaction pathways.
