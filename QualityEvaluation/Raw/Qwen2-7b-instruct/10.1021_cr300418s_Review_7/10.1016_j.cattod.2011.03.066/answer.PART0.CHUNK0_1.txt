[1] "The reversible formation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) on the activated ceria was thought to operate in its catalytic cycle."
[2] "It has been proposed that the addition of NM weakened the surface CeO bond strength and promoted the formation of Ov, which became the active sites."
[3] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation."
[4] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2."
[5] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov."
[6] "In this study, we investigated the influence of CO pretreatment on this Ir-in-CeO2 sample."
[7] "With pretreatment by pulses of CO, different amounts of Ov and carbonates were obtained and their effects on CO oxidation were in turn studied."
[8] "A volcano-like relationship between Ov and the activity of CO oxidation was established, the reasons of which were then investigated by analysis of the transient process during CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. When oxygen is removed from the oxide surface, oxygen vacancies are created, which can then act as active sites for the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more efficient conversion of oxygen, leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing ability. This is because the lower energy barrier facilitates the activation of reactants and the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are essential for the oxidation reactions to proceed effectively.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（Ov）来运行。当氧气从氧化物表面被移除时，会在氧化物表面上产生氧空位，这些氧空位可以作为氧化过程中的活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更有效的氧气转换，导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。这是因为较低的能量壁垒有助于激活反应物并形成活性氧物种，这对于氧化反应的有效进行至关重要。
