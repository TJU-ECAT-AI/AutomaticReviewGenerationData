[1] "Recently,a debate about the role of ceria in CO oxidation is ongoing."
[2] "The reversible formation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) on the activated ceria was thought to operate in its catalytic cycle."
[3] "The catalysts with noble metal (NM) encapsulated by ceria can still behave a high activity even without the direct participation of the NM."
[4] "It has been proposed that the addition of NM weakened the surface CeO bond strength and promoted the formation of Ov, which became the active sites."
[5] "Reactive oxygen removal from ceria with formation of Ov is a well-known step during CO oxidation, concomitant with the transient CO2 formation."
[6] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2."
[7] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov."
[8] "However, there were few studies to quantify the amount of Ov of ceria-based catalysts and further correlate it with the activity of CO oxidation."
[9] "In this study, we investigated the influence of CO pretreatment on this Ir-in-CeO2 sample."
[10] "With pretreatment by pulses of CO, different amounts of Ov and carbonates were obtained and their effects on CO oxidation were in turn studied."
[11] "A volcano-like relationship between Ov and the activity of CO oxidation was established, the reasons of which were then investigated by analysis of the transient process during CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of reactants, their activation by the presence of reactive oxygen species on the oxide surface, followed by a reaction, and the subsequent desorption of products. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its impact on both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a more facile creation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the availability of reactive oxygen species and thus improve the catalyst's performance. However, there exists an optimal level of oxygen vacancies; beyond this point, excessive vacancies may lead to a decrease in activity due to a shift in the balance of surface chemistry towards less effective reaction pathways.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤进行操作，包括吸附反应物、通过氧化物表面的活性氧物种激活它们，随后进行反应，最后产品脱附。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）的重要性在于它对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力的影响。较低的ΔEv通常意味着更容易产生氧空位，这可以增强活性氧物种的可用性，从而提高催化剂的性能。然而，存在一个最优的氧空位水平；超过这一点，过多的空位可能导致活性下降，因为表面化学平衡向效率较低的反应途径倾斜。
