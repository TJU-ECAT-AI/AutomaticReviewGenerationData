[1] "The reversible formation of oxygen vacancy (Ov) on the activated ceria was thought to operate in its catalytic cycle."
[2] "The catalysts with noble metal (NM) encapsulated by ceria can still behave a high activity even without the direct participation of the NM."
[3] "It has been proposed that the addition of NM weakened the surface CeO bond strength and promoted the formation of Ov, which became the active sites."
[4] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2."
[5] "It was suggested that CO can react with these active oxygen species to produce carbonates, which would affect CO oxidation, either as a reaction-intermediate or as a spectator staying steady in the presence of Ov."
[6] "In this study, we investigated the influence of CO pretreatment on this Ir-in-CeO2 sample."
[7] "With pretreatment by pulses of CO, different amounts of Ov and carbonates were obtained and their effects on CO oxidation were in turn studied."
[8] "A volcano-like relationship between Ov and the activity of CO oxidation was established, the reasons of which were then investigated by analysis of the transient process during CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. When a noble metal (NM) is encapsulated within a ceria-based catalyst, the addition of NM weakens the surface CeO bond strength, promoting the formation of Ov, which becomes an active site for the reaction. The formation of Ov is crucial as it facilitates the activation of O2, enabling CO to react with these active oxygen species. This reaction often results in the production of carbonates, acting either as a reaction intermediate or as a spectator species, depending on the presence of Ov. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the study, the influence of CO pretreatment on an Ir-in-CeO2 sample was investigated. Different amounts of Ov and carbonates were obtained through CO pretreatment, and their effects on CO oxidation were studied. A volcano-like relationship between Ov and CO oxidation activity was established, and the reasons for this relationship were explored through the analysis of the transient process during CO oxidation.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧化空位（Ov）在氧化物催化剂表面的形成。当将一种贵金属（NM）封装在铈基催化剂中时，NM的添加会削弱CeO表面的键强度，促进Ov的形成，使其成为反应的活性位点。Ov的形成对于激活O2至关重要，使CO能够与这些活性氧物种反应。这种反应通常导致碳酸盐的产生，作为反应中间体或在Ov存在的稳定物种，具体取决于反应过程。能量需求（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着重要作用。在研究中，对含铱的CeO2样品进行了CO预处理的影响进行了调查。通过CO预处理获得了不同量的Ov和碳酸盐，并研究了它们对CO氧化的影响。建立了Ov与CO氧化活性之间的火山状关系，并通过分析CO氧化过程中的瞬态过程来探索这种关系的原因。
