[1] "Recently, a debate about the role of ceria in CO oxidation is ongoing."
[2] "It has been proposed that the addition of NM weakened the surface CeO bond strength and promoted the formation of Ov, which became the active sites."
[3] "The presence of Ov was generally helpful for the activation of O2."
[4] "However, there were few studies to quantify the amount of Ov of ceria-based catalysts and further correlate it with the activity of CO oxidation."
[5] "Our previous work has suggested that CO oxidation progressed on the activated ceria of an Ir-in-CeO2 sample (most of iridium encapsulated by ceria) and reductive pretreatment increased its activity, indicating the important role of Ov."
[6] "In this study, we investigated the influence of CO pretreatment on this Ir-in-CeO2 sample."
[7] "With pretreatment by pulses of CO, different amounts of Ov and carbonates were obtained and their effects on CO oxidation were in turn studied."
[8] "A volcano-like relationship between Ov and the activity of CO oxidation was established, the reasons of which were then investigated by analysis of the transient process during CO oxidation."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and subsequent oxidation of hydroperoxyl radicals. These radicals are produced through the sequential reactions of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen, followed by their oxidation to water and oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it influences the surface's reactivity and stability.

1. 汤斯-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过生成并随后氧化氢过氧基自由基来运作。这些自由基是通过过氧化氢和氧气的序列反应产生的，随后它们被氧化为水和氧气。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用，因为它影响表面的反应性和稳定性。
