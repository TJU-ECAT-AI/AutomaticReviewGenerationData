[1] "The redox processes occurring on ceria and Rh on ceria catalyst have been monitored by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Ce LIII edge using a fast collection mode of the data."
[2] "The influence of the ceria surface area and the effect of rhodium are investigated in detail."
[3] "The reduction starts on the surface through successive hydrogen dissociation and anionic vacancy formation, followed by a much slower bulk diffusion step."
[4] "On Rh/CeOz sample the surface reduction becomes very fast, due to the faster hydrogen dissociation on metallic rhodium."
[5] "These deep differences for the redox properties induced both by the high surface area of ceria and the presence of a transition metal are related to the behavior of ceria for depollution catalysis."
