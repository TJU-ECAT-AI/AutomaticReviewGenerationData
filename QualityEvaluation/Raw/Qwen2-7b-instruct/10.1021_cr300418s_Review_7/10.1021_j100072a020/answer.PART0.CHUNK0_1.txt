[1] "Combined use of XAS with TGA and N20 adsorption allows us to describe the kinetic behavior of ceria or ceria-based systems modified by a transition metal on a large time scale."
[2] "The redox behavior of Rh/CeO2 is quite different from that of pure ceria. In the presence of a transition metal, the reduction rate is highly increased, whereas the oxidation rate needs an induction time before starting."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (VO) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. When an oxygen molecule (O2) contacts the surface, it is split into two oxygen atoms. One oxygen atom immediately reacts with a surface metal atom to form an oxygen vacancy (VO). The other oxygen atom then reacts with a metal ion nearby, leading to the oxidation of the metal ion. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the oxygen vacancy can be formed more easily, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface.

In the context of ceria-based catalysts, the presence of a transition metal like rhodium modifies the redox behavior significantly. The reduction rate of ceria in the presence of rhodium is markedly increased, whereas the oxidation rate requires an induction period before it starts. This difference in the redox behavior suggests that the transition metal affects the oxygen vacancy formation and diffusion processes, influencing the catalytic efficiency and selectivity of the ceria-based catalysts.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位（VO）的形成来工作。当氧气分子（O2）接触表面时，它会被分裂成两个氧原子。一个氧原子立即与表面的金属原子反应形成一个氧空位（VO）。另一个氧原子然后与附近的金属离子反应，导致金属离子的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位可以更容易地形成，这增强了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

在铈基催化剂的背景下，过渡金属如铑的存在显著改变了还原行为。铈在存在铑的情况下，还原速率明显增加，而氧化速率需要诱导期才能开始。这种红氧化行为的差异表明过渡金属影响了氧空位的形成和扩散过程，从而影响铈基催化剂的催化效率和选择性。
