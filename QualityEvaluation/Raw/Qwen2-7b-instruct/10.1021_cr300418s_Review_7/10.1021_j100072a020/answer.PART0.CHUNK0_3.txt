[1] "Combined use of XAS with TGA and N20 adsorption allows us to describe the kinetic behavior of ceria or ceria-based systems modified by a transition metal on a large time scale."
[2] "The reduction content of pure ceria is highly dependent on the surface area. The reduction occurs preliminarily through a surface process."
[3] "In the presence of a transition metal, the reduction rate is highly increased, whereas the oxidation rate needs an induction time before starting."
[4] "A kinetic model of ceria reduction is developed that takes into account the two effects of the surface area and the presence of a transition metal. Ceria reduction occurs first through a surface limitative step, probably hydrogen dissociation, followed by a much slower bulk diffusion step. The rate of the surface step is highly increased on Rh/Ce02 samples through fast hydrogen dissociation on rhodium."

1. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), combined with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and nitrogen dioxide adsorption, enables the characterization of the kinetic behavior of ceria and ceria-based materials modified with a transition metal over a broad timescale.
2. The amount of reduction in pure ceria is significantly influenced by its surface area. Reduction primarily occurs via a surface process.
3. In the presence of a transition metal, the reduction rate is significantly enhanced, while the oxidation rate requires an initial delay before commencing.
4. A kinetic model for ceria reduction has been formulated, which considers the impacts of surface area and transition metal presence. Reduction initiates through a surface-limiting step, likely hydrogen dissociation, followed by a considerably slower bulk diffusion process. The surface step's rate is notably accelerated on Rh/Ce02 samples due to rapid hydrogen dissociation on the rhodium component.

1. X射线吸收光谱（XAS）与热重分析（TGA）和氮氧化物吸附相结合，使得能够描述铈或铈基材料在过渡金属存在的条件下长时间尺度上的动力学行为。
2. 纯铈的还原含量高度依赖于其表面积。还原主要通过表面过程发生。
3. 在过渡金属存在下，还原速率显著增加，而氧化速率需要一个初始延迟才开始。
4. 已开发出一种铈还原的动力学模型，考虑了表面积和过渡金属存在的影响。还原首先通过表面限速步骤发生，可能涉及氢解离，随后是明显较慢的体扩散步骤。在Rh/Ce02样品上，表面步骤的速率由于铑上的快速氢解离而显著加速。
