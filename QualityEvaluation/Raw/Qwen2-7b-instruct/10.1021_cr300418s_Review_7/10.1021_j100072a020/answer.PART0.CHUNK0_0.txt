[1] "Combined use of XAS with TGA and N20 adsorption allows us to describe the kinetic behavior of ceria or ceria-based systems modified by a transition metal on a large time scale. The XAS probe is however of limited use for very fast processes such as those with a first-order rate constant larger than 0.1 s-I."
[2] "The redox behavior of Rh/CeO2 is quite different from that of pure ceria. In the presence of a transition metal, the reduction rate is highly increased, whereas the oxidation rate needs an induction time before starting."
[3] "A kinetic model of ceria reduction is developed that takes into account the two effects of the surface area and the presence of a transition metal. Ceria reduction occurs first through a surface limitative step, probably hydrogen dissociation, followed by a much slower bulk diffusion step. The rate of the surface step is highly increased on Rh/Ce02 samples through fast hydrogen dissociation on rhodium."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically signifies a more energetically demanding process for oxygen vacancy creation, which can affect the overall catalytic efficiency and the ease with which the oxide can perform oxidation reactions.

2. The redox behavior of Rh/CeO2 catalysts shows significant differences compared to pure ceria. When a transition metal like rhodium is present, the reduction rate of the ceria component increases dramatically. However, the oxidation process requires an induction period before it can begin, indicating a disparity in the rates of these two reactions.

3. A kinetic model for ceria reduction has been formulated, taking into account the impacts of surface area and the presence of a transition metal. This model suggests that ceria reduction primarily proceeds through a surface-limitative step, likely involving hydrogen dissociation. This step is significantly accelerated on Rh/CeO2 samples due to the rapid hydrogen dissociation facilitated by the rhodium component. Following this surface step, a much slower bulk diffusion process occurs.

1. 火山克里威尔恩机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧化物表面的氧空位形成。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着关键作用。较高的ΔEv通常意味着创建氧空位的过程更加耗能，这可能会影响整体催化效率以及氧化物执行氧化反应的能力。

2. Rh/CeO2催化剂的氧化还原行为与纯铈表现出显著差异。当存在过渡金属如铑时，铈成分的还原速率大幅度增加。然而，氧化过程需要一个诱导期才能开始，表明这两个反应的速率存在差异。

3. 已经建立了一种关于铈的减缓模型，考虑到了表面面积和过渡金属存在的两个影响因素。该模型表明，铈的减缓首先通过一个表面限速步骤进行，可能涉及氢解离。这个步骤在Rh/CeO2样品上由于铑成分促进快速氢解离而显著加速。紧随其后的是一个更慢的扩散步骤。
