[1] "Combined use of XAS with TGA and N20 adsorption allows us to describe the kinetic behavior of ceria or ceria-based systems modified by a transition metal on a large time scale."
[2] "The reduction content of pure ceria is highly dependent on the surface area. The reduction occurs preliminarily through a surface process."
[3] "In the presence of a transition metal, the reduction rate is highly increased, whereas the oxidation rate needs an induction time before starting."
[4] "A kinetic model of ceria reduction is developed that takes into account the two effects of the surface area and the presence of a transition metal. Ceria reduction occurs first through a surface limitative step, probably hydrogen dissociation, followed by a much slower bulk diffusion step. The rate of the surface step is highly increased on Rh/Ce02 samples through fast hydrogen dissociation on rhodium."

1. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), combined with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and nitrogen dioxide (N20) adsorption, enables the description of the kinetic behavior of ceria or ceria-based materials modified with a transition metal across a wide time scale.
2. The degree of reduction in pure ceria is significantly influenced by its surface area, with the process primarily occurring at the surface level.
3. In the case of ceria containing a transition metal, the reduction rate is notably enhanced, while the oxidation rate requires an initial delay before commencing.
4. A kinetic model for ceria reduction has been established, factoring in the impact of surface area and the presence of a transition metal. The reduction process initiates through a surface-limiting step, likely involving hydrogen dissociation, followed by a substantially slower bulk diffusion process. The rate of the surface step is considerably elevated on Rh/CeO2 samples due to rapid hydrogen dissociation on the rhodium surface.

1.X射线吸收光谱（XAS）与热重分析（TGA）和氮氧化物（N20）吸附结合，允许描述铈或铈基材料通过过渡金属修饰后的大型时间尺度上的动力学行为。
2.纯铈的还原度高度依赖其表面积，还原过程主要发生在表面。
3.在含有过渡金属的铈中，还原速率显著增加，而氧化速率需要初始延迟才开始。
4.建立了一个铈还原的动力学模型，考虑了表面积和过渡金属的存在。还原过程首先通过表面限制步骤启动，可能涉及氢解离，随后是速度明显较慢的宏观扩散步骤。在含有铑的铈O2样品中，由于铑表面快速氢解离，表面步骤的速率显著提高。
