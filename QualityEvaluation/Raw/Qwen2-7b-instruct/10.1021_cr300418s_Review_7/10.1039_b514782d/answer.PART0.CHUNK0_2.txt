[1] "The origin of this difference arises from the vacancy formation energies which show that formation of an oxygen vacancy is least favoured on the (111) surface."
[2] "The magnitude of the energy gained in each reaction can be related to the interactions between the molecules and the oxide surfaces."
[3] "In addition, we have demonstrated that the sensitivity of the energetics of the catalytic reactions to the nature of the surfaces is determined by the surface vacancy formation energy."
[4] "The surface sensitivity so found is consistent with experimental data for CO oxidation over ceria nanoparticles and nanorods."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies act as active sites for the oxidation of molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity of the surface, facilitating more efficient oxidation reactions.

2. The magnitude of the energy gained in each reaction correlates with the interactions between the molecules and the oxide surfaces. This relationship explains how the strength of these interactions influences the efficiency of the catalytic conversion processes.

3. The sensitivity of the energetics of the catalytic reactions to the nature of the surfaces is determined by the surface vacancy formation energy. This finding aligns with experimental observations of CO oxidation over ceria nanoparticles and nanorods, providing insights into the role of ceria in promoting catalytic reactions.

4. The surface sensitivity identified in the study is consistent with experimental data for CO oxidation over ceria nanoparticles and nanorods, supporting the theoretical predictions made using first principles calculations.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过氧化物表面的氧空位进行操作。氧空位作为分子氧化的活性位点发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。较低的ΔEv表明表面反应性更高，促进了更高效的氧化反应。

2. 每个反应中获得的能量大小与分子和氧化物表面之间的相互作用有关。这种关系解释了这些相互作用强度如何影响催化转化过程的效率。

3. 催化反应的能态敏感性由表面氧空位形成能决定。这一发现与用于研究Ceria纳米粒子和纳米棒上CO氧化的实验数据一致，提供了关于Ceria在促进催化反应中的作用的理论预测。

4. 研究中确定的表面敏感性与Ceria纳米粒子和纳米棒上CO氧化的实验数据相一致，支持使用第一原理计算做出的理论预测。
