[1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis."
[2] "In ref. 36 the low index (111), (110) and (100) surfaces have been studied using first principles density functional theory with the generalised gradient approximation (GGA-DFT)."
[3] "However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support."
[4] "Formation of an oxygen vacancy is least favourable on the (111) surface, while this process is most favoured on the (110) surface."
[5] "The origin of this difference arises from the vacancy formation energies which show that formation of an oxygen vacancy is least favoured on the (111) surface."
[6] "The surface sensitivity so found is consistent with experimental data for CO oxidation over ceria nanoparticles and nanorods."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactants, typically involving the formation of oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv means easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the surface's ability to promote oxidation reactions.

2. The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower ΔEv are more likely to form oxygen vacancies, thus enhancing the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions. This is consistent with experimental data on CO oxidation over ceria nanoparticles and nanorods.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过促进氧化物表面向反应物转移氧原子来起作用。氧空位的形成能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这可以增强表面促进氧化反应的能力。

2. ΔEv的重要性在于它对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力的影响。具有较低ΔEv的表面更有可能形成氧空位，从而增强表面促进氧化反应的能力。这与用于碳氧化化铈纳米粒子和纳米棒的实验数据一致。
