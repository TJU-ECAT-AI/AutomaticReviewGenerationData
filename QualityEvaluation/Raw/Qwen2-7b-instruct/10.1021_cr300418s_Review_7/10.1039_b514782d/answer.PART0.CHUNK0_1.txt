[1] "Ceria, CeO2, is used as a support material in automotive catalysis.1 However, due to the relative ease with which ceria surfaces can be reduced (formation of oxygen vacancies) it is not merely an inactive support."
[2] "In order to understand further the role of ceria in catalytic reactions, we have studied for the first time the sensitivity of the energetics of CO oxidation and NO2 and NO reduction over ceria to the nature of the surface."
[3] "Vacancy formation energies will also be influenced by the value of U; however, testing of U values from 17 eV,5 shows that too small a value of U leads to the wrong description of the atomic and electronic structure of reduced ceria and the vacancy formation and reaction energies so computed will be influenced by this error."
[4] "The origin of this difference arises from the vacancy formation energies which show that formation of an oxygen vacancy is least favoured on the (111) surface."
[5] "Thus, it is the oxygen vacancy formation energy (which we have shown is not related to the stability of the pure surface6) which determines the surface sensitivity of these catalytic reactions."
[6] "The present results show that the most favourable surface for vacancy formation cannot simply be predicted from the stabi- lity of the pure surfaces."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv indicates greater difficulty in forming oxygen vacancies, thus potentially leading to lower catalytic activity but higher oxidizing ability due to the stabilization of the oxide surface. The significance lies in the fact that the surface sensitivity to these reactions is directly linked to the energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic processes.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the ceria surface. Surfaces with higher ΔEv tend to have lower catalytic activity because the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for certain reactions, becomes more challenging. Conversely, higher ΔEv can lead to enhanced oxidizing ability as the surface remains more stable and better capable of facilitating the desired chemical transformations. The study reveals that the surface sensitivity to these catalytic reactions is not solely determined by the stability of the pure surface but rather by the energy associated with oxygen vacancy formation.

3. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is a key factor in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the ceria surface in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Surfaces with lower ΔEv are more likely to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is essential for catalytic processes. This results in increased catalytic activity. However, surfaces with higher ΔEv may hinder oxygen vacancy formation, potentially reducing catalytic activity but enhancing oxidizing ability through the stabilization of the surface. The study demonstrates that the sensitivity of the reactions to the surface properties is fundamentally tied to ΔEv, offering insights into optimizing ceria-based catalysts.

4. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) serves as a pivotal determinant in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces involved in oxidation reactions, including those catalyzed by ceria. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can boost catalytic activity but may limit oxidizing ability due to the surface's increased reactivity. Conversely, higher ΔEv suggests greater difficulty in oxygen vacancy formation, potentially enhancing oxidizing ability but possibly reducing catalytic activity. The research underscores the importance of ΔEv in elucidating the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions, contributing to the development of more efficient catalysts.

5. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is central to understanding the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions, such as those catalyzed by ceria. Surfaces with lower ΔEv facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, which can increase catalytic activity but may compromise oxidizing ability. Conversely, higher ΔEv values make oxygen vacancy formation more challenging, potentially boosting oxidizing ability but possibly diminishing catalytic activity. The study highlights ΔEv's role in determining surface sensitivity to catalytic reactions, providing valuable insights for the optimization of oxide catalysts.

6. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical factor in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces, particularly in the context of ceria-based catalysts. Surfaces with lower ΔEv exhibit enhanced catalytic activity due to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which is beneficial for catalytic processes. However, this ease can also limit oxidizing ability by increasing the surface's reactivity. On the other hand, surfaces with higher ΔEv may hinder oxygen vacancy formation, potentially improving oxidizing ability through the stabilization of the surface but possibly reducing catalytic activity. The research emphasizes the importance of ΔEv in understanding the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions, offering guidance for the development of more effective ceria-based catalysts.
