1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactants, typically involving the formation of oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv means easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the surface's ability to promote oxidation reactions.

2. The significance of ΔEv lies in its impact on the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Surfaces with lower ΔEv are more likely to form oxygen vacancies, thus enhancing the surface's ability to facilitate oxidation reactions. This is consistent with experimental data on CO oxidation over ceria nanoparticles and nanorods.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv indicates greater difficulty in forming oxygen vacancies, thus potentially leading to lower catalytic activity but higher oxidizing ability due to the stabilization of the oxide surface. The significance lies in the fact that the surface sensitivity to these reactions is directly linked to the energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation, affecting the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic processes.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the ceria surface. Surfaces with higher ΔEv tend to have lower catalytic activity because the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is crucial for certain reactions, becomes more challenging. Conversely, higher ΔEv can lead to enhanced oxidizing ability as the surface remains more stable and better capable of facilitating the desired chemical transformations. The study reveals that the surface sensitivity to these catalytic reactions is not solely determined by the stability of the pure surface but rather by the energy associated with oxygen vacancy formation.

3. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is a key factor in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the ceria surface in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. Surfaces with lower ΔEv are more likely to facilitate the formation of oxygen vacancies, which is essential for catalytic processes. This results in increased catalytic activity. However, surfaces with higher ΔEv may hinder oxygen vacancy formation, potentially reducing catalytic activity but enhancing oxidizing ability through the stabilization of the surface. The study demonstrates that the sensitivity of the reactions to the surface properties is fundamentally tied to ΔEv, offering insights into optimizing ceria-based catalysts.

4. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) serves as a pivotal determinant in the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces involved in oxidation reactions, including those catalyzed by ceria. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can boost catalytic activity but may limit oxidizing ability due to the surface's increased reactivity. Conversely, higher ΔEv suggests greater difficulty in oxygen vacancy formation, potentially enhancing oxidizing ability but possibly reducing catalytic activity. The research underscores the importance of ΔEv in elucidating the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions, contributing to the development of more efficient catalysts.

5. The oxygen vacancy formation energy (ΔEv) is central to understanding the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of oxide surfaces in oxidation reactions, such as those catalyzed by ceria. Surfaces with lower ΔEv facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, which can increase catalytic activity but may compromise oxidizing ability. Conversely, higher ΔEv values make oxygen vacancy formation more challenging, potentially boosting oxidizing ability but possibly diminishing catalytic activity. The study highlights ΔEv's role in determining surface sensitivity to catalytic reactions, providing valuable insights for the optimization of oxide catalysts.

6. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is a critical factor in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of oxide surfaces, particularly in the context of ceria-based catalysts. Surfaces with lower ΔEv exhibit enhanced catalytic activity due to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which is beneficial for catalytic processes. However, this ease can also limit oxidizing ability by increasing the surface's reactivity. On the other hand, surfaces with higher ΔEv may hinder oxygen vacancy formation, potentially improving oxidizing ability through the stabilization of the surface but possibly reducing catalytic activity. The research emphasizes the importance of ΔEv in understanding the surface sensitivity of catalytic reactions, offering guidance for the development of more effective ceria-based catalysts.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies act as sites where reactant molecules can adsorb, undergo oxidation, and then release products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv means easier formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power.
2. The energy for the reaction CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO (and CO + NO → CO2 + 1/2 N2) is independent of the ceria surface, as ceria acts as a catalyst rather than participating in the reaction. However, the surface dependence of the individual reactions, such as the magnitudes of the energies and the surface dependency, is determined by factors including the surface vacancy formation energy. The (110) surface seems to be suitable for studying these catalytic reactions based on the analysis of the vacancy formation energies.

2. 形成CO2的反应能量对铈氧化物表面独立，因为铈氧化物仅作为催化剂而非参与反应。然而，单个反应（如CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO和CO + NO → CO2 + 1/2 N2）的表面依赖性，包括能量的大小和表面依赖性，是由包括氧空位形成能在内的因素决定的。基于对氧空位形成能的分析，(110)表面似乎适合研究这些催化反应。

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an intermediate with a high energy barrier, requiring additional energy for the reaction to proceed. This energy barrier is represented by the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). In determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, ΔEv plays a crucial role. A lower ΔEv signifies a higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as the surface is more likely to facilitate the reaction by forming an oxygen vacancy.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because a lower ΔEv indicates a more favorable condition for the formation of an oxygen vacancy, which is essential for catalytic reactions. The (111) surface shows the least favorable conditions for oxygen vacancy formation among the surfaces examined, implying that reactions occurring on this surface might exhibit lower catalytic activity and oxidizing ability compared to surfaces with higher ΔEv.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成具有高能量壁垒的中间体进行操作，需要额外的能量才能使反应继续进行。这个能量壁垒由氧空位形成能（ΔEv）表示。确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时，ΔEv起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为表面更有可能通过形成氧空位促进反应。

2. 氧空位形成能（ΔEv）显著影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为较低的ΔEv表明氧空位形成的条件更为有利，这对于催化反应至关重要。在研究的表面中，（111）表面显示出最不利的氧空位形成条件，这意味着在该表面上进行的反应可能表现出较低的催化活性和氧化能力，与ΔEv较高的表面相比。
