[4] "Vacancy formation energies will also be influenced by the value of U; however, testing of U values from 17 eV,5 shows that too small a value of U leads to the wrong description of the atomic and electronic structure of reduced ceria and the vacancy formation and reaction energies so computed will be influenced by this error."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an intermediate with a high energy barrier, requiring additional energy for the reaction to proceed. This energy barrier is represented by the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). In determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, ΔEv plays a crucial role. A lower ΔEv signifies a higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, as the surface is more likely to facilitate the reaction by forming an oxygen vacancy.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because a lower ΔEv indicates a more favorable condition for the formation of an oxygen vacancy, which is essential for catalytic reactions. The (111) surface shows the least favorable conditions for oxygen vacancy formation among the surfaces examined, implying that reactions occurring on this surface might exhibit lower catalytic activity and oxidizing ability compared to surfaces with higher ΔEv.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成具有高能量壁垒的中间体进行操作，需要额外的能量才能使反应继续进行。这个能量壁垒由氧空位形成能（ΔEv）表示。确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时，ΔEv起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv意味着更高的催化活性和氧化能力，因为表面更有可能通过形成氧空位促进反应。

2. 氧空位形成能（ΔEv）显著影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为较低的ΔEv表明氧空位形成的条件更为有利，这对于催化反应至关重要。在研究的表面中，（111）表面显示出最不利的氧空位形成条件，这意味着在该表面上进行的反应可能表现出较低的催化活性和氧化能力，与ΔEv较高的表面相比。
