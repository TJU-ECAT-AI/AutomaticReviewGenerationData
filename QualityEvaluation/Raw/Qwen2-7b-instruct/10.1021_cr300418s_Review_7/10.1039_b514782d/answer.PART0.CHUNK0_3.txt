[1] "The sensitivity of the energetics of the catalytic reactions to the nature of the surfaces is determined by the surface vacancy formation energy."
[2] "For example, the energy for formation of CO2 is most favourable on the (110) surface and least favourable on the (111) surface."
[3] "The surface sensitivity so found is consistent with experimental data for CO oxidation over ceria nanoparticles and nanorods."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies act as sites where reactant molecules can adsorb, undergo oxidation, and then release products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv means easier formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power.
2. The energy for the reaction CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO (and CO + NO → CO2 + 1/2 N2) is independent of the ceria surface, as ceria acts as a catalyst rather than participating in the reaction. However, the surface dependence of the individual reactions, such as the magnitudes of the energies and the surface dependency, is determined by factors including the surface vacancy formation energy. The (110) surface seems to be suitable for studying these catalytic reactions based on the analysis of the vacancy formation energies.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧化物表面的氧空位的形成和利用进行操作。氧空位作为反应物分子可以吸附、氧化并释放产物的位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于催化剂活性和氧化能力具有重要影响。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，可能带来更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。
2. 形成CO2的反应能量对铈氧化物表面独立，因为铈氧化物仅作为催化剂而非参与反应。然而，单个反应（如CO + NO2 → CO2 + NO和CO + NO → CO2 + 1/2 N2）的表面依赖性，包括能量的大小和表面依赖性，是由包括氧空位形成能在内的因素决定的。基于对氧空位形成能的分析，(110)表面似乎适合研究这些催化反应。
