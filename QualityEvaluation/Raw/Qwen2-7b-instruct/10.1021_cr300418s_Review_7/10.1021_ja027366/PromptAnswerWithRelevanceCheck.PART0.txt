The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism describes how adsorbed molecules react on metal surfaces during oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. It involves the adsorption, oxidation of the molecule, and release of the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values generally enhance catalytic activity because they increase the surface's reactivity. Moreover, lower ΔEv can also boost the oxidizing ability by promoting the creation of reactive oxygen species.

Answer: The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can enhance the surface reactivity and thus increase the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the catalyst.
