The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism describes how adsorbed molecules react on metal surfaces during oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. It involves the adsorption, oxidation of the molecule, and release of the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values generally enhance catalytic activity because they increase the surface's reactivity. Moreover, lower ΔEv can also boost the oxidizing ability by promoting the creation of reactive oxygen species.

火星-范克雷文机制描述了金属表面在氧化物催化氧化反应中的吸附分子反应过程。它包括分子的吸附、氧化以及氧化产物的释放。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要作用。较低的ΔEv值通常能提高催化活性，因为它们增强了表面的活性。此外，较低的ΔEv也能增强氧化能力，通过促进活性氧物种的产生。
