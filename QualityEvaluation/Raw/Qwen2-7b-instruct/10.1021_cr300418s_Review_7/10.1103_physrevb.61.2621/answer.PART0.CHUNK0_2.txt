The document discusses the study of the aluminum substitutional defect in quartz using first-principles pseudopotential calculations. It details the determination of microscopic properties such as Al coordination, the symmetry of the distorted lattice, and defect-induced electronic states. The spin density is found to be evenly distributed on the four oxygen nearest neighbors to Al, contrary to phenomenological models. The document also mentions the use of DFT and a supercell approach to study the lattice distortion, density of states, and electronic spin density localization. The results indicate that the Al atom is tetrahedrically coordinated, and the elongation of Al-O bonds compared to Si-O bonds is attributed to ionic character effects. The total number of bonding states remains consistent between the perfect crystal and the Al-h center. A hole is found in an antibonding impurity state near the band edge, contributing to the color properties of the Al-h center. The calculated spin density is evenly distributed among the four oxygen atoms, with specific orbital orientations influenced by the C2 symmetry of the system.

文档讨论了对石英中铝取代缺陷的原理性电势点势函数计算研究。它详细描述了确定微观性质，如铝的配位、畸变晶格的对称性和缺陷诱导的电子状态。计算结果显示，自旋密度均匀分布在铝周围四个最近的氧原子上，与经验模型结果相反。文档还提到使用第一性原理和超单元方法来研究晶格畸变、密度态和电子自旋密度局部化。结果表明，铝原子呈四面体配位，铝-O键的伸长归因于离子特性效应。完美的晶体和Al-h中心之间的成键状态总数保持一致。在带边附近发现了一个空穴，在杂质状态中，这为Al-h中心的颜色属性做出了贡献。计算得到的自旋密度均匀分布在四个氧原子上，特定的轨道定向受系统C2对称性的影响。
