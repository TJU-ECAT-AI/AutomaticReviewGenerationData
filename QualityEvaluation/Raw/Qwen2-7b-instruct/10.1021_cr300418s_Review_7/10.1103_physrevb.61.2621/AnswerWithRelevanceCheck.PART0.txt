          [I] "Our results show that the spin density is evenly distributed on the four oxygen nearest neighbors to Al in contrast to phenomenological model results."
          [II] "The Al atom substitutes the Si atom with little lattice distortion and maintaining the local C2 symmetry of the Si site."
          [III] "The hole is found to produce a spin density equally localized on the four nearest-neighbors oxygens of the impurity atom."
          [IV] "The elongation of the Al-O bonds with respect to the Si-O bonds mentioned in Sec. III A is due to electrostatic effects related to the ionic character of the bonds: the Al3+ core is less bound to oxygens than the Si4+ core."

          The spin density of the Al-h center is evenly distributed on the four nearest oxygen neighbors to the Al atom, differing from the phenomenological model predictions. The Al atom replaces the Si atom with minimal lattice distortion while preserving the local C2 symmetry of the Si site. The hole generates a spin density that is equally localized on the four closest oxygen neighbors of the impurity atom. The extension of the Al-O bonds relative to the Si-O bonds, as discussed in Section III A, is attributed to electrostatic effects stemming from the ionic nature of the bonds: the Al3+ nucleus binds less strongly to oxygen atoms compared to the Si4+ nucleus.

          Al-h中心的自旋密度均匀分布在四个最近邻的氧原子上，与经验模型预测的结果不同。Al原子替代了Si原子，同时保持了Si位点的局部C2对称性，且几乎没有晶格畸变。空穴在杂质原子的四个最近邻氧原子上产生了等同局部化的自旋密度。根据第三部分A节所述，Al-O键相对于Si-O键的延伸是由于静电效应：Al3+核与氧原子的结合强度小于Si4+核。

          Al-h中心的自旋密度均匀分布在铝周围最近的四个氧原子上，与经验模型预测的结果不同。Al原子替代了Si原子，同时保持了Si位点的局部C2对称性，且几乎没有晶格畸变。空穴在杂质原子的四个最近邻氧原子上产生了等同局部化的自旋密度。根据第三部分A节所述，Al-O键相对于Si-O键的延伸是由于静电效应：Al3+核与氧原子的结合强度小于Si4+核。
