[1] "The purpose of the present work is to extend the study of the substitutional impurities through a calculation of the hyperfine matrices for the magnetic nuclei 27Al,29Si,31P, and 17O."
[2] "It is found that the unpaired spin state of substi- tutional P is well described by the theory, while the unpaired spin state found for substitutional Al is severely at variance with the experimental data."
[3] "While the Hartree-Fock approximation favors a structural distortion with one Al-O bond becoming ;14% longer than the other three, the B3LYP energy functional does not lead to such a distortion but rather to a restoration of the C2 symmetry of the cluster."
[4] "To clarify the reason for these inaccuracies a new inves- tigation of the substitutional Al impurity within the cluster approximation was performed."

1. The study aims to calculate the hyperfine matrices for magnetic nuclei 27Al, 29Si, 31P, and 17O to extend the understanding of substitutional impurities.

2. The unpaired spin state of substitutional phosphorus (P) is accurately described by the theory, contrasting sharply with the substitutional aluminum (Al) state which significantly deviates from experimental data.

3. In the Hartree-Fock approximation, a structural distortion is favored with one Al-O bond elongating by 14%, while the B3LYP energy functional avoids this distortion and restores cluster symmetry.

4. Inaccuracies in describing the Al impurity state led to a new investigation focusing on the substitutional Al impurity within the cluster approximation.

1. 现在的工作目的是通过计算磁核的超精细矩阵来扩展对置换杂质的研究，涉及27Al、29Si、31P和17O等核。

2. 对于置换磷(P)，其不成对自旋状态能够被理论准确描述，而置换铝(Al)的不成对自旋状态与实验数据存在严重不符。

3. 在哈特里-福克近似中，一个有利的结构畸变被发现，其中一个Al-O键比其他三个长14%，而B3LYP能量函数则避免了这种畸变并恢复了簇的对称性。

4. 为了澄清这些不准确性的原因，进行了新的研究，集中于置换铝杂质在簇近似中的情况。
