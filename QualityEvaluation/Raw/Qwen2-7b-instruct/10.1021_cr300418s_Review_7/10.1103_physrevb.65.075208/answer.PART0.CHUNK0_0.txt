[1] "The purpose of the present work is to extend the study of the substitutional impurities through a calculation of the hyperfine matrices for the magnetic nuclei 27Al,29Si,31P, and 17O."
[2] "While the supercell DFT calculations for the substitutional Al impurity as expected yields hyperfine parameters in strong disagreement with experiment, the method accounts well for the hyperfine parameters of substitutional P."
[3] "In the case of substitutional P, on the other hand, the impurity 3sp levels lie below those of Si, so the bonding P-O states appears at the lower edge of the Si-O ones, while the antibonding states falls below the conduction band and forms a gap state."
[4] "In the Hartree-Fock equilibrium geometry both energy functionals have been applied, and it can be seen that the Hartree-Fock approximation still provides the best description of the anisotropic couplings, although the B3LYP results are not too far from the experimental values in this case."
[5] "The results presented above show that the PW91 approximation adequately describes the electronic structure of a neutral substitutional P impurity in a-quartz but fails dramatically for the corresponding Al impurity."

1. The purpose of this research is to expand the study of substitutional impurities by calculating the hyperfine matrices for magnetic nuclei 27Al, 29Si, 31P, and 17O. 

2. Supercell DFT calculations for substitutional Al impurities result in hyperfine parameters that significantly disagree with experimental data, unlike substitutional P impurities.

3. In substitutional P impurities, the 3sp levels are positioned below those of Si, causing bonding P-O states to appear at the lower edge of the Si-O states, while antibonding states fall below the conduction band forming a gap state.

4. In the Hartree-Fock equilibrium geometry, both energy functionals provide the best description of anisotropic couplings, with B3LYP results not far from experimental values.

5. The PW91 approximation accurately describes the electronic structure of neutral substitutional P impurities in a-quartz, whereas it fails for substitutional Al impurities.

1. 现在工作的目的是通过计算磁核27Al、29Si、31P和17O的自旋-核相互作用矩阵来扩展对置换杂质的研究。

2. 对于置换Al杂质的超晶格DFT计算，预期会得到与实验数据严重不符的自旋-核相互作用参数，而置换P杂质则不同。

3. 在置换P杂质中，3sp能级位于Si能级之下，导致P-O共价键态出现在Si-O态的下边缘，而反键态则位于导带之下形成一个能隙状态。

4. 在哈特里-福克平衡几何结构中，两种能量函数都能提供最佳的各向异性耦合描述，B3LYP结果与实验值相差不大。

5. PW91近似准确地描述了无电荷置换P杂质在a-石英中的电子结构，而对于置换Al杂质，它却失败了。
