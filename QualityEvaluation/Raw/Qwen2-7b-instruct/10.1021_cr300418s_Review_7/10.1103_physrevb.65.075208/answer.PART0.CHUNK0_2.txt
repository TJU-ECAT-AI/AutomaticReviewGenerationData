[1] "Several theoretical studies of substitutional Al impurities have been reported earlier,12,13,2729 but the results from Hartree-Fock cluster calculations12,13 have not been consistent with those of DFT-based supercell approaches.2729"
[2] "It is argued that this is partly due to the different nature of the silica valence and conduction bands and partly to the DFT self-interaction error being larger for holes than for electrons."
[3] "While the Hartree-Fock approximation favors a structural distortion with one Al-O bond becoming ;14% longer than the other three, the B3LYP energy functional does not lead to such a distortion but rather to a restoration of the C2 symmetry of the cluster, which was explicitly broken in the initial configuration."
[4] "In the case of substitutional P, on the other hand, the impurity 3sp levels lie below those of Si, so the bonding P-O states appears at the lower edge of the Si-O ones, while the antibonding states falls below the conduction band and forms a gap state."
[5] "The electronic structure found is summarized in Fig. 1."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to facilitate the oxidation process. The ΔEv is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. High ΔEv values can lead to increased catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing power, as they provide sufficient energy for the reaction to proceed efficiently.
