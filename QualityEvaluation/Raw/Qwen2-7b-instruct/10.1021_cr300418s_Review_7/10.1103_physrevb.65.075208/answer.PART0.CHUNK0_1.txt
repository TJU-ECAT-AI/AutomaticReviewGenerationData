1. The unpaired spin state of substitutional phosphorus (P) in silica is accurately described by density functional theory (DFT). In contrast, the unpaired spin state of substitutional aluminum (Al) deviates significantly from experimental data.

2. There have been numerous experimental studies to understand the properties of aluminum and phosphorus impurities in both crystalline and amorphous silica, but the methods typically provide indirect information about the impurities' geometry and electronic structure.

3. Earlier theoretical studies on aluminum impurities have produced inconsistent results compared to density functional theory (DFT)-based supercell approaches.

4. The electronic structure of substitutional aluminum and phosphorus impurities in silica is studied using supercell calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT).

5. DFT self-interactions are found to be larger for holes than for electrons.

6. A structural distortion with one Al-O bond elongating by 14% compared to the others is favored by the Hartree-Fock approximation, whereas the B3LYP energy functional restores the C2 symmetry of the cluster.

7. In the case of substitutional phosphorus, its 3sp levels are below those of silicon, leading to bonding P-O states at the lower edge of the Si-O states and antibonding states below the conduction band forming a gap state.

8. The presence of a non-zero valence electron spin density modifies the core wave functions, adding an additional contribution to the spin density at the nucleus.

9. The accuracy of the pseudopotential approach to calculate hyperfine parameters was tested using phosphorus pseudopotentials with varying numbers of augmentation orbitals.

10. Core polarization effects increase the isotropic coupling constant by 1% for silicon and decrease it by 4% for oxygen.

11. The Hartree-Fock approximation provides good agreement with experimental values for the anisotropic tensor, while the B3LYP results align closely with the supercell PW91 calculation and diverge from experimental data.

12. The large energy difference within the Hartree-Fock approximation suggests that the error might be significantly higher than initially thought.
