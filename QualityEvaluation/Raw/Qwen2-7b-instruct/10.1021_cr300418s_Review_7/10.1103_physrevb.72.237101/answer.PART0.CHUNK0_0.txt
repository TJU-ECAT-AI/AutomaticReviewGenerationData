[1] "Three of the four Ce valence electrons are donated to oxygen, and the remaining one is distributed roughly equally among the seven 4f orbitals resulting in an almost spherical f-charge distribution and a metallic ground state."
[2] "Concomitantly the electrons remain itinerant, and many oxides are predicted to be metals instead of the experimentally observed insulators."
[3] "Using two all-electron AE methods, we show that the pseudopotential result cannot be sustained, i.e., it does not correctly describe the AE LDA limit. Both the projector augmented wave PAW method,3 as implemented in the VASP package,4 and the full-potential linearized augmented wave FLAPW method, implemented in the WIEN2K program,5 predict a metallic ferromagnetic FM ground state in LDA in agreement with earlier calculations,see, e.g., Ref. 1 and only LDA+U yields the correct AF insulating state.2"
[4] "The electronic ground state was determined by using an LDA+U approach6 and lowering the U until the effective U becomes zero. We have used a simple LDA+U version where the local part is described by the Ceperley-Alder functional7 and the one-center Coulomb and exchange interactions are treated by a single effective parameter U=UJ.8"
[5] "In this state, and in the FM-LDA ground state, one electron is distributed among different f orbitals. Furthermore, the FM state is 0.1 eV lower in energy than the AF metallic state."
[6] "The reason for the failure of these pseudopotentials to reproduce the AE results is an outward shift of the maximum of the 4f pseudowave function, causing a reduction of the core-valence overlap, and in turn, a too large value for the spin enhancement factor r = mr core-charger + valence-charger 1 in the region where the magnetization density mr reaches its maximum."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies easier formation and migration of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's reactivity and oxidizing capability. This process involves the creation of surface defects, which facilitate the adsorption of reactants, their conversion into products, and the release of these products from the surface, thereby promoting the overall reaction rate.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧空位的形成和迁移进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更容易形成和迁移，从而增强表面的反应性和氧化能力。这一过程涉及表面缺陷的产生，这有助于反应物的吸附、转换为产物以及产物从表面的释放，从而促进整体反应速率。
