[1] "Concomitantly the electrons remain itinerant, and many oxides are predicted to be metals instead of the experimentally observed insulators."
[2] "Three of the four Ce valence electrons are donated to oxygen, and the remaining one is distributed roughly equally among the seven 4f orbitals resulting in an almost spherical f-charge distribution and a metallic ground state."
[3] "An insulating AF groundstate is observed even for a relatively modest U, and the localized electron occupies a single f orbital which is a hybrid of the two real spherical harmonics fz3 and fyy23x2 in agreement with Ref. 2."
[4] "The reason for the failure of these pseudopotentials to reproduce the AE results is an outward shift of the maximum of the 4f pseudowave function, causing a reduction of the core-valence overlap, and in turn, a too large value for the spin enhancement factor r = mr core-charger + valence-charger 1 in the region where the magnetization density mr reaches its maximum."
[5] "We have used a simple LDA+U version where the local part is described by the Ceperley-Alder functional and the one-center Coulomb and exchange interactions are treated by a single effective parameter U=UJ."
[6] "Since the U operates in the atomic spheres only and the PAW spheres are larger than the FLAPW spheres, the effect of U is somewhat stronger in the PAW method."
[7] "Furthermore, the FM state is 0.1 eV lower in energy than the AF metallic state."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which can reduce the rate of reaction and thus affect the overall catalytic efficiency. Conversely, a lower ΔEv facilitates easier vacancy formation and migration, enhancing the reaction rate and improving the catalyst's performance. The mechanism involves the adsorption of reactants, the formation of an oxygen vacancy, the diffusion of oxygen species across the surface, and their recombination to form the desired product.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位的形成和迁移发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较高的ΔEv意味着更稳定的氧空位，这可以降低反应速率并因此影响总体催化效率。相反，较低的ΔEv有利于更容易地形成和迁移氧物种，从而提高反应速率并改善催化剂性能。机制涉及反应物吸附、氧空位形成、表面氧物种扩散以及它们的再组合形成所需产物的过程。
