[1] "Three of the four Ce valence electrons are donated to oxygen, and the remaining one is distributed roughly equally among the seven 4f orbitals resulting in an almost spherical f-charge distribution and a metallic ground state."
[2] "Concomitantly the electrons remain itinerant, and many oxides are predicted to be metals instead of the experimentally observed insulators."
[3] "We have used a simple LDA+U version where the local part is described by the Ceperley-Alder functional and the one-center Coulomb and exchange interactions are treated by a single effective parameter U=UJ."
[4] "Figure 1 shows the electronic density of states for U=1 and 0 eV for the FLAPW and the PAW method."
[5] "The reason for the failure of these pseudopotentials to reproduce the AE results is an outward shift of the maximum of the 4f pseudowave function, causing a reduction of the core-valence overlap, and in turn, a too large value for the spin enhancement factor r = mr core-charger + valence-charger 1 in the region where the magnetization density mr reaches its maximum."
[6] "In conclusion, all-electron local density functional calculations do not yield the proper insulating ground state for Ce2O3. The previous pseudopotential calculations suffer from an erroneous overestimation of the spin-enhancement factor and a resulting overestimation of the exchange splitting."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen vacancies (O vac) to the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies are crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in this process. According to the document, the previous pseudopotential calculations for Ce2O3 failed to accurately describe the system due to an erroneous overestimation of the spin-enhancement factor and the exchange splitting. This led to an incorrect prediction of the material's ground state as metallic rather than insulating.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化空位（O vac）向氧化物催化剂表面的转移而起作用。氧化空位对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。形成氧化空位所需的能量（ΔEv）在这个过程中起着重要作用。根据文档，对Ce2O3的先前假势电荷计算未能准确描述该系统，原因是对自旋增强因子的错误高估和交换分裂的高估。这导致预测材料的基态为金属而非绝缘体。
