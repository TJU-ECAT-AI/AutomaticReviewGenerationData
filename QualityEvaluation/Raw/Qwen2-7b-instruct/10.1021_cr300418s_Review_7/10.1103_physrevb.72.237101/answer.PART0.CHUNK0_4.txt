[1] "Concomitantly the electrons remain itinerant, and many oxides are predicted to be metals instead of the experimentally observed insulators."
[2] "Three of the four Ce valence electrons are donated to oxygen, and the remaining one is distributed roughly equally among the seven 4f orbitals resulting in an almost spherical f-charge distribution and a metallic ground state."
[3] "Both the projector augmented wave PAW method,3 as implemented in the VASP package,4 and the full-potential linearized augmented wave FLAPW method, implemented in the WIEN2K program,5 predict a metallic ferromagnetic FM ground state in LDA in agreement with earlier calculations,see, e.g., Ref. 1"
[4] "An insulating AF groundstate is observed even for a relatively modest U, and the localized electron occupies a single f orbital which is a hybrid of the two real spherical harmonics fz3 and fyy23x2 in agreement with Ref. 2."
[5] "The reason for the failure of these pseudopotentials to reproduce the AE results is an outward shift of the maximum of the 4f pseudowave function, causing a reduction of the core-valence overlap, and in turn, a too large value for the spin enhancement factor r = mr core-charger + valence-charger 1 in the region where the magnetization density mr reaches its maximum."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the literature, in the case of Ce2O3, three out of the four Ce valence electrons are donated to oxygen, leaving one electron distributed among the seven 4f orbitals, resulting in a metallic ground state. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method and the full-potential linearized augmented wave (FLAPW) method predict a metallic ferromagnetic ground state in the local density approximation (LDA), agreeing with earlier calculations. For a relatively modest U value, an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state is observed, with the localized electron occupying a single f orbital, a hybrid of the two real spherical harmonics fz3 and fyy23x2. The failure of pseudopotential calculations to reproduce the all-electron (AE) results is attributed to an outward shift of the maximum of the 4f pseudowave function, reducing the core-valence overlap and causing an erroneous overestimation of the spin enhancement factor, leading to an overestimated exchange splitting.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧空位（ΔEv）的形成。氧空位的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。根据文献，在铈氧化物（Ce2O3）的情况下，四个价电子中的三个被捐赠给氧，剩下一个电子大致平均分布在七个4f轨道上，导致接近球形的f电荷分布和金属基态。投影加权（PAW）方法和全势线性化加权（FLAPW）方法在局部密度近似（LDA）中预测到铁磁金属基态，这与之前的计算结果一致。对于相对适度的U值，观察到绝缘的自旋反平行基态，局部化的电子占据单个f轨道，这是两个真实球谐函数fz3和fyy23x2的混合体。假潜在力计算未能重现所有电子（AE）结果的原因是4f假波函数的最大值外移，导致核心价重叠减少，从而导致在磁化密度mr达到最大值区域的自旋增强因子r = mr核心-充电器 + 价-充电器 1的错误过估计，导致交换分裂显著过估，从而导致特定4f轨道的错误降低。
