Comment on Taming multiple valency with density functionals: A case study of defective ceria Georg Kresse Institut fr Materialphysik, Universitt Wien, Sensengasse 8/12, A-1090 Wien, Austria Peter Blaha Institut fr Materialchemie, Technische Universitt Wien, Getreidemarkt 9, A-1060 Wien, Austria Juarez L.

Veronica Ganduglia-Pirovano Humboldt-Universitt zu Berlin, Institut fr Chemie, Unter den Linden 6, D-10099 Berlin, Germany Received 6 June 2005; published 23 December 2005 We show that two all-electron methods, the full-potential linearized augmented wave method and the pro- jector augmented wave method, yield a metallic groundstate for Ce2O3, as opposed to the experimentally observed insulating groundstate. This is in contrast to previous pseudopotential calculations Phys. Rev.

PACS numbers: 71.15.Mb, 61.72.Ji, 82.47.Ed Ab initio density functional theory has been very success- ful in the prediction of the magnetic properties of itinerant systems. Its application to materials with strongly localized electrons, for instance, 3d transition metal oxides and the oxides of lanthanides, has been only partly successful, since spurious self interactions in the present density functionals prevent the localization of 3d and 4f electrons. Concomi- tantly the electrons remain itinerant, and many oxides are predicted to be metals instead of the experimentally observed insulators.
In the past, calculations for Ce2O3 have been plagued by this problem: Three of the four Ce valence electrons are do- nated to oxygen, and the remaining one is distributed roughly equally among the seven 4f orbitals resulting in an almost spherical f-charge distribution and a metallic ground state.1 Recently this observation has been challenged by S.
Fabris et al.2 In the local density approximation LDA and the generalized gradient approximation GGA, they deter- mined an antiferromagnetic AF insulating groundstate which is roughly 0.36 and 0.99 eV lower in energy than the AF metallic state, respectively. Using two all-electron AE methods, we show that the pseudopotential result cannot be sustained, i.e., it does not correctly describe the AE LDA limit. Both the projector augmented wave PAW method,3 as implemented in the VASP package,4 and the full-potential lin- earized augmented wave FLAPW method, implemented in the WIEN2K program,5 predict a metallic ferromagnetic FM ground state in LDA in agreement with earlier calculations,see, e.g., Ref. 1 and only LDA+U yields the correct AF insulating state.2 The electronic ground state was determined by using an LDA+U approach6 and lowering the U until the effective U becomes zero. We have used a simple LDA+U version where the local part is described by the Ceperley-Alder functional7 and the one-center Coulomb and exchange inter- actions are treated by a single effective parameter U=UJ.8 Figure 1 shows the electronic density of states for U=1 and 0 eV for the FLAPW and the PAW method. Since the U operates in the atomic spheres only and the PAW spheres are larger than the FLAPW spheres, the effect of U is somewhat stronger in the PAW method. Otherwise both methods yield identical results. An insulating AF groundstate is observed even for a relatively modest U, and the localized electron occupies a single f orbital which is a hybrid of the two real spherical harmonics fz3 and fyy23x2 in agreement with Ref.
2. When U decreases, the gap decreases as well, until an AF
metallic state is reached at roughly U=0.4 eV. In this state,and in the FM-LDA ground state, one electron is distributed among different f orbitals. Furthermore, the FM state is
0.1 eV lower in energy than the AF metallic state.
The previous pseudopotential resultan insulating ground state for U=0could be reproduced using ultrasoft

1098-0121/2005/7223/2371012/$23.00 2005 The American Physical Society 237101-1 pseudopotentials, if the core radius for the reconstruction of the charge density augmentation radius was set to rc
0.7 Å. The reason for the failure of these pseudopotentials
to reproduce the AE results is an outward shift of the maxi- mum of the 4f pseudowave function, causing a reduction of the core-valence overlap, and in turn, a too large value for the spin enhancement factor r = mr core-charger + valence-charger 1 in the region where the magnetization density mr reaches its maximum. As a result, the exchange splitting is signifi- cantly overestimated leading to an incorrect lowering of one specific 4f orbital. The problem has been amply discussed in literature and can lead to artifacts, such as the overestimation of the magnetic moment in bcc Fe pseudopotential GGA calculations in Ref. 9 obtain a moment of 2.44 B, whereas the AE value is 2.2 B, see, e.g., Ref. 4 or the incorrect prediction of a magnetic V001 surface.10 In conclusion, all-electron local density functional calcu- lations do not yield the proper insulating ground state for Ce2O3. The previous pseudopotential calculations suffer from an erroneous overestimation of the spin-enhancement factor and a resulting overestimation of the exchange split- ting. In passing, we note that another recent pseudopotential study seems to suffer from similar pseudopotential deficiencies.11 In general we believe that the application of pseudopotentials to magnetic systems is therefore problem- atic, and values must be checked against AE calculations.

Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.
