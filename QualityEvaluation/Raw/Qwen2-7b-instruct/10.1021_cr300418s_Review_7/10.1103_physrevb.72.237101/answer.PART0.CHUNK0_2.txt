[1] "Concomitantly the electrons remain itinerant, and many oxides are predicted to be metals instead of the experimentally observed insulators."
[2] "Three of the four Ce valence electrons are donated to oxygen, and the remaining one is distributed roughly equally among the seven 4f orbitals resulting in an almost spherical f-charge distribution and a metallic ground state."
[3] "An insulating AF groundstate is observed even for a relatively modest U, and the localized electron occupies a single f orbital which is a hybrid of the two real spherical harmonics fz3 and fyy23x2 in agreement with Ref. 2."
[4] "In passing, we note that another recent pseudopotential study seems to suffer from similar pseudopotential deficiencies."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the reaction's catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面氧向反应分子的转移而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位的形成更为容易，从而增强反应的催化效率和氧化能力。
