[1] "The present results provide additional and independent support to the claim that the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation has its origin in the ease to create oxygen vacancies in the support."
[2] "The oxygen vacancy energy formation (Ef) has been calculated as (1) where E(Ti36O72) is the total energy of the low spin solution for bulk TiO2, using the 3 × 3 × 1 supercell described above, E(O2) is the total energy of a oxygen molecule in the triplet state calculated with the same computational setup used for the oxide, and E(Ti36O71) is the energy of the same supercell with one oxygen removed thus resulting in a TiO1.972 stoichiometry for the reduced system."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because a lower ΔEv facilitates the creation of more oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity by providing more sites for the activation of oxygen and subsequent oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着重要作用。这是因为更低的ΔEv有助于创建更多的氧空位，从而通过提供更多的激活氧和后续氧化反应的场所来增强催化活性。
