[1] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach."
[2] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase but strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface."
[3] "The present results provide additional and independent support to the claim that the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation has its origin in the ease to create oxygen vacancies in the support."
[4] "Creation of an oxygen vacancy defect in bulk FeTiO2 results in an elongation of the (FeTi)V distance from 3.875 to 4.132 Å, a structural change similar to that produced in bulk TiO2."
[5] "The oxygen vacancy formation energies Ef calculated in this work for TiO2 and FeTiO2 and summarized in Table 4 confirm that doping with Fe reduces the energy necessary to create an oxygen vacancy in TiO2 by more than 2 eV. And this is true both for the bulk and for the surface."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the substrate molecule undergoing oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv signifies easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power by providing more active sites for the reaction.

2. The presence of iron (Fe) doping in titanium dioxide (TiO2) significantly reduces the energy necessary to create oxygen vacancies in the material, both in the bulk and on the (001) surface. This reduction in ΔEv makes the formation of oxygen vacancies easier, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the Fe-doped TiO2 surface.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面的氧原子向待氧化分子的转移而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这增强了催化活性和氧化能力，提供了更多的活性位点用于反应。

2. 铁（Fe）掺杂在钛酸盐（TiO2）中显著降低了材料中氧空位的形成能量，无论是在体相还是（001）表面上。这种ΔEv的降低使得氧空位的形成更加容易，从而增强了Fe掺杂TiO2表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
