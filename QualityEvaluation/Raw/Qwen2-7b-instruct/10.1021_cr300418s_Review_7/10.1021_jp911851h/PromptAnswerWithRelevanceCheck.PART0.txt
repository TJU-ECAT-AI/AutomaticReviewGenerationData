[1] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase."
[2] "The perturbation in the electronic structure is much larger due to the presence of 3d states which results in a high spin state, in agreement with experiment."
[3] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach including spin polarization."
[4] "The oxygen vacancy energy formation is always lower for the surface than for the bulk."
[5] "The presence of Fe strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface."
[6] "This conclusion is likely to be much less dependent on the theoretical method used to describe the electronic structure of these materials and provides additional and independent support to the interpretation of Carrettin et al. (28) for the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxygen vacancy can be easily formed, leading to an increased catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface.

In the context of this study, the presence of iron (Fe) in titanium dioxide (TiO2) significantly reduces the energy needed to create oxygen vacancies, especially on the surface of the material. This reduction in ΔEv enhances the catalytic activity of the oxide surface, particularly for the oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO). The high spin state of the Fe-doped TiO2 also contributes to the enhancement of the material's catalytic performance. The results provide additional support to the interpretation that the enhanced catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 towards CO oxidation is due to the ease of creating oxygen vacancies in the support.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧原子向反应物的转移而发挥作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位可以很容易地形成，从而增加表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

在此研究的背景下，铁（Fe）在二氧化钛（TiO2）中的存在显著降低了创建氧空位所需的能量，尤其是在材料的表面上。这种ΔEv的降低增强了氧化物表面的催化活性，特别是对一氧化碳（CO）的氧化。Fe掺杂的TiO2的高自旋状态也对材料的催化性能的增强做出了贡献。结果提供了额外的支持，解释了在Fe掺杂的TiO2上支持的金纳米粒子对CO氧化增强催化活性的原因是支持体中容易生成氧空位。

[1] "The present results provide additional and independent support to the claim that the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation has its origin in the ease to create oxygen vacancies in the support."
[2] "The oxygen vacancy energy formation (Ef) has been calculated as (1) where E(Ti36O72) is the total energy of the low spin solution for bulk TiO2, using the 3 × 3 × 1 supercell described above, E(O2) is the total energy of a oxygen molecule in the triplet state calculated with the same computational setup used for the oxide, and E(Ti36O71) is the energy of the same supercell with one oxygen removed thus resulting in a TiO1.972 stoichiometry for the reduced system."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because a lower ΔEv facilitates the creation of more oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity by providing more sites for the activation of oxygen and subsequent oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a critical factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies an easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the surface. This is evidenced by the finding that doping titanium dioxide with iron significantly reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy, thereby facilitating oxygen vacancy creation and consequently boosting the catalytic performance, particularly for carbon monoxide oxidation on gold nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped titanium dioxide.
