[1] "The present results provide additional and independent support to the claim that the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation has its origin in the ease to create oxygen vacancies in the support."
[2] "Creation of an oxygen vacancy defect in bulk FeTiO2 results in an elongation of the (FeTi)V distance from 3.875 to 4.132 Å, a structural change similar to that produced in bulk TiO2."
[3] "The oxygen vacancy formation energies Ef calculated in this work for TiO2 and FeTiO2 and summarized in Table 4 confirm that doping with Fe reduces the energy necessary to create an oxygen vacancy in TiO2 by more than 2 eV. And this is true both for the bulk and for the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a critical factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies an easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the surface. This is evidenced by the finding that doping titanium dioxide with iron significantly reduces the oxygen vacancy formation energy, thereby facilitating oxygen vacancy creation and consequently boosting the catalytic performance, particularly for carbon monoxide oxidation on gold nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped titanium dioxide.

火星-范克雷威尔机制通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）作为决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更容易形成，这增强了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一发现表明，向二氧化钛掺入铁可以显著降低氧空位形成能，从而促进氧空位的生成，进而增强催化性能，特别是在金纳米颗粒支持在Fe掺杂的二氧化钛上的碳氧化反应中。
