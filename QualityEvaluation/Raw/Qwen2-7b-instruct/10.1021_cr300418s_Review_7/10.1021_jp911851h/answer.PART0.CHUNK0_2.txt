[1] "The effect of Fe-doping on the oxygen vacancy energy formation and on the electronic structure of stoichiometric bulk and (001) surface of TiO2 anatase has been studied by means of periodic density functional calculations within the GGA+U approach."
[2] "The presence of Fe causes only a minor perturbation of the atomic structure of anatase but strongly reduces the oxygen vacancy energy formation, especially at the surface."
[3] "The present results provide additional and independent support to the claim that the enhanced catalytic activity of Au nanoparticles supported on Fe-doped TiO2 toward CO oxidation has its origin in the ease to create oxygen vacancies in the support."
[4] "Formation of oxygen vacancy defects is easier at surfaces than in the bulk."
[5] "Doping with Fe reduces the energy necessary to create an oxygen vacancy in TiO2 by more than 2 eV. And this is true both for the bulk and for the surface."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, which act as reactive sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reaction with reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as a lower ΔEv facilitates faster and more efficient oxygen vacancy creation, enhancing the surface reactivity and catalytic performance.

Answer: 

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies are more easily formed, leading to increased surface reactivity and enhanced catalytic efficiency.

Chinese Answer:

2. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更容易形成，导致表面反应性增加，并提高催化效率。
