The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the use of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface for the oxidation of reactants. For instance, in alkane activation, the breaking of the CH bond leads to the binding of the H atom and the alkyl group to two oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. To enhance the catalytic activity of lanthanum oxide, it is crucial to lower the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This can be achieved through surface modifications, such as doping with elements whose oxides have lower formation enthalpies or whose valences are lower than that of lanthanum. This reduction in ΔEv facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are more reactive and can bind electrophilic reactants like oxygen. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation acts as a crude indicator of the surface's chemical reactivity and thus influences both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

火星-范雷伦机制涉及到氧化物表面的氧原子用于反应物的氧化。例如，在烷烃激活中，CH键的断裂导致氢原子和烷基团与氧化物表面的两个氧原子结合。为了增强镧系氧化物的催化活性，降低氧空位形成能（ΔEv）至关重要。可以通过表面修改，如使用氧化物形成焓更低或电荷低于镧的元素进行掺杂来实现这一目标。这种ΔEv的降低使氧空位更容易形成，这些空位更为活泼，可以与氧等亲电试剂结合。氧空位形成能的大小是表面化学活性的一个粗略指标，从而影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
