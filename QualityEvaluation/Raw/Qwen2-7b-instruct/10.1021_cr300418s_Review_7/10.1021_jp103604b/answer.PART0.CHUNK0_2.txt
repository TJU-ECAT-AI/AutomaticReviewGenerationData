[1] "Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies."
[2] "Doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[3] "CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[4] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[5] "Doping the surface layer of La2O3 with Cu causes a large atomic rearrangement."
[6] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, where the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxide surface."
[7] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism facilitates oxidation by making it easier for oxygen atoms near dopants to react with reactants. This process involves the oxygen atoms originating from the oxide surface.
2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
