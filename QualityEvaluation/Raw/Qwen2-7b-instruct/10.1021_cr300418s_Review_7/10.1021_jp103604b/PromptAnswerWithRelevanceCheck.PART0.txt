[1] "Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies."
[2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "Doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
[5] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[6] "Doping La2O3 with Cu lowers the energy of vacancy formation the most. This means two things: This system will lose the active oxygen easily to form an oxygen vacancy, which is not eager to adsorb O2 from the gas phase."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide catalyst to oxidize substrates. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lowering ΔEv through doping enhances the surface's ability to form oxygen vacancies, making the oxide more reactive towards oxidation processes. Dopants that lower ΔEv facilitate the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism by enabling the easy removal of oxygen atoms from the surface, thus improving the catalyst's efficiency. Additionally, dopants with a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide can adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, further enhancing the catalyst's oxidizing capability. Copper doping, in particular, significantly reduces ΔEv, leading to the facile formation of oxygen vacancies that are not eager to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase. This results in a system that loses active oxygen easily, forming oxygen vacancies that are not as reactive towards gas-phase oxygen, affecting the overall catalytic activity and efficiency.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by using an oxygen atom from the surface of the oxide to oxidize a reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxygen atoms are more reactive, allowing for easier formation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are then available to bind electrophilic reactants like O2, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

[1] "To improve the activity of lanthanum oxide, we need surface modifications that lower the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the use of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface for the oxidation of reactants. For instance, in alkane activation, the breaking of the CH bond leads to the binding of the H atom and the alkyl group to two oxygen atoms on the oxide surface. To enhance the catalytic activity of lanthanum oxide, it is crucial to lower the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This can be achieved through surface modifications, such as doping with elements whose oxides have lower formation enthalpies or whose valences are lower than that of lanthanum. This reduction in ΔEv facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which are more reactive and can bind electrophilic reactants like oxygen. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation acts as a crude indicator of the surface's chemical reactivity and thus influences both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing an oxygen atom from the surface of the oxide to oxidize a substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen atoms are more reactive and easier to remove, which enhances the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. This is because the oxygen atoms are more prone to engaging in chemical reactions once they are removed from the surface, facilitating the oxidation process. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is thus an indicator of the oxide's potential for catalytic activity. Additionally, the presence of oxygen vacancies can affect the surface chemistry of the oxide, potentially leading to improvements in catalytic performance when conditions favor the formation of a large concentration of vacancies. The mechanism suggests that the activity of the oxide catalyst is closely tied to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, with lower energies correlating to higher catalytic activity.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过使用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化底物而发挥作用。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子更易被去除且活性更高，从而增强了氧化物作为氧化剂的能力。这是因为一旦氧原子从表面上被移除，它们就更容易参与化学反应，促进氧化过程。因此，氧空位的能量决定了氧化物的催化潜力。此外，氧空位的存在可以影响氧化物的表面化学特性，可能在形成大量空位的情况下改善催化性能。机制表明，氧化催化剂的活性与形成氧空位所需能量紧密相关，较低的能量与较高的催化活性相关联。
