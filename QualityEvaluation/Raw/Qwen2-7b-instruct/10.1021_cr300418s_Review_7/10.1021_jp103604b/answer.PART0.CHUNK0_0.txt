[1] "Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies."
[2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "Doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
[5] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[6] "Doping La2O3 with Cu lowers the energy of vacancy formation the most. This means two things: This system will lose the active oxygen easily to form an oxygen vacancy, which is not eager to adsorb O2 from the gas phase."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide catalyst to oxidize substrates. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lowering ΔEv through doping enhances the surface's ability to form oxygen vacancies, making the oxide more reactive towards oxidation processes. Dopants that lower ΔEv facilitate the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism by enabling the easy removal of oxygen atoms from the surface, thus improving the catalyst's efficiency. Additionally, dopants with a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide can adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, further enhancing the catalyst's oxidizing capability. Copper doping, in particular, significantly reduces ΔEv, leading to the facile formation of oxygen vacancies that are not eager to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase. This results in a system that loses active oxygen easily, forming oxygen vacancies that are not as reactive towards gas-phase oxygen, affecting the overall catalytic activity and efficiency.

火星-范雷伦机制在氧化物催化剂介导的氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧原子来氧化底物。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。降低ΔEv通过掺杂增强表面形成氧空位的能力，从而提高氧化过程的效率。掺杂氧原子与所取代阳离子具有更高电荷的掺杂剂能够从气体中吸附氧，进一步增强催化剂的氧化能力。特别是铜掺杂显著降低了ΔEv，导致容易形成氧空位，这些氧空位对气体中的氧并不那么活跃，影响整体催化活性和效率。
