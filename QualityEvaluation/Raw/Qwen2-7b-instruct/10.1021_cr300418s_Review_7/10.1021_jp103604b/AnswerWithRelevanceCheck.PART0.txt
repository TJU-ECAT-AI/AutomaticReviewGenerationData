          [4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
          [5] "For example, (2, 3, 5) for several doped oxides, CO reacts more readily with an oxygen atom near the dopant than it would in the absence of the dopant: doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
          [6] "Doping La2O3 with Cu lowers the energy of vacancy formation the most. This means two things: This system will lose the active oxygen easily to form an oxygen vacancy, which is not eager to adsorb O2 from the gas phase."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the use of oxygen atoms from the surface of the oxide to oxidize substrates. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By lowering ΔEv through doping, the system becomes more reactive, allowing for the easy formation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are then available to bind electrophilic reactants like O2, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, dopants that lower ΔEv facilitate the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism by making it easier for oxygen atoms to be removed from the surface, which in turn improves the catalyst's efficiency. Moreover, dopants with a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide tend to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, further enhancing the catalyst's oxidizing capability. For instance, copper doping in La2O3 significantly reduces ΔEv, leading to facile formation of oxygen vacancies that are not eager to adsorb oxygen from the gas phase, affecting the overall catalytic activity and efficiency.

          在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范雷伦机制通过使用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化底物。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。通过掺杂降低ΔEv，系统变得更加活跃，使得氧空位的形成变得容易。这些空位随后可以与亲电试剂如O2结合，增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。具体来说，降低ΔEv的掺杂剂通过使表面的氧原子更容易被去除来促进火星-范雷伦机制，进而提高了催化剂的效率。此外，与氧化物中取代的阳离子具有更高电荷的掺杂剂倾向于从气体中吸附氧，进一步增强了催化剂的氧化能力。例如，在La2O3中掺杂铜显著降低了ΔEv，导致易于形成对气体中的氧不那么活跃的氧空位，从而影响整体催化活性和效率。

          This question focuses on the impact of doping on the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation (ΔEv) on the (001) and (011) faces of La2O3. The study reveals that doping with elements such as Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, or Al affects ΔEv, which in turn influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Doping, particularly with Fe and Sr, catalyzes methane oxidative coupling, indicating that doping can improve the efficiency of the catalyst. The presence of electrons at the oxygen-vacancy site alters the chemical properties of the defect, impacting its ability to bind electrophilic reactants, such as O2. Furthermore, examining the (001) and (011) faces of La2O3 highlights the potential for different catalytic chemistry across various surfaces, suggesting that the choice of face can significantly influence the performance of the catalyst.

          Improving the activity of lanthanum oxide requires modifications to the surface that lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This is because a lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen atoms are more reactive and easier to remove, which enhances the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, in which the oxygen atom responsible for the oxidation of the reactant originates from the oxide surface, is a key factor in this process. An example of this mechanism in action is the activation of alkanes, where the breaking of the CH bond results in the binding of the H atom and the alkyl group to two oxygen atoms on the surface of the oxide. By reducing ΔEv through surface modifications, we can facilitate the easy formation of oxygen vacancies, which are more reactive and can bind electrophilic reactants like O2, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Our findings confirm that all the dopants tested lower the energy of oxygen vacancy formation significantly, as predicted by the propensity rule.

          提高镧系氧化物的活性需要对表面进行修改，以降低氧空位形成能（ΔEv）。因为较低的ΔEv意味着氧原子更活跃且更容易被移除，从而增强了氧化物作为氧化剂的能力。火星-范雷伦机制，其中负责氧化反应的氧原子源自氧化物表面，是这一过程的关键因素。这一机制的一个例子是在烷烃激活中，CH键的断裂导致H原子和烷基与氧化物表面的两个氧原子结合。通过表面修改降低ΔEv，我们能够促进氧空位的容易形成，这些空位更加活跃，可以与O2等亲电试剂结合，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。我们的研究证实，所有测试的掺杂剂都显著降低了氧空位形成能，正如预测的倾向规则所示。
