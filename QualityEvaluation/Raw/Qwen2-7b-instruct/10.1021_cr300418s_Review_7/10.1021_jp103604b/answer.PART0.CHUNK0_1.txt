[1] "Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies."
[2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "Doping facilitates the Marsvan Krevelen mechanism (6, 7) for oxidation."
[4] "Dopants having a higher valence than the cation they replace in the oxide (e.g., Zn oxide doped with Ti) tend to adsorb O2 from the gas phase and activate it to make it a better oxidant."
[5] "In this article, we study how the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation on the (001) and (011) faces of La2O3 is affected by doping the oxide with Cu, Zn, Mg, Fe, or Al."
[6] "We are interested in La2O3 because it has been used as a catalyst for the oxichlorination of methane, (11) for the destruction of halogenated organic compounds, (12, 13) and for methane oxidative coupling. (14, 15)"
[7] "Lanthanum oxide doped with Fe and Sr catalyzes methane oxidative coupling, (16-18) and doping seems to improve the efficiency of the catalyst."
[8] "The formation of oxygen vacancies has been studied extensively for reducible oxides, in particular, TiO2 and CeO2."
[9] "The presence of these electrons at the oxygen-vacancy site will affect the chemical properties of the defect, especially its ability to bind electrophilic reactants, such as O2."
[10] "We have examined two faces of La2O3 because there is evidence that, in the case of oxides, different faces can have very different catalytic chemistry."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by using an oxygen atom from the surface of the oxide to oxidize a reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies that the oxygen atoms are more reactive, allowing for easier formation of oxygen vacancies. These vacancies are then available to bind electrophilic reactants like O2, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

火星-范雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过使用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化反应物。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子更具反应性，允许更轻松地形成氧空位。这些空位随后可以与亲电试剂如O2结合，增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
