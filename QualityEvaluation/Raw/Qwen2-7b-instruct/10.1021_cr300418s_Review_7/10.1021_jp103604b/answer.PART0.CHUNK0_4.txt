[1] "Some dopants weaken the bond between the oxygen atoms in the surface layer and the oxide, making it easier to make oxygen vacancies."
[2] "The oxygen atoms that are easier to remove are more reactive, and the lowering of the energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is a good descriptor of the extent to which doping makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "For example, for Cu, the distinction is not as clear as for Fe because the enthalpy of formation of CuO is so close to that of Cu2O."
[4] "It is often suggested that, because oxygen vacancies are chemically active, they must play an important role in catalysis."
[5] "However, if the surface with a large vacancy concentration is a better catalyst, the addition of CO will improve performance."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing an oxygen atom from the surface of the oxide to oxidize a substrate. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxygen atoms are more reactive and easier to remove, which enhances the oxide's ability to act as an oxidant. This is because the oxygen atoms are more prone to engaging in chemical reactions once they are removed from the surface, facilitating the oxidation process. The energy of oxygen-vacancy formation is thus an indicator of the oxide's potential for catalytic activity. Additionally, the presence of oxygen vacancies can affect the surface chemistry of the oxide, potentially leading to improvements in catalytic performance when conditions favor the formation of a large concentration of vacancies. The mechanism suggests that the activity of the oxide catalyst is closely tied to the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation, with lower energies correlating to higher catalytic activity.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过使用氧化物表面的氧原子来氧化底物而发挥作用。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）是决定氧化物表面催化活性和氧化能力的关键因素。较低的ΔEv表明氧原子更易被去除且活性更高，从而增强了氧化物作为氧化剂的能力。这是因为一旦氧原子从表面上被移除，它们就更容易参与化学反应，促进氧化过程。因此，氧空位的能量决定了氧化物的催化潜力。此外，氧空位的存在可以影响氧化物的表面化学特性，可能在形成大量空位的情况下改善催化性能。机制表明，氧化催化剂的活性与形成氧空位所需能量紧密相关，较低的能量与较高的催化活性相关联。
