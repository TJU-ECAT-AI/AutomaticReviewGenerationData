[1] "For the CH4 combustion or CO oxidation, whether the CeFeO solid solution behaves better performance than the CeO2Fe2O3 complex oxide, was reported relatively rarely."
[2] "Moreover, the iron oxide formed on the sample surface would lower the surface area, which would also debase the activity of the catalysts."
[3] "The formation of CeFeO solid solution obviously enhances the redox property and increases the surface areas, which should contribute to CH4 oxidation."
[4] "The H2-TPR and CO-TPSR results reveal that more surface oxygen species (including the adsorbed oxygen and active sublattice oxygen) induced by the oxygen vacancy formation and the distorted lattice oxygen for the CeFeO solid solution, would contribute to the CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms between the catalyst surface and the reacting molecules. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This is because oxygen vacancies create sites where oxygen can be adsorbed, and facilitate the electron transfer necessary for the oxidation process. Consequently, the increased surface area and enhanced redox properties due to oxygen vacancy formation and lattice distortion in the CeFeO solid solution contribute to the improved performance in both CH4 oxidation and CO oxidation.

火星-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进催化剂表面与反应分子之间的电子和氧原子转移而发挥作用。氧空位的形成（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这增强了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为氧空位提供了吸附氧的场所，并促进了氧化过程所需的电子转移。因此，由于氧空位形成、晶格畸变以及CeFeO固溶体中表面面积的增加和增强的电化学性质，改善了CH4氧化和CO氧化的性能。
