[1] "Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 solid solution presents superior catalytic performance for CH4 and CO oxidation, while Ce1x Fe x O2 with x > 0.2 shows less active for CO and CH4 oxidation."
[2] "The results of H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CH4-temperature programmed surface reaction (CH4-TPSR) and CO-TPSR reveal that, the surface oxygen of catalyst is relevant to CO oxidation, which was promoted by the oxygen vacancies formed in CeFeO solid solution, while the easier lattice oxygen migration property and the favorable reducibility of the catalysts is responsible for the promoted catalytic performance for CH4 oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy barrier (ΔEv) for the formation of these vacancies influences the reaction kinetics, thereby affecting the efficiency of the oxidation process. Higher ΔEv values result in slower oxygen vacancy formation, potentially decreasing the catalytic activity. Conversely, lower ΔEv values facilitate faster oxygen vacancy formation, leading to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This mechanism is significant in understanding and optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in various oxidation reactions, such as the oxidation of methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO).

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。氧空位在增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。形成这些空位的能量壁垒（ΔEv）影响反应动力学，从而影响氧化过程的效率。较高的ΔEv值导致氧空位形成较慢，可能降低催化剂活性。相反，较低的ΔEv值促进氧空位更快地形成，从而增加催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制对于理解和优化各种氧化反应中氧化物催化剂的性能具有重要意义。
