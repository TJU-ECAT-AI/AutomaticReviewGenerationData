[1] "Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 solid solution presents superior catalytic performance for CH4 and CO oxidation, while Ce1x Fe x O2 with x > 0.2 shows less active for CO and CH4 oxidation."
[2] "The results of H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CH4-temperature programmed surface reaction (CH4-TPSR) and CO-TPSR reveal that, the surface oxygen of catalyst is relevant to CO oxidation, which was promoted by the oxygen vacancies formed in CeFeO solid solution, while the easier lattice oxygen migration property and the favorable reducibility of the catalysts is responsible for the promoted catalytic performance for CH4 oxidation."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy barrier (ΔEv) for the formation of these vacancies influences the reaction kinetics, thereby affecting the efficiency of the oxidation process. Higher ΔEv values result in slower oxygen vacancy formation, potentially decreasing the catalytic activity. Conversely, lower ΔEv values facilitate faster oxygen vacancy formation, leading to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power. This mechanism is significant in understanding and optimizing the performance of oxide catalysts in various oxidation reactions, such as the oxidation of methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO).

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。氧空位在增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。形成这些空位的能量壁垒（ΔEv）影响反应动力学，从而影响氧化过程的效率。较高的ΔEv值导致氧空位形成较慢，可能降低催化剂活性。相反，较低的ΔEv值促进氧空位更快地形成，从而增加催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制对于理解和优化各种氧化反应中氧化物催化剂的性能具有重要意义。

[1] "For the CH4 combustion or CO oxidation, whether the CeFeO solid solution behaves better performance than the CeO2Fe2O3 complex oxide, was reported relatively rarely."
[2] "Moreover, the iron oxide formed on the sample surface would lower the surface area, which would also debase the activity of the catalysts."
[3] "The formation of CeFeO solid solution obviously enhances the redox property and increases the surface areas, which should contribute to CH4 oxidation."
[4] "The H2-TPR and CO-TPSR results reveal that more surface oxygen species (including the adsorbed oxygen and active sublattice oxygen) induced by the oxygen vacancy formation and the distorted lattice oxygen for the CeFeO solid solution, would contribute to the CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms between the catalyst surface and the reacting molecules. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv signifies easier oxygen vacancy formation, which enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This is because oxygen vacancies create sites where oxygen can be adsorbed, and facilitate the electron transfer necessary for the oxidation process. Consequently, the increased surface area and enhanced redox properties due to oxygen vacancy formation and lattice distortion in the CeFeO solid solution contribute to the improved performance in both CH4 oxidation and CO oxidation.

火星-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进催化剂表面与反应分子之间的电子和氧原子转移而发挥作用。氧空位的形成（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，这增强了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这是因为氧空位提供了吸附氧的场所，并促进了氧化过程所需的电子转移。因此，由于氧空位形成、晶格畸变以及CeFeO固溶体中表面面积的增加和增强的电化学性质，改善了CH4氧化和CO氧化的性能。

[2] "The formation of CeFeO solid solution can increase obviously the surface area of ceria, and promote the redox property of the sample."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the surface oxygen species and oxygen vacancies on the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the formation of oxygen vacancies becomes energetically favorable, leading to an increase in the surface area and the redox activity of the oxide. This enhancement in surface area and redox property facilitates the adsorption and activation of reactants, thereby boosting the catalytic performance for oxidation reactions. Conversely, if the concentration of Fe in the Ce1x Fe x O2 sample exceeds 0.2, part of the Fe aggregates on the surface of the sample, blocking the oxygen activation of MO bonds and decreasing the redox property of the catalyst. This results in a decline in catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the reduced availability of active sites and the impaired oxygen mobility on the surface.

[1] "The catalytic combustion of methane and CO oxidation has been studied extensively in recent decades owing to the energy utilization and environmental requirements."
[2] "For the total oxidation of methane and CO oxidation, the supported noble metal catalysts present an excellent activity [1, 2]."
[3] "However, the noble metal catalysts are not fully satisfactory owing to the high price and scarce resources."
[4] "Recently, the ceria-based catalysts have drawn much attention as a substitute or part substitute for the noble metal catalysts owing to their low cost and good performance for the oxidation reaction [3, 4]."
[5] "It is well-known that the redox property and the lattice oxygen mobility of CeO2 can be profoundly improved by the substitution of Ce4+ with other trivalent ions (Pr3+ and Tb3+) or smaller homovalent ions (Zr4+) [7, 8]."
[6] "Given the effects of trivalent ion and smaller size on the structure and properties of ceria, considerable scientific interest is focused on introducing Fe3+ ions into the ceria lattice [9]."
[7] "It was found that Fe substitution of Ce in CeO2 can distort the sublattice oxygen to promote an activation of lattice oxygen, which is responsible for the better CO oxidation [10]."
[8] "The results of H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CH4-temperature programmed surface reaction (CH4-TPSR) and CO-TPSR reveal that, the surface oxygen of catalyst is relevant to CO oxidation, which was promoted by the oxygen vacancies formed in CeFeO solid solution, while the easier lattice oxygen migration property and the favorable reducibility of the catalysts is responsible for the promoted catalytic performance for CH4 oxidation."
[9] "The density functional theory (DFT) calculations [10] showed that the oxygen sublattice was highly distorted in Fe doped CeO2 which led to formation of long and short MO (M = Fe, Ce) bonds, and the presence of longer oxygen bonds could improve an activation of lattice oxygen."
[10] "Moreover, the iron oxide formed on the sample surface would lower the surface area, which would also debase the activity of the catalysts."
[11] "Therefore, the improving performance of CeFeO solid solution for the CH4 oxidation should be because of the promoted oxygen mobility and the facile redox property of the CeFeO solid solution."

This energy plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When Fe3+ ions are introduced into the ceria lattice, they distort the sublattice oxygen, leading to an activation of lattice oxygen. This activation is responsible for enhancing CO oxidation. The oxygen vacancies formed in the CeFeO solid solution contribute to CO oxidation by providing active sites. The ease of lattice oxygen migration and the favorable reducibility of the catalysts are key factors in promoting CH4 oxidation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the presence of longer oxygen bonds due to Fe doping improves the activation of lattice oxygen. However, the formation of iron oxide on the surface lowers the surface area, potentially reducing the activity of the catalysts. The improved catalytic performance of CeFeO solid solutions in CH4 oxidation is attributed to the enhanced oxygen mobility and facile redox property of the solid solution.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。这种能量在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。当向铈氧化物晶格中引入Fe3+离子时，它们会扭曲子晶格氧，导致晶格氧激活。这种激活对于增强CO氧化至关重要。在CeFeO固溶体中形成的氧空位对CO氧化有贡献，因为它们提供了活性位点。催化剂的晶格氧迁移的便利性和有利的还原性是促进CH4氧化的关键因素。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，由于Fe掺杂，氧键的存在增强了晶格氧的激活。然而，表面形成的铁氧化物降低了表面面积，可能降低了催化剂的活性。CeFeO固溶体在CH4氧化中的改进催化性能归因于固溶体中增强的氧流动性和易于还原性。
