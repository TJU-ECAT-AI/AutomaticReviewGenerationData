[1] "The catalytic combustion of methane and CO oxidation has been studied extensively in recent decades owing to the energy utilization and environmental requirements."
[2] "For the total oxidation of methane and CO oxidation, the supported noble metal catalysts present an excellent activity [1, 2]."
[3] "However, the noble metal catalysts are not fully satisfactory owing to the high price and scarce resources."
[4] "Recently, the ceria-based catalysts have drawn much attention as a substitute or part substitute for the noble metal catalysts owing to their low cost and good performance for the oxidation reaction [3, 4]."
[5] "It is well-known that the redox property and the lattice oxygen mobility of CeO2 can be profoundly improved by the substitution of Ce4+ with other trivalent ions (Pr3+ and Tb3+) or smaller homovalent ions (Zr4+) [7, 8]."
[6] "Given the effects of trivalent ion and smaller size on the structure and properties of ceria, considerable scientific interest is focused on introducing Fe3+ ions into the ceria lattice [9]."
[7] "It was found that Fe substitution of Ce in CeO2 can distort the sublattice oxygen to promote an activation of lattice oxygen, which is responsible for the better CO oxidation [10]."
[8] "The results of H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), CH4-temperature programmed surface reaction (CH4-TPSR) and CO-TPSR reveal that, the surface oxygen of catalyst is relevant to CO oxidation, which was promoted by the oxygen vacancies formed in CeFeO solid solution, while the easier lattice oxygen migration property and the favorable reducibility of the catalysts is responsible for the promoted catalytic performance for CH4 oxidation."
[9] "The density functional theory (DFT) calculations [10] showed that the oxygen sublattice was highly distorted in Fe doped CeO2 which led to formation of long and short MO (M = Fe, Ce) bonds, and the presence of longer oxygen bonds could improve an activation of lattice oxygen."
[10] "Moreover, the iron oxide formed on the sample surface would lower the surface area, which would also debase the activity of the catalysts."
[11] "Therefore, the improving performance of CeFeO solid solution for the CH4 oxidation should be because of the promoted oxygen mobility and the facile redox property of the CeFeO solid solution."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. This energy plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When Fe3+ ions are introduced into the ceria lattice, they distort the sublattice oxygen, leading to an activation of lattice oxygen. This activation is responsible for enhancing CO oxidation. The oxygen vacancies formed in the CeFeO solid solution contribute to CO oxidation by providing active sites. The ease of lattice oxygen migration and the favorable reducibility of the catalysts are key factors in promoting CH4 oxidation. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the presence of longer oxygen bonds due to Fe doping improves the activation of lattice oxygen. However, the formation of iron oxide on the surface lowers the surface area, potentially reducing the activity of the catalysts. The improved catalytic performance of CeFeO solid solutions in CH4 oxidation is attributed to the enhanced oxygen mobility and facile redox property of the solid solution.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。这种能量在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。当向铈氧化物晶格中引入Fe3+离子时，它们会扭曲子晶格氧，导致晶格氧激活。这种激活对于增强CO氧化至关重要。在CeFeO固溶体中形成的氧空位对CO氧化有贡献，因为它们提供了活性位点。催化剂的晶格氧迁移的便利性和有利的还原性是促进CH4氧化的关键因素。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算表明，由于Fe掺杂，氧键的存在增强了晶格氧的激活。然而，表面形成的铁氧化物降低了表面面积，可能降低了催化剂的活性。CeFeO固溶体在CH4氧化中的改进催化性能归因于固溶体中增强的氧流动性和易于还原性。
