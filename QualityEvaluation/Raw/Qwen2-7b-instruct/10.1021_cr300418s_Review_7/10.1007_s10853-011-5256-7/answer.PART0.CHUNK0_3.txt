[1] "The catalytic properties of CeFeO solid solutions for the oxidation of CH4 and CO have been investigated."
[2] "Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 solid solution presents superior catalytic performance for CH4 and CO oxidation, while Ce1x Fe x O2 with x > 0.2 shows less active for CO and CH4 oxidation."
[3] "The formation of CeFeO solid solution obviously enhances the redox property and increases the surface areas, which should contribute to CH4 oxidation."
[4] "And the more surface oxygen species formed in the solid solution are propitious to CO oxidation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to facilitate the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms between the oxide surface and the reacting molecules. This energy barrier determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the oxide surface can easily generate and participate in the redox reactions, leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a high ΔEv reduces the surface activity and thus diminishes the catalytic performance and oxidizing capability of the oxide.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来促进氧化物表面与反应分子之间的电子和氧原子转移。这个能量壁垒决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当ΔEv较低时，氧化物表面可以容易地生成并参与还原反应，从而提高催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv降低了表面活性，从而减少了催化剂的性能和氧化能力。
