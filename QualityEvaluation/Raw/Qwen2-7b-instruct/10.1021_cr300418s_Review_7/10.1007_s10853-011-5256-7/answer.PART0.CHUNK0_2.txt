[1] "Ce0.9Fe0.1O2 solid solution presents superior catalytic performance for CH4 and CO oxidation, while Ce1x Fe x O2 with x > 0.2 shows less active for CO and CH4 oxidation."
[2] "The formation of CeFeO solid solution can increase obviously the surface area of ceria, and promote the redox property of the sample."
[3] "As x > 0.2, part of Fe in the form of iron oxide would aggregate on the sample surface and block the oxygen activation of MO bond, resulting in a decrease in the redox property."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the surface oxygen species and oxygen vacancies on the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the formation of oxygen vacancies becomes energetically favorable, leading to an increase in the surface area and the redox activity of the oxide. This enhancement in surface area and redox property facilitates the adsorption and activation of reactants, thereby boosting the catalytic performance for oxidation reactions. Conversely, if the concentration of Fe in the Ce1x Fe x O2 sample exceeds 0.2, part of the Fe aggregates on the surface of the sample, blocking the oxygen activation of MO bonds and decreasing the redox property of the catalyst. This results in a decline in catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the reduced availability of active sites and the impaired oxygen mobility on the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧物种和氧空位起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。当ΔEv较低时，氧空位的形成变得有利，导致表面面积和氧化物的还原性质的增加。这增强了表面活性，促进了反应物的吸附和活化，从而提高了催化性能。相反，如果Ce1x Fe x O2样品中Fe的浓度超过0.2，部分Fe会在样品表面聚集，阻塞MO键的氧激活，从而降低催化剂的还原性质。这导致催化活性和氧化能力下降，因为活性位点的可用性减少且表面的氧流动性受损。
