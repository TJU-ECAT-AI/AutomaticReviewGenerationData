The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen is abstracted from the reactant and then recombined with other reactants to form products. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more efficient oxygen vacancy formation, which is indicative of enhanced catalytic activity and stronger oxidizing capability. This parameter essentially governs how easily the surface can release oxygen for reaction, affecting the overall efficiency of the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作，其中从反应物中提取氧然后与其他反应物重新结合形成产物。氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv表明氧气空位形成更为有效，这预示着增强的催化活性和更强的氧化能力。这一参数本质上控制着表面释放氧气的能力，影响整个氧化过程的效率。
