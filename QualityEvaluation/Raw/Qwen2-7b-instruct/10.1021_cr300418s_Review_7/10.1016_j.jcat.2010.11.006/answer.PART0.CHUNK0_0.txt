The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv signifies the energy needed for the creation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface. This energy is crucial because it affects how efficiently the oxide surface can participate in oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values indicate a higher probability of oxygen vacancies being formed, which can enhance the surface's ability to oxidize molecules effectively. Thus, the ΔEv plays a key role in the efficiency of the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism by influencing the surface's reactivity and selectivity in oxidative processes.
