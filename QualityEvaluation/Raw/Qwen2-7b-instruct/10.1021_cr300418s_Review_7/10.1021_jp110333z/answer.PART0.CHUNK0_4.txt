[1] "We document two rules. (1) The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2) Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[2] "On an oxide doped with an LVD, it is much easier (than on the undoped oxide) to remove an oxygen atom from the surface to form 1/2 O2 in the gas phase and an oxygen vacancy on the surface."
[3] "Furthermore, H and CH3 bind much more strongly to an oxide doped with an LVD than on the undoped oxide."
[4] "Finally, the energy produced by the dissociative adsorption of methane on an oxide doped with an LVD (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide) is much larger than on the undoped oxide."
[5] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface."
[6] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive."
[7] "The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[8] "In the case of LaCeO2 the molecular orbital in question is delocalized and consists mainly of oxygen atomic orbitals. This is why doping with La equally affects the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell used for calculations."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a key factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. An easier formation of an oxygen vacancy (lower ΔEv) indicates a higher activity and stronger oxidizing power due to the increased reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms.

2. The presence of a dopant in an oxide significantly enhances its ability to act as an oxidant. This is because the dopant introduces a lower valence state, creating an electron deficit in the surface layer, which leads to weaker bonds between the oxygen atoms and the surface. This results in an easier removal of oxygen atoms to form oxygen vacancies and increased reactivity.

3. When an electron donor is adsorbed onto the surface of an oxide doped with a low valence dopant (LVD), it counteracts the effect of the dopant by healing the electron deficit. This strengthens the bond between the oxygen atoms and the surface, making the oxide less reactive.

4. The energy required for the dissociative adsorption of methane (ΔECH4) on an oxide doped with an LVD is much higher than on an undoped oxide. This is attributed to the enhanced reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms due to the dopant.

5. An LVD creates an electron deficit on the surface of the oxide because of its lower valence state compared to the substituted cation. This leads to weaker bonds between the oxygen atoms and the surface.

6. By adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide surface, the electron deficit is partially or fully healed, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond and making the oxide less reactive. This phenomenon is referred to as the chemical compensation effect.

7. The presence of a low valence dopant on the oxide surface introduces a partially filled orbital in the valence band. The adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, resulting in a density of states similar to that of the undoped oxide surface.

8. In the case of LaCeO2, the molecular orbital influenced by the LVD is delocalized and consists predominantly of oxygen atomic orbitals. This characteristic enables the LVD to equally affect the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell utilized for calculations.

1. 马斯-范克雷维尔机制通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。氧空位更容易形成（ΔEv较低）表明活动性更强，氧化能力更强大，因为表面氧原子的反应性增强。

2. 在氧化物中添加掺杂剂显著增强了其作为氧化剂的能力。这是因为掺杂剂引入了较低的电荷状态，导致表面层中的电子缺陷，从而导致氧原子与表面之间的较弱键。这导致氧原子更易从表面移除以形成氧空位，并增加了表面的反应性。

3. 当在含有低电荷掺杂剂（LVD）的氧化物表面上吸附一个电子供体时，它通过修复电子缺陷来抵消掺杂剂的作用。这加强了氧原子与表面之间的结合，使氧化物变得不那么活跃。

4. 含有LVD的氧化物表面上，甲烷的解离吸附（ΔECH4）的能量比不含掺杂剂的氧化物高得多。这是由于表面氧原子活性增强所致。

5. LVD在氧化物表面上由于其较低的电荷状态与取代的离子相比，造成电子缺陷。这导致氧原子与表面之间的较弱键。

6. 在含LVD的氧化物表面上吸附一个电子供体，部分或完全修复了电子缺陷，增强了氧键，使氧化物变得不那么活跃。这种现象被称为化学补偿效应。

7. 含有低电荷掺杂剂的氧化物表面引入了价带中的部分填充轨道。吸附的补偿电子供体填满了这个轨道，导致补偿表面的能级密度与未掺杂的氧化物表面相似。

8. 对于LaCeO2而言，受LVD影响的分子轨道是去耦合的，并且主要由氧原子轨道组成。这一特性使得LVD能够等效地影响超单元中所有氧原子的活性。
