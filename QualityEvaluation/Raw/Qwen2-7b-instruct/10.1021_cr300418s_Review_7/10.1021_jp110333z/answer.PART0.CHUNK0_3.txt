[1] "The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[2] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[3] "We document two rules. (1) The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant. (2) Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[4] "The energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface; the binding energies ΔEH and ΔECH3 of a H atom or a CH3 radical to a surface oxygen atom; and the energy ΔECH4 of dissociative adsorption of methane (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group)."
[5] "The calculations presented here also show that when a H atom or a CH3 radical are adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, the chemistry of the surface becomes very similar to that of the undoped oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a key indicator of both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove an oxygen atom from the surface, facilitating the formation of reactive intermediates such as hydroxyls and methoxides. This, in turn, enhances the oxidative capacity of the surface. The presence of a dopant lowers ΔEv, making the surface a better oxidant. Conversely, adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts the effect of the dopant, increasing ΔEv and reducing the reactivity of the surface. This chemical compensation effect plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of the oxide catalyst in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用表面氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）作为判断催化剂活性和氧化能力的关键指标。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易从表面上移除一个氧原子，从而促进形成如羟基和甲氧基等活性中间体，增强表面的氧化能力。掺杂剂的存在降低了ΔEv，使表面成为更好的氧化剂。相反，在表面上吸附电子供体可以抵消掺杂剂的影响，增加ΔEv并降低表面的活性。这种化学补偿效应在确定氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的效率方面起着关键作用。
