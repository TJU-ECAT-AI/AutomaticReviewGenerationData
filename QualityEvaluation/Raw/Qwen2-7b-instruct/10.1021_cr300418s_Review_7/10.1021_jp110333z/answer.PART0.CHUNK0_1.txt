[1] "The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[2] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[3] "In all examples that we have examined, the presence of an LVD in the surface of an oxide makes ΔEv much smaller and ΔEH, ΔECH3, and ΔECH4 much larger than in the case of the undoped oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from an adsorbed species to the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an LVD dopant is present, it creates an electron deficit in its vicinity, causing the oxygen atoms in the surface layer to bind more weakly to the doped oxide than to the undoped one. This results in an easier formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface. Additionally, the presence of an LVD dopant makes it easier for a hydrogen atom or a CH3 radical to bind to the surface oxygen atom, and it facilitates the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group. The dopant's effect on the surface oxygen atoms is counteracted by adsorbing an electron donor on the surface, which heals the electron deficit and makes the oxygen bond stronger, reducing the reactivity of the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过促进吸附物种向氧化物催化剂表面的电子转移而起作用。表面氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。当存在LVD掺杂剂时，它在其附近产生电子缺陷，导致表面层中的氧原子与掺杂的氧化物相比与未掺杂的氧化物结合得更弱。这导致表面更容易形成氧空位。此外，掺杂剂的存在使氢原子或CH3自由基与表面氧原子的结合更加容易，并且有利于甲烷的解离吸附以形成羟基和甲氧基团。掺杂剂对表面氧原子的影响可以通过在表面上吸附电子供体来抵消，这可以治愈电子缺陷并使氧键更强，降低表面的反应性。
