[1] "For example, examination of the energy of making a surface oxygen vacancy in the top oxygen layer of CeO2(111) (row 1, column 3 of Table 1) is 3.00 eV. The energy of making an oxygen vacancy on LaCeO2(111), at the position shown in Figure 1b (ignore the H atom present in that figure), is 1.36 eV (row 3, column 3 of Table 1)."
[2] "It is striking how little ΔECH4 changes with the position of the compensating H atom (see Table 3)."
[3] "The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[4] "Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."

1. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) on ceria (CeO2) is 3.00 eV, whereas on ceria doped with lanthanum (LaCeO2), it is significantly lower at 1.36 eV. This indicates that the presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant, facilitating easier oxygen vacancy formation.

2. The energy ΔECH4, which measures the energy to dissociate methane on the surface, remains remarkably consistent despite changes in the position of the compensating hydrogen atom. This demonstrates the robustness of the chemical compensation effect across different positions.

3. The introduction of a lower-valence dopant on the oxide surface creates an electron deficit, causing the oxygen atoms to bind more weakly to the doped oxide. This electron deficit is neutralized by adsorbing an electron donor, which alters the electronic structure of the surface, making it similar to the undoped oxide.

4. According to the EvansPolanyi rules, which relate the energy barriers for chemical reactions, oxides doped with LVD1s should exhibit lower activation energies for methane activation compared to undoped oxides. This implies enhanced catalytic activity for methane activation due to the effects of the dopant on oxygen activity and the subsequent chemical compensation.

1. 氧化铈（CeO2）表面形成氧空位的能量（ΔEv）为3.00 eV，而镧掺杂氧化铈（LaCeO2）表面的该能量显著降低至1.36 eV。这表明掺杂剂的存在使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，使得氧空位的形成更加容易。

2. 表征甲烷解离所需的能量ΔECH4，在补偿氢原子位置变化时保持相对稳定。这说明化学补偿效应在不同位置上具有很强的稳定性。

3. 在氧化物表面引入低电荷价态的掺杂剂会产生电子缺陷，导致表面的氧原子与掺杂氧化物的结合力减弱。这一电子缺陷通过吸附电子供体得到中和，改变表面的电子结构，使其与未掺杂的氧化物相似。

4. 根据埃文斯-波兰蒂规则，对于甲烷激活，掺杂有LVD1的氧化物应比未掺杂的氧化物具有更低的活化能。这意味着由于掺杂剂对氧活性的影响及其后续的化学补偿作用，掺杂氧化物的催化活性增强，更适合甲烷激活反应。
