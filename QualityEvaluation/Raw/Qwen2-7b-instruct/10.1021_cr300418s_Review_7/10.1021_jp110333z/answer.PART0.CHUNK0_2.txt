[1] "We use density functional theory to study the chemistry of oxides doped substitutionally with cations having lower valence than that of the host."
[2] "The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[3] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."
[4] "We characterize the reactivity of the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide by four quantities: the energy ΔEv to make an oxygen vacancy in the surface."
[5] "The calculations presented here also show that when a H atom or a CH3 radical are adsorbed on the surface of an oxide doped with an LVD, the chemistry of the surface becomes very similar to that of the undoped oxide."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for this process, ΔEv, is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The presence of a dopant in the oxide decreases this energy, making the surface a more efficient oxidant. Adsorbing an electron donor onto the surface can counteract the effect of the dopant, stabilizing the surface and maintaining its oxidizing ability. This process is significant because it allows for the control of the surface chemistry and activity, enhancing the efficiency of the oxide catalyst in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的操作通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位。表面所需的能量，ΔEv，在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。掺杂剂在氧化物中的存在降低了这一能量，使表面成为更高效的氧化剂。吸附电子供体到表面上可以抵消掺杂剂的作用，稳定表面并保持其氧化能力。这一过程非常重要，因为它允许控制表面化学和活性，提高氧化催化剂在氧化反应中的效率。
