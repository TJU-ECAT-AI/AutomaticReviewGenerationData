[1] "For example, examination of the energy of making a surface oxygen vacancy in the top oxygen layer of CeO2(111) (row 1, column 3 of Table 1) is 3.00 eV. The energy of making an oxygen vacancy on LaCeO2(111), at the position shown in Figure 1b (ignore the H atom present in that figure), is 1.36 eV (row 3, column 3 of Table 1)."
[2] "It is striking how little ΔECH4 changes with the position of the compensating H atom (see Table 3)."
[3] "The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide."
[4] "Assuming that the EvansPolanyi rules work for this case, this will lower the activation energy for breaking the CH bond and oxides doped with LVD1 should be better catalysts for methane activation than the undoped oxides."

1. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) on ceria (CeO2) is 3.00 eV, whereas on ceria doped with lanthanum (LaCeO2), it is significantly lower at 1.36 eV. This indicates that the presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant, facilitating easier oxygen vacancy formation.

2. The energy ΔECH4, which measures the energy to dissociate methane on the surface, remains remarkably consistent despite changes in the position of the compensating hydrogen atom. This demonstrates the robustness of the chemical compensation effect across different positions.

3. The introduction of a lower-valence dopant on the oxide surface creates an electron deficit, causing the oxygen atoms to bind more weakly to the doped oxide. This electron deficit is neutralized by adsorbing an electron donor, which alters the electronic structure of the surface, making it similar to the undoped oxide.

4. According to the EvansPolanyi rules, which relate the energy barriers for chemical reactions, oxides doped with LVD1s should exhibit lower activation energies for methane activation compared to undoped oxides. This implies enhanced catalytic activity for methane activation due to the effects of the dopant on oxygen activity and the subsequent chemical compensation.

1. 氧化铈（CeO2）表面形成氧空位的能量（ΔEv）为3.00 eV，而镧掺杂氧化铈（LaCeO2）表面的该能量显著降低至1.36 eV。这表明掺杂剂的存在使氧化物成为更好的氧化剂，使得氧空位的形成更加容易。

2. 表征甲烷解离所需的能量ΔECH4，在补偿氢原子位置变化时保持相对稳定。这说明化学补偿效应在不同位置上具有很强的稳定性。

3. 在氧化物表面引入低电荷价态的掺杂剂会产生电子缺陷，导致表面的氧原子与掺杂氧化物的结合力减弱。这一电子缺陷通过吸附电子供体得到中和，改变表面的电子结构，使其与未掺杂的氧化物相似。

4. 根据埃文斯-波兰蒂规则，对于甲烷激活，掺杂有LVD1的氧化物应比未掺杂的氧化物具有更低的活化能。这意味着由于掺杂剂对氧活性的影响及其后续的化学补偿作用，掺杂氧化物的催化活性增强，更适合甲烷激活反应。

[1] "The presence of the dopant makes the oxide a better oxidant."
[2] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts strongly the effect of the dopant."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from an adsorbed species to the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When an LVD dopant is present, it creates an electron deficit in its vicinity, causing the oxygen atoms in the surface layer to bind more weakly to the doped oxide than to the undoped one. This results in an easier formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface. Additionally, the presence of an LVD dopant makes it easier for a hydrogen atom or a CH3 radical to bind to the surface oxygen atom, and it facilitates the dissociative adsorption of methane to form a hydroxyl and a methoxy group. The dopant's effect on the surface oxygen atoms is counteracted by adsorbing an electron donor on the surface, which heals the electron deficit and makes the oxygen bond stronger, reducing the reactivity of the surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过促进吸附物种向氧化物催化剂表面的电子转移而起作用。表面氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。当存在LVD掺杂剂时，它在其附近产生电子缺陷，导致表面层中的氧原子与掺杂的氧化物相比与未掺杂的氧化物结合得更弱。这导致表面更容易形成氧空位。此外，掺杂剂的存在使氢原子或CH3自由基与表面氧原子的结合更加容易，并且有利于甲烷的解离吸附以形成羟基和甲氧基团。掺杂剂对表面氧原子的影响可以通过在表面上吸附电子供体来抵消，这可以治愈电子缺陷并使氧键更强，降低表面的反应性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for this process, ΔEv, is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The presence of a dopant in the oxide decreases this energy, making the surface a more efficient oxidant. Adsorbing an electron donor onto the surface can counteract the effect of the dopant, stabilizing the surface and maintaining its oxidizing ability. This process is significant because it allows for the control of the surface chemistry and activity, enhancing the efficiency of the oxide catalyst in oxidation reactions.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a key indicator of both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that it is easier to remove an oxygen atom from the surface, facilitating the formation of reactive intermediates such as hydroxyls and methoxides. This, in turn, enhances the oxidative capacity of the surface. The presence of a dopant lowers ΔEv, making the surface a better oxidant. Conversely, adsorbing an electron donor on the surface counteracts the effect of the dopant, increasing ΔEv and reducing the reactivity of the surface. This chemical compensation effect plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of the oxide catalyst in oxidation reactions.

[4] "Finally, the energy produced by the dissociative adsorption of methane on an oxide doped with an LVD (to form a hydroxyl and a methoxide) is much larger than on the undoped oxide."
[5] "The reason for this chemical compensation effect can be understood as follows: having a lower valence than the cation it substitutes, an LVD creates a deficit of electrons in the surface."
[6] "Adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide heals (in full or in part) the electron deficit, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond to the oxide and making it less reactive."
[7] "The presence of an LVD on the surface produces a partially filled orbital in the valence band and the adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, making the density of states of the compensated surface very similar to that of the undoped oxide."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) as a key factor in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. An easier formation of an oxygen vacancy (lower ΔEv) indicates a higher activity and stronger oxidizing power due to the increased reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms.

2. The presence of a dopant in an oxide significantly enhances its ability to act as an oxidant. This is because the dopant introduces a lower valence state, creating an electron deficit in the surface layer, which leads to weaker bonds between the oxygen atoms and the surface. This results in an easier removal of oxygen atoms to form oxygen vacancies and increased reactivity.

3. When an electron donor is adsorbed onto the surface of an oxide doped with a low valence dopant (LVD), it counteracts the effect of the dopant by healing the electron deficit. This strengthens the bond between the oxygen atoms and the surface, making the oxide less reactive.

4. The energy required for the dissociative adsorption of methane (ΔECH4) on an oxide doped with an LVD is much higher than on an undoped oxide. This is attributed to the enhanced reactivity of the surface oxygen atoms due to the dopant.

5. An LVD creates an electron deficit on the surface of the oxide because of its lower valence state compared to the substituted cation. This leads to weaker bonds between the oxygen atoms and the surface.

6. By adsorbing an electron donor on the doped oxide surface, the electron deficit is partially or fully healed, increasing the strength of the oxygen bond and making the oxide less reactive. This phenomenon is referred to as the chemical compensation effect.

7. The presence of a low valence dopant on the oxide surface introduces a partially filled orbital in the valence band. The adsorption of a compensating electron donor fills this orbital, resulting in a density of states similar to that of the undoped oxide surface.

8. In the case of LaCeO2, the molecular orbital influenced by the LVD is delocalized and consists predominantly of oxygen atomic orbitals. This characteristic enables the LVD to equally affect the reactivity of all oxygen atoms in the supercell utilized for calculations.

1. 马斯-范克雷维尔机制通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。氧空位更容易形成（ΔEv较低）表明活动性更强，氧化能力更强大，因为表面氧原子的反应性增强。

2. 在氧化物中添加掺杂剂显著增强了其作为氧化剂的能力。这是因为掺杂剂引入了较低的电荷状态，导致表面层中的电子缺陷，从而导致氧原子与表面之间的较弱键。这导致氧原子更易从表面移除以形成氧空位，并增加了表面的反应性。

3. 当在含有低电荷掺杂剂（LVD）的氧化物表面上吸附一个电子供体时，它通过修复电子缺陷来抵消掺杂剂的作用。这加强了氧原子与表面之间的结合，使氧化物变得不那么活跃。

4. 含有LVD的氧化物表面上，甲烷的解离吸附（ΔECH4）的能量比不含掺杂剂的氧化物高得多。这是由于表面氧原子活性增强所致。

5. LVD在氧化物表面上由于其较低的电荷状态与取代的离子相比，造成电子缺陷。这导致氧原子与表面之间的较弱键。

6. 在含LVD的氧化物表面上吸附一个电子供体，部分或完全修复了电子缺陷，增强了氧键，使氧化物变得不那么活跃。这种现象被称为化学补偿效应。

7. 含有低电荷掺杂剂的氧化物表面引入了价带中的部分填充轨道。吸附的补偿电子供体填满了这个轨道，导致补偿表面的能级密度与未掺杂的氧化物表面相似。

8. 对于LaCeO2而言，受LVD影响的分子轨道是去耦合的，并且主要由氧原子轨道组成。这一特性使得LVD能够等效地影响超单元中所有氧原子的活性。
