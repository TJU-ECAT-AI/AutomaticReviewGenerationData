1. A linear relationship between the activation energy for dissociative chemisorption and the reaction energy has been established for multiple molecules, suggesting a Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship exists for surface reactions. This relationship has been confirmed for a variety of catalysts, especially with the use of extensive density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.

2. The linear relationship between the activation energy for dissociative chemisorption and the reaction energy has been confirmed for a variety of molecules, indicating that this Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationship applies to surface reactions. This relationship has been explicitly verified for certain catalysts in a few instances. However, it was only with extensive use of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations that this relationship became firmly established.

2. 对于多种分子的解吸附化学吸附，激活能与反应能量之间存在线性关系，这表明表面反应中确实存在Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi（BEP）关系。这一关系在少数情况下已被特定催化剂验证。然而，只有通过广泛使用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算，这一关系才被牢固地确定下来。
