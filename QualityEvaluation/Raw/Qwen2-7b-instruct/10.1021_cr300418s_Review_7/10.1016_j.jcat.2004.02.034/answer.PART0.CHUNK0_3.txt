[1] "We have synthesized a series of supported catalysts and determined their activity toward CO methanation. It is found that the measured activity plotted against the calculated dissociative CO chemisorption energy results in a very nice volcano curve with a maximum in the universal range [8] proposed by our analysis."

[1] "It is interesting to note that the volcano curves generated from the BEP relations are broad—a typical width is of the order 1 eV; see Fig. 7. Whereas the rates of the individual elementary steps vary on a thermal energy scale (an order of magnitude in rate corresponds roughly to an energy of 2kBT ), the net rate varies much more slowly. This is a direct consequence of the fact that around the maximum in the volcano, the net rate is a competition between fast adsorption (being helped by stronger bonds to the surface) and fast surface reaction/desorption (being helped by weaker bonds to the surface)."

2. The volcano curves derived from the BEP relations are broad, typically with a width around 1 eV. This is because the net rate is a balance between rapid adsorption, aided by stronger bonds to the surface, and rapid surface reactions/desorption, facilitated by weaker bonds to the surface. This balance occurs around the peak of the volcano curve.

2. 从BEP关系产生的火山曲线是宽泛的，通常宽度约为1 eV。这是因为净速率是快速吸附（由表面更强的键助益）和快速表面反应/脱附（由表面较弱的键助益）之间的平衡。这种平衡发生在火山曲线的峰点周围。

[1] "For reactions where selectivity plays a role, the considerations above cannot be used. While Pt has the largest turnover for NO hydrogenation, Rh has a much larger selectivity for N2 formation [37], which makes Rh a more interesting catalyst."

3. For reactions requiring selectivity, the above considerations do not apply. Although Pt has the highest turnover rate for NO hydrogenation, Rh exhibits significantly greater N2 formation selectivity [37], making Rh a more promising catalyst.

3. 对于需要选择性的反应，上述考虑不适用。虽然Pt在NO氢化中的周转率最高，但Rh在N2形成的高选择性 [37]，使得Rh成为更有趣的催化剂。

[1] "The inclusion of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions at higher coverage may simply move the appropriate point along the BEP line [8,43]. The reason is that the transition state and the final state in dissociation are quite alike (this is the reason for the linear relation in the first place) [8], and the two states are therefore affected by high coverage in a similar manner."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
5. Incorporating adsorbate-adsorbate interactions at increased coverage levels might merely shift the relevant point along the BEP line [8,43]. This occurs because the transition state and the end state in dissociation are remarkably similar (which is why the initial linear relationship exists) [8], and both states respond to high coverage in a comparable fashion.
</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>
5. 引入较高覆盖度下的吸附剂-吸附剂相互作用可能只是沿着BEP线移动相关点 [8,43]。这是因为分解过程中的过渡态和最终状态非常相似（这就是最初存在线性关系的原因）[8]，这两个状态因此以类似的方式响应高覆盖度。
