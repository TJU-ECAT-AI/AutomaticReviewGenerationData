[1] "We have shown that if this relation is used in the kinetics, it turns out that in most cases the optimal adsorption energy (giving the largest catalytic activity) is in the range from 1 to 2 eV."

[3] "It was recently established that for dissociative chemisorption of a number of molecules the activation energy depends linearly on the reaction energy1 [811]."
[4] "The basic premises throughout the present work is that Ea and E1 are linearly related (Fig. 1),(5) Ea = α1E1 + β1,and we shall use the values α1 = 0.87 and β1 = 1.34 eV as determined in Ref. [8] but the precise values of these constants are not important in the context presented here."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies allow for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which then facilitates the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate a more facile formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

The relevance of ΔEv to catalytic activity and oxidizing ability stems from its impact on the surface chemistry of the oxide. A lower ΔEv allows for easier adsorption of oxygen molecules, which is essential for the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism to proceed efficiently. This, in turn, enhances the overall catalytic performance of the oxide catalyst. The linear relationship between the activation energy for dissociation (Ea) and the dissociative chemisorption energy (E1) also indicates that the energy required for the key steps in the reaction can be precisely controlled, further optimizing the catalytic process.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位进行操作。氧空位允许氧分子的吸附，进而促进氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

ΔEv与催化活性和氧化能力的相关性源于它对氧化物表面化学的影响。较低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更易于形成，从而增强催化性能和氧化能力。这种线性关系表明，反应的关键步骤所需的活化能（Ea）与解离化吸附能（E1）之间存在精确控制，进一步优化催化过程。
