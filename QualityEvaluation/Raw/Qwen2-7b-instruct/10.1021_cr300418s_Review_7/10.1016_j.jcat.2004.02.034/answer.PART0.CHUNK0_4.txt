The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values lead to increased activity and oxidizing power, as they facilitate the formation of reactive oxygen species that are crucial for the oxidation process. Therefore, optimizing ΔEv is essential for enhancing the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation reactions.
