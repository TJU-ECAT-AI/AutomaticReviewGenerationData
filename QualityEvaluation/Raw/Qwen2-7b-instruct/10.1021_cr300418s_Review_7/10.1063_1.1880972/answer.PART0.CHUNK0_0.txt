[1] "In oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the sequential addition of an oxygen atom to the surface of the catalyst, forming an oxygen vacancy."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv leads to lower catalytic activity but higher oxidizing power."
[3] "This is because a higher ΔEv means that more energy is needed to create an oxygen vacancy, which in turn makes the surface less available for reaction, thus reducing catalytic activity. However, it also implies that the surface is better at oxidizing substances due to the higher energy barrier for adsorption and reaction."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the stepwise addition of an oxygen atom to the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for this process (ΔEv) plays a critical role in both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv results in reduced catalytic activity due to the increased energy needed to create an oxygen vacancy, which makes the surface less accessible for reactions. Conversely, this higher energy barrier enhances the surface's oxidizing power by facilitating the adsorption and reaction of substances more effectively.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及表面逐次添加氧原子，形成氧空位的过程。形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较高的ΔEv导致催化活性降低，因为形成氧空位需要更多的能量，使得表面更难以参与反应。然而，这同时也意味着表面具有更高的氧化能力，因为较高的能量壁垒有利于吸附和反应物质的有效进行。
