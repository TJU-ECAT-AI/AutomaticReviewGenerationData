[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps involving the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface, followed by the formation of an oxygen vacancy."

[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface, leading to the formation of an oxygen vacancy. The energy required for this formation, denoted as ΔEv, significantly influences the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.
