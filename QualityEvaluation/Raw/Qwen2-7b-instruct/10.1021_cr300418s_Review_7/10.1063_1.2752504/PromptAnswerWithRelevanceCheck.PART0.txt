</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically leads to lower catalytic activity and oxidizing power because it hinders the mobility of reactant molecules, thus reducing the efficiency of the reaction.
