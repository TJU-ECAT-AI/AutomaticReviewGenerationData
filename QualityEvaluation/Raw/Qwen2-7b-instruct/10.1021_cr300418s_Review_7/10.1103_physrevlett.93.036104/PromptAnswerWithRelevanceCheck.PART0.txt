[1] "Titanium dioxide is a promising photocatalyst for the remediation of pollutants and the photoelectrochemical conversion of solar energy [1]."
[2] "These and a wide variety of other attractive applications have stimulated a concerted effort to investigate the atomic-scale properties of TiO2 [25]."
[3] "For certain photo-catalytic oxidation reactions, the f011g facets of polycrystalline rutile TiO2 samples are particularly active, and it has been speculated that a special atomic configuration on TiO2011 alters either the efficiency with which photo-generated carriers are trapped at the surface or the rate at which they are transferred at the solid-liquid interface [7]."
[4] "In the attempt to find a structural model capable to explain the experimental observations, we performed density functional theory calculations within the Car-Parrinello approach [13,14], using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof [15] exchange-correlation functional and ultrasoft pseudopotentials [16], together with a plane-wave expansion of the Kohn-Sham orbitals."
[5] "The coordination of surface atoms is a decisive factor in the surface chemistry of metal oxides [9,10]."
[6] "Virtually all stable 1  1 terminated TiO2 surfaces contain two-fold coordinated O atoms and fivefold coordinated Ti atoms [2]."
[7] "Interestingly, the TiO2011-2  1 surface investigated here is fully oxidized under typical preparation conditions."
[8] "The main characteristic is the presence of one-fold coordinated oxygen atoms, O(1), with corresponding TiO1 bond distances of 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 binding energy / eV intensity / a.u."
[9] "Comparison of this theoretical result with experiment is not straightforward due to the strong dependence of the photoemission spectra on the photon energy h."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The formation of an oxygen vacancy requires energy (ΔEv). This energy barrier affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv leads to a reduced ability of the surface to form oxygen vacancies, which can hinder the reaction by decreasing the availability of oxygen for the oxidation process. Conversely, a lower ΔEv facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the surface's capacity to participate in the oxidation reactions, thereby increasing both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the surface.

In summary, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining the efficiency of oxide surfaces in catalyzing oxidation reactions. Lower ΔEv values lead to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing ability, while higher ΔEv values result in decreased activity and oxidizing capability.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位（Ov）来运作。形成氧空位需要能量（ΔEv）。这种能量壁垒影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv意味着表面形成氧空位的能力降低，这可以阻碍反应，减少表面可用的氧进行氧化过程。相反，较低的ΔEv有利于形成氧空位，增强表面参与氧化反应的能力，从而提高表面的催化活性和氧化能力。

简而言之，氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面催化氧化反应的效率方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv值导致活性和氧化能力的增加，而较高的ΔEv值则导致活性和氧化能力的降低。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the breaking of the O-O bond in oxygen molecules to facilitate the oxidation of organic compounds. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity of the surface, allowing for more efficient adsorption and oxidation of substrates. This mechanism suggests that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation influences the surface's ability to promote the oxidation of organic compounds, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance.

The researchers employed density functional theory calculations, utilizing the Car-Parrinello approach, Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional, ultrasoft pseudopotentials, and a plane-wave expansion of Kohn-Sham orbitals to explain the experimental findings. They found that the surface energy calculations necessitated the use of a thicker slab, adhering to the methodology outlined in Reference [18]. The comparison of the theoretical outcomes with experimental data was complicated by the strong dependence of the photoemission spectra on the photon energy \(h\). Supporting evidence for the proposed model was provided by several experimental observations. The computational analysis revealed that the states at the valence band's upper edge are localized at the surface O(1) atoms (refer to Figure 4).

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to increased catalytic activity and enhanced oxidizing ability. This is because oxygen vacancies create additional sites for the adsorption of reactants, promoting the reaction pathways and increasing the efficiency of the catalytic process. However, too low ΔEv might lead to rapid depletion of oxygen vacancies, affecting the long-term stability and performance of the catalyst.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is high, it signifies that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation is substantial, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the increased stability of the oxide surface. Conversely, a lower ΔEv may result in a less stable surface, potentially reducing the catalyst's effectiveness in the reaction.
