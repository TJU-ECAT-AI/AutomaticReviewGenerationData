[1] "Titanium dioxide is a promising photocatalyst for the remediation of pollutants and the photoelectrochemical conversion of solar energy."
[2] "For certain photo- catalytic oxidation reactions, the f011g facets of polycrys- talline rutile TiO2 samples are particularly active."
[3] "We present work that is motivated by the growing evidence of a dramatic face dependence in the photocatalytic activity of TiO2."
[4] "We suggest that these species play a special role in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2011 surface."
[5] "The coordination of surface atoms is a decisive factor in the surface chemistry of metal oxides."
[6] "In bulk TiO2 the titanium atoms are surrounded by octahedra of six oxygen atoms."
[7] "Such undercoordinated Ti(5) atoms are preferred adsorption sites for a variety of molecules."
[8] "The specific details on the arrangement and coordination of surface atoms is not known."
[9] "All resulting structures were found to have surface energies larger than the relaxed unrecon- structed slab, with the single exception of the model shown in Fig. 1."
[10] "Comparison of this theoretical result with experiment is not straightforward due to the strong dependence of the photoemission spectra on the photon energy h."
[11] "It is, however, remarkable that a pronounced shoulder at the upper edge of the O2p band is seen for the TiO2011-2  1 surface but not for the TiO2110 one at h  26 eV."
[12] "The observation that TiO2011-2  1 is hard to reduce (Fig. 3) is also in-line with the proposed model."
[13] "Our calculations indicate that the states at the upper edge of the valence band are localized at the surface O(1) atoms."
[14] "Therefore these atoms should be able to efficiently trap the photogenerated holes and readily oxidize acceptor species present on the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the breaking of the O-O bond in oxygen molecules to facilitate the oxidation of organic compounds. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher reactivity of the surface, allowing for more efficient adsorption and oxidation of substrates. This mechanism suggests that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation influences the surface's ability to promote the oxidation of organic compounds, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧分子断裂时释放的能量来促进有机化合物的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明表面的反应性较高，能够更有效地吸附和氧化基质。这一机制表明，氧空位形成能垒影响表面促进有机化合物氧化的能力，从而影响整体催化性能。
