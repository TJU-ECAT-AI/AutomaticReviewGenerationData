[1] "Our results provide evidence that the surface structure is described by a model that includes one-fold coordinated (titanyl) oxygen atoms giving rise to double bonded Ti O species."
[2] "These species should play a special role in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2011 surface."
[3] "The coordination of surface atoms is a decisive factor in the surface chemistry of metal oxides."
[4] "In the attempt to find a structural model capable to explain the experimental observations, we performed density functional theory calculations within the Car-Parrinello approach."
[5] "The 2 1 structure in Fig. 1 is perfectly stoichiometric and its main characteristic is the presence of one-fold coordinated oxygen atoms, O(1), with corresponding TiO1 bond distances of 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 binding energy / eV intensity / a.u."
[6] "Such bond-lengths are 0.3 A shorter than typical TiO bonds, and essentially correspond to TiO double bonds (denoted Ti O in the following)."
[7] "Adsorbate-induced features are clearly located between the rows, in agreement with the position of the Ti(5) sites in the model."
[8] "Our calculations indicate that the states at the upper edge of the valence band are localized at the surface O(1) atoms."
[9] "Therefore these atoms should be able to efficiently trap the photogenerated holes and readily oxidize acceptor species present on the surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is high, it signifies that the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation is substantial, which can lead to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidizing ability due to the increased stability of the oxide surface. Conversely, a lower ΔEv may result in a less stable surface, potentially reducing the catalyst's effectiveness in the reaction.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位（ΔEv）的形成释放的能量来驱动反应。氧空位形成的能量要求对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。当ΔEv高时，表明氧空位形成的能量壁垒较大，这可能导致增强的催化活性和氧化能力，因为氧化物表面的稳定性增加。相反，较低的ΔEv可能导致表面稳定性降低，这可能减少催化剂在反应中的有效性。
