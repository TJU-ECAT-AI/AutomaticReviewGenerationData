The researchers employed density functional theory calculations, utilizing the Car-Parrinello approach, Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange-correlation functional, ultrasoft pseudopotentials, and a plane-wave expansion of Kohn-Sham orbitals to explain the experimental findings. They found that the surface energy calculations necessitated the use of a thicker slab, adhering to the methodology outlined in Reference [18]. The comparison of the theoretical outcomes with experimental data was complicated by the strong dependence of the photoemission spectra on the photon energy \(h\). Supporting evidence for the proposed model was provided by several experimental observations. The computational analysis revealed that the states at the valence band's upper edge are localized at the surface O(1) atoms (refer to Figure 4).

研究人员使用密度泛函理论计算，采用Car-Parrinello方法，Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof交换相关功能，超软赝势，以及Kohn-Sham轨道的平面波展开来解释实验结果。他们发现为了进行表面能计算，需要使用更厚的层，并遵循参考文献[18]中描述的方法。理论结果与实验数据之间的比较由于光子能量\(h\)对光谱发射强度的强烈依赖性而变得复杂。支持提出模型的证据来自于几个实验观察。计算分析表明，价带顶部边缘的状态位于表面O(1)原子上（参见图4）。
