[1] "Titanium dioxide is a promising photocatalyst for the remediation of pollutants and the photoelectrochemical conversion of solar energy."
[2] "These and a wide variety of other attractive applications have stimulated a concerted effort to investigate the atomic-scale properties of TiO2."
[3] "For certain photo-catalytic oxidation reactions, the f011g facets of polycrys- talline rutile TiO2 samples are particularly active, and it has been speculated that a special atomic configuration on TiO2011 alters either the efficiency with which photo-generated carriers are trapped at the surface or the rate at which they are transferred at the solid-liquid interface."
[4] "Our results provide evidence that the surface structure is described by a model that includes one-fold coordinated (titanyl) oxygen atoms giving rise to double bonded Ti O species."
[5] "These species should play a special role in the enhanced photocatalytic activity of the TiO2011 surface."
[6] "In the attempt to find a structural model capable to explain the experimental observations, we performed density functional theory calculations."
[7] "The most relevant difference between the two calculated curves is at the upper edge of the O2p valence band, where a well-defined peak is present for the 011 surface, originating from the O1 titanyl atoms."
[8] "As a matter of fact, our calculations indicate that the states at the upper edge of the valence band are localized at the surface O(1) atoms."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (Ov) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to increased catalytic activity and enhanced oxidizing ability. This is because oxygen vacancies create additional sites for the adsorption of reactants, promoting the reaction pathways and increasing the efficiency of the catalytic process. However, too low ΔEv might lead to rapid depletion of oxygen vacancies, affecting the long-term stability and performance of the catalyst.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧空位（Ov）的形成来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有决定性作用。较低的ΔEv使得氧空位更容易形成，从而提高催化活性并增强氧化能力。这是因为氧空位提供了额外的吸附反应物的位点，促进反应途径并增加催化剂的效率。然而，ΔEv过低可能会导致氧空位迅速耗尽，影响催化剂的长期稳定性和性能。
