[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "Chapters 6 and 7 are appropriately paired, the first dealing with electronic properties and the second with magnetic and optical properties."
[3] "Chapter 6 is the longest of the contributions, providing a very nice overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides."
[4] "This contribution rapidly launches into second quantization approaches that will surely lose many readers, especially those whose primary interest is tied to catalysis."
[5] "Chapters 811 survey redox and acidbase properties of a variety of catalyst systems, including zeolites."
[6] "Chapters 1315 cover alkane reactions on metal oxides, specifically propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, and are followed by a chapter, coauthored by the editor, on olefin metathesis."
[7] "Chapter 17 and 18 target total combustion of volatile organic compounds and hydrogenation reactions, respectively."
[8] "Photocatalysis for splitting water is covered in Chapters 19 and 20 for TiO2-based systems and RuO2-promoted p-block (d10) metal oxides, respectively."
[9] "Chapter 21 covers selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons for selective reduction on metal oxides."

Metal oxide chemistry and applications are covered in this volume through 23 chapters, with a focus on catalytic chemistry and transition-metal oxides in 15 of them. Chapter 6 offers an extensive overview of the electronic structure of metal oxides. However, the introduction of second quantization approaches in Chapter 7 may confuse readers primarily interested in catalysis. The redox and acid-base properties of catalyst systems, including zeolites, are surveyed in Chapters 8-11. Alkane reactions on metal oxides, such as propane selective oxidation, methane oxidation, and oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, are discussed in Chapters 13-15, which are complemented by a chapter on olefin metathesis. Chapters 17 and 18 address total combustion of volatile organic compounds and hydrogenation reactions. Photocatalysis for water splitting is explored in Chapters 19 and 20, utilizing TiO2-based systems and RuO2-promoted p-block (d10) metal oxides, respectively. Selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement using ammonia or hydrocarbons is covered in Chapter 21. Lastly, the volume concludes with an overview of solid oxide fuel cell anode materials.
