[1] "Several of the chapters in this collection do provide excellent coverage of basic topics in the chemistry and applications of metal oxides, but they are few in number and the logic of their organization is vague, apart from the fact that the more fundamental topics are found early in the volume."
[2] "The opening paragraph of the preface suggests that this volume was intended to be a comprehensive survey that should serve as both an introductory source and a reference on metal oxides."
[3] "While the content should be of significant interest to anyone seeking introductory and reference material on catalytic transition-metal oxides, it is less likely to appeal to those seeking general coverage of metal oxides."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between oxygen vacancies and reactant molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates higher reactivity, as it requires less activation energy for the formation of oxygen vacancies, which are essential for the mechanism to proceed. This makes the surface more effective in promoting the reaction, leading to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧空位和反应分子之间的电子转移而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。ΔEv较低表明反应性较高，因为形成氧空位所需的激活能较少。这使得表面更有效于促进反应，从而提高了催化活性和氧化能力。
