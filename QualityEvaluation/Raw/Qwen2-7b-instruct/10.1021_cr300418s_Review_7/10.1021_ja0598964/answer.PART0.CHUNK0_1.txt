Metal oxide catalysts play a crucial role in various chemical processes. For instance, they are involved in redox and acid-base reactions, such as alkane oxidation and propane selective oxidation. Additionally, they are used in total combustion of volatile organic compounds and hydrogenation reactions. Photocatalysis for water splitting also benefits from metal oxide catalysts, specifically those based on TiO2 and RuO2-promoted p-block (d10) metal oxides. Metal oxides further facilitate selective catalytic reduction for NOx abatement and serve as semiconducting SnO2 gas sensors.
