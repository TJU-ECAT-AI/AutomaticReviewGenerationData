[1] "Our study of Au and Au2 binding to TiO2 focuses on finding the binding sites, on elucidating the role of oxygen vacancies, and on determining the nature of the AuTi bond."

[2] "Whenever an oxygen vacancy is available, Au and Au2 bind most strongly to the vacancy site; Au, which is a rather electronegative atom, prefers to take the place of the missing oxygen."

[3] "The reduction of the rutile surface, by removal of bridging oxygen atoms, causes a charge redistribution in the system, which extends far from the vacancy site."

[4] "The binding of Au to the reduced TiO2 surface involves a substantial charge transfer to gold. We argue that this will affect the chemistry in which Au will engage."

[5] "The energy to make an O2 molecule and a completely reduced surface: We have calculated the energy DE35(Ev 1EO22Es)/2, which is the energy to form a surface with 1.0 ML of vacancies..."

[6] "The removal of an O atom, to form a vacancy, leaves behind some electron density that was tied up to form the O2d ion at the surface."

[7] "The nature of bonding between Au and the stoichiometric TiO2 surface, we examine the shifts in electron density when this bond is formed."

[8] "The binding of Au to the reduced surface, on or near the site of reduction, is due to electron transfer. This is why the binding to the bridging site is far stronger than that of Au to the stoichiometric surface."

[9] "We have seen that the HOMO of the reduced surface is delocalized and penetrates deeply into the slab."

[10] "Clearly, the distribution of nearby vacancies has a large effect on the ability of a given vacant site to bind Au."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface as active sites for oxygen adsorption and subsequent reaction with reactants. Oxygen vacancies, which are created by the removal of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface, play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining the surface's ability to catalyze reactions efficiently. This energy reflects the stability of the oxygen vacancy state and influences the reactivity of the surface towards adsorbates.

In the context of the document, the energy ΔEv is related to the energy required to form an oxygen vacancy and an oxygen molecule on the surface. This energy is calculated by considering the energy of removing an oxygen atom from the surface and the energy of forming an oxygen molecule. The document also discusses how the presence of oxygen vacancies redistributes charges in the system, affecting the binding of metals like gold. The nature of bonding between gold and the oxide surface, particularly at oxygen vacancy sites, involves significant electron transfer, which is essential for the catalytic activity. The delocalization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) in reduced oxide surfaces contributes to the enhanced binding strength of metals to these sites, especially those with higher electronegativity. The distribution of nearby vacancies also influences the binding affinity of metals, suggesting that the local environment of vacancies on the surface plays a critical role in determining the catalytic behavior of the oxide surface.

火星-克雷弗伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面上的氧空位作为活性位点来吸附氧气并随后与反应物反应来运作。氧空位是由从氧化物表面上移除氧原子而产生的，它们对表面的催化活性和氧化能力有重要影响。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了表面催化反应效率的关键因素。这一能量反映了氧空位状态的稳定性，并影响表面对于吸附剂的反应性。

根据文档中的内容，ΔEv与表面形成一个氧空位和一个氧分子所需的能量有关。这涉及到从表面上移除一个氧原子以及形成一个氧分子的能量。文档还讨论了氧空位的存在如何在系统中重新分配电荷，影响金属如金等在表面上的结合。金与氧化物表面之间的结合性质，特别是在氧空位位置上，涉及显著的电子转移，这对于催化剂活性至关重要。氧化物表面中最高占据分子轨道（HOMO）的局域化有助于增强金属对该位点的结合强度，特别是对于具有更高电负性的金属而言。附近氧空位的分布也影响金属的结合亲和力，表明表面附近氧空位的局部环境对氧化物表面的催化行为起着关键作用。
