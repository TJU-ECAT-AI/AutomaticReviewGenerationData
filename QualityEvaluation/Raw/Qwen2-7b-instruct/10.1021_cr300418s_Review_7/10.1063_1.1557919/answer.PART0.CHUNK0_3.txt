The removal of an O atom, to form a vacancy, leaves behind some electron density that was tied up to form the O22 ion at the surface. This excess electron density could be donated to an adsorbed metal cluster or to a single atom! during bond formation.

One would therefore infer that the enhanced binding of Au to the reduced surface, on or near the site of reduction, is due to this electron transfer. Here Au acts somewhat like the O that was removed, although more weakly; it accepts some, but not all, electron density that the O left behind. This is why the binding to the bridging site is far stronger than that of Au to the stoichiometric surface.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the electron density that is released when an oxygen atom is removed to form an oxygen vacancy. This electron density can then be donated to an adsorbed metal cluster, enhancing the binding of the metal to the surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more easily able to form oxygen vacancies, which in turn facilitates the electron density transfer and enhances the binding of metal catalysts. This process is essential for the effectiveness of oxide surfaces in catalyzing oxidation reactions.

火星-范克列文机制通过利用形成氧空位时释放出的电子密度来运行。这个电子密度可以被吸附在表面的金属簇所接受，从而增强金属对表面的吸附力。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。ΔEv较低表明表面更容易形成氧空位，这反过来促进了电子密度的转移并增强了金属催化剂的吸附力。这一过程对于氧化物表面有效催化氧化反应至关重要。
