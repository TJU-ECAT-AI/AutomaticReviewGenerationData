[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. These vacancies act as active sites for the adsorption of reactants and the subsequent formation of reactive intermediates."

[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more favorable condition for the formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to higher catalytic activity and increased oxidizing ability."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions relies on the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst's surface. These vacancies serve as active sites for adsorbing reactants and generating reactive intermediates. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is vital in assessing both the catalyst's activity and its oxidizing capacity. A lower ΔEv signifies a more conducive environment for oxygen vacancy formation, resulting in heightened catalytic performance and enhanced oxidizing capability.
