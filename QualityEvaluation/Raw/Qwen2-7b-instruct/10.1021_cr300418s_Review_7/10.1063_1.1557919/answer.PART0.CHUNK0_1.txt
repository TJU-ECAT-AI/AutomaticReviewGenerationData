[1] "The energetics of Au on TiO2 110! have been indirectly measured by Campbell et al. In one experiment,27 they measured coarsening as a function of temperature. Using a kinetic model to fit the data, they found the monomer adsorption energy, less the diffusion barrier, to be 0.43 eV. In another study, of island growth at different temperatures,25 one model consistent with the data had a monomer diffusion barrier of 0.07 eV. This value should be considered only a suggestion, since the barrier was not measured directly, and the true kinetics are unknown. Both experiments used nearly stoichiometric TiO2 surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The ΔEv energy determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen vacancy formation, which can facilitate the reaction by providing active sites for the oxidation process. The specific value of ΔEv can significantly influence the efficiency and selectivity of the oxidation reactions, thereby impacting the overall catalytic performance of the oxide surface.

火星-克雷威尔机制通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动氧化物催化氧化反应。ΔEv能量决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明有更高的倾向形成氧空位，这可以促进反应过程，提供氧化过程中的活性位点。特定的ΔEv值可以显著影响氧化反应的效率和选择性，从而影响氧化物表面的整体催化性能。
