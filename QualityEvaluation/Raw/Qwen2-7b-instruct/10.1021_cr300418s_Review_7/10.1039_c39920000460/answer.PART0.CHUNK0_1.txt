In the presence of rhodium, the H2-Ce02 interaction is to a large extent reversible, simple evacuation of the reduced sample has been demonstrated to promote reoxidation of the support; this explains some puzzling effects of the reduction/evacuation treatments on the actual oxidation state of ceria in Rh-CeO2 catalysts.

Many important questions remain unanswered as yet. In particular, the role played by highly dispersed metals has not been extensively investigated.

The catalyst, with 2.9% metal loading by m a s , was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation from an aqueous solution of Rh(N03)3. After the impregnation step, it was dried in air, at 383 K, for 10 h, and then stored until it was reduced in situ with hydrogen, at 623 K, for 1 h. 

A precursor/support sample, the mass of which was 128.5 mg, was submitted to the successive series of treatments indicated in Table 1.

Upon analysing these two series of spectra, more specifically the variation throughout them of the relative intensity of the so-called v' peak, considered to be as a characteristic feature of Ce"1 ions,

For ceria only, irreversible reduction of the oxide, leading to the elimination of H2O, and therefore to the creation of oxygen vacancies, takes place to a much larger extent.

The results presented here suggest that the actual state of ceria submitted to a reduction treatment with hydrogen depends critically on the presence of the metal.

Rh(3d) XPS spectra, on the other hand, show that the three reduction treatments lead to Rho. This, in principle, puzzling result can reasonably be interpreted as owing to reoxidation of ceria occurring during the evacuation following the hydrogen treatment of Rh-Ce02 samples.

The opposite is true for higher reduction temperatures.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the surface of the oxide as an active site for the reaction. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in this mechanism, as they facilitate the adsorption of reactants and the subsequent transfer of electrons for the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more energetically favorable process, potentially enhancing the efficiency of the reaction. However, the document does not provide specific details on how the mechanism operates or the exact value of ΔEv for the oxide surface discussed.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化的氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面作为反应活性位点来运行。氧空位在这一机制中扮演着关键角色，它们有助于吸附反应物并随后转移电子进行氧化过程。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）显著影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明过程更易于发生，可能提高反应的效率。然而，文档没有提供机制的具体运作方式或讨论的氧化物表面的ΔEv的确切值。
