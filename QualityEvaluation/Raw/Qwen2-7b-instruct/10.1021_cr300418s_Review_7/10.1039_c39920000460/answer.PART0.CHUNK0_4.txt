4. "For ceria only, irreversible reduction of the oxide, leading to the elimination of H2O, and therefore to the creation of oxygen vacancies, takes place to a much larger extent."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons from the surface of the oxide to the reactants, enabling the formation of active sites for oxidation. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates a greater stability of the oxide surface, which can enhance the catalytic activity by providing more active sites for reaction. However, the exact value of ΔEv affects the balance between the stability of the oxide surface and its reactivity, influencing the efficiency of the catalytic process.

火星-范克列伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面向反应物转移电子，从而形成氧化活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。较高的ΔEv通常意味着氧化物表面的稳定性更高，这可以通过提供更多的活性位点来增强催化活性。然而，具体值的ΔEv影响氧化物表面的稳定性和反应性之间的平衡，从而影响催化过程的效率。
