"In the presence of rhodium, the H2-Ce02 interaction is to a large extent reversible, simple evacuation of the reduced sample has been demonstrated to promote reoxidation of the support; this explains some puzzling effects of the reduction/evacuation treatments on the actual oxidation state of ceria in Rh-CeOz catalysts."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the reaction's catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power. The reversibility of the interaction between hydrogen and ceria in the presence of rhodium, as demonstrated by the observed effects of reduction and subsequent evacuation, is a manifestation of this mechanism.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及表面氧化物催化剂上的氧空位的形成和迁移来运作。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv值使得更容易形成氧空位，从而增强反应的催化效率和氧化能力。氢与氧化铈之间的相互作用的可逆性，在有铑存在的情况下被证明，是这一机制的一个表现，这是通过观察还原和随后抽真空后所观察到的效果体现出来的。
