4. "For ceria only, irreversible reduction of the oxide, leading to the elimination of H2O, and therefore to the creation of oxygen vacancies, takes place to a much larger extent."
5. "Upon analysing these two series of spectra, more specifically the variation throughout them of the relative intensity of the so-called v' peak, considered to be as a characteristic feature of Ce"1 ions, some conclusions can be drawn."
6. "Also worth of noting is that after reduction at 473 K, the rhodium containing sample becomes more deeply reduced than the bare support."
7. "Obviously, this obliged us to be cautious in assigning the hydrogen forms desorbed in the low temperature region, i.e. 295-473 K, to species chemisorbed on the metal, or even to the so-called reversible forms."

1. Irreversible reduction of the oxide in ceria leads to the elimination of H2O and creates oxygen vacancies, which happens to a much larger extent compared to ceria alone.
2. The variation of the relative intensity of the v' peak in Ce(3d) XPS spectra helps draw conclusions about the nature of Ce ions.
3. Reduction at 473 K makes the rhodium-containing sample more deeply reduced than the bare support.
4. We need to be cautious when attributing hydrogen forms desorbed in the low temperature region to metal-bound species or reversible forms due to potential interactions with the support.

1. 在氧化铈中，不可逆的氧化导致水的消除和氧空位的形成，这种现象在氧化铈中的发生程度远大于单独的氧化铈。
2. Ce(3d) XPS谱图中v'峰相对强度的变化有助于我们得出关于Ce离子性质的结论。
3. 在473 K下进行的还原使含铑样品的还原程度比裸支持更深。
4. 我们需要谨慎地将低温度区域（295-473 K）脱附的氢形式归因于金属结合物种或可逆形式，因为这可能与支撑体有相互作用。
