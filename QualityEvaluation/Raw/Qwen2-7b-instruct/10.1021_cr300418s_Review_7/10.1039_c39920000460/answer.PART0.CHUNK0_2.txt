In the presence of rhodium, the H2-Ce02 interaction is to a large extent reversible, simple evacuation of the reduced sample has been demonstrated to promote reoxidation of the support; this explains some puzzling effects of the reduction/evacuation treatments on the actual oxidation state of ceria in Rh-CeOz catalysts.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which are energetically favorable states. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates greater stability of the oxygen vacancy, which can affect the rate of reaction and the selectivity of the product.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及在氧化物表面形成氧空位来运作。氧空位的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较高的ΔEv通常表明氧空位的稳定性更高，这可能会影响反应速率和产物的选择性。
