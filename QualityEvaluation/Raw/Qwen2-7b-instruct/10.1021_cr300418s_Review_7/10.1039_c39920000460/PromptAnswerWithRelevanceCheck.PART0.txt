4. "For ceria only, irreversible reduction of the oxide, leading to the elimination of H2O, and therefore to the creation of oxygen vacancies, takes place to a much larger extent."
5. "Upon analysing these two series of spectra, more specifically the variation throughout them of the relative intensity of the so-called v' peak, considered to be as a characteristic feature of Ce"1 ions, some conclusions can be drawn."
6. "Also worth of noting is that after reduction at 473 K, the rhodium containing sample becomes more deeply reduced than the bare support."
7. "Obviously, this obliged us to be cautious in assigning the hydrogen forms desorbed in the low temperature region, i.e. 295-473 K, to species chemisorbed on the metal, or even to the so-called reversible forms."

1. Irreversible reduction of the oxide in ceria leads to the elimination of H2O and creates oxygen vacancies, which happens to a much larger extent compared to ceria alone.
2. The variation of the relative intensity of the v' peak in Ce(3d) XPS spectra helps draw conclusions about the nature of Ce ions.
3. Reduction at 473 K makes the rhodium-containing sample more deeply reduced than the bare support.
4. We need to be cautious when attributing hydrogen forms desorbed in the low temperature region to metal-bound species or reversible forms due to potential interactions with the support.

1. 在氧化铈中，不可逆的氧化导致水的消除和氧空位的形成，这种现象在氧化铈中的发生程度远大于单独的氧化铈。
2. Ce(3d) XPS谱图中v'峰相对强度的变化有助于我们得出关于Ce离子性质的结论。
3. 在473 K下进行的还原使含铑样品的还原程度比裸支持更深。
4. 我们需要谨慎地将低温度区域（295-473 K）脱附的氢形式归因于金属结合物种或可逆形式，因为这可能与支撑体有相互作用。

In the presence of rhodium, the H2-Ce02 interaction is to a large extent reversible, simple evacuation of the reduced sample has been demonstrated to promote reoxidation of the support; this explains some puzzling effects of the reduction/evacuation treatments on the actual oxidation state of ceria in Rh-CeO2 catalysts.

Many important questions remain unanswered as yet. In particular, the role played by highly dispersed metals has not been extensively investigated.

The catalyst, with 2.9% metal loading by m a s , was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation from an aqueous solution of Rh(N03)3. After the impregnation step, it was dried in air, at 383 K, for 10 h, and then stored until it was reduced in situ with hydrogen, at 623 K, for 1 h. 

A precursor/support sample, the mass of which was 128.5 mg, was submitted to the successive series of treatments indicated in Table 1.

Upon analysing these two series of spectra, more specifically the variation throughout them of the relative intensity of the so-called v' peak, considered to be as a characteristic feature of Ce"1 ions,

For ceria only, irreversible reduction of the oxide, leading to the elimination of H2O, and therefore to the creation of oxygen vacancies, takes place to a much larger extent.

The results presented here suggest that the actual state of ceria submitted to a reduction treatment with hydrogen depends critically on the presence of the metal.

Rh(3d) XPS spectra, on the other hand, show that the three reduction treatments lead to Rho. This, in principle, puzzling result can reasonably be interpreted as owing to reoxidation of ceria occurring during the evacuation following the hydrogen treatment of Rh-Ce02 samples.

The opposite is true for higher reduction temperatures.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the surface of the oxide as an active site for the reaction. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in this mechanism, as they facilitate the adsorption of reactants and the subsequent transfer of electrons for the oxidation process. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more energetically favorable process, potentially enhancing the efficiency of the reaction. However, the document does not provide specific details on how the mechanism operates or the exact value of ΔEv for the oxide surface discussed.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which are energetically favorable states. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv typically indicates greater stability of the oxygen vacancy, which can affect the rate of reaction and the selectivity of the product.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values facilitate easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the reaction's catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power. The reversibility of the interaction between hydrogen and ceria in the presence of rhodium, as demonstrated by the observed effects of reduction and subsequent evacuation, is a manifestation of this mechanism.
