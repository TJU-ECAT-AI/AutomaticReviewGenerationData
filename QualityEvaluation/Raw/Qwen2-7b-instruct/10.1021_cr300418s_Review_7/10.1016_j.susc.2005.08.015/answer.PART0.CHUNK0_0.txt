[1] "The DFT + U formalism has been used to study oxygen vacancy defects in the (111), (110) and (100) surfaces of ceria, in order that a consistent approach to describe the electronic structure of both pure (CeO2; Ce4+) and defective (CeO2x; Ce3+) ceria can be applied."
[2] "In the electronic density of states a new gap state appears between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the unoccupied Ce 4f states."
[3] "Localisation of charge due to the gap state and excess spin density on Ce3+ sites neighbouring the vacancy is observed for all three surfaces."
[4] "Thus, the (110) surface has the lowest vacancy formation energy."
[5] "The vacancy formation energies do not necessarily follow the stabilities of the pure surfaces."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released from the oxidation of a reactant to activate another reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface is more prone to forming oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate the activation of reactants by providing reactive sites.

2. The DFT + U formalism has been employed to study oxygen vacancy defects in ceria surfaces, specifically (111), (110), and (100) surfaces, to achieve a consistent method for describing the electronic structure of both pure and defective ceria surfaces. This approach enables the examination of the electronic structure and defect formation energies in a unified manner.

3. The electronic density of states reveals a new gap state that emerges between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the unoccupied Ce 4f states, indicating a localized state associated with oxygen vacancy defects.

4. For all three surfaces, the presence of the gap state leads to the localization of charge on the two Ce3+ ions neighboring the vacancy site, alongside an excess spin density. This localization is observed for the (111), (110), and (100) surfaces alike.

5. The (110) surface exhibits the lowest vacancy formation energy among the three surfaces considered. This suggests that the (110) surface is more favorable for the formation of oxygen vacancies compared to the (111) and (100) surfaces.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用反应物氧化释放的能量来激活另一个反应物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明表面更易于形成氧空位，这可以促进活性位点的激活，从而促进反应物的活化。

2. 对于（111）、（110）和（100）表面的铈氧化物中的氧缺陷进行了研究，使用了DFT + U方法，以实现对纯态和缺陷态铈氧化物电子结构的统一描述方法。这种方法允许对电子结构和缺陷形成能进行统一的研究。

3. 在电子密度态中，观察到一个新的能隙出现在价带顶部和未占据的铈4f状态底部之间，这表明与氧空位缺陷相关的局部态的存在。

4. 对于所有三种表面，由于新能隙的存在，发现两个Ce3+离子相邻的空位位置上存在电荷的局域化，同时还有过剩的自旋密度。这种局域化现象在（111）、（110）和（100）表面上都有所观察。

5. （110）表面显示出三种表面中最低的氧空位形成能。这表明（110）表面对于氧空位的形成比（111）和（100）表面更为有利。
