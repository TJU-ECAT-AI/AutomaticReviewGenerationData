[1] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."
[2] "In respect of this there have been recent studies of partially reduced bulk ceria from Fabris et al. [14] and the partially reduced (100) surface from Nolan et al. [15]."
[3] "In this paper we will present a comprehensive study of the geometry and electronic structure of oxygen vacancy defects in the low index (111),(110) and (100) surfaces of ceria."
[4] "The present work now allows us to obtain a consistent description of the energetics of adsorption of small molecules such as CO and NO2 onto ceria surfaces, where defective surfaces play a major role and also for the meaningful computation of the energetics of catalytic reactions involving ceria surfaces and conversion of these molecules."

1. Understanding the oxygen vacancies in ceria is crucial for its oxygen storage capacity. Recent studies have focused on the partially reduced bulk ceria and the partially reduced (100) surface. This paper aims to comprehensively analyze the geometry and electronic structure of oxygen vacancies in the (111), (110), and (100) surfaces of ceria. This work enables a consistent description of the energetics involved in the adsorption of small molecules like CO and NO2 onto ceria surfaces and catalytic reactions involving these surfaces.
