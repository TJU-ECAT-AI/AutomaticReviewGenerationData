[1] "Given their importance for the oxygen storage capacity of ceria, it is vital to have a comprehensive understanding of oxygen vacancies in this material."
[2] "The impact of this for the study of catalytic reactions on ceria surfaces is discussed."
[3] "For the calculation of the surface vacancy formation energy, we apply DFT + U to the systems which contain Cethese species need to be described by a consistent approachand GGA- DFT to the remaining species, i.e. O2, which are correctly described by GGA-DFT."
[4] "In the present work, we find instead that the vacancy formation energies of the low index surfaces do not follow the trend indicated by the stabilities of the pure surfaces."
