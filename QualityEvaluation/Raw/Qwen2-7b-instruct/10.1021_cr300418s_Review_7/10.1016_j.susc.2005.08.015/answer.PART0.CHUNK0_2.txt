[1] "In respect of this there have been recent studies of partially reduced bulk ceria from Fabris et al.
[14] and the partially reduced (100) surface from Nolan et al. [15]."
[2] "It was demonstrated that applying GGA-DFT to the defective (100) ceria surface produces an inconsistent description of the electronic structure, which is similar to that of Ref. [13]."
[3] "The DFT + U approach was applied to recover a proper description of the electronic structure [15]."
[4] "Furthermore the importance of self-consistent ionic relaxations within the DFT + U approach was demonstrated."
[5] "The present work now allows us to obtain a consistent description of the energetics of adsorption of small molecules such as CO and NO2 onto ceria surfaces, where defective surfaces play a major role and also for the meaningful computation of the energetics of catalytic reactions involving ceria surfaces and conversion of these molecules."
