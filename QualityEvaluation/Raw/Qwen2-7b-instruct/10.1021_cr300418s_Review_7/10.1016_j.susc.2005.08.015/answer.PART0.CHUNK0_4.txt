[1] "In the electronic density of states a new gap state appears between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the unoccupied Ce 4f states."
[2] "Localisation of charge due to the gap state and excess spin density on Ce3+ sites neighbouring the vacancy is observed for all three surfaces."
[3] "Thus, while the (111) surface is the most stable surface and has the largest vacancy formation energy, the vacancy formation energy is lowest on the (110) surface rather than on the least stable (100) surface, so that formation of surface vacancies is most favourable on the (110) surface."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction forward. The ΔEv signifies the energy barrier for the creation of an oxygen vacancy in the oxide surface. This energy is crucial as it determines the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, leading to enhanced catalytic activity and oxidation efficiency.

2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically, the (110) surface, despite being less stable, exhibits a lower ΔEv for oxygen vacancy formation compared to the (100) surface. This makes the (110) surface more favorable for the formation of surface vacancies, thereby enhancing its catalytic performance and oxidation capacity.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，火星-范克里夫机制通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来推进反应。ΔEv代表在氧化物表面创建氧空位的能量壁垒。这一能量对于确定催化剂活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更有可能形成氧空位，从而提高催化剂活性和氧化效率。

2. 氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。具体来说，尽管（110）表面稳定性较低，但其氧空位形成的ΔEv低于（100）表面。这使得（110）表面更适合形成表面空位，从而增强其催化性能和氧化能力。
