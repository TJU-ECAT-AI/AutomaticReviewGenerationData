[1] "The importance of these defects in a variety of surface reactions has been stressed by several experimental and theoretical studies."
[2] "Molecular oxygen is typically used to restore the stoichiometry of ion-sputtered or vacuum-reduced TiO2 surfaces, and has a strong influence on the electronic properties, the geometric structure, and the chemical reactivity of these surfaces."
[3] "Adsorption energies (Ea) for the molecular (M1,M2) and dissociated (D1) states, and energy barriers (E#) for M2M1 diffusion and M1(M2) D1 dissociations on defective TiO2 110! surface."
[4] "The most stable molecular configuration is M1, in which the adsorbed O2 sits at the vacancy site with its axis parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the bridging oxygen rows, and forms bonds with the two nearest Ti atoms."
[5] "The process of BO capture by an OA corresponds to a D1M2 transition for which a lower bound estimate of the barrier is the difference in energy between the initial (D1) and final (M2) states, D1,2;3.4 eV."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies are crucial for the adsorption of oxygen molecules and subsequent oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more easily formed oxygen vacancy, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more efficient oxygen adsorption and reaction pathways.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the surface's reactivity towards oxygen molecules. Lower ΔEv values facilitate faster oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the surface's ability to adsorb oxygen and participate in oxidation reactions. This increased reactivity contributes to higher catalytic efficiency and stronger oxidizing capability, as the surface is better equipped to engage in key reactions that lead to oxidation products.

1. 汤斯-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式通过在氧化物表面上形成氧缺陷。这些缺陷对于氧气分子的吸附和后续氧化反应至关重要。氧缺陷形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv值意味着更容易形成氧缺陷，可能导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为表面能够更有效地吸附氧气并参与氧化反应。这种增强的反应性有助于提高催化效率和更强的氧化能力，因为它使表面更适合参与关键反应以生成氧化产物。

2. ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力中的重要性在于它对表面与氧气分子反应性的影响。较低的ΔEv值加速了氧缺陷的形成，增强了表面吸附氧气并参与氧化反应的能力。这种增加的活性有助于提高催化效率和更强的氧化能力，因为表面能够更好地参与到生成氧化产物的关键反应中。
