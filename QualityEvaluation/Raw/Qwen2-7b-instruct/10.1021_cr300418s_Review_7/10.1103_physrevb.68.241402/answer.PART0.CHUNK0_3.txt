[1] "Using first-principles density-functional calculations we have studied the interactions of molecular oxygen with a partially reduced rutile TiO2 110! surface."
[2] "Based on all these results, we analyze the mechanism of a recently observed oxygen-mediated O vacancy diffusion process on TiO2(110)."
[3] "Our results, while supporting these observations,suggest a revised pathway where the oxygen adatoms still play a central role, as found in STM03, but are not as highly reactive as originally proposed."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as active sites for oxygen adsorption. These sites facilitate the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which subsequently enables the oxidation of substrates through the assistance of these oxygen atoms. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface can easily create oxygen vacancies, enhancing its catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Therefore, the ΔEv serves as an indicator of the surface's efficiency in facilitating the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为活性位点来吸附氧气分子。这些位点能够促进氧气分子的吸附，进而通过这些氧原子辅助实现对底物的氧化。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv表明表面可以容易地产生氧空位，从而增强其催化活性和氧化能力。因此，ΔEv可以作为衡量表面有效促进火星-克雷维尔机制的指标。
