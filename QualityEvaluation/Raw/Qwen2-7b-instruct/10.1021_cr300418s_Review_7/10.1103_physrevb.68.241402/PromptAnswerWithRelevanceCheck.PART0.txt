[1] "The importance of these defects in a variety of surface reactions has been stressed by several experimental and theoretical studies."
[2] "Molecular oxygen is typically used to restore the stoichiometry of ion-sputtered or vacuum-reduced TiO2 surfaces, and has a strong influence on the electronic properties, the geometric structure, and the chemical reactivity of these surfaces."
[3] "Adsorption energies (Ea) for the molecular (M1,M2) and dissociated (D1) states, and energy barriers (E#) for M2M1 diffusion and M1(M2) D1 dissociations on defective TiO2 110! surface."
[4] "The most stable molecular configuration is M1, in which the adsorbed O2 sits at the vacancy site with its axis parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the bridging oxygen rows, and forms bonds with the two nearest Ti atoms."
[5] "The process of BO capture by an OA corresponds to a D1M2 transition for which a lower bound estimate of the barrier is the difference in energy between the initial (D1) and final (M2) states, D1,2;3.4 eV."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. These vacancies are crucial for the adsorption of oxygen molecules and subsequent oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more easily formed oxygen vacancy, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more efficient oxygen adsorption and reaction pathways.

2. The significance of ΔEv in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface lies in its impact on the surface's reactivity towards oxygen molecules. Lower ΔEv values facilitate faster oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the surface's ability to adsorb oxygen and participate in oxidation reactions. This increased reactivity contributes to higher catalytic efficiency and stronger oxidizing capability, as the surface is better equipped to engage in key reactions that lead to oxidation products.

1. 汤斯-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式通过在氧化物表面上形成氧缺陷。这些缺陷对于氧气分子的吸附和后续氧化反应至关重要。氧缺陷形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv值意味着更容易形成氧缺陷，可能导致更高的催化活性和更强的氧化能力，因为表面能够更有效地吸附氧气并参与氧化反应。这种增强的反应性有助于提高催化效率和更强的氧化能力，因为它使表面更适合参与关键反应以生成氧化产物。

2. ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力中的重要性在于它对表面与氧气分子反应性的影响。较低的ΔEv值加速了氧缺陷的形成，增强了表面吸附氧气并参与氧化反应的能力。这种增加的活性有助于提高催化效率和更强的氧化能力，因为表面能够更好地参与到生成氧化产物的关键反应中。

[1] "The importance of these defects in a variety of surface reactions has been stressed by several experimental and theoretical studies. For instance, it has been shown that H2O dissociation on TiO2(110) only occurs at bridging oxygen vacancy sites."
[2] "Oxygen-assisted O vacancy diffusion thus results from transformations among the several different O2 adsorption states, of comparable energies and separated by not too large barriers, which are available especially when the O vacancy concentration is larger than that of adsorbed O2."
[3] "The surface properties of titanium dioxide have been intensively studied for many years due to the widespread use of this material in heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis, and for gas sensors."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction. When an oxygen vacancy is present, it allows for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which can then be involved in various oxidation processes. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation acts as an activation energy barrier for the reaction. The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in determining the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more easily formed oxygen vacancy, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests a less reactive surface, as it would require more energy to form an oxygen vacancy, thus affecting the efficiency of the oxidation reaction.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as active sites for oxygen adsorption. These sites facilitate the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which subsequently enables the oxidation of substrates through the assistance of these oxygen atoms. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the surface can easily create oxygen vacancies, enhancing its catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Therefore, the ΔEv serves as an indicator of the surface's efficiency in facilitating the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

[1] "In our calculations, the process of BO capture by an oxygen adatom corresponds to a D1M2 transition for which a lower bound estimate of the barrier is the difference in energy between the initial (D1) and final (M2) states, D1,2;3.4 eV."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen vacancies facilitate the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms between surface species. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which enhances the surface's reactivity by providing active sites for the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen molecules. These active sites enable more efficient electron transfer and the formation of reactive oxygen species, thereby increasing the surface's catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power. The energy barrier for oxygen atom capture by an oxygen adatom, estimated at 3.4 eV in the context described, seems too high to explain the findings observed in STM03. Instead, a more accessible pathway involving a two-step process, where the oxygen adatom first forms an intermediate state (M1) before transforming into the desired state (M2), is suggested.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作，其中氧空位促进了表面物种之间电子和氧原子的转移。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更稳定，这通过提供吸附和氧分子分解的活性位点增强了表面的反应性。这些活性位点能够更有效地促进电子转移并形成活性氧物种，从而提高表面的催化效率和氧化能力。描述的上下文中，氧原子被氧吸附体捕获的能量壁垒估计为3.4 eV，似乎无法解释STM03中的发现。相反，一个两步过程被建议，其中氧原子首先形成中间状态（M1），然后转变为所需状态（M2）。
