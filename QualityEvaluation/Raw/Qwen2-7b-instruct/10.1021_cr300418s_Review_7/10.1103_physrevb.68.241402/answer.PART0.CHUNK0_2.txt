[1] "The importance of these defects in a variety of surface reactions has been stressed by several experimental and theoretical studies. For instance, it has been shown that H2O dissociation on TiO2(110) only occurs at bridging oxygen vacancy sites."
[2] "Oxygen-assisted O vacancy diffusion thus results from transformations among the several different O2 adsorption states, of comparable energies and separated by not too large barriers, which are available especially when the O vacancy concentration is larger than that of adsorbed O2."
[3] "The surface properties of titanium dioxide have been intensively studied for many years due to the widespread use of this material in heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis, and for gas sensors."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction. When an oxygen vacancy is present, it allows for the adsorption of oxygen molecules, which can then be involved in various oxidation processes. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation acts as an activation energy barrier for the reaction. The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in determining the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more easily formed oxygen vacancy, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a higher ΔEv suggests a less reactive surface, as it would require more energy to form an oxygen vacancy, thus affecting the efficiency of the oxidation reaction.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的运作方式是通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。当存在氧空位时，它允许氧气分子的吸附，然后参与各种氧化过程。ΔEv的作用在于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较低的ΔEv表明更易形成氧空位，可能导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv则表明反应表面较不活跃，因为需要更多的能量来形成氧空位，从而影响氧化反应的效率。
