[1] "Dissociative adsorption was found to be the dominant channel for adsorption temperatures above 150 K,7 with oxygen adatoms being stable up to about 600 K."
[2] "The most stable molecular configuration is M1, in which the adsorbed O2 sits at the vacancy site with its axis parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the bridging oxygen rows, and forms bonds with the two nearest Ti atoms."
[3] "In the D1 state, the binding energy of the oxygen adatom, referred to the defect-free surface, is EOA = Etot(perf) - Etot(O) - Etot(D1); 2.2 eV, where Etot(D1) and Etot(O) are total energies of the D1 configuration, and the oxygen atom in the 3P state, respectively."
[4] "In addition, the M1M2 should become easier at higher vacancy concentrations, since M2 is in this case stabilized with respect to M1."

1. Dissociative adsorption is the primary mechanism for adsorption temperatures above 150 K, with oxygen adatoms remaining stable up to approximately 600 K.
2. The most stable molecular configuration involves oxygen adsorbing at the vacancy site, aligned parallel to the surface and perpendicular to the bridging oxygen rows, forming bonds with the two closest Ti atoms.
3. In the D1 state, the oxygen adatom's binding energy, relative to the defect-free surface, is 2.2 eV, calculated based on the total energies of the D1 configuration and the oxygen atom in the 3P state.
4. The M1M2 transition becomes more feasible at higher vacancy concentrations, as M2 stabilizes compared to M1.
5. The research was financially supported by the NSF Grant No. CHE-9977538.

1. 在大于150 K的吸附温度下，解离吸附是主要机制，氧原子吸附物在约600 K时保持稳定。
2. 最稳定的分子配置涉及氧气吸附在空位位置，与表面平行并垂直于桥接氧行，与最近的Ti原子形成键。
3. 在D1状态下，相对于无缺陷表面，氧原子的结合能为2.2 eV，基于D1配置和处于3P状态的氧原子的总能量计算得出。
4. 在更高空位浓度下，M1M2转换变得更加可行，因为M2相对于M1稳定。
5. 研究由NSF资助，项目编号为CHE-9977538。
