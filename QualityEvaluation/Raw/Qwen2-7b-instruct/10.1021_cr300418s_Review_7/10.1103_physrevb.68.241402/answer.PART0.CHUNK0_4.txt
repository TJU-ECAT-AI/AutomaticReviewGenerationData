[1] "In our calculations, the process of BO capture by an oxygen adatom corresponds to a D1M2 transition for which a lower bound estimate of the barrier is the difference in energy between the initial (D1) and final (M2) states, D1,2;3.4 eV."
[2] "This value appears to be too high to explain the findings in STM03."
[3] "Although rather large, the latter is definitely more accessible than that for the direct D1M2 process."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps where oxygen vacancies facilitate the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms between surface species. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy, which enhances the surface's reactivity by providing active sites for the adsorption and dissociation of oxygen molecules. These active sites enable more efficient electron transfer and the formation of reactive oxygen species, thereby increasing the surface's catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power. The energy barrier for oxygen atom capture by an oxygen adatom, estimated at 3.4 eV in the context described, seems too high to explain the findings observed in STM03. Instead, a more accessible pathway involving a two-step process, where the oxygen adatom first forms an intermediate state (M1) before transforming into the desired state (M2), is suggested.

火星-克雷韦伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤运作，其中氧空位促进了表面物种之间电子和氧原子的转移。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更稳定，这通过提供吸附和氧分子分解的活性位点增强了表面的反应性。这些活性位点能够更有效地促进电子转移并形成活性氧物种，从而提高表面的催化效率和氧化能力。描述的上下文中，氧原子被氧吸附体捕获的能量壁垒估计为3.4 eV，似乎无法解释STM03中的发现。相反，一个两步过程被建议，其中氧原子首先形成中间状态（M1），然后转变为所需状态（M2）。
