[1] "In the present density functional theory (DFT) study we continue to study the effect of Cu-doping, this time for bulk ceria. We will find that the first oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria is formed almost spontaneously and the formation of a second vacancy is also facile."
[2] "Whether zero, one or two oxy- gen vacancies, the Cu dopant is in the form Cu(+II), and prefers to be 4-coordinated in a close to planar structure."
[3] "Charge compensation, structural relaxation and available CuO states all play roles in lowering the O vacancy formation energies, but to different degrees when the first and second oxygen vacancies are formed."
[4] "The second Evac value (2.39 eV) for the Cu-doped system is 0.89 eV smaller than the first Evac value for undoped ceria bulk. We will find that this decrease is dominated by dopant-induced electronic structure changes."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which facilitates the oxidation process by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.
2. The Cu dopant in Cu-doped ceria is in the form of Cu(+II) and prefers a 4-coordinate, close-to-planar structure. The Cu dopant contributes to lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energies through charge compensation, structural relaxation, and the availability of CuO states, though the impact varies depending on whether the first or second oxygen vacancy is being formed.
3. The formation of the first oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria occurs almost spontaneously, and the creation of a second vacancy is also relatively easy. The energy required for the formation of a second oxygen vacancy is lower than that for the first vacancy, indicating that the second vacancy formation is facilitated by the presence of the first vacancy.
4. The second oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evac) in Cu-doped ceria is 0.89 eV lower than the first Evac in undoped ceria. This decrease is largely attributed to the electronic structure changes induced by the Cu dopant, suggesting that electronic effects play a dominant role in facilitating the formation of the second oxygen vacancy.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位来操作，这降低了反应所需的活化能。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv值意味着氧空位更容易形成，可能带来更高的催化活性和氧化能力。
2. Cu掺杂的铈中，Cu掺杂剂以Cu(+II)的形式存在，并倾向于在接近平面结构中以4价配位。Cu掺杂剂通过电荷补偿、结构松弛和可用的CuO状态降低氧空位形成能，但首次和第二次氧空位形成的程度不同。
3. Cu掺杂铈中，第一个氧空位的形成几乎是自发的，而第二个氧空位的形成也相对容易。形成第二个氧空位所需的能量低于第一个氧空位，表明第二个氧空位的形成受到第一个氧空位存在的促进。
4. Cu掺杂铈中的第二个氧空位形成能（Evac）比未掺杂铈中的第一个Evac低0.89 eV。这一下降主要归因于Cu掺杂剂引起的电子结构变化，表明电子效应在促进第二个氧空位形成方面起着主导作用。
