The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the case of Cu-doped ceria, the ΔEv decreases due to the presence of the dopant, facilitating the creation of oxygen vacancies more easily. This reduction in ΔEv leads to enhanced catalytic activity and increased oxidizing ability of the ceria surface. Specifically, the first oxygen vacancy forms almost spontaneously, and the second vacancy is also easily created, contributing to the improved performance of the material in catalytic processes. The electronic effects contribute significantly to this decrease in ΔEv, with structural relaxation also playing a role, albeit to a lesser extent.

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which facilitates the oxidation process by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.
2. The Cu dopant in Cu-doped ceria is in the form of Cu(+II) and prefers a 4-coordinate, close-to-planar structure. The Cu dopant contributes to lowering the oxygen vacancy formation energies through charge compensation, structural relaxation, and the availability of CuO states, though the impact varies depending on whether the first or second oxygen vacancy is being formed.
3. The formation of the first oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria occurs almost spontaneously, and the creation of a second vacancy is also relatively easy. The energy required for the formation of a second oxygen vacancy is lower than that for the first vacancy, indicating that the second vacancy formation is facilitated by the presence of the first vacancy.
4. The second oxygen vacancy formation energy (Evac) in Cu-doped ceria is 0.89 eV lower than the first Evac in undoped ceria. This decrease is largely attributed to the electronic structure changes induced by the Cu dopant, suggesting that electronic effects play a dominant role in facilitating the formation of the second oxygen vacancy.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位来操作，这降低了反应所需的活化能。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv值意味着氧空位更容易形成，可能带来更高的催化活性和氧化能力。
2. Cu掺杂的铈中，Cu掺杂剂以Cu(+II)的形式存在，并倾向于在接近平面结构中以4价配位。Cu掺杂剂通过电荷补偿、结构松弛和可用的CuO状态降低氧空位形成能，但首次和第二次氧空位形成的程度不同。
3. Cu掺杂铈中，第一个氧空位的形成几乎是自发的，而第二个氧空位的形成也相对容易。形成第二个氧空位所需的能量低于第一个氧空位，表明第二个氧空位的形成受到第一个氧空位存在的促进。
4. Cu掺杂铈中的第二个氧空位形成能（Evac）比未掺杂铈中的第一个Evac低0.89 eV。这一下降主要归因于Cu掺杂剂引起的电子结构变化，表明电子效应在促进第二个氧空位形成方面起着主导作用。

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of oxygen from the oxide surface to the reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it affects the surface's ability to adsorb reactants, promote the reaction, and release products. Lower ΔEv indicates a more active surface, enhancing both catalytic activity and oxidizing ability.

2. In the context of Cu-doped ceria, the presence of copper dopants leads to a reduction in the formation energy of oxygen vacancies. This is attributed to both electronic structure changes and structural relaxation effects. The analysis reveals that for the first oxygen vacancy, approximately half of the decrease in formation energy is due to electronic effects, while the rest is attributed to structural changes. For the second oxygen vacancy, the decrease is entirely due to electronic effects.

3. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a pivotal role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest a more efficient surface for catalysis, as it facilitates easier vacancy formation and subsequent reaction steps. This leads to enhanced activity and better performance in oxidation reactions.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进表面氧向反应物的转移而起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对决定氧化物表面的活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值表明表面更活跃，从而增强催化活性和氧化能力。

2. 在掺铜铈氧化物的背景下，铜掺杂导致氧空位形成能显著降低。分析表明，对于第一个氧空位，大约一半的形成能降低归因于电子结构变化，其余部分归因于结构变化。对于第二个氧空位，全部的降低归因于电子效应。

3. 氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面发挥关键作用。较低的ΔEv值表明表面更有效，因为它更容易形成氧空位并随后进行反应步骤。这导致活性增强和更好的氧化反应性能。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through a series of steps where an oxide surface acts as a catalyst in oxidation reactions. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences these properties. In Cu-doped ceria, the ΔEv is notably lower due to the presence of copper, which facilitates the spontaneous creation of oxygen vacancies. This reduction in ΔEv allows for more efficient oxygen adsorption and desorption processes, thereby increasing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability. Specifically, the presence of copper ions in a close-to-planar structure with a coordination number of 4 stabilizes the oxygen vacancies, reducing the energy barrier for their formation. This stabilization is attributed to both electronic effects, such as the redistribution of charge and the opening of available electron states, and structural relaxation, which involves the adjustment of lattice parameters to accommodate the vacancies. The balance between electronic and structural contributions varies depending on whether the first or second oxygen vacancy is being formed. When the first vacancy is created, approximately half of the energy reduction is due to electronic effects, while the remaining half is attributed to structural relaxation. For the second vacancy, electronic effects account for the entire decrease in ΔEv, as the smaller relaxation energy actually increases the ΔEv value compared to undoped ceria.

火星-范克雷威尔机制通过一系列步骤在氧化反应中作用于氧化物表面，充当催化剂。氧空位在增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）显著影响这些性质。在铜掺杂的铈中，由于铜的存在，ΔEv明显降低，这促进了氧空位的自发形成。由于铜离子在接近平面结构中的4配位数稳定了氧空位，从而降低了形成空位的能量壁垒，这增加了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。具体来说，铜离子以4个氧原子的配位数稳定在接近平面的结构中，这稳定了氧空位并减少了形成空位的能量壁垒。这种稳定性归因于电子效应和结构松弛的结合，电子效应涉及电荷的重新分布和可用电子状态的开放，而结构松弛涉及调整晶格参数以适应空位。形成的第一个空位时，大约一半的能量减少归因于电子效应，剩余的一半归因于结构松弛。对于第二个空位，整个能量减少完全归因于电子效应，因为较小的松弛能量实际上增加了与未掺杂铈相比的ΔEv值。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the process, the formation of oxygen vacancies facilitates the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, enhancing the catalytic activity. The energy barrier associated with oxygen vacancy formation influences the reaction kinetics, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen vacancy formation, potentially leading to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more accessible reactive sites on the oxide surface.
