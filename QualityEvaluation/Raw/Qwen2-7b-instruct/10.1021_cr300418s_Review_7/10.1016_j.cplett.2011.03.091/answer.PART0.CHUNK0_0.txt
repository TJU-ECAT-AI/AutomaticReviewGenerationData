[1] "For the WGS and the SOFC applications, the literature suggests that it is copper metal at the Cu/ceria interface that is particularly active."
[2] "Controlled experiments reported in the literature give some information about the structure and dynamics of Cu-doped ceria solid solutions."
[3] "In the present density functional theory (DFT) study we continue to study the effect of Cu-doping, this time for bulk ceria."
[4] "An O vacancy was introduced as a nearest-neighbor (NN) to the Cu dopant, the structure was reoptimized, and Evac was calculated to 0.98 eV, which is much smaller than for undoped ceria (3.28 eV in our calculations)."
[5] "For the first vacancy, the lowering is as large as 2.98 eV and our analysis shows that about half of this decrease can be attributed to electronic effects and half to large structural relaxation when the Cu dopant is present."
[6] "Hereafter, the blue sphere represents the O vacancy and # (in forthcoming figures) denotes a reduced Cerium (Ce3+)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the case of Cu-doped ceria, the ΔEv decreases due to the presence of the dopant, facilitating the creation of oxygen vacancies more easily. This reduction in ΔEv leads to enhanced catalytic activity and increased oxidizing ability of the ceria surface. Specifically, the first oxygen vacancy forms almost spontaneously, and the second vacancy is also easily created, contributing to the improved performance of the material in catalytic processes. The electronic effects contribute significantly to this decrease in ΔEv, with structural relaxation also playing a role, albeit to a lesser extent.

火星-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成和利用氧空位起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。对于Cu掺杂的铈，由于掺杂剂的存在，ΔEv的降低使得氧空位的创建更加容易。这种ΔEv的减少导致材料的催化活性和氧化能力增强。具体来说，第一个氧空位几乎可以自发形成，第二个氧空位的形成也变得容易，从而提高了材料在催化过程中的性能。电子效应对这一ΔEv的降低贡献显著，结构松弛也起到了一定的作用，但程度较小。
