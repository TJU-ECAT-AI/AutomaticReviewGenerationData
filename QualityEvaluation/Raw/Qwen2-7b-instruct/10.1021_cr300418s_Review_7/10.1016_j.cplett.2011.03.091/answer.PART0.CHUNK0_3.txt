[1] "In the present Letter we discuss Cu-doped ceria."
[2] "The first oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria forms almost spontaneously and the second vacancy is also easily created."
[3] "Charge compensation, structural relaxation and available CuO states all play roles in lowering the O vacancy formation energies, but to different degrees when the first and second oxygen vacancies are formed."
[4] "The lowering is as large as 2.98 eV and our analysis shows that about half of this decrease can be attributed to electronic effects and half to large structural relaxation when the Cu dopant is present."
[5] "Here the electronic effects are responsible for 100% of the decrease, since the smaller relaxation energy actually increases the Evac value compared to undoped ceria."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through a series of steps where an oxide surface acts as a catalyst in oxidation reactions. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences these properties. In Cu-doped ceria, the ΔEv is notably lower due to the presence of copper, which facilitates the spontaneous creation of oxygen vacancies. This reduction in ΔEv allows for more efficient oxygen adsorption and desorption processes, thereby increasing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing capability. Specifically, the presence of copper ions in a close-to-planar structure with a coordination number of 4 stabilizes the oxygen vacancies, reducing the energy barrier for their formation. This stabilization is attributed to both electronic effects, such as the redistribution of charge and the opening of available electron states, and structural relaxation, which involves the adjustment of lattice parameters to accommodate the vacancies. The balance between electronic and structural contributions varies depending on whether the first or second oxygen vacancy is being formed. When the first vacancy is created, approximately half of the energy reduction is due to electronic effects, while the remaining half is attributed to structural relaxation. For the second vacancy, electronic effects account for the entire decrease in ΔEv, as the smaller relaxation energy actually increases the ΔEv value compared to undoped ceria.

火星-范克雷威尔机制通过一系列步骤在氧化反应中作用于氧化物表面，充当催化剂。氧空位在增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）显著影响这些性质。在铜掺杂的铈中，由于铜的存在，ΔEv明显降低，这促进了氧空位的自发形成。由于铜离子在接近平面结构中的4配位数稳定了氧空位，从而降低了形成空位的能量壁垒，这增加了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。具体来说，铜离子以4个氧原子的配位数稳定在接近平面的结构中，这稳定了氧空位并减少了形成空位的能量壁垒。这种稳定性归因于电子效应和结构松弛的结合，电子效应涉及电荷的重新分布和可用电子状态的开放，而结构松弛涉及调整晶格参数以适应空位。形成的第一个空位时，大约一半的能量减少归因于电子效应，剩余的一半归因于结构松弛。对于第二个空位，整个能量减少完全归因于电子效应，因为较小的松弛能量实际上增加了与未掺杂铈相比的ΔEv值。
