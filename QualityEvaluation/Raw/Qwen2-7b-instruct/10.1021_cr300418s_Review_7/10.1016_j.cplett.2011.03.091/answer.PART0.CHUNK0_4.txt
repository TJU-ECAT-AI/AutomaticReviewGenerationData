[1] "Several studies in the literature have shown that copperceria systems (CuCeO2) are efficient catalysts for the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction, the reduction of SO2 by CO, and the selective hydrogen combustion reaction."
[2] "CuCeO2 systems are also interesting in the context of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology due to the excellent electronic conductivity of Cu and the high catalytic activity of CeO2 for CH bond breaking in CH4, especially when mixed with particular noble metal dopants."
[3] "Controlled experiments reported in the literature give some information about the structure and dynamics of Cu-doped ceria solid solutions."
[4] "Electrical conductivity measurements have shown that a CuxCe1xO2d (0 6 x 6 0.10) solid solution exhibits good oxide-ion conductivity."
[5] "Their EXAFS fits indicated a CuO coordination number of 56 (while their quantum mechanical calculations suggested that the Cu atom in bulk ceria has four oxygen atom neighbors at a distance of 1.921.95 Å)."
[6] "Moreover, in their experiments they also found that the Cu dopants always gave rise to a corresponding number of O vacancies, i.e. that vacancy formation is very much facilitated by Cu doping and the oxygen storage capacity remarkably enhanced."
[7] "As mentioned, Wang et al. studied bulk CeO2, CuO, Cu2O, Cu0.25Ce0.75O2 and Cu0.125Ce0.875O2."
[8] "The current calculations for stoichiometric ceria give an equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.480 Å; the experimental room-temperature value is 5.411 Å."
[9] "For Cu-doped bulk, a supercell containing 96 atoms was built from the conventional 12-atom cubic unit cell of CeO2 with a 2  2  2 replication and one Ce atom was replaced by a Cu atom."
[10] "Oxygen vacancies were created in various positions with respective to the Cu dopant; details are given in the Results and discussion section."
[11] "The O vacancy formation energy (Evac) was calculated after optimization of the atomic positions for each system according to the formula provided."
[12] "Results for the ceria(1 1 1) surface are given in Table 1 for comparison and are discussed in Section 3.3."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. In the process, the formation of oxygen vacancies facilitates the adsorption of reactants and intermediates, enhancing the catalytic activity. The energy barrier associated with oxygen vacancy formation influences the reaction kinetics, thereby affecting the overall catalytic performance. A lower ΔEv indicates a higher tendency for oxygen vacancy formation, potentially leading to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power due to more accessible reactive sites on the oxide surface.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。在这个过程中，氧气空位的形成促进了反应物和中间体的吸附，增强了催化活性。与氧气空位形成相关的能量壁垒影响了反应动力学，从而影响了整体催化性能。较低的ΔEv表明氧气空位形成的倾向性较高，可能由于表面更易接触的活性位点导致了增强的催化活性和氧化能力。
