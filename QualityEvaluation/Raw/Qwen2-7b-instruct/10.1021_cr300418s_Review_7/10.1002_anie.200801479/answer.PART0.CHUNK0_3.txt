[1] "Although extended gold surfaces are generally considered chemically inert1,2 nanosized (<5nm) gold particles can be very effective catalysts for a number of oxidation reactions.317"
[2] "The high catalytic activity of nanosized gold clusters at low temperature is found to be related to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to activate reactants."
[3] "The origin of the nanoeffects in the catalytic properties of these metals is widely debated,15 and no consensus has been reached."
[4] "The adsorption is considerably more exothermic on the twelve-atom clusters than on the close-packed surfaces."
[5] "Gold is closest to the top, followed by palladium and silver."
[6] "The results in Figure2 and Figure4 are in good agreement with available experimental observations.3,32"

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv typically indicates a more favorable environment for the mechanism, leading to enhanced activity and oxidizing capability.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）运作。氧空位形成的能量要求对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。较低的ΔEv通常表示更有利于该机制的环境，从而提高活性和氧化能力。
