[1] "Although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature."
[2] "Adsorption is considerably more exothermic on the twelve-atom clusters than on the close-packed surfaces. This makes it important to include another elementary reaction, as the coverage of molecular O2 may be large enough such that an associative mechanism may be important."
[3] "The results in Figure2 and Figure4 are in good agreement with available experimental observations."
[4] "The present analysis suggests that the more noble metals move to the maximum in the reactivity volcano when lower-coordinated metal atoms serve as active sites for the reaction."
[5] "For gold, the corner atoms will dominate over the close-packed surfaces for even quite large particles, as the value of rS is many orders of magnitude larger in this case."

1. Gold nanoparticles exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activity compared to other metal nanoparticles for CO oxidation, especially at low temperatures. This is attributed to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to effectively activate reactants.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on oxide surfaces during oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.

3. The analysis conducted supports the hypothesis that gold nanoparticles display superior catalytic properties due to the special ability of their metal atoms to activate reactants, particularly at low-coordinate sites.

4. The reactivity of nanoparticles, especially gold, is influenced by the coordination number of the metal atoms. Gold nanoparticles, with their corner atoms, demonstrate markedly higher catalytic activity than close-packed surfaces, even in relatively large particles.

5. The study indicates that noble metals tend to occupy the peak of the reactivity volcano when lower-coordinated metal atoms act as active sites for specific reactions, suggesting potential for similar nanoeffects in various catalytic processes.

1. 在低温下，金纳米粒子在CO氧化反应中展现出显著增强的催化活性，与其它金属纳米粒子相比。这归因于低配位金属原子有效激活反应物的能力。

2. Mars-van Krevelen机制通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）在氧化反应中的氧化物表面进行操作。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。

3. 执行的分析支持以下假设：由于其金属原子能够激活反应物，特别是低配位点，因此金纳米颗粒表现出优越的催化特性。

4. 纳米粒子，尤其是金，受金属原子配位数的影响。即使是相对较大的粒子，金纳米颗粒的角原子也显示出比紧密排列表面高得多的催化活性。

5. 研究表明，当较低配位的金属原子作为特定反应的活性位点时，贵金属倾向于占据反应性火山的顶峰，这可能为各种催化过程中的类似纳米效应提供潜在可能性。
