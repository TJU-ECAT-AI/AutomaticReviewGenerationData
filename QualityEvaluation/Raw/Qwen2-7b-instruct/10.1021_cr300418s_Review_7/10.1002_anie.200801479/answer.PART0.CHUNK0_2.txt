[1] "The high catalytic activity of nanosized gold clusters at low temperature is found to be related to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to activate reactants."
[2] "Although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature."
[3] "The ability of the metal atoms to activate reactants change substantially as the coordination number of the active metal site is reduced at corners of metal particles."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv indicates a greater energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, which can lead to a more selective catalytic environment. This mechanism allows for the control of reaction pathways, enhancing the efficiency of oxidation processes. The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in balancing the reactivity of the oxide surface, affecting whether the surface prefers to form oxygen vacancies or maintain a stable oxide structure during oxidation reactions. This balance influences the surface's ability to effectively oxidize substrates, impacting both the speed and selectivity of the catalytic process.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv意味着氧空位形成具有更大的能量壁垒，这可以导致更选择性的催化环境。这种机制允许控制反应途径，提高氧化过程的效率。ΔEv的重要性在于其在平衡氧化物表面活性方面的作用，影响氧化物表面是否倾向于形成氧空位或维持稳定的氧化物结构。这种平衡影响表面有效氧化底物的能力，从而影响催化过程的速度和选择性。
