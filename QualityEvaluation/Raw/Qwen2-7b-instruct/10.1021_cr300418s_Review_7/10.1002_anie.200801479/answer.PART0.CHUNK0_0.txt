Trends in the Catalytic CO Oxidation Activity of Nanoparticles Graphical Abstract Going for gold: Density functional calculations show how gold nanoparticles are more active catalysts for CO oxidation than other metal nanoparticles.
Although extended gold surfaces are generally considered chemically inert1,2 nanosized (<5nm) gold particles can be very effective catalysts for a number of oxidation reactions.317
The origin of the nanoeffects in the catalytic properties of these metals is widely debated,15 and no consensus has been reached.
Based on a set of density functional theory calculations of the full reaction pathway for CO oxidation over extended surfaces as well as over small nanoparticles of a number of metals, we show that although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature.
The calculations capture the special catalytic properties of nanosized particles observed experimentally, which allows the origin of the effect to be analyzed.

Answer: Gold nanoparticles exhibit higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to other metal nanoparticles, especially at low temperatures. This is attributed to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms within the gold nanoparticles to effectively activate reactants. The density functional theory calculations support the experimental observations and elucidate the origin of this enhanced catalytic property.
