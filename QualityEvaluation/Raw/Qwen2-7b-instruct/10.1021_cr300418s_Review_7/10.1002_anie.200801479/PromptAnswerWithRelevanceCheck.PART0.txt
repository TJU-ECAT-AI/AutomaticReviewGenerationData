Trends in the Catalytic CO Oxidation Activity of Nanoparticles Graphical Abstract Going for gold: Density functional calculations show how gold nanoparticles are more active catalysts for CO oxidation than other metal nanoparticles.
Although extended gold surfaces are generally considered chemically inert1,2 nanosized (<5nm) gold particles can be very effective catalysts for a number of oxidation reactions.317
The origin of the nanoeffects in the catalytic properties of these metals is widely debated,15 and no consensus has been reached.
Based on a set of density functional theory calculations of the full reaction pathway for CO oxidation over extended surfaces as well as over small nanoparticles of a number of metals, we show that although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature.
The calculations capture the special catalytic properties of nanosized particles observed experimentally, which allows the origin of the effect to be analyzed.

Answer: Gold nanoparticles exhibit higher catalytic activity for CO oxidation compared to other metal nanoparticles, especially at low temperatures. This is attributed to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms within the gold nanoparticles to effectively activate reactants. The density functional theory calculations support the experimental observations and elucidate the origin of this enhanced catalytic property.

[1] "The high catalytic activity of nanosized gold clusters at low temperature is found to be related to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to activate reactants."
[2] "Although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature."
[3] "The ability of the metal atoms to activate reactants change substantially as the coordination number of the active metal site is reduced at corners of metal particles."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv indicates a greater energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, which can lead to a more selective catalytic environment. This mechanism allows for the control of reaction pathways, enhancing the efficiency of oxidation processes. The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in balancing the reactivity of the oxide surface, affecting whether the surface prefers to form oxygen vacancies or maintain a stable oxide structure during oxidation reactions. This balance influences the surface's ability to effectively oxidize substrates, impacting both the speed and selectivity of the catalytic process.

火星-范克列文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。较高的ΔEv意味着氧空位形成具有更大的能量壁垒，这可以导致更选择性的催化环境。这种机制允许控制反应途径，提高氧化过程的效率。ΔEv的重要性在于其在平衡氧化物表面活性方面的作用，影响氧化物表面是否倾向于形成氧空位或维持稳定的氧化物结构。这种平衡影响表面有效氧化底物的能力，从而影响催化过程的速度和选择性。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv typically indicates a more favorable environment for the mechanism, leading to enhanced activity and oxidizing capability.

[1] "Although platinum and palladium are the most active catalysts for extended surfaces at high temperatures, gold is the most active for very small particles at low temperature."
[2] "Adsorption is considerably more exothermic on the twelve-atom clusters than on the close-packed surfaces. This makes it important to include another elementary reaction, as the coverage of molecular O2 may be large enough such that an associative mechanism may be important."
[3] "The results in Figure2 and Figure4 are in good agreement with available experimental observations."
[4] "The present analysis suggests that the more noble metals move to the maximum in the reactivity volcano when lower-coordinated metal atoms serve as active sites for the reaction."
[5] "For gold, the corner atoms will dominate over the close-packed surfaces for even quite large particles, as the value of rS is many orders of magnitude larger in this case."

1. Gold nanoparticles exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic activity compared to other metal nanoparticles for CO oxidation, especially at low temperatures. This is attributed to the ability of low-coordinate metal atoms to effectively activate reactants.

2. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on oxide surfaces during oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.

3. The analysis conducted supports the hypothesis that gold nanoparticles display superior catalytic properties due to the special ability of their metal atoms to activate reactants, particularly at low-coordinate sites.

4. The reactivity of nanoparticles, especially gold, is influenced by the coordination number of the metal atoms. Gold nanoparticles, with their corner atoms, demonstrate markedly higher catalytic activity than close-packed surfaces, even in relatively large particles.

5. The study indicates that noble metals tend to occupy the peak of the reactivity volcano when lower-coordinated metal atoms act as active sites for specific reactions, suggesting potential for similar nanoeffects in various catalytic processes.
