[1] "The energy needed for removing one in six oxygen atoms from the surface of 5L ZnO(1010) is 3.31 eV/supercell and this process is endothermic."
[2] "In the case of the ZnO(0001) VTF, the removal of 1 oxygen atom (out of 16 surface O atoms) from the surface to form 1/2O2 is exothermic."
[3] "The exothermic nature of SOVFE means that at equilibrium in the absence of gaseous oxygen and at a temperature of 0 K, the surface is much more likely to have 1 oxygen vacancy per 16 surface oxygen sites than to be stoichiometric."
[4] "The energy for creating the second VO is indicative of the oxidizing power of the ZnO(0001) face."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. Removing one in six oxygen atoms from the surface of 5L ZnO(1010) is an endothermic process, requiring 3.31 eV/supercell.
2. Removing one oxygen atom out of 16 from the surface of ZnO(0001) VTF is exothermic, indicating the surface is likely to have oxygen vacancies.
3. The equilibrium concentration of oxygen vacancies on the surface depends on the magnitude of the energy of formation, oxygen pressure, temperature, and film thickness.
4. The energy required for creating the second oxygen vacancy determines the oxidizing power of the ZnO(0001) surface.

1. 从5L ZnO(1010)表面移除一个六分之一氧原子是一个吸热过程，需要3.31 eV/supercell。
2. 从ZnO(0001) VTF表面移除一个氧原子是放热的，表明表面更有可能存在氧空位。
3. 表面氧空位的平衡浓度取决于形成能的大小、氧气压力、温度和薄膜厚度。
4. 创建第二个氧空位所需的能量决定了ZnO(0001)表面的氧化能力。
