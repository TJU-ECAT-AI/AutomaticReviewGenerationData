[1] "The chemical activity of some oxides can be modified by increasing their area per gram."
[2] "In a nanoparticle, it is possible to stabilize a structure different from the bulk phase."
[3] "The formation of the VO from the surface of the ZnO(0001) VTF decreases the interplanar distance along the (0001) direction in the entire film, making its structure wurtzite-like."
[4] "The formation of the first oxygen vacancy is exothermic, which means that the thermodynamically stable ZnO(0001) VTF will have a wurtzite structure with oxygen vacancies at its surface."
[5] "The formation of an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the undoped (0001) VTF is exothermic. Therefore, unless the VTF is exposed to a very high oxygen pressure, this surface will have vacancies on it even in the absence of a reducing agent."
[6] "The exothermic nature of SOVFE means that at equilibrium in the absence of gaseous oxygen and at a temperature of 0 K, the surface is much more likely to have 1 oxygen vacancy per 16 surface oxygen sites than to be stoichiometric."
[7] "The stable state of the undoped ZnO(0001) VTF has a VO on it. Therefore, a reducing agent (e.g., CO) coming in contact with this surface will react with a surface that already has an oxygen vacancy on it and will have to create a second VO."
[8] "The energy for creating a second VO from the undoped ZnO(0001) VTF is larger than the energy required to form the first VO in the ZnO(0001) VTF doped with Cu, Ag, or Au."
[9] "Removing an oxygen atom from the surface of the VTF to form the VTF with a vacancy and 1/2O2 in the gas-phase is an exothermic process."

[11] "At reasonable oxygen pressure and not too high a temperature, and in the absence of a reducing agent, the doped surface has a negligible number of vacancies."
[12] "When the dopant is Au, or Ag, and or Cu, ΔEd < ΔE, which means that these dopants facilitate oxidation: the doped VTF is a better oxidant than the undoped VTF."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the surface of the oxide to supply oxygen molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically:

1. The energy ΔEv is the measure of the oxidative power of the oxide surface in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. It determines the ease of forming oxygen vacancies, which is essential for the reaction to proceed.

2. If ΔEv is low, it means that oxygen vacancies are easier to form, thus indicating a higher oxidative power. This implies that the oxide is capable of reacting with gaseous oxygen and recovering the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction more efficiently.

3. The presence of oxygen vacancies facilitates the reaction by providing reactive sites for the oxygen molecules to bind and undergo oxidation. The energy barrier for forming these vacancies sets the threshold for the reaction to start.

4. By altering the ΔEv through doping, the oxidizing power of the oxide surface can be significantly changed. Dopants that lower ΔEv, such as Au, Ag, and Cu, facilitate oxidation by making it easier for oxygen vacancies to form. This results in a better oxidant performance compared to the undoped surface.

5. Conversely, dopants that increase ΔEv, like Al and Ga, hinder the formation of oxygen vacancies and thus decrease the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. They make the oxide less efficient in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

6. The concentration of surface oxygen vacancies can be manipulated by changing the thickness of the VTF or the type of doping agent used. This allows for precise control over the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, potentially optimizing its performance in various applications.

火星-范克列伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面提供氧分子来运行。氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。具体而言：

1. ΔEv是氧化物表面在火星-范克列伦机制中的氧化能力的度量标准。它决定了形成氧气空位的易程度，这是反应进行的前提。

2. 如果ΔEv低，则意味着更容易形成氧气空位，这表明氧化能力更高。这意味着氧化物能够更有效地与气态氧分子反应并回收捐赠的氧。

3. 氧气空位的存在促进了反应，因为提供了氧分子结合并进行氧化的活性位点。形成这些空位的能量壁垒设定了反应开始的阈值。

4. 通过掺杂改变ΔEv，可以显著改变氧化物表面的氧化性能。如金、银、铜等掺杂物降低ΔEv，促进氧化，使氧化物表面比未掺杂表面具有更好的氧化性能。

5. 反之，铝和镓等掺杂物增加ΔEv，阻碍氧气空位的形成，从而降低氧化物的氧化能力。它们使氧化物在火星-范克列伦机制中效率较低。

6. 通过改变薄膜的厚度或掺杂剂类型，可以控制表面氧气空位的浓度。这允许精确控制氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，可能优化其在各种应用中的性能。
