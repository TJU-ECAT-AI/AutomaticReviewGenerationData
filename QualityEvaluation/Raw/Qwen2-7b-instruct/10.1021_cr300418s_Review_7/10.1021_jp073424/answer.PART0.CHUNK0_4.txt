[1] "The stoichiometric ZnO(0001) VTF is not stable with respect to oxygen vacancy formation: removing one oxygen atom from the surface to form the VTF with a vacancy and 1/2O2 in the gas-phase is an exothermic process."
[2] "The energy for forming an oxygen vacancy at the surface of the film shows a strong dependence on film thickness. This suggests that the equilibrium concentration of oxygen vacancies is a thickness-dependent property."
[3] "The formation of an additional oxygen vacancy is endothermic and we denote this energy by ΔE. This is the energy characterizing the oxidative power of the undoped VTF."
[4] "The energy of oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of the doped (0001) VTF is endothermic and we denote it as ΔEd."
[5] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism, doping ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power of the oxide surface and Al and Ga should decrease it."

1. Oxygen vacancy formation in the ZnO(0001) surface is an exothermic process, indicating that the stoichiometric surface is not stable towards oxygen vacancy formation.
2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation exhibits a strong dependency on the film thickness, suggesting that the equilibrium concentration of oxygen vacancies varies with thickness.
3. The energy needed for the formation of an additional oxygen vacancy is denoted as ΔE, which characterizes the oxidative power of the undoped VTF.
4. The energy for oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of the doped ZnO(0001) VTF is endothermic, represented as ΔEd.
5. Doping the ZnO surface with Au, Ag, or Cu facilitates oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the oxidative power, while Al and Ga have the opposite effect.

1. ZnO(0001)表面的氧空位形成是一个放热过程，表明该表面在氧空位形成方面的稳定性较差。
2. 氧空位形成所需的能量对薄膜厚度有很强的依赖性，表明氧空位的平衡浓度随厚度变化。
3. 形成额外氧空位所需的能量表示为ΔE，用于表征未掺杂VTF的氧化性能。
4. doped ZnO(0001) VTF表面氧空位形成的能量是吸热的，表示为ΔEd。
5. Au、Ag或Cu掺杂ZnO表面促进氧空位形成，增加氧化性能，而Al和Ga则相反。
