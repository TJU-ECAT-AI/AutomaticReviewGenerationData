[1] "The formation of the VO from the surface of the ZnO(0001) VTF decreases the interplanar distance along the (0001) direction in the entire film, making its structure wurtzite-like."
[2] "The exothermic nature of SOVFE means that at equilibrium in the absence of gaseous oxygen and at a temperature of 0 K, the surface is much more likely to have 1 oxygen vacancy per 16 surface oxygen sites than to be stoichiometric."
[3] "As vacancy formation from the ZnO(0001) VTF is exothermic, the film will have oxygen vacancies in its surface layer at thermodynamic equilibrium. Their concentration will depend on the magnitude of the energy of formation, the oxygen pressure, the temperature, and the film thickness."
[4] "Doping with Al or Ga makes this reaction more difficult."
[5] "Since the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is a measure of the oxidative power of the oxide in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism, doping ZnO surface with Au, or Ag, or Cu should increase the oxidative power of the oxide surface and Al and Ga should decrease it."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by supplying oxygen from the surface of the oxide to the molecule being oxidized. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. If ΔEv is low, the oxide is more likely to form oxygen vacancies, enhancing its oxidizing power and catalytic activity.

2. In the absence of gaseous oxygen and at a temperature of 0 K, the surface of the oxide is more likely to have 1 oxygen vacancy per 16 surface oxygen sites due to the exothermic nature of the oxygen vacancy formation process.

3. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in the oxide surface is influenced by the energy of formation, oxygen pressure, temperature, and film thickness. A lower ΔEv leads to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies at thermodynamic equilibrium.

4. Doping the oxide with aluminum or gallium makes it more difficult to form oxygen vacancies, thus decreasing the oxide's oxidizing power and catalytic activity.

5. By doping zinc oxide surfaces with gold, silver, or copper, the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is increased, thereby enhancing the oxidative power of the oxide surface. Conversely, doping with aluminum or gallium decreases the oxidative power.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过从氧化物表面提供氧气来工作。氧空位形成过程的能量要求（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。如果ΔEv较低，则氧化物更有可能形成氧空位，从而增强其氧化能力和催化活性。

2. 在没有气体氧气且温度为0 K的情况下，由于氧空位形成过程的放热性质，氧化物表面每16个表面氧原子更有可能存在1个氧空位。

3. 氧化物表面的氧空位浓度受形成能量、氧气压力、温度和薄膜厚度的影响。形成能量较低导致氧化物表面的氧空位浓度较高。

4. 向氧化物掺杂铝或镓使形成氧空位变得更加困难，从而降低氧化物的氧化性和催化活性。

5. 通过在锌氧化合物表面上掺杂金、银或铜，可以增加形成氧空位的便利性，从而增强氧化物表面的氧化性。相反，掺杂铝或镓会降低氧化性。
