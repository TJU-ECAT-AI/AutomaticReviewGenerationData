1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by supplying oxygen from the surface of the oxide to the molecule being oxidized. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. If ΔEv is low, the oxide is more likely to form oxygen vacancies, enhancing its oxidizing power and catalytic activity.

2. In the absence of gaseous oxygen and at a temperature of 0 K, the surface of the oxide is more likely to have 1 oxygen vacancy per 16 surface oxygen sites due to the exothermic nature of the oxygen vacancy formation process.

3. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in the oxide surface is influenced by the energy of formation, oxygen pressure, temperature, and film thickness. A lower ΔEv leads to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies at thermodynamic equilibrium.

4. Doping the oxide with aluminum or gallium makes it more difficult to form oxygen vacancies, thus decreasing the oxide's oxidizing power and catalytic activity.

5. By doping zinc oxide surfaces with gold, silver, or copper, the ease of forming oxygen vacancies is increased, thereby enhancing the oxidative power of the oxide surface. Conversely, doping with aluminum or gallium decreases the oxidative power.

1. 在氧化物催化氧化反应中，Mars-van Krevelen机制通过从氧化物表面提供氧气来工作。氧空位形成过程的能量要求（ΔEv）决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。如果ΔEv较低，则氧化物更有可能形成氧空位，从而增强其氧化能力和催化活性。

2. 在没有气体氧气且温度为0 K的情况下，由于氧空位形成过程的放热性质，氧化物表面每16个表面氧原子更有可能存在1个氧空位。

3. 氧化物表面的氧空位浓度受形成能量、氧气压力、温度和薄膜厚度的影响。形成能量较低导致氧化物表面的氧空位浓度较高。

4. 向氧化物掺杂铝或镓使形成氧空位变得更加困难，从而降低氧化物的氧化性和催化活性。

5. 通过在锌氧化合物表面上掺杂金、银或铜，可以增加形成氧空位的便利性，从而增强氧化物表面的氧化性。相反，掺杂铝或镓会降低氧化性。

1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. An exothermic ΔEv suggests that the surface is likely to have oxygen vacancies at thermodynamic equilibrium, enhancing the oxidizing power of the oxide.

2. The energy needed for creating the second oxygen vacancy at a distance of 11.36 Å from the first vacancy is denoted as ΔE. This energy characterizes the oxidative power of the oxide surface in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

3. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of the doped (0001) VTF is endothermic, indicated as ΔEd. At reasonable oxygen pressure and temperature, without a reducing agent, the doped surface has a negligible number of vacancies. Dopants like Au, Ag, and Cu facilitate oxygen vacancy formation, leading to an increased oxidative power of the oxide surface compared to undoped VTF. Conversely, Al and Ga have the opposite effect, hindering oxygen vacancy formation.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the surface of the oxide to supply oxygen molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Specifically:

1. The energy ΔEv is the measure of the oxidative power of the oxide surface in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. It determines the ease of forming oxygen vacancies, which is essential for the reaction to proceed.

2. If ΔEv is low, it means that oxygen vacancies are easier to form, thus indicating a higher oxidative power. This implies that the oxide is capable of reacting with gaseous oxygen and recovering the oxygen it has donated during the oxidation reaction more efficiently.

3. The presence of oxygen vacancies facilitates the reaction by providing reactive sites for the oxygen molecules to bind and undergo oxidation. The energy barrier for forming these vacancies sets the threshold for the reaction to start.

4. By altering the ΔEv through doping, the oxidizing power of the oxide surface can be significantly changed. Dopants that lower ΔEv, such as Au, Ag, and Cu, facilitate oxidation by making it easier for oxygen vacancies to form. This results in a better oxidant performance compared to the undoped surface.

5. Conversely, dopants that increase ΔEv, like Al and Ga, hinder the formation of oxygen vacancies and thus decrease the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. They make the oxide less efficient in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

6. The concentration of surface oxygen vacancies can be manipulated by changing the thickness of the VTF or the type of doping agent used. This allows for precise control over the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, potentially optimizing its performance in various applications.

火星-范克列伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物表面提供氧分子来运行。氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。具体而言：

1. ΔEv是氧化物表面在火星-范克列伦机制中的氧化能力的度量标准。它决定了形成氧气空位的易程度，这是反应进行的前提。

2. 如果ΔEv低，则意味着更容易形成氧气空位，这表明氧化能力更高。这意味着氧化物能够更有效地与气态氧分子反应并回收捐赠的氧。

3. 氧气空位的存在促进了反应，因为提供了氧分子结合并进行氧化的活性位点。形成这些空位的能量壁垒设定了反应开始的阈值。

4. 通过掺杂改变ΔEv，可以显著改变氧化物表面的氧化性能。如金、银、铜等掺杂物降低ΔEv，促进氧化，使氧化物表面比未掺杂表面具有更好的氧化性能。

5. 反之，铝和镓等掺杂物增加ΔEv，阻碍氧气空位的形成，从而降低氧化物的氧化能力。它们使氧化物在火星-范克列伦机制中效率较低。

6. 通过改变薄膜的厚度或掺杂剂类型，可以控制表面氧气空位的浓度。这允许精确控制氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，可能优化其在各种应用中的性能。
