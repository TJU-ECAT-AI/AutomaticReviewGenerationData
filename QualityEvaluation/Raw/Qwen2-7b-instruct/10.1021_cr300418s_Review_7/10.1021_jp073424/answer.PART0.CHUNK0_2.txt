[1] "The removal of one oxygen atom (out of 16 surface O atoms) from the surface to form 1/2O2 is exothermic."
[2] "The formation of an additional oxygen vacancy is endothermic and we denote this energy by ΔE."
[3] "The energy of oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of the doped (0001) VTF is endothermic and we denote it as ΔEd."

1. In the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, oxygen is supplied from the surface of the oxide in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. An exothermic ΔEv suggests that the surface is likely to have oxygen vacancies at thermodynamic equilibrium, enhancing the oxidizing power of the oxide.

2. The energy needed for creating the second oxygen vacancy at a distance of 11.36 Å from the first vacancy is denoted as ΔE. This energy characterizes the oxidative power of the oxide surface in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism.

3. The energy of oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of the doped (0001) VTF is endothermic, indicated as ΔEd. At reasonable oxygen pressure and temperature, without a reducing agent, the doped surface has a negligible number of vacancies. Dopants like Au, Ag, and Cu facilitate oxygen vacancy formation, leading to an increased oxidative power of the oxide surface compared to undoped VTF. Conversely, Al and Ga have the opposite effect, hindering oxygen vacancy formation.

1. 在Mars-van Krevelen机制中，氧化物催化氧化反应中氧气从氧化物表面提供。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。ΔEv为负值表明表面在热力学平衡时很可能含有氧空位，从而增强氧化物的氧化能力。

2. 创建距离第一个氧空位11.36 Å的第二个氧空位所需的能量被标记为ΔE。这个能量表征了氧化物表面在Mars-van Krevelen机制中的氧化性。

3. 镀层（0001）VTF表面的氧空位形成能量是吸热的，表示为ΔEd。在合理的氧气压力、温度下，没有还原剂的情况下，镀层表面具有很少的空位。Au、Ag、Cu等掺杂元素促进了氧空位的形成，相对于未掺杂VTF，这增加了氧化物表面的氧化能力。相反，Al和Ga有相反的效果，阻碍氧空位的形成。
