[6] "Starting from an r-TiO2(110) surface, we studied the effect of hydration by letting water dissociate in the Obr vacancies."
[7] "In the PES valence-band spectra corresponding to r- and h-TiO2(110) (Fig. 1D), the only obvious difference is the OH3s feature at a binding energy (BE) of 10.8 eV that is evident in the valence band after hy- dration."
[8] "However, O2 exposure at RT does not lead to the healing of all the Obr vacancies, even in the case of saturation."
[9] "In order to assign the Ti3d defect state, TiO2(110) surfaces need to be prepared that are characterized by perfect Obr rows without Obr vacancies and cap- ping H atoms, and by Ti troughs without Oot adatoms."

[18] "The above-presented results addressing the O2 interaction with r-TiO2(110) reveal that Ti charge donors exist in the near-surface region of vacuum-annealed TiO2 crystals, and that these donor sites strongly influence the O2 interaction with r-TiO2(110), even at temperatures as low as 120 K."
[19] "Because the gap state remains largely unaffected by the removal of all surface defects (Obr and OHbr), we propose that the appearance of the gap state on clean reduced TiO2(110) crys- tals, as is typically observed after vacuum anneal- ing, is mainly associated with the Ti interstitials."
[20] "Quenching of the gap state and so-called band- bending effects (Figs. 1D and 4F) can be ascribed to the withdrawal of electronic charge from the donor sites in the near-surface region through the accumulation of electronegative adsorbates, such as O2 and Oot adatoms on the surface."

The document describes a systematic exploration of the origin of the Ti3d defect state in the band gap of reduced titania (TiO2). It explains that the presence of oxygen vacancies (Obr) and hydroxyl groups (OHbr) does not significantly affect the gap state, suggesting that the defect state arises from surplus Ti atoms, most likely in interstitial sites near the surface. The study uses high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to propose that Ti interstitials in the near-surface region are largely responsible for the defect state. The research identifies a second oxygen dissociation channel within the Ti troughs in addition to the channel associated with Obr vacancies. The findings are supported by comprehensive DFT calculations. The document further discusses the role of Ti interstitials in surface redox chemistry and their influence on oxygen adsorption and dissociation processes. The gap state, which is typically observed after vacuum annealing, is attributed to the presence of Ti interstitials, and the document explains how the gap state can be quenched by removing surface defects and the accumulation of electronegative adsorbates.

文档描述了对减少二氧化钛（TiO2）中带隙的Ti3d缺陷状态起源的系统探索。它解释了氧空位（Obr）和羟基团（OHbr）的存在对间隙状态影响不大，表明缺陷状态来源于近表面区域过剩的Ti原子，最有可能是间隙原子。研究使用高分辨率扫描隧道显微镜（STM）、光电谱（PES）和密度泛函理论（DFT）计算来提出Ti间隙原子在近表面区域是导致缺陷状态的主要原因。研究还发现了Ti槽内额外的氧气解离通道，除了与Obr空位相关的通道。研究结果得到了全面的DFT计算的支持。文档进一步讨论了Ti间隙原子在表面氧化还原化学中的作用及其对氧气吸附和解离过程的影响。间隙状态通常在真空退火后出现，并且被归因于Ti间隙的存在，文档解释了如何通过去除表面缺陷和积累电子负性吸附剂来熄灭间隙状态。
