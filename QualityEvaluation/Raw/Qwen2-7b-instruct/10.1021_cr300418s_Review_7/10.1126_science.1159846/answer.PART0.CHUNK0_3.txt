[1] "We found that the gap state remains almost unchanged on surfaces where the Obr vacancies (or bridging OH groups) have been removed."
[2] "To explain this finding, we propose that the gap state mainly stems from surplus Ti atoms in the near-surface region, most likely on interstitial sites."
[3] "In addition to an O2 dissociation channel in Obr vacancies, we discovered a non-vacancy-related O2 dissociation channel that occurs within the Ti troughs."
[4] "We considered the PES results acquired with surface preparations identical to those in the STM experiments and focused on the OH3s feature at 10.8 eV and on the Ti3d defect state."
[5] "One observation from Fig. 2F is that for 4-L O2 exposure, where the TiO2(110) surface is characterized by perfect Obr rows and essentially without capping H atoms, the Ti3d defect state was only slightly attenuated."
[6] "Given the possibility of electron donation arising from Ti interstitial defects, we studied the interaction of O2 with the clean r-TiO2(110) surface at RT in further detail."
[7] "Specifically, we identified a second O2 dissociation channel that occurs within the Ti troughs in addition to the O2 dissociation channel in Obr vacancies."
[8] "The experimental observation in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, A and B, that dissociation of O2 in the Ti troughs leads to next-nearest neighbors of Oot adatoms is supported by the calculated preference for this configuration."

Answer: 
1. The gap state was found to remain nearly constant even after removing Obr vacancies or OH groups, suggesting it originates from Ti atoms in the near-surface region, particularly interstitial sites.

Answer: 
2. An additional O2 dissociation pathway was detected within the Ti troughs alongside the dissociation channel in Obr vacancies.

Answer: 
3. The observation that O2 dissociation in the Ti troughs resulted in the formation of next-nearest neighbor Oot adatoms was confirmed by computational models.

1. 我们发现，在移除桥接氧空位（或桥接OH基团）后的表面，能带间隙状态几乎保持不变。这表明该状态主要源自近表面区域过剩的钛原子，最有可能在间隙位置上。

2. 我们提出了一个解释：该能带间隙状态主要源于去除桥接氧空位（或桥接OH基团）后近表面区域过剩的钛原子，这些原子可能位于间隙位置。

3. 除了发生在桥接氧空位中的O2解离通道外，我们还发现了在Ti凹槽中发生的非空位相关O2解离通道。

4. 我们考虑了与扫描隧道显微镜实验中表面制备相同的PES结果，并集中分析了10.8 eV的OH3s特征和Ti3d缺陷状态。

5. 从图2F中可以看出，对于4升氧气暴露的TiO2(110)表面，其具有完美的桥接氧空位行且几乎无封顶H原子，Ti3d缺陷状态仅略有减弱。

6. 基于从Ti原子可能提供的电子捐赠的可能性，我们进一步研究了在室温下清洁的r-TiO2(110)表面与氧气的相互作用。

7. 特别是，我们识别出除了在桥接氧空位中的O2解离通道外，还存在在Ti凹槽中发生的第二个O2解离通道。

8. 计算模型证实了图3和图4A和B中观察到的O2在Ti凹槽中解离导致相邻Ti凹槽中形成最近邻Oot吸附物这一现象。
