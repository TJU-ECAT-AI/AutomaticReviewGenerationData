[1] "Titanium dioxide (TiO2), or titania, is used in a number of technological areas, including heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis,solar cells, gas sensors, waste remediation, and biocompatible materials."
[2] "Understanding the origin of the defect state is important for improving or expanding the scope of titania-based systems for specific applications."
[3] "For example, the enhanced catalytic activity of titania-supported gold nanoparticles is coupled to local properties at the interface between gold and reduced titania (14)."
[4] "This hypothesis was proposed more than three decades ago based on ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and low-energy electron-diffraction measurements on the TiO2(110)(1 × 1) surface (8), and has been generally accepted for years (5, 6, 9, 11)."
[5] "In the UPS studies, this proposed O-vacancy model has largely been based on experimental observations that the defect state can be eliminated by O2 exposure (8, 12, 13)."
[6] "By means of high-resolution STM and photo-electron spectroscopy (PES) measurements in conjunction with DFT calculations, we have systematically explored the origin of the Ti3d defect state in the band gap."
[7] "The gap state remains largely unaffected by the removal of all surface defects (Obr and OHbr), we propose that the appearance of the gap state on clean reduced TiO2(110) crystals, as is typically observed after vacuum annealing, is mainly associated with the Ti interstitials."
[8] "Relative to the initial configuration (Fig. 5B), the overall barrier for the formation of the TiOx islands on the terraces is 0.75 eV. However, with respect to the potential energy of the meta-stable intermediate configuration of the Ti inter-stitial between the first and second TiO2 trilayer (Fig. 5C), the barrier becomes 1.2 eV."
[9] "For instance, coadsorption of Oot in fig. S5, B to D, decreases the stability of molecularly adsorbed O2 by 0.4 eV (fig. S5, B versus E) but that of dissociatively adsorbed oxygen by 1.5 eV (fig. S5, C and D versus F and G)."
[10] "For a slab characterized by a Ti interstitial between the second and third TiO2 trilayer and a pristine surface, our calculations reveal the existence of a gap state. This state lies 2 eV above the VBM, in good agreement with the state observed in the PES experiments (Figs. 1D and 2E) as well as with DFT calculations addressing Ti interstitials in the bulk (32)."
