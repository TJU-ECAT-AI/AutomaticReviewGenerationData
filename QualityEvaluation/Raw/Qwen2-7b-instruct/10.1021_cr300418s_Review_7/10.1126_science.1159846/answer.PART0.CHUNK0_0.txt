[2] "Understanding the origin of the defect state is important for improving or expanding the scope of titania-based systems for specific applications."
[3] "In the UPS studies, this proposed O-vacancy model has largely been based on experimental observations that the defect state can be eliminated by O2 exposure."
[4] "We argue that these donor-specific sites play a key role in and may dictate the ensuing surface chemistry, such as providing the electronic charge required for O2 adsorption and dissociation."
[5] "By means of high-resolution STM and photo-electron spectroscopy (PES) measurements in conjunction with DFT calculations, we have systematically explored the origin of the Ti3d defect state in the band gap."
[6] "We found that the gap state remains almost unchanged on surfaces where the Obr vacancies (or bridging OH groups) have been removed."
[7] "The fact that the Ti3d defect state reappears after annealing to temperatures higher than 400 K can be explained by the migration of Ti interstitials from deeper layers to interstitial sites in the layers nearer the surface that had been depleted in the course of TiOx island formation."
[8] "To elucidate the mechanism of the second O2 dissociation channel identified experimentally in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, we performed additional calculations (figs. S4 and S5) (26)."

1. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is utilized in various technological sectors such as heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis, solar cells, gas sensors, waste remediation, and biocompatible materials.
2. Determining the origin of the defect state is crucial for enhancing or broadening the application scope of TiO2-based systems for specific purposes.
3. The O-vacancy model in UPS studies is largely based on the observation that the defect state disappears upon O2 exposure.
4. The Ti interstitials in the near-surface region are essential for surface chemistry, particularly for supplying the necessary electronic charge for O2 adsorption and dissociation.
5. Through high-resolution STM and PES measurements alongside DFT calculations, the origin of the Ti3d defect state in the band gap has been thoroughly investigated.
6. The gap state remains relatively stable even after removing Obr vacancies or bridging OH groups.
7. The re-emergence of the gap state after annealing at temperatures above 400 K is attributed to the migration of Ti interstitials from deeper layers to interstitial sites closer to the surface.
8. To understand the mechanism of the second O2 dissociation channel identified experimentally, additional calculations were conducted.
9. The function of Ti interstitials in O2 adsorption and dissociation processes is to supply the required electronic charge to the adsorbates.
