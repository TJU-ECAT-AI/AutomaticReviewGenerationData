1. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is utilized in various technological sectors like heterogeneous catalysis, photocatalysis, solar cells, gas sensors, waste cleanup, and biocompatible materials.

2. Traditionally, the Ti3d defect state within the band gap, situated 0.85 eV beneath the Fermi level, was attributed to bridging oxygen (Obr) vacancies due to the two extra electrons per Obr vacancy being transferred to neighboring Ti atoms.

3. Researchers conducted a systematic investigation of the origin of the Ti3d defect state in the band gap through high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

4. The study discovered that the gap state persisted unchanged on surfaces devoid of Obr vacancies (or bridging OH groups).

5. The O-vacancy model, largely grounded in UPS studies, posits that the defect state disappears upon oxygen exposure.

6. The assignment of the defect state on the h-TiO2(110) surface is complicated by the presence of capping H atoms, which might also produce a state within the band gap.

7. According to the proposed model, electronegative adsorbates on TiO2(110) surfaces with perfect Obr rows are stabilized through charge transfer from Ti interstitials to the adsorbates.

8. Considering the potential for electron donation from Ti interstitial defects, the team delved into the interaction of O2 with a pristine r-TiO2(110) surface at room temperature.

9. They uncovered a secondary O2 dissociation pathway within the Ti troughs alongside the dissociation channel in Obr vacancies.

10. The findings demonstrate the existence of Ti charge donors in the near-surface region of vacuum-annealed TiO2 crystals, significantly impacting the O2 interaction with r-TiO2(110) even at low temperatures (120 K).

11. Assuming the Ti diffusion process is a first-order reaction, a rough estimate of the diffusion barrier derived from the Redhead formula is 1.2 eV.

1. 钛酸盐（TiO2）被用于多种技术领域，包括异相催化、光催化、太阳能电池、气体传感器、废物处理和生物兼容材料。

2. 传统上，位于费米能级以下0.85 eV的带隙中的Ti3d缺陷状态被归因于桥接氧（Obr）空位，因为每个Obr空位可能转移两个额外的电子到相邻的Ti原子。

3. 研究人员通过高分辨率扫描隧道显微镜（STM）和光电谱（PES）结合密度泛函理论（DFT）计算系统地探索了带隙中Ti3d缺陷状态的起源。

4. 研究发现，在去除Obr空位（或桥接OH团）的表面上，间隙状态几乎保持不变。

5. UPS研究中的该O空位模型主要基于实验观察，即通过氧气暴露可以消除缺陷状态（8, 12, 13）。

6. 对于h-TiO2(110)表面，由于存在覆盖H原子，缺陷状态的分配受到阻碍，这些H原子也可能导致带隙内的状态。

7. 根据提出的模型，在具有完美Obr行的TiO2（110）表面上，通过从Ti空位向吸附剂转移电子，电负性吸附剂得以稳定。

8. 考虑到Ti空位缺陷可能的电子捐赠，团队深入研究了在室温下与干净的r-TiO2(110)表面的O2交互作用。

9. 他们发现了在Ti凹槽内发生的第二个O2分解通道，除了在Obr空位中的O2分解通道。

10. 这些发现表明，在真空退火的TiO2晶体的近表面区域存在Ti电荷供体，这些供体显著影响了r-TiO2(110)与O2的交互作用，即使在低温（120 K）也是如此。

11. 假设Ti扩散过程为一级反应，则从Redhead公式推导出的扩散壁垒的粗略估计为1.2 eV。
