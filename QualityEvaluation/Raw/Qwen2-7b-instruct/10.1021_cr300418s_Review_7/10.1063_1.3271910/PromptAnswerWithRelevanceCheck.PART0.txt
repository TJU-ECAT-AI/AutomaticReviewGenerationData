<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between oxygen vacancies and reactants, leading to the formation of reactive species. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the reactivity of the surface and thus improve catalytic performance and oxidation capability.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between the reactants and the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies play a pivotal role in this mechanism, as they provide active sites for the adsorption and oxidation of molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is critical because it influences the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values generally indicate higher reactivity and efficiency in the oxidation process.
