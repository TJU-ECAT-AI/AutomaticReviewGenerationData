The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between the reactants and the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies play a pivotal role in this mechanism, as they provide active sites for the adsorption and oxidation of molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is critical because it influences the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values generally indicate higher reactivity and efficiency in the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进反应物与氧化物催化剂表面之间的电子转移而发挥作用。氧空位在这一机制中起着至关重要的作用，因为它们为分子如一氧化碳（CO）的吸附和氧化提供了活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值通常意味着更高的反应性和效率。
