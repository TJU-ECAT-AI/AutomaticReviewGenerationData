The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant as it influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values typically lead to increased catalytic activity and oxidizing power.
