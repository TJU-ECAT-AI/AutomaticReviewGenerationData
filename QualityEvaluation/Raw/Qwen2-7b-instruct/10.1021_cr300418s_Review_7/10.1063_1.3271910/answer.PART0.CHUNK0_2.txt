The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons between oxygen vacancies and reactants, leading to the formation of reactive species. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the reactivity of the surface and thus improve catalytic performance and oxidation capability.
