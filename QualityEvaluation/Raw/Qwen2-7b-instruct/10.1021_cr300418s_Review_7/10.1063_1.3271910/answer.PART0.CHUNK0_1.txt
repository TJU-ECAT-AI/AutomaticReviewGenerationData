<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the transfer of electrons and oxygen vacancies. Oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it affects the reaction kinetics and the availability of active sites for the oxidation process.
