The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy is pivotal in enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By creating additional oxygen vacancies and stabilizing oxygen interstitials through La doping, the CO adsorption energy is increased, thus improving the efficiency of the oxidation reaction.
