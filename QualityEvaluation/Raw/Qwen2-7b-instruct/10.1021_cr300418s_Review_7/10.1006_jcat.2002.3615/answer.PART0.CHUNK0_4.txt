[1] "We also note that we are not treating questions relating to selectivity here."
[2] "In Fig. 2a we have included some points for N2 activation on Ru(0001) in the presence of high coverages of nitrogen or oxygen (18). They are merely shifted to (much) weaker bonding, but are still close to the BrnstedEvansPolanyi line."
[3] "It means that if the reaction conditions are changed such that the coverage of an intermediate changes significantly then adsorbate-adsorbate interactions may effectively shift the corresponding point to another position along the line."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. As ΔEv decreases, the surface becomes more active in promoting oxidation reactions due to the increased availability of oxygen atoms for the reaction. However, there is a trade-off, as a lower ΔEv can lead to stronger binding of oxygen, potentially hindering the efficiency of the oxidation process. The significance of ΔEv lies in its ability to modulate the balance between the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power, thus influencing the overall performance of the oxide catalyst in oxidation reactions.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有关键作用。随着ΔEv的降低，表面变得更加活跃，有利于促进氧化反应，因为增加了可用于反应的氧原子的数量。然而，存在权衡，较低的ΔEv可能导致氧的吸附力增强，可能阻碍氧化过程的效率。ΔEv的重要性在于其能够调节催化活性和氧化能力之间的平衡，从而影响氧化物催化剂在氧化反应中的整体性能。
