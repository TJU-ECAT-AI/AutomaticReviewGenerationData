[1] "It means that if the reaction conditions are changed such that the coverage of an intermediate changes significantly then adsorbate-adsorbate interactions may effectively shift the corresponding point to another position along the line."
[2] "In Fig. 2a we have included some points for N2 activation on Ru(0001) in the presence of high coverages of nitrogen or oxygen (18). They are merely shifted to (much) weaker bonding, but are still close to the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi line."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
Adsorbate-adsorbate interactions can significantly influence the catalytic activity and selectivity of a catalyst. When the coverage of an intermediate changes under altered reaction conditions, the adsorbate-adsorbate interactions may cause a shift in the corresponding point along the linear relationship depicted by the Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi line in Figure 2. This shift affects the strength of bonding, potentially leading to a change in the catalytic performance of the material.

吸附剂-吸附剂相互作用对催化剂的活性和选择性有显著影响。当改变反应条件导致中间体的覆盖度发生变化时，吸附剂-吸附剂相互作用可能会使图2中显示的Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi线上的对应点沿该线发生位移。这种位移会影响结合强度，可能进而改变材料的催化性能。

[1] "The important parameter characterizing the reactivity of a given metal is the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process."
[2] "This parameter has its optimum value for different metals depending on the nature of the reactants, and the variation in optimum catalyst from one reaction to the next follows directly from this principle."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
A key factor determining the reactivity of a specific metal catalyst is the adsorbate-surface interaction energy, E, in the final state of the dissociation process. This energy value varies optimally across different metals according to the characteristics of the reactants involved. As a result, the change in the best catalyst for each individual reaction directly correlates with this principle.

确定特定金属催化剂活性的关键因素是吸附剂表面在分解过程最终状态的能量交互值E。这一能量值在不同金属上根据反应物的特性而具有最优值。因此，从一种反应到另一种反应的最佳催化剂的变化直接遵循这一原理。
