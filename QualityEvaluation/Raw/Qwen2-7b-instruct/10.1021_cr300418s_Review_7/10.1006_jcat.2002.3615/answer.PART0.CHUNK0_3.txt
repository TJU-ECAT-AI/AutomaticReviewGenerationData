[1] "In the present communication we show that for a class of reactions proceeding over tran- sition metal catalyst surfaces, there is a universal, reaction- independent relationship between activation energies and the stability of important intermediates in the reaction."
[2] "On this basis we can understand semiquantitatively what it is that characterizes the optimum catalyst for all the reactions belonging to the class."
[3] "The reactions we will focus on here can be characterized as activation of a diatomic molecule."
[4] "For ammonia synthesis (N2 + 3H2 2NH3) is, for instance, activation of N2 in the sense that N2 is first dissociated, whereafter the dis- sociation products are hydrogenated into the final pro- duct."
[5] "Similarly, FischerTropsch synthesis (e.g., nCO + (2n + 1)H2 CnH2n+2 + nH2O) can be char- acterized as CO activation."
[6] "For this reason the N2 activation is the key aspect of the reaction."
[7] "Clearly, the step-type sites are most reactive."
[8] "When combined with a kinetic model for ammonia synthesis, the linear relationship between activation energy and nitrogensurface bond energy translates into a volcano-shaped dependence of the catalytic activity on the nitrogen adsorption energy."
[9] "If we assume that the overall kinetics of these reactions follows the same patterndissociation is rate limiting when the barrier is high and blocking of the surface is limiting the reactivity when the adsorbates bind strongly to the surfacethen the universality in Fig. 2 trans- lates into universality in terms of the volcano curves."
[10] "The important parameter characterizing the reactivity of a given metal is the adsorbate surface interaction energy, E,inthefinalstateofthedissociationprocess."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. High ΔEv signifies a strong interaction between the oxygen vacancies and the reacting species, enhancing the oxidizing ability. Conversely, lower ΔEv indicates a weaker interaction, potentially reducing the catalytic activity due to decreased surface reactivity. The mechanism relies on the creation of reactive oxygen vacancies that facilitate the oxidation process, with the energy barrier for oxygen vacancy formation dictating the efficiency and selectivity of the catalytic reaction.

火星-范克里夫机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧空位（ΔEv）的形成发挥作用。氧空位形成的能量需求对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。高ΔEv表明氧空位与反应物种之间存在强烈的相互作用，增强氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv表示较弱的相互作用，可能降低催化活性，因为表面反应性降低。该机制依赖于创建促进氧化过程的活性氧空位，而氧空位形成的能量壁垒决定了催化反应的效率和选择性。
