[1] "It means that if the reaction conditions are changed such that the coverage of an intermediate changes significantly then adsorbate-adsorbate interactions may effectively shift the corresponding point to another position along the line."
[2] "An example of such an effect may be provided by the recent work of Over et al. on CO oxidation over RuO2 (19)."
[3] "The universal relation between activation energy and binding energy directly suggests a general approach to optimizing the catalyst by searching for new materials with adsorbate-surface interaction strengths in the right range."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). These vacancies play a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By facilitating the adsorption and subsequent oxidation of reactants, the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) influences how efficiently the reaction proceeds. When the reaction conditions alter the coverage of intermediates, adsorbate-adsorbate interactions can shift the corresponding points along the energy line, affecting the reaction dynamics. An illustrative example of this phenomenon can be observed in CO oxidation over RuO2, as demonstrated by the work of Over et al. (19). This mechanism highlights the importance of ΔEv in optimizing catalysts and enhancing their performance in oxidation reactions.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过形成氧空位（ΔEv）发挥作用。这些空位在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。通过促进反应物的吸附和随后的氧化，氧空位形成的能量需求（ΔEv）影响反应的效率。当反应条件改变中间体的覆盖度时，吸附剂-吸附剂相互作用可以沿着能量线移动相应的点，从而影响反应动力学。Over等人（19）的工作为RuO2上的CO氧化提供了一个典型的例子，展示了这种机制。这一机制强调了在优化催化剂和提高其在氧化反应中的性能方面的ΔEv的重要性。
