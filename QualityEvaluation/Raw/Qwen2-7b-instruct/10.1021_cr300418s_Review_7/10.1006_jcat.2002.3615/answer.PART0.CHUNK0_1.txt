[1] "The existence of a universal BrnstedEvansPolanyi curve for the class of molecules considered here has an interesting consequence. If we assume that the overall kinetics of these reactions follows the same pattern—dissociation is rate-limiting when the barrier is high and blocking of the surface is limiting the reactivity when the adsorbates bind strongly to the surface—then the universality in Fig. 2 translates into universality in terms of the volcano curves."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by determining the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the surface can readily form oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. Conversely, a higher ΔEv reduces the surface's capacity to form oxygen vacancies, potentially decreasing both its catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过确定氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来运作。这种能量影响氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当ΔEv较低时，表面可以容易地形成氧空位，从而增强催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较高的ΔEv减少了表面形成氧空位的能力，可能降低其催化效率和氧化能力。
