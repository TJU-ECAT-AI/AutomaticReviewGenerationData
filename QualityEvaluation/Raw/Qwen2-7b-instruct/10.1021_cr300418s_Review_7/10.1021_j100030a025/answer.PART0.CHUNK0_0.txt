[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O_v) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
[2] "The formation of an oxygen vacancy involves the separation of an oxygen atom from the lattice, creating a hole that can act as an active site for chemical reactions. This process is energetically favorable due to the release of energy associated with the vacancy formation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the creation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for this formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies form by removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, which creates an active site for chemical reactions and is energetically favorable due to the released energy.

火星-范克瑞伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中，通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位（O_v）来操作。氧空位的形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有着决定性作用。氧空位通过从晶格中移除一个氧原子形成，从而产生化学反应的活性位点，并且由于释放的能量而具有能量优势。
