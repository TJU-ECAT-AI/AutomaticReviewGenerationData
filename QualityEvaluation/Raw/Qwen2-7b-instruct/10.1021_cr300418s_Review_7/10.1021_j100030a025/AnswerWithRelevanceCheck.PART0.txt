          [1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O_v) on the surface of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
          [2] "The formation of an oxygen vacancy involves the separation of an oxygen atom from the lattice, creating a hole that can act as an active site for chemical reactions. This process is energetically favorable due to the release of energy associated with the vacancy formation."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for this formation (ΔEv) is critical in determining both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capability of the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies form by removing an oxygen atom from the lattice, which creates an active site for chemical reactions and is energetically advantageous due to the released energy.

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The significance of the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) lies in its role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can facilitate more efficient surface reactions, leading to higher catalytic activity and oxidizing power. The mechanism typically involves the following steps:
          - Adsorption of reactant molecules onto the oxide surface.
          - Formation of an oxygen vacancy, releasing an oxygen atom to the surface.
          - Reaction of the oxygen atom with the adsorbed reactant, leading to oxidation.
          - Migration of the product away from the surface.
          
          The ΔEv determines the thermodynamic stability of the oxygen vacancy, affecting its formation and thus influencing the reaction rates and selectivities. A lower ΔEv suggests that the oxygen vacancy is more stable and can be formed more easily, enhancing the catalytic performance of the oxide surface.

          火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物表面的氧空位形成和利用来操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。较低的ΔEv意味着氧空位更容易形成，从而促进更高效的表面反应，导致更高的催化活性和氧化能力。该机制通常包括以下步骤：
          - 将反应物分子吸附到氧化物表面上。
          - 形成氧空位，释放出表面的氧原子。
          - 表面吸附的反应物与释放的氧原子反应，导致氧化。
          - 产品从表面迁移。
          
          ΔEv决定了氧空位的热力学稳定性，影响其形成并进而影响反应速率和选择性。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位更加稳定，可以更容易地形成，从而增强氧化物表面的催化性能。

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the surface is more active in promoting oxidation reactions due to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which facilitates the transfer of electrons and the activation of reactants. Conversely, a higher ΔEv indicates a less active surface, as the formation of oxygen vacancies becomes more energetically demanding, thus hindering the catalytic efficiency of the oxide.
