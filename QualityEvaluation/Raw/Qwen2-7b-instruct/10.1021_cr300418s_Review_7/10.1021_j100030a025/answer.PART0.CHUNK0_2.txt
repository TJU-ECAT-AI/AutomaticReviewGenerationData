[1] "In the context of catalysis, the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by the formation of an intermediate species on the catalyst surface that facilitates the oxidation of a reactant. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the creation of an intermediate species on the catalyst surface, which assists in the oxidation of reactants. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in assessing both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface.
