The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the surface is more active in promoting oxidation reactions due to the ease of oxygen vacancy formation, which facilitates the transfer of electrons and the activation of reactants. Conversely, a higher ΔEv indicates a less active surface, as the formation of oxygen vacancies becomes more energetically demanding, thus hindering the catalytic efficiency of the oxide.

火星-范克瑞伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当ΔEv较低时，表面更有利于促进氧化反应，因为形成氧空位更为容易，这促进了电子转移和反应物的活化。相反，较高的ΔEv表明表面活性较低，因为形成氧空位变得更加耗能，从而阻碍了氧化物的催化效率。
