With increasing interest in new catalytic materials based on doping of cerium dioxide with other metal
cations, it is necessary to have an atomic level understanding of the factors that impact on the structural
and electronic properties of doped ceria as well as its reactivity. We present in this paper simulations of
the ceria (111) and (110) surfaces doped with divalent cations Pd and Ni using density functional theory
(DFT) corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U) and hybrid DFT (using the screened
exchange HSE06 functional). Structural distortions due to doping are strong in both surfaces and the
most stable structure for both dopants arises through compensation of the dopant +2 valence through
oxygen vacancy formation. Both dopants also lower the formation energy of the active oxygen vacancy
in each surface, conﬁrming the potential for these dopants to be used in ceria based materials for
catalysis or solid oxide fuel cells, where the oxygen vacancy formation energy is important. When
comparing DFT + U and hybrid DFT, although the qualitative descriptions provided by both DFT
approaches are similar, we do ﬁnd that the energetics of oxygen vacancy formation are quantitatively
different and the importance of this point is discussed.

Introduction
Ceria is widely used in catalysis due to its so-called oxygen
storage capability, OSC.1–3 This is the ability of ceria to store and
release oxygen depending on the reaction conditions, i.e. under
oxygen poor conditions, oxygen is released and under oxygen
rich conditions, oxygen is taken up, leading to reoxidation of
ceria. Oxygen vacancy formation is connected with the change in
oxidation state of cerium from oxidised Ce4+ to reduced Ce3+.4–6
The reduction of CeO2 and formation of oxygen vacancies
have been well characterised over recent years by both experi-
ment6–9 and ﬁrst principles simulations.10–17 The release and
uptake of oxygen by ceria allow it to participate in redox reac-
tions, such as CO oxidation to CO2
18–21 and NOx reduction.22–24
The former reaction is favourable if formation of oxygen
vacancies is facilitated,18,25,26 e.g. on nanorods that expose the
(110) surface,25,26 but is slow on structures such as nanoparticles
that expose surfaces with a higher oxygen vacancy formation
energy, namely (111).25,26 For NOx reduction, the presence of
oxygen vacancies is necessary27 and these are healed by reduction
of the NOx species, while vacancy healing by adsorption of
oxygen containing species is a favourable process.28–30
Over recent years a great deal of work has been devoted to
examining how the reactivity of ceria can be improved.31–45 With
the example of CO oxidation, it is now understood that
enhancing oxygen vacancy formation is important—if this
formation energy can be made smaller, then the oxidative power
of ceria will be improved45 and there are a number of theoretical
studies elaborating upon this idea, as well as experiments con-
ﬁrming this concept.31–45 Examples of dopants include Zr,31 La,32
Pd,33,34 Ti35 and Cu.36
In parallel with the experiment, ﬁrst principles simulations
have been extensively used to study the atomic level properties of
bulk ceria and the low index (111), (110) and (100) surfaces, both
undoped13–17 and doped.41–45 These studies have predominantly
used density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site
Coulomb interactions (DFT + U). This approach describes quite
well the reduction of ceria by oxygen vacancy formation, alle-
viating the well known problem with approximate DFT
exchange correlation functionals, whereby the electrons are
delocalised over all Ce ions of the structure rather than localizing
on two Ce ions which are reduced to Ce3+.10–17
Dopants that have been studied with modelling include
Au,41,42 Zr,31 Ti,43 La,44 Pt,45 Pd46,47 and Ni.48 Most studies focus
on substituting the dopant for a Ce ion, usually in bulk, and
computing the oxygen vacancy formation energy, making
comparison with the formation energy in undoped ceria.
However, one must be cognisant of issues associated with the
electronic structure of the dopant compared with Ce4+ in the host
oxide. For a 3+ dopant such as La charge compensation must be
considered, whereby the lower valent dopant is compensated by
one oxygen vacancy for every two dopants, as is the case for
yttrium stabilised zirconia (YSZ). For a series of trivalent cations

doped into the CeO2 (110) surface, it has been shown that charge
compensation should be expected.49
Divalent
dopants can
also be
charge compensated
by
formation of a single oxygen vacancy. For the example of Pd
and Pt doping of bulk CeO2,46 Hermansson et al. claimed that
doping with Pd and Pt leads to a reduction in the formation
energy of the ﬁrst oxygen vacancy, which is facilitated by the
dopant having empty states that are ﬁlled upon vacancy
formation.46 However, Scanlon et al.47 showed that in fact these
particular dopants are more stable in their 2+ oxidation state in
bulk ceria and undergo compensation of their 2+ oxidation
state through spontaneous formation of an oxygen vacancy.
Therefore, the active oxygen vacancy is in fact the second
oxygen vacancy, which nonetheless has a lower energy cost than
in the undoped bulk. However, for these dopants such infor-
mation is lacking for ceria surfaces, which is crucial for its
applications in catalysis.
In a related recent work, Hu et al.50 have studied the CeO2
(111) surface, and La2O3 (001) and CaO (001) surfaces doped
with lower valent dopants and have also found that formation of
oxygen vacancies is enhanced compared to the undoped surface.
It is clear that substitutional doping of a cation in the original
oxide with a lower valent cation dopant will make formation of
oxygen vacancies more favourable.
Thus, it is not sufﬁcient to simply substitute a dopant for Ce
and compute the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Charge
compensating defects need to be considered when doping with
aliovalent cations.
A further point to be considered is the DFT approach used.
As discussed above, DFT + U is widely used for studying doped
ceria. While DFT + U has been extremely useful, it suffers from
a number of issues, including the dependence of material
parameters such as band gap, lattice constant, etc. on the value
of U. Oxygen vacancy formation energies depend on U16,17,51
and while the DFT + U setups used in this ﬁeld are quite robust,
this issue still persists. As an example, Huang and Fabris
showed that to obtain energies for CO adsorption at ceria
surfaces that are consistent with the experiment, U ¼ 2 eV must
be used.21 However, to consistently describe the electronic
structure of ceria, U in the range of 4.5–6 eV12,13,16,17,51,52 is
needed. A further example that highlights the sensitive balance
between metal oxidation states and geometry is the work of
Branda et al.53 in which a range of DFT + U setups and hybrid
DFT were used to study the adsorption of the Au atom on the
CeO2 (111) surface. There, changes to the exchange-correlation
functional were found to lead to very different adsorption
properties. Thus, no single value of U can be expected to
determine all properties to the same accuracy.51 This is partic-
ularly
important
for
energies,
including
oxygen
vacancy
formation energies, vacancy migration energies or adsorption
energies of molecules for which there remains doubt as to the
reliability of DFT + U energies.
Recently, hybrid DFT in the guise of the screened exchange
Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional54,55 has been imple-
mented in a plane wave basis set and used to study oxygen
vacancy formation in ceria surfaces and nanocrystals.15,17,51,52
Hybrid DFT offers a number of advantages over DFT + U in
that the correction to standard DFT is applied to all species and
all angular momenta in the system, whereas DFT + U applies the
Hubbard U to speciﬁed species and angular momenta. Screened
exchange hybrid DFT does have two parameters: the exact
exchange contribution and the screening length. Material prop-
erties will depend on the precise values of these parameters.
However, the 25% exact exchange contribution is generally
suitable for oxides, in particular for CeO2. The screening length
of 0.2 
A1 that we used is also used for other materials. Thus we
ﬁx both of these parameters, see ref. 54 and 55. However, one
must be aware that the ideal values of these parameters may be
quite different, depending on the oxide. For example, in
magnetic oxides such as NiO, an exact exchange contribution of
35% is more appropriate.56
Recent results on oxygen vacancies in ceria allow comparison
of DFT + U and hybrid DFT and indicate that while the
formation of reduced Ce3+ and the relative energies of oxygen
vacancy formation in various ceria structures are qualitatively
correctly described with DFT + U,15,17,51,52 there can be notable
differences between the oxygen vacancy formation energies
computed with DFT + U and hybrid DFT. This is not solely
conﬁned to ceria. For example, ref. 57 shows that oxygen
vacancies in trivalent dopant TiO2 are signiﬁcantly more stabi-
lised with hybrid DFT than with DFT + U.
Thus, this paper presents a DFT + U and hybrid DFT study of
divalent dopants, Pd and Ni, doped into the (111) and (110)
surfaces of ceria. The (111) and (110) surfaces are the two most
studied surfaces13–17,58,59 and present extremes of reactivity—
structures exposing the (111) surface tend to be much less reac-
tive than structures exposing the (110) surface.25,26,60,61 Recent
experimental work has focused on ceria nanostructures that
predominantly expose a particular surface, e.g. (111) on nano-
particles or (110) on nanorods. This has allowed effects due to
the surface structure to be unravelled. While it is the most
unreactive ceria surface, earlier work has shown that the (111)
surface can be made more favourable for oxygen vacancy
formation by doping.62 The effect of the surface structure on
charge compensation and reactivity of Pd and Ni doped ceria is
the ﬁrst question addressed by this paper.
Regarding the dopants, Pd has been doped into ceria63–65 and
its incorporation has been shown to be beneﬁcial for methane
combustion63 and allows higher rates of NO and N2O reduc-
tion.64 In addition, higher rates of oxidation of CO have been
reported.65 Ni has also been doped into ceria,66–69 and, similarly
to Pd, has been shown to improve oxidation reactions, princi-
pally CO oxidation, as well as to improve oxygen buffering.
The second important question is assessing the applicability of
DFT + U to describe doped ceria, and in particular the energetics
of oxygen vacancy formation. To investigate this we apply DFT
+ U and hybrid DFT to Pd and Ni doping of the (111) surface.
We ﬁnd that with both DFT approaches, the dopants substitute
on a Ce site, with a 2+ oxidation state, and a compensating
oxygen vacancy spontaneously forms. On the (110) surface, we
use only DFT + U and the results are similar to the (111) surface.
On both doped surfaces, the formation energy of the active
oxygen vacancy is lowered compared to the undoped surfaces,
showing that Pd and Ni doping enhances oxygen vacancy
formation in ceria surface. While DFT + U and hybrid DFT give
similar
qualitative
results,
the
quantitative
energetics
are
different and this is a question that requires further study to fully
understand.

Methodology
To describe the ceria (111) and (110) surfaces, we use a three
dimensional periodic slab model and a plane wave basis set to
describe the valence electronic wave functions within the VASP
code.70 The cut-off for the kinetic energy is 396 eV. For the core–
valence interaction we apply Bl€
ochl’s projector augmented wave
(PAW) approach.71 Ce is described with the 12 valence electron
potential and O with a [He] core. The dopants, Pd and Ni, are
described with 10 valence electrons.
We use the Perdew–Wang91 approximation to the exchange-
correlation functional;72 we discuss below how we go beyond this
approximation. The VASP PAW potential code does not
support exact exchange at present. Therefore, the standard DFT
PAW potentials are used in this paper, for the PW91 exchange-
correlation functional. We ﬁrst run a single point DFT-PW91 +
U calculation to obtain a wavefunction and then use this as an
input to the HSE06 calculation. Within the HSE06 calculation,
the core–valence interaction is re-evaluated at the HSE06 level.
k-point sampling is performed using the Monkhorst–Pack
scheme, with sampling grids of (2  2  1), and G-point
sampling, depending on the surface supercell expansion used.
Ceria is generally considered to be an ionic oxide. Thus, the
(111) surface is a type II surface according to the Tasker classi-
ﬁcation73 and is made up of neutral O–Ce–O trilayers along the
slab with no dipole moment present upon cleaving. The (110)
surface is a type I surface, with neutral CeO2 planes in each
surface layer. For the (111) surface (2  2) and (4  4) surface
supercell expansions are employed, while for the (110) surface,
a (2  2) surface expansion is employed. For the (111) surface,
the slab is 4 O–Ce–O trilayers thick (12 atomic layers), while the
(110) surface slab is 7 layers thick; for all surfaces the vacuum gap
is 12 
A; these have been determined in earlier studies.10,13 The
energy and force convergence criteria are 0.0001 eV and 0.02 eV

A1, respectively.
The smaller (111) surface slab has 16 Ce ions, with 4 Ce ions in
the surface layer, giving an overall dopant concentration of 6%
and a dopant concentration of 25% in the outermost Ce layer,
but it allows for periodic plane wave hybrid DFT calculations to
be carried out. The larger (111) surface supercell has 64 Ce ions,
with 16 Ce ions in the surface layer, giving an overall dopant
concentration of 1.6% and a concentration of 6% in the outer-
most Ce layer. The (110) surface has 28 Ce ions, with 4 Ce in each
CeO2 layer, giving an overall dopant concentration of 3.6% and
a surface dopant concentration of 25%.
Since ceria is easily reducible, both oxidised and reduced Ce
must be treated consistently. This requires an approach beyond
the approximate exchange correlation functionals popularly
used, which have been demonstrated to provide an inconsistent
description of the oxygen vacancy in ceria.12,13,50 Given the size of
the systems studied, with up to 200 atoms, we apply the DFT + U
approach for all systems74,75 and hybrid DFT for the smaller
(111) surface supercell.
DFT + U adds a Hubbard U correction to the standard DFT
energy to consistently describe the localised reduced Ce3+ states.
The use of DFT + U to describe reduced Ce3+ is documented in
a number of papers.10–17,20–23,42–49 In our work, the U parameter is
5 eV on Ce,12,13 which is in the commonly used range of U values
of 4.5–6 eV. In the remainder of this paper, we will denote this
approach as DFT-PW91 + U to signify that the +U correction is
in addition to the standard PW91 exchange-correlation func-
tional. The computed bulk lattice constant with DFT-PW91 + U
is 5.450 
A.
Hybrid DFT adds a portion of exact Hartree–Fock exchange
to the local DFT energy, which helps us to partially correct the
self-interaction problem present in approximate DFT exchange-
correlation functionals. 25% exact exchange is applied and this is
a universal parameter. The screened exchange functional of
Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) is used,54,55 with a screening
length of 0.2 
A1. Due to the large computational expense of
hybrid DFT calculations in a plane wave basis set, we limit
hybrid DFT to the (2  2) surface supercell expansion of the
(111) surface, providing a check on the performance of DFT-
PW91 + U.17,50,51,76,77 The computed bulk lattice constant with
hybrid DFT is 5.397 
A, in good agreement with the experiment.
We have also determined surface energies of the (111) and
(110) surfaces with DFT + U and HSE06. We have computed the
surface energies of the (111) and (110) surfaces with DFT + U
and HSE06. These are given in Table 1 and compared with our
earlier DFT (PW91) results (ref. 13).
The data show that the surface stabilities are the same with all
methods. The absolute values obtained are quite sensitive to the
precise exchange correlation functional used, which is well
known in DFT calculations, e.g. ref. 13.

determined from surface energies, while the (110) surface is the
next most stable. The (110) surface has the lowest oxygen
vacancy formation energy of the two surfaces considered,
making it the most reactive.

on the smaller (2  2) surface supercell with DFT-PW91 + U and
HSE06.
In Fig. 2 we show the structure of Pd substituted onto a Ce site
in the (111) surface from DFT-PW91 + U and HSE06. Both
methods give similar structures after doping. The Ce coordina-
tion environment in the (111) surface, in which the cation is
surrounded by 7 anions, is not favourable for Pd, which prefers
a 4 coordinate square planar coordination environment. There-
fore, upon relaxation, Pd distorts the local structure. Through
this distortion, Pd is bonded to two surface oxygen atoms and
two third layer oxygen atoms. The distortion involves the
displacement of Pd away from the remaining two surface oxygen
atoms and oxygen in the fourth atomic layer. The Pd–O distances
given in Table 2 are consistent with a four-fold coordinated Pd
ion and are similar for both DFT approaches. The consistent
description of Pd doping with DFT-PW91 + U and HSE06 is
encouraging.
In the (111) surface, the distortion around the dopant occurs
naturally and we have found no solution that is symmetric and
undistorted, with a 7-fold Pd coordination environment. In bulk
ceria, by contrast, both coordination environments are stable for
Pd, with the dopant preferring a distorted square planar
environment.47
With Ni doping, there are also distortions to the structure
around the dopant site, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3. Ni
appears to take a coordination environment in which it has four
Ni–O bonds with the bonds to two surface oxygen atoms and the
oxygen in the fourth layer longer than these Ni–O bonds.
Inspection of the local structure around Ni leads us to conclude
that it takes a square planar four coordinate bonding environ-
ment. We ﬁnd this structure for both DFT approaches.
This may seem surprising at ﬁrst, since in its oxide, NiO, Ni is
in a 6-coordinate, octahedral environment. However, the ﬂuorite
structure for CeO2 does not facilitate this coordination envi-
ronment for Ni. We have allowed relaxations from a number of
starting undistorted and distorted geometries, and have found
only 4 coordinate Ni to be stable. However, square planar 4
coordinate nickel is well known in inorganic complexes, for
example, NiCl2 (dppe) and [Ni(CN)4]2, and in these complexes
Ni is diamagnetic. In the present simulations, we ﬁnd that the Ni
cation is also diamagnetic when doped into ceria surfaces.
The geometry data for both dopants incorporated into the
(111) ceria surface show that the DFT-PW91 + U and hybrid
DFT structures and geometries for both dopants are similar,
giving conﬁdence in using DFT-PW91 + U for calculations on
larger structures.
Finally, for the (111) surface, we have also examined a larger
(4  4) expansion of the surface which has a dopant concentra-
tion of 6.25% in the surface. Due to the size of this surface model,
only DFT-PW91 + U calculations were possible, but the results

for the (2  2) surface expansion indicate that DFT-PW91 + U
and HSE06 provide similar structures for each dopant, so that
DFT-PW91 + U will be reliable. For both Pd and Ni doping, the
dopants are found in the same coordination environment as the
(2  2) surface supercell. Further investigations are conﬁned to
the smaller (111) surface supercell.
In Fig. 4 we show the atomic structure of the most stable
substitutional site for Ni and Pd doped into the CeO2 (110)
surface from DFT-PW91 + U. The dopants induce different
distortions in the local structure. Pd breaks the bonding to
subsurface oxygen atoms, maintaining coordination to the four
surface oxygen atoms, with the Pd–O distances given in Table 4.
Ni distorts the local atomic structure by breaking the bonds to
two of the outermost surface oxygen atoms and taking a four
coordinate bonding environment that is similar to that found in
the (111) surface.
3.3
Formation of charge compensating oxygen vacancies
Since the dopants have a 2+ oxidation state, the primary charge
compensation mechanism is one oxygen vacancy per dopant. To
examine the stability of compensating oxygen vacancies, we
compute the energy required for formation of an oxygen vacancy
in the doped surface from
E (O vac) ¼ {E (MCeO2x) + 1/2E (O2)}  E (MCeO2),
(1)
where E (MCeO2–x) is the total energy of the doped CeO2 surface
with dopant M and an oxygen vacancy, E (MCeO2) is the total
energy of the doped CeO2 surface with dopant M and we refer-
ence to half the energy of an O2 molecule.
If the vacancy formation energy is negative then an oxygen
vacancy forms spontaneously to compensate the dopant. In bulk
CeO2, oxygen vacancy compensation was predicted to be spon-
taneous in ref. 47, but in ref. 46, the oxygen vacancy formation
energy was small and positive. For Ni doping of bulk CeO2
compensating oxygen vacancies have also been predicted to form
under most conditions of temperature and pressure.48 However,
these results are for bulk doped ceria and similar investigations
for ceria surfaces, which are of great importance for real catalytic
systems and can show properties dependent on the surface
structure, are lacking. In addition, the previous calculations use
some ﬂavour of DFT + U, but the reliability of the DFT + U
energies, which are U dependent, is as yet not known.
In Fig. 5(a) we show a generic image of the doped (111) surface
with the (2  2) surface expansion with the dopant indicated as
the grey sphere and the oxygen vacancy sites considered are
numbered I and II. Fig. 5(b) shows the dopant and vacancy sites,
with the latter numbered I–III, for the doped (110) surface. Table
5 presents oxygen vacancy formation energies for these oxygen
sites.
We ﬁnd that Ni and Pd doping of both ceria surfaces is
spontaneously compensated by formation of an oxygen vacancy,
as indicated by the negative oxygen vacancy formation energies
highlighted in Table 5.
For Pd and Ni, the energy gain in the (111) surface is close to 1
eV with DFT-PW91 + U, and 2.21 eV (Pd) and 2.77 eV (Ni) with
HSE06. In the (110) surface, two of the oxygen vacancy sites
shown are equivalent—as indicated by the formation energies in
Table 5 and the most stable oxygen vacancy site has an energy
gain of 1.2 eV for Pd and 0.24 eV for Ni.
The key ﬁnding is that spontaneous compensation of Pd and
Ni doping by oxygen vacancy formation is found in ceria
surfaces with both DFT approaches. Thus, the DFT + U
approach can be used to study, at least qualitatively, the prop-
erties of these doped systems.
However, while the DFT + U and HSE06 descriptions of
doping and formation of compensating oxygen vacancies are

consistent, it is important to point out that DFT + U and HSE06
give different energies for the oxygen vacancy formation energy,
with formation of a compensating oxygen vacancy formation
notably more stabilised with HSE06 compared to the present
DFT + U setup.
Given the dependence of oxygen vacancy formation energies
on the value of U, we have investigated at what value of U,
applied to the Ce 4f states, the energies of oxygen vacancy
compensation from DFT + U will be in best agreement with the
HSE energies. We ﬁnd that with U ¼ 10 eV the best agreement in
the oxygen vacancy formation energies is obtained. However, we
must point out that one must recognise that there are issues with
this procedure. Mainly that with such large values of U the
description of other properties is badly affected, e.g. with U > 7
eV, Ce3+ states lie in the valence band of ceria,11 rather than in the
band gap, so that the description of the oxygen vacancy will be
wrong, which will inﬂuence the computed energetics.
This does highlight the primary issue with the DFT + U
approach, namely that a single value of U is unable to describe all
properties to the same level of accuracy and therefore having
results from hybrid DFT, or similar, is important to assess the
reliability of DFT + U results. While a detailed analysis of this
important point is outside the scope of this paper, we do make
some remarks on differences between DFT + U and HSE for
formation of compensating oxygen vacancies. The ﬁrst is that
this ﬁnding could be general, with work on trivalent doped TiO2
also showing that HSE06 signiﬁcantly stabilises the compen-
sating oxygen vacancy compared to DFT + U.57 For formation
of oxygen vacancies in undoped ceria surfaces and nanocrystals,
recent work indicates notable differences between HSE06 and
DFT + U, in the range of 0.3–0.8 eV.15,16,77
Since hybrid DFT gives a better description of the binding
energy of O2, oxygen vacancy formation energies computed with
HSE06 should be accurate and we brieﬂy discuss the impact of
this on the oxygen vacancy formation energies. The error in the
O2 binding energy with the DFT + U setup used in this paper is
0.7 eV per oxygen, with O2 too strongly bound. This error
favours oxygen vacancy formation energy, so that the DFT + U
vacancy formation energies are too small by 0.7 eV. To date, this
has not been so crucial, as comparisons of oxygen vacancy
formation in different structures have been the focus of work,
and the error simply shifts formation energies by the size of the
error, not changing any trends.
Adding this error to the computed oxygen vacancy formation
energies with DFT + U has the following effect on the oxygen
vacancy compensation energy: the DFT + U energies will be less
negative, and so will have a larger deviation from the hybrid
DFT number (Table 5), but will not change the main conclu-
sions. A further possible effect arises from the lattice constants
that are obtained with DFT-PW91/DFT-PW91 + U, which can
lead to a reduced oxygen vacancy formation energy. However,
the effect of this will be expected to be smaller than the difference
between the DFT + U and hybrid DFT formation energies.
Nonetheless, it is a topic that requires further investigation and
while beyond the scope of the present paper, it will be of great
interest.

Formation of active oxygen vacancies
Having established that an oxygen vacancy forms to compensate
the 2+ oxidation states of the dopant in the (111) and (110)
surfaces, we now consider the formation of an active oxygen
vacancy. This is oxygen that is active in oxidation reactions via
the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. We select a number of
oxygen sites in the (111) and (110) surfaces with an existing
charge compensating oxygen vacancy, remove a second oxygen
atom and compute the formation energy of this oxygen vacancy
from
E (2O vac) ¼ E (MCeO2y)  {E (MCeO2x) + 1/2E (O2)}, (2)
where E (MCeO2–v) is the total energy of the doped CeO2 surface
with dopant M and two oxygen vacancies, E (MCeO2–x) is the
total energy of the doped CeO2 surface with dopant M incor-
porated and one oxygen vacancy and we reference to half the
energy of an O2 molecule. The different oxygen vacancy sites are
shown in Fig. 8. Table 6 gives the formation energies of the active
oxygen vacancies in the (111) and (110) surfaces.
The formation energy of the most stable active oxygen vacancy
is substantially reduced compared to the corresponding undoped
surface. For Pd in the (111) surface, a formation energy of only
+1.32 eV is computed, while for the Pd doped (110) surface, the
formation energy is +1.36 eV. Similarly, Ni doping leads to
signiﬁcant reductions in the formation energy of the active
oxygen vacancy. By comparison, the DFT-PW91 + U computed
oxygen vacancy formation energies are 2.6 eV on the undoped
(111) surface and 1.99 eV on the (110) surface.14 For formation of
active oxygen vacancies, we and others have found that the
present DFT + U setup will stabilise oxygen vacancy formation
over hybrid DFT by 0.7 eV, so that the energies in Table 6 are too
small by this amount. Comparison with our work, ref. 51, and
that of others, ref. 15, suggests that the inclusion of the error in
the O2 binding energy to the DFT + U results will, in fact, depend
on the surface involved—making the DFT + U and HSE06
energies quite close on (111) (using energies in ref. 15) or making
the DFT + U energies larger by around 0.4 eV on (110) (energies
from ref. 52). The same could apply to the energies in Table 6;
however, it does appear that simply improving the description of
O2 binding energy with hybrid DFT is by itself not enough to
understand the differences between DFT + U and hybrid DFT
and this difference is more complex. A deeper analysis of the
DFT + U energies will be required, but this is beyond the scope of
the present paper.
The origin of this dramatic reduction in the oxygen vacancy
formation energy is quite simple. For both dopants, the most
stable active oxygen vacancy site is an oxygen on the surface
that is not coordinated to the dopant, i.e. site I in both surfaces
shown in Fig. 8. Further, this oxygen is coordinated to two Ce
atoms, so it should be easier to remove. Removal of an oxygen
directly bonded to the dopant is much less favourable since that
would destroy the square planar coordination environment of
the dopant; an example of this is site III in the (111) surface
and site II in the (100) surface, both of which have oxygen
vacancy formation energies that are larger than in the undoped
surface.
The atomic structures of the most stable active oxygen vacancy
structures are shown for each dopant in Fig. 9 for the (111)
surface and in Fig. 10 for the (110) surface. In both CeO2
surfaces, Pd and Ni retain their preferred square planar coordi-
nation environment upon formation of the most stable active
oxygen vacancy and the major changes are in the subsurface Ce
ions, which are displaced off their lattice sites, consistent with
formation of reduced Ce3+.11,14–16
The spin density (which allows visualisation of the destination
of the two electrons released by formation of an active oxygen
vacancy) and projected electronic density of states (PEDOS) are
shown in Fig. 11 for the example of the Pd doped (111) and (110)
surfaces. The spin density shows that two reduced Ce3+ ions are

formed after removal of the active oxygen vacancy. We present
the solution in which the two Ce3+ ions have the same spin, i.e.
are ferromagnetically (FM) coupled. However, work on oxygen
vacancies in ceria has indicated that the FM and spin paired
antiferromagnetic (AFM) solutions are generally separated by
very small energy differences. Thus for the case of a small
number of oxygen vacancies, producing a small number of Ce3+
ions in a host of Ce4+ ions, this distinction is not important. It is
important if ceria is so heavily reduced that AFM structured
Ce2O3 is formed, but that is not the case in this work. The
formation of localised reduced Ce3+ species upon removal of
a neutral oxygen atom is well known and consistently described
with the DFT + U approach.10–17 For the Pd doped (111) surface,
one Ce3+ is in the outermost Ce layer, while the second Ce3+ is
found in the next atomic layer of Ce. In the (110) surface, both
Ce3+ ions are found in the outermost surface layer. The Ni doped
surfaces with an active oxygen vacancy similarly show Ce3+
formation.
The PEDOS for the Ce 4f states in the Pd doped surfaces,
plotted in Fig. 11(c) and (d), show the presence of reduced Ce3+
ions, which are manifested as peaks in the band gap between the
valence band and the empty Ce 4f states.10–17

Conclusions
We have presented DFT + U and hybrid DFT simulations of
Pd and Ni cations, which have a 2+ oxidation state, doped into
the ceria (111) and (110) surfaces. Our results highlight impor-
tant points that need to be considered when performing simu-
lations of cation doping of ceria. One must consider the
oxidation state of the cation, and the charge compensation
mechanism, and the type of coordination environment which the
dopant prefers.
Pd and Ni distort the local atomic structure to have coordi-
nation environment that is favourable and their lower oxidation
state relative to Ce means that oxygen vacancies spontaneously
form to compensate the dopant oxidation state.
From the stable charge compensated structures, the formation
of active oxygen vacancies is found to be more favourable
compared with the undoped surfaces. This conﬁrms the utility of
these dopants in ceria-based materials for catalysis, at least for
oxidation reactions and also for solid oxide fuel cells, where
oxygen vacancy formation is important.
Together with a growing body of existing work on the elec-
tronic properties of undoped and doped ceria that has high-
lighted dopant ionic radius and the existence of multiple
energetically similar solutions as important factors, the present
results shed further light on the factors that need to be
considered when designing doped oxide systems for technology
applications.
