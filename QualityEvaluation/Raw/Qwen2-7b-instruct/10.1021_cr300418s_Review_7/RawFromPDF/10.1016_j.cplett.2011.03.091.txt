DFT + U calculations of Cu-doped bulk ceria are presented. The ﬁrst oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria
forms almost spontaneously and the second vacancy is also easily created. Whether zero, one or two oxy-
gen vacancies, the Cu dopant is in the form Cu(+II), and prefers to be 4-coordinated in a close to planar
structure. Charge compensation, structural relaxation and available Cu–O states all play roles in lowering
the O vacancy formation energies, but to different degrees when the ﬁrst and second oxygen vacancies
are formed. The Cu-doped ceria(1 1 1) surface system behaves in a similar fashion.

1. Introduction
Several studies in the literature have shown that copper–ceria
systems (Cu–CeO2) are efﬁcient catalysts for the water–gas shift
(WGS) reaction (see, for example, Ref. [1]), the reduction of SO2
by CO [2], and the selective hydrogen combustion reaction [3].
Cu–CeO2 systems are also interesting in the context of solid oxide
fuel cell (SOFC) technology [4] due to the excellent electronic con-
ductivity of Cu and the high catalytic activity of CeO2 for C–H bond
breaking in CH4, especially when mixed with particular noble met-
als dopants [5].
In the present Letter we discuss Cu-doped ceria. For the WGS
and the SOFC applications, the literature suggests that it is copper
metal at the Cu/ceria interface that is particularly active. In other
cases, however, Cu-doped ceria surfaces are believed to be the ac-
tive catalysts, as in the case of SO2 reduction by CO referred to
above. On the whole, it should be noted that the exact form of
Cu in Cu–Ce–O catalysts is still a matter of debate and depends
much on the particular preparation protocol used. For example,
Avgouropoulos et al. [6] concluded that either ﬁnely dispersed cop-
per oxide, or a solid solution, or alternatively, a combination of
these two, may be formed on the surface of ceria in the CuO–
CeO2 catalysts. Djinovic et al. [7] reported both nanosized and
bulk-like CuO species on the ceria surfaces of their Cu–Ce–O cata-
lysts, but in addition presented evidence for strong metal oxide-
support interactions (SMSI) with CuO partly integrated into CeO2,
forming a solid solution.
Controlled experiments reported in the literature give some
information about the structure and dynamics of Cu-doped ceria
solid solutions. Electrical conductivity measurements have shown
that a CuxCe1xO2d (0 6 x 6 0.10) solid solution exhibits good
oxide-ion conductivity [8]. As for structure, Bera et al. [9] pre-
sented a comprehensive experimental study of Cu-doped ceria
samples using a range of methods; their EXAFS analyses for
CuxCe1xO2d samples with x equal to 0.03, 0.05 and 0.10 sug-
gested that Cu has three oxygen atoms in its ﬁrst coordination
shell, located at a distance of 1.96 Å. Wang et al. [10] performed
synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (XRD) and EXAFS measure-
ments for CuxCe1 - xO2 samples with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 as well
as quantum–mechanical calculations). Their EXAFS ﬁts indicated a
Cu–O coordination number of 5–6 (while their quantum–mechan-
ical calculations suggested that the Cu atom in bulk ceria has four
oxygen atom neighbors at a distance of 1.92–1.95 Å). Moreover, in
their experiments they also found that the Cu dopants always gave
rise to a corresponding number of O vacancies, i.e. that vacancy for-
mation is very much facilitated by Cu doping and the oxygen storage
capacity remarkably enhanced [10]. Here, we will explore exactly
that property by means of quantum–mechanical calculations.
Only a few quantum–mechanical studies of the structure and
electronic properties of the Cu–CeO2 systems have appeared in
the literature. To the best of our knowledge all these studies ex-
plored unreduced samples, i.e. without O vacancies. As mentioned,
Wang et al. studied bulk CeO2, CuO, Cu2O, Cu0.25Ce0.75O2 and
Cu0.125Ce0.875O2 [10], while Shapovalov and Metiu [11] reported

on top of the CeO2(1 1 1) surface (this gave a Cu(+I) ion) and the
weaker adsorption above an O vacancy (gave a negative Cu ion)
as part of a study of CO and CO2 interacting with the Cu–CeO2 sys-
tem. Branda et al. [13] also studied a Cu atom on top of an O-ter-
minated CeO2(1 1 1) (with a variety of LDA + U and GGA + U
ﬂavors) in a study of Cu, Ag and Ag on ceria(1 1 1). They found
Cu symmetrically surrounded by three O atoms to be the most
favorable adsorption site with all the different methods they tried,
as we also did in Ref. [12], and as us, they found that Cu oxidizes to
Cu(+I). In Ref. [12], we also studied the Cu-doped ceria(1 1 1)
surface.
In the present density functional theory (DFT) study we continue
to study the effect of Cu-doping, this time for bulk ceria. We will
ﬁnd that the ﬁrst oxygen vacancy in Cu-doped ceria is formed al-
most spontaneously and the formation of a second vacancy is also
facile. We will also ﬁnd that charge compensation, structural relax-
ation and available d- and f-electron levels all play a role here, but to
different degrees when the ﬁrst and second oxygen vacancies are
formed. We end the Letter by making some comparisons between
bulk and surface of Cu-doped ceria and in the conclusion section
we give some general remarks about the effect of aliovalent transi-
tion metal dopants on the O vacancy formation in ceria.
2. Computational details
2.1. Electronic structure calculations
Spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vien-
na ab initio simulation package (VASP) package [14,15] with the
projector augmented wave (PAW) method [16] and the Perdew–
Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [17]. The cerium 5s, 5p, 5d, 4f,
6s, the oxygen 2s, 2p and the copper 3d, 4s electrons were treated
as valence electrons.
Based on the discussion in Ref. [18] and some references there-
in, the PBE + U method [19] was applied to accurately describe the
strong on-site Coulomb repulsion of the Ce4f electrons. Here an
effective U value of 5.0 eV was chosen to give a balanced and ade-
quate description of the atomic and electronic structures for both
stoichiometric
(CeO2)
and
partially
reduced
ceria
(CeO2x)
[18,20]. In all of our calculations, plane waves were used as the ba-
sis set, with an energy cutoff of 30 Ry. The structure optimizations
were performed until the force on each atom was smaller than
0.02 eV/Å. An atomic charge analysis was performed according to
the Bader scheme [21].
2.2. Model systems and the deﬁnition of the O vacancy formation
energy
Crystalline CeO2 bulk has the ﬂuorite structure where one Ce
atom is surrounded by eight oxygen atoms (similar to the framed
region in Figure 1a). The current calculations for stoichiometric
ceria give an equilibrium lattice parameter of 5.480 Å; the experi-
mental room-temperature value is 5.411 Å [22].
For Cu-doped bulk, a supercell containing 96 atoms was built
from the conventional 12-atom cubic unit cell of CeO2 with a
2  2  2 replication and one Ce atom was replaced by a Cu atom.
This corresponds to a dopant concentration of 3% and is denoted
as Ce0.97Cu0.03O2. The structure was optimized using either a 3 k-
point grid (corresponding to a 3  3  3 Monkhorst–Pack grid
[23]) or only one k point (the gamma point). The total energy was
found to be the same within 0.01 eV and the local structure around
the Cu defect was almost identical. Here we then subsequently used
one k point for all bulk systems (unreduced and reduced), and a
GAUSSIAN smearing parameter Sigma of 0.01 eV. The doped system
was assumed to keep the cubic structure and therefore forced to do
so, and the cell parameter and atomic positions were optimized,
resulting in a cell change of less than 0.05%, compared to the un-
doped case. Thus for all of the systems studied in this Letter, the cell
parameters were ﬁxed at the corresponding undoped values.
Oxygen vacancies were created in various positions with
respective the Cu dopant; details are given in the Results and dis-
cussion section. The O vacancy formation energy (Evac) was calcu-
lated after optimization of the atomic positions for each system
according to
First Evac ¼ Eðcell with one O vacancyÞ þ 1=2 EðO2Þ
 Eðcell without an O vacancyÞ
ð1Þ
Second Evac ¼ Eðcell with two O vacanciesÞ þ 1=2 EðO2Þ
 Eðcell with one O vacancyÞ
ð2Þ
E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an optimized
oxygen molecule in the gas phase. A positive value of Evac means
that energy is needed to create a vacancy.
As an alternative to using the oxygen molecule as a reference
state in the formulas above, and in an attempt to avoid the DFT er-
ror connected to the description of the O2 molecule, one might pre-
fer to use the O atom as the reference state instead. The difference
between these deﬁnitions of Evac is exactly half the binding energy
for O2. Our calculated value for the binding energy is 6.18 eV. Here
we only report the Evac value with respect to the PBE-calculated O2
molecule.

3. Results and discussion
Table 1 lists quantities related to the interaction between the Cu
dopant and bulk ceria, namely, Evac, R(Cu–O) and the net (Bader)
charge that the Cu atom acquires in the various systems. The opti-
mized structures and the details of the electronic structure such as
the total density of states (TDOS) and the corresponding electron
densities are shown in the ﬁgures. Results for the ceria(1 1 1) sur-
face are given in Table 1 for comparison and are discussed in
Section 3.3.
3.1. Cu-doped bulk ceria
A Ce atom was replaced by a Cu atom in bulk CeO2 in the 96-
atom supercell. The Cu dopant was thus initially placed at the cen-
ter of one of the cubes formed by the 8 oxygen atoms surrounding
the Ce atom in ceria. The optimization brought the Cu atom (al-
most) all the way down to the face of the O cube. At this new posi-
tion, the Cu atom is 4-coordinated in a close-to-planar structure
(Figure 1a) similar to the Cu coordination in CuO bulk (Figure 1b).
The Cu ion is seen to distort the ceria lattice by contracting the O
square surrounding it and pushing away those O atoms which lost
their cation neighbor when Cu moved away. The Cu-dopant loses
about 1.20 electrons according to the Bader charge analysis when
incorporated in the ceria lattice, and thus becomes Cu+1.20. This is
even a little more than the Cu charge in pure CuO bulk (Cu+1.02),
mainly due to the O-rich environment in ceria. The Cu dopant
has only a small effect on the Ce charges but some of the O ions be-
come less negative (by in total about 2 electrons), compared to un-
doped CeO2.
An O vacancy was introduced as a nearest-neighbor (NN) to the
Cu dopant, the structure was reoptimized, and Evac was calculated
to 0.98 eV, which is much smaller than for undoped ceria (3.28 eV
in our calculations). The Cu dopant is here coordinated by three O
neighbors (Figure 2a, Table 1) and the three Ce cations surround-
ing the vacancy are all (nominally) Ce4+, contrary to the situation
for undoped ceria where an O vacancy gives rise to two Ce4+ and
two Ce3+ ions (nominal charges) next to the O vacancy. If instead
an O atom which is a next-nearest neighbor (NNN) to the Cu dop-
ant is removed (Figure 2b, Table 1), we ﬁnd that it is even easier
to create an O vacancy: now Evac is only 0.30 eV. The coordination
around Cu is here 4-fold, with Cu–O bond lengths similar to those
in the CuO crystal structure [24], where Cu2+ has four O neighbors
within 1.90–2.00 Å and the next-nearest O neighbors reside 0.8–
0.9 Å further away. The three Ce cations surrounding the vacancy
are (nominally) Ce4+ and their Bader charges differ very little
from pure CeO2 (or unreduced Cu-doped CeO2), mainly because
the O vacancy reinstates the charge balance in the system and
remedies the shortage of electrons caused by the lower valence
of Cu (2+) compared to Ce (4+), i.e. makes the O ions more
negative again.
The Bader charge of the nominal Cu2+ ion is +0.98 and +1.06 for
the NN and NNN reduced cases, respectively. The Cu ion thus con-
tinues to be a Cu(+II) ion (cf. the Bader charge of +1.02 for Cu in
CuO) even after the O vacancy is formed close to it.
Since we ﬁnd that the ﬁrst O vacancy is essentially a spontane-
ous defect in Cu-doped ceria (especially at the NNN position), the
second O vacancy becomes particularly interesting in the context
of this material’s catalytic functionality. We created an O vacancy
dimer by removing the O atom neighboring the ﬁrst (NNN) oxygen
vacancy, as shown in Figure 3. Evac for the second O vacancy is
2.39 eV, which is still smaller than Evac in stoichiometric ceria bulk.

The local 4-fold CuO coordination persists (Figure 3, Table 1) and
the Cu charge is +1.03, i.e. very similar to the charge for one va-
cancy only. Two of the nominal Ce4+ cations neighboring the O va-
cancy are reduced to Ce3+ (denoted as ‘#’ in Figure 3) and develop
spin moments of about 1.0 lB each. The magnetic spin moment is
0.46 lB for the Cu dopant, resulting in a total spin moment of
2.83 lB for the supercell.
3.2. The mechanisms facilitating the O vacancy formation with a Cu
dopant
It has been suggested in the literature that Evac depends almost
linearly on the ionic radius of the dopant ions for tetravalent ele-
ments doped into bulk ceria [25]. This suggests that structural
relaxation is the main factor governing the reduction of the Evac.
What can be expected for the Cu dopant, an aliovalent dopant with
lower valence (Cu2+) as compared with the host cations (Ce4+)? Is
structural relaxation or electronic effects the main factor responsi-
ble for the lowering of Evac?
To help answer this question we use a somewhat simplistic
model and divide Evac into an elastic and an electronic part. More
details about the procedure can be found in Ref. [26]. It involves
calculating the total energies for all the unrelaxed reduced sys-
tems. For the ﬁrst O vacancy (in the NNN position), two addi-
tional
single-point
calculations
were
therefore
performed,
namely, for the unrelaxed CeO1.97 and Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.97 bulk sys-
tems. This allowed us to calculate the energy cost to rigidly re-
move an O atom from the optimized CeO2 and Ce0.97Cu0.03O2
crystals, respectively. Subsequent relaxations of the two struc-
tures yielded energy gains of 1.40 eV for CeO1.97 and 2.79 eV for
Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.97. Thus the energy gain due to the relaxation of
Cu-doped ceria bulk is 1.39 eV larger than for undoped ceria bulk
(namely, 2.79 eV versus 1.40 eV). These energy gains are already
‘included’ in the ﬁnal Evac values of 3.28 and 0.30 eV for undoped
and Cu-doped ceria bulk.
Thus, out of the total dopant-induced lowering of Evac by 2.98 eV,
we ﬁnd that 1.39 eV is due to the additional relaxation taking place

vacancies. (For interpretation of the references in color in this ﬁgure, the reader is

in the presence of the dopant. This contribution to the lowering of
the vacancy formation energy is mainly due to the different radii
of the dopant (0.74 Å for Cu2+) and the host cation (0.92 Å for Ce4+)
[27]. The remainder (1.59 eV) must be attributed to the changes in
electronic structure induced by the Cu2+ dopant. Wang et al. [10] as-
cribe the easy formation of O vacancies in Cu-doped bulk ceria to a
large strain in the ceria lattice introduced by the Cu dopant.
The second Evac value (2.39 eV) for the Cu-doped system is
0.89 eV smaller than the ﬁrst Evac value for undoped ceria bulk.
We will ﬁnd that this decrease is dominated by dopant-induced
electronic structure changes. Also here additional calculations
were performed to pinpoint the respective contributions from
strain and electronic effects. An O atom was removed rigidly (no
relaxation was allowed) from the optimized Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.97 sys-
tem, creating Ce0.97Cu0.03O1.94, which was subsequently allowed
to relax. The relaxation energy was found to be 1.05 eV, i.e.
0.35 eV smaller than that accompanying the formation of the ﬁrst
vacancy of undoped ceria (1.40 eV). Since the total lowering of Evac
for the second vacancy in Cu-doped ceria is 0.89 eV relative to the
ﬁrst vacancy in undoped ceria (cf. Table 1), we conclude that dop-
ant-induced changes in the electronic structure decrease Evac by
1.24 eV (0.35 + 0.89 eV).
In summary, both the ﬁrst and second Evac energies in our Cu-
doped bulk ceria samples are smaller than Evac for undoped ceria
(3.28 eV). For the ﬁrst vacancy, the lowering is as large as 2.98 eV
and our analysis shows that about half of this decrease can be
attributed to electronic effects and half to large structural relaxa-
tion when the Cu dopant is present. For the second vacancy, the
Evac lowering is 0.89 eV compared to the same undoped ceria value
(3.28 eV). Here the electronic effects are responsible for 100% of the
decrease, since the smaller relaxation energy actually increases the
Evac value compared to undoped ceria.

Figure 4a displays the total density of states (TDOS) for the stoi-
chiometric CeO2 bulk. Undoped CeO2 is an insulator with a calcu-
lated O2p-Ce4f gap of 2.2 eV with the functional we use here.
The valence band has mostly O2p character with some contribu-
tion from Ce4f5d and the sharp peak above the valence band is
from the Ce4f states.
The TDOS for partially reduced CeO2 bulk is shown in Figure 4b.
New vacancy states (occupied Ce4f states) appear below the Fermi
energy. As in previous discussions in the literature (e.g. Ref. [20]),
the electrons that occupy the new gap states are exactly localized
on two of the Ce cations neighboring the oxygen vacancy, reducing
them from +IV to +III, which is conﬁrmed by the corresponding
spin density distributions shown in Figure 5a.
The TDOS for the Cu-doped unreduced ceria bulk is shown in
Figure 4c. Compared to the undoped system in Figure 4a, two
new peaks emerge above the Fermi level, in the range of 0–
1.1 eV. The corresponding sliced (or partial) electron density
images (Figure 5b) and the Bader charge analysis show that the
low-lying of these unoccupied peaks is an oxygen hole state
(1.00 electron) and the peak close to 1 eV consists of two Cu–O
states (2.00 electrons). The oxygen hole state has O2p character
and is spread over three oxygen atoms (not neighbors of Cu), and
the Cu–O states mainly have Cu3d and O2p character and are dis-
tributed on the Cu dopant and its four O neighbors. These unoccu-
pied states can be expected to serve as electron sinks to
accommodate additional excess electrons left by the removal of
oxygen atoms, thereby facilitating the oxygen vacancy formation.
As we will see, only two of these three states will be utilized when
the ﬁrst and second O vacancies are formed in Cu-doped ceria.
When the ﬁrst vacancy is formed, Figures 4d and 5c show that
the oxygen hole state and one of the unoccupied Cu–O states from
Figure 4c become occupied.
The Cu charge changes by about 0.14 as we go from Figure 4c to
4d. Thus, the Bader charge analysis shows that the charge on the
Cu dopant decreases from +1.20 in the unreduced bulk (CuCe31O64)
to +1.06 in the bulk with the ﬁrst O vacancy (CuCe31O63), which is
closed to that in CuO bulk (+1.03). In fact, stoichiometrically, Cu-
Ce31O63 is equivalent to Ce31O62–CuO.
Two O vacancies have been created in Figure 4e. The polarized
gap peaks in the region from 0.7 to 0.0 eV consist of two contri-
butions: (i) occupied (spin up) Cu–O state which was occupied al-
ready for one O vacancy and (ii) two new peaks corresponding to
two occupied 4f states on the two new Ce3+ ions, marked by hash
marks in Figure 3. We have consequently labeled the new gap
states ‘occupied Ce4f’ in Figure 4e. The corresponding spin charge
density (Figure 5d) shows that the occupied Ce4f states are similar
to those in partially reduced ceria (Figure 5a), with two Ce3+ ions
residing next to the vacancy (vacancies). According to the Bader
charge analysis, the Cu dopant’s charge changes very slightly (from
+1.06 to +1.03) when the second vacancy is formed, in line with the
Cu–O states not being much affected.
The Ce4f states that become occupied in Figure 4e lie closer to
the valence band edge than the Ce4f states in Figure 4b. This trend
is consistent with our discussion above about electronic effects
(new states and/or shifts of levels) on the Evac values and the low-
ering of the second Evac in Cu-doped bulk ceria compared to the
ﬁrst Evac in undoped bulk ceria. However, the shift of the Ce4f
states in Figure 4 is too small to be the sole reason for this
lowering.
In summary, we have found that the O hole state and Cu–O
states, play major roles as electron sinks when the ﬁrst O vacancy
is formed in Cu-doped ceria. When the second vacancy is formed,
the Ce4f states are the most important electron sink (just as they
are for the ﬁrst vacancy in undoped ceria), but we cannot fully ex-
plain the lowering of the second vacancy in Cu-doped ceria com-
pared to the ﬁrst vacancy in undoped CeO2.
3.3. Comparison between Cu-doped bulk and surface
Unreduced and reduced Cu-doped ceria(1 1 1) surfaces were
studied by us in Ref. [12], using a similar computational procedure
as here. Our surface model was a 3-dimensional lamellar slab sys-
tem and the outermost slab layer on each side consisted of O
atoms. On one side of the CeO2(1 1 1) slab, one Ce atom in the out-
ermost Ce layer was replaced by a Cu atom, which corresponds to a
dopant concentration of 8%, i.e. Cu0.08Ce0.92O2(1 1 1).
Starting from its original Ce position, the Cu dopant in Ref. [12]
was found to relax inwards, ending up in the subsurface oxygen
layer and adopting a nearly planar structure coordinated by four
O ions (one surface oxygen, two subsurface oxygen and one
third-layer oxygen). The coordination ﬁgure at the Cu-doped sur-
face is very similar to that of the Cu-doped bulk system (cf. Table 1).
The charge of the Cu-dopant is +1.15 in the surface system com-
pared to +1.20 in the bulk; both are in the Cu(+II) state.
The Evac value for the undoped ceria(1 1 1) surface is about
0.40 eV smaller than in the bulk (Table 1). Two surface Ce4+ cations
next to the vacancy are reduced to Ce3+ (we have not investigated
any other possible conﬁgurations of the excess electrons associated
with the vacancy, as was done in Ref. [28]). For the Cu-doped cer-
ia(1 1 1) surface, either a NN surface oxygen atom residing 1.85 Å
from Cu or a NNN surface oxygen at 3.70 Å from Cu was removed.
In the former case, no large structural changes occurred, while for
the NNN O vacancy, the Cu–O bond lengths elongate by about
0.1 Å. Just as for the bulk, the ﬁrst Evac values are small, and the
NNN vacancy location is the most favorable (forms almost sponta-
neously; Table 1). Also a second vacancy forms more easily when
Cu is present in the surface region. The local 4-coordination is kept
for the NNN single vacancy as well as for the vacancy dimer.
4. Conclusions
Our PAW/PBE + U results for Cu-doped ceria show that:
(a) The Cu dopant adopts a 4-coordinated, almost planar, Cu–O
coordination both in the unreduced system and when one or
two O vacancies are present.
(b) The charge of the Cu dopant varies rather little (<0.2 elec-
trons) for all the Cu-doped system studied here. In all cases
we ﬁnd Cu2+ species, or rather Cu(+II), and we do not ﬁnd the
formation of Cu+ in the current studies (which we found ear-
lier for the Cu adatom);
(c) Out of the two electrons left over when the ﬁrst O vacancy is
formed, one localizes in an O2p hole state which belongs to
three oxygen atoms which are next-nearest neighbors to
the Cu atom, and the other localizes in a Cu–O orbital. As
for the two additional electrons that are left over when the
second O vacancy is formed, each localizes on a Ce atom
neighboring the new O vacancy, creating two Ce3+ ions;
(d) Evac is much reduced by the Cu dopant, for both the ﬁrst and
the second O vacancies, suggesting that the Cu dopant can
serve as the seed for the formationof oxygen vacancy clusters;
(e) The large lowering of the ﬁrst O vacancy induced by the Cu
dopant is in part (about 50%) due to dopant-induced struc-
tural relaxation, and in part to the charge balance require-
ment, i.e. the ﬁlling of the unoccupied O2p hole state and
the unoccupied Cu-O state created by the dopant because
of the lower valence of Cu2+ compared to Ce4+;
(f) For the second O vacancy, the dopant-induced lowering of
Evac is partly due to the lowering of the Ce4f states compared
to pure CeO2x.
Many of these conclusions should be generally valid for an alio-
valent transition metal dopant (i.e. with lower valence than the

65
host cations), which we expect to generally be potent in facilitating
the O vacancy formation in a reducible oxide. Charge compensa-
tion, structural relaxation and available Cu–O states all play a role
in the mechanisms responsible for lowering the O vacancy forma-
tion energies (compared to the undoped case), but to different de-
grees when the ﬁrst and second oxygen vacancies are formed. The
Cu-doped bulk and ceria(1 1 1) surface systems are found to dis-
play very consistent properties.
