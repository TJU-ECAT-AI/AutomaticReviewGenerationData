Yim, Pang, and Thornton Reply: The Comment of
Wendt et al. [1] on our Letter [2] primarily claims that
the electron beam method that we use in our experiment to
vary the density of bridging oxygen vacancies (Ob vac) on
rutile TiO2ð110Þ also leads to damage of the near-surface
region. Contrary to this assertion, in a two-photon photo-
emission spectroscopy study of TiO2ð110Þ, Onda et al. [3]
demonstrate that the defects created on the nearly perfect
TiO2ð110Þ surface after exposure to a 500 eV electron
dose are completely healed by a submonolayer coverage of
O2 at 100 K. This indicates that the defects are located at
the surface. In contrast, defects formed by thermal anneal-
ing can only be partially quenched by O2 exposure, sug-
gesting an additional contribution from the subsurface
region. The electrons in our experiment are less energetic
(75 eV) than those employed by Onda et al. [3]. On this
basis, it is clear that we do not expect to induce any
signiﬁcant damage in the near-surface region (as opposed
to the surface plane) with our electron beam.
The evidence presented to support the claim of a subsur-
face change produced by the electron beam is the supposed
nonlinearity of the Ob vac density dependence on the
electron irradiation time compared with the variation of
the band gap photoemission intensity. However, this de-
viation from a perfect straight line is the scatter that might
be expected where there is a small variation in Ob vac
density across the surface. This will be reﬂected in the
STM measurement because only a nanoscale area is mea-
sured, while the photoemission data are macroscopically
averaged.
Measurements on the hydroxylated surface (h-TiO2)
were designed to measure the connection between the
band-gap state and Ob vac in a different way. It relies on
the known creation of OHb by the reaction of H2O with Ob
vac [4,5] and the unchanged intensity of the band-gap state
when an Ob vac is converted to OHb [6]. The data, which
are shown in Fig. 1, are very clear in showing that the band-
gap state scales linearly with the density of OHb species
created by reacting water with the Ob vac [the values are
plotted in Fig. 4(b) in Ref. [2]]. Part of this data set shows
the effect on the band-gap state of oxidizing h-TiO2, with a
reduction to 15% of its original intensity. Electron beam
irradiation for 10 s and rehydroxylation restores the band-
gap state and the OHb density to their original values. This
is all consistent with a dominating Ob vac contribution to
the band-gap state. It is worth noting that the reduction of
the band-gap state to 15% on oxidation compares with a
ﬁgure of 60%–70% quoted in Refs. [1,7]. The latter values
were used to associate Ti interstitials with the band-gap
state. A likely cause of this discrepancy is the ex situ nature
of the earlier measurements, which rely on the repeatabil-
ity of sample preparation procedures. In contrast, our STM
and photoemission measurements were carried out on
identical surfaces in situ.

band-gap state [0:9 eV below the Fermi level (EF)] is shown in
the spectra. The data points are shown as squares, and the curves
are the best ﬁt to a Gaussian and polynomial background. The
spectra in (f) corresponding to each surface are colored the same

median corresponds to (d), and the highest corresponds to (e).
