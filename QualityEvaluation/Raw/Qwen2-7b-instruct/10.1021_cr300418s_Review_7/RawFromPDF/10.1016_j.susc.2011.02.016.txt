We use ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy (UHV–STM) to probe, at the atomic level, the
structure of mass-selected isolated V1, V2, VO and VO2 clusters deposited on rutile TiO2(110) by ion soft
landing. All four species interact differently with the TiO2 surface and the ultimate binding site and
conﬁguration strikes a balance between the gas-phase structure and the ligation of this cluster by the TiO2
surface. Our results show that vanadium atoms prefer to bind in the upper threefold hollow sites on the
surface and have a slight tendency to pair along the [1–10] direction, while vanadium dimers bind to the
surface oriented along the [001] direction exclusively. VO clusters bind with the vanadium atom in the upper
threefold hollow site and with the oxygen atom bound to an adjacent ﬁvefold coordinated Ti atom (5c-Ti). The
VO2 cluster also binds with the vanadium atom in the upper threefold hollow site and with both oxygen atoms
bound to adjacent 5c-Ti atoms or with only one oxygen bound to the surface and the other directed out of the
plane of the surface.

1. Introduction
Vanadium oxide particles supported on TiO2 are known to catalyze
a number of reactions including the selective oxidation of methanol to
formaldehyde [1,2]. Detailed understanding of the composition of the
active vanadia and the interaction between the vanadia and the
titania support are important in providing an atomistic model for the
catalytic properties of this system. To this end, a number of model
catalyst studies have been carried out both experimentally [3–14] and
theoretically [14–19]. Madix and coworkers have prepared submo-
nolayer ﬁlms of catalytically active vanadium oxide on TiO2 by
hydrolysis of VOCl3 in UHV [4,5]. Subsequent characterization of these
ﬁlms by XPS mainly showed vanadium in its 5+ oxidation state, but
details regarding the structure of the clusters proved difﬁcult given
the size distribution [4]. Another approach adopted by several groups
is to grow submonolayer vanadia ﬁlms by evaporative deposition of
vanadium metal in an oxygen-rich environment and/or post-
oxidation of deposited vanadium clusters in an oxygen atmosphere
[6–11]. A mixture of vanadium oxidation states was observed, with
the vanadium being more highly oxidized after annealing in higher
background pressures of oxygen [8–11]. Again, atomic level-models
were not possible, given the distribution in size and composition of
the clusters.
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) has also been used to provide
direct visualization of vanadium and vanadia particles on single crystal
CeO2 (111) [8,9] and TiO2(110)-(1×1) [11–13]. For vanadium atoms and
small VOx clusters deposited on CeO2(111), Freund and coworkers
showed that the V atoms bind to the upper threefold hollow site. Slight
oxidation of the vanadium produced isolated VO and small clusters of VOx
(i.e. VO2 and VO3) arranged with a vanadyl V=O bond directed out of the
plane of the surface [8,9]. Submonolayer ﬁlms of metallic vanadium were
deposited on TiO2(110)-(1×1) by evaporative deposition from a
vanadium source [12,13], while oxides were generated by either reactive
evaporation or post-oxidation [11]. In these experiments, a variety of
cluster sizes and morphologies was found, indicating that a mixture of
vanadia cluster compositions was deposited. This mixture made it difﬁcult
to pinpoint the exact number of vanadium and oxygen atoms in a cluster,
which is crucial information for determining any atomistic model.
In an effort to gain a more detailed understanding of these
model catalysts, we deposit mass-selected Vx and VxOy clusters on rutile
TiO2(110)-(1×1) in ultra high vacuum (UHV). Size-selection allows us to
control the exact composition of the vanadium and vanadia clusters. The
cluster-decorated surfaces (~0.01 ML coverage) are then characterized
using STM in ordertodetermine theadsorption site andgeometry of each
particular vanadium or vanadia cluster. Additional insight is gained by
comparing these results with previously reported DFT structures [15,16].
This comparison allows us to build a detailed structural model of the
various vanadium and vanadium oxide particles on TiO2(110).

2. Experimental
These experiments were carried out in a UHV apparatus with a base
pressure below 1×10−10 Torr. TiO2(110) samples (Commercial Crystal
Laboratories) were cleaned in UHV with several cycles of argon ion
bombardment (1 kV) and annealing (~1200 K for 10 s). Sample
cleanliness was veriﬁed by STM. Immediately prior to deposition,
samples were ﬂashed to ~1000 K for several seconds to ensure that
surface hydroxyls were removed.
The apparatus used to generate size-selected vanadium and
vanadium oxide clusters has been described previously [20] and only
details relevant to these experiments are described here. The second
harmonic output of a pulsed yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) laser is
focused onto a rotating, translating vanadium rod, which generates a
plasma of ablated vanadium atoms. A pulse of argon is introduced into
the source, resulting in plasma reactions that cause vanadium and
vanadium oxide cluster growth. Positive ions are extracted, accelerated,
and focused using several steering lenses before being size-selected by a
magnetic-ﬁeld analyzer. The ions can then be collected on a movable
plate detector, where mass spectra and kinetic energy distributions for
the ion beam are recorded by measuring the ion current. A mass
spectrum of the vanadium ion beam is shown in Fig. 1a. Seeding the
argon expansion gas with 20% oxygen yields an ion beam composed of
VxOy
+ ions, as shown in themass spectrumin Fig. 1b. This mass spectrum
agrees well with previous reports of positively-charged vanadia ion
beams produced by laser ablation [21,22].
Clusters are deposited on the TiO2(110) substrate by moving the ion
detector out of the path of the ion beam and then focusing and steering
the beam towards the sample, which is housed in the UHV deposition
chamber. During deposition, the TiO2 sample is positively biased at a
voltage equal to the average ion kinetic energy that was measured on
the detector. This allows the clusters to be soft-landed with incident
kinetic energy between 0 and 3 eV/atom. Measuring the ion current on
the sample during deposition provides an upper-bound estimate of the
expected vanadium or vanadia coverage. In each of our experiments,
0.01–0.05 ML of size-selected vanadium clusters was deposited,
assuming a sticking probability of unity. Monolayer coverage is deﬁned
as one vanadium atom per TiO2 unit cell. Samples are characterized
using STM, and the actual cluster coverage is determined from analysis
of the STM data. STM imaging is carried out at room temperature using a
sample bias of +1.3 to +2.1 V and a constant tunneling current of
0.2 nA. Most STM images were recorded within 20 min to several hours
following deposition, however, samples were also imaged for several
days after deposition with no signiﬁcant changes in the density or
appearance of the clusters.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Size-selected vanadium clusters on TiO2(110)-(1×1)
STM characterization of a clean TiO2(110)-(1×1) surface shows an
array of alternating bright and dark stripes, which correspond to rows
of ﬁvefold coordinated Ti atoms (5c-Ti) and bridging oxygen atoms,
respectively [23]. STM images recorded after depositing V1
+ are
presented in Fig. 2a and b. The bright spots that appear on the rows
are vanadium atoms. A large-area image (Fig. 2a) shows that the V1
atoms bind to the TiO2 surface with no preference for step edge sites
and do not form large three-dimensional clusters. The low mobility
and monodisperse size of these clusters indicates that the monomers
do not sinter. This result was also observed for evaporatively
deposited vanadium [12,13] and was attributed to the high reactivity

of vanadium with the titania surface [12]. The vanadium monomers
appear slightly elongated (~9 Å) in the [001] direction and are 1.7 Å in
height, indicating that the features are one atomic layer tall [12,13].
The elongation of vanadium clusters along the [001] direction of the
TiO2(110) surface has also been observed by Agnoli and coworkers,
where vanadium clusters appeared 10–15 Å long [12]. The high-
resolution image of Fig. 2b shows two types of features: isolated V
atoms (marked with a circle) and coffee bean-shaped structures
formed by pairs of vanadium monomers aligned along the [1–10]
direction (marked with a square). These are the only types of features
that resulted from the deposition of vanadium atoms.
All isolated V1 features (depicted within the circle of Fig. 2b) are
positioned between the 5c-Ti and bridging oxygen rows. This is
consistent with the structural model proposed by Asaduzzaman and
Kruger [15] in which the vanadium atoms are bound to the upper
threefold hollow sites between the 5c-Ti and bridging oxygen rows. A
model showing the binding of a V atom to this site is shown in Fig. 2c.
This assignment is also consistent with previous STM results where the
vanadium was deposited using an evaporation source [12]. The bonding
of the vanadium to these three oxygen atoms, coupled with DFT
calculations showing that the vanadium atom transfers electrons to its
neighboring oxygen atoms [15], suggests that this electronic effect is
responsible for the observed elongation of the vanadium clusters in our
work and in the work of Agnoli et al. [12]. For pairs of V1 atoms oriented
along [1–10] (the coffee-bean shape depicted within the square of
Fig. 2b), both vanadium atoms are located in upper threefold hollow
sites and are separated by a bridging oxygen row, as shown in the model
presented in Fig. 2d. The distance between vanadium atoms measured
by STM is 4.0 Å, which is ~2.3 times longer than the V―V bond length in
gas-phase V2 [24], suggesting that these are two individualV monomers,
rather than dimeric vanadium.
The coffee bean-like features we attribute to V-atom pairs are similar
to those which were previously reported for evaporatively deposited
vanadium [12]. However, in the work of Agnoli et al. [12], clusters
elongated in the [001] direction were also observed. The fraction of
clusters paired along [001] is small but signiﬁcant. Statistical analysis
carried out in the work of Agnoli, et al. showed that 81% of the observed
clusters were single monomers, 15% were pairs of atoms along [1–10],
and 4% were pairs of atoms along [001] [12]. Excluding the features
paired along [001], 84% of the clusters were isolated and 16% exhibited
the coffee-bean structure. In our experiments, we observe a different
distribution of features. Upon deposition of size-selected vanadium
monomer, a statistical analysis of 21 images similar to that shown in
Fig. 2a exhibits a distribution where 45% of the features are isolated
monomers and 55% of the features are pairs of atoms along [1–10].
Based on our observed coverage of ~0.01 monolayer, we would expect
very few pairs of clusters to appear randomly. Clearly, the vanadium
monomers have a greater tendency to pair along [1–10] in the present
study. We attribute this tothe mobilityof theV atomsdue totheirexcess
kinetic energy (between 0 and 3 eV) upon impact with the surface. It is
important to note that the pairing of the vanadium monomers in this
way was not predicted by DFT calculations discussed in the work of
Asaduzzaman and Kruger [15]. In the work of Asaduzzaman and Kruger
[15], the vanadium monomers were predicted to repel one another due
to their high positive charges resulting from electron transfer into the
surface. Clearly the experimental data of Fig. 2 and Agnoli, et al. [12] do
not conﬁrm this prediction, but instead suggest a propensity for the
monomers to pair along the [1–10] direction. This pairing implies that
the magnitude of electron transfer from the vanadium atoms to the
surface is much smaller than predicted by DFT calculations.
Fig. 3a shows a large-area image of V2
+ clusters deposited on titania.
Again, clusters are distributed evenly across the terraces, with no
preference for a speciﬁc type of adsorption site. The high-resolution
image presented in Fig. 3b indicates that the V2 clusters are
symmetrically positioned over the bridging oxygen rows. This is the
only shape and binding site observed for V2 clusters in our experiments.
The V2 clusters appear as ovals of length ~13 Å along [001] and height of
1.7 Å. The deposited V2 cluster is completely different than the two-
atom clusters that form after deposition of size-selected V1. The
obvious differences between the V2 clusters on the TiO2(110) surface
and the two types of features observed for V1 atoms on the surface
indicate that these two species bind differently to the surface. Based on
these STM observations, we propose that the vanadium dimer is
oriented along a bridging oxygen row as shown in Fig. 3c. The cluster is
located between two bridging oxygen atoms with both vanadium atoms
bound to their respective nearest-neighbor bridging oxygen atom.
It is interesting to note that the images of the V2 in Fig. 3b clusters
have a very similar appearance to the paired clusters oriented along
[001] that resulted from the evaporative deposited of vanadium onto
titania in the work of Agnoli, et al. [12]. Since we only see pairs of V
atoms oriented along the [1–10] direction and since we only see V
dimers oriented along [001] direction, Agnoli, et al., most likely have a
mixture of V1 and V2 emanating from their evaporation source. This is
consistent with the work of Kant, et al., which has shown that dimers are
readily formed in vanadium effusion sources [25]. Additional work by
the Armentrout group has also shown that large vanadium clusters
break up preferentially into vanadium dimers upon exposure to reactive
gas [26], a result that supports dimer emission from an evaporative
source. The presence of dimeric vanadium emanating from effusion
sources provides a further explanation for the difference in the relative
concentration of coffee-bean features in our work (where 100% of the
clusters in the mass selected source are V1) compared to the work of
Agnoli, et al.
3.2. Size-selected vanadium oxide clusters on TiO2(110)-(1×1)
Fig. 4a shows an STM image of the titania surface after deposition of
size-selected VO+. As with V2, VO remains intact upon adsorption, does
not sinter, and binds to the TiO2 surface without any preference for step-
edge sites. A higher resolution image (Fig. 4b) indicates that these
clusters are positioned between the titanium and bridging oxygen rows.
The asymmetric positioning of the cluster suggests that the vanadium
atom in the VO cluster is bound to a threefold hollow site, similar to the
Fig. 3. (a) Large-area and (b) high-resolution STM images of V2 clusters supported on
TiO2(110). (c) Top-view model showing a V2 cluster bound to the TiO2 surface. Silver, red,
and green spheres correspond to titanium, oxygen, and vanadium atoms, respectively.

binding site for vanadium atoms, and the oxygen atom binds to a 5c-Ti
atom making the cluster planar. A top-view model and a three-
dimensional side-view model showing the binding of the cluster to the
titania surface are shown in Fig. 4c and d, respectively. It is interesting to
note that this model is identical to the lowest-energy DFT structure for
VO on TiO2, as described by Shapovalov, et al. [16]. The VO clusters have
a length of 10 Å in the [001] direction and are 1.7 Å tall. Although the
height of the VO cluster is the same as that of a V monomer, the VO
cluster is slightly longer along [001]. The elongation of the VO cluster is
attributed to the binding of the oxygen atom to a 5c-Ti, as shown in the
model in Fig. 4c.
Fig. 5a shows a large-area image of VO2 clusters deposited on
titania. The high-resolution image presented in Fig. 5b indicates that
the VO2 clusters are asymmetrically positioned over the 5c-Ti rows.
The VO2 cluster is 1.7 Å tall and 14 Å long in the [001] direction. The
only observed difference between VO and VO2 clusters on TiO2(110) is
the degree of elongation along [001], which is much greater for the
VO2 clusters. Based on this, we constructed a model (Fig. 5c and d)
showing the binding of a VO2 cluster to the titania surface. In this
model, the vanadium atom (green) is positioned in the upper
threefold hollow site and both oxygen atoms (dark blue) are bound
to neighboring 5c-Ti atoms. This was also calculated to be a low-
energy structure using DFT. Although the lowest-energy DFT structure
for VO2 on TiO2(110) involves the vanadium atom sitting in an upper
threefold hollow site with one oxygen atom bound to a neighboring
5c-Ti atom and the other oxygen pointing out of the plane of the
surface [16], this structure is only 0.25 eV lower in energy than that
presented in the model in Fig. 5c and d. The height of the cluster and
elongation along [001] indicates that the slightly higher-energy
structure in the DFT calculations [16] is observed experimentally.
These results differ somewhat from those reported by Agnoli and
coworkers for reactive evaporation and post-oxidation vanadia
depositions. Reactive evaporation mainly yielded vanadia clusters
which were symmetrically positioned over the 5c-Ti rows. These
clusters varied in length along [001], leading the authors to suggest
that both monomeric and dimeric vanadia were formed [11]. It is
reasonable that vanadia monomers and dimers would be observed
after reactive evaporation, considering the evidence we have outlined
here suggesting that a mixture of metallic monomer and dimer
clusters are emitted from the effusion source. Post-oxidation resulted
in a variety of features; some clusters were symmetrically positioned
over the 5c-Ti rows, while others were still located between the Ti and
bridging oxygen rows. This result was attributed to incomplete
oxidation of the vanadium during the post-oxidation [11]. Because
DFT calculations suggest that VO3 is formed when a V-decorated TiO2
surface is exposed to oxygen [16], it is possible that the clusters
positioned symmetrically over the 5c-Ti rows in Agnoli, et al., are VO3
and other highly oxidized species (including dimers). The clusters
which are located between the Ti and bridging oxygen rows following
post-oxidation are likely a mixture of V, VO, VO2, and dimers with low
oxygen content. This is supported by XPS evidence showing that post-
oxidation results in a variety of vanadium oxidation states [3,10].
4. Conclusions
We have deposited size-selected V1, V2, VO, and VO2 clusters on
TiO2(110) and determined their preferred adsorption sites using STM.
V1, VO, and VO2 clusters are centered asymmetrically over the 5c-Ti
rows and have varying lengths along the [001] direction where the
length of V1bVObVO2. V2 clusters appear symmetrically positioned
over the bridging oxygen row. Comparison of the STM results to DFT
calculations has allowed us to determine an atomistic model for these
structures. PerformingSTMstudies on size-selected clustershas allowed
us to determine that evaporative deposition of vanadium results in a
mixture of monomers and dimers, while reactive evaporation and post-
