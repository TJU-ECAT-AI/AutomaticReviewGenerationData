Abstract
We present periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations of bulk ceria and its low index surfaces (111),
(110) and (100). We ﬁnd that the surface energies increase in the order (111) > (110) > (100), while the magnitude
of the surface relaxations follows the inverse order. The electronic properties of the bulk and surfaces are analysed
by means of the electronic density of states and the electron density. We demonstrate that the bonding in pure ceria
is partially covalent and analysis of the resulting electronic states conﬁrms the presence of localised Ce4f states above
the Fermi level. The surface atoms show only a small change in the charge distribution in comparison to the bulk and
from the DOS the main diﬀerences are due to the changes in the oxygen 2p and cerium 5 d states. Investigation of the
atomic and electronic structure of an oxygen vacancy on the (100) surface shows the problems DFT can have with
the description of strongly localised systems, wrongly predicting electron delocalisation over all of the cerium atoms
in the simulation cell. We demonstrate an improvement in the description of the strongly correlated cerium 4f states
in partially reduced ceria by applying the DFT+U methodology, which leads to the appearance of a new gap state
between the valence band and the empty Ce4f band. Analysis of the partial charge density shows that these states
are localised on the CeIII ions neighbouring the oxygen vacancy. In terms of classical defect chemistry, the vacancy
is bound by two neighbouring CeIII ions, which have been reduced from CeIV, i.e. V
O þ 2Ce0
Ce. The remaining Ce ions
are in the CeIV oxidation state. The localisation of Ce4f electrons modiﬁes the predicted structure of the defective
surface.

1. Introduction
The technological importance of cerium oxide,
CeO2, particularly its important role in automobile
three-way catalytic converters and in solid oxide
fuel cells [1], has seen it become the focus of many
experimental and computational investigations.
Since the surface properties of ceria determine
the catalytic activity of this material, much atten-
tion has been given to the study of the low index
surfaces of ceria.
Ceria is an insulating, non-magnetic rare-earth
oxide. It has a cubic ﬂuorite structure with four
cerium and eight oxygen atoms per unit cell and
an experimentally determined lattice parameter
of 5.411 A
˚ [2]. Upon partial reduction of ceria,
oxygen vacancies are formed [1]. In this reaction
the oxidation state of Ce changes reversibly from
Ce(IV) to Ce(III), the reaction being

using Kroger–Vink notation, where Ox
O is a neutral
oxygen in an oxygen lattice site, Cex
Ce is a neutral
cerium atom in a cerium site, V
O is a doubly pos-
itively charged vacancy in an oxygen site and
Ce0
Ce is a single negatively charged cerium atom
(+3 oxidation state) in a cerium site. In the Ce(III)
state, a previously unoccupied 4f state is occupied,
giving the electronic conﬁguration Ce4f1 [3]. It is
expected upon partial reduction, that the two cer-
ium atoms neighbouring the vacancy will be re-
duced to Ce(III). The reverse reaction where
Ce(III) changes to Ce(IV) is carried out through oxi-
dation. This redox process allows ceria to store or
release oxygen, depending on the oxygen partial
pressure; the oxygen storage/release capability of
ceria being central to technological applications.
Reduction of ceria and oxygen ion migration is
energetically favourable in the low index surfaces
compared to bulk [4,5] and it is thus important
to obtain an understanding of the nature of pure
and reduced ceria surfaces.
In order to facilitate the study of surface struc-
ture, thin ﬁlms of ceria have been grown on a
number of support materials including alumina,
yttrium stabilised zirconia, platinum and palla-
dium [6–8]. Experimentally, the (111) surface is
observed to be stable and undergoes little relaxa-
tion [9]. The (110) and (100) surfaces have been
observed to undergo surface relaxations [9,10]. It
has been determined through STM [10], AFM
[11], ion scattering spectroscopy [12] and low en-
ergy electron diﬀraction [13] that the (111) surface
is oxygen terminated. The (110) surface has been
studied by No
¨renberg and Briggs using STM and
electron diﬀraction [14], demonstrating that it is
terminated with a stoichiometric layer. The least
stable, and most studied, surface is (100). Cleaving
this surface gives a dipole moment perpendicular
to the surface and therefore requires a reconstruc-
tion since dipolar surfaces are unstable [15]. Gen-
erally removal of 50% of the terminating oxygen
species is observed [4,10], which Hermann demon-
strated using angular resolved mass spectroscopy
of recoiled ions [12]. No
¨renberg and Harding [10]
have presented an STM study of the pure and par-
tially reduced (100) surface of ceria. These authors
have found that surface relaxations take place in
order to reduce the surface energy. While cation
termination of the (100) surface is possible, the
anion terminated (100) surface is found to have
the lowest surface energy [4,10] and is taken as
the observed termination. Evidence for the appear-
ance of naturally occurring oxygen defects was de-
rived from the nature of the bright spots in the
STM image coupled to atomistic simulations.
Despite the fundamental importance of these
species to automotive catalysis, an understanding
of how oxygen vacancy defects modify the proper-
ties of ceria is still lacking. It is necessary to devel-
op our understanding of the oxygen storage
mechanism in cerium dioxide, in order to develop
more eﬃcient catalysts. While the electronic struc-
ture of pure bulk ceria has been well studied, with
much debate regarding the exact nature of the elec-
tronic structure, it is only in recent years that the
electronic structure of reduced ceria has been stud-
ied [3,9]. The resulting features in the UPS spec-
trum are dependent on the occupation of the
cerium 4f states [16]. In the work of Henderson
et al. [3], it was demonstrated that upon reduction
of the ceria (111) surface, a new occupied Ce4f
state appears in the gap between the valence band
and the previously unoccupied Ce4f states, 1.2 eV
above the valence band. Mullins et al. have ob-
served the formation of this same peak for reduced
218

ceria (111) thin ﬁlms grown on an Ru(0001) sup-
port [13]. This peak is due to formation of Ce3+
and the intensity of the XPS peak is related to
the amount of Ce3+ present. The Ce5d spectrum
is also modiﬁed upon reduction, with a new peak
appearing at a binding energy of 903.8–904.0 eV
[3,10]. These observations are characteristic of
the presence of Ce3+ species.
The defective (111) surface has also been stud-
ied by No
¨renberg and Briggs with STM [17]. No
signiﬁcant lateral relaxation of the surface was ob-
served and oxygen termination of this surface was
found. These authors claim that oxygen vacancy
defects initially form in triangular clusters and
upon further annealing form line defects, indicat-
ing that the clustering of the oxygen vacancy de-
fects on ceria surfaces is energetically favourable.
Namai et al. [11] have also observed these triangu-
lar and linear oxygen defects in the partially re-
duced CeO2(111) surface. These authors have
also concluded that an oxygen defect density of
greater than 1 · 1013 cm2 (approximately 1% of
top layer O2) is necessary for vacancy clustering
to occur. Oxygen vacancy clustering is also pre-
dicted from atomistic simulation to be energeti-
cally
more
favourable
than
isolated
surface
oxygen vacancies [4,11]. There have been limited
studies on the reduced (110) and (100) surfaces,
although Mullins et al. have studied the electronic
structure of reduced CeO2(110) with UPS and
have observed the appearance of the Ce4f peak
at 2.0 eV above the valence band [16].
Many studies have applied atomistic simulation
methods, using interatomic potentials, abbreviated
hereafter as IP, in order to gain an insight into
bulk and surface properties of ceria. Interatomic
potentials are parameterised analytical functions
used to describe the interactions between ions in
a material. The parameters in the functions are
generally chosen to reproduce experimental data.
A number of interatomic potentials have been
developed for the calculation of the structure of
bulk ceria and the surface energies and relaxed
structures of ceria surfaces [4,5,18–27]. In compar-
ison, the number of studies of bulk and surfaces of
ceria using ab initio methods is smaller. In CeO2,
the formal oxidation state of cerium is +4, how-
ever, two diﬀerent approaches have been devel-
oped in order to treat the ground state electronic
structure. In the ﬁrst, cerium is seen as tetravalent
with an unoccupied 4f-band (4f0) and a completely
ﬁlled O2p-band [28]. The second considers the
ground state of ceria to be a mixture of two Ce
conﬁgurations, 4f0 and 4f1 with a ﬁlled O2p va-
lence band for the former and a partially ﬁlled
O2p-valence-band in the latter [29]. In this model,
cerium is no longer strictly tetravalent.
A number of studies of ceria have been con-
cerned with elucidating the role of the Ce4f elec-
trons in the electronic structure of CeO2. In early
SCF band calculations of bulk ceria Koelling
et al. [30] concluded that some covalent bonding
is present, so that ceria is not completely ionic.
Fujimori also concluded that partial occupancy
of the Ce4f states is present [29], corresponding
to the second model above. However, Wuilloud
et al. [28] and Wachter et al. [31] have concluded
that the cerium 4f states in CeO2 are fully unoccu-
pied and localised, corresponding to the ﬁrst
model above.
In their study of the electronic properties of
bulk ceria, with Hartree–Fock theory, Hill and
Catlow (who use a minimal basis set on cerium
and oxygen) [32] and Gennard et al. (who use a
more extended basis set) [33] have neglected com-
pletely the Ce4f basis functions, under the assump-
tion that doing so does not aﬀect the bulk
properties of ceria, since the Ce4f orbitals are as-
sumed to be unoccupied. These studies found that
the bulk properties of ceria can be well described
even without the Ce4f electrons, indicating the
validity of the ﬁrst model. Recent density func-
tional theory calculations of bulk CeO2 and
Ce2O3 were presented by Skorodumova et al.,
[34] in the framework of the full-potential linear
muﬃn-tin orbital (FP-LMTO) method. The best
agreement with experiment for CeO2 was obtained
by treating the cerium 4f-functions as part of the
valence region. However, in studying fully reduced
ceria, Ce2O3, the same authors found that in order
for the Ce4f electrons to be correctly localised,
they had to be treated as core states. Treating
the 4f electrons as valence electrons, resulted in
an incorrect partially ﬁlled f-band at the Fermi
level. Choosing the f electrons to be core or
valence depending on the problem at hand is

219
clearly not a satisfactory way of understanding the
electronic structure of ceria.
In addition to studying the bulk properties of
ceria, Gennard et al. [33] also studied the (111)
and (110) surfaces using Hartree–Fock. Recently,
Skorodumova et al. [35] have studied the surface
energies and structures of the (111), (110) and
(100) surfaces using density functional theory.
Both of the ab initio studies are in agreement
with atomistic simulations regarding the relative
stability of the surfaces, (111) > (110) > (100),
although DFT predicts smaller surface energies
than atomistic simulations and Hartree–Fock [35].
In this paper we present periodic density func-
tional theory (DFT) calculations of bulk and the
three low index surfaces of pure ceria. We also
consider reduction of the (100) surface through
formation of oxygen vacancies on the (100) sur-
face. We analyse the structural and electronic
properties by means of the density of states,
charges and the charge density. We demonstrate
the presence of unoccupied Ce4f electronic states
above the Fermi level. Reduction of the (100) sur-
face leads to occupied Ce4f states which are found
to be delocalised over all of the cerium atoms with-
in the simulation cell using GGA-DFT. In order to
correctly describe the localisation of these elec-
trons, we use the DFT+U [36] methodology to
correct this failing of DFT for the (100) surface
of ceria. In addition we also examine how the
DFT+U approach aﬀects the resulting atomic
structure of the defective surface.
2. Computational methods
The DFT calculations were performed using the
Vienna ab initio simulation package VASP [37–39]
which utilises a plane-wave basis set for the
description of the valence electrons. In the present
study, we have employed the projector-augmented
wave (PAW) method [40,41] to accurately repro-
duce the eﬀect of the core electrons on the valence
electrons, with [He] and [Xe] cores for oxygen and
cerium. For the exchange-correlation functional
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
of Perdew and Wang (PW91) [42] was used. The
ions were relaxed towards equilibrium using the
quasi-Newton method until the forces were less
than 0.01 eV/A
˚ (applying a tighter convergence
criterion of 0.005 eV/A
˚ in the forces had no signif-
icant eﬀect on the distances). For the oxygen defect
vacancy structures, fully spin polarised calcula-
tions were carried out and the calculations were
also performed within the DFT+U methodology
[36], using a value of U = 5 eV. This is in reason-
able agreement with earlier DFT+U studies of
Ce metal [43], where a value of 6.1 eV was used.
To ensure the convergence of the calculations,
we computed the total energy and the equilibrium
volume of the bulk CeO2 unit cell for plane-wave
energy cut-oﬀs in the range of 300 eV and 600 eV
and on Monkhorst–Pack grids of (2 · 2 · 2),
(4 · 4 · 4) and (6 · 6 · 6) k-points. The equilib-
rium structure was obtained by ﬁtting a series of
volume-energy data to the Murnaghan equation
of state. The results show that the calculations
are
well
converged
for
a
k-point
grid
of
(4 · 4 · 4) and an energy cut-oﬀof 500 eV and
are accurate to 0.01 A
˚ 3 in the equilibrium volume
and to 0.02 eV in the total energy.
The surface calculations were performed using
the slab method [44], in which a ﬁnite number of
crystal layers in a three dimensional periodic cell
is used to generate two surfaces via the introduc-
tion of a vacuum gap perpendicular to the surface.
The vacuum gap must be large enough that inter-
actions between the periodic images perpendicular
to the surface are minimised. The slab must also be
of suﬃcient thickness that the structure in the mid-
dle of the slab is suﬃciently bulk-like. The surface
energies calculated in this work are converged to
0.01 J/m2 with respect to both the number of layers
in the slab and the vacuum thickness, where a 15 A
˚
vacuum gap was used throughout. For the (111)
surface a thickness of 10.5 A
˚ (4 atomic layers)
was suﬃcient. For the (110) and (100) surface
calculations a thickness of 11.5 A
˚ (7 atomic lay-
ers) and 18.6 A
˚ (15 atomic layers) was required.
The thicker slabs for the latter two surfaces are
necessary given their stronger relaxations in com-
parison to the (111) surface. For the surface calcu-
lations a (4 · 4 · 1) k-point grid was used, with the
third vector perpendicular to the surface, and the
energy cut-oﬀof the converged bulk calculation
(500 eV).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The low index surfaces of ceria
We have investigated the energies and proper-
ties of the three low index surfaces (111), (110)
and (100), see Fig. 1. The (111) surface is classi-
ﬁed as a type 2 surface [15] and consists of neutral
(anion–cation–anion) repeat units and thus has no
net dipole moment perpendicular to the surface.
The (110) surface is a type 1 surface and is
composed of stoichiometric layers and is therefore
also charge neutral. In contrast, the type 3 (100)
surface consists of a sequence of charged (cation–
anion) planes, which results in a dipole perpendic-
ular to the surface vector. Since the surface energy
of dipolar surfaces is theoretically inﬁnite we fol-
lowed the prescription of Ref. [45] and removed
the dipole moment by moving every second row
of oxygen atoms from one side of the slab to the
other side resulting in a surface termination with
a 50% vacant oxygen layer. While some atomistic
studies have considered cation terminated (100)
surfaces [4,10,23], these studies and experimental
data [4,10,16] support anion termination of this
surface.
The lattice constant of bulk ceria obtained in
this work is 5.470 A
˚ , and is compared to the results
of previous studies in Table 1. This is within 1.09%
of the experimental value of 5.411 A
˚ , indicating
that the DFT calculations give a reliable descrip-
tion of the structural properties of ceria. However,
the calculated bulk modulus of ceria is notably
smaller than the experimentally determined value.
Previous HF [33] and DFT [34] calculations have
also underestimated the bulk modulus of ceria,
while interatomic potentials generally overestimate
this quantity [4,19,33].
In Table 2 the surface energies of the unrelaxed
and relaxed surfaces are shown. It is found that the
relative stability of the surfaces decreases in the
order (111) > (110) > (100) and the relaxation
energy increases in the order (111) < (110) <
(100). Physically that is what one would ex-
pect—the defective type 3 (100) surface is unstable
and thus undergoes signiﬁcant rearrangements,
which results in a greater energy gain due to the
relaxation. The relative magnitudes of the surface

energies are in agreement with experimental obser-
vations that the (110) and (100) surfaces are less
stable than the (111) surface. The diﬀerence in sur-
face energy between the (110) and (100) surfaces
is smaller than the diﬀerence between these sur-
faces and the (111) surface.
While the ordering of the surface energies ob-
tained in the present work is the same as that
found in earlier studies, the magnitudes of the sur-
face energies are signiﬁcantly smaller than the val-
ues obtained using atomistic simulation [4,17,21].
The surface energies calculated with HF for the
(111) and (110) surfaces in [33] lie within the
range of values obtained in the atomistic simula-
tion studies. In [33] an a posteriori correlation cor-
rection was added using the functional of Perdew
and Wang and resulted in an increase in the sur-
face energies so that they lie slightly above the
atomistic simulation results. The present results
are similar to the results from Skorodumova
et al., also obtained within DFT [34]. A possible
explanation for the comparatively smaller DFT
surface energies could be due to the self-consistent
inclusion of electronic correlation eﬀects in the
DFT formalism.
Fig. 2 shows the ionic displacements perpendic-
ular to the surfaces after relaxation. Positive values
indicate that the ions relax out of the surface,
whereas negative values indicate a displacement
into the bulk. As the (111) surface is the most clo-
sely packed and stable surface, the relaxations
(Fig. 2a) are rather small. The overall eﬀect is an
inward shift of the surface layer. The atomic dis-
placements in this surface are smaller than those
using HF [33] and atomistic simulation [4,33].
The Ce–O distances around the surface layer con-
tract, but by no more than 0.01 A
˚ (0.5%).

For the relaxation of the (110) surface (Fig. 2b)
one can observe rumpling in the surface layer sim-
ilar to that seen for the (100) surfaces of rock salt
structured oxides [46]; while both ions are shifted
inwards, the inward displacement of the cerium
ions is notably larger than the displacement of
the oxygen ions. This is due to the charge on the
cerium atom causing it to be pulled into the bulk.
The (110) surface is the only surface which under-
goes lateral displacement. The oxygen ions are
shifted towards the nearest cerium ion in the same
layer, so that the extension of the bond-length due
to the vertical relaxation is compensated. The re-
sult is that the Ce–O distances in the surface layer
are 2.33 A
˚ (contraction of 1.7%), while in the sec-
ond layer, a contraction of 2.50% in the Ce–O dis-
tance is observed; the bulk Ce–O distances are
2.37 A
˚ . The displacements computed in the present
work are in agreement with HF results [33], and
smaller than those computed with the IP methods
[23,33,35].
The (100) surface undergoes the strongest
relaxations, Fig. 2c. The surface oxygen ions are
only two coordinate resulting in a large shift in-
wards and a contraction of 7.60% in the Ce–O dis-
tance directly below the surface vacancy. Each of
the other oxygen layers is split up—one half of
the oxygen ions are shifted out towards the sur-
face, while the other half (directly below the
surface oxygen) relaxes into the bulk. Moving in-
wards, we observe that contraction of the Ce–O
distances is less strong compared to that for the
surface layer; a contraction of 5.50% is found in
the second layer with the distances in the middle
of the slab close to bulk values.
In the following we analyse the electronic prop-
erties of the surfaces. The projected density of
states (PDOS) of the surface layers are displayed
in Fig. 3, along with the PDOS for the cerium
and oxygen atoms of the bulk. For the projection
onto spherical harmonics, we used Wigner–Seitz
radii of 1.5 A
˚ for Ce and O. For the (100) surface
we have plotted the atom and angular momentum
projected DOS of the surface layer together with
the total and projected DOS curve for bulk CeO2
(see Fig. 3). The low lying cerium 5s band found
at an energy of 33 eV is not included in the
plot.

10 eV below the valence band arises from interac-
tions between cerium 5p and oxygen 2s states. The
valence band is composed of predominantly oxy-
gen 2p states with a small admixture of Ce5d and
4f. Above the valence band we ﬁnd a narrow unoc-
cupied band derived from Ce4f. Finally, the con-
duction band is made up of Ce5d states. Note
also the presence of O2p states in the Ce5p/O2s
bands, presumably an artefact that is due to the
Wigner–Seitz radii used in the projection. The
O2p contribution to the unoccupied Ce4f band
on the other hand is probably real and may indicate
that ceria is not fully ionic. This is also indicated by
the presence of a Ce4f contribution to the valence
band DOS. The band-gaps of 1 eV between the va-
lence band and the Ce4f band and 5 eV between
the valence band the empty Ce5d band show the
usual underestimation of band gaps obtained from
DFT calculations; the experimental band gaps
taken from XPS spectra [28] are 3 eV and 6 eV.
A comparison of the projected DOS of the sur-
face layer and the DOS of the bulk shows that the
main changes occur in the valence states, those
being predominantly oxygen 2p. The change in
the DOS for the (111) and (110) surfaces com-
pared to bulk are very small with the largest
changes seen for the (100) surface, which also
undergoes the strongest relaxation. Due to the
low coordination number of 2 there is a destabili-
sation of the 2p states in the surface oxygen atoms,
which results in a shift of the 2p projected DOS to
higher energies, Fig. 3.
From the projection onto spherical harmonics,
the ionic charges can be obtained in the diﬀerent
layers of each of the surface slabs. This procedure
does not allow the absolute charge on the ions to
be determined and therefore we discuss qualita-
tively how the ionic charge is modiﬁed in the sur-
face compared to bulk. The charges in the bulk
are +2.72 on cerium and 1.49 on oxygen, sug-
gesting that ceria is not completely ionic. We ﬁnd
that the charges of the ions in the diﬀerent layers
in the slab diﬀer slightly from the values in the
bulk. It is only in the surface layer that any notable
change in the charge of the cerium and oxygen ions
is observed. The most stable surface, (111), shows
the smallest change from bulk, while the other two
surfaces display a relatively larger change in the
surface layer charges compared to bulk ceria.
For the (100) surface, we ﬁnd a charge of +2.61
on surface cerium and 1.34 on surface oxygen.
In succeeding layers, the charges are very similar
to the bulk charges.
We further investigate the electronic properties
using the electron density distribution. Fig. 4
shows the partial electron density of the semi-core,

valence and Ce4f states for the (100) surface. The
charge density plots conﬁrm that only the surface
layer displays any (small) change in the distribu-
tion of the electron density. We note that the
charge distributions in the surface layers are in line
with the contraction of the Ce–O distances in the
surface
layers
already
discussed.
The
partial
charge density in the energy range of the Ce4f
states for the (100) surface demonstrates clearly
that the Ce4f states above the Fermi level are in-
deed localised on the cerium atoms. Note also
the asymmetric density for the atoms in the surface
layer, compared to the more spherical distribution
for the atoms in the middle of the slab. This is due
to the asymmetric electric ﬁeld present at the sur-
face. The distortion of the 4f states at the surface
for the (111) and (110) surfaces is much weaker
compared to the (100) surface.
Before we consider defects in the (100) surface,
we brieﬂy demonstrate that the DFT+U approach
has little eﬀect on the properties of the pure (100)
surface. We ﬁnd that there is no modiﬁcation to
the surface relaxations and that the charge density
distributions and ionic charges are unmodiﬁed.
The only eﬀect of U that is of note is that the en-
ergy gap between the top of the valence band
and the empty Ce4f band is increased by 0.67 eV
over the GGA value.
3.2. Oxygen vacancies in reduced ceria
Since the exchange of oxygen between ceria and
the atmosphere is of signiﬁcant importance in the
application of ceria as an oxygen storage material,
we have studied oxygen vacancy defects in the
(100) surface. Upon reduction of ceria, CeIV ions
are formally reduced to CeIII, Eq. (1), and it is ex-
pected that these ions will be localised around the
oxygen vacancy sites.
For the present study, we consider the elec-
tronic structure of the partially reduced (100)
surface. To enable investigation of the oxygen
vacancy a 2 · 2 expansion of the pure (100) sur-
face was created with two vacancies, one on each
of the surfaces, thus ensuring that the slab has
no net dipole moment, Fig. 5. The slab thickness is
10.94 A
˚ , 9 layers. The same plane wave cut-oﬀ
energy (500 eV) and relaxation criteria (conver-
gence in the forces to less than 0.01 eV/A
˚ ) and a
2 · 2 · 1 k-point sampling mesh were applied.
In UPS studies [3,13] of the electronic structure
of partially reduced ceria surfaces, a new state is
found in the energy gap between the top of the va-
lence band and the bottom of the conduction
band, which is suggested to be due to partial occu-
pation of the Ce4f states, leading to formation of
CeIII [3,13].
The electronic structure resulting from GGA-
DFT gives rise to a DOS with no gap state be-
tween the valance band and the conduction band

with the Ce4f states crossing the Fermi level. The
partial charge density isosurfaces are displayed in
Fig. 6(a) and (b), illustrating that the Ce4f elec-
trons are delocalised over all the cerium atoms in
the simulation cell. This behaviour is not that ex-
pected for these electronic states and we conclude
from the lack of a gap state and the charge density
that GGA-DFT gives an incorrect description of
the electronic structure of reduced ceria. This ﬁnd-
ing is consistent with the work of Skorodumova
et al. [34] who showed that standard DFT is un-
able to describe correctly the localisation of cerium
4f states in fully reduced bulk ceria, Ce2O3.
In other materials, similarly localised states are
poorly described with standard DFT e.g. known
insulators are found to be metallic with states
crossing the Fermi level or an electronic hole is
delocalised instead of being localised [47].
To correctly describe the electronic structure of
the vacancy defect, we apply the DFT+U method-
ology [36], which is one approach to correct for the
inability of approximate DFT to properly describe
strongly localised systems [47]. Brieﬂy, due to the
fact that the self interaction of an electron is not
correctly cancelled in DFT, there is an artiﬁcial
barrier to electronic localisation, since the self

interaction is biased towards delocalising elec-
tronic states. The introduction of the on-site Cou-
lomb interaction, U, helps to remove some of the
self-interaction error, reducing the artiﬁcial barrier
to localisation, forming localised electronic states,
in agreement with experiment and contrary to
the GGA result. The actual value of U is usually
chosen to recover the correct value of an experi-
mentally measured parameter, e.g. the magnetic
moment or the band gap. For the present system,
this is diﬃcult, since we are dealing with a defect
state. In the present work, we use the PW91
GGA and choose a value of U that leads to local-
isation of two electrons in the Ce4f states for
each oxygen vacancy and an electronic structure
corresponding to that observed in experimental
UPS spectra [3,13]. Using values of U in the range
of 2–7 eV we have found that the degree of
delocalisation decreases with increasing U. For
U < 5 eV, signiﬁcant delocalisation still persists,
while for U = 5 eV and greater, the results are
essentially converged, in that localisation is found
to be essentially independent of the choice of U.
In this work, we use a value of U of 5 eV, which
is consistent with earlier work on cerium metal
[43].
The partial charge density from the DFT+U
electronic structure is presented in Fig. 6(c) and
(d) and demonstrates clearly the localisation of
the Ce4f electrons on the surface cerium atoms
neighbouring the oxygen vacancy. There is no
extension of these states onto the subsurface atoms
below the oxygen vacancy. The fact that the sub-
surface Ce atoms nearest the oxygen vacancies
are reduced is expected due to Coulombic interac-
tions. Fig. 7 shows the partial cerium density of
states of the oxygen vacancy defect (100) surface
calculated with DFT+U. Here, we observe the
appearance of a state in the previously empty
gap between the top of the valence band and the
unoccupied cerium 4f band. We note from the par-
tial charge density in Fig. 6(c) and (d) that cerium
4f electronic states are occupied in the gap state
PDOS peak and that the electrons are predomi-
nantly localised on the cerium atoms neighbouring
the oxygen vacancies; there is a small oxygen con-
tribution to the PDOS and the charge density in
the gap state.
The DFT+U approach results in an energy gap
of 0.90 eV from the top of the valence band to the
new Ce4f gap state and an essentially unchanged
band gap of 5 eV from the valence band to the
Ce5d conduction band. The band gap from the
valence band to the unoccupied Ce4f band is in-
creased to 2.1 eV compared to the pure surface.
The opening up of this band gap is not unex-
pected, given that the DFT+U formalism is ap-
plied to the Ce4f states and one function of U is
to shift up the energy of unoccupied states, i.e.
the unoccupied Ce4f states. The formation energy
of an oxygen vacancy in ceria was calculated with
GGA and DFT+U, see Eq. (1). With DFT+U, the
calculated vacancy formation energy is 4.55 eV,
which is a reduction of 0.83 eV from the calculated
GGA value of 5.38 eV.
Comparing the geometry of the defective sur-
face optimised with DFT+U to the geometry of
the pure (100) surface, we ﬁnd for the defective
surface that the Ce–O distances neighbouring the
vacancy are shortened by 0.60%. Relaxation of
the defective geometry with GGA-DFT results in
a geometry whereby the contraction of the Ce–O
distances is stronger compared to DFT+U. The
contraction of the Ce–O distance s neighbouring
the vacancy is 2.10% for the GGA-DFT geometry
compared to the contraction of 0.60% obtained in
the DFT+U geometry suggesting that GGA-DFT
overestimates contraction of the Ce–O distances
in the vacancy defect structure. The diﬀering

structures found for GGA-DFT and DFT+U are
consistent with the localisation of CeIII states and
demonstrate
the
importance
of
self-consistent
relaxations with DFT+U.
4. Conclusion
We have presented the results of DFT calcula-
tions of the low index surfaces of ceria. It has been
shown that the order of stability of the surfaces is
(111) > (110) > (100), while the extent of surface
relaxations is in the inverse order. The electronic
properties of the surfaces were studied through
the charges, the density of states and the charge
density.
The
investigation
of
ceria
surfaces
conﬁrms the presence of some covalent bonding be-
tween cerium and oxygen and the localised atomic-
like character of the unoccupied Ce4f electronic
states. Only the surface atoms show a signiﬁcant
change in the charge distribution in comparison
to the bulk. The main changes occur in the oxygen
2p and cerium 5d states of the surface atoms.
Reduction of the (100) surface was studied with
the introduction of oxygen vacancies. It was found
that application of GGA-DFT to this structure re-
sulted in delocalisation of the electronic hole over
all of the cerium atoms within the simulation cell.
Applying the DFT+U formalism (U = 5 eV), we
ﬁnd upon introducing oxygen vacancies:
(i) Only the Ce ions neighbouring the vacancy
are reduced from CeIV to CeIII, i.e. Ox
O þ
2Cex
Ce ! V
O þ 2Ce0
Ce.
The
charge
density
plots demonstrate that the electronic states
are localised on the two CeIII ions neighbour-
ing the oxygen vacancy site. The remaining
Ce ions remain in the unreduced CeIV state.
(ii) In the density of electronic states, a new peak,
due to the CeIII ions, appears in the previ-
ously empty band gap between the top of
the valence band and the unoccupied cerium
4f (CeIV) states.
(iii) In addition, use of the DFT+U formalism
results in diﬀerent structures compared to
GGA-DFT, consistent with the localised CeIII
species, indicating the importance of self-con-
sistent relaxation when applying DFT+U.
Thus, a modiﬁcation of DFT to correct for the
self interaction error, such as the DFT+U method-
ology is necessary for the determination of the nat-
ure of the electronic structure of defective sites in
CeO2.
