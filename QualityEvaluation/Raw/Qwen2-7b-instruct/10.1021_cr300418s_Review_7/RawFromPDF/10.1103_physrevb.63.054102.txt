The ‘‘classical’’ model of the @AlO4#0 defect center in irradiated quartz, an Al impurity having replaced a
four-coordinated Si atom, is that a hole forms in a nonbonding orbital of an oxygen atom, with consequent
asymmetric relaxation along that particular Al-O direction. This model has been proposed years ago, based on
the analysis of the electron-paramagnetic-resonance spectra of Al-containing crystalline SiO2 and analysis of
Hartree-Fock cluster model calculations. Three recent theoretical studies based on ﬁrst-principle density-
functional theory ~DFT! and band-structure plane-wave calculations proposed an alternative model where the
hole is completely delocalized over four oxygen neighbors to the Al impurity, at 0 K. Using cluster models
containing as many as 104 Si and O atoms and various theoretical approaches, we show that the delocalized
picture is an artifact of the DFT approach and that a fully localized hole is obtained when an exact treatment
of the exchange term is used. The validity of this conclusion is based on the direct comparison of computed
and measured quantities such as the 17O hyperﬁne and 27Al, 29Si superhyperﬁne coupling parameters, the 27Al
nuclear quadrupole effect, and the derivable local distortion around the defect. This work shows that great care
is needed when DFT is used to describe localized holes in insulators.

I. INTRODUCTION
Al-doped SiO2 has been studied in great detail, both theo-
retically and experimentally in the past four decades.1–14
Early experimental studies based on electron-paramagnetic-
resonance ~EPR! spectroscopy have shown that the defect
center corresponding to an Al atom substituting for a four-
coordinated Si atom in the lattice, the neutral @AlO4#0 center,
contains a hole trapped in a nonbonding 2p orbital of an O
atom adjacent to Al.1–3,6 The existence of a fully localized
hole at sufﬁciently low temperatures has been shown by the
accurate analysis of the EPR spectrum and in particular by
the determination of the hyperﬁne coupling constants with
the 27Al, 29Si, and 17O nuclides.6 Above room temperature,
the hole jumps rapidly among all four adjacent O atoms.
Cluster calculations performed at the Hartree-Fock level
have then conﬁrmed the model proposed based on the ex-
perimental data, showing the occurrence of the hole localiza-
tion at 0 K and the elongation of the corresponding Al-O
bond.9,10,12,13
This ‘‘classical’’ model has recently been challenged by
three theoretical papers based on advanced ﬁrst-principle
approaches.15,16,17 These studies were based on supercell cal-
culations with proper inclusion of boundary conditions and
density-functional theory ~DFT!. They all concluded that the
hole in the @AlO4#0 defect is completely delocalized over the
four O neighbors15–17 ‘‘in contrast to the phenomenological
model results’’ reported previously.16
Paramagnetic centers in pure and doped SiO2 play a major
role in determining the electrical properties of the material
and are of paramount importance for the elucidation of sev-
eral processes occurring in silicate glasses.18 Their impor-
tance is also connected to the proven possibility for use of
the highly sensitive EPR spectroscopy in combination with
other techniques ~such as optical absorption and photolumi-
nescence measurements! to identify the structure of point
defects.19 The theoretical description of these centers is of
great help for the correct assignment of an observed spectral
feature to a given structural defect.20 Therefore the contra-
dictory results reported in the literature about the nature of
holes associated to Al impurities in crystalline SiO2 open
questions which go beyond the simple scientiﬁc controversy,
and make the elucidation of the reasons for the different
answers given by the various theoretical methods of highest
priority.
In this study we have examined the electronic structure
and spin distribution in the @AlO4#0 center using cluster mod-
els of various sizes, as well as various ﬁrst-principle theoret-
ical methods. These range from unrestricted Hartree-Fock
~UHF! with exact treatment of the electron exchange but
neglect of electron correlation, to more sophisticated ap-
proaches where the exchange and correlation terms are de-
scribed in various ways. In particular, we explicitly included
correlation effects using second-order Mo
”ller-Plesset pertur-
bation theory ~MP2!. We compared these results with those
of DFT calculations or of hybrid methods where the HF
exchange is mixed in with the DF exchange or where the
exchange is treated at the HF level and only correlation is
included through a self-consistent DF treatment. The validity
of our theoretical results has been checked by comparing the
hyperﬁne coupling parameters computed at various levels
of theory with the corresponding experimental quanti-
ties.

analysis of the hyperﬁne and superhyperﬁne coupling param-
eters of the @AlO4#0 defect center. The results show the inad-
equacy of the DF method without self-interaction correction
in describing the hole localization in the @AlO4#0 center.
II. COMPUTATIONAL METHOD
The calculations have been performed within the cluster
model approach. The cluster dangling bonds have been satu-
rated with H atoms, and the positions of the cluster atoms
were initially ﬁxed to those of a-quartz at 94 K.21 The ﬁxed
H atoms provide a simple representation of the mechanical
embedding of the center within the solid a-quartz matrix.
The atoms were ﬁxed at a distance of 0.98 and 1.48 Å from
the respective O and Si atoms along the O-Si directions of
a-quartz. The positions of the Al, Si, and O atoms in the
electrically neutral cluster were then fully optimized. This
approach has been successfully adopted previously for the
study of the ground state and some excited states of point
defects in SiO2
22–29 and Si3N4.30,31 Note that in pure
a-quartz, each Si cation is surrounded by O anions, with two
bond distances: Si-O1,251.6101 Å and Si-O3,451.6145 Å, at
94 K;21 there is C2 local symmetry at the cation.
The clusters used to model the @AlO4#0 center are:
Al~OH!4, Al~OSiH3!4, Al@OSi~OH!3#4, and AlO60Si44H60, as
seen in Fig. 1. This latter structure has been computed with
the help of a mixed ab initio semiempirical approach ~see
below!. These clusters are terminated by either O-H or Si-H
groups; however, in our experience, this kind of ‘‘chemical
distinction’’ does not reﬂect in a different electronic structure
of the defect. The Al~OH!4 cluster has been used in previous
HF calculations,9,10,12,13 and yielded results very similar to
those obtained with larger clusters, and hence will not be
discussed in detail herein.
The cluster wave functions were constructed using the
following Gaussian-type atomic orbitals all-electron basis
sets: 6-3111G* on Al,32 6-31G* on Si,32 EPR-II ~Ref. 33!
on the four O atoms nearest neighbors to the Al impurity,
and 6-31G ~Ref. 34! on the other O atoms and on the termi-
nating H atoms. The EPR-II basis set has been speciﬁcally
designed to accurately compute hyperﬁne coupling ~HFC!
‘‘constants’’ for O atoms.33 Geometrical optimizations were
performed by computing analytical gradients of the total en-
ergy.
Unrestricted HF ~UHF! calculations were performed as a
reference. In HF theory, the energy has the form
EHF5ENUCL1^hP&1 1
2 ^PJ~P!&2 1
2 ^PK~P!&,
~1!
where ENUCL is the nuclear repulsion energy, P is the density
matrix, ^hP& is the one-electron energy including kinetic and
potential energy terms,
1
2 ^PJ(P)& is the classical Coulomb
repulsion term and 2 1
2 ^PK(P)& is the exchange energy re-
sulting from the quantum nature of the electrons. Notably,
the HF method does not include electron correlation, and in
principle this can lead to a different hole localization, or lack
thereof. Correlation effects have been included in two ways.
First we performed unrestricted MP2 calculations ~UMP2!
where electron correlation is treated by perturbation theory at
the second-order level. The second group of calculations has
been based on DFT. In the Kohn-Sham formulation of DFT,
the exact HF exchange for a single determinant is replaced
by a general expression, the exchange correlation functional,
which can include both exchange and electron correlation
energy terms:
EKS5ENUCL1^hP&1 1
2 ^PJ~P!&1EX1EC ,
~2!
where EX@P# is the exchange functional and EC@P# is the
correlation functional. In HF EX@P# is given by the exchange
integral 2 1
2 ^PK(P)& and EC50. Here we used three differ-
ent approaches: one based on the DFT formalism, and two
hybrid approaches where the exchange interaction is de-
scribed partially or totally by the HF exchange. In the pure
DFT scheme, we used the gradient-corrected exchange func-
tional proposed by Becke,35 combined with the nonlocal ex-
pression of the correlation functional proposed by Lee,
Yang, and Parr,36 denoted by BLYP. In one hybrid approach,
B3LYP, the HF exchange was mixed in with the DF ex-
change while the correlation was treated as in the previous
case ~LYP correlation functional!.36 For the exchange treat-
ment, we used the Becke approach37 where three parameters
were derived in order to accurately describe the thermochem-
istry of a set of molecules. In the last case, we used another
hybrid approach where the EX@P# term was completely re-
moved and the exchange interaction was described at the HF
~UHF! level while the correlation part EC@P# made use of

In the last of these, the Si atoms occur as 6 with no bonds to H ~as
is true also for Al!, 14 with one such bond, and 23 with two; the
black atoms are treated with a ﬁrst-principle Hamiltonian, the rest

proach is referred to as UHF/LYP in the following. All the
calculations are for open-shell structures and correspond to
nearly pure spin doublet states (^S2&50.7560.01).
The effect of long-range mechanical relaxation on the lo-
cal structure of the @AlO4#0 center has been studied by using
the ONIOM ~our own n-layered integrated molecular orbital
and molecular mechanics! method.38–41 The idea behind the
ONIOM approach is to partition a system into two or more
parts, where the most interesting part of the system is treated
at a ‘‘high’’ level of theory and the rest is described by a
computationally less demanding method. Here a cluster con-
taining 1 Al, 60 O, 44 Si, and 60 terminal H atoms has been
derived from a-quartz and divided into a ‘‘core’’ region in
which the defect is positioned and a surrounding ‘‘matrix.’’
The core has been described at the UHF, UHF/LYP, B3LYP,
and BLYP levels, while the matrix has been treated with the
semiempirical
medium

overlap
~MNDO! Hamiltonian.42 For the core region we considered
two sizes, AlO4 and Al~OSi!4, and we used the same basis
sets as described for the Al~OH!4 and Al~OSiH3!4 clusters.
Applications of the ONIOM method to the study of point
defects in insulators have been reported recently.43
The hyperﬁne interactions of the electron spin with the
nuclear spins of the 17O, 27Al, 29Si, nuclides have been de-
termined. The hyperﬁne spin-hamiltonian for each, HHFC
5S•A•I, is given in terms of the hyperﬁne matrix A which
describes the coupling of the electron with the nuclear spin.44

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Hartree-Fock and MP2 results
The electronic structure of the @AlO4#0 center has been
investigated with an Al~OSiH3!4 cluster. At the UHF level,
the ground state is characterized by the presence of an un-
paired electron localized in a nonbonding orbital of a bridg-
ing O atom. This is shown by the values of the spin popula-
tion, Table I, as well as by spin-density plots, Fig. 2. The
Al-O bond involving the hole-bearing O atom is substan-
tially elongated with respect to normal Si-O bonds in quartz
and to the other Al-O bonds of the center ~Table II!. In fact,
the computed Al-O distance is 1.96 Å, which corresponds to
an elongation of 17% compared to the other Al-O distances
~experimentally the elongation was estimated to be of the
order of 12%!.6 Furthermore, we found that the hole local-
izes preferentially on the O atom which corresponds to the
longer type of Si-O bond in quartz, as was experimentally
observed.6 Also the Al-O-Si angle changes and becomes
128° for the hole-bearing oxygen ion, 12° smaller than in the
corresponding cluster model of nondefective quartz. The
structural deformation is consistent with that found in previ-
ous cluster calculations9,12,13 and with that estimated from
EPR.6 The computed principal values ~A1 , A2 , and A3! of
the matrix A(17O) are 11.5, 13.6, and 2128.6 G, respec-
tively. The corresponding experimental values, 15.3, 17.9,
and 2111.0 G,5,6 are close to the UHF ones; the small dif-
ference is entirely due to the aiso value, 234.9 G in the
calculation and 226.0 G in the experiment, while the dipolar
interaction is reproduced with very high accuracy. The repro-
duction of an observable quantity such as the hyperﬁne cou-
pling parameters provides a strong validation of the model of
a fully localized hole. This result is in line with previously
reported UHF results for cluster models of the @AlO4#0
center9,12,13 and conﬁrms the picture originally proposed for
the paramagnetic Al impurity center in quartz. The analysis
of the spin population shows that the unpaired electron has
2.2% of 2s and 97.8% of 2p character, in qualitative agree-
ment with the estimates of Nuttall and Weil5,6 ~For a discus-
sion, see also Ref. 9!. In principle, however, the absence of
electron correlation effects casts some doubts on the validity
of this conclusion. In fact, electron correlation could lead to
a more pronounced delocalization of the hole, so that the
above-cited agreement could be fortuitous. To this end, we
have performed UMP2 calculations where correlation effects
are explicitly taken into account. Starting from the structure
of a-quartz with presence of an Al impurity ion, and reopti-
mizing the structure, we ﬁnd an elongation of the Al-O bond
and localization of the unpaired electron similar to the UHF
solution. The spin-population analysis shows that the hole is
completely localized; the value of the spin population on the
other O atoms around the Al impurity is 0.01 at most ~Table
I!. Also in this case we have determined the HFC parameters
for
17O; the resulting principal values ~11.4, 13.6, and
2128.8 G! are virtually identical to those obtained at the
UHF level.
The analysis herein of the hyperﬁne interaction has not
been restricted to the 17O nucleus. In Table I we also report
the A matrix for the coupling with the 27Al and 29Si nuclei of
the two atoms nearest neighbor to the hole-bearing O atom.
The results are compared with the values measured by Nut-
tall and Weil for Al-containing quartz.5,6 The agreement be-
tween theory and experiment is almost quantitative for Al,
while for Si the aiso is somewhat overestimated. The general
picture, however, is quite consistent with the experimental
spectrum. Also, the UHF and UMP2 results are virtually
identical. Thus no signiﬁcant differences in the description of

the electronic structure of the @AlO4#0 center are found after
inclusion of correlation effects at the UMP2 level, in this
case.
We also computed the electric-ﬁeld-gradient ~EFG! tensor
E evaluatable at any nucleus selected as provided by the
GAUSSIAN-98 code. For 27Al, the principal values calculated
with the cluster Al~OSiH3!4 are 20.669 553, 0.261 613,
0.407 940 a.u., while the principal values of nuclear quadru-
pole tensor P measured by EPR, using spin Hamiltonian
Hnq5I•P•I,44 are 0.037 56, 20.015 33, 20.022 23 mT.6
The relation between tensors P and E is
P5$2e2Q/@I~I21!4p«0geberB
3#%E,

where «0 is the permittivity of free space and rB is the Bohr
radius. We can adjust the ﬁrst member of the measured set,
normalizing with the factor 217.8262 a.u./mT, to equal the
ﬁrst of the computed set, yielding the set 20.669 553,
0.273 28, 0.396 28 a.u., which agrees nicely with the com-
puted set. Furthermore, the value of the nuclear quadrupole
parameter Q for 27Al obtained thereby is 10.134 barns, to be
compared with the literature value 10.150~6! barns.46 Thus,
with this physical property too, we see that the computed
ﬁxed-hole model simulates the experimental results very
well.
These results have been obtained with a cluster model of
medium size, i.e., one which includes the ﬁrst and second
neighbors to the defect Al atom. The model electronic struc-
ture of the @AlO4#0 center is very similar if one uses the
minimal model Al~OH!4, a model employed in previous
calculations.9,10,12,13 Going from the minimal to the medium-
sized cluster, we do not ﬁnd any qualitative difference in the
description of the hole localization or of the structural defor-
mation ~Table II!. Minor differences in the observable quan-
tities are primarily due to the presence of O-H replacing O-Si
bonds around the impurity. For instance, with the Al~OH!4
cluster, the HFC values show a slightly larger deviation from
experiment than with Al~OSiH3!4, but these differences do
not change the conclusions. The similar responses of the
Al~OH!4 and Al~OSiH3!4 clusters is one piece of evidence
for the highly localized nature of the defect.
To further bolster this conclusion, and in particular to
prove beyond any doubt that the asymmetric relaxation and

spin localization are not artifacts of the relatively small clus-
ters
used,
we
have
considered
two
larger
models:
Al@OSi~OH!3#4, where the next shell of 12 O third neighbors
to the Al impurity is included, and AlO60Si44H60, shown in
Fig. 1. In this latter case we used the ONIOM technique
described above. The results, Table II, fully conﬁrm the con-
clusions obtained with the smaller clusters. In particular, the
asymmetric distortion is also observed here with one Al-O
bond distance ~1.92 Å!, which is 14% longer than the other
ones ~the elongation estimated from EPR is 12%!.6 Even a
more quantitative analysis of the spin distribution and HFC
values does not show signiﬁcant deviations as one goes from
the minimal Al~OH!4 to larger models. Thus we can con-
clude that the hole localization and the corresponding asym-
metrical distortion are features which do not vary with the
cluster size.
The solution yielding the hole fully localized is not the
only minimum on the potential-energy surface of the
@AlO4#0 center. It has been discussed in the literature that a
thermally excited state of this center can be observed by
EPR,47 which is ca. 42 meV above the ground state, and
which contains the hole on the other type ~short-bond! of
oxygen atom. Self-consistent ﬁeld molecular orbital model-
ing of this state also has been accomplished,9 and agrees well
with the experimental ﬁndings. With the Al~OSiH3!4 cluster
and a UHF wave function, we found that the excited state
with the hole localized on the short-bond O atom lies 79
meV above the ground state. While this is extremely close to
the energy separation deduced from experiment, one has to
be cautious in attributing too much importance to this result,
given the small energy at stake and the lack of periodic
boundary conditions in our approach.
We have found still another state, one in which the hole is
delocalized over two O atoms, Table III. This structure is
characterized by two elongated Al-O bonds, but the whole
deformation is smaller than for that of the fully localized
hole. The second minimum is 1.60 eV higher in energy than
the fully localized hole ~UHF!. No attempt was made to cal-
culate the barrier which separates the two minima. Here the
hole is distributed over two O atoms of the short-bond type.
Not surprisingly, the modeled hyperﬁne structure of an un-
paired electron delocalized over two O atoms is substantially
different from that of the single hole-bearing O atom. This is
clear from inspection of the 17O HFC, and in particular of the
dipolar part ~Table III!. The computed A for the 27Al nucleus
differs substantially from the experimentally observed ma-
trix. The existence of a local minimum where the hole is
delocalized over two O atoms is not inconsistent with reality,
as it has been observed by 10 GHz EPR that at temperatures
.100 K the hole hops from one O atom to another at a rate
which is fast relative to the inverse EPR time scale at this
frequency.7,48
B. Density-functional theory results
Three recent papers based on a DFT supercell band struc-
ture approach come to the conclusion that the spin density in
the electronic ground state of @AlO4#0 at 0 K is evenly dis-
tributed over the four oxygens nearest neighbors to Al.15–17
This conclusion contrasts with the results described above
showing the presence of a localized hole. Several explana-
tions can in principle be proposed to explain the discrepancy:
~i! the inadequacy of the HF approach, due to the lack of
correlation effects; ~ii! a failure of the cluster model ~a pos-
sibility which is indeed mentioned in one of these papers!;16
~iii! an incorrect interpretation of the EPR spectra; ~iv! inad-
equacy of DFT. We have shown already that HF and corre-
lated calculations give the same results, so that hypothesis ~i!
can be discarded. Clearly, to establish which of the remain-
ing possible reasons is the correct one has an importance
which goes beyond the simple question of the electronic
structure of the @AlO4#0 impurity center. Therefore the elec-
tronic structure of the @AlO4#0 system has been recalculated
using the DFT approach and the same cluster models.
We consider ﬁrst the purely DFT BLYP approach with
the medium-sized cluster Al~OSiH3!4. Starting the optimiza-
tion from the structure of a-quartz, we found an energy mini-
mum where the hole is completely delocalized over four O
atoms, Fig. 2, in full agreement with the results obtained in
supercell DFT studies where periodic boundary conditions
are properly included.15–17 The Al-O bond distances com-
puted with the cluster model are all very similar, 1.75
60.01 Å, and only slightly longer than those reported in
other gradient-corrected DF calculations, 1.72 Å.17 We re-
peated the optimization starting from the UHF minimum
structure ~fully localized hole! but the calculation converges
to the same delocalized minimum found before. The calcu-
lations have been repeated for the whole series of clusters of
increasing size, and the hole delocalization is always found.
Actually, when we consider the Al~OSiH3!4 cluster at the
DFT/BLYP level we found a tendency to partially delocalize
the hole even on the next shell of O atoms, Table II. Low-

lying states of this kind have been found also in Ref. 16.
Thus local cluster models and periodic supercell calculations
give the same answer. Not surprisingly, the HFC values for a
system where the hole is delocalized are completely different
from those obtained for the fully localized case, and are in
gross disagreement with the experimental values ~Table I!.
We have repeated the calculations using the B3LYP ap-
proach where the HF exchange is partially mixed in with the
DFT exchange. The results are similar to, although not ex-
actly identical with, those obtained with the BLYP method.
In fact at the B3LYP level we found two states very close in
energy, one corresponding to a complete delocalization of
the hole over all four O atoms, and the other where the hole
is distributed over only two O atoms. In the ﬁrst case, the
spin population on two O atoms is 0.29 and on the other two
it is 0.21 and the four Al-O distances are similar, 1.77 Å
~Table II!. This state is slightly higher ~0.05–0.15 eV, de-
pending on the cluster used! in energy than a state with the
hole distributed over two O atoms. This suggests that the use
of a mixed HF-DFT exchange leads to a more pronounced
tendency towards a partial localization. The HFC values
~fully delocalized case! remain very far from the experimen-
tal ones. These results have been checked against cluster size
by computing the structure of the @AlO4#0 center with the
@Al„OSi~OH!3…#4 and AlO60Si44H60 clusters. As for the UHF
calculations, also at the B3LYP level no signiﬁcant change is
found as function of cluster size. The only difference is that,
by increasing the dimensions of the model, more conforma-
tional minima appear, leading to a more difﬁcult conver-
gence of the geometry optimization. This is true in particular
for the AlO60Si44H60 cluster where two different Hamilto-
nians are used, the DFT one for the core and the MNDO one
for the matrix. Since the MNDO method is a simpliﬁed HF
approach, and because of the implementation of the ONIOM
technique which requires the calculation of the ‘‘core’’ part
at both levels of theory, MNDO and DFT, we are in the

presence of an opposite tendency: the MNDO Hamiltonian
tends to localize the hole, the DFT one tends to delocalize it,
and the result is an oscillatory behavior in one of the calcu-
lations for which convergence in the optimization has not
been achieved ~Table II!.
At this point, we considered a second hybrid approach
where the exchange is treated exactly ~HF exchange!, and
correlation is treated with the LYP functional, see UHF/LYP
in Table I. The method has been applied only to the
Al~OH!4, Al~OSiH3!4, and Al@OSi~OH!3#4 models, Table II.
In the ground state, the hole is found to be fully localized and
the results are extremely close to those obtained at the UMP2
level. The computed HFC values are virtually the same as in
UMP2 and in close agreement with the experiment. We also
found a second minimum, with the hole distributed over two
O atoms ~Table III!, at an energy of 1.67 eV above the
ground state ~1.60 eV in UHF!. This result shows unambigu-
ously the importance of the exact exchange for the descrip-
tion of a localized hole in @AlO4#0. The failure of the DFT
method in this case is probably due to the afore-mentioned
problem: the self-interaction correction.49 The HF energy
contains no self-interaction contributions because the self-
interaction part of the Coulomb energy cancels that of the
exchange part. This requirement cannot be satisﬁed in DFT
without special efforts. Because of the self-interaction, in
DFT the unpaired electron tends to delocalize over many
atoms to reduce the Coulomb repulsion.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The ﬁrst model structure of an @AlO4#0 center in a-quartz
was proposed almost 50 years ago by O’Brien.2,3 It consists
of ‘‘an unpaired electron in a localized orbital on one of the
four nearest O atoms.’’ This model was reﬁned by Nuttall
and Weil in 1981.6 In a careful analysis of the relevant EPR
spectrum of Al-doped quartz at 35 K, they determined the
hyperﬁne coupling parameters for 27Al, 29Si, and 17O, de-
spite the very low natural abundance ~0.037%! of the oxygen
isotope.6 The spin-Hamiltonian parameters that they derived
conﬁrmed the original assignment of the signal to an Al atom
substituting for a four-coordinated Si cation with an unpaired
electron located in a nonbonding O orbital.6 Furthermore,
they established that the trapping oxygen is of the type which
would have a ‘‘long’’ bond in quartz, relative to Si~Al!.6
These experimental ﬁndings have then been corroborated by
four ab initio studies based on small-cluster models and ab
initio Hartree-Fock wave functions.9,10,12,13 In all these stud-
ies a full localization of the hole has been observed, consis-
tent with the O’Brien model.2,3
The picture of a fully localized hole in @AlO4#0 centers
has been brought into question by three recent band-structure
calculations performed at the DFT level.15–17 In particular,
the last of these studies17 ~which includes gradient correc-
tions! represents a considerable improvement in the level of
theory compared to the previous ab initio cluster calcula-
tions. In fact, gradient-corrected DFT combined with a su-
percell approach where periodic boundary conditions are in-
cluded is generally considered to provide very accurate
answers for solid-state problems. From these three studies, a
completely different picture emerged. In fact, it is found that
the hole in @AlO4#0 is completely delocalized over four O
atoms.15–17 It is somewhat surprising that in two of these
studies15,17 the previous literature on the subject has been
ignored and that no attempt was made to compare the new
with the old results. In the work of Magagnini et al.,16 on the
other hand, this comparison was done and the ‘‘classical’’
model was discarded as a ‘‘phenomenological’’ one in favor
of the new model of a delocalized hole. It is also surprising
that these conclusions have been reached without computing
any physical observable, but were simply based on theoreti-
cal arguments.
In the present work, we have shown that the two different
physical pictures emerging from cluster HF and from super-
cell DF calculations have nothing to do with the model used
~cluster or supercell! but rather are due to the nonexact treat-
ment of exchange in DFT and to the well-known problem of
the self-interaction correction. Correlation effects, explicitly
included in a post-HF approach through perturbation theory,
do not change the picture obtained at the HF level of a fully
localized hole. On the other hand, the use of the DF ex-
change, even when mixed with the HF exchange in a hybrid
HF/DFT approach, leads to the incorrect picture of a delo-
calized hole. The inadequacy of the delocalized model is
shown by the direct comparison of the hyperﬁne matrix, a
physical observable. In some of the previous ab initio stud-
ies, the isotropic part of the hyperﬁne interaction was
computed.13 Here we have reported a theoretical analysis of
the dipolar parameters. The agreement between the com-
puted and measured values is almost quantitative for the
‘‘classical’’ model, while it is very poor for the ‘‘delocal-
ized’’ model. It is worth mentioning that the ‘‘classical’’
picture is consistent also with dielectric relaxation and
acoustic-loss experiments50–52 suggesting that the Al center
hole can jump between different O atoms under an applied
electric ﬁeld, a fact which is not easy to reconcile with the
‘‘delocalized’’ description.
In conclusion, we have shown that the ‘‘classical’’ model
of an Al impurity center in SiO2 is correctly described by
high quality ﬁrst-principle calculations, provided that a
proper treatment of the exchange is done. Speciﬁcally, care
is necessary in the use of DFT for the study of localized
holes in insulators. We note that no excitonic or vibronic
effects were invoked in our modeling.
