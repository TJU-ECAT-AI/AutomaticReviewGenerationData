Abstract
Most metals are oxidized under ambient conditions, and metal oxides show
interesting and technologically promising properties. This has motivated
much recent research on oxide surfaces. The combination of scanning
tunneling microscopy with ﬁrst-principles density functional theory–based
computational techniques provides an atomic-scale view of the properties
of metal-oxide materials. Surface polarity is a key concept for predicting
the stability of oxide surfaces and is discussed using ZnO as an example.
This review also highlights the role of surface defects for surface reactivity,
and their interplay with defects in the bulk, for the case of TiO2. Ultrathin
metal-oxide ﬁlms, grown either through reactive evaporation on metal sin-
gle crystals or through oxidation of metal alloys (such as Al2O3/NiAl), have
gained popularity as supports for planar model catalysts. The surface oxides
that form upon oxidation on Pt-group metals (e.g., Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt) are
considered as model systems for CO oxidation.

1. INTRODUCTION
Surface science is the study of solid surfaces under well-controlled conditions—usually single
crystals and often in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), i.e., in a background pressure in the range of
10−10 mbar. Since its inception in the late 1960s, surface scientists have developed techniques that
allow insights into the atomic-scale properties of solid surfaces with exquisite precision (1). The
invention of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and its offspring, atomic force microscopy,
has especially broadened the reach of the ﬁeld. Real-space images with atomic resolution are now
routinely achieved with commercial instruments and, in combination with area-averaging spec-
troscopic techniques, allow one to obtain a truly atomic-scale picture of clean surfaces, and their
modiﬁcation with adsorbed entities. In lockstep with these experimental advances, computational
approaches have been developed, in particular ﬁrst-principles calculations based on density func-
tional theory (DFT). New functionals (2–4) have improved the accuracy of theoretical predictions,
and in combination with the expansion of computing power and efﬁcient, user-friendly codes (5),
sufﬁciently large systems can now be modeled so that theory has become invaluable in interpreting
experimental data and often guides experiments.
During the past 15 years or so, there has been a shift in the type of systems that surface scientists
have investigated: Whereas the initial focus was predominantly on metals and semiconductors,
there is a growing body of work that deals with metal-oxide surfaces, the topic of this review.
It is easy to see why one would want to study metal-oxide surfaces. After all, almost every metal
is oxidized in the ambient. Hence it is often the surface of the oxide, rather than that of the metal
itself, that deserves our interest. In addition, the range of physical and chemical properties of bulk
oxide materials is overwhelming. Among metal oxides are superconductors and the best insulators;
some oxides are inert enough to act as corrosion protection layers, whereas others are chemically
active as catalysts. Some of the most interesting magnetic, optical, and electronic properties are
found within this class of materials. Not surprisingly, oxides are at the heart of many established
and emerging technologies, and, in many instances, their surfaces or their interfaces with other
materials are key to device functioning. Understanding the surface properties of oxides—their
geometric and electronic structure, their reaction with adsorbed entities such as molecules or
nanoparticles, and the formation of interfaces—is of key interest in many technological areas.
Metal-oxide surfaces are inherently complex systems: Often they can assume a variety of stoi-
chiometries, and even for one particular chemical composition several structural phases can exist.
Defects in various forms are prevalent, which adds to their complexity. In fact, the development
of sample preparation procedures for appropriate model systems was one of the major roadblocks
that had to be overcome before the surface science of metal oxides could develop into the bur-
geoning ﬁeld it is today. The systems being investigated can roughly be divided into three classes.
The ﬁrst class contains oxide single crystals, cut or cleaved to expose surfaces of various crystallo-
graphic orientations. Most of the bulk oxides that have been thoroughly investigated to date [e.g.,
TiO2 (6), ZnO (7), and SnO2 (8)] have a band gap of approximately 3 eV and are semiconductors,
owing to doping with either intrinsic defects (e.g., oxygen deﬁciencies in reduced TiO2 samples)
or impurities [e.g., hydrogen in ZnO (9)]. Many important oxides are good insulators (e.g., Al2O3,
SiO2, or MgO), which hampers the applicability of most experimental surface techniques. Often,
these are then synthesized as ultrathin ﬁlms, i.e., with a thickness of a few atomic layers. Ultrathin
oxide ﬁlms represent the second class of materials that has been investigated quite extensively. Last,
but not least, the oxide that forms on top of the metal itself is of high interest. This is especially
true for catalytically relevant late transition metals. On their surfaces, it can be the surface oxide,
rather than adsorbed oxygen on the bulk metal, that is the catalytically active phase in oxidation
reactions.

Rather than presenting a comprehensive review of all the different systems and phenomena
that have been investigated and discovered, we discuss a few fundamental concepts that have
emerged as important. We do this by using some of the most investigated and best-understood
model systems as examples.
In the ﬁrst part of this review, we use ZnO as an example of how to consider an oxide structure
from a surface point of view. We introduce the concept of surface polarity, which is useful for
judging whether a surface is likely stable. It has been recognized early on (10) that defects determine
much of the interesting properties of oxide surfaces. In particular they play important roles as
adsorption and reaction sites for molecules. These include surface oxygen vacancies, hydroxyls,
and line defects such as domain boundaries and step edges, as well as excess cations in the subsurface
regions, which may diffuse to the surface at elevated temperatures. STM, as a probe for local
electronic structure, is an ideal tool for investigating surface defects. We discuss this aspect in the
second part of this review, using the TiO2(110) surface as an example. We then turn our attention
to ultrathin metal-oxide ﬁlms. These form naturally when a reactive metal is exposed to oxygen,
but only in rare circumstances do the resulting oxides become well ordered, ﬂat, and epitaxial. For
better structural and compositional control, ultrathin metal-oxide ﬁlms are often synthesized on
metallic substrates through evaporation/oxidation, or via oxygen-induced segregation on metal
alloys (often used to prepare aluminum oxides on Al-containing alloys). These ultrathin oxide ﬁlms
do not necessarily have the same structure as their bulk counterparts. The same basic building
blocks are certainly present, however. Even more importantly from a physical chemistry point of
view is that the electronic properties are greatly affected by the underlying metal substrate; hence
the reactivity is not the same as their bulk counterparts, and they may exhibit unique properties.
The next section of this review is devoted to the oxidation of late transition metals that are
important for catalysis. The structure and stability range of two-dimensional surface oxides, and
whether these represent the active phase in the oxidation of CO, are brieﬂy discussed. We then end
with a brief outlook of issues that are expected to be even more relevant in the future—for example,
more complex (e.g., doped) oxides and the evolving, rich, and interesting ﬁeld of perovskites.
2. ZINC OXIDE: EXAMPLE FOR A BULK OXIDE AND POLAR SURFACES
Our ﬁrst example is ZnO, a material of signiﬁcant importance in catalysis and optoelectronics.
It is a wide-band-gap (3.2-eV) semiconductor, and single crystals are readily available. A good
overview of the surface chemistry of ZnO has been given by W¨
oll (7). Interestingly, ZnO can also
be grown in the form of nanostructures (11) with fascinating shapes. These small single crystals
have well-developed facets, and their promising and exciting properties are often surface-driven
or -dominated.
Cox (12) presents a good introduction to the bulk properties of transition metal oxides. Most
metal oxides are predominantly ionic in their structural features (12). The bulk lattice con-
sists of (formally) doubly ionized O2−anions, surrounded by metal cations. The ionic radius of
O2−is much larger than that of the cations, and the oxygen sublattice typically forms a hexago-
nally close-packed structure with either an fcc or an hcp-type stacking sequence. The metal cations
then reside in the interstices of the close-packed oxygen layers, most often in an octahedral or a
tetrahedral conﬁguration, i.e., with either sixfold (6c) or fourfold (4c) coordination, respectively.
Alternatively, one can also picture the bulk structure as comprising such octahedral and tetrahedral
units that connect in various ways, sharing an edge, a side, or a corner. The example discussed here,
ZnO, crystallizes in the wurtzite structure (Figure 1a). The oxygen sublattice forms hexagonally
closed-packed layers with hcp-type stacking, and the Zn ions are located in tetrahedral interstices;
the tetrahedral units are corner sharing (Figure 1a).

(a) Schematic of the wurtzite crystal structure of ZnO, which can be viewed as a stack of hexagonally
close-packed layers of oxygen atoms (running in the vertical direction), with zinc atoms in tetrahedral
interstices. The top layer represents the nonpolar ZnO(10¯
10) surface; it contains threefold coordinated O
and Zn atoms. The (000¯
1) and (0001) planes at the left and right sides, respectively, represent the polar ZnO
surfaces. They contain exclusively O (left) and Zn (right) surface atoms. As shown in panel b, such a crystal
with uncompensated polar surfaces can be viewed as a sequence of capacitors with surface charges σ, which
results in an internal ﬁeld that diverges with crystal thickness and leads to an energetically unstable situation.

Creating a surface always costs energy, and the minimization of the surface free energy is
what drives the energetics of virtually every system. For ionic compounds such as metal oxides,
surface polarity is a key concept. T
asker (13) ﬁrst discussed the surface stability of ionic crystals
in a seminal article. A more reﬁned and complete review was provided by Noguera (14) and was
recently updated by Goniakowski et al. (15).
Based on purely electrostatic arguments, T
asker classiﬁed the surfaces of ionic crystals into
three types. He viewed the lattice as comprising charge-neutral layers that lie parallel to the
surface and argued that an energetically unstable situation would result if the dipole moment of
such a stacking sequence does not vanish.
T
ype 1 surfaces consist of layers of mixed stoichiometry. These layers carry no dipole moment,
and the resulting nonpolar surfaces are often quite stable. For example, the top layer of the ZnO
structure in Figure 1a [the (10¯
10) plane] contains an equal amount of Zn and O ions and has no
dipole moment. Indeed, the ZnO(10¯
10) surface is the lowest-energy facet of a ZnO crystal (16).
We note that the surface Zn and O atoms on ZnO(10¯
10) are both threefold coordinated (3c),
providing adsorption sites for molecules. For example, water adsorbs strongly at this surface (17).
The oxygen atom of the water molecule is bound to a Zn3c atom, and a dative hydrogen bond to
an undercoordinated surface O atom provides additional stabilization.
T
asker type 2 surfaces comprise trilayers containing the same total number of positive and
negative charges, but with an excess of one type of charge on each side of the trilayer structure.
This results in two opposing dipole moments, which cancel each other. The resulting surfaces
are also often quite stable; the classic example is the CaF2(111) structure, which, for an oxide, is
manifested in CeO2(111). The TiO2(110) surface discussed in the context of Figure 3 (discussed
in Section 3) is such a T
asker type 2 surface.
Type 3 or polar surfaces consist of stacks of bilayers, each one with a dipole moment. For
example, the ZnO structure can also be viewed as parallel layers of O anions and Zn cations. In

Figure 1a these layers run in the vertical direction (the structure terminates with an O layer on
the left-hand side and a Zn layer on the right-hand side). Indeed, each ZnO crystal that is cut
parallel to the basal plane has two surfaces with distinctly different chemical properties (18).
An (0001)-oriented ZnO crystal plate with Zn termination, referred to as a ZnO(0001)-Zn
surface, at one side and O termination, ZnO(000¯
1)-O, at the opposite side can be viewed as a
series of charged capacitors, as sketched in the equivalent circuit diagram in Figure 1b (14). The
electrostatic potential, and thus the self-energy of a crystal with ionic charges, would diverge with
thickness. Instead, type 3 polar surfaces undergo a stabilization, which provides a macroscopic
depolarization ﬁeld (14). The form of the stabilization mechanism strongly depends on the sys-
tem (15). For the case of the ZnO(0001)-Zn surface, many small, triangular islands and holes
form (Figure 2a) (19, 20). These islands have a height of half a unit cell (2.6 ˚
A), and each step
edge contains only oxygen atoms. This provides excess negative charge on the Zn-terminated

surface and stabilizes the surface for a wide range of oxygen chemical potentials (20). On the
ZnO(000¯
1)-O surface, a different stabilization mechanism is operational. The surface is ﬂatter;
the islands are hexagonal; and most step edges are one unit cell high (5.2 ˚
A) and contain both Zn
and O atoms (Figure 2b). There are strong indications that a (1×1) terminated ZnO(0001)-O
surface is fully covered with hydrogen (7, 21). It was also suggested that a clean, hydroxyl-free
ZnO(0001)-O surface exhibits a (1×3) reconstruction, although this issue has remained controver-
sial (22). As pointed out by Goniakowski et al. (15, 23), the rules for surfaces polarity compensation
are lifted in the case of ultrathin ﬁlms and nanostructures. Indeed, ultrathin ZnO ﬁlms grown on
Ag(111) have a depolarized, ﬂat (graphitic) structure (24).
Clearly, the stabilization mechanism dramatically affects the surface chemistry of the polar
ZnO surfaces. For example, the cation-anion pairs at the many step edges on the ZnO(0001)-Zn
side provide active sites for the dissociation of Brønsted acids (25, 26), and a fully hydroxylated
(1×1) ZnO(000¯
1)-OH surface is quite different from an H-free (reconstructed) one.
3. TITANIUM DIOXIDE: EXAMPLE FOR SURFACE AND BULK DEFECTS
Our next example is TiO2, more speciﬁcally the (110) surface of rutile, the thermodynamically
most stable structural TiO2 polymorph. Diebold (6) reviewed the surface science of TiO2 in 2003,
and Pang et al. (27) present a more recent account, focusing exclusively on the surface chemistry
of TiO2(110). The TiO2(110) surface has received signiﬁcant attention in the surface-science
literature. Again, it is the versatility of this material, and the multitude of its applications [e.g.,
in photocatalysis (28)], that makes its surfaces so interesting. Surface-science studies have also
been motivated by the fascinating observation that nanosized Au clusters are capable of catalyzing
oxidation reactions at low temperatures (29). TiO2 is the prototypical support for such nanostruc-
tured Au clusters, and it is a challenging and rewarding puzzle for surface scientists to disentangle
how each component of the system—the cluster (e.g., its size, shape, and electronic structure),
the support, and the interface between the two—contributes to the catalytic process. TiO2 is rel-
atively easy to handle experimentally, which has contributed considerably to its popularity as a
model system. Many vendors provide rutile single crystals, and standard UHV sample prepara-
tion procedures (i.e., sputter-cleaning with rare-gas ions and annealing) can be used to prepare ﬂat
surfaces with wide terraces. This treatment results in an oxygen-deﬁcient (or Ti-rich) bulk, easily
recognized by a color change from transparent-yellowish to blue (30). On the one hand, this pro-
vides a considerable practical advantage, as reduced samples have high electrical conductivity and
are amenable to all surface analytical techniques involving charged particles. On the other hand,
the fact that the bulk contains defects that might migrate to the surface needs to be considered
when studying the surface properties of TiO2 (30–33).
A model of the TiO2(110) surface is shown in Figure 3a. It terminates in a (1×1) structure with
some relaxations as predicted by DFT calculations and as conﬁrmed by recent diffraction studies
(34, 35). The surface consists of rows of Ti5c atoms, running along the [001] direction, separated
by twofold coordinated (or bridge-bonded) surface O2c atoms. (Although O3c atoms also reside
on the selvedge, they are not considered surface atoms as they have the same coordination as in
the bulk.) The Ti5c atoms act as (Lewis) acid sites for the adsorption of lone-pair molecules and
the O2c atoms as Brønsted bases, which can accept an H atom from an adsorbate.
The STM image of the TiO2(110) surface shown in Figure 3b was taken in the constant-
current mode by tunneling into empty states. This imaging mode is typical for n-type semicon-
ducting oxides. The bright and dark lines along the [001] direction are located at the position of
the Ti5c and O2c sites, respectively. The image contrast is dominated by electronic effects: The

conduction band consists mostly of Ti states, and the Ti5c atoms appear higher in the STM, even
though they do not stick out of the surface as far as the O2c atoms (Figure 3a) (36). STM is, after
all, a technique that foremost probes the local electronic structure.
On vacuum-prepared TiO2(110) surfaces, a few percent of the bridging O2c atoms are typically
missing. The resulting vacancies appear as the (fainter) bright spots on the dark rows in STM.
That O vacancies can be observed so readily, and that defect-mediated reactions can be monitored
directly with atomic-scale resolution (37–40), is one of the attractive features of TiO2 as a model
system for surface reactions. For example, water dissociates at the vacancies, resulting in two
hydroxyls (37–42) as shown schematically in Figure 3a. [It seems that these two hydroxyls should
be equivalent, although STM results indicate a different diffusivity (40).] The OH groups usually
appear a little brighter than the O vacancies in STM images (38). It has long been known that
water adsorbs on TiO2(110) with a sticking probability of unity up to very high temperatures (43)
and that good vacuum conditions are needed to observe nonhydroxylated O vacancies. This fact,

which was pointed out early on (42, 44), has been overlooked in some cases (45), leading to much
initial confusion about defect motion and chemistry on TiO2 (45, 46).
Defects modify the electronic structure of TiO2. This can clearly be observed with spectro-
scopic techniques, for example, in the photoemission spectrum in Figure 3c. The binding energy
scale in Figure 3c is referenced to the Fermi level (EF), which is located close to the lower
edge of the conduction band in this n-type semiconductor. The valence band maximum is lo-
cated at approximately 3 eV, consistent with the band gap of TiO2. [The exact position of the
valence band maximum depends on the photoemission geometry in this indirect semiconductor
(47).] The feature at approximately 1-eV binding energy, a Ti-3d-derived (48) band gap state,
is only present on nonstoichiometric TiO2 surfaces. When such a slightly defective surface is
exposed to water at room temperature, the gap state increases a little in intensity and shifts to
somewhat higher binding energies. Features that are indicative of surface hydroxyls appear as
well, i.e., the 3σ state at approximately 11-eV binding energy and a 1π state within the valence
band.
It seems quite straightforward to interpret the gap state as coming from O vacancies and hydrox-
yls on the clean and water-dosed surface, respectively. There have been some recent controversies
about this assignment, however (49, 50). Based on DFT with the revised Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof
functional (51), it has been claimed that O vacancies do not cause a gap state, and that Ti intersti-
tials, residing in the near-surface region, are responsible for the gap state and for surface chemical
reactions observed with STM (49). In these authors’ opinion, it is probably both O vacancies and
Ti interstitials that contribute to this state. DFT calculations using standard functionals do not
show a clearly separated band gap feature and tend to delocalize the extra electrons across the slab
rather than localizing it at the position of the O vacancy. The difﬁculties of treating correlation
effects in metal oxides with standard DFT have been pointed out by Ganduglia-Pirovano et al.
(52). Calculations using Hartree-Fock or hybrid DFT methods result in a gap state for both an O
vacancy and a hydroxylated O2c atom (53).
As brieﬂy mentioned above, that Ti interstitials reside in the TiO2 lattice has long been recog-
nized as an important feature of TiO2 surface chemistry. In a series of elegant experiments, using
isotopically labeled Ti and O, Henderson (54) demonstrated that Ti interstitials diffuse much
more readily than O vacancies. This has to be considered, for example, when reduced TiO2 is
annealed in an oxygen atmosphere (31–33), in which reoxidation processes can result in metastable
surface structures or in other oxidation reactions that occur at somewhat elevated temperature
(55). It is good to see the renewed interest in this issue.
Several interesting aspects of TiO2 surfaces deserve further investigation. For example, the
structure of another rutile surface orientation, the TiO2 (011)-(2×1) surface, has recently been
resolved (56, 57). This surface is quite stable with a fairly low surface energy. With a large unit cell
and high corrugation, it is well-suited for STM studies (58). Different from the TiO2(110) surface,
TiO2(011)-2×1 is hydrophobic in the absence of defects (59); hydroxyls nucleate the growth of
one-dimensional, H-bonded water clusters. That linear arrays of O vacancies can be produced by
electron bombardment (60) should be an attractive feature for controlling defect-mediated surface
chemistry at the atomic level.
The anatase polymorph of TiO2 is also a promising subject for further surface investigations
(61). Anatase is used in most technical applications, and most nano-TiO2 is of the anatase form.
Interestingly, the surface oxygen vacancies that are so prevalent on rutile tend to migrate to
subsurface sites on TiO2 anatase (101) (62, 63). This could be particularly relevant for defect-
mediated surface chemistry, as subsurface vacancies may survive in ambient conditions, outside of
a vacuum chamber. Also, important adsorbates such as water form unique and interesting structures
(64) on TiO2 anatase (101).

4. ULTRATHIN OXIDE FILMS
4.1. Reactive Evaporation
Ultrathin metal oxides have been produced by vapor deposition of a metal on an appropriate
(mostly metallic, and often refractory) single-crystalline substrate and by oxidation of the resulting
overlayer either during or after deposition. Ideally, this produces an epitaxial ﬁlm that has a known,
reproducible structure and that is thin enough to avoid charging problems in STM and surface
spectroscopies. Metal nanoclusters are often deposited on top of these ultrathin metal-oxide ﬁlms,
and the resulting samples are used as planar model catalysts (65). The supported nanoclusters are
again grown by simply vapor depositing a metal—the low surface energy of most metal oxides
and the low interface energy (weak binding) between the oxide and late transition metals lead to
the formation of three-dimensional clusters. Systems include MgO (66, 67) and SiO2 (68), as well
as many transition metal oxides such as iron oxides (69), titanium oxides (70), vanadium oxides
(71–73) (Figure 4), and cobalt oxides (74). For a more extensive discussion, the reader is referred
to several excellent review articles on this topic (e.g., see 65, 71, 75, 76).
Many different oxide phases and structures are formed upon reactive evaporation; such phases
can often coexist. This is especially true for transition metals, which are stable in various oxidation
states. Some phases are similar to bulk structures, whereas others exist only as ultrathin ﬁlms
and may exhibit special electronic or magnetic properties. In addition to the exact preparation
parameters (e.g., temperature, O2 pressure, and growth rate), the substrate is also important; the
same metal-oxide ﬁlm, prepared with similar experimental parameters, often exhibits a different
structure depending on the type of metal used. A nice example is vanadium oxides, which have
been investigated extensively by the Netzer group (71, 72) (see Figure 4).

Recently, it has been pointed out that a key difference between ultrathin ﬁlms and bulk oxides
is the facile charge transport through the ﬁlms via tunneling. For example, in ultrathin MgO ﬁlms,
adatom energy levels are shifted with respect to the same adatom on the bulk oxide (67, 77, 78).
This charge transfer does not occur instantaneously; it has been argued that the timescale is on
the order of 10−15 s or longer (79).
4.2. Alumina on NiAl
In addition to reactive deposition, the oxidation of metal alloys has been used as a convenient
way to form ultrathin metal-oxide ﬁlms. With a formation enthalpy of 1676 kJ mol−1 (5.79 eV
per oxygen atom), α-Al2O3 (corundum) is one of the most stable oxides. It is responsible for
the corrosion resistance of the otherwise highly reactive Al metal. Oxidation of pure Al does not
produce any well-ordered oxide ﬁlms (80), but a smooth alumina ﬁlm was found after oxidation
of a NiAl(110) alloy surface at elevated temperatures (81, 82). The resulting ultrathin ﬁlm has
been used in numerous surface and model catalysis studies (75, 76, 79). Its structure was solved
by a combination of STM and DFT (83) (Figure 5). It is only ≈5 ˚
A thick and consists of four
layers: an interfacial Al layer (Ali), an oxygen layer (Oi), a layer of Al atoms (Als) directly above
the Oi atoms, and ﬁnally the surface oxygen layer, Os. Although all bulk structures of alumina
consist of (distorted) hexagonally close-packed O layers, the Os atoms in the ultrathin alumina
ﬁlm are arranged in squares and triangles. The short-range order in the ﬁlm is similar to the bulk
oxide, however: T
ogether with the Oi atoms below, the Os triangles form tetrahedra around the Als
atoms. The Os squares can be viewed as truncated octrahedra, each with an Als atom close to the
center (Figure 5b). Oxygen octahedra and tetrahedra are building blocks of various polymorphs
of aluminum oxide, whereas, in corundum, all Al atoms are octahedrally coordinated. This is one

of the recurring motifs in ultrathin oxides: The structure is different from any bulk phase but
comprises the same building blocks.
The ultrathin alumina ﬁlm has a stoichiometry of Al10O13; in the literature these ﬁlms are
nevertheless often referred to as Al2O3. Although the ﬁlm seems oxygen deﬁcient at ﬁrst glance,
it has a large band gap of ≈6.7 eV (84), not too different from the one of bulk Al2O3 (9 eV),
indicating a stoichiometric oxide. Based on DFT calculations, one can argue that the Ali atoms are
not fully oxidized. Their pz2 orbitals bind to the substrate, and thus their formal valency should be
considered Al2+; this renders the whole oxide charge neutral (83). With a stacking of Al2+
4 –O2−
6 –
Al3+
6 –O2−
7 , the alumina ﬁlm has a net dipole moment; in contrast to thick materials, this does not
pose a problem for such an ultrathin ﬁlm (15). Frequently found line defects (domain boundaries)
in this oxide are oxygen deﬁcient. This deviation from charge neutrality results in band gap states
as well as band bending (85). These line defects act as preferred nucleation sites for the growth of
supported nanoclusters (see Figure 5d ).
In contrast to many of the ultrathin oxides on Pt-group metals discussed in the next section,
an ultrathin alumina ﬁlm is not thermodynamically stable (86). It owes its existence to kinetic
limitations: The ﬁlm cannot grow in thickness because molecular oxygen from the gas phase does
not dissociate on the oxygen-terminated surface. Further oxidation can be accomplished by oxygen
dissociation on metal clusters grown on the oxide ﬁlm. The atomic oxygen spills over (87) onto the
oxide, and a thicker oxide ﬁlm forms (88). In addition to NiAl(110), similar ultrathin aluminum
oxides have been found to form on Ni3Al(111) (89–91), Cu91Al9(111) (92), and probably NiAl(100)
(93). In all these alloys, Al is combined with a less reactive metal that has a higher melting point.
The slow supply of Al, as it diffuses to the alloy surfaces, is an important ingredient for forming
these well-ordered ultrathin oxides.
The growth of, and chemical reactions on, alumina-supported clusters was studied extensively
as models for catalysts (75, 76, 79, 94). For room-temperature deposition, the clusters of most late
transition metals form at defect sites of the ultrathin alumina ﬁlms. Clearly, surface diffusion of
adatoms is fast enough to ﬁnd a defect (heterogeneous nucleation) before enough adatoms meet
to form a stable cluster on the perfect surface (see Figure 5d for an example of nucleation of Pd
at line defects). A notable exception is Pt, which forms a large number of nuclei (79), as do more
reactive metals that bind strongly to oxygen, e.g., vanadium (95). An alumina ﬁlm on Ni3Al(111)
represents a particularly nice example of how heterogeneous nucleation can be used to produce
a well-deﬁned planar model catalyst (90, 91, 96). This ﬁlm contains a hexagonal arrangement of
holes with a separation of 41 ˚
A. These holes act as nucleation sites for metal clusters; with vapor
deposition, equidistant clusters form with a narrow size distribution. Whereas ultrathin alumina
ﬁlms represent convenient and useful model systems for heterogeneous catalysis, one has to be
aware of the limited thermal stability of some supported clusters. Nickel diffusion through the
oxide ﬁlm into the metal substrate was observed at temperatures as low as 480 K (97); Co clusters
are stable only up to ∼600 K (98).
5. SURFACE OXIDES OF PLATINUM-GROUP METALS AND CATALYSIS
One of the long-time goals of surface science, honored by the award of the 2007 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry to Gerhard Ertl, is a better understanding of catalysis. The oxidation of CO on
Pt-group (Group VIIIb) metals is possibly the most-investigated catalytic reaction in surface
science. CO oxidation serves as a model for more complex reactions, and it also has technological
relevance for the puriﬁcation of automotive gas exhaust. The reaction COads + Oads →CO2 is
deceivingly simple. Nevertheless, recent work has pointed out that, rather than combining an
adsorbed CO with an O adatom on the metal surface, oxidic species may play a decisive role.

Structure of the surface oxides on (a) Pd(111) and (b) Rh(111). A Pd5O4 unit is marked in panel a and the upper layer in the bottom-
right corner of panel b is removed to show the stacking. (c) Density functional theory–calculated surface phase diagram of the Rh(111)
surface as a function of the chemical potential of oxygen, μO (based on 122). For conversion from μO to experimental parameters, one
can use the upper x axis and a scale bar corresponding to a change of pressure by a factor of 10 at 700 K. The most stable structures with
increasing μO are two oxygen adatom phases, ﬁrst with a (2×2) structure and then a (2×1) structure, followed by Rh2O3. The trilayer
surface oxide depicted in panel b is only metastable but stabilized by kinetic effects.
For more reactive metal catalysts, such as Ru, a (bulk-like) RuO2 oxide layer forms under high-
pressure conditions, and the CO is oxidized by the oxygen from the RuO2 surface in a Mars-van-
Krevelen mechanism (99). (That RuO2 does not form under UHV conditions led to the puzzling
observation that Ru, which is a very active catalyst under atmospheric conditions, is nonreactive at
low pressures.) For the more noble metals Pd, Pt, and Rh, an ultrathin surface oxide forms under
conditions at which the catalyst is most active (100–105). Such a surface oxide does not necessarily
resemble a bulk phase but may have its own, unique structural features. The exact structure of
surface oxides, the range of their stability, and whether the surface oxide or a layer of adsorbed
oxygen layer is catalytically most active are contentious issues to this day (106, 107).
Lundgren et al. (108) have reviewed the surface oxides on close-packed late transition metals.
Shown in Figure 6a,b are two prototypical structures. For Pd, strictly two-dimensional, almost
ﬂat layers form (109–112). Figure 6a illustrates the surface oxide of Pd(111) (109). It has a Pd5O4
stoichiometry, and, similar to the alumina case discussed above, it is different from the bulk oxide,
PdO. The Pd atoms in this structure are accessible to gas-phase species; hence CO can adsorb
(113). On low-index Rh surfaces, conversely, so-called trilayer surface oxides form (114–116) (see
Figure 6b). These consist of three close-packed layers: a lower (interfacial) O layer, an Rh layer
within the oxide, and an O layer at the top. The termination with such a close-packed O layer
makes Rh surface oxides inert (at least at the low pressures compatible with UHV experiments);
it has been shown that the reduction of the surface oxide starts at defects and proceeds at the
boundary between reduced areas and the surface oxide (117, 118).
The stability range of surface oxide phases can be assessed using ﬁrst-principles thermodynam-
ics (119, 120); Figure 6c shows the surface phase diagram for Rh(111) as an example. Plotted is
the (generalized) surface energy obtained from DFT calculations as a function of oxygen chem-
ical potential μO, which is a function of the oxygen pressure pO2 and temperature T. For each

structure, the surface energy depends linearly on μO and is derived in the following way: The
slope of the line is given by the oxygen coverage, and μO at the intercept with the (horizontal)
line for the clean metal surface equals the O adsorption energy. For each μO value, one particular
structure has the lowest surface energy; this is the one that will form in thermodynamic equilib-
rium. [Entropy effects typically play a minor role (121) and are not considered in Figure 6c and
similar surface phase diagrams.] The phase diagram in Figure 6c predicts that the most stable
structure consists of O adatoms with a coverage (θ) of 0.5 monolayers for chemical potentials
between −1.54 eV and −1.25 eV. For more O-rich conditions, with chemical potentials higher
than −1.25 eV (to the right of the vertical line in Figure 6c), the bulk Rh2O3 structure is the most
stable one. We note that the trilayer surface structure, which is observed experimentally (Figure
6b), is not a thermodynamically favored structure at any value of μO, but a kinetically limited phase
(114, 122). Such surface phase diagrams can also be extended for cases in which several gases are
present [e.g., O2 and CO (120)] and can predict phases under reaction conditions that are often
not accessible in surface experiments.
The discovery of surface oxides, together with the development of surface-science techniques
that can operate under reactions at realistic (high) pressures, has motivated further studies of CO
oxidation on Pt-group metals. It was discovered that high activity for CO oxidation on Pt, Pd, and
Rh coincides with the presence of ultrathin oxides (100–105); similar conclusions were also drawn
from X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements of real catalysts (123). In contrast, molecular-
beam experiments in UHV show a higher catalytic activity for the oxygen adatom phase than for
the surface oxide on Pd(111) (124). For other Pt-group metals, there are also indications that the
highest activity occurs at an oxygen coverage below that of surface oxides (106, 107, 125). These
results are not necessarily contradictory, however. At high μO, oxygen adatom phases are often
not stable (e.g., see Figure 6c); thus even if these would be the more reactive phase, they may not
form at high (atmospheric) pressures and moderate temperatures. CO-saturated metal surfaces
are inactive because they block O2 adsorption, so it is possible that a surface oxide remains as the
only phase with appreciable reactivity. Furthermore, DFT calculations suggest a high reactivity at
the boundary of surface oxides (126), which may be especially important for oxygen-terminated
surface oxides, such as the ones found on Rh surfaces. The dispute about these questions is far
from settled, however.
6. OUTLOOK
Much of the research reviewed here has been motivated by the desire to better understand—and,
ultimately, design—heterogeneous catalysts. The increase in the consumption of the world’s nat-
ural resources and the related environmental problems will only intensify the search for more
efﬁcient and selective catalysts (127). Oxides have long been recognized as an important compo-
nent of catalysts, as a support that often critically affects functioning (128, 129), as well as the active
component itself. Many important issues have been addressed, but even more remain open—for
example, whereas (intrinsic) surface defects have received extensive attention, dopants and impu-
rities (which, after all, are most often used to functionalize technical materials) are comparatively
unexplored at the atomic/molecular scale (130). The synthesis of ultrathin metal-oxide ﬁlms has
opened the fascinating opportunity of producing nanostructures with intriguing geometries and
potentially interesting properties, but these samples might have limitations in mimicking an in-
sulating support. Thus there is a push to reﬁne experimental methods that allow the monitoring
of fully insulating systems. Ideally measurements are performed in operando, i.e., under realistic
pressure/temperature conditions, and with a time resolution that allows the observation of the dy-
namic changes of the catalyst. Clearly, more complex systems need to be explored, without losing

the control provided by UHV-based studies of reductionist, simple systems. Moving from metals
to oxides has represented an important step in surface-science research; moving from simple to
more complex oxides needs to follow in both theory and experiment.
The surface-science community has rallied around a few, select metal oxides, and has made great
strides in understanding their atomic-scale properties. There is still a knowledge gap, however,
for many materials that are interesting and important in their own right, but have not been
explored in depth. T
o judge which surface phenomena are materials speciﬁc and which ones can
be generalized, it is necessary to broaden the numbers and kinds of systems that are studied with
the same thoroughness as, say, TiO2. SnO2, for example, also has the rutile structure but is not
a transition metal oxide. A key consideration for the stability of tin oxide surfaces and step-edge
structures (8, 131) is that the cation is only stable in two oxidation states, an aspect that is not
relevant for TiO2.
An important class of materials, for physical chemists, materials scientists, and condensed
matter physicists alike, is the perovskite-type oxides. They ﬁnd diverse applications, for example,
in solid oxide fuel cells, or in devices based on their piezoelectric, ferroelectric, superconducting, or
magnetoresistive properties. The richness of their physical properties has provided a platform for
much exciting research in condensed matter physics and offers unique opportunities for surface
science (132, 133). Many of the fascinating phenomena of these materials are interface driven
(134), and there is still much to be learned about the surface properties of these systems (135). For
example, the key role of surface preparation, central to more chemistry-oriented research, is often
not enough appreciated (136). Yet it should be even more important in complex, multicomponent
materials, in which properties sensitively depend on the details of the system.
SUMMARY POINTS
1. Most metals are oxidized in the ambient, and metal-oxide materials have a large range
of physico-chemical properties, which makes them useful for many applications. In vir-
tually all of these, surfaces play a role. This motivates surface-science studies of well-
characterized metal oxides, with a reproducible, known structure.
2. Defects on metal oxides affect the local structural and electronic properties and are often
chemical reaction centers. With local probes (such as STM), chemical reactions at the
atomic scale can be visualized.
3. Polar oxide surfaces have a nonvanishing dipole moment and are intrinsically unstable.
Although they can be stable as ultrathin ﬁlms and nanostructures, various stabilization
mechanisms are at work for thicker materials.
4. Ultrathin oxide ﬁlms, formed by oxidation of a metal overlayer on an appropriate sub-
strate, or through oxygen-induced segregation of one component (e.g., Al) of an alloy,
can have structural and electronic properties that are quite different from their bulk
counterparts. When decorated with metal nanoclusters, such ultrathin oxide ﬁlms are
useful as planar model catalysts.
5. First-principles thermodynamics based on DFT calculations that account for the chem-
ical potential of the gas phase are useful for predicting the stability range of metal-oxide
phases.
6. In catalytic oxidation processes, the surface oxides of late transition metals (platinum
group) play an important role, although many open questions remain.
