Abstract
In this study a series of CeO2 powders with surface area in the range of 10–140 m2/g were prepared by calcination at increasing tem-
peratures of samples of polycrystalline ceria and used as catalysts for CO oxidation under a free diffusion limitation regime. It was found
that aging under air of polycrystalline ceria samples, regardless of the preparation method used, caused the rearrangement of crystallites,
with loss of surface area and exposure of more reactive surfaces, which increases the speciﬁc activity in CO oxidation. HRTEM analysis has
shown that the treatment under oxygen at temperatures greater than 773 K results in the truncation of the sharp tips between two {111}-type
surfaces, exposing new and more reactive surfaces of the {100} type. In accordance with previous theoretical calculations and with recent
studies on monodimensional ceria samples, a correlation between exposure of these surfaces and an increase in speciﬁc reaction rate was
found.

1. Introduction
Cerium dioxide is a key component in the formulation
of several commercial catalysts. Its major use is as a pro-
moter in the catalysts used for reducing CO, hydrocarbons,
and NOx emissions from gasoline engines, where it acts
as an oxygen storage/release medium that is continuously
reduced and oxidized under cycling feedstream conditions
[1,2]. A complex series of redox reactions occurs on the ce-
ria surface in the presence of lean/rich gas mixtures, which
involve continuous formation and annihilation of oxygen va-
cancies and changes in the redox state of cerium (IV/III). CO
oxidation is one of the key steps in the overall process, and
therefore it has frequently been used as a probe reaction over
ceria-based materials to evaluate different catalyst formula-
tions and investigate mechanistic issues [3–7]. It is generally

accepted that CO oxidation under stationary conditions oc-
curs over pure ceria by a Mars–van Krevelen-type mecha-
nism, where reaction involves alternate reduction and oxida-
tion of the ceria surface with formation of surface oxygen va-
cancies (as the key step) and their successive replenishment
by gas-phase oxygen. Therefore an understanding of the
structure and relative stability of the surfaces of CeO2 can
provide useful insights closely related to catalytic reactions
that normally take place on these surfaces. A few theoretical
studies have investigated the structure and relative stability
of surfaces of CeO2, and the results have indicated that the
compact {111} surfaces are the most stable (and are there-
fore less reactive), followed by {110}, {100}, and {211}
[8–10]. It has recently been reported that materials with
1D-like morphology speciﬁcally prepared to predominantly
expose these planes are more reactive than conventionally
prepared cerium oxide in CO oxidation [11]. Although in
this case comparison of activity has been made on the ba-
sis of light-off curves only, it was shown that 1D materials
in the form of nanorods exposing {100} and {110} planes

have a higher reactivity toward CO oxidation. Unfortunately,
nanocrystalline ceria powders predominantly expose their
least reactive {111} surfaces, and preparation of polycrys-
talline materials with preferential exposure of speciﬁc reac-
tive planes is very difﬁcult. A correlation between sample
morphology and overall catalyst performance has also re-
cently been reported for samples of mesoporous ceria [12].
It was found that the conversion of different catalysts (mea-
sured by comparing T50 in light-off curves) against surface
area has a maximum in the range of 900–1000 K, and this
was correlated with changes in the morphology and in the
characteristics of pore structure of the samples.
The work presented here further proceeds along these
lines, by widening the investigation to the determination of
speciﬁc activity under controlled kinetic conditions and by
using different sets of starting materials with the aim of ex-
tending our conclusions to ceria powders, regardless of the
preparation methods used. It was found that aging under air
of polycrystalline ceria samples caused the rearrangement of
crystallites, with loss of surface area and exposure of more
reactive surfaces, which increases the speciﬁc activity in CO
oxidation. However, because of the lower surface area of
samples, the overall activity on a per-gram basis is lower.
Other factors that can positively inﬂuence speciﬁc activity
on large ceria crystallites are also discussed.
2. Experimental
Three different high-surface area samples of polycrys-
talline ceria powders were used as starting materials through-
out this study. They were prepared according to different
methods and are designated as CA, CB, and CC. Fresh CA
sample (surface area 143 m2/g) was prepared by moder-
ate calcination (473 K) of cerium carbonate obtained from
Ce(NO3)3 by precipitation with NH4HCO3. CB was pre-
pared according to a process that involves the precipitation
of a homogeneous acidic solution of cerium nitrate with a
base. The ﬁlter cake is then washed with distilled water, fol-
lowed by spray drying and calcination at 573 K. CC is a
commercial sample of “stabilized ceria” prepared by a pro-
prietary method and calcined at 773 K. The purity of samples
was checked by chemical analysis; CA and CB samples had
a purity greater than 99.8%, and the purity of the CC sam-
ple was greater than 99.4%. Main impurities for all samples
were lanthanide oxides (La, Pr, Nd, Sm), alkaline earth ox-
ides (CaO, MgO), and SiO2. Traces of Na and Cl were also
found.
We treated freshly prepared samples under air in a tubular
furnace at different temperatures (up to 1073 K for a period
of 2 h) in order to prepare a series of catalysts with increasing
crystallite size and decreasing BET surface area. Textural
and morphological properties of samples are summarized in
Table 1. For brevity, samples are indicated followed by their
calcination temperature: for example, CA calcined at 973 for
2 h is indicated as CA973.

BET surface area and pore size distribution were evalu-
ated from the adsorption isotherm with a Sorptomatic 1990
porosimeter.
Structural features of the catalysts were investigated by
X-ray diffraction. Spectra were recorded on a Philips X’Pert
diffractometer (equipped with a real-time multiple strip de-
tector) operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, with Ni-ﬁltered Cu-Kα
radiation. Spectra were collected with a step size of 0.02◦
and a counting time of 40 s per angular abscissa in the range
of 20–145◦. Rietveld reﬁnement of the XRD pattern was per-
formed by means of a GSAS-EXPGUI program. The mean
crystallite size was estimated from the full width at half-
maximum with the Scherrer formula.
TG analysis was carried out with a Q500 thermobalance
(TA Instruments) under an air ﬂow. Microstructural char-
acterization by high-resolution transmission electron mi-
croscopy (HRTEM) was carried out with a JEOL 2010F
instrument equipped with a ﬁeld emission gun, which made
it possible to achieve a point-to-point resolution of 0.19 nm
and a resolution of 0.14 nm between lines. Samples were de-
posited directly on holey carbon-coated grids.
Catalytic activity measurements were carried out in a
steady-state glass micro ﬂow reactor (Φ = 6 mm, L =
300 mm) operated in a temperature range of 300 ⩽T ⩽
1100 K, with a total ﬂow of 0.1 l/min. Typical feed condi-
tions were as follows: CO (2%), O2 (1%), and N2 as diluent,
with a GHSV of ca. 2 × 105 h−1. Analysis of CO, O2, and
CO2 was carried out under continuous conditions with an
on-line infrared analyzer (ABB Uras-14 for CO, CO2) and
a paramagnetic O2 analyzer (ABB Magnos-106). We col-
lected conversion-versus-temperature curves (light-off pro-
ﬁles) by increasing the temperature at a rate of 10 K/min
and monitoring conversion. Rate of CO oxidation has been
determined at low conversion by assuming differential re-
actor conditions (i.e., conv. <5%); accuracy of rate values
is within 15%, as determined by repeated measurements at
ﬁxed temperature. Reaction conditions were chosen to mini-
mize the effect of mass and heat transfer phenomena. The

absence of external and internal diffusion limitation was
conﬁrmed by experiments. We checked limitations in exter-
nal transfer phenomena by measuring conversion at increas-
ing W/F (catalyst weight/total ﬂow) ratio and maintaining
constant space velocity. A series of runs carried out under
these conditions did not indicate any variation in conver-
sion, thus ruling out any limiting effect of external diffusion
phenomena. The absence of strong resistance to internal dif-
fusion was determined by evaluation of the activation energy
for the reaction in the temperature range investigated as re-
ported in the following sections.
3. Results
3.1. Structural and textural properties
Powder X-ray diffraction data conﬁrm in all samples the
presence of crystalline CeO2 as the only detectable phase.
The formation of a cubic ﬂuorite lattice of Fm3m symme-
try is always detected, with almost identical cell parameters.
For CA samples a slight modiﬁcation of cell parameter is
observed after calcination at lower temperatures (Table 2),
indicating the likely presence of some Ce3+ in samples
with smaller crystallite size. This also agrees with the lat-
tice expansion that has been observed in the ﬂuorite-type
lattice constant of CeO2/CeO2−x nanoparticles in the size
range of 2–8 nm due to the presence of Ce3+ (either resid-
ual Ce3+ due to incomplete oxidation of oxide precursors
and/or Ce3+ due to structural/quantum conﬁnement or other
physico-chemical effects [13]). For CB and CC samples lat-
tice constants agree with a full CeO2 stoichiometry at all
calcination temperatures, in agreement with their crystallite
size larger than 8 nm.
The average crystallite size as shown in Table 1 increases
continuously with calcination temperature due to sintering.
In accordance with this, larger particles display progres-
sively lower BET surface area, which decreases continu-
ously with temperature. Isotherms of type IV were obtained
for all samples. From an examination of pore size distribu-
tion curves it can be concluded that for samples CA and CB,
the largest area contribution is from pores less than 120 Å in
diameter, whereas larger pores are found in sample CC re-
gardless of calcination temperatures. Microporosity is absent
in samples with a BET surface area lower than ca. 80 m2/g.

rings in the ED pattern is also included and indexed according to the Fm3m
CeO2 structure.
3.2. Surface morphology and exposed planes
Surface morphology of samples was investigated by
transmission electron microscopy techniques. All samples
displayed similar characteristics (sample CA was more dif-
ﬁcult to study because of the presence of aggregates of
ceria particles that were poorly resolved); we will com-
ment here on images related to sample CB in the so-called
fresh state (calcined at 573 K), after calcination at “low
temperature” (CB773) and after calcination at “high tem-
perature” (CB1073). TEM and electron diffraction analysis
of the three samples revealed that they are constituted by
CeO2 crystallites. For fresh sample, electron diffraction pat-
terns recorded in selected-area mode (SAED) in several
regions show smooth rings, which indicate that the sample
is polycrystalline and is constituted by very small crystal-
lites. As a representative example, Fig. 1 shows an aggregate
and its corresponding SAED pattern along with an inte-
grated intensity-spacing proﬁle. The reciprocal spacings of
the electron diffraction pattern and their relative intensity
conﬁrm cerium dioxide as the only crystalline phase. High-
resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM) was
used to accurately calculate the size of the crystallites by
lattice-fringe analysis. The distribution of crystallite size is
very homogeneous and is centered at ca. 7–8 nm, compared
with a value of 10 nm calculated from XRD (Table 1).

It has been possible to characterize CB773 and the sam-
ple oxidized at 1073 K at the atomic scale by HREM over
a large number of individual CeO2 crystallites (more than
30 crystals for each sample). By identifying the lattice spac-
ings and particle orientation, we determined the facets on the
particle surfaces. Because of the agglomeration of particles,
caution was taken to distinguish between lattice fringes of
the same crystal and those originating from crystal overlap-
ping.
Fig. 2 shows various individual, representative CeO2
crystals in the CB773 sample (a–d). All of the crystallites
are oriented along the [011] crystallographic direction. The
labeling of the crystal planes for each particle is indicated
in the ﬁgure. It is deduced that the dominant lattice fringes
in all cases correspond to the {111} family, at 3.12 Å. The
sharp faces of the CeO2 crystals have very few surface steps
and consist of symmetry-related {111}-type surfaces. The
shape of most particles is compatible with an octahedron en-
closed by eight {111} planes (Figs. 2a and b). These crystals
exhibit also sharp tips, with only a few cerium atoms at the
narrowest point. In addition to {111} planes, some particles
of the fresh sample also exhibit {100}-type surfaces. This
is illustrated in the crystallites depicted in Figs. 2c and d,
where, in addition to {111} planes, there is also the presence
of (200) planes at 2.71 Å. Occasional steps with {111}-type
nanofaceting are indicated by arrows in Fig. 2d.
Typical images from the CeO2 crystallites in the sample
oxidized at 1073 K are displayed in Figs. 3a–d. Again, all of
the crystallites are oriented along the [011] crystallographic
direction. In these samples the CeO2 crystallites probably

cles are oriented along the [011] crystallographic direction, showing {111}-
and {100}-type facet structures.
agglomerate by minimizing the interface energy with the for-
mation of a lattice-matched coherent interface [14], which
may explain the observed distribution of crystallites with a
preferred orientation of [011]. In this case, extensive {100}
facets are encountered in addition to {111} planes. The treat-
ment under oxygen results in the truncation of the sharp tips
between two {111}-type surfaces along the perpendicular
[100] crystallographic direction, originating the (200) planes
depicted in Fig. 3. This is consistent with the truncated octa-
hedral shape of the crystallites, which is the new surface of
the {100}-type.
3.3. Catalytic tests
A representative series of curves showing the effect of
calcination temperature on CO conversion under stationary
conditions over CA samples is presented in Fig. 4. A typi-
cal smooth light-off behavior is observed; the shape of the
curves shows that conversion is negligible at low temper-
ature (T < 500 K), and in all cases investigated the onset
of activity starts at 500–600 K, with total conversion ap-
proached at ca. 750 K for most samples. Overall activity on a
per-gram basis follows the inverse order of calcination tem-
peratures, where the sample calcined at high temperatures
is the least active (i.e., activity of CA473 > CA573 > ··· >
CA1073).
We made an accurate determination of speciﬁc activity
by measuring the rate of CO oxidation at low conversions
(from the conversion-vs.-temperature curves), assuming dif-
ferential reactor conditions, under a kinetically controlled
regime. The advantage over a measurement carried out by

evaluation of T50 only is the possibility of calculating the
speciﬁc turnover rate, which excludes the contribution of
surface area to the measured values. In addition, the rate is
measured under a kinetic regime, since conversion at T50
is sometimes inﬂuenced by diffusion and mass-transfer phe-
nomena [15]. Fig. 5 displays rate data against crystallite size;
the overall picture is now more clear; speciﬁc activity shows
a marked dependence on the crystallite size, regardless of
the preparation history of the sample. Particularly in the size
range from 10 to 40 nm, the activity is strongly dependent on
crystallite size, whereas the increase in activity for particles
larger than 40 nm seems to reach limiting values, at least for
samples CA and CB.
4. Discussion
The oxidation of carbon monoxide over CeO2-based ma-
terials under aerobic and anaerobic conditions has been the
subject of intense investigation in recent years [6,16–19].
It is generally accepted that the prevalent mechanism in-
volves a redox Mars–van Krevelen-type reaction in which
CO reacts with surface ceria, forming an oxygen vacancy,
which is then replenished by gas-phase oxygen. Formation
and desorption of CO2 complete the cycle. The presence of
carbonate-like adsorbates as intermediates before CO2 des-
orption is a possibility, especially under cycled feedstream
conditions [3,6,20,21]. It is in fact reported that carbonate-
like or inorganic carboxylate-like complexes of CO are
formed on a CeO2 surface when it is exposed to a CO at-
mosphere [22–24]. In addition, it is also known that the ad-
sorption behavior of CO on ceria surfaces is strongly related
to the nature of the surfaces used in the experiments [25]; in
Fig. 5. Speciﬁc rate of CO oxidation calculated at 543 K against crsyatllite
size for CA (2), CB (Q), and CC (") samples.
particular, whereas only weak adsorption has been predicted
for the {111}-type surface, both weak and strong adsorption
is detected on the {110}-type surface, giving rise to carbon-
ate formation. The different reactivity of CO with exposed
surfaces of ceria is also the result of the different stabilities
of exposed planes. It is known from the theoretical molec-
ular mechanic method that the stabilities of three low-index
planes in the ceria ﬂuorite cubic structure follow the order
{111} > {110} > {100} [8–10,26], with the consequence that
formation of anionic vacancies is easier in {110} and {100}
surfaces. Therefore, since less energy is required to form an
oxygen vacancy on these surfaces, it is much easier to ac-
commodate here reaction with CO. The main consequence
of this ﬁnding is that the redox reactivity of ceria (espe-
cially toward CO) might strongly depend on the type and
amount of surfaces exposed to the gas phase. As a matter of
fact, it has recently been demonstrated that nanorods pref-
erentially exposing the unusually reactive {100} and {110}
planes have a lower light-off temperature for CO oxidation
than their counterpart irregular nanoparticles [11].
In polycrystalline ceria the situation is much more com-
plex, since preferential exposure of different planes is difﬁ-
cult to control, although it has been found that ceria surfaces
consisting exclusively of {111} lattice planes, upon anneal-
ing at 1073 K, form a well-deﬁned portion of {100} sur-
faces [27]. Changes in surface morphology and in the pore
structure were also recently shown to be the origin of dif-
ferent activities of samples of mesoporous ceria [15]. Also
in this case, the activity data are compared by evaluation
of T50 in light-off curves carried out at different space ve-
locities, and the shape of light-off curves cannot exclude
an effect of mass transport limitation within pores, which
poses a few limits on the generalization of the conclusions
reached in this investigation. Our study reveals that pref-
erential exposure of speciﬁc surfaces upon treatment under

oxidizing conditions is found also in pure crystalline ceria,
regardless of the preparation method used. Although mea-
sured on a qualitative basis, this ﬁnding is supported by
the large (and statistically signiﬁcant) number of individual
crystallites that were examined. The above HRTEM studies
indicate that CeO2 particles after calcination at high temper-
ature expose, in addition to {111} planes, well-deﬁned and
less stable {100} planes, whereas in CeO2 not subjected to
high temperature treatments, the most stable {111} planes
are predominantly exposed. In addition, at calcination tem-
peratures above 773 K, the change in exposed surfaces re-
sults in an increase in speciﬁc rate of CO oxidation.
The observed increase in speciﬁc reaction rate value upon
calcination might be the consequence of several physico-
chemical modiﬁcations of the surface of ceria crystallites.
We will try to present evidence here that there is a relation
between preferential plane exposure and increase in CO ox-
idation rate, and at the same time we will attempt to exclude
the presence of other phenomena.
We have found that the strong surface area loss that fol-
lows calcination is always accompanied by an increase in
mean particle diameter and average pore size. This can af-
fect intra- and extra-particle diffusion resistance. In particu-
lar, resistance to internal pore diffusion in high-surface area
particles would have the effect of reducing the apparent spe-
ciﬁc reaction rate in materials that have a relevant fraction
of surface area constituted by micro pores. The overall ef-
fect would be an increase in speciﬁc reaction rate after high
calcination temperatures, due to a drop in internal pore dif-
fusion. A quite general and simple method for excluding any
intra-particle diffusional limitation is the calculation of acti-
vation energy in the range of temperature of interest [28].
Table 3 summarizes the results of an internal diffusion test:
they show that regardless of the sample used, the activation
energy does not depend on calcination temperatures. The
values found are around 14–16 kcal/mol, close to those re-
ported for CO oxidation under similar conditions [29,30].
This rules out the possibility that measurements of speciﬁc
rate values were inﬂuenced by internal porosity of our sam-
ples.
The presence of impurities in samples calcined at low
temperature is another matter that deserves further investi-
gation. Because of the preparation method used in our study,

periment conducted by heating under air fresh samples from 473 to 1273 K

weight, left axis).
the presence of residual carbonates and nitrates is a pos-
sibility in samples calcined at low temperature (especially
carbonates in sample CA). Fig. 6 shows a TG analysis of
the three ceria samples conducted under air, which indicates
a signiﬁcant weight loss for the CA sample between 500
and 850 K, corresponding to the decomposition of surface
carbonates and minor desorption features for CB and CC
samples. For calcination temperatures of 900–1100 K, in the
region where CO oxidation activity is strongly enhanced, no
signiﬁcant weight loss is detected, thus ruling out a possi-
ble role of desorption of surface impurities in the increase
of activity observed on samples calcined at high temper-
atures. In a plot of the ﬁrst derivative of the weight loss
signal, several contributions are indicated at low tempera-
tures, with a maximum for CA and CB samples at ca. 760 K,
and a broad shoulder above this temperature. This is likely
to be associated with elimination of bulk ceria carbonates
that need relatively high calcination temperatures [3]. Des-
orption of carbonates, especially for CA samples, does not
seem to inﬂuence the speciﬁc rate of CO oxidation, as in-
ferred from the fact that no relevant changes in activity are
observed in CA samples calcined in the range of 470–800 K
(the samples have higher surface area), where most of the
surface carbonate decomposition takes place. However, one
thing that can explain the difference in activity of CA(473–
873) and CB/CC samples is the possibility that desorption
of carbonates indirectly affects the activity by blocking the
development of {100} faces. This hypothesis, suggested by
a referee, can be supported by the fact that activity in the
CA sample sharply increased after desorption of carbonates
at high temperatures (most likely bulk carbonates) but is not
affected during desoprtion of carbonates at lower tempera-
tures.
Stoichiometry of ceria particles should also be taken into
account to properly address the issue of speciﬁc activity in

CO oxidation. We have found that in the CA sample, the lat-
tice parameters of smaller ceria particles (CA473–CA773)
agree with the presence of some Ce3+ in the lattice. It is
known that nanoparticles of ceria can strongly deviate from
stoichiometry because of the presence of Ce3+ [14,31,32],
and it is also reported that in nanocrystalline ceria powder
the thermodynamics and kinetics of reduction may strongly
vary from what is generally observed in bulk ceria [33]. The
presence of Ce3+ and associated surface vacancies would
lower the number of active sites for CO reaction, thus de-
creasing speciﬁc activity calculated on a square-meter basis.
The amount of Ce3+ found in our samples, keeping also in
mind that more surface Ce3+ could have escaped XRD de-
tection, is localized on samples with a small crystal size and
showing almost constant activity. No changes in stoichiom-
etry are observed in any samples where changes of activity
were detected. In any case, for the majority of samples, the
atmosphere of reaction should guarantee the presence of sto-
ichiometric ceria at the reaction temperature.
Having excluded several major possible explanations of
the increase in the CO oxidation rate against calcination tem-
perature, we might now rationalize this behavior in terms
of (i) preferential formation of more reactive {100} planes
after calcination of crystalline ceria powders in the range
of temperature between 573 and 1073 K and (ii) particu-
larly favorable energetics expected for CO oxidation over
these reactive surfaces. The favorable formation of {100}-
type surfaces upon treatment at high temperature under O2-
containing atmospheres has already been reported for ori-
ented CeO2 ﬁlms [27]. In the case of polycrystalline ceria,
some conﬂicting observations were found in the literature: it
is known that CeO2 particles preferentially expose the {111}
planes, which is the one of lowest energy [1]. In agreement
with this, HRTEM studies of CeO2 reveal that high-surface-
area samples show grains oriented to expose predominantly
{111} planes. This preferential exposure was reported to be-
come dramatically apparent after mild oxidation at 773 K
compared with fresh samples [34], thus excluding in this
study {100} faceting. Conversely, Lunberg et al. [10] re-
ported that from calcination temperatures of 773 to 973 K,
{100} facets were clearly present, and their formation was
attributed to calcination, since at T < 773 K no {100} facets
were observed. In this work, an increase in {100} facets is
progressively observed after calcination of polycrystalline
ceria at T > 773 K. Therefore, it might be concluded that,
excluding a transition region around 773 K, temperatures
higher than 773 K favor the exposure of more reactive
planes. To address the second point raised above, we sug-
gest that improved activity of CeO2 after calcination is due
to the greater capacity of CeO2 {100}-type surfaces com-
pared with {111} to help CO oxidation by supplying oxy-
gen and changing valence. A similar mechanism of action
was described earlier with Pt(111) on ordered (111) CeO2
ﬁlm [35] and on CuO supported on CeO2(100) surfaces [27].
In these cases CO oxidation beneﬁts from the presence of
the redox of ceria, which is facilitated when more reactive
planes are exposed. In addition, although speciﬁcally sup-
ported for {110} and not for {100} surfaces, a stronger inter-
action of CO with this surface might lead to easier formation
of carbonate-like adsorbates, which is a key step in carbon
monoxide oxidation over ceria particles.
In summary, evidence is presented that highlights the role
of reactive surfaces in CO oxidation over different samples
of polycrystalline ceria powders prepared by conventional
methods. These samples, in a fresh state, expose preferen-
tially the more stable {111}-type surfaces, and after ther-
mal treatment more reactive surfaces become visible, at the
expense of a drop in surface area. Therefore, observations
recently reported for 1D ceria samples obtained by more so-
phisticated techniques have been extended to conventionally
prepared polycrystalline ceria samples with catalytic data
recorded under conditions that were determined to be free
from mass transport limitations. The possibility of expos-
ing more reactive surfaces by nonconventional techniques,
thus preserving high surface area, would therefore represent
a key and challenging step in the design of ceria-based cata-
lysts with enhanced redox properties.
