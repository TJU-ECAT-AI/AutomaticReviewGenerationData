Redox processes 
occurring on ceria and R h  
on ceria catalyst have been monitored by X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
(XAS) at the Ce LIII 
edge using a fast collection mode of the data. From changes in the Ce LIII 
shape, a 
quantitative evaluation of the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) content has been monitored within an error estimated to 5%. 
This kinetic study is both confirmed and extended to N20 
chemisorption and thermogravimetric measurements. 
The influence of the ceria surface area and the effect of rhodium are investigated in detail. The redox processes 
are simulated by alternate exposure to H2 and dry air at atmospheric pressure and moderate temperatures 
(573-773 K). Theinitial reductioncontent is dependent on theceria surfacearea, and a kinetic model accounting 
for this behavior is developed. Between 573 and 673 K the reduction starts on the surface through successive 
hydrogen dissociation and anionicvacancy formation, followed by a much slower bulk diffusion step. It is stated 
that the hydrogen dissociation is the limiting step of the surface process on pure ceria. On Rh/CeOz sample 
the surface reduction becomes very fast, due to the faster hydrogen dissociation on metallic rhodium. By 
contrast with reduction, the kinetic behavior for oxidation is very fast on pure ceria, but needs an induction 
time on Rh/CeOz. These deep differences for the redox properties induced both by the high surface area of 
ceria and the presence of a transition metal are related to the behavior of ceria for depollution catalysis. 
I. Introduction 
The use of ceria as a promoter in catalysis for automotive 
pollution control could be partially related to its unique ability 
tostoreor removeoxygen 
in thecourseofthedepollutionprocess.1.2 
Catalysts consist typically of ceria and a transition metal (Pt, Pd, 
or Rh) supportedon 
alumina. The 
reducibility of ceriaisenhanced 
by the presence of a transition metal. This effect is now well 
supported by thermoprogrammed reduction (TPR), X-ray pho- 
toemission (XPS), and X-ray photoabsorption (XAS) 
measurement~.~-5 
This behavior contrasts with the difficulty of 
reducing pure ceria in the conditions 
of depollution (T 
> 
573 K). 
In addition, some difficulties still subsist on ascertaining if the 
substoichiometric 
phases CeO(,,, 
then formed are well or badly 
ordered.6 O

the other hand, data on the kinetic processes of 
reduction and oxidation are rather scarce.'-lo Moreover, the 
samples concerned by these studies were generally calcined at 
high temperatures, so that they exhibited a low surface area. 
However, in a recent publication, an easier reducibility 
for a high 
surface area sample was reported, an effect which emphasizes 
the role played by the surface 
in the reduction 
process.7 To monitor 
the change of the cerium oxidation state during a fast reduction 
process, X-ray absorption on 
the Ce LIII 
edge was recorded in the 
fast acquisition 
mode.11 In that way, it is a complementary probe 
to XPS, which gives mainly information on 
the surface,4*5J2-14

vides information on the structural modifications related to the 
change of the oxidation state.l5 The aim o
f
 
this paper is then to 
gain further insight into the kinetics of the reduction 
and oxidation 
processes on the time scale of a few seconds. We focused in a 
first approach on the H
z
 
reduction and air reoxidation as probes 
of the reductive and oxidative behavior, respectively. 
The samples we studied include pure ceria, of low and high 
surface areas, and ceria as support of a transition metal (Rh) 
catalyst. 
The layout of the paper is as follows. After the introduction 
(part I), the experimental basis of the study (part 11) is described. 
In part I11 the assignation of the Ce LIII 
absorption edge features 
is briefly discussed. Then a method for a quantitative shape 
analysis 
of the Ce LIII 
edge is derived, 
which allows the extraction 
of the Ce(III)/Ce(IV) content. Kinetic results on both the 
reduction and the oxidation processes obtained within a time 
scale of about 1000 s are then displayed (part IV). Thermo- 
gravimetric analysis 
(TGA) and N20 chemisorption experiments 
complement these results. They are included for two reasons. 
This is first another way to check the validity of the quantitative 
interpretation extracted from XAS. Secondly, the X-ray beam 
provided by Synchrotron 
Radiation can be used only for reasonable 
time-consuming 
experiments, 
and there was a need to extend our 
set of data to a longer time scale (1-30 h), particularly for slow 
kinetics. The result is that a kinetic model can then more reliably 
be proposed in the Appendix and checked. The effects of both 
the ceria surface area and the occurrence of a transition metal 
on 
the reduction-reoxidation behavior are finally discussed in 
the framework of this heterogeneous 
kinetic model (part V). The 
main conclusions are recalled in part VI.

673 and 1123 K, respectively). The surface areas determined by 
BET were 125 and 8 m2/g, respectively. The CeOz 
purity was 
99.5%, with La203 as the main impurity (0.3%). Sample AI 
presented a high proportion of microporous area.16 Sample A3 
was provided by Johnson-Matthey (minimum purity 99.99%). 
Rh/Ce02 
(1.45%) was obtained by dry 
impregnation 
of sample 
A1 with the appropriate content of RhC13 solution. The catalyst 
was then dried overnight at 393 K, calcined 1 h in dry air at 673 
K, and finally sieved at 20 pm. The samples were stored in a 
desiccator before any further use. 
HRTEM examination of the catalyst reduced at 673 K 
indicated that the rhodium particles have a mean size of 2-3 
nm.17 
(2) TGA. Thermogravimetric experiments under a reductive 
atmosphere 
were carried 
out in a Setaram microbalance connected 
to a high-vacuum device. A sampleof ca. 70 mg was first calcined 
1 h at 673 K under dry air, cooled down, and evacuated (down 
to 10" Torr) at 
room temperature. The sample 
was then exposed 
to a hydrogen flow (1 
50 mL/min at atmospheric pressure) and 
isothermally reduced by steps 
of 50 K, from 298 K to theultimate 
reduction temperature. Hydrogen was preliminarily purified 
through a palladium membrane. We consider that equilibrium 
was reached when the weight variation per hour was lower than 
0.1% of the overall weight change. Typically, more than 20 h of 
isothermal exposure to hydrogen were required at low tempera- 
tures to fulfill this condition. 
(3) XAS. Ce LIII 
edge absorption experiments were recorded 
on the EXAFS I11 station 
of the 
DCI 
storage 
ring (LURE, 
Orsay). 
Two parallel Si(3 
11) crystals were used as monochromator. One 
of them was tilted so that most of the harmonics were rejected. 
The X-rays beam slits were adjusted to a final resolution of 
about 3 eV at the cerium Ce(OH)3 or Ce(N03)3 edge. Two 
Keithley proportional chambers filled with an appropriate gas 
under static pressure measured the incident (ZO) 
and the 
transmitted (I) 
beams. X-ray energies were calibrated to the 
copper edge at 8991.1 eV. The single Ce LIII 
absorption edge 
peaked then at 5725 f 
1 eV. The data acquisition used the fast 
acquisition setup, which was previously described." 
In our 
conditions, data were collected in an energy range of 100 eV 
around the Ce LII, 
edge in 12 
s with a good signal to noise ratio. 
Samples were preliminarily sieved to 10 
pm and ultrasonically 
dispersed in an ethanol solution. Some drops were withdrawn 
from this dispersion and slowly spread on a graphite 
Papyex sheet. 
After evaporation of the solvent, a second graphite sheet was 
pressed on it, forming the reaction cell. The 
cell was then mounted 
in a stainless steel block provided with gas circulation (30 mL/ 
min) and temperature control. Graphite sheets were pressed so 
that the controlled pressure drop between the gas inlet and outlet 
of the cell never exceeded 5% of the atmospheric pressure. We 
checked that under these conditions no preferential pathways 
existed for the gas circulation 
throughout the 
samplein the 
course 
of the kinetic experiments. Other aspects of this cell were 
described in more detail in the literature.I8 The amount of solid 
dispersion was adjusted so as to obtain a penetration depth by 
the X-rays of around 10-20 pm, corresponding to the optimum 
absorption log(Z/Zo) = 1.5-2.5, using the absorption coefficients 
given by the MacMaster tables.19 Under theseconditions we can 
estimate that the X-ray beam crossed about five to ten layers of 
ceria particles. As the absorption edge step for a single layer is 
less than 0.1, negligible distortion occurred in the absorption 
edge due to a leakage effecte20

Prior to the kinetics experiments, the samples were calcined 
1 h in situ under dry air. After the sample reached the required 
working temperature, gas composition was changed by rapidly 
switching the gas inlet. The beginning of the kinetics ( t  
= 
0) was 
arbitrarily referenced to the first detection of a shape 
modification 
of the Ce LIII 
edge (Figure 4). Dry air and HZ 
(purity 99.995%) 
from L'Air Liquide wereused without further purification. Unless 
otherwise stated, the gas flows were 30 and 15 mL/min for Hz 
and air, respectively.

Pulses of NzO 
in helium were injected, and the outgoing gas

both of the following conditions were fulfilled: (i) the N2 peak 
disappeared and (ii) the NzO peak was saturated. The total 
volume V N ~ O  
required for the complete reoxidation of ceria was 
then given by formula 1: 
where VB 
is the volume of the gas loop, A, and Ai are the surface 
areas of the N2O peak at the saturation and the injection i, 
respectively. We checked that the N20 consumption was equal 
to the NZ 
evolution within 5%.

 Ce(II1) and Ce(1V) Oxidation States Deduced from the 
XAS Analysis of the LIII 
Edge 
(1) Ce L11l Edge. In order to obtain quantitative information 
from the analysis of the Ce LIII edge, we must first recall 
experimental and theoretical assignments of the LIII 
cerium 
absorption edge given in the literature. 
The Ce LIII 
absorption edge of a pure Ce(1V) compound such 
as CeOz exhibits three distinct lines, denoted A, B2, and C, 
respectively (Figure l), 
in good agreement with previous reported 
spectra of Ce0z.22 
With enough resolution, a structure BI 
appears 
clearly as 
a shoulder 
of the most intense Bz structure. These lines 
were not only observed on other Ce(1V) compounds such as Ce- 
(so4)223 
or CeF424 
but also on other rare earth oxides with the 
fluorite structure (PrOz, TbOz),25 
although their intensities and 
relative energy positions were slightly modified according to the 
nature of the material. Their occurrence was related to the 
symmetry of the local environment around the absorbant cation 
Ce(1V). Kotani et a1.26 were the 
first to point out a charge 
transfer 
from vdence 0 
2p states to Ce 
4f localized states of the rare earth 
in the final state. This charge transfer was responsible for the 
multiple contributions observed in the Ce L ~ I I  
edge, as for the Ce 
3d core level photoemission features.27 Inverse photoemission 
investigationsz8 and valence band calculationsz9 
supported the 
conclusion that this charge transfer was rendered possibly by the 
strong f character of some valence band 0 2p states. This 
assumption could then reconcile the XAS and XPS 
spectroscopic 
investigations with the macroscopic properties of CeOz, which is 
well-known to be an insulator and a diamagnetic phase. This 
also means that 
the 
Ce-0 bond has a partially covalent character.30 
Whereas most authors agreed to assign the wide line C to the 
Ce [2p54P5d*,I] 0 
2p6 final state configuration (possibly with 
someweakcontributionoftheCe 
[2p54P5d*,l] 0 
2p4finalstateZ7), 
some controversy still persists when assigning the B1 and B2 lines.

assigned these lines to a strong mixture 
of Ce [2p54f15ds,1] 0 
2p5 and Ce [2ps4fr5d*,l] 0 2p4 states, 
respectively. The additional introduction of a coulombic repulsion 
term between the f and d electrons in the final state contributes 
however to a sharp decrease, if not a disappearance of the Ce

impurities is highly improbable. Dexpert et al.25 introduced 
localized (BI) and delocalized (B2) 4f final states, in relation to 
the reported nature of the valence band. Finally, the very weak 
feature A can be attributed (i) to transitions toward Ce 6s states 
allowed by the dipole selection rule or (ii) to the presence of 
impurities (hydroxyl groups, etc.). This very weak contribution 
will be neglected in the following. 
By comparison, the shape of the Ce(II1) absorption state is 
quite 
simple, 
as 
only one 
single line noted Bo in Figure 1 
is observed. 
This white line was assigned to the Ce [2p54f15d*,*] 
0 
2p6 final 
state, the 
4f states being strongly localized well behind the valence 
states in the Ce(II1) ground configuration. This single line was 
observed whatever the nature of the Ce(II1) compound: Ce- 
(OH)3,22b Ce(N03)3,23 
or CeF3.24 We determined an energy 
difference of 1.85 eV between this line and the Bl line of CeO2 
(Table 2), both by recording the two reference compounds CeO2 
and Ce(OH)3 successively and from the best fit agreement 
obtained on a partially reduced ceria (Figure 2). The Bo line 
pointed at a lower energy than any other features of the CeO2 
edge. 
In conclusion, the Ce L I I ~  
absorption edge provides well- 
characteristic fingerprints of the Ce(1V) and Ce(II1) oxidation 
states, respectively. The Ce(1V) oxidation state yields the 
characteristic 
lines A (neglected), BI and BZ 
(hardly separated), 
and C, whereas the Ce(II1) oxidation state yields the single line 
Bo hardly separated from the B1 and Bz features. Thus, only a 
line-shape analysis 
could provide the 
relative contribution 
of each 
oxidation state in a mixed situation. 
(2) Quantitative Analysis. The fitting procedure used a 
computer program slightly modified by comparison with the fits 
reported in ref 7 
(Figure 3). The background was first removed 
and the 
spectra were normalized to 
the absorption of the 
continuum 
states. This was 
achieved by reference to the inflexion points of

by a convolution of the following contributions (Figure 3 and

line shape with a 
(2) The experimental resolution was adjusted by a Gaussian 
line shape with a G width of 3 eV. 
(3) Thedensityofunoccupied Sdstateswasfitted byaparabolic 
function with a Wwidth reported in Table 2. This contribution 
to the broadening of the peak was fixed to 3 eV, except for the 
high-energy contribution where the width was much larger 
(around 9 eV). 
These different contributions were then convoluted and added 
to the transitions toward the continuum states simulated by a 
step function convoluted with the experimental and core hole 
lifetime broadenings. 
The thresholds of the step functions were taken at the Bo and 
B1 energies with intensities proportional to the Ce(II1) and the 
Ce(1V) absorption intensities, respectively. 
Experimental spectra were fitted by a Simplex method, in which 
only the intensity of each line and the broadening W 
of the line 
C were allowed to vary. For a given sample, the relative binding 
energies were kept constant. A small energy shift was however 
observed between samples A and B. A similar behavior was 
reported on 
CeOZ-TiOz mixed oxides.32 This small energy shift 
can be attributed to a crystal field effect in the fluorite structure. 
In addition, the difference spectrum between the experimental 
and calculated spectra is also reported in Figure 2b. It 
was checked 
that the error was randomly distributed on the overall energy 
range of the fit. The energy domain where the calculation is

As reported by XPS,33 the reduction of ceria in the presence 
of rhodium occurred even at 
room temperature. We 
thus reported 
the weight loss between 302 and 402 K that we assigned both to 
rhodium oxide and ceria reduction.34 We noted that the slope 
of -AM/M above 402 K is lower than on 
pure ceria, with a sharp 
decrease above 743 K. Nevertheless, the weight difference at 
843 
K between the 
two samples (0.54%) cannot be fully accounted 
for by the reduction of rhodium according to eq I11 (1.13%). As 
the rhodium is fully reduced and the equilibrium IV is displaced 
toward hydrogen desorption at 
high temperatures, this difference 
meant that the ceria is less reduced in the presence of rhodium.

A1 in Figure 4. Qualitatively, the 
reduction process resulted in an increase in the 
contribution 
noted 
Bo and in a decrease of the other contributions. This is clearly 
apparent 
in the 
inset of Figure4 
when superposing the 
normalized 
initial (t = 0) and the reduced (t = 1500 s) spectra. The time 
scale was referenced to the 
moment when line-shapemodifications 
began to occur. In Figure 6 (insets) the kinetics of reduction 
content, determined by the curve-fitting procedure and eqs 2 and 
3, are plotted for Ce02 
A1 and A2 and Rh/CeOz at 
673,753, 
and 
673 
K, respectively. The 
temperature domain investigated ranged 
between 573 and 773 K. 
Large modifications of the Ce Llll edge line shape initially 
occurred on 
pure ceria sample 
Al. The 
process then slowed down,

but variations of the LIII 
edge line shape were still detectable, 
even after a long time of hydrogen exposure. 
Above 673 K for sample AI, we always observed some 
discontinuity during the reduction process (not shown). After a 
sharp initial increase of the Bo intensity (about 1 min), 
discontinuous behavior was observed. Moreover, the mean degree 
of reduction a(t) defined by eq 3 generally decreased. For 
example, the Ce(II1) content after 25 min of reduction was 20, 
16, and 8% at 673, 723, and 753 K, respectively. As we will 
discuss later, this effect can be attributed to pore filling, which 
occurs in addition to some chemical reduction. BET measure- 
ments performed on 
the same sample A1 clearly indicated that 
the surface area sharply decreased under hydrogen above 673 
K.16 The surface was not stabilized above 673 K. This physical 
process competing with the reduction process precluded us from 
further studying the reduction above 673 K. However, assuming 
that this pore filling was in fact a direct consequence of the 
reduction process, its initial rate was negligible. Thus, the 
experimental rate constant of the initial reduction ko represented 
the rate constant of the virgin sample. ko values were extracted 
from the initial slope of the curve % Ce(II1) = f i t )  (Figure 6). 
The report of ko in an Arrhenius plot (Figure 7) within the 
temperature range 573-773 K led to an activation energy of 67 
f 
12 kJ/mol. 
The low surface area sample A2 exhibited a much weaker 
reduction (around 4%), which occurred at temperatures highly 
than 753 K only (Figure 6B). Sample A3, which is of a different 
origin, behaved quite similarly to sample Al. 
Finally, we performed repeated isothermal cycles of reduction- 
reoxidation, and we obtained quite reproducible degrees of 
reduction, provided the reduction temperature did not exceed 
673 K. In separate experiments, N2 was admitted for 0.5 h 
between air and H2. No detectable change was observed due to 
thisadditional 
treatment, within thelimitsof theanalysis 
accuracy. 
The Rh/CeOz sample behavior was quite different from that 
of ceria samples for thereduction process (Figure 
6C). Reduction 
was achieved within the collection time of one spectrum (12 s), 
whatever the temperature, in the range 573-773 K. We failed 
to detect an intermediate behavior by decreasing the recording 
time to 4 s. This means that the initial reduction rate was much 
faster than the recording time of the spectrum, Le. 4 s. The 
extent of reduction was 23% f 
2%, whatever the reduction 
temperature. This value remained unchanged even after 3 h 
under hydrogen flow. We noted also that we could not fit the 
initial XAS spectrum, before introducing the hydrogen, with the 
three lines characteristic of the Ce(1V) state only. We had to 
introduce a small but definite contribution Bo, characteristic of 
the Ce(II1) line, which represented about 3-5% of the total area 
of the edge. 
In order to fit these data, we have developed a kinetic model 
for ceria reduction. This model is depicted in Scheme 1 and

detailed in the 
Appendix. In 
this classical modelof heterogeneous 
gas-solid reduction,35 
we explicitly took into account both surface 
and 
bulksteps. Surface steps 
include 
successively (1) 
dissociative 
chemisorption of hydrogen onto the surface to form hydroxyl 
groups (step l), (2) anionic vacancy formation with reduction of 
the neighboring cations (step 2), and (3) water desorption (step 
3). 
Following these steps, diffusion of the 
surface anionic vacancies 
into the bulk occurs (step 4). 
With pure ceria, the results strongly suggested that one of the 
surface steps was rate limiting. We linked then the reduction of 
a surface layer to the surface area of the sample. We showed 
that the reduction conversion a(t) can be expressed by the 
following differential equation: 
dcY/(a - 
K )  = -k 
dt 
(4) 
where k is the rate constant of the process and K a constant 
depending both on 
the 
thermodynamic equilibrium of the surface 
steps and on 
a partition function between surface and bulk sites. 
The expressions of the constants k and K depend on 
the rate- 
determining step. The K expression is reported in the Appendix 
(eq 16). The k expressions depend on the rate-limiting step. 
They are displayed in Table 3. 
Whatever the rate-limiting step, we obtained by integrating eq 
4 a straight line in the proper ln(K/K-42)) =At) 
representation.

are reported in Table 4. The k 
values were deduced from these 
fits. They were in good agreement with those determined by the 
slopeof the initial reduction versus time (Figure 6). The 
Kvalues 
were adjustable 
thermodynamic 
parameters which were estimated 
from the degree of reduction at the end of the surface process. 
In contrast, the large initial reduction rate observed on the 
Rh/CeO2 sample precluded the determination of any kinetic 
parameter. According to the model however, the occurrence of 
an initial reduction strongly suggested that either step 3 (water 
desorption) or step 4 (bulk diffusion) was rate limiting. 
(b) Reoxidation. The kinetics of reoxidation are plotted in 
Figure 9. Ce02 
and Rh/CeO2 samples exhibited quite different 
behavior. On Ce02 sample AI, the reoxidation occurred at so 
high a rate that the process was completely achieved within the 
time acquisition of one spectrum. Attempts to detect an 
intermediate state of CeOz, by decreasing the recording time 
down 
to 2 s but at the expense of the signal to noise ratio, were 
unsuccessful. 
On Rh/CeO2 however, the process was fast but needs some 
induction time. We checked that this induction time was 
dependent on 
air flow, an effect that did not exist at all on 
pure 
ceria. Moreover, as noted for the reduction process, the 
reoxidation process was not complete. About 34% 
of the cerium 
remained at the I11 state even after a long reoxidation time. 
Let us conclude finally on 
a general remark: the CeOl and 
Rh/CeO2 samples 
behaved inversely. The 
reduction kinetics was 
quite fast on 
Rh/Ce02 and slower on 
CeOz. The inverse was 
observed in the reoxidation process. 
(3) N20 Reactivity. N2O adsorption measurements were 
performed on the CeO2 sample 
A1 in the temperature range 573- 
673 K. The aim was then to monitor the reduction kinetics on 
a larger time scale than that of the XAS experiment (up to 1500 
min compared to 120 
min). The results concerning the evolution 
at 673 K are presented in Figure 6A. The agreement between 
the two measurements is satisfactory. A similar behavior was 
observed in the range 573-673 K. The difference between the

two sets of data at a given reduction time never exceeds 376, the 
N20 
chemisorption value being generally slightly lower than that 
extracted from the Ce LIII 
edge analysis. 
A reduction process monitored over a large time scale pointed 
out that the ceria sample AI 
did not reach an equilibrium, even 
after more than 1000 min of H2 exposure. Attempts to fit the 
set of both XAS and NzO adsorption data within a first-order 
ln(K/(K-cy(?))) =At) 
kinetic representation, as 
in Figure 8, 
were 
unsuccessful. Moreover, we detected an inflexion point whose 
value was increasing with the reduction temperature. At 673 K, 
this inflexion point reached about 20%. According to the model 
developed in the Appendix, we believed that this inflexion 
corresponded to a transition from a surface process to a bulk 
process. We 
assumed then that the overall kinetic process involved 
two successive processes, with highly different reaction rates. 
The fast first step was a surface reaction (step 1 or 2), followed 
by slow diffusion into the 
bulk (step4). The 
proper representation 
was then ln((K-A,( T))/(K-a(t))) 
=At), 
where 
A,( 7
'
)
 is 
thesurface 
reduction at the beginning of the bulk diffusion. For example, 
we quoted A,(T) = 0.2, by extrapolating to zero time the bulk 
diffusion part of the curve. For sample A1 at 673 K, this value 
of A,( T )  
agrees well with the calculated value A,"of the complete 
reduction of a surface monolayer.36 A," is calculated according 
to eq 21 in the Appendix. As shown in Figure 10, experimental 
data nicely fitted this representation. We considered therefore 
that this model can be an acceptable description of the kinetic 
process of reduction. Useful information can then be extracted 
from the parameters k, K, and A,(T) deduced from these fits. 
They are reported in Table 4. 
(1) The surface reduction at the end of the surface process 
As(T) 
widely increased in the temperature range 573-673 K. 
The surface reduction at 673 K corresponded to the upper limit 
of Asm, 
where the whole ceria surface was reduced. 
(2) Comparing the 
slopes of the bulk and the 
surface 
processes, 
we concluded that the rate constant was about 2 orders of 
magnitude lower in the bulk process. 
(3) We determined an activation energy of about 21 kJ/mol 
for the diffusion step 4 in the temperature range 573-673 K. 
V. Discussion 
Before discussing the kinetic results concerning ceria, let us 
first consider the usefulness of X-ray absorption experiments 
compared to other probes. The goal of this paper was to extract 
the reduction content of ceria after a short reduction time from 
shape modifications of the Ce LIII 
edge. Below 673 K the ceria 
surface is stable under hydrogen, and a comparison with TGA, 
N20 
adsorption, and magnetic susceptibility 
measurements 
results 
can proceed on 
the same sample, Al, and with a comparable 
reduction time. At 673 K the degree of reduction after 2 h of 
reduction are quoted as 24% (XAS) and 26% (N2O adsorption), 
which compares favorably with the value of 22% reported by 
magnetic measurements.I2 After 20 h of reduction, the degree 
of reduction is respectively 32% (TGA), 36% (N20 
adsorption), 
and 32% (magnetic susceptibility12), 
respectively. We note that 
after only 20 min of reduction, the reduction reported by XAS 
was already 20%. Fast surface reduction is also pointed out by 
XPS 
modificationsof the Ce 
3d core 
level.17J3 These 
comparisons 
point out (1) the good agreement between the determination of 
the reduction conversion by different probes and (2) the clear 
Occurrence of a slow reduction that follows the fast reduction 
process achieved in about 20 min. 
This agreement is achieved in spite of the complexity of the 
Ce LIII 
edge when the Ce(1V) oxidation state is involved. This 
reliability allows us to specify safely the relative energy position 
of the many Ce(1V) features (B1, Bz, and C) between them and 
relative to the Ce(II1) feature BO 
(Table 2). For example, we 
report an energy separation of 1.85 eV between the BO 
and B1 
contributions and 3.8 eV between the BI and B2 contributions. 
Up to now, the relative energy positions of the Ce(1V) features 
were only partially reported.2ss27 Let us recall however that the 
energy position of these contributions can slightly shift when the 
anion environment around cerium cations or the nature of the 
rare earth cation changes. Energy shifts are reported on 
chemically mixed CeOz-Ti02 oxides32 
and on 
rare earth oxides 
of the similar fluorite structure (Pro,, Tb0z).2s 
Let us now consider the change in cerium oxidation state 
induced by reduction and oxidation processes, respectively.

(I) 
Influence o
f
 the Specific Surface Area. The effect of the 
surface area is clearly pointed out by the different reduction 
behavior of samples A1 and A2 (or A3). These samples differ 
only by their surface 
area, high and 
low 
for AI 
and 
At, 
respectively. 
More precisely, the model that we developed in the Appendix 
points out that on 
pure ceria (i) the first step of the process is a 
surface step and (ii) a correlation can be found between the 
optimum extent of reduction of this first step and the amount of 
anionic surface sites. 
As a consequence of these two points, the reduction extent in 
a short time range is highly sensitive to the surface area. It is 
only when much of the surface 
sites are 
reduced that 
bulk reduction 
begins to occur, in the temperature domain considered here. 
The first point (i) is ascertained by an initial reduction of ceria 
from 0 to around 20%. At this value, a break in the kinetics 
occurs and further reduction is much more slower. The first part 
of the kinetics agrees well with a model where a surface step is 
ratelimiting (see 
Appendix). These 
surface steps 
involve 
hydrogen 
dissociation (step 1) and anion vacancies formation with cation 
reduction (step 2), respectively (Scheme 1). 
An alternative pathway to a surface reaction is invoked by 
Fierro et al.'Oand Cunningham et al.34 They invoke the 
formation 
of a bronze CeOZH, followed by a bulk reduction, according to 
reactions V and VI: 
(V) 
CeO, + (x/2)H2 - 
CeO,H, 
CeO,H, - 
(x/2)H,O + CeO,,,, 
We failed to observe the TGA any weight gain above 393 K. 
We believe this observation does not mean that any bronze 
formation did not take place, but the high surface area of sample 
A1 enhances 
the 
surface process to thedetriment of a bulk process. 
Anyway, a reduction process according to a bronze formation 
can be ruled out for the following reasons: 
(1) This bronze is reported to be unstable at temperatures 
higher than 573 K. 
Redox Processes on 
Pure Ceria and on 
Rh/CeO2 Catalyst 
The Journal o
f
 Physical Chemistry, Vol. 98, No. 21, 1994 5529 
(2) A bronze formation and a bulk reduction, according to eqs 
V and VI, cannot explain the break in the reduction kinetics at 
about 20-23% of sample AI at 673 K. 
(3) Such a process supposes a high rate of bulk water diffusion 
through preferential pathways like grain boundaries diffusion. 
This seems unlikely. 
As far as the second point (ii) is concerned, we can roughly 
evaluate the proportion of surface anionic sites in the function 
of the surface area. This evaluation had been developed by 
Johnson and Mooi.36 The expressions are reported in the 
Appendix. The proportion of surface anionic sites NsA 
is then 
given by eq 19. The complete reduction of a surface monolayer 
A," is given by eq 21, assuming that the creation of a surface 
oxygen vacancy results in the reduction of two adjacent Ce(1V) 
ions into Ce(II1) ions. We calculate then a reduction content of 
3 and 22% 
for surface areas of 8 and 120 m2/g corresponding to 
the samples AI and A2, respectively. These results compare 
favorably with the experimental values of 4 and 23% 
obtained 
after 20 min of reduction at 673 K for samples A1 and A2, 
respectively. This is just before the break of the slope in the 
ln((K-A,( T))/(K-a(t))) 
= 
f(t) representation. We believe an 
even more accurate determination of the surface reduction is 
provided by considering the break in the kinetic behavior of ceria 
reduction (Figure 10). We assign this change of slope to the slow 
bulk diffusion of anion vacancies that follows the fast surface 
reduction. An extrapolation to zero time gives then a value of 
20% 
for sample AI. 
The 
occurrence of reduction for ceria must be discussed however 
from a thermodynamic point of view. Ceria is well-known to be 
difficult to reduce, especially in the temperature range 573-773 
K. Then at given temperature and partial pressure ratio PH2/ 
PH20, to what extent is ceria reduction afforded? We 
can estimate 
it by determining the equilibrium constant Kp of the overall 
equilibrium VII: 
2Ce0, + H, - 
Ce203 
+ H20 
The free enthalpies of Ce2O3 and CeO2 formation are given 
respectively by eqs 5 and 6:37 
AG?(Ce203) = -424100 + 
65.8T 
(cal/mol) 
(5) 
AG?(CeO,) = -259650 + 50.7T 
(cal/mol) 
(6) 
whereas the oxygen partial pressure is determined from equi- 
librium VIW8 
(VIII) 
Unfortunately, the real partial pressure ratio PH~/PH~o 
above 
the surface is unknown. We 
only know the initial partial pressure 
ratio, which is lower than l e 5 .  Using the data of eqs 5 and 6, 
we can estimate that reduction readily occurs only if the water 
pressure above the surface does not exceed about 1W atm. We 
must recall however that these simple considerations neglect 
possible thermodynamic stabilization in one of the numerous 
substoichiometric oxides.3942 We can nevertheless state that 
reduction is thermodynamically possible, provided that the 
water 
partial pressure above the surface of the sample does not exceed 
too far the residual water pressure in the gas phase. 
Reduction of ceria has been already studied in the literature, 
but comparison with other kinetic data is rather limited as the 
partial pressure ratio PHZ/PH20 and the contact time are widely 
changed and often not accurately controlled, according to the 
used probe and experimental conditions. Yao et al.3 reported by 
thermoprogrammed reduction a negligible reduction at 673 K, 
but on 
ceria samples of very low surface area. Otsuka et ale9 
reported cycles of reduction-reoxidation at temperatures above 
873 K. They noted a decrease of the surface area during the 
cycle. This means that the surface of these samples was probably 
not stabilized. Fierro et a1.I0 noted a reduction of about 0.1 
1 at 
653 K for a ceria of surface area 58.7 m2/g, a value in good 
agreement with a fully reduced surface, if we consider the 
relationship of Johnson and M o o P  
(eqs 20 and 21). Laachir et 
a1.I2 
monitored the reduction of the same samples, AI 
and A2, by 
magnetic susceptibility measurements, TPR, XPS, FTIR, and 
UV-visible reflectance spectroscopy. They reported a reduction 
content of 21% 
after 120 min on sample AI and a negligible 
reduction content on sample A2 at 673 K, in excellent agreement 
with our data. They also point out that the reduction is still 
occurring up to 20 h. They then obtained a reduction of 32%. 
This comparison with literature thus strongly suggests that ceria 
reduction at moderate temperature is initially governed by a 
surface reduction process. 
We observe however that the reduction extent on 
sample A, 
sharply decreases above 673 K. Moreover, the kinetic curves are 
then rather disturbed. We believe this can be correlated with the 
sharp decrease in the surface area observed on 
this sample under 
hydrogen above 673 K.I6 Assuming that the bulk reduction 
remains negligible, we suggest therefore that two effects are 
then 
competing in opposite senses: (i) a physical process of pore filling 
resulting in a loss of surface site density and (ii) the chemical 
reduction of these surface sites. The apparent decrease of the 
degree of reduction suggests that the pore-filling process is less 
activated. 
In the framework of our model, it is helpful to address the 
question of the rate-determining step among the three surface 
steps. This is possible as, even if bulk reduction is obviously the 
limiting step of the overall process, the surface rate is so low that 
it may be considered independent of the bulk reduction. 
Considering 
the initial rate of reduction, 
we report an apparent 
activation energy of 67 kJ/mol. As we cannot settle which step, 
1, 2, or 3, is the rate-determining step of the surface reaction, a 
comparison 
of the activation energy 
with data from the literature 
can be of useful help. Data 
can be extracted 
for activation energies 
of ceria reduction including H20r CO 
as 
reductive reagent,B-l0,43-46 
oxygen self-diff~sion,~~ 
and ionic c o n d u c t i ~ i t y . ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  
Other data 
concerning praseodymia and terbia of similar structure are also 
available.37 We must here keep in mind two factors when 
comparing our results with these data. First, the activation 
energies depend on 
the oxygen partial pressure,  PO^.^^ As stated 
above, Po2 over the surface is unknown, but an upper limit of 
PH20/PH2 quoted to lo4 atm can be estimated. Second, one 
must take into consideration the high density of surface sites of 
sample A,. Then activation energies can be strongly modified 
through lateral interactions between the surface sites. Despite 
these two limitations, useful information can be extracted from 
the literature. We can thus clearly rule out a phase boundary 
process of reduction as both (i) the kinetic law does not obey such 
a process and (ii) the activation energy is much higher (about 
210 kJ/m01).~~ 
Activation energies of 155 kJ/molg and 138 kJ/ 
moll0 were reported for ceria reduction of low or medium surface 
areas by H2. These authors concluded that hydrogen dissociation 
was the rate-limiting step. Gumin45 and Breysse et al.,8 in an 
accurate 
study 
of ceria reduction by CO, 
determined an activation 
energy of 84 kJ/mol for the formation of an oxygen vacancy. 
This can be compared also with the activation energy of oxygen 
self-diffusion through a vacancy mechanism (100 kJ/m01).~' 
However the oxygen self-diffusion process is reported to vary 
from 100 to 17 kJ/mol in CeO,,,, 
when x increases from 0 to 
0.18.47 Similarly, activation energies of ionic conductivity are 
reported to vary from 105 kJ/mol for x = 0.01 to 71 kJ/mol for 
x = 0.2, respe~tively.~~ 
The lack of information on 
the real P
o
2
 
pressure, the possible occurrence of lateral interactions at high 
surface area, and the wide variation of the activation energy of 
oxygen vacancy formation with the content of oxygen vacancy 
complicate any comparison with literature. However, owing to 
5530 The Journal o
f

El Fallah et al. 
the results obtained with the presence of rhodium that we shall 
discuss later, we believe that step 1 of dissociative hydrogen 
adsorption is limitative of the surface reduction. As a matter of 
fact, the main effect of rhodium is to hugely increase this rate 
of hydrogen dissociation. 
A bulk diffusion process follows the initial surface step. We 
determine an activation energy of 21 kJ/mol for this step. This 
valuecompares favorably with literaturedata 
for a bulk diffusion 
through a vacancy mechanism.50 We must keep in mind however 
that the activation energies for oxygen self-diffusion or ionic 
conductivity are also strongly dependent on the vacancy content 
and the crystallographic 
structure 
of the 
substoichiometric 
oxide.

f
 
the Transition 
Metal. The 
addition of rhodium 
modifies strongly the reduction kinetics. The reduction amounts 
instantaneously to 23-2596, close to the complete surface 
reduction. We estimate then that the initial reduction rate 
constant at 673 K exceeds 0.08 
s-l. According to our model, this 
immediate reduction of part of the ceria implies that the surface 
steps 1 and 2 becomes very fast. Then either step 3 or 4 is rate 
determining. Step 3 involves water desorption from the surface, 
and step 4 is the diffusion of the anionic vacancies into the bulk 
of the solid. Several reasons lead us however to rule out a slow 
water desorption step 3: 
(1) Water evolution on Rh/CeOZ occurs at much lower 
temperatures, as detected by thermoprogrammed desorption.51 
(2) A high water partial pressure above the surface will inhibit 
ceria reduction. 
The high rate of the initial surface reduction can be explained 
by the well-known hydrogen dissociation on 
metallic rhodium, as 
on 
other transition metal such as Pt, Pd, etc. This hydrogen, 
probably in a very reactive form, can then spill over the support 
where it allows the removal of surface oxygen and createa surface 
vacancy. The initial reduction on Rh/CeOZ is ca. 22-24%, a 
value close to the 
value of the fully reduced surface deduced from 
the extrapolation to zero time on a pure ceria sample or to the 
value calculated according to eq 21. This means that the whole 
surface is immediately reduced. This is in good agreement with 
XPS investigations on the same samples.33 Furthermore, as 
discussed later, this reduced surface is not completely removed 
upon further reoxidation. 
After this fast surface reduction step, we fail to detect further 
noticeable reduction. TGA provides additional information on 
this point: the deficit in weight loss between the Rh/Ce02 and 
the 
CeOz samples can 
be explained by a lower extent of the 
overall 
ceria reduction in the presence of rhodium. Assuming a full 
reduction of the metal and the complete surface reduction of 
ceria, this means that the presence of a transition metal inhibits 
the oxygen vacancy diffusion inside the bulk of ceria. This can 
be understood within the model of oxygen vacancy filling by 
transition metal atoms56 that blocks the diffusion. The atomic 
radius of rhodium (0.1 
34 nm) comparesfairly 
well with theoxygen 
ionic radius in ceria (0.1356 nm).37 
We conclude then that, compared to the pure ceria, the 
reduction process in the presence of rhodium is much faster but, 
on a larger time scale, the extent of this reduction is lower. 
B. Reoxidation. By comparison with reduction, the kinetics 
of reoxidation is far simpler on pure ceria. The reoxidation rate 
is much faster than the time scale needed to record the Ce Llrr 
absorption 
edge. We 
can thus estimate it to exceed 0.08 
s-1. This 
is in agreement with the literature data, where anomalously high 
rates of reoxidation were reported, even at room temperature.52 
Furthermore, the reoxidation is complete. 
By contrast, the reoxidation of cerium in Rh/CeOz needs an 
induction time before starting up and is not complete. These two 
points deserve a discussion. 
We note that we still measure an irreversible content of Ce- 
(111) cations with the presence of rhodium under air at 673 K. 
The content of these Ce(II1) cations amounts to 3-5%, which is 
within experimental error. It could be explained by an energy 
shift of the absorption contribution Bo due to the presence of 
rhodium in interaction with ceria. We cannot also exclude the 
possibility of an irreversible and partial reduction of the ceria 
support (surface and/or bulk) by a strong interaction with the 
transition metal. More probably, a chemical effect by formation 
of a cerium chloride 
or oxychloride can be invoked. These 
species 
can easily be obtained by reaction of the 
rhodiumchloride, RhC13, 
precursor with the rare earth oxide. The cerium oxidation state 
in such compounds is 111. Similar species have been identified 
on 
palladium and cerium or other rare earth cataly~ts.~J3 
The 
cerium oxychloride is stable under an air atmosphere up to 723 
K and is decomposed above this tem~erature.~~ 
Assuming the 
quantitative 
formation of the oxychloride, we calculate a Ce(II1) 
content of 6%, on the basis of the remaining chlorine content at 
673 K reported in Table 1. This value is not far from the 
experimental one of 3-5% for the irreversible content of Ce(II1) 
cations. 
Otherwise, the Occurrence of an induction time is supported 
by a recent similar study on a Pt/Rh/CeO~/A1203 
depollution 
catalysts4 
and by thermoprogrammed oxidations which point out 
oxygen consumptions at 
high temperature on Pd/Ce02 
catalysts.55 
Tentative explanations must taken into account the presence of 
the transition metal. Recent EXAFS investigations on a Pt/ 
Rh/Ce/AlzOs catalyst outline the Occupation by metallic atoms 
of oxygen vacancy sites.54 Again, we can invoke the 
Sanchez and 
Gasquez model of oxygen vacancy filling by transition metal 
atoms.56 In the reduced state, metallic atoms are buried into the 
anionic array of the fluorite crystal. We can therefore suppose 
that the gaseous oxygen needs first to expel the rhodium atoms 
from their anionic sites before filling them and then reoxidizing 
the nearest cerium atoms. The first step of the process is then 
believed to be the oxidation of the metallic rhodium buried in the 
ceria anionic 
array, 
a process which is supposed to be much slower 
than the ceria reoxidation itself. We must also note that the 
surface anionic sites NsA 
on 
sample At calculated according to 
eq 19 are in large excess compared to rhodium atoms. 
Alternative 
explanations 
involve a strong 
electronic interaction 
between rhodium and the first surface layers of ceria which 
prevents the fast reoxidation of the support. In a similar way we 
can suppose the formation of a surface phase of rhodium and 
some layers of reduced ceria in a different crystallographic 
rearrangement. Thus, for the very rich phase diagram of ceria 
at temperatures below 707 K, the phase transition of the ordered 
substoichiometric 
phase labeled 6 
to the phase labeled C
Y
 requires 
a crystallographic 
rearrangement, which is an activated process.42 
Whatever the explanation, complementary works require the 
acquisition of structural information of these samples under 
controlled gas conditions. EXAFS experiments, which can be 
carried out in similar conditions, seem to be adapted to answer 
this problem. 
Finally, these results could be related to the properties of ceria 
in the depollution catalysis. Ceria is well-known to be able to 
store oxygen in the course of the depollution process. In spite of 
the widely different temperature range and gas environment 
between our study and the depollution process, the observation 
that in the presence of rhodium the rate of oxidation slows down 
whereas 
the 
rate 
of reduction dramatically 
accelerates can support 
an explanation on the behavior of ceria in depollution catalysis. 
As these two reactions have then comparable rates, ceria can 
store and remove oxygen in the very short time of the depollution 
process, working in non-steady-state conditions. In contrast, pure 
ceria cannot possess the same behavior, as the oxidation rate is 
much faster than the reduction rate. Further works, including 
the proper temperature range and 
gas environment and time scale 
studies, are needed however to check these considerations. 
VI. Conclusions 
The main results of this work are summarized as follows: 
Redox Processes on 
Pure Ceria and on 
Rh/CeO2 Catalyst

(1) XAS measurements recorded in the fast acquisition mode 
prove to be an efficient probe to monitor the change in cerium 
oxidation state within a short kinetic process. 
(2) Combined use of XAS with TGA and N20 adsorption 
allows us to describe the kinetic behavior of ceria or ceria-based 
systems modified by a transition metal on 
a large time scale. The 
XAS probe is however of limited use for very fast processes such 
as those with a first-order rate constant larger than 0.1 s-I. 
(3) The reduction content of pure ceria is highly dependent on 
the surface area. The reduction occurs preliminarily through a 
surface process. 
(4) 
The redox behavior of Rh/CeO2 is quite different from 
that of pure ceria. In the presence of a transition metal, the 
reduction rate is highly increased, whereas the oxidation rate 
needs an induction time before starting. 
(5) A kinetic model of ceria reduction is developed that takes 
into account the two effects of the surface area and the presence 
of a transition metal. Ceria reduction occurs first through a 
surface limitative 
step, probably hydrogen dissociation, followed 
by a much slower bulk diffusion step. The rate of the surface 
step is highly increased on Rh/Ce02 samples through fast 
hydrogen dissociation on 
rhodium.

Appendix 
Modeling of the Reduction Kinetics of Ceria with a Large 
Surface Area. The reduction of ceria can be described according 
to a four-step process displayed in Scheme 1. This is a general 
scheme 
for heterogeneous gas-solid reduction.3s We add further 
relations taking into account the large surface area of the sample 
2. Formation o
f
 Anionic Vacancies with Cation Reduction. 
The 
adsorbed hydrogen contributes to the reduction of the 
cation 
from Ce(1V) to Ce(II1) by formation of an anionic vacancy. The 
rate, V2, of this step can be expressed as follows: 
where CsA represents the surface concentration in anionic 
vacancies. Here the factor 2 takes into account the probability 
of oxygen vacancy formation relative to the dissociation of one 
hydrogen molecule. We 
introduce then the 
surface concentration 
in reduced cations a
s
.
 
Assuming that the creation of an oxygen 
vacancy results in the reduction of two adjacent Ce(1V) cations, 
we derive the following relationship: 
2 C b  = a, 
(9) 
3. Water Desorption. Water is desorbed from the surface by 
the recombination of hydrogen and a hydroxyl group. The rate 
of this water formation step, V3, is then 
where pH20 is the water partial pressure. 
4. Bulk Diffusion. The 
surface 
anionic vacancies diffuse inside 
the bulk of the solid according to step 4 of the scheme. The rate 
of this step can be expressed as 
where k4 
and k4 are diffusion constants, from the surface to the 
bulk and the bulk to the surface, respectively. a b  is the bulk 
concentration of reduced cationic sites. We assume therefore 
that the anionic vacancies are randomly distributed onto the 
surface, without any ordering in their distribution. This implies 
thus that diffusion occurs without preferential ways. Although 
reduced cerium dioxide is well-known to be able to order anionic 
vacancies,39 
we can justify this assumption by the low reductions 
(a 
I 
20%) that we obtain with our experimental conditions. 
Finally, we introduce the overall reduction a 
defined as the 
overall concentration (bulk and surface) of the reduced cations. 
a 
is a linear combination of the surface as 
and the bulk a b  
concentration of reduced cations according to 
AI.

we 
that (i) the surface is formed by an alternate array 
of anionic and cationic sites,~~o 
The (110) surface is a dense 
surface of this kind for a CaF2 cubic lattice like Ce02. 
Observations by electron microscopy suggest that they are the 
most prominent on sample A1.16 (ii) The stoichiometry of 
adsorption is one atomic hydrogen for one anion site. (iii) The 
hydrogen dissociation occurs exclusively on Ce4+ sites. (iv) 
Adsorbed molecular water is negligible at the high reaction 
temperature where the kinetics was carried out, and (v) lateral 
interactions between adjacent sites are neglected. FTIR inves- 
tigations carried out on 
samples A1 and A2 
provideus 
justification 
for some of these assumptions.12 The absence of any u(0H) 
band characteristic of adsorbed water above 673 K strongly 
supports point iv. Points ii and iii can be justified by the main 
occurrence of u(0H) bands of bidentate species adsorbed on 
Ce- 
(IV) cations at T values below 573 K and on 
Ce(II1) cations 
above 573 K. 
The 
kinetic rateof hydrogen dissociation, VI, 
can then be written 
as 
where OH and OoH represent the atomic hydrogen and hydroxyl 
group surface 
coverages, respectively; in this equation and further 
eqs 8 and 10, k
i
 and k-i (i = 1, 2, 3) are direct and inverse first- 
order kinetic constants of the step i of the reduction process, 
respectively. pH2 is the partial pressure of hydrogen. 
N , C + N , C = ~  
(13) 
where Nsc 
and Nbc are the relative content of surface and bulk 
cationic sites, respectively. For a solid of low surface area, Nsc 
<
<
 Nbc = 1 and a 
= 
(
Y
b
,
 but for a solid of high specific area such 
as the sample AI, 
Nsc 
becomes non-negligible compared to Nbc. 
To 
resolve the kinetic system represented by eqs 7-1 3, we must 
introduce an assumption concerning the rate-limiting step. 
Whatever the step i, we suppose that the rate of reduction can 
be expressed as 
2(da/dt) = 
(14) 
The resolution of this system is analytically possible only if the 
free anionic site coverage (1 - 
OH - 
OoH) largely exceeds the 
hydrogen and hydroxyl coverages. This assumption can be 
justified by the report that the H2O and H2 contents desorbed 
by TPR on 
sample A1 are low.12 The resolution of the system

represented by eqs 7-13 then leads to the differential eq 4: 
d a / ( a  - 
K )  = -k 
dt 
(4) 
where 
and 
s 
= N,c + 
K,(1 4;) 
K is a thermodynamic equilibrium constant at the given ratio of 
partial pressures (PHZ/PH20) weighted by a partition factor S. 
This partition factor given by eq 17 accounts for the probability 
distribution of the reduced cations 
between surface and bulk sites. 
In the differential eq 4 the rate constant k and the initial 
reduction at t = 0 differ according to the rate-limiting step i 
(Table 3). As we haveno 
prerequisite idea on 
it, we havedeveloped 
the rate-limiting-step condition for the four possible steps of the 
reduction process. An integration of the differential eq 4 leads 
to an expression of the form 
ln((K- a(t=O))/(K- 
a(t))) 
= kt 
(18) 
The calculated rate constants k and initial reduction a(,=o) 
are 
reported in Table 3. The initial reduction is quoted to 0 (step 1 
or 2) or A,(T) (step 3 or 4), the surface reduction at the 
temperature T, according to the rate-limiting step. 
Finally, several remarks 
can be made on 
the kinetic expressions 
of the reduction rate a(t). 
(1) The expressions obtained by considering steps 1 and 2 or 
steps 3 and 4 are exactly similar, except the initial reduction. We 
cannot distinguish then by this model which of the steps 1 or 2 
or steps 3 and 4 are limitative. Only experiments as a function 
of the partial pressures P H ~  
and PH~O 
allow a clear discrimination 
between them. 
(2) The reduction on 
pure ceria and 1.45 Rh/Ce02 samples 
was fitted according to this model. In 
the case of pure ceria, we 
can distinguish two domains with a break point. Within these 
two domains we fit independently the kinetic curves. This is 
possible as the rate of surface reduction is much larger than that 
of the bulk reduction. The parameters of these fits are reported 
in Table 4. An example of fit is reported in Figure 10. We note 
that the equilibrium constant K 
increases with the temperature 
and that the K values obtained at 673 K for Ce02 and Rh/CeO2 
are close. 
(3) The value of A,(T) at 673 K agrees well with a complete 
reduction of the surface (0.20 instead of 0.23, respectively). At 
lower temperatures, A,( T) 
is much lower. This indicates 
that the 
surface reduction is not completely achieved below 673 K. 
Finally, we need to estimate 
A,". This value provides an upper 
limit of the surface reduction process. This was performed by 
calculating the proportion of surface anionic sites as a function 
of the surface area. The number of surface anionic sites NsA 
has 
been calculated by Johnson and Mooi36asa functionof 
the number 
n of anionic sites 02- 
located on 
the edge of a ceria particle of 
cubic form: 
N t  
= (6n2 - 
12n + 8)/n3 
(19) 
We assume that NsA = 2N,C, both on 
the surface and inside 
the particle. If the ceria particle develops a surface area S~ET, 
n can be expressed as 
where F is a geometrical factor taking into account the number 
of faces exposed to the gas environment (F = 6 
for a cube), a is 
the diameter of the oxygen ion (0.28 nm), and d is the density 
of the material (7.13 g/cm3). 
From eqs 9 and 19, we can derivate the complete reduction of 
a surface layer A,", which is a close function of the surface area, 
according to eq 20: 
Asm 
= 2(6n2 - 
12n + 
8)/n3 =f(SBET) 
(21) 
A," values of 5% and 22% are calculated according to eq 16 
for samples A, and A2 of surface areas 125 and 8 m2/g, 
respectively.
