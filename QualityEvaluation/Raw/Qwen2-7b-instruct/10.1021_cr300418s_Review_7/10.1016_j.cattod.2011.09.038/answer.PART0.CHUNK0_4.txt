[1] "The interaction of O2 with rutile TiO2(1 1 0) depends strongly on the reduction state of the TiO2(1 1 0) crystal."
[2] "High-resolution STM studies revealed that the energy barrier for the non-vacancy-assisted, 2nd O2 dissociation channel decreases with increasing crystal reduction."
[3] "For high-reduced TiO2(1 1 0) crystals characterized by large terraces most O2 molecules desorb at 386 K, whereas O2 desorption is peaking at 410 K for low- and medium-reduced crystals."
[4] "Furthermore, the O2-TPD experiments revealed a highly non-linear behavior of the O2 desorption peak integrals as function of the crystal reduction state."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy (Ov) on the oxide surface, which then acts as an active site for the reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv typically indicates a higher reactivity and efficiency of the surface in promoting oxidation reactions due to the easier availability of the oxygen vacancy site. This mechanism facilitates the transfer of electrons and oxygen atoms between the oxide surface and reactants, enhancing the surface's capability to perform oxidative transformations efficiently.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及在氧化物表面形成氧空位（Ov），这随后作为反应的活性位点。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。较低的ΔEv通常表示表面在促进氧化反应方面的更高活性和效率，因为氧空位位点的可用性更高。这一机制促进了表面与反应物之间电子和氧原子的转移，增强了表面进行有效氧化转变的能力。
