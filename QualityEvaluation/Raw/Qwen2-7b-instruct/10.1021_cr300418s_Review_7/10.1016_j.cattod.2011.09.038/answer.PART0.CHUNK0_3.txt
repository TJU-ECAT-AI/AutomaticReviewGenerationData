[1] "It is generally accepted that adsorbed O2 species acquire negative charge upon adsorption on TiO2 surfaces."
[2] "The Ti3+ excess electrons populate the normally empty Ti 3d orbitals on cations in the near and far proximity of the structural defects, leading to a state in the 3.1 eV wide band gap."
[3] "The interaction of O2 with rutile TiO2(1 1 0) has been studied previously using STM, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and photoelectron spectroscopy (PES)."
[4] "The interaction of O2 with TiO2(1 1 0) depends strongly on the reduction state of the TiO2(1 1 0) crystal."
[5] "The energy barrier for the non-vacancy-assisted, 2nd O2 dissociation channel decreases with increasing crystal reduction."
[6] "Accompanying TPD studies revealed that the line shape of the O2-TPD peak occurring between 360 K and 450 K depends on the crystal reduction state."
[7] "Furthermore, the O2-TPD experiments revealed a highly non-linear behavior of the O2 desorption peak integrals as function of the crystal reduction state."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies as active sites for the reaction. Oxygen vacancy formation requires an energy (ΔEv) which influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. As the energy barrier for the non-vacancy-assisted, second oxygen dissociation channel decreases with increasing crystal reduction, this suggests that the presence of oxygen vacancies becomes more favorable under higher reduction states. This facilitates the oxygen vacancy formation, which is crucial for the mechanism's operation, enhancing both the surface's activity and its ability to catalyze oxidation reactions effectively.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为活性位点进行操作。氧空位的形成需要能量（ΔEv），这影响着氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。随着非氧空位辅助的第二氧解离能垒在晶粒还原度增加时降低，这表明在较高还原度下氧空位的存在变得更加有利。这促进了氧空位的形成，这对于机制的操作至关重要，从而增强了表面的活性及其有效催化氧化反应的能力。
