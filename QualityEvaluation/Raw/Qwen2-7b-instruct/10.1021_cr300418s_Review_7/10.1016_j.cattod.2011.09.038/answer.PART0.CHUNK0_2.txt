[1] "It is generally accepted that adsorbed O2 species acquire negative charge upon adsorption on TiO2 surfaces."
[2] "The Ti3+ excess electrons populate the normally empty Ti 3d orbitals on cations in the near and far proximity of the structural defects, leading to a state in the 3.1 eV wide band gap."
[3] "Considering that scanning tunneling microscopy studies addressing the anatase TiO2(101) surface revealed the absence of surface O vacancies."
[4] "The interaction of O2 with rutile TiO2(1 1 0) has been studied previously using STM, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and photoelectron spectroscopy (PES)."
[5] "Upon TiO2(1 1 0) sample preparation in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), the crystals are reduced, leading to the creation of bulk defects such as Ti interstitials and bridging O(Obr) vacancies on the surface."
[6] "The energy barrier for the non-vacancy-assisted, 2nd O2 dissociation channel decreases with increasing crystal reduction."
[7] "Accompanying TPD studies revealed that the line shape of the O2-TPD peak occurring between 360 K and 450 K depends on the crystal reduction state."
[8] "Furthermore, the O2-TPD experiments revealed a highly non-linear behavior of the O2 desorption peak integrals as function of the crystal reduction state."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it affects the stability and reactivity of the oxygen vacancy sites. Lower ΔEv values indicate easier formation of oxygen vacancies, which can enhance the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface due to increased surface reactivity and availability of active sites for the reaction.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物催化剂上的氧空位起作用。氧空位在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面至关重要。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）具有重要意义，因为它影响氧空位点的稳定性和反应性。较低的ΔEv值意味着氧空位更容易形成，这可以增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力，因为增加了表面反应性和活性位点的可用性以进行反应。
