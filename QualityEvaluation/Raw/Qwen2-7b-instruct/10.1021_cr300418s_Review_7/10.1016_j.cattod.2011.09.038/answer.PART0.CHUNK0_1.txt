[1] "It is generally accepted that adsorbed O2 species acquire negative charge upon adsorption on TiO2 surfaces."
[2] "The Ti3+ excess electrons populate the normally empty Ti 3d orbitals on cations in the near and far proximity of the structural defects, leading to a state in the 3.1 eV wide band gap."
[3] "However, which particular structural defects provide most of the Ti3+ excess electrons and are thus most relevant for the O2TiO2 interaction is today still unsettled."
[4] "To disentangle the contributions of the individual defects for chemical reactions on TiO2, the surface science approach is most promising."
[5] "For surface science studies addressing TiO2, the rutile TiO2(1 1 0)(1 × 1) surface has been often preferred (Fig. 1)."
[6] "Upon TiO2(1 1 0) sample preparation in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV), the crystals are reduced, leading to the creation of bulk defects such as Ti interstitials and bridging O(Obr) vacancies on the surface."
[7] "Considering that scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies addressing the anatase TiO2(101) surface revealed the absence of surface O vacancies, the formation of surface O vacancies in UHV may be a peculiar feature of rutile crystals."
[8] "The interaction of O2 with rutile TiO2(1 1 0) has been studied previously using STM, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and photoelectron spectroscopy (PES)."
[9] "It is found that the interaction of O2 with TiO2(1 1 0) depends strongly on the reduction state of the TiO2(1 1 0) crystal."
[10] "High-resolution STM studies revealed that the energy barrier for the non-vacancy-assisted, 2nd O2 dissociation channel decreases with increasing crystal reduction."
[11] "Additionally, it is found in the STM studies that the Ti interstitial diffusion is slightly more facile in high-reduced TiO2(1 1 0) crystals compared to low-reduced ones."
[12] "Accompanying TPD studies revealed that the line shape of the O2-TPD peak occurring between 360 K and 450 K depends on the crystal reduction state."
[13] "For high-reduced TiO2(1 1 0) crystals characterized by large terraces most O2 molecules desorb at 386 K, whereas O2 desorption is peaking at 410 K for low- and medium-reduced crystals."
[14] "Furthermore, the O2-TPD experiments revealed a highly non-linear behavior of the O2 desorption peak integrals as function of the crystal reduction state."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the oxygen vacancies as active sites for the reaction. Oxygen vacancies are created during the reduction process of the oxide surface, providing additional sites for the adsorption of oxygen molecules. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates easier formation of oxygen vacancies, potentially enhancing the catalytic efficiency due to increased active sites. However, the precise role of ΔEv in the mechanism's operation and its impact on the oxidizing ability remains uncertain and requires further investigation through surface science studies.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位作为反应活性位点来操作。在氧化物表面的还原过程中会形成氧空位，为吸附氧气分子提供额外的位点。氧空位形成的能量需求（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，可能增强催化效率，因为增加了活性位点。然而，ΔEv在机制操作中的确切作用及其对氧化能力的影响仍不确定，需要进一步通过表面科学研究进行调查。
