[1] "It is generally accepted that adsorbed O2 species acquire negative charge upon adsorption on TiO2 surfaces."
[2] "The Ti3+ excess electrons populate the normally empty Ti 3d orbitals on cations in the near and far proximity of the structural defects, leading to a state in the 3.1 eV wide band gap."
[3] "However, which particular structural defects provide most of the Ti3+ excess electrons and are thus most relevant for the O2TiO2 interaction is today still unsettled."
[4] "The interaction of O2 with rutile TiO2(1 1 0) has been studied previously using STM, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), and photoelectron spectroscopy (PES)."
[5] "The line shape of the O2-TPD peak occurring between 360 K and 450 K depends on the crystal reduction state."
[6] "For high-reduced TiO2(1 1 0) crystals characterized by large terraces most O2 molecules desorb at 386 K, whereas O2 desorption is peaking at 410 K for low- and medium-reduced crystals."
[7] "The O2-TPD experiments revealed a highly non-linear behavior of the O2 desorption peak integrals as a function of the crystal reduction state."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing oxygen vacancies to facilitate the transfer of oxygen atoms from the oxide surface to the reactants. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that oxygen vacancies are more readily formed, potentially enhancing the catalytic efficiency and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

2. The energy barrier for the non-vacancy-assisted, 2nd O2 dissociation channel decreases with increasing crystal reduction state of the TiO2(1 1 0) crystal. This implies that the reduction state of the crystal affects the ease with which oxygen molecules can dissociate and interact with the surface.

3. The interaction of O2 with rutile TiO2(1 1 0) is significantly influenced by the reduction state of the crystal. High-reduced TiO2(1 1 0) crystals show slightly easier Ti interstitial diffusion compared to low-reduced ones. Additionally, the line shape of the O2-TPD peak between 360 K and 450 K is dependent on the crystal reduction state, indicating a temperature-dependent desorption behavior.

4. In high-reduced TiO2(1 1 0) crystals with large terraces, most O2 molecules desorb at 386 K. In contrast, for low- and medium-reduced crystals, O2 desorption peaks at 410 K. This suggests that the crystal reduction state impacts the temperature at which oxygen molecules leave the surface.

5. The O2-TPD experiments reveal a highly nonlinear relationship between the O2 desorption peak integrals and the crystal reduction state. This implies that the desorption kinetics of oxygen are not linearly correlated with the degree of crystal reduction, potentially affecting the surface reactivity and stability under varying conditions.

1. 马斯-范克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位促进氧气原子从氧化物表面转移到反应物。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv意味着更容易形成氧空位，可能增强氧化物表面的催化效率和氧化能力。

2. 随着TiO2(1 1 0)晶体还原状态的增加，非氧空位辅助、第2个氧分子解离通道的能量壁垒减小。这表明晶体质地对氧分子与表面相互作用的难易程度有影响。

3. rutile TiO2(1 1 0)晶体的相互作用受其还原状态的影响。高还原状态的TiO2(1 1 0)晶体显示Ti空位扩散稍微容易。此外，在360 K至450 K之间的O2-TPD峰形状依赖于晶体质地状态，表明温度相关的脱附行为。

4. 在具有大型台阶的高还原状态TiO2(1 1 0)晶体中，大多数O2分子在386 K脱附。相比之下，低和中还原状态的晶体中，O2脱附峰值在410 K。这表明晶体质地影响氧气分子离开表面的温度。

5. O2-TPD实验揭示了O2脱附峰积分与晶体质地状态之间高度非线性关系。这意味着在不同条件下，表面反应性和稳定性可能不受线性相关影响。
