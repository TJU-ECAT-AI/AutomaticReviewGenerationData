The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv signifies the energy needed for oxygen to leave the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. This process affects the surface's ability to adsorb and oxidize reactants. The higher the ΔEv, the more energy is required for oxygen to desorb, potentially reducing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a lower ΔEv allows for easier desorption of oxygen, enhancing the surface's ability to catalyze reactions effectively.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv表示氧从氧化物表面脱附所需的能量，创建氧空位。这一过程影响了表面吸附和氧化反应物的能力。ΔEv越高，氧脱附需要更多的能量，可能降低表面的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv允许更容易地脱附氧，增强表面有效催化反应的能力。
