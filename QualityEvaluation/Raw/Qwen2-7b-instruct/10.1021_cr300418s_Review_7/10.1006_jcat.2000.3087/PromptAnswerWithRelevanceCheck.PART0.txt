<quotes>
[1] "The calculations illustrate both the variations in chemical activity from one transition metal to the next and the effect of geometry."
[2] "The results show that, even though the accuracy of DFT calculations is not at present sufficient to predict absolute chemical reaction rates, it is good enough to predict the overall variations in rates from one system to the next."
[3] "The consequences of the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation in terms of the kinetics of the ammonia synthesis process under industrial conditions are discussed, and it is shown that the relation leads to a volcano-type dependence of the catalytic activity on the nitrogen heat of adsorption."
[4] "Fe and Ru are near the maximum, closely resembling what is found experimentally (12)."
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The Brnsted-Evans-Polanyi relation shows a linear relationship between the activation energy for N2 dissociation and the nitrogen chemisorption energy across a wide range of transition metals, confirming its validity in heterogeneous catalysis. This relation also depends on the structure of the active site, leading to a volcano curve that describes the catalytic activity based on the nitrogen heat of adsorption.

2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, when applied to the ammonia synthesis process, can predict the relative catalytic activity of different transition metals. Iron (Fe) and ruthenium (Ru) are among the best choices for catalysts, matching experimental findings closely.

3. The volcano curve indicates that the maximum in activity is a compromise between a high sticking probability (low barrier for N2 dissociation) and a large number of free sites (low N and NH coverage) where reaction can occur.

1. 布恩斯德-埃文斯-波拉尼关系表明，氮气解离的活化能与吸附在各种过渡金属表面的氮原子的化学吸附能之间存在线性关系，这证实了该关系在异相催化中的有效性。这种关系还依赖于活性位点的结构，导致一种火山曲线描述了根据氮的吸附热吸附的催化活性。

2. 当应用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算到氨合成过程中时，可以预测不同过渡金属的相对催化活性。铁（Fe）和铑（Ru）是最佳催化剂选择之一，与实验结果高度吻合。

3. 火山曲线表明，活动的最大值是在高粘附概率（N2解离障碍低）和大量自由位点（N和NH覆盖率低）之间的一种妥协，反应可以在这些位点发生。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv signifies the energy needed for oxygen to leave the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. This process affects the surface's ability to adsorb and oxidize reactants. The higher the ΔEv, the more energy is required for oxygen to desorb, potentially reducing the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a lower ΔEv allows for easier desorption of oxygen, enhancing the surface's ability to catalyze reactions effectively.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。ΔEv表示氧从氧化物表面脱附所需的能量，创建氧空位。这一过程影响了表面吸附和氧化反应物的能力。ΔEv越高，氧脱附需要更多的能量，可能降低表面的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv允许更容易地脱附氧，增强表面有效催化反应的能力。
