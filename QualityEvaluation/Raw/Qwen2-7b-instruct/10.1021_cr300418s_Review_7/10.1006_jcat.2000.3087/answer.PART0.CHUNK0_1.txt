1. Density functional calculations demonstrate an essentially linear connection between the activation energy for N2 dissociation and the binding energy of atomic nitrogen on various transition metal surfaces.
2. Our plane wave DFT method with nonlocal treatment of exchange and correlation effects was utilized for calculating the activation barrier (Ea) for N2 dissociation and the adsorption energy (1E) for dissociative N2 adsorption across a range of transition metals.
3. The findings presented in Figure 1 enable estimation of the relative ammonia synthesis rates over different transition metals.
