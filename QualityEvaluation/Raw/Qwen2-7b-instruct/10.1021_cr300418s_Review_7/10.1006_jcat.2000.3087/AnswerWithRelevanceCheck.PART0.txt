          [1] "The calculations illustrate both the variations in chemical activity from one transition metal to the next and the effect of geometry."
          [2] "The results show that, even though the accuracy of DFT calculations is not at present sufficient to predict absolute chemical reaction rates, it is good enough to predict the overall variations in rates from one system to the next."
          [3] "The consequences of the BrnstedEvansPolanyi relation in terms of the kinetics of the ammonia synthesis process under industrial conditions are discussed, and it is shown that the relation leads to a volcano-type dependence of the catalytic activity on the nitrogen heat of adsorption."
          [4] "Fe and Ru are near the maximum, closely resembling what is found experimentally (12)."

          The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This mechanism relies on the energy needed for oxygen to leave the oxide surface, creating an oxygen vacancy. This process affects the surface's ability to adsorb and oxidize reactants. The higher the ΔEv, the more energy is required for oxygen to desorb, which can potentially reduce the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. Conversely, a lower ΔEv allows for easier desorption of oxygen, enhancing the surface's ability to catalyze reactions effectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations can predict the relative catalytic activity of different transition metals, with iron (Fe) and ruthenium (Ru) being among the best choices for catalysts, matching experimental findings closely.

          火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制依赖于氧气从氧化物表面脱附所需的能量，从而形成氧空位。这一过程影响了表面吸附和氧化反应物的能力。ΔEv越高，氧脱附需要更多的能量，可能降低表面的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv允许更轻松地脱附氧，增强表面有效催化反应的能力。密度泛函理论（DFT）计算可以预测不同过渡金属的相对催化活性，其中铁（Fe）和铑（Ru）是最佳催化剂选择之一，与实验结果高度吻合。
