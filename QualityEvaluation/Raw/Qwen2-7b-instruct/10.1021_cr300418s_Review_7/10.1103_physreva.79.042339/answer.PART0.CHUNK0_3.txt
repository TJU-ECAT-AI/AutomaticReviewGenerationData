This protocol allows for the direct transfer of quantum states between the first node and the end of a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide, utilizing either Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages (STIRAP). It relies on the effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the cavity modes between the atoms. Raman transitions occur under specific conditions related to the energy levels of the atoms. The protocol ensures that quantum information is transferred without involving the intermediate nodes. The fidelity of the state transfer is affected by the probabilities of populating atomic excited states or cavity modes.

这个方案允许在一维耦合谐振器波导的首节点和末端之间直接传输量子状态，利用的是拉曼过渡或受激拉曼绝热通过（STIRAP）。它依赖于腔模式在原子之间的有效远距离偶极偶极相互作用。在特定条件下，原子的能量级允许发生拉曼过渡。该协议确保信息传输不涉及中间节点。状态转移的信度受到填充原子激发态或腔模式的概率的影响。
