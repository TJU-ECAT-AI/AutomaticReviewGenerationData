Quantum information can be transferred efficiently in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide using Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages. The scheme relies on long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by cavity modes. This method allows direct transfer between opposite ends of the waveguide without involving intermediate nodes. Experimentally, this protocol can be implemented using current technology.

在单维耦合谐振子波导中，量子信息可以通过拉曼跃迁或受激拉曼绝热通过直接传输。该方案依赖于由腔模式介导的有效远距离偶极-偶极相互作用。这种方法允许两端之间直接传输，而无需涉及中间节点。实验上，可以使用当前的技术实现这一协议。
