[1] "We propose an efficient scheme for the implementation of quantum information transfer in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide."
[2] "We show that, based on the effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions between the atoms mediated by the cavity modes, Raman transitions between the atoms trapped in different nodes can take place."
[3] "Quantum information could be transferred directly between the opposite ends of the coupled waveguide without involving the intermediate nodes via either Raman transitions or the stimulated Raman adiabatic passages."
[4] "This proposal exploits the effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by the cavity modes between the atoms."
[5] "Experimentally this protocol could be realized with the state-of-the-art technology."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy barrier determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv values result in slower activation of the reaction, affecting the catalytic efficiency, while lower values facilitate faster reaction rates.

火星-范克雷尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来运作。这个能量壁垒决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。更高的ΔEv值导致反应激活速度较慢，影响催化效率，而较低的值则促进更快的反应速率。
