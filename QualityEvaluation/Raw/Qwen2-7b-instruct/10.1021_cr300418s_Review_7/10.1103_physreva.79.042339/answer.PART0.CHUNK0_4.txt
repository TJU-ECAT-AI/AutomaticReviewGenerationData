Quantum-information transfer (QIT) in a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide is achieved by utilizing the effective long-range dipole-dipole interactions mediated by cavity modes between trapped atoms. This allows quantum information to be transferred directly between the opposite ends of the waveguide without involving the intermediate nodes. The transfer is facilitated through Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages. Each node in the waveguide contains a cavity and a trapped three-state atom. Alice, located at the first node, transfers an unknown quantum state to Bob, positioned at the end, through the waveguide. The transfer is completed when the couplings are turned off, enabling Bob to retrieve the state. However, the fidelity of the state transfer is reduced due to the small probabilities of populating either the atomic excited states or the cavity modes.

在单维耦合谐振器波导中实现量子信息传输（QIT）是通过利用腔模式介导的原子之间的有效长程偶极偶极相互作用来实现的。这使得量子信息可以直接在波导的两端之间传输，而无需涉及中间节点。传输通过拉曼跃迁或受激拉曼绝热过门来促进。波导中的每个节点都包含一个腔和一个被囚禁的三态原子。爱丽丝位于第一个节点处，通过波导向位于终端的鲍勃转移未知量子状态。当断开连接时，完成转移使鲍勃能够检索状态。但是，由于填充原子激发态或腔模式的概率较小，因此转移的信度会降低。
