Quantum information can be transferred efficiently between opposite ends of a one-dimensional coupled resonator waveguide through Raman transitions or stimulated Raman adiabatic passages, bypassing intermediate nodes. This protocol offers applications in quantum information processing like entanglement distribution, teleportation, and distributed quantum computation. Experimental realization is feasible with current technology. Alice aims to transfer an arbitrary quantum state from the first node to the last node using this method.
