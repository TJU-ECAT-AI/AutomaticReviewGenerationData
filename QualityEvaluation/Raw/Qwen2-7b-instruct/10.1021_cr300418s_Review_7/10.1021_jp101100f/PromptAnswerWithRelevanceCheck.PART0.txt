[1] "In this paper, we explore whether such approach, in which two different values for the U parameter are needed, is robust enough so that the main conclusions do not depend substantially on the specific choice of the parameters, as far as they are larger than a minimum value allowing for a correct description of electron localization."
[2] "The calculated values of ΔGf(0,p0) for the four solid solutions are reported in Table 2."
[3] "This electronic effect is at the basis of the enhanced O-buffering effect of ceria induced by Ni defects in NiO/CeO2 solid solutions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring a certain amount of energy for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv indicates a greater barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, which can reduce the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Conversely, a lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

[1] "In all cases, Ni-doping significantly enhances the O buffering effect of ceria, controlled by O vacancy formation, but the actual microscopic mechanisms are different depending on the specific type and charge state of the point defects."
[2] "The calculated values of ΔGf(0,p0) for the four solid solutions are reported in Table 2."
[3] "Quite importantly, this analysis of the relative stability of the solid solutions depends very weakly on the values of the Hubbard U parameters employed in the DFT+U calculations; hence the conclusions presented above are not affected by the particular choice of U values, as far as they are large enough to capture correctly electron localization effects in reduced ceria (i.e., U > 2 eV)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to determine both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This energy barrier affects how easily oxygen can be released or taken up during the reaction, influencing the reaction rate and selectivity.

The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in controlling the reaction pathway. A higher ΔEv indicates a more stable oxygen vacancy state, which can hinder the reaction process, whereas a lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen release or uptake, enhancing the reaction's effectiveness. This mechanism is crucial for understanding and optimizing catalytic processes involving oxide surfaces.

The stability and reactivity of the oxide surface, as influenced by ΔEv, directly correlate with the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. By manipulating the conditions to control ΔEv, one can potentially improve the performance of oxide catalysts in various applications.

These conclusions about the role of ΔEv in the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism are robust across a wide range of computational parameters, ensuring the reliability of the findings.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧气空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一能量壁垒影响了氧气释放或吸收的容易程度，从而影响反应速率和选择性。

ΔEv的重要性在于它控制着反应途径的作用。较高的ΔEv表明氧气空位状态更为稳定，这可能阻碍反应过程，而较低的ΔEv则有利于更轻松地释放或吸收氧气，增强反应的有效性。这一机制对于理解并优化涉及氧化物表面的催化过程至关重要。

氧化物表面的稳定性和反应性，受ΔEv的影响直接决定了催化活性和氧化能力。通过调节条件来控制ΔEv，有可能提高氧化物催化剂在各种应用中的性能。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These O vacancies play a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in this process. In the context of this literature, the formation of O vacancies is influenced by the type and charge state of point defects introduced by nickel (Ni) doping in ceria (CeO2). Specifically, interstitial Ni+ defects cause a charge redistribution, forming Ni+Ce3+ defect complexes, while substitutional Ni2+ defects lead to the appearance of unoccupied gap states on the O atoms neighboring the Ni defect. The stability of solid solutions with Ni defects depends on the presence of O vacancies and the type of Ni defects. Solid solutions with substitutional Ni2+ defects are more stable than those with interstitial Ni+ defects by more than 2.3 eV, indicating a higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability controlled by the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物形成氧空位（O空位）来运作。这些O空位在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于这个过程至关重要。根据本文献，氧空位的形成受到掺杂到氧化铈（CeO2）中的镍（Ni）缺陷类型和电荷状态的影响。具体而言，间位Ni+缺陷导致电荷重分布，形成Ni+Ce3+缺陷复合体，而置换Ni2+缺陷导致Ni缺陷附近O原子上出现未占据的能带间隙。固溶体中Ni缺陷的存在取决于氧空位的存在和Ni缺陷的类型。含有置换Ni2+缺陷的固溶体比含有间位Ni+离子的固溶体更稳定，超过2.3 eV，这表明由氧空位形成能量控制的更高的催化活性和氧化能力。
