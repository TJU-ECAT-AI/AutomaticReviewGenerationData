[1] "Despite the importance of such processes, there is still relatively little understanding of the underlying mechanism at the microscopic level."
[2] "The presence of substitutional Ni point defects is shown to result in Ni2+ ions, which are the most commonly observed defects in Niceria systems."
[3] "These solid solutions involving interstitial Ni ions are predicted to become thermodynamically more stable than those containing substitutional defects only in extreme conditions of temperature and O2 partial pressure."
[4] "Our analysis shows that these conclusions are robust with respect to the specific values of the U parameters used in the calculations and are valid for a wide range of U values."

1. The underlying mechanism of the Mars-van Krevelen process in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions is not fully understood, especially at the microscopic level.
2. The most common defect observed in ceria systems is the Ni2+ ion, which occurs due to the presence of substitutional Ni point defects.
3. Solid solutions with interstitial Ni ions are predicted to become thermodynamically more stable under extreme conditions of temperature and oxygen partial pressure compared to those with substitutional defects.
4. The conclusions regarding the enhanced oxygen buffering effect of ceria induced by Ni defects are robust and valid across a broad range of values for the U parameters used in the calculations.

1. 对于氧化物催化氧化反应中的Mars-van Krevelen过程的微观机制，目前了解仍然较少。
2. 在铈系统中观察到的最常见缺陷是Ni2+离子，这发生在掺杂有置换型Ni点缺陷的情况下。
3. 含有间隙态Ni离子的固溶体在极端温度和氧气分压条件下比仅含有置换缺陷的体系更加热力学稳定。
4. 关于Ni缺陷增强铈的氧缓冲能力的结论对计算中使用的特定U参数值具有鲁棒性，并且在广泛的U值范围内有效。
