[1] "In this paper, we explore whether such approach, in which two different values for the U parameter are needed, is robust enough so that the main conclusions do not depend substantially on the specific choice of the parameters, as far as they are larger than a minimum value allowing for a correct description of electron localization."
[2] "The calculated values of ΔGf(0,p0) for the four solid solutions are reported in Table 2."
[3] "This electronic effect is at the basis of the enhanced O-buffering effect of ceria induced by Ni defects in NiO/CeO2 solid solutions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by requiring a certain amount of energy for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv indicates a greater barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, which can reduce the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. Conversely, a lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, potentially enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过要求一定的能量来形成氧空位（ΔEv）起作用。这种能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。更高的ΔEv表示形成氧空位的障碍更大，这可能降低氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，较低的ΔEv有利于更轻松地形成氧空位，可能增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
