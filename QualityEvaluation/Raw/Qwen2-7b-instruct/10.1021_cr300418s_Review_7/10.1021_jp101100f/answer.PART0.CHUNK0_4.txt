[1] "In all cases, Ni-doping significantly enhances the O buffering effect of ceria, controlled by O vacancy formation, but the actual microscopic mechanisms are different depending on the specific type and charge state of the point defects."
[2] "The oxidation state of the Ni dopant is shown to univocally characterize the type of defect, whether interstitial (Ni+) or substitutional (Ni2+)."
[3] "Interstitial Ni+ defects result from a charge redistribution between the Ni and Ce cations that leads to the formation of characteristic Ni+Ce3+ defect complexes."
[4] "Substitutional Ni2+ point defects yield unsaturated O 2p valence bands and the appearance of unoccupied gap states spatially localized on the O atoms neighboring the Ni defect."
[5] "At the reference pressure, the solid solutions consisting of substitutional Ni2+ point defects result to be considerably more stable (by more than 2.3 eV) than those consisting of interstitial Ni+ ions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the oxide surface. These O vacancies play a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in this process. In the context of this literature, the formation of O vacancies is influenced by the type and charge state of point defects introduced by nickel (Ni) doping in ceria (CeO2). Specifically, interstitial Ni+ defects cause a charge redistribution, forming Ni+Ce3+ defect complexes, while substitutional Ni2+ defects lead to the appearance of unoccupied gap states on the O atoms neighboring the Ni defect. The stability of solid solutions with Ni defects depends on the presence of O vacancies and the type of Ni defects. Solid solutions with substitutional Ni2+ defects are more stable than those with interstitial Ni+ defects by more than 2.3 eV, indicating a higher catalytic activity and oxidizing ability controlled by the energy of oxygen vacancy formation.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过表面氧化物形成氧空位（O空位）来运作。这些O空位在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于这个过程至关重要。根据本文献，氧空位的形成受到掺杂到氧化铈（CeO2）中的镍（Ni）缺陷类型和电荷状态的影响。具体而言，间位Ni+缺陷导致电荷重分布，形成Ni+Ce3+缺陷复合体，而置换Ni2+缺陷导致Ni缺陷附近O原子上出现未占据的能带间隙。固溶体中Ni缺陷的存在取决于氧空位的存在和Ni缺陷的类型。含有置换Ni2+缺陷的固溶体比含有间位Ni+离子的固溶体更稳定，超过2.3 eV，这表明由氧空位形成能量控制的更高的催化活性和氧化能力。
