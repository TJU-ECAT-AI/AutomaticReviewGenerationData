[1] "In all cases, Ni-doping significantly enhances the O buffering effect of ceria, controlled by O vacancy formation, but the actual microscopic mechanisms are different depending on the specific type and charge state of the point defects."
[2] "The calculated values of ΔGf(0,p0) for the four solid solutions are reported in Table 2."
[3] "Quite importantly, this analysis of the relative stability of the solid solutions depends very weakly on the values of the Hubbard U parameters employed in the DFT+U calculations; hence the conclusions presented above are not affected by the particular choice of U values, as far as they are large enough to capture correctly electron localization effects in reduced ceria (i.e., U > 2 eV)."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to drive the reaction. The significance of ΔEv lies in its role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Higher ΔEv indicates a greater barrier for oxygen vacancy formation, which can reduce the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Conversely, a lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, potentially increasing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来驱动反应。ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面具有重要意义。更高的ΔEv意味着氧空位形成需要更大的障碍，这可能降低氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。相反，更低的ΔEv使氧空位形成更容易，可能增加氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
