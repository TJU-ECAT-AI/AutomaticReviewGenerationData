[1] "The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "The oxygen atoms 1 and 2 are bridging oxygens and 3 to 6 are in-plane oxygens."
[4] "The desorption energies of the CO2 formed by CO binding to the oxygens O1, O2, and O3, are 0.2, 0.3, and 0.1 eV, respectively."
[5] "On the AuxTi1xO2(110), CO binds most strongly to the oxygen atoms most weakened by the presence of gold, and forms an adsorbed CO2 molecule."
[6] "After the surface oxygen 1 is removed, the surface oxygen 2 can react with CO, to form a CO2 molecule, which desorbs from the surface, leaving behind a second bridging-oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released when an oxygen atom is removed from the oxide surface to facilitate the oxidation of a substrate molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a weaker bond between the surface oxygen atoms and the oxide, making the surface more reactive and thus enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This process allows for efficient conversion of the substrate molecule into products, driven by the energy released upon oxygen vacancy creation.

火星-克雷威尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用从氧化物表面移除氧原子时释放的能量来促进基质分子的氧化。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明表面氧原子与氧化物之间的结合较弱，使表面更加活跃，从而增强催化活性和氧化能力。这一过程允许通过氧空位生成释放的能量高效地将基质分子转化为产物。
