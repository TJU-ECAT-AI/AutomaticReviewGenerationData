[1] "We used density functional theory to examine whether doping oxides makes them better oxidation catalysts."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "These calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."
[4] "We have calculated the energy (Evf) required for removing one of the oxygen atoms to form a vacancy in the surface layer and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase."
[5] "On the AuxTi1xO2(110), CO binds most strongly to the oxygen atoms most weakened by the presence of gold, and forms an adsorbed CO2 molecule."
[6] "O2 binds more weakly on an bridging-oxygen vacancy on the Au-doped (DeO2  0:68 eV) than on a pure TiO2(110) surface (DeO2  2:80 eV)."
[7] "After adsorption, the oxygen molecule reacts with gas-phase CO to form a carbonate (figure 1e), with a very substantial release of energy (about 4 eV)."
[8] "One may presume that a dopant that makes it very easy to remove oxygen, will slow down the annihilation of the oxygen vacancy."
[9] "In the case when the dopant has a lower charge than the ions of the host (e.g., Au3+ replacing Ti4+ in TiO2) the oxygen atoms surrounding the dopant see an electron deficit (a hole)."
[10] "After the surface oxygen 1 is removed, the surface oxygen 2 can react with CO, to form a CO2 molecule, which desorbs from the surface, leaving behind a second bridging-oxygen vacancy."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface. Oxygen atoms are removed from the surface to create this vacancy, and the oxygen vacancy becomes reactive. Gas-phase oxygen then fills the vacancy, forming an oxide species. Simultaneously, another reactant (such as CO) adsorbs onto the oxide surface, leading to the formation of a reactive intermediate. This intermediate reacts with the newly formed oxide species to produce the desired product (such as CO2). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of the oxygen vacancy, which could lead to a more active and efficient catalyst. However, the balance between the ease of oxygen removal and the stability of the catalyst is critical. A catalyst that allows for too rapid removal of oxygen atoms might compromise the stability of the catalyst, leading to neutral dopant atoms being formed.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及在氧化物表面上形成氧空位。从表面移除氧原子以产生这个空位，氧空位变得活性。气体相氧随后填充空位，形成氧化物物种。同时，另一个反应物（如CO）吸附到氧化物表面上，导致形成一个活性中间体。这个中间体与新形成的氧化物种反应生成所需的产品（如CO2）。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。ΔEv较低表明氧空位的形成更为容易，这可能导致更活跃且高效的催化剂。然而，氧原子快速移除与催化剂稳定性之间的平衡是关键的。允许氧原子过快移除的催化剂可能会损害催化剂的稳定性，导致形成中性掺杂原子。
