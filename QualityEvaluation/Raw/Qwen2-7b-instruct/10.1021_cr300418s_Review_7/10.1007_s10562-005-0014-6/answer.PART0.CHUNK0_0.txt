[1] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."
[2] "The calculations suggest that it is worthwhile to explore doped oxides as oxidation catalysts."
[3] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the transfer of electrons from the oxidized species to the reducing agent, typically through an intermediate species like water."
[4] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, with lower ΔEv indicating higher reactivity."
[5] "The oxidizing power of the system is reduced dramatically when the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide is weakened due to doping."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves electron transfer from the oxidized species to the reducing agent, often facilitated by an intermediate species like water. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest higher reactivity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. By weakening the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide through doping, the system's oxidizing power is significantly reduced.

火星-克雷弗伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧化物种向还原剂的电子转移，通常通过中间物种如水来实现。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物表面具有更高的活性和氧化能力。通过掺杂削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，系统的氧化能力会显著降低。
