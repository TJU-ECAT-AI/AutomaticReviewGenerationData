The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reactant by a metal oxide catalyst, followed by the transfer of the oxygen atom from the metal oxide to another molecule, typically water or another reducing agent. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide surface is more reactive, facilitating the oxidation process. The energy difference between doped oxides (such as TiO2 doped with Cu vs. Au) can accurately predict which dopant leads to more effective reduction of the oxide, suggesting that conclusions drawn from energy differences are likely to be reliable.

火星-范克雷伦机制涉及由金属氧化物催化剂氧化反应物的过程，随后是将氧原子从金属氧化物转移到另一个分子，通常是水或其他还原剂。表面氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧化物表面更活跃，有利于氧化过程。不同掺杂氧化物之间的能量差异（如掺杂有Cu的TiO2与Au相比）可以准确预测哪种掺杂剂导致氧化物的更有效还原，这表明从能量差异得出的结论可能是可靠的。
