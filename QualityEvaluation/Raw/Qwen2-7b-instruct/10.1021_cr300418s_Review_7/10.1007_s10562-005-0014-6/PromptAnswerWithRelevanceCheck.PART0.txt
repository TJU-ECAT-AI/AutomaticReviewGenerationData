The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves electron transfer from the oxidized species to the reducing agent, often facilitated by an intermediate species like water. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a critical role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values suggest higher reactivity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. By weakening the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide through doping, the system's oxidizing power is significantly reduced.

火星-克雷弗伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及氧化物种向还原剂的电子转移，通常通过中间物种如水来实现。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力起着决定性作用。较低的ΔEv值表明氧化物表面具有更高的活性和氧化能力。通过掺杂削弱表面氧与氧化物之间的键，系统的氧化能力会显著降低。

[1] "The oxidation takes place by a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism."
[2] "We show that doping with Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, Pd, Ni reduces dramatically the bond of surface oxygen to titania or ceria, making them better oxidation catalysts."
[3] "The oxygen atoms 1 and 2 are bridging oxygens and 3 to 6 are in-plane oxygens."
[4] "The desorption energies of the CO2 formed by CO binding to the oxygens O1, O2, and O3, are 0.2, 0.3, and 0.1 eV, respectively."
[5] "On the AuxTi1xO2(110), CO binds most strongly to the oxygen atoms most weakened by the presence of gold, and forms an adsorbed CO2 molecule."
[6] "After the surface oxygen 1 is removed, the surface oxygen 2 can react with CO, to form a CO2 molecule, which desorbs from the surface, leaving behind a second bridging-oxygen vacancy."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released when an oxygen atom is removed from the oxide surface to facilitate the oxidation of a substrate molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a weaker bond between the surface oxygen atoms and the oxide, making the surface more reactive and thus enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability. This process allows for efficient conversion of the substrate molecule into products, driven by the energy released upon oxygen vacancy creation.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy on the oxide surface. Oxygen atoms are removed from the surface to create this vacancy, and the oxygen vacancy becomes reactive. Gas-phase oxygen then fills the vacancy, forming an oxide species. Simultaneously, another reactant (such as CO) adsorbs onto the oxide surface, leading to the formation of a reactive intermediate. This intermediate reacts with the newly formed oxide species to produce the desired product (such as CO2). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more facile formation of the oxygen vacancy, which could lead to a more active and efficient catalyst. However, the balance between the ease of oxygen removal and the stability of the catalyst is critical. A catalyst that allows for too rapid removal of oxygen atoms might compromise the stability of the catalyst, leading to neutral dopant atoms being formed.

火星-克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中涉及在氧化物表面上形成氧空位。从表面移除氧原子以产生这个空位，氧空位变得活性。气体相氧随后填充空位，形成氧化物物种。同时，另一个反应物（如CO）吸附到氧化物表面上，导致形成一个活性中间体。这个中间体与新形成的氧化物种反应生成所需的产品（如CO2）。氧空位形成的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。ΔEv较低表明氧空位的形成更为容易，这可能导致更活跃且高效的催化剂。然而，氧原子快速移除与催化剂稳定性之间的平衡是关键的。允许氧原子过快移除的催化剂可能会损害催化剂的稳定性，导致形成中性掺杂原子。

[2] "We conclude with a note of caution regarding the accuracy of GGA-DFT calculations for oxide chemistry. The error is caused by the electron self-interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d-or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms."
[3] "We propose that removing two oxygen atoms from the surface facilitates the conversion of the ion to a neutral Au atom."
[4] "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the weakening of the bond between oxygen atoms in the oxide's top surface layer and the oxide itself due to the presence of dopants. This leads to an increase in the reactivity of oxygen vacancies and the molecules adsorbed at these sites. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more efficient catalyst, as it allows for easier formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies in the oxidation process.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the oxidation of a reactant by a metal oxide catalyst, followed by the transfer of the oxygen atom from the metal oxide to another molecule, typically water or another reducing agent. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the oxide surface is more reactive, facilitating the oxidation process. The energy difference between doped oxides (such as TiO2 doped with Cu vs. Au) can accurately predict which dopant leads to more effective reduction of the oxide, suggesting that conclusions drawn from energy differences are likely to be reliable.
