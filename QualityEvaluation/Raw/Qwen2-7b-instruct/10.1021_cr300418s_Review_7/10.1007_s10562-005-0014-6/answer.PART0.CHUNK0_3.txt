[1] "The essential elements of the oxidation mechanism proposed here involve the weakening, by the dopant, of the bond between the oxygen atoms in the top surface layer and the oxide, and the reactivity of the oxygen vacancy and of the molecules adsorbed at an oxygen vacancy site."
[2] "We conclude with a note of caution regarding the accuracy of GGA-DFT calculations for oxide chemistry. The error is caused by the electron self-interaction in DFT, which favors the delocalization of the electron in the d-or f-bands where the electron should be localized on individual atoms."
[3] "We propose that removing two oxygen atoms from the surface facilitates the conversion of the ion to a neutral Au atom."
[4] "A good catalyst in this class must strike a balance between the ability to donate an oxygen atom during oxidation, and that of taking oxygen from the gas phase to heal the oxygen vacancy formed by the oxidation reaction."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the weakening of the bond between oxygen atoms in the oxide's top surface layer and the oxide itself due to the presence of dopants. This leads to an increase in the reactivity of oxygen vacancies and the molecules adsorbed at these sites. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates a more efficient catalyst, as it allows for easier formation and utilization of oxygen vacancies in the oxidation process.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中的作用涉及由于掺杂剂的存在，氧化物顶层表面层中的氧原子之间的键被削弱。这导致氧空位和吸附在其上的分子的活性增加。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表示更高效的催化剂，因为它允许更容易地形成和利用氧化物表面的氧空位进行氧化过程。
