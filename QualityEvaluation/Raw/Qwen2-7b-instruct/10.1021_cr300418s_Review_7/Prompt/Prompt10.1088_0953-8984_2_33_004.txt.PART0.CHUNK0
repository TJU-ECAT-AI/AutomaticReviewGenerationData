I'm going to give you a scientific literature. Then I'm going to ask you some questions about it. I'd like you to first write down exact quotes of parts of the document word by word that would help answer the question, and then I'd like you to answer the question using facts from the quoted content. Do not omit any relevant information from the text, and avoid introducing any falsehoods or assumptions that aren't directly supported by the literature.

New high-temperature results on the ionic conductivity of quartz and implications on the transport mechanisms M Martini, A Palearii, G Spinolo and A Vedda Dipartimento di Fisica dellUniversit6, via Celoria 16,20133 Milano, Italy Received 21 December 1989,in final form 2 May 1990 Abstract. AC (lo2-3 X lo5 Hz) measurements have been performed on Sawyer premium- quality synthetic quartz oriented along the z axis, in the temperature range between 240 and 1500 K. The samples were both as-received and x-rayed, in the case of the lower- temperature measurements.
The results confirm that the conductivity, in the temperature range considered, is essen- tially due to extrinsic phenomena, i.e. to the dissociation of AI-Na substitutional centres and to the migration process of alkali ions.
An interpretative scheme is proposed, which involves the detailed structure of the attractive potential of a Na ion in the vicinity of an aluminium impurity and the increase in the radius of the z-axis channels in the P-quartz-to-tridymite transition.
1. Introduction
Years ago Hughes [l] demonstrated that a low-temperature (300 K) anisotropic slow conductivity of ionic character takes place in irradiated quartz. Alkali ions liberated by x-irradiation from aluminium impurity centres were held responsible for such a charge transport process, and the activation energy of these ions turned out to be 0.27 eV. Such radiation-induced conductivity (RIC) was later studied by Jain and Nowick [2]. It was found that the phenomenon that annealed out at room temperature in few hours could be frozen in at temperatures below 0 C;in such conditions, Li and Na-electrodiffused quartz, studied by Green et d [ 3 ] yielded a migration energy 0.26 eV <
E, <
0.34
eV with barely detectable differences between Na and Li. Also the RIC annealing mechanism was studied and has been related to the phosphorescence that occurs in irradiated quartz The ionic AC and DC conductivity at T > 500 K was studied by several workers whose results are commented upon in a recent paper of ours [5] (see references therein).In summary, DC studies at 400 K <
T <
800 K, mostly performed on natural quartz oriented along the z axis, showed that the transport process had an activation energy ranging between 0.77 and 1.61 eV; however, these results are subject to criticism owing to the presence of polarisation effects and of electrodiffusion phenomena (sweeping), AC conductance studies were carried out on both natural and synthetic oriented samples at 400 K < T < 800 K; the activation energy E of the process, which equals

1.3 eV, has been interpreted as a linear combination of the association energy E, of the
Al-Mpair and of the migration energy E, of the alkali ion. Our AC results [5] on synthetic oriented quartz confirmed up to 800K the data in the literature and extended the explored temperature range up to 1200 K; a new lower activation energy E of 0.67 eV was found between 800 and 1200 K.
The difference between the low-temperature slope, 1.3 eV, and the high-tem- perature slope, 0.67 eV, was interpreted by considering that at low T the conductance mechanism is governed by additional unassociated aluminium ions, and the activation energy is E = E, + E,; at high T,on the contrary, the number of dissociated aluminium ions equals the number of free alkali ions, giving E = 4Ea + E,. This picture leads,however, to a value of the migration energy E, of 0.02 eV, which appeared exceedingly low.
In this paper we report new results in a temperature range extended up to 1500 K;further, results on the AC conductance of irradiated samples in the range
240 K < T <
280 K are shown. The data here reported, and specifically a new high- temperature conduction regime featuring an activation energy of 0.27 eV, suggest a reinterpretation of the ionic transport mechanisms in quartz that considers the local structure of the potential of the interstitial alkali atoms trapped in the neighbourhood of an aluminium impurity [6,7].
2. Experimental conditions
The electrical measurements were performed using a Wayne-Kerr 6425 AC bridge in the frequency range between lo2 and 3 X lo5 Hz and the data were analysed by means of the complex impedance method [SI. For the high-temperature studies the quartz samples were cylinders (diameter of 1 cm; 0.5 cm thick) cut from Sawyer PQ bars; the same experimental apparatus already described elsewhere [5] was used. For the low-T measurements, the crystals were cut to the same diameter but were 0.05 cm thick; the samples were mounted in a capacitor clamped at the cold tail of a metal cryostat equipped with a beryllium window which allowed us to perform the irradiations in situ;these were carried out both at room temperature and at 230 K by an x-ray tube Machlett OEG 50 operating at 38 kV and the total dose was up to lo4 Gy.The surfaces of the samples were both as cut and covered with a nickel deposition.In the two cases the complex impedance diagrams were quite different: at low and intermediate temperatures (up to 1200 K) the samples with nickel-deposited surfaces showed a semicircle due to the bulk contribution that was better defined than that obtained with as-cut samples; at high temperatures ( T > 1200 K), however, the metal deposition was not stable, giving large surface contibutions in the diagrams.In figures 1-3 are reported the complex impedance diagrams for different tem- perature ranges in the case of a sample with as-cut surfaces.In figure l(a) the first semicircle relative to bulk properties is well defined and the value of the resistance of the sample can be easily calculated. By increasing the temperature (figure l(b)) the arc due to the bulk tends to disappear from our range of frequencies but the cusp between the semicircle of the bulk and that due to the contact with electrodes is still evident, allowing us to evaluate the bulk resistance.This situation remains at still higher temperatures where the arc due to electrode effects covers the entire frequency range (figure 2), decreasing its radius with increasing High-T ionic conductivity of quartz

First, you need to sequentially extract any quotes in the literature that are most relevant to each question, and print them in numbered order, separated by newlines. Quotes should be relatively brief. Do not attempt to summarize or answer questions at this stage, but simply repeat exactly what the corresponding part of the literature says.

Please enclose the full list of quotes in <quotes></quotes> XML tags. If there are no relevant quotes, write "No relevant quotes" instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with "Answer:".  Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don't say "According to Quote [1]" when answering. Do not write reference number of quotes after answer. Put your answer to the user inside <EnglishVersionAnswer></EnglishVersionAnswer> XML tags. Output formatted text, with line breaks for each question.Separate quotes and answers with a blank line. Provide the answers to all questions in English. After completing the English answers, translate all those answers into Chinese and provide the Chinese version inside <ChineseVersionAnswer></ChineseVersionAnswer> XML tags.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what's shown between the <example></example> tags.  Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
