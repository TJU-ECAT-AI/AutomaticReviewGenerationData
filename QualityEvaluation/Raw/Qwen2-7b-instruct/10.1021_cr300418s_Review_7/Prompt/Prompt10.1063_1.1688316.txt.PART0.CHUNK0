The atomic and electronic structure of 111!, 110!, and 100! surfaces of ceria (CeO2) were studied using density-functional theory within the generalized gradient approximation. Both stoichiometric surfaces and surfaces with oxygen vacancies unreduced and reduced surfaces, respectively! have been examined. It is found that the 111! surface is the most stable among the considered surfaces,followed by 110! and 100! surfaces, in agreement with experimental observations and previous theoretical results. Different features of relaxation are found for the three surfaces. While the 111! surface undergoes very small relaxation, considerably larger relaxations are found for the 110! and 100! surfaces. The formation of an oxygen vacancy is closely related to the surface structure and occurs more easily for the 110! surface than for 111!. The preferred vacancy location is in the surface layer for CeO2(110) and in the subsurface layer the second O-atomic layer! for CeO2(111).
For both surfaces, the O vacancy forms more readily than in the bulk. An interesting oscillatory behavior is found for the vacancy formation energy in the upper three layers of CeO2(111).
Analysis of the reduced surfaces suggests that the additional charge resulting from the formation of the oxygen vacancies is localized in the first three layers of the surface. Furthermore, they are not only trapped in the 4f states of cerium. 2004 American Institute of Physics.

I. INTRODUCTION
Ceria (CeO2) is of great interest in the modern catalytic industry.1,2 One of the most important applications of CeO2 is its use as a component in automotive three-way catalysts TWCs!,1,3 where NOx , CO, and hydrocarbons HCs! are simultaneously removed. In TWCs, multiple effects have been attributed to CeO2 : namely, 1! promotion of the noble- metal dispersion on the support, 2! increase of the thermal stability of the Al2O3 support, 3! promotion of the water gas shift and steam reforming reactions, and 4! the capacity to store and release oxygen under fuel-lean and fuel-rich conditions, respectively @the so-called oxygen storage capac- ity OSC!#. Some other, less well-confirmed, phenomena or mechanisms are 5! the enhancement of the catalytic activity at interfacial metal-support sites and 6! promotion of CO removal through oxidation via a ceria lattice oxygen.
Among the above-mentioned features, the OSC is par- ticularly interesting. It is closely related to the formation and migration of oxygen vacancies in ceria.2 The bulk properties of ceria have previously been investigated by different theo- retical techniques.47 It has been shown that the ground- state, electronic, and optical properties of stoichiometric bulk CeO2 can be successfully described by standard local density approximation LDA! or generalized gradient approximation GGA! techniques within the density-functional theory
DFT!.57
Gennard et al.8 reported periodic HartreeFock calcula- tions for the 111! and 011! surfaces of c-ZrO2 and CeO2 ,and found the 111! surface to be energetically more stable than the 011! surface. Furthermore, a number of force-field calculations on the stoichiometric surfaces of CeO2 see, for example, Refs. 911! all report the 111! surface to be ener- getically the most stable. Very recently, Skorodumova et al.12 performed DFT investigations of the energetics, surface re- laxation, and electronic structure of 111!, 110!, and 100! surfaces of stoichiometric cerium oxide and found that the sequence of stability of the studied surfaces is (111) .(110).(100).
Experimental observations13 employing x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS! and low-energy electron diffraction LEED! techniques confirm the stability of the 111! surface:such facets are most often found in experiments.
Oxygen vacancy defects can appear on the oxide surface or in the bulk and can strongly modify the electronic and catalytic properties of the oxide see, for example, Refs. 14 and 15 and references therein!. In ceria, the effects of O vacancies have been studied recently by Rodriguez and co-workers.16,17 Several theoretical studies have modeled the state and behavior of anion vacancies in the bulk or at the surface of CeO2 using force-field calculations.10,18 The re- sults from these studies suggest oxygen vacancies to be more stable at the surface than in the bulk18 and vacancies on the 111! surface to be less stable than those on other low-index surfaces: 110! and 211!.10 The first-principles studies of Skorodumova et al.19 of bulk CeO2 and Ce2O3 proposed that a!Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jcp.aip.org/about/rights_and_permissions the oxygen-vacancy formation process in the CeO2 bulk is facilitated by a simultaneous condensation of two electrons into localized f-level traps on two cerium atoms.
The understanding of the formation of oxygen vacancies on ceria surfaces and their modification on the surfaces atomic and electronic structures and chemical properties is still poor. Some of the questions in need of further investi- gation are 1! the preferred location of an oxygen vacancy on different surfaces, 2! the detailed relaxation or reconstruc- tion around the vacancy, 3! vacancyvacancy interactions on the surfaces, and 4! the effects of vacancies on the elec- tronic and chemical properties of the surfaces. In this paper,we present systematic studies of the energetics, surface re- laxation, and electronic structure of the 111!, 110!, and 100! surfaces of stoichiometric cerium dioxide and of the reduced 111! and 110! surfaces using the first-principles all-electron projector-augmented-wave PAW! method based on state-of-the-art DFT theory. The basic structure of the paper is as follows. The computational details are presented in Sec. II. The calculated results and discussion are given in Sec. III and a brief summary in Sec. IV.
II. METHODOLOGY
The KohnSham density-functional theory calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation pack- age VASP!.20 The projector-augmented wave method21 of Blo chl, as implemented in VASP, was used. PAW is an all- electron method that combines the accuracy of augmented- plane-wave methods with the efficiency of the pseudopoten- tial approach. The PAW method is implemented in VASP with the frozen-core approximation. For the plane-wave set, a cut- off energy of 408 eV was used. The cerium 5s, 5p, 5d, 4f,and 6s and the oxygen 2s and 2p electrons were treated as valence electrons. The gradient-corrected exchange and cor- relation functionals of Perdew et al., referred to as PW91,22 are used in the calculations.
The calculated results for bulk CeO2 in Table I show that the above method gives a good description for bulk CeO2 .
Our calculated equilibrium lattice parameter and bulk modu- lus are 5.45 Å and 193.5 GPa, respectively, in agreement with the experimental values of the lattice constant @5.41 Å Ref. 23!# and bulk modulus @236 GPa Ref. 24!, 204 GPa Ref. 25!#. Here some of the earlier theoretical calculations have given 5.48 Å and 187.7 GPa @full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital FP-LMTO! GGA calculations7#, 5.385 Å and 357 GPa HartreeFock periodic calculations4!, and
5.432 Å pseudopotential GGA calculations17!. Our calcu-
lated density of states in Fig. 1 shows clearly that CeO2 is an insulator. The highest occupied valence band exhibits signifi- cant O 2p character mixing with some contribution from Ce 4f5d, while the narrow band situated just above the Fermi level is mainly due to Ce 4f states. The states situated above the empty Ce 4f states are due to 5d and 6s of Ce. The Ce 5s states are located far below the energy window in Fig. 1 at around 233 eV below the Fermi level!. The calculated energy gaps are 1.8 eV between O 2p and Ce 4f states! and
5.7 eV between O 2p and Ce 5d states!, in reasonable
agreement with experimental measurements26 3.0 and 6.0 eV! and previous calculations i.e., Skorodumova et al.,19 2.5 and 5.5 eV; Landrum et al.,6 2.3 eV for the first of these; and Koelling et al.,5 2.8 and 5.5 eV!. The underestimation of the energy gap is a known deficiency of LDA and GGA calcu- lations of this kind.27 The low-index CeO2 surfacesi.e., 111!, 110!, and 100!were modeled as periodically repeated in z! slabs with p(131) lateral cells, as shown in Fig. 2. The x and y dimensions of the unit cell were fixed at the calculated equi- librium lattice parameter value (a55.45 Å). A vacuum layer of 10 Å was introduced on the top of the free surface to separate the films. The 111! surface was terminated by oxy- gen. As shown in Fig. 2, the 111! surface was modeled as a stack of OCeO! sandwiches; this prevents the appearance of a nonzero dipole moment normal to the surface. A 21- layer-thick slab was used for 111!. The recent first- principles calculations in Ref. 12 suggest that even a 9-layer thick slab may be a reasonable approximation for the 111!

The 110! surface was modeled as a stack of 9 identical planes fulfilling the CeO2 stoichiometry with zero perpendicular dipole moment. The polar 100! surface was modeled as an oxygen-terminated surface with half of the surface oxygen atoms moved from one surface of the film to the other in a checkerboard style to fulfill the CeO2 formula and to avoid a dipole moment normal to the surface. The resulting structure can then be described as 15 alternating oxygen and cerium layers in a OCeOOCeO se- quence. The checkerboard model for 100! has been used previously in theoretical studies see, for example, Refs. 1012!.
The Brillouin-zone integrations were performed using MonkhorstPack MP! grids28 and a Gaussian smearing29 of
SIGMA50.2 eV. The final results are extrapolated to that of
SIGMA50 eV. MP grids of (1031031), (831031), and (1031031) were used for the 111!, 110!, and 100! sur- faces, respectively. A MP grid of (10310310) was used in the bulk calculation. The slabs were allowed to fully relax in all directions under the restriction of fixed cell parameters.
O-deficient or reduced 111! and 110! surfaces were studied using slabs consisting of 12 and 5 atomic layers,respectively, with p()31) and p(132) lateral cells as shown in Fig. 3. A vacuum layer of 15 Å thickness was introduced to separate the films. The bottom 6 @for the 111! surface# or 2 @for the 110! surface# atomic layers were fixed at their bulk positions to mimic the bulk and the remaining layers were allowed to relax. One of the surface O atoms was removed to model the formation of an
O
vacancy.
O-deficient surfaces with larger lateral cellsi.e., p() 32) for 111! and p(232) for 110!were also studied as a check of the vacancyvacancy interaction effects.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Stoichiometric cerium oxide surface:
Surface energies and relaxation As a measure of surface stability, the surface energies were evaluated by Esurf5 1 2S Eslab2Ebulk!,1! where Eslab is the total energy of the slab, Ebulk is the energy of the bulk unit cell containing the same number of atoms as in the slab, and S is the surface area. The lower the surface energy, the more stable the surface. If we take Eslab as the total energy of the unrelaxed slab, we will get the surface energy for the unrelaxed surface, which we denote Esurf unrelax.
Conversely, if we take Eslab as the total energy of the relaxed slab, we will have a relaxed surface energy denoted by Esurf relax cf. Ref. 19!. The difference between these two surface en- ergies can serve as a measure of the size of the relaxation.
Without access to experimental data for the surface energies of ceria, we compare our calculated surface energies with results from previous theoretical calculations.8,1012 In brief,the relative stability trends of our present study agree with the previous studies; i.e., the stability decreases in the order (111).(110).(100), and the degree of structural relaxation increases in the order (111),(110),(100).
Our current GGA calculations @using PAW potentials,the optimized bulk unit cell parameter, and slab thicknesses of 21, 9, and 15 atomic layers for 111!, 110!, and 100!,respectively# gave the following results. The 111! surface

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jcp.aip.org/about/rights_and_permissions has the smallest surface energy among the low-index sur- faces studied, 0.60 J/m2. The surface energy changes very little upon relaxation, by just 0.01 J/m2, and the relaxation occurring on this surface is small. These results are con- nected to the fact that 111! is the most compact of the three surfaces, with all the exposed Ce ions being seven coordi- nated and all the surface O ions three coordinated; as a result,the coordination of the surface atoms is only slightly per- turbed when the surface is cleaved. The 110! surface is next in stability, with a surface energy of 1.01 J/m2 for the relaxed surface and a relaxation energy of 0.18 J/m2. The 100! sur- face has the highest surface energy, 1.43 J/m2 for the relaxed surface, and the largest relaxation energy of 0.55 J/m2. Our results are very close to the recent GGA-PAW results of Sko- rodumova et al.12 The small differences between the surface energies in these two studies might possibly arise from the different slab thicknesses, the somewhat higher energy cutoff 500 eV! used in Ref. 12, and the fact that the atomic posi- tions have been relaxed in all three directions in the present study.
To study the atomic structure of the relaxed surfaces, we also calculated the differences between the consecutive inter- planar distances in the relaxed slabs and those in bulk ceria for 111!, 110!, and 100!, respectively, as presented in Ref.
12. The three low-index faces display different relaxation
properties. The 111! surface relaxation is found to be quite small, with the Ce sublattice staying rather intact, while the O sublattice undergoes larger changes in the interlayer dis- tances ca. 0.03 Å!. The displacements show a slight contrac- tion of the first few layers for the 111! surface. The relax- ation at the 110! surface exhibits an opposite behavior compared to that of 111!. The cerium sublattice undergoes larger changes the change in the interplanar distances is ca.
60.23 Å! than the oxygen sublattice, which stays almost
unaffected. The flat ideal 110! surface becomes slightly rumpled upon relaxation, with Ce atoms displaced towards the center of the slab by 0.13 Å relative to the surface O atoms; this equals 2.4% of the ceria bulk lattice constant.
Our relaxed structures for the 111! and 110! surfaces are in very good agreement with the GGA results of Ref. 12, where the maximum changes in interlayer distance compared to bulk were found to occur in the O sublattice for 111! and in the cerium sublattice for 110!; the maximum changes were
0.03 and 0.25 Å, respectively, for the two surfaces. The
atomic positions were allowed to relax in all three directions in the present study, and for the 110! surface, the surface oxygen atoms are found to move laterally by 0.07 Å toward the surface Ce atoms, while at the subsurface layer the oxy- gen lateral movements also toward Ce! are much smaller ca. 0.008 Å!. As a result, the CeO bond length at the surface shrinks by 0.03 Å compared to the bond length in the bulk. A similar lateral relaxation was found from the molecu- lar dynamics simulation, but as mentioned, was not allowed in the previous DFT calculations.12 The relaxation on the 100! surface is more complex because of the removal of half a monolayer of outer-layer oxygen atoms. A detailed structure of the relaxed 100! sur- face was not given in previous studies. Our calculated results show that the interlayer distances in the Ce sublattice in- crease slightly expanded ca. 0.05 Å near the surface!. The coplanar O atoms are split into two sets. One set experiences a small contraction in the interlayer distances ca. 0.1 Å!; the other experiences an interlayer expansion of about 0.17 Å near the surface.
The larger relaxations on the 110! and 100! surfaces compared to 111! are consistent with the larger relaxation energies for these surfaces. At the centers of the slabs, the structures are quite bulk like, especially for 111! and 110!,which confirms that the slab thicknesses chosen are reason- able. For all three surfaces, the relaxations occur mainly within the few outermost slab layers.
B. Stoichiometric cerium oxide surface:
Electronic structure In order to study the electronic structure at the three surfaces, layer-projected densities of states LPDOS! were calculated in successive layers, going from the surfaces to- wards the slab centers. For 110! the LPDOS was calculated layer by layer, while for the other two surfaces, the LPDOS was calculated over two or three neighboring layers to fulfill the stoichiometry. The results are shown in Figs. 46 and compared to the bulk DOS dotted line!. Some interesting features can be observed in the three figures: 1! only the DOS for the outermost layers differs significantly from that of bulk CeO2 , and the DOS for the central layer is quite bulk like in all cases; 2! the surface O 2p band is narrower than that of bulk CeO2 and the band gap between O 2p and Ce 4f becomes smaller on the surface compared to the bulk. On the other hand, different surfaces also display different features.
For the 110! surface, new features appear in the gap be- tween the Ce 4f and Ce 5d states. These new features are

For the 111! and 100! surfaces, these features do not exist, which is due to the differing nature of the termination of the surface. More specifically, the 111! and 100! surfaces are terminated by a pure oxygen layer, while the 110! surface is terminated by a mixed CeO layer, resulting in the surface Ce atoms pos- sessing two dangling bonds directed out of the surface.
C. Reduced cerium oxide surfaces
1. Formation energies and surface structures
The formation and migration of the oxygen vacancies in ceria is closely related to the oxygen storage capacity of ceria in TWC, as mentioned in the Introduction. Here a systematic study of the formation of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces is presented. Different locations of the va- cancy near the surfaces are considered. Our results for the unreduced surfaces showed that the surface relaxations for the 111! and 110! surfaces are quite small and confined within a few top layers. Also, the small! deviations of the electronic density of states at the surface compared to the bulk occur only in the top few layers. Thus our approach of using a thin slab with the bottom layers fixed to mimic the bulk! appears to be reasonable see Methodology section for more details!. Figure 3 shows the reduced 111! and 110! surface models, which are described in some detail in the Methodology section.
The formation energy (En) of an O vacancy can be cal- culated by En5ECeO2n!1 1 2 EO2!2ECeO2!,2! where E(CeO2n) and E(CeO2) are the total energies of the CeO2 films with and without an O vacancy on the surface,and E(O2) is the total energy for the ground state of an oxygen molecule in the gas phase. In this standard definition of the vacancy formation energy, the oxygen atom that is liberated during the process is assumed to form molecular oxygen, which has a calculated bonding energy of 6.033 eV.
The calculated values of En for the 111! and 110! surfaces,as well as the distance (dvac) between a vacancy and its nearest-neighbor image, are listed in Table II. A positive value for En means that energy is needed to create an O vacancy. The lower the value, the easier it is to create a vacancy.
On the CeO2(111) p()31) surface, the formation en- ergy of an O vacancy on the topmost O-atomic layer first layer! is 3.98 eV, which is close to the cost of creating an O vacancy in the third O-atomic layer, 3.96 eV. Interestingly,our calculations show that it is easier to create an O vacancy in the second O-atomic layer (En53.8 eV). Since one might expect an inner surface vacancy to be less accessible than a topmost surface vacancy, this may have consequences on the reactivity of the reduced 111! surfaces. Previous studies10 have only examined the O-vacancy formation energies from the topmost oxygen layer. Our results here show an oscilla- tory behavior of En versus the vacancy location with respect to the surface. The values shown in the parentheses in the (111)p()31) column in Table II are the formation ener- gies in the corresponding layer at the ideal bulk-terminated 111! surface. The effects of relaxation are seen to be quite

Redistribution subject to AIP license or copyright; see http://jcp.aip.org/about/rights_and_permissions large, between 1.07 and 1.25 eV for the different layers, but the preferred location for the O vacancy is the samei.e., in the second O-atomic layer.
For the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, we obtain a lower En value in the surface layer than in the subsurface layer,
3.17 and 3.66 eV, respectively. By comparing the formation
energies of an O vacancy on the 111! and 110! surfaces, it can be concluded that formation of an O vacancy seems more difficult on the CeO2(111) surface than on CeO2(110).
This is in agreement with earlier shell-model calculations and has been attributed to the more compact and stable na- ture of the 111! surface.10,18 Our results suggest that the preferred vacancy location is closely related to the oxide sur- face orientation; this is highly relevant in the context of ceria-enhanced catalytic reactions.
For comparison, the formation energy of an O vacancy within the bulk was studied using a cubic 12-atom unit cell (Ce4O8) with one of the O atoms removed. The resulting formation energy was 4.73 eV, which is close to the FP- LMTO DFT results of Skorodumova et al.19 4.55 eV for a 96-atom cubic cell!. Our surface En values in Table II are all lower than our bulk value. This is in agreement with earlier empirical interaction model calculations,10 which suggested that a vacancy defect is more stable at the surface than within the bulk.
The vacancyvacancy interaction between defect images in different cells was studied using slabs with larger lateral cells: namely, p()32) for 111! and p(232) for 110!.
As in the smaller systems, a single O vacancy was created at different depths from the surface. A larger lateral cell allows the study of a lower vacancy density with larger vacancy vacancy distances. The calculated formation energies are presented in Table II. It is found that, for both surfaces, the formation energy of an O vacancy is reduced by 0.60.7 eV when the larger cell is used. The preferred vacancy locations,however, are the same for the bigger cellsi.e., the second O-atomic layer for 111! and the top layer for 110!. There are probably several reasons for the reduction in En as the vacancy density decreases: i! different relaxation patterns depending on the vacancy density and ii! charge redistribu- tion around the vacancies cause a Coulomb repulsion be- tween O vacanciesthe larger the vacancy separation, the weaker the repulsion.
The relaxed structures for the reduced surfaces are shown in Figs. 3c! and 3d!. On the reduced surfaces, sig- nificant reconstruction occurs around the vacancy, which is labeled V in Figs. 3c! and 3d!. For the CeO2(111) p()31) surface with an O vacancy in the second O-atomic layer @Fig. 3c!#, we find that i! the Ce ions move away from the vacancy center and as a result the CeCe distance be- tween the surface Ce atoms increases by 0.25 Å; ii! the O ions move toward the vacancy center, the most pronounced movement involving the O ion located in the topmost layer just above the vacancy; this ion moves downward by 0.13 Å;and iii! the CeO bond lengths around the vacancy shrink by ;0.14 Å. Similar structural deformations were found around the vacancy on the CeO2(110) p(132) surface @Fig. 3d!#: namely, i! the Ce ions move away from the vacancy center leading to a CeCe distance increase by 0.3 Å for the surface Ce atoms neighboring the vacancy and ii! the OCe bond length of the bridge O shrinks by 0.17 Å. Additionally,there is a more pronounced deformation occurring for CeO2(110)namely, that one of the surface CeO bonds close to the vacancy breaks and the O atom assumes a bridg- ing coordination from three to two coordinated!. This fea- ture is circled in Fig. 3d!. These defective surfaces with significant changes in surface structure are expected to be more active towards foreign incoming atoms and molecules than the clean perfect surfaces. To the best of our knowledge,the structural changes on the reduced CeO2 surfaces reported here are the first such reports in the literature based on first- principles DFT calculations.

The total DOS of the unreduced and reduced surfaces for CeO2(111) p()31) and CeO2(110) p(132) are shown in Figs. 7 and 8, respectively. The most pronounced differences between the density of states of the reduced and unreduced surfaces are that in the reduced surfaces the Ce 4f states the high peak in the gap! become partially filled and some new states gap states! appear in the gap between the Ce 4f and Ce 5d peaks. These partially filled states and the empty gap states should make the reduced surfaces more reactive as compared with the unreduced surfaces. Indeed, very different features for the interaction of SO2 and NO2 with pure unre- duced! and reduced CeO2 were detected recently by photo- emission studies.16,17 Conceptually, when the reduced surface is formed from the unreduced surface, a neutral oxygen atom is removed,thereby leaving two electrons behind. A natural question that arises when discussing the electronic structure of the reduced surface is how the additional electrons are distributed.

Table III gives the differences in the total and partial atomic charges between the reduced and unreduced CeO2(110) p(132) model surfaces. A positive value indi- cates that the reduced surface has gained electron density compared to the unreduced surface. Although atomic charges cannot be unambiguously defined, the results presented are derived by integrating the total and partial electron densities around an atom within a nonoverlapping cutoff radius (rc
50.9 Å for O and rc51.32 Å for Ce!. The net total charge
gained within the specified atomic spheres is 0.8 electrons,with the remainder in the interstitial regions. The results in- dicate that of the 0.8 electrons gained, almost half (0.38e) are localized to the three Ce atoms adjacent to the oxygen vacancy. These are the atoms identified with asterisks in Table III. Most of the remainder (0.32e) is spread amongst oxygen atoms in the first and third layers.
We note that based on the TDOS of the reduced surfaces one may conclude that the additional electrons fill the Ce 4f states since the most pronounced difference between the re- duced and unreduced TDOS is the penetration of the Fermi level into the upper part of the Ce 4f band for the reduced surface. For the CeO2(110) p(132), the number of elec- trons in the narrow, partially filled Ce 4f peak can be esti- mated to 1.9e, by integration from the bottom of this peak at ca. 20.4 eV! up to the Fermi level. Thus one might conclude that the additional two electrons are all localized to the Ce atoms. However, this is not in agreement with the atomic charge data presented in Table III, which suggest that the additional charge is shared between the surface Ce and O atoms. Much of the 1.9e gained in the narrow Ce 4f peak comes from the low-energy part of the Ce 4f states in the region from 23 to 21 eV! which overlap with the O 2p states cf. Fig. 1!. Integrating the low-energy part of the Ce 4f states of both the reduced and unreduced surfaces and taking the difference reveals that the lower part of the Ce 4f states diminishes by approximately 1.5 electrons upon reduc- tion. This is caused by the 4f states on Ce atoms adjacent to the vacancy becoming more nonbonding in nature as the oxygen atom is removed. To study this further, the partial density of states of a Ce atom adjacent to the vacancy, as well as of a subsurface Ce atom, is plotted in Fig. 9. Figure 9 reveals that for the Ce atom adjacent to the O vacancy, the lower 4f band is diminished for the reduced surface as com- pared to the unreduced surface. For a Ce atom in the subsur- face layer second nearest neighbor of the vacancy!, the lower 4f band is less noticeably diminished.
Thus we find that only a modest fraction of the two electrons released at the surface upon reduction populates the Ce 4f levels. Table III also lists the atomic charges broken up into s, p, d, and f contributions. This shows that upon reduction of the CeO2(110) p(132) surface, there is a net gain of 0.36e in the Ce 4f states that is distributed mainly on Ce atoms within the top three layers of the model surface. As mentioned above, most of the remaining electrons are do- nated to oxygen atoms. Therefore, for CeO2 , the extra elec- trons left by the creation of O vacancies are not completely localized at the vacancy site. The behavior is similar to that found on surfaces of other oxides e.g., TiO2 and SrTiO3) that are also not highly ionic,30 but very different from that seen for a highly ionic oxide like MgO where the extra elec- trons are actually localized on the vacancy site.15,31 For the reduced CeO2(110) p(132), we have also per- formed spin-polarized calculations. The spin-polarized sys- tem is slightly preferred energetically by 0.02 eV/cell. The spin polarization is small and is localized rather evenly on the Ce atoms of the top three layers. Small parallel ordering magnetic moments of ;0.2mB appear on these atoms. There is no structural change and nor is there any significant charge redistribution, as compared to the non-spin-polarized case.
Similar results are found for the reduced CeO2(111) p()31) surface. The reduced CeO2(111) p()31) sur-

Approximately half of this gain is localized to the Ce atoms closest to the vacancy, with the majority of the re- mainder spread about the O atoms in the first two layers of the surface. Again, the spin-polarized surface is slightly pre- ferred, with a small magnetization energy ;20.025 eV!.
There are no structural changes; nor is there any significant redistribution of the total charge as compared with the non- spin-polarized case. Spin polarization is localized to the Ce atoms within the top two layers, but in an antiparallel order- ing of the spin moments of approximately 0.3mB and
20.4mB per atom in the topmost layer.
The first-principles studies of Skorodumova et al.7,19 of bulk CeO2 and Ce2O3 proposed that 1! the Ce 4f states in Ce2O3 should be treated within the core-state model CSM!i.e., as part of the core statesand the Ce 4f states in CeO2 should be treated as valence-band-like model states VBM! and 2! that the oxygen-vacancy formation process in the CeO2 bulk is facilitated by a simultaneous condensation of two electrons into localized f-level traps on two cerium atoms. Compared with their bulk Ce2O3 and their reduced bulk model removing 25% of the oxygen atoms!, our defec- tive surfaces are only slightly reduced. We have treated the Ce 4f state as valence states as in their VBM approach. Our results for the charge distribution on the reduced surfaces show that part of the excess electrons left by the removal of the O atoms will fill the Ce 4f states in the gap, which are empty in the stoichiometric case. These electrons are rather evenly distributed not just localized on two Ce atoms! on the Ce atom close to the vacancy within a few top layers.
It was argued that Ce 4f states close to the vacancy on the reduced surface should be treated as core states using the
CSM.7,19 Test calculations of ours where the 4f states for
two of the Ce atoms close to the vacancy were treated by the CSM showed that the CSM is energetically unfavorable with total energies 4.20 and 3.70 eV for CeO2(110) p(132) and CeO2(111) p()31), respectivelyi.e., higher than when the VBM model was used for all the 4f states of Ce atoms.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
The atomic and electronic structure of stoichiometric and O-deficient 111!, 110!, and 100! surfaces of ceria were studied using projector-augmented-wave method based on density-functional theory within generalized gradient ap- proximation. According to the surface energies, it is found that the 111! surface is the most stable among the consid- ered surfaces, followed by the 110! and 100! surfaces, in agreement with experimental observations and previous the- oretical results.

For the reduced surfaces, the Ce 4f states are partially occupied.
The conductivity and chemical properties are expected to be modified by the creation of O vacancies.
