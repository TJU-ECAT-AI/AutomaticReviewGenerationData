1. Introduction
Ceria is a widely used metal oxide in catalytic applications, well known examples include CO oxidation and NOx reduction [1,2].
This utility arises from the relative ease with which Ce4+ can be reduced to Ce3+ through, e.g., oxygen vacancy formation [3,4].
The loss of oxygen facilitates CO oxidation [57], while the reduced Ce3+ remaining at the surface are active sites for adsorption of NOx [8], and the ultimate reduction to N2.
There has been a great deal of interest in doping ceria to en- hance its reactivity, with a particular focus on CO oxidation [2,6,9,10]. Substitutional cation doping of ceria with another spe- cies, such as Zr [1012], Ti [10], Au [6] and Cu [13], has been shown to reduce the energy required for formation of oxygen vacancies.
However, less attention has been given to NOx reduction. It is known that in order for NO2 to react with ceria, Ce3+ sites must be present [14] and earlier modelling work has studied the adsorp- tion of NO2 at reduced ceria surfaces [8,15]. We are interested in systems in which Ce3+ can be produced by doping, as an alternative to oxygen vacancy formation. To this end, we present a first prin- ciples study of the Ta and Nb doped CeO2 (1 1 0) surface. Work from Ramirez-Cabrera et al. [16] indicates formation of Ce3+ upon doping of CeO2 with Nb and therefore for Nb/Ta-doped CeO2, we expect that one Ce3+ ion will be formed. For comparison, a number of publications have shown that doping of TiO2 with Ta and Nb produces a single reduced Ti3+ cation [17].
Given the problems with using density functional theory (DFT) to study ceria, we apply two DFT approaches: DFT corrected for on- site Coulomb interactions, DFT + U [18] and hybrid DFT, in the shape of the HSE06 functional [19]. While the DFT + U approach has been successfully used to describe undoped and doped ceria and its reactivity, as evidenced in a number of publications [35,710,12,2024], it suffers from the need for a choice of U parameter. Hybrid DFT has been used to describe successfully the oxygen vacancy in the (1 1 1) ceria surface [25], but is a very expensive approach for studies of systems with a large number of atoms, placing a limit on the type of systems that can be studied.
Our approach is the following: we use DFT + U (U = 5 eV [3]) and HSE06 to study the Ta and Nb doped (1 1 0) surface and show that DFT + U provides a consistent description of the resulting Ce3+ de- fect, with one Ce3+ ion being formed. The choice of U in the present Letter is sufficient to describe localised Ce3+ and is used through- out. We then use DFT + U to study NO2 adsorption at the doped surface and show that at the undoped surface, NO2 does not react,but NO2 reacts with the Ce3+ present at the doped surface, showing that Ce3+ species are needed to activate NO2.
2. Methods
We use slab models of the (1 1 0) surface and a plane wave basis set to describe the valence electronic wave functions with the VASP code [26]. The cut-off for the kinetic energy is 396 eV. For the core valence interaction we apply Blchls projector augmented wave (PAW) approach [27]. For Ce, we use 12 valence electrons, for Nb 11 valence electrons, Ta five valence electrons and for O and N six and five valence electrons, respectively. We use the Perdew BurkeErnzerhof (PBE) approximation for the exchangecorrelation functional [28]. In common with earlier studies [710,12,2024],we use density functional theory (DFT) corrected for on-site Cou- lomb interactions (DFT + U), where U = 5 eV and is applied to the Ce 4f states in oxidised and reduced ceria, both undoped and doped.
The details of this approach and our choice of U are discussed exten- sively in [3,4]. The choice of U is an important question. Our choice of U = 5 eV was motivated by consistently describing the Ce3+ derived state found upon oxygen vacancy formation in reduced ceria [3], where this value resulted in a localised defect state and 0009-2614/$ - see front matter  2010 Elsevier B.V.

In a recent publication Huang and Fabris [7] have determined that in order to best match the experimentally determined adsorption energy of CO on ceria U must be set to 2 eV.
However, we and others [24], have found that U = 2 eV does not describe the electronic structure of Ce3+ correctly. This means that while the energy of CO adsorption at ceria might be consistent with experiment, the nature of the reduced Ce3+ species will not be consistently described. In earlier work on doping the CeO2 (1 1 0) surface with Ti, Zr and Hf [10], we instead focussed on assessing trends in adsorption energies on going from the undoped to the doped surface and this strategy has also been discussed in Ref.
[24] and is used in the present Letter. To provide a benchmark for the DFT + U description of the Ta and Nb doped surface, we also apply the hybrid HSE06 functional, which has been used for oxygen vacancies in the (1 1 1) surface [25].
The (1 1 0) surface is type I (in the Tasker classification) with each plane made up of stoichiometric CeO2 layers and no dipole moment is present upon cleaving. We use a (2  2) expansion of the (1 1 0) surface supercell [10], giving a dopant concentration of
3.6% and from Ref. [3] the slab thickness is seven layers (11.5 Å),
with a 15 Å vacuum gap. The bottom two layers were fixed during the relaxations. All calculations are spin polarised. k-point sampling is performed using the MonkhorstPack scheme, with a (2  2  1) sampling grid, suitable for this surface expansion [3].
The adsorption energy of NO2 is given by Eads  EM0:036Ce1:964O2  NO2  EM0:036Ce1:964O2  ENO2 1 In Eq. (1), the dopant concentrations are given in the subscripts on Ce and M (M = Ta, Nb). For undoped ceria the concentration of M is zero. Throughout, a negative energy signifies that formation of adsorbed NO2 is favourable.
3. Results
3.1. The doped (1 1 0) surface
In Fig. 1 we show the structure of the (1 1 0) ceria surface doped with Ta (Fig. 1a) and Nb (Fig. 1b) from the HSE06 calculations (the DFT + U picture is little changed and is shown in the Supporting information). It is immediately apparent that doping with Ta intro- duces substantial distortions to the local atomic structure around the dopant, while distortions with Nb doping are less strong.
In the undoped (1 1 0) surface, surface Ce ions are coordinated to four oxygen atoms in the surface layer and two oxygen atoms in the next subsurface layer, with CeO distances of 2.33 Å. With Ta doping, there are now three shorter surface TaO distances in both DFT + U and HSE06, as shown in Table 1 and a very long TaO distance of 3.53 Å, so that Ta only coordinates to three sur- face Ce ions. Also, one surface oxygen atom is pushed out of the surface plane by 0.80 Å. TaO distances to the two subsurface oxy- gen ions are 1.98 Å. In terms of Ce, there are changes in the envi- ronment of Ce nearest the dopant, with a short surface CeO distance of 1.94 Å and two other CeO distances 2.25 and 2.39 Å.
The fourth surface oxygen is the oxygen that now protrudes from the surface, and is no longer coordinated to Ce.
With Nb doping, the distortions around the dopant are less strong resulting in more uniform NbO distances when compared to Ta doping, although the dopant sinks towards the bulk, by
0.36 Å. The four surface NbO distances are found in two pairs with
both DFT approaches, all of which are shorter than in the undoped surface, Table 1. The Ce ion nearest the dopant shows four elon- gated CeO distances, in the range 2.502.72 Å, consistent with the short dopantO distances in the surface.
Thus DFT + U and HSE06 give similar structural changes upon doping of the ceria surface with Ta and Nb.
Since the dopants have a formal +5 oxidation state, the ionic picture says that four of the electrons will be donated to oxygen,with one electron left to be accommodated. In fact, this question is similar to the case of Ta and Nb doped TiO2, in which DFT + U cal- culations show formation of a localised Ti3+ [17]. To see the desti- nation of the extra electron, we plot in Fig. 2 the spin density of that electron for both dopants from HSE06, with the DFT + U re- sults being similar. The spin density for the surface with both do- pants shows that the extra electron is transferred to one surface Ce ion, which is consequently reduced from Ce4+ to Ce3+. The spin density isosurface is characteristic of a 4f orbital, consistent with earlier studies and irrespective of the DFT method used. This Ce ion shows the elongated CeO distances discussed above, e.g., for Nb, consistent with it being in a reduced state.
The dopants give different lattice sites for the Ce3+ ion and we attribute this to the different structural distortions that occur for each dopant  e.g., the Ce ion nearest the Ta is unable to accommo- date the extra electron in its distorted environment. Recent work has shown for the (1 1 1) surface that the site at which Ce3+ ions are found is influenced by the distortions to the structure that oc- cur, as discussed in recent work [25,29].
Fig. 2 shows the total electronic density of states (EDOS) for the (1 1 0) surface with both dopants from DFT + U and HSE06. Both methods result in formation of a Ce 4f state in the previous energy gap between the top of the valence band and the unoccupied Ce 4f states. However, there are differences in the positions of the Ce 4f state between the dopants and between the DFT approaches. For Nb, DFT + U places the Ce 4f state very close to the top of the VB,while HSE06 positions this state 1.5 eV above the valence band edge. For Ta doping, the offset from the valence band edge to the gap state is 1.5 eV with DFT + U and 2.2 eV with HSE06. Thus, DFT + U and HSE06 predict formation of the Ce 4f gap state, that this state is closer to the VB for Nb doping. The band gap underes- timation present in DFT + U does impact on the precise position of the Ce 4f states in the band gap.
3.2. Adsorption of NO2 at the doped (1 1 0) surface
The formation of Ce3+ upon doping provides a reactive site for adsorption of NO2, which is a key step in the reduction of NO2 to Fig. 1.

N2. We have already shown using DFT + U (U = 5 eV on Ce, as in the
present Letter) [8] that NO2 adsorbs strongly at undoped ceria sur- faces in which Ce3+ was formed by generating oxygen vacancies.
One of these Ce3+ is reoxidised to Ce4+ and NO2 is partially reduced to an NO2 anion. Experimental work indicates that NO2 will not adsorb at the stoichiometric ceria (1 1 1) surface [14], but there are no available experimental data for the energetics of adsorption at undoped or doped surfaces (whether with or without oxygen vacancies). With DFT + U giving a consistent description of the for- mation of Ce3+ from Ta and Nb doping, we have carried out a DFT + U calculation of NO2 adsorption at the defect-free, undoped (1 1 0) surface and find no interaction between the molecule and the oxide.
We initially adsorb NO2 at the (1 1 0) surface with Ta and Nb do- pants and position one oxygen atom over the surface Ce3+ ion and relax using DFT + U. In Ref. [8] one oxygen atom of NO2 interacts Table 1 DopantO distances in Ta and Nb doped CeO2 (1 1 0) surface, from DFT + U and HSE06.

117 with surface Ce3+, so this is a reasonable starting point. We have tried different adsorption configurations and those presented in this Letter were the most stable. The final adsorption structures are shown in Fig. 3. The adsorption energies show a gain of
0.87 eV (Ta) and 0.73 eV (Nb), indicating favourable adsorption
of NO2 and a reasonably strong interaction.
On the doped surfaces, one oxygen from NO2 (denoted OS) coor- dinates to the surface Ce3+ ion, with CeOS distances of 2.23 Å (Ta) and 2.21 Å (Nb). The NOS distances are 1.37 Å (Ta) and 1.38 Å (Nb), while the NO distance to the other oxygen of NO2 (denoted ON) is 1.21 Å at both surfaces. For comparison, at the undoped (1 1 0) surface [8], we found an NOS distance of 1.31 Å and an NON distance of 1.25 Å. Thus at Ta and Nb doped surfaces, NO2 is activated by interaction with the Ce3+ ion, resulting in an elonga- tion of the NOS distance, with the NON distance consistent with the NO distance in free NO. This means that the NO2 molecule is dissociating to oxygen and NO (which undergoes further reduction to N2).
An analysis of the electronic structure shows that the Ce 4f elec- tron initially in the Ce3+ species is transferred to the NO2 molecule,which is now an NO2 anion. This mechanism of Ce3+-to-adsor- bate charge transfer is the same as that which was elucidated for NO2 adsorption at the undoped surface with oxygen vacancies [8]. Thus the vital factor in the reduction of NO2 is the presence of Ce3+ ions at the oxide surface and the ease with which such ions can be reoxidised through charge transfer to an adsorbate. Doping of ceria with high oxidation state cations is a novel and potentially more controlled means of generating Ce3+ ions that are active for molecular reduction, as compared to oxygen vacancy formation.
4. Summary
It is usual to think of Ce3+ ions in ceria as being formed by oxy- gen vacancies. We compare two density functional theory ap- proaches,
DFT + U
and hybrid
HSE06,
to demonstrate that localised Ce3+ ions are produced by substitutional doping of CeO2 with +5 cations, Ta and Nb. This strategy should be a more con- trolled means of introducing Ce3+ ions, with one such ion formed for each +5 dopant. We also show that at these doped surfaces,the presence of the Ce3+ ions is key to activating NO2, by charge transfer from Ce3+ to the molecule, which weakens one NO bond and is the first step in dissociation to NO and oxygen.
