PalaHoria Metiu View Author Information View Author Information Open PDF Abstract We use oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE) as a measure of how easily lattice oxygen may participate in the Mars and Van Krevelen mechanism for oxidation reactions. We calculate with density functional theory how OVFE is affected when some of Zn atoms in ZnO(1010) surface layer are substituted by other metal dopants. We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to be located at the surface of ZnO rather than in the bulk. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase OVFE. Most of the dopants that increase OVFE prefer to substitute Zn atoms in the bulk, except for Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb, which prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface. These calculations lead us to conclude that doping an oxide is an efficient method of modifying its oxidative power.

1. Introduction
A large fraction of the output of the chemical industry consists of products obtained by oxidation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions catalyzed by oxides. 1-6 In most cases, the reaction proceeds through a Marsvan Krevelen mechanism. 7,8 The species to be oxidized reacts with the oxygen atoms at the surface of the oxide, creating oxygen vacancies. The reduced oxide is oxidized by reacting with gas-phase oxygen. Since the first step in this mechanism is a reaction with the atoms at the surface of the oxide, it is reasonable to assume that a treatment that activates surface oxygen may help produce oxidation catalysts that work at lower temperature or have higher reactivity than the untreated oxide.One such treatment 9-34 substitutes some of the cations in the surface of an oxide MmOn with a different cation D, to form a single-phase compound having the chemical formula DxMm-xOn and x < 0.2. In what follows, we call D a dopant, MmOn the host oxide, and DxMm-xOn a doped oxide. We emphasize that our use of the term doping has nothing to do with doping semiconductors to change their electrical conductivity or magnetic properties.We believe that the formation of the OMODO groups at the surface of a doped oxide, may cause the oxygen atom in between M and D to be more reactive than the oxygen atoms in the pure oxide MmOn. In addition, the dopant D may also become more active than it would be in the surface of its own oxide, or as a neutral metal atom supported on the oxide MmOn.The experimental study of catalysis by doped oxides is difficult for several reasons. In principle, the methods of preparation can form doped oxides. Unfortunately, they may also form one of several alternatives: a fine physical mixture of two oxides, small oxide clusters of D supported on the oxide MmOn, very small neutral clusters of the metal D supported on the oxide MmOn, or a doped oxide in which all dopant atoms are hidden in the bulk of the material. In addition, it has not been shown conclusively that the doped oxide is not modified during catalysis to form one of the alternatives enumerated in the previous sentence, which may then be the real catalyst. Because of these uncertainties, it is not an established fact that doped oxides provide us with an interesting class of catalysts for oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation. However, our reading of the experimental literature has convinced us that there is enough circumstantial evidence to make the study of this class of possible catalysts worthwhile. Because of this, we have recently used density functional theory (DFT) to study CO oxidation by TiO2(110) and CeO2(111) surfaces doped with Au. In the case of AuxTi1-xO2, we found that the presence of Au causes an oxygen atom at the surface to react readily with CO to make CO2, which desorbs easily leaving behind an oxygen vacancy.10 Gas-phase oxygen adsorbs at the vacancy site, and this weakens the OO bond and causes the adsorbed oxygen to react with CO and make a carbonate. This decomposes easily to release CO2 and heal the oxygen vacancy. This sequence of reactions is catalytic because the reduced oxide is reoxidized. A similar mechanism was found for AuxCe1-xO2 except that the CO reacts with two of the oxygen atoms at the surface to form a carbonate, which decomposes releasing CO2 and forming a vacancy at the surface. 35 The mechanism by which the vacancy is healed is similar to that of AuxTi1-xO2. It is quite possible that other reactions on other doped oxides will have a more complex mechanism.Because these calculations are very tedious, we have used the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase as a criterion for judging the oxidative power of a doped oxide. We examined the effect of doping TiO2(110) with Au, Cu, Ag, Pt, Pd, and Ni and found that all of these dopants lower substantially the energy needed for forming an oxygen vacancy. We take this to mean that one of the oxygen atoms near the dopant is much more reactive than the oxygen atoms of the pure oxide. This suggests that the doped oxides will perform oxidation reactions at lower temperatures than the undoped ones. The same is true for Ag, Cu, and Au dopants at the surface of CeO2(111). In all these cases, the dopant prefers to be located at the surface of the host oxide rather than in the bulk.So far, it has been difficult to find any qualitative factor that will allow us to guess a priori the effect of the dopant. This is so because of the many factors involved in determining the magnitude of oxygen vacancy formation energy (OVFE). For most dopants tried in our previous calculations (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd, Ni), the formal charge of the dopant is lower than the formal charge of the atoms they substitute in the host oxide (TiO2 or CeO2). The replacement of Ce or Ti with a dopant of lower formal charge causes an electron deficit that weakens the bond of some of the surface oxygen atoms to the oxide. Another factor affecting OVFE is the crystal structure. For example, the structure of the oxides of copper differs from that of TiO2 (rutile with tetragonal crystal lattice) and CeO2 (fluorite crystal lattice) and therefore a Cu atom substituting a Ti or a Ce atom finds itself surrounded by the wrong number of oxygen atoms, located at the wrong distances and wrong angles. Cu prefers a coordination of two (in Cu2O) or four (in CuO) oxygen atoms, and when it substitutes for a Ti atom in rutile it is surrounded by six atoms (in the bulk; at the surface the numbers depend on the face being considered). This situation disrupts the ability of the oxygen atoms to form bonds with the dopant and makes them more reactive.Given the small number of systems studied so far, it is difficult to determine if there any rules that may govern how a dopant will affect the oxygen atoms in a given host oxide. Because of this, we decided to perform density functional calculations of the energy of oxygen vacancy formation at the surface of a ZnO(1010) slab doped with almost all cations in the periodic table. We have chosen ZnO for two reasons. First, it allows us to study many dopants that have a larger formal charge than the Zn ions they substitute; we have not yet examined such a situation in our previous work. Second, Ti and Ce can switch from a +4 oxidation state to a +3 one and are able to compensate for the disruption caused by doping. Zn has only a +2 oxidation state and lacks this flexibility. We were hoping that adding these doped compounds to the existing theoretical data base will help clarify the mechanism through which doping affects the reactivity of the surface oxygen nearby.We find that Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Os, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd decrease OVFE and prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO. Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, Ce, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Al, Ga, Sn, and Pb increase the OVFE; among these Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Co, Sn, and Pb prefer to substitute a Zn atom at the surface while the remainder are happier substituting a Zn atom in the bulk.
2. Computational Methodology
The calculations are based on DFT 36,37 performed using a plane wave basis set 38 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package. 39,40 The electronion interactions are treated with the projector augmented wave method in which all the electrons, except the valence ones, are kept frozen. 41 Exchange-correlation energy was calculated using the PW-91 generalized gradient approximation functional. A slab with five layers and a (2 × 3)-ZnO(1010) surface super-cell (Figure 1) was used for studying the energy of oxygen vacancy formation. With this supercell, when we make a vacancy we remove one in six oxygen atoms at the surface of the slab. A plane-wave cutoff of 280 eV was used for all dopants except Na, Ce, Ni, and Pd for which the cut off of was 400 eV. With an energy cut off of 280 eV, the relative energies are converged to less than 0.05 eV. The k-points grid was 2 × 2 × 1. For a few systems, we have increased it to 4 × 4 × 1, and this changed the relative energies by less than 0.05 eV. The total energy is converged to 10-2 eV/super cell. We have allowed fractional occupancy of bands by using Gaussian smearing with an energy window of 0.05 eV. All calculations were spin-polarized and the program picked automatically the spin state having the lowest energy. The computed bulk lattice constants of ZnO were found to be a = 3.282 Å, c/a = 1.6176 and u = 0.378. The calculated heat of formation is 3.41 eV, which is close to the previous experiments 42,43 and computations. 44-46 Figure 1 A 2 × 3-ZnO(1010) super-cell.

3. Results
3.1.Trends in Oxygen Vacancy Formation Energy in Doped ZnO. The OVFE in doped ZnO(1010) is shown in Figure 2. We did not consider Be, which is toxic, and Tc, which is radioactive. In the box corresponding to a dopant, the magnitude of the OVFE is given by the numbers in normal font (at the top of each box). For example, the OVFE for undoped ZnO(1010) is 3.3 eV and is given in the box for Zn. The dopants in the boxes shaded gray decrease OVFE (as compared to the undoped ZnO), and the dopants in the unshaded boxes increase it. The energy difference between the total energy for the slab with the dopant at the surface and the total energy when the dopant is in the bulk is given by the numbers in italic font (at the bottom of each box). The dopants in the boxes having a line across the diagonal are more stable when they substitute a Zn atom at the surface than when they substitute a Zn atom in the bulk.
Figure 2 In each box, the top number (normal font) is the OVFE (in eV) for the doped oxide (for example, the OVFE for W-doped ZnO is 5.4 eV). The dopants in gray boxes decrease OVFE, as compared to the OVFE of pure ZnO. The numbers at the bottom of each box (italic font) give the energy difference between a slab with the dopant substituting Zn at the surface and one with the dopant substituting Zn in the bulk (for example, Ta dopant prefers substituting in the bulk by 1.2 eV and K prefers substituting at the surface by 1.8 eV). Boxes with a line on the diagonal contain dopants that segregate at the surface.To present our results we divide the dopants into five classes. This division is not rigorous and is based on the magnitude of the effect of the dopant on the OVFE. The first class contains Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs, all of which decrease OVFE substantially, as compared to the OVFE of undoped ZnO. The effect is about the same for all members of the class. All dopants of this class form oxides with chemical formula D2O. We believe that the bond of the oxygen atom to the oxide is weakened mainly because we replaced a cation with formal charge +2 with a dopant whose formal charge is +1. This creates an electron deficit in the doped region and weakens the bond of the oxygen atoms to the oxide. In addition, the oxides of the alkali dopants have antifluorite structure while ZnO structure is wurtzite; therefore, there is a coordination mismatch between the dopant and the oxygen atoms in the host oxide. The computed cohesive energy of ZnO is 9.02 eV per Zn atom, whereas the computed cohesive energy of Li2O, Na2O, K2O, Rb2O, Cs2O is 7.18, 5.66, 4.95, 4.77, and 4.71 eV per alkali metal atom, respectively. The smaller cohesive energy of alkali metal oxide suggests that the surface oxygen makes a weaker bond with the dopant and it is therefore easier to remove. However, the connection between the OVFE and the binding energy of the dopant's oxide does not hold for most dopants we have studied. The ionic radius is of secondary importance if the dopant substitutes a Zn atom at the surface; a large dopant can move toward the vacuum side of the surface to relieve strain. The ion size matters if the dopant is located inside the bulk.Note that when an alkali dopant having a lesser formal charge substitutes a Zn atom at the surface of ZnO, the decrease in OVFE is not enough to create an oxygen vacancy spontaneously.In the second class we placed Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, which have the same formal charge in their oxides as Zn in ZnO (i.e., the stoichiometry of alkali-earth metal oxide is the same as that of ZnO). The presence of any of these dopants in place of Zn stabilizes the oxygen atoms (they make it harder to make an oxygen vacancy). Because the oxidation state of the alkaline-earth cations in their own oxide is the same as that of Zn in ZnO, we can use them to estimate how the coordination mismatch between the dopants and oxygen affects the OVFE. We do this by calculating the cohesive energy per atom of the alkaline earth oxides in the rock salt structure and also in the wurtzite structure. In both calculations, we optimized the lattice distances. This kind of analysis is possible because the potential energy surface of the alkali-earth oxides happens to have a local minimum at the wurtzite structure. The results of these calculations are shown in Table 1. The energy difference between the cohesive energy of rock salt and wurtzite structures is very small, when compared to the effect of the alkali earth dopants on OVFE. We conclude therefore that the change in coordination is not a major factor in determining the change of OVFE upon doping. The cohesive energy of the alkaline-earth oxides is larger than that of ZnO, and the change is OVFE with the dopant tracks roughly the cohesive energy of the dopant's oxide. This may be the main factor in the change of OVFE upon doping for this class. However, we do not find the same trend in other classes studied here.Table 1: The Cohesive Energies of ZnO and of the Alkaline-Earth Oxides Per Cation in eVa oxide cubicrocksalt structure hexagonalwurtzite structure ZnO   9.02 MgO 12.09 11.95 CaO 12.99 12.68 SrO 12.11 11.90 BaO 11.62 11.47 aIn the second column, we give the cohesive energy obtained in a calculation in which we have imposed a rocksalt structure but allowed the lattice parameters to vary until minimum energy is reached. In the third column, we give the cohesive energy calculated by imposing the wurtzite structure and varying the lattice parameter to minimize the total energy.The third class consists of all the dopants from group 3 to group 7 of the periodic table (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta, W, Re, La, and Ce). We place them in one class because they all increase substantially the OVFE. All these dopants can form oxides in which their oxidation state is greater than 2. The most stable oxide formed by transition metals in group 3, 4, and 5 have oxidation states +3, +4, and +5, with chemical formulas D2O3, DO2, and D2O5 respectively. La and Ce have +3 and +4 oxidation states in their most stable oxides. In group 6, Cr has +3 oxidation state in its most stable oxide with chemical formula D2O3, and Mo and W have an oxidation state of +6 in their most stable oxides. In group 7, Mn has a +2 oxidation state in its most stable oxide, although it can form oxides with higher oxidation state (Mn2O3 and MnO2). The oxidation state of Re in its most stable oxidation state is +7 with chemical formula Re2O7. The strength of oxides formed by group 3 to group 7 is higher than that of ZnO.43 The oxides of group 4 of the periodic table are among the most stable metal oxides with standard free energy of formation (at p = 1 atm, T = 298 K) 9.21 eV, 10.75 eV, 10.92 eV, for of TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2, respectively.43 This is much greater than that of ZnO (3.29 eV),43 and the transition metal oxides of group 4 of the periodic table increase the OVFE more than all other dopants. The free energy of formation of the most stable oxide of the dopant helps in rationalizing some trends within a limited set of dopants, but it does not help in predicting relative magnitude of OVFE when a wider set of dopants are considered. For example, we have the following results of the oxides from group 5: (V2O5, 14.81 eV, 4.9 eV), (Nb2O5, 18.36 eV, 5.6 eV), (Ta2O5, 19.81 eV, 5.8 eV),43 where the first number in parenthesis gives the standard free energy of formation of the oxide and the second number gives the OVFE of doped ZnO (with V, Nb, or Ta, respectively). We see that as the free energy of oxide formation increases, the OVFE increases. But although these oxides have greater free energy of formation compared to oxides from group 4, they have smaller OVFE. We have to conclude that while we can group the dopants in various classes according to the amount by which they affect OVFE, it is very difficult to find a reliable trend or a rationalization for the computed values.Class four contains Fe, Ru, Os, Co, Rh, Ir, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, and Cd. Among these, only Au and Ag cause a substantial lowering of OVFE, comparable to that caused by alkali dopants. We note again the lack of correlation between OVFE and the properties of the dopant's oxide.The final class includes Al, Sn, Ga, and Pb, and they all increase OVFE. The oxidation state of Al and Ga is +3 in their oxides, Sn has +4 oxidation state in SnO2, and Pb has +2 oxidation state in its most stable oxide PbO (Pb also forms PbO2). The bond strength in the oxides of these dopants is greater than that of ZnO.We were unsuccessful in our attempts to correlate the magnitude of OVFE with other properties of the dopants like: the ionization energy, the electronegativity, the chemical hardness, and the covalent or the ionic radius. Although some of these properties may be used for rationalizing trends in OVFE for a limited set of dopants, none of them are applicable for all the dopants. Qualitative methods like bond valence modeling 47 and tight binding theories for obtaining formation energy of a substitutional dopant 48 were attempted but did not lead to a predictive approach that may be used in lieu of computationally intensive atomistic simulations. At present, density functional simulations have to be performed for each particular dopant-oxide pair to obtain the trends in OVFE in a reliable manner.
3.2. The Location of the Dopant: at the Surface or in the Bulk? To be useful in catalysis, the dopant must replace a Zn atom at the surface of the oxide or in the first layer below the surface. In experiments, the position of the dopant will depend on the method of preparation; the kinetics of preparation will control the structure. If the preparation temperature is low or no annealing is performed so that the mobility of the dopant is very small, the dopant will be stuck in the position it happened to be when the solid oxide was formed. Given the complexity of the preparation methods, a reliable (or even an unreliable) simulation of the distribution of the dopant in the solid is not possible at this time.
Once the doped oxide has been made, one needs to know how stable the structure will be when exposed for a long time to the catalytic conditions. If these require high temperatures, the dopants will migrate to form a thermodynamically stable structure. This thermodynamically favored structure can be predicted semiquantitatively by calculating the total energies of the systems of interest. Here, we compare the energy of ZnO with the dopant in the surface layer to the energy of ZnO with the dopant in the bulk. The system with lower energy is more stable. This is of course approximate because one should compare free energies. However, if the temperature is not very high the entropic contribution (Temperature*Entropy) to the free energy is negligible and the contribution of the vibrations to the enthalpy is small. In such cases, the total energy is a good indicator of the stability of the system (if the energy difference between two candidates exceeds the thermal energy).
The total energy of the slab with the dopant at the surface minus the total energy of the same slab with the dopant in the bulk are given in Figure 2 at the bottom of each box (in italic font). For these calculations, the energies have been sampled only at the gamma point. A negative value indicates that the dopant prefers to be located at the surface. As with the OVFE, we find no general pattern in the results, but there is a propensity that dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to be located at the surface. However, Ca, Sr, Ba, La, Ce, Re, Fe, Ru, Sn, and Pb, which increase OVFE, also segregate to the surface. However, some rationalization of these results is possible. A dopant at the surface forms fewer bonds with oxygen than a dopant in the bulk. If the dopant-oxygen bond is weaker than the ZnO bond, then less binding energy is lost if the dopant is at the surface. This may explain why the dopants that decrease OVFE prefer to substitute a surface Zn atom. In addition, when the size of a dopant is bigger than that of Zn, it will prefer to be located at the surface where the stress can be released by a displacement of the dopant toward the vacuum. For example, for Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs the preference of being located at the surface clearly increases with the dopant size.
The increase in size of the atom also affects the structure of doped oxide around a dopant substituting a surface Zn atom. In Figure 3, the coordination structure before and after creation of the VO is shown for the smallest (Li) and the largest (Cs) dopants in class 1. The large Cs dopant moves outward and away from the three oxygen atoms to which it is coordinated. The bigger alkali metal dopants, Rb and K, have a structure similar to that of Cs.
Figure 3 (a) This structure shows Li substituting Zn in ZnO(1010) and (b) shows Cs substituting Zn. The hatched sphere indicates the dopant, the light gray spheres are the Zn atoms, and the dark gray spheres are the O atoms. In (b), we see that the large Cs atom moves away from the surface to relieve strain. In a surface without an oxygen vacancy, all the dopants are coordinated to three O atoms, the only difference among the dopants being its bond distance to O. (c) The structure of LixZn1-xO surfaces with an oxygen vacancy is shown and (d) shows the structure of CsxZn1-xO. The oxygen vacancy is denoted by a hollow sphere. In a surface with oxygen vacancy, the dopants are coordinated to two oxygen atoms, and different dopants have different distances from the surface oxygen atoms.
All alkaline earth dopants, except Mg, prefer to be at the surface even though their bond with oxygen is strong. This is primarily due to their large size, as is evident from their structure, which is similar to that of Cs.
As the dopants from group 3 to group 7 form strong oxygen bonds leading to increase in OVFE, it is not surprising that they prefer to substitute Zn in the bulk rather than in the surface. The larger lanthanide atoms, La and Ce, which belong to period 7 of the periodic table, prefer to segregate to the surface with their coordination structure similar to that of Cs. Sn and Pb also behave in a similar manner, preferring to substitute a surface Zn atom due to their bigger size, even though they may increase OVFE.
Conclusions The Marsvan Krevelen mechanism for catalytic oxidation by oxides has two essential steps. First, the oxide must be a good oxidant, willing to give oxygen to the reactant and create oxygen vacancies on the surface. Second, the oxygen vacancies must be able to adsorb an oxygen molecule and activate it so that it gives an oxygen atom to the molecule being oxidized and the other atom to the oxide to heal the oxygen vacancy on the surface. Here, we have studied to what extent doping makes ZnO a better oxidant. We characterized the oxidative power of a doped oxide qualitatively by calculating by how much doping reduces the energy needed for removing oxygen from the surface to make an oxygen vacancy and half an oxygen molecule in the gas phase. We found that alkali dopants, as well as Ag and Au, are particularly active in weakening the bond of surface oxygen to the oxide with Pt, Pd, Cd, Ir, and Rh being less active. All other dopants either cause a small change in OVFE or strengthen considerably the bond between surface oxygen and the oxide. These doped oxides will not be better Marsvan Krevelen oxidants than ZnO. There is, however, a possibility that a dopant with high formal charge (e.g., Ti, Ce, V, Nb, etc.) is substantially activated when it replaces a Zn atom in the lattice, in which case it may adsorb and activate a gas-phase O2 molecule. We have preliminary results indicating that this is the case for Ti-doped ZnO. It is also possible that in a doped oxide, either the dopant or the oxygen atoms bound to the dopant are so active that they may be able to break CH or OH bonds, which is the first step in oxidative dehydrogenation. We are performing calculation to test to what extent this is the case. Our overall conclusion is that there is hope that among so many possible dopantoxide host pairs there are some promising oxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.
It is also worth pointing out that for some systems we have studied, the doped oxide is willing to lose easily a single oxygen atom in the neighborhood of the dopant. Once an oxygen vacancy is formed, the removal of a second oxygen atom becomes more difficult. This feature may be important in controlling selectivity, because it implies that there is a temperature range in which the active center will only provide one oxygen atom for an oxidation reaction. This may favor partial oxidation and makes oxidation to CO2 and water unlikely.
The model used here contains two weak points. Highly dispersed catalysts have a large number of steps, kinks, mesas, and other morphological features on their surface. The calculations performed here are relevant only for the flat facets of such oxides. In addition, it is well-known that DFT may have difficulties with some properties of some narrow band oxides (transition metal oxides and lanthanide oxides). Until the extent of these difficulties is clarified, the present results should be considered semiquantitative; the trends are more reliable than the absolute numbers. Finally, there are no experiments to which we could compare our results, and we hope that this work will encourage the synthesis and the study of these systems.
