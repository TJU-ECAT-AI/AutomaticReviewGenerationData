Understanding the surface chemistry of TiO2 is key to the development and optimisation of many technologies, such as solar power, catalysis, gas sensing, medical implantation, and corrosion protection. In order to address this, considerable research effort has been directed at model single crystal surfaces of TiO2. Particular attention has been given to the rutile TiO2(110) surface because it is the most stable face of TiO2. In this critical review, we discuss the chemical reactivity of TiO2(110), focusing in detail on four molecules/classes of molecules. The selected molecules are water, oxygen, carboxylic acids, and alcoholsall of which have importance not only to industry but also in nature (173 references).
1.
Introduction Given the importance of TiO2 surface chemistry in a variety of technologies,17 such as solar cells, catalysis, gas sensing,medical implantation, and corrosion protection, it is hardly surprising that there is a tremendous drive to probe and enhance the chemical reactivity of this material. Currently,research in this field is wide-ranging, with activity extending from synthesis of novel titania based structures (e.g. nano- tubes8) to fundamental work aiming to comprehend surface chemistry at the atomic scale (see, for example, ref. 9). This latter effort is typically concerned with studies of model low Miller index single crystal surfaces under ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions, in order to simplify the problem. Here, to celebrate Gehard Ertls Nobel Chemistry Prize for his studies of chemical processes on solid surfaces,10 we review such fundamental studies of chemical processes on TiO2, focusing on the rutile TiO2(110) surface.
To date, rutile TiO2(110) is the most studied single crystal TiO2 surface. Indeed, its 11 termination has emerged as the prototypical metal oxide surface for fundamental studies. It serves as a playground for researchers exploring a wide variety of important topics, including surface chemistry at both regular terrace sites and defects. A number of factors have contributed to this surfaces pre-eminence for such work,including the ready availability of high quality crystals, its significant electrical conductivity following annealing in va- cuum, and the relative simplicity of the geometric structure of the 11 phase.
In this critical review, we are not only concerned with the chemistry of TiO2(110)11, but also that of the reconstructed 12 phase(s). We concentrate on the reactivity of these surfaces with a number of technologically important mole- cules, namely H2O, O2, R(COOH)n, and R(OH)n, updating information provided in the seminal review of the surface science of TiO2 by Diebold.11 Prior to discussing the reactivity of TiO2(110) with the various molecules, we present pertinent details of the structure of the clean 11 and 12 surfaces.

Clean surface Key to the value of surface chemistry studies on model substrates is a detailed knowledge of clean surface structure.
Without this information, mechanistic interpretation of reac- tions can at best be speculative, at worst simply incorrect.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online Fig. 1 displays a pseudo-space-filling model of the ideal bulk-terminated TiO2(110)11 surface, consisting of so-called bridging oxygens (Ob), 5-fold titaniums (Ti5c), and in-plane oxygens at the solidvacuum interface. The presence of this structure, following typical UHV surface preparation compris- ing inert gas ion bombardment and annealing cycles, has been confirmed experimentally using various quantitative probes of surface crystallography.1218 The most cited of these studies to date is a surface X-ray diffraction (SXRD) study published by Charlton et al. in 1997.12 Given that the displacements of the 11 topmost oxygen and titanium atoms (Ti(1)Ti(4) and O(1)O(7) in Fig. 2) were determined with significant preci- sion, this structure has been considered a benchmark by many researchers. However, there has been debate about the com- plete accuracy of the optimised structure, with the bridging oxygen atom (O(1) in Fig. 2) being of primary concern. This situation has motivated a recent re-examination of the relaxa- tion of the TiO2(110)11 surface, employing a number of quantitative structural probes,1518 including a more recent SXRD study.18 Table 1 lists the atomic displacements corresponding to the optimised structures emerging from the various recent experi- mental studies,1518 along with those from Charlton et al.s work.12 It is clear from this table that none of the latter work replicates the relaxation of the bridging oxygen (O(1)) towards the bulk determined in ref. 12, rather all find that the oxygen Fig. 2 Ball and stick model of TiO2(110)11.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online shifts away from the bulk. Furthermore, the displacements of almost all other optimised atoms are quantitatively similar across all of these recent measurements. Agreement is most impressive for the quantitative low energy electron diffraction (LEED-IV)15 and the latest SXRD18 experiments, as many of the atomic displacements have been determined with high precision (the error bars associated with the medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and photoelectron diffraction (PhD) structures are typically somewhat larger).
Comparing experiment with first-principles calculations of the geometric structure of TiO2(110)11, these two strands of effort are apparently beginning to converge. In particular, no recent theoretical studies predict that the bridging oxygen (O(1)) relaxes significantly towards the bulk; it either main- tains its ideal bulk-terminated position,19,20 or shifts away from the bulk.2123 However, exact atomic coordinates are dependent on the theoretical approach adopted, and further work is required to establish a fully reliable, quantitative theoretical description of the atomic geometry of TiO2(110)11.
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) images of TiO2(110)11 are also consistent with the structure displayed in Fig. 1 and 2 (see, for example, refs. 11, 2428), although no further insight into the coordinates of surface atoms is gained. The real value of these probes is the visualisation of surface imperfections,such as step edges, which are not normally accessible to spatially integrating diffraction/scattering techniques. Of par- ticular importance, as regards surface chemistry, are bridging oxygen vacancies (Ob-vacs), which are the primary point defects on this surface. Following standard substrate prepara- tion in UHV, several percent of bridging oxygen atoms are missing;28 the concentration of Ob-vacs can be controlled through variation of the annealling temperature.29 Given sufficient lateral resolution and appropriate tip condition,these thermally induced vacancies can be imaged by both scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (STM), and non-contact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM). Almost all published STM images show missing Ob as bright protrusions on dark rows (see Fig. 3), the bright rows of the perfect terraces being due to Ti5c rather than Ob.24,25 STM images can also be obtained in which dark spots appear on bright rows but because such images are not well understood they will not be discussed further in this review.26 In both these cases and in all other STM images presented in this review, positive tunnelling is used so that electrons tunnel from filled tip states into empty states of the sample. In NC-AFM, the Ob-vacs are usually observed as dark depressions on bright rows, which in this case are the Ob rows.27 Besides locally perturbing the geometry of TiO2(110)11, Ob-vacs give rise to an occupied band gap state (BGS), which from resonant photoemission is known to have primarily Ti 3d character.3032 This BGS can be directly observed spectro- scopically,3036 as demonstrated by Fig. 4, which displays valence band photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) spectra from (i) defect free TiO2(110)11, and (ii) TiO2(110)11 decorated with Ob-vacs. It is also generally accepted that the presence of this defect state is reflected in Ti 2p core level PES by the appearance of a low binding energy shoulder, shifted by
B1.7 eV from the primary peak. Typically, these features
are nominally assigned to Ti3+ and Ti4+, respectively,although it is clear from both experiment and theoretical modelling that bonding in TiO2 has significant covalent char- acter.23,30,31 Very recently, the spatial distribution of the electronic charge associated with the Ob-vac induced BGS has been probed by scanned-angle mode PhD at the Ti 2pTi 3d resonance.37 It is concluded that the charge is distributed across several Ti atoms, both surface and subsurface, with the majority being located on a second layer Ti (Ti(3) in Fig. 2). Only a small amount of the charge is possessed by surface layer titaniums (Ti(1) and Ti(2) in Fig. 2).
In addition to surface reduction, annealing a TiO2(110) sample in UHV leads to substoichiometry in the bulk, which is indicated by changes in sample colour.38 A pristine stoichio- metric TiO2 single crystal sample is transparent, but with increasing bulk reduction becomes green-blue, light/dark blue,and finally dark blue-black.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online crystals, the (110) surface also reconstructs, usually to either a simple 12 or a cross-linked 12 phase.3954 Various models for the geometric structure of simple TiO2(110)12 have been reported in the literature. Initially, on the basis of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), a simple missing- row model was suggested, formed by the loss of alternate rows of bridging oxygen from the bulk terminated 11 surface.39 On the basis of high resolution SPM images, this model has fallen out of favour to be replaced by models involving added rows. Onishi and Iwasawa have proposed that these added rows have Ti2O3 stoichiometry, although not the structure found in bulk Ti2O3 crystals.40,41 Pang et al. have hypothesised a contrasting model,comprising Ti3O5 added rows, which is supported by theoretical simulations of their STM images.42,43 Another model, developed by Park et al., involves added Ti2O rows.44 Recently, Blanco-Rey et al. have removed the uncertainty surrounding the identity of the simple 12 added rows,through the employment of LEED-IV.45,46 They have demons- trated that the added rows have the Ti2O3 architecture suggested by Onishi and Iwasawa.40,41 Fig. 5 shows a ball and stick model of the structure, and Table 2 lists atomic coordinates of optimised atoms. This geometry is supported by electron stimulated desorption ion angular distribution
(ESDIAD)
data,47 ion scattering measurements,48 and ab initio calculations.49,50 Further STM studies, by Bennett et al., suggest that the exact nature of the TiO2(110) reconstruction is dependent on the extent of the bulk reduction of the TiO2 sample.51 They have found that more stoichiometric samples (medium blue) exhibit the simple 12 reconstruction, but that well-reduced substrates (blue-black) display an x-linked 12 structure. In addition to added rows, STM images (see Fig. 6) of this latter phase show the presence of cross shaped structures connecting neighbouring 12 rows, very roughly one every 12 unit cells in the [001] direction. Bennett et al. also conclude that the structure of the added rows is different on simple 12 and x-linked 12 surfaces. They assign the simple 12 added-rows to Onishi and Iwasawas Ti2O3 model,40,41 whereas they suggest that x-linked 12 added rows are consistent with a slightly modified version of Pang et al.s model,42,43 in which an additional oxygen is incorporated into the added rows i.e.
Ti3O5 becomes Ti3O6. However, this assignment of the x-linked added rows to Ti3O6 is disputed. For instance, it is claimed in ref. 52 that they have the Onishi and Iwasawa Ti2O3 structure. Unpublished LEED-IV and SXRD data53 also support a Ti2O3 stoichiometry for the x-linked added rows.

Water TiO2 photocatalyses the splitting of water, and it is this photoactivity which underpins the use of TiO2 in green technology such as self-cleaning windows, air/water purifica- tion devices, and novel solar cells. Moreover, water is present in virtually all conceivable technological applications of TiO2.
As such, the interaction of water with TiO2 surfaces is a crucial area of research.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online Here, we examine the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs, the properties of water layers, and TiO2(110) under ambient water pressures. Given that the enormous body of work discussing water adsorption on TiO2(110) has been extensively reviewed by Henderson in 200255 and summarised again in Diebolds review,11 we will introduce earlier work only briefly and focus on the significant advances made in this area in the past few years. As there are very few studies of water on the 12 terminations,56 only work on the 11 surface will be consid- ered in this section.
Throughout this review, the coverage of molecules adsorbed on TiO2(110) will be given in monolayers (ML), where 1 ML corresponds to one adsorbate per primitive surface unit cell.
Gas and vapour exposures will be given in Langmuirs (L) where 1 L = 1.33  106 mbar s.
3.1
Water dissociation Nearly all experimental studies of water adsorption on TiO2(110)11 indicate that water dissociates only at Ob-vacs,as shown in the reaction scheme in Fig. 7. Water fills the vacancy and one of the hydrogen atoms splits offleaving a bridging hydroxyl group (OHb) at the vacancy. The hydrogen atom sits on a nearby bridging O atom, forming another OHb species.
Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) spectra of water on TiO2(110) give peaks at B163 K, B175 K, B265 K, and B490 K, as shown in Fig. 8.5760 For now, we will discuss only the two higher temperature peaks.
When the surface was isotopically enriched with 18O before exposure to H2
16O, H2
18O was preferentially desorbed at B490 K.59 This not only shows that the B490 K peak must arise from the recombination of dissociated water, it also indicates that the hydrogen atoms of OHb can diffuse to other Ob sites. As the coverage of water (B0.09 ML) desorbed in the B490 K peak matches expectations of the Ob-vac concentra- tion,57 it was concluded that water dissociates at the Ob-vacs.60 In contrast, only H2 16O desorbed at B265 K, suggestive of molecular adsorption.
These peaks were further identified with molecular and dissociative adsorption using static secondary ion mass spec- trometry (SSIMS), as shown in Fig. 8. TiO(H2O)+ and TiO(OH)+ peaks were monitored as a function of anneal temperature following exposure to water. The TiO(H2O)+ signal falls to zero at B265 K whereas the TiO(OH)+ signal attentuates at B490 K.60 As discussed in section 2, spectroscopic probes detect a BGS
B0.80.9 eV below EF which is associated with Ob-vacs.3032
Resonant PES spectra show that water exposure even up to 100 L (at B300 K) does not attenuate the defect state,indicating that electronically the Ob-vacs are not healed by water,33 a conclusion also formed on the basis of electron energy loss (EELS) data.34 In line with these observations,theoretical calculations have recently detected the presence of BGS for both Ob-vacs and OHb.61 Brookes et al.62 used STM at a range of temperatures in order to observe this water dissociation, as shown in Fig. 9.
The key result was a switch from bright spots being adsorbed on the bright rows at r200 K to bright spots appearing Fig. 7 Schematic depictions of water dissociation on TiO2(110). Blue and red spheres denote lattice O and Ti, respectively. The light blue spheres are Ob atoms, which lie in the [001] azimuth of the substrate.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online between bright rows at B290 K. The bright spots at r200 K were assigned to molecular water adsorbed on Ti5c sites. As the concentration of the bright spots at B290 K is about
B0.08 ML, Brookes et al.62 infer that they represent OHb
formed from water dissociated in Ob-vacs.
By imaging the reaction dynamically, STM has the power to directly follow the dissociation of water in Ob-vacs. However,an obvious prerequisite is that Ob-vacs must be unambigu- ously identified in STM images. As discussed in section 2, STM images of TiO2(110) are generally thought to show Ob-vacs as bright spots on dark Ob rows.24 However, based on STM imaging and electron stimulated desorption (ESD) experiments, Suzuki et al.63 suggested that these bright spots (also known as type-A defects) originate from OHb; the source of hydrogen being residual water vapour or H2 in the vacuum chamber. Schaub et al.64 partially resolved this issue by showing the presence of two kinds of type-A defects (see Fig. 10). The brighter (Ab) defects were assigned to Ob-vacs and the darker (Ad) defects to OHb.
The evidence for this assignment was two-fold. First, their DFT simulations of STM images suggest that Ob-vacs should be brighter than OHb. Second, the concentration of type-A defects after exposing TiO2(110) to water was counted to be about twice the number of Ab defects before exposure, con- sistent with water dissociation in Ob-vacs forming two OHb species.
Evidence accumulated over the past few years, how- ever,28,6569 reverses the assignment of type-A defects by Schaub et al.64 One of the keys to distinguishing OHb from Ob-vacs was suggested by studies in which the STM tip was scanned over the TiO2(110) surface at a raised voltage of +3 V. Type-A defects were removed from the surface and interpreted as tip-induced refilling of Ob-vacs by Diebold et al.70 and as tip-induced removal of hydrogen from OHb by Suzuki et al.63 Bikondoa et al.28,65 removed individual type-A defects with electrical pulses at ca. +3 V, as shown in Fig. 10. Crucially,only Ab defects could be removed in this way and this was used as a means to distinguish the two types of defects. Ab defects were removed by scanning at a raised bias of +3 V, creating an Ab defect-free region (the clean-offarea) before exposing to water, as shown in Fig. 11. If the Ab defects are Ob-vacs as suggested by Schaub et al.,64 then exposure to water should have little effect in the clean-offarea as there would be no Ob-vacs to react with. On the other hand, if the Ad defects are Ob-vacs, then exposure of the surface to water should replen- ish the Ab defects in the clean-offarea, due to water molecules dissociating in the Ob-vacs.
It turned out that exposure of the surface to water led to the replenishment of Ab defects in the clean-offarea (Fig. 11c), so that Ab defects were assigned to OHb and Ad defects to Ob-vacs. This also means that the ca. +3 V scans and tip pulses desorbed hydrogen from the OHb groups. Whilst the mechan- ism for this hydrogen desorption is as yet unknown, it may be related to an empty state identified by Onda et al.71 using two- photon photoemission (2PP) spectroscopy and assigned as a wet electron state; a wet electron state being a partially hydrated state. This state was found B2.4 eV above EF,maximising when OHb coexists with 1 ML of molecular water.
Returning to Fig. 11c: because STM images were recorded from the same area before and after exposure to water, it can be seen that some of the new OHb reside in positions pre- viously taken by Ob-vacs. Thus Bikondoa et al.28,65 imaged water dissociating in the Ob-vacs forming one OHb in place of the Ob-vacs and another OHb group elsewhere, in line with the mechanism depicted in Fig. 7. Low temperature STM experi- ments indicate that water dissociation occurs as low as B187 K,68 which matches conclusions from high resolution
EELS (HREELS).34
One curiosity is that the number of OHb in positions previously taken by Ob-vacs is always slightly higher than the number found elsewhere. According to the mechanism in Fig. 7, an equal number of OHb should be found at the Ob-vacs and away from them. Wendt et al.67,68 propose that immediately after water molecules dissociate, the two resulting OHb sit next to each other in the [001] direction. In such a configuration, individual OHb from the pair are difficult to resolve in STM images and each OHb pair therefore appears as Fig. 9

In some images, type-A defects with three apparent sizes can be seen,the largest assigned to OHb pairs, the next largest to isolated OHb, and the smallest to Ob-vacs.6569 These general trends have been reproduced in the latest STM simulations of Ob-vacs and OHb.66,72 The unambiguous assignment of OHb and Ob-vacs in STM images enabled point defects in NC-AFM images of TiO2(110) to be identified definitively as well. Fig. 12 shows an STM image alongside a simultaneously recorded NC-AFM image.
The STM image was recorded simply by applying a bias between the NC-AFM tip and sample, during otherwise standard NC-AFM operation, and recording the tunnelling current. By correlating the positions of the dark spots in the NC-AFM image with OHb and Ob-vacs in the STM image, Pang et al.73 show that the dark spots correspond to both OHb and Ob-vacs. It then follows that the bright rows in the NC-AFM image must correspond to Ob rows. The assignment of both OHb and Ob-vacs (which are in reality protrusions and depressions, respectively) to depressions in the NC-AFM image is significant because it means the intuitive idea that NC-AFM faithfully traces the true surface topography must be rejected.
In further support of this, NC-AFM images recorded by both Pang et al.74 and Lauritsen et al.75 show that adventitious tip changes can give images with differing contrasts. As shown in Fig. 13, Pang et al.74 recorded a pair of NC-AFM images between which such a tip change occurs. In the first image,type-A defects appear as depressions in the bright Ob rows like in Fig. 12b, whereas in the second image, the type-A defects appear as bright features between bright rows; the latter must therefore be assigned to Ti5c rows. One way in which a tip may change is in the polarity of the apex and the observed contrast Fig. 13

Diffusion of water dissociation products Wendt et al.68 and Zhang et al.69 tracked the diffusion of the OHb following water dissociation. STM movies at B187 K showed that the OHb pairs separate along the [1 10] direction via proton exchange with water molecules.68 Snapshots of the movie are displayed in Fig. 14. These movies were supported by calculations of the potential energy profile, which show that the barrier to diffusion is lowered by this exchange with water.
Sequential NC-AFM images also capture the splitting of the OHb pairs at room temperature.76 The same diffusion mechan- ism occurs for isolated OHb and it should be noted that because of the erroneous assignment of OHb and Ob-vacs by Schaub et al.,64 this water-mediated diffusion of OHb was mistakenly reported as oxygen-mediated diffusion of Ob-vacs,77,78 via a mechanism inconsistent with subsequent isotope studies.79 In addition to this water-assisted diffusion, Zhang et al.69 observed OHb pairs separating along the [001] direction, as shown in Fig. 15. By carefully analysing the positions of the OHb, it was shown that the first hop is usually taken by the OHb which does not fill the Ob-vac. Therefore, contrary to previous expectations, the two OHb resulting from dissocia- tion of a water molecule appear to be inequivalent. Zhang et al. speculate that this is due to a different charge distribution around each OHb; the Ob-vac has two nominally Ti3+ ions beneath it so that when water dissociates, the OHb which sits in the vacancy is connected to two Ti3+ ions whereas the adjacent OHb is bound to only one Ti3+ ion, the other Ti ion being Ti4+. It is important to note this description of the charge distribution serves only as an indication that the charge around each OHb is likely to be different as it is clear from scanned angle PhD that the charge distribution around Ob-vacs is rather complicated (see section 2),37 and one would expect a similar situation for OHb.
3.3
Water layers Returning to the water TPD in Fig. 8, measurements by Hugenschmidt et al.57 show that the work function decreases with the coverage of the B265 K peak. This can be explained by the dipole created if water is molecularly adsorbed with its O atom (Owater) pointing down (negative) and the hydrogen up (positive). In such a configuration, one would expect water to sit on the Ti5c sites. This expectation was confirmed in subse- quently obtained low temperature STM images.62,64,67,68 Very recently, this bonding configuration was quantitatively exam- ined with scanned energy mode PhD.80,81A Ti5cOwater bond length of 2.21 A was found, indicating a more weakly bound chemisorbed species in comparison to other adsorbates on TiO2(110), such as formate (2.08 A ). Given that most theore- tical calculations overestimate the Ti5cOwater bond length (e.g. refs. 66, 82 and 83), it was suggested that a more accurate theoretical description of this bond could be used as a bench- mark in future theoretical modelling.
After the Ti5c sites are filled, a second layer of water can adsorb over the Ob sites corresponding to water in the B175 K TPD state. Exposures beyond the second layer leads to for- mation of multilayer water which desorbs at B163 K in TPD with the zero order desorption kinetics expected.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online The work function measurements by Hugenschmidt et al.57 show that water exposure beyond the first monolayer does not lead to any further work function changes. This was taken as evidence that the second layer water adsorbs parallel to the surface, presumably to allow hydrogen bonding to the first layer water. An OH stretch appeared in HREEL spectra below B3300 cm1 when the second layer of water was adsorbed. As stretching frequencies below B3400 cm1 are typical of hydrogen bonded
OH,84
the feature below B3300 cm1 suggests that the second layer water is hydrogen bonded. However, as the loss feature assigned to the mono- layer remained at B3505 cm1, neither shifting nor attenuat- ing, Henderson58 concluded that the hydrogen bonding does not involve the OH bonds of monolayer water.
New evidence has recently been given for hydrogen bonding between monolayer and second layer water molecules by an ESD study. Crucially, Petrik and Kimmel were able to form isotopically distinct bilayers of water.85 A monolayer of water was prepared by dosing one water isotope at 195 K. The second layer could then be prepared by dosing another water isotope below 70 K. By monitoring water evolution during ESD at temperatures above 70 K, Petrik and Kimmel gave evidence for HD exchange above 70 K and interlayer mixing of molecules above 90 K. Thus, it was concluded that the second water layer hydrogen bonds to the monolayer. When thicker water films (B3 ML) were electron bombarded at B100 K,86 H and H2 were detected, indicating that the bombardment causes water to dissociate.
3.4
Water at ambient pressures Ketteler et al.87,88 used a specially designed ambient pressure PES system to investigate water adsorption on TiO2(110) under pressures of up to B2 mbar. This was performed by tracking the respective core level PES signals from oxygen originating from molecular water and OHb. At the beginning of the measurements, the OHb coverage was twice the initial Ob-vac coverage, indicating that water had dissociated in the Ob-vacs, as expected on the basis of UHV experiments (see section 3.1 and refs. 28, 6569). As the water coverage was increased, either by decreasing the temperature at a fixed pressure (isobars) or by increasing the pressure at a fixed temperature (isotherms), the OHb concentration remains the same, showing that no further water dissociation occurred beyond that already attributed to Ob-vac dissociation.
The isotherms and isobars can be converted into a relative humidity measurement (RH) which is defined as p/pv(T) 100, where p is the pressure and pv is the equilibrium vapour pressure of bulk water or ice at the corresponding temperature (T). When the isobars and isotherms are plotted together, they follow the same curve. This indicates that the vapour and surface are in thermodynamic equilibrium. Fig. 16 shows coverage versus RH curves for three isobars. The water cover- age increases steadily with RH then plateaus as the OHb coverage is approached, after which the water coverage in- creases again with inflections at B2 ML and B3 ML.
From these results, Ketteler et al. suggest that OHb act as Brnsted acid sites, binding water into OHbH2O complexes.
These complexes themselves nucleate further water adsorption. As more water attaches to these nucleation cen- tres, the adsorption complex becomes less acidic and the water binding structure tends to that of the bulk liquid. This is achieved after adsorbing B2 ML of water.

Oxygen O2 like water is often present in environments where TiO2 might be used in technological applications. Added to this, the interaction of O2 and TiO2 is of direct importance in devices such as solar cells, gas sensors, and catalytic converters. In this section, we focus first on O2 adsorption chemistry. In parti- cular, we consider examples of dissociative and molecular adsorption as well as co-adsorption with water, before dis- cussing the reoxidation of the surface at high temperature.
4.1
O2 dissociation Numerous studies show that when TiO2(110) is exposed to O2,the Ob-vacs are healed. Kurtz et al.33 used resonant PES to show that when O2 is dosed at 400 K the BGS associated with Ob-vacs is essentially quenched with O2 exposure. Similar results were obtained by Pan et al.89 and Wang et al.35, the latter employing defective surfaces prepared by electron bom- bardment.
Onda et al.36 used 2PP spectroscopy to compare O2 adsorp- tion on defective surfaces created by electron bombardment and vacuum annealing. Their results suggest that defects created by electron bombardment perturb the work function less than those created by vacuum annealing. Furthermore, Onda et al. found that the BGS introduced by electron bombardment was quenched by only 0.3 L O2 at 100 K. In contrast, for a defective surface created by UHV annealing, Perkins and Henderson90 reported that the BGS detected by EELS was only removed after annealing the surface to 200 K, Fig. 16 Coverage of OHb and H2O obtained from three different isobars (1.33  102 to 2 mbar) as a function of relative humidity (RH). Filled blue circles are from the B0.01 mbar isobar, open circles the B0.53 mbar isobar, and open squares from the B1.33 mbar isobar. The temperature scale at the top corresponds to the 0.53 mbar isobar. There is a plateau for water at 0.25 ML when the coverage equals that of OHb. Modified from ref. 88 with permission. 2336  Chem.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online following exposure to O2 at 110 K. Onda et al.36 conclude that electron bombardment can lead to pure Ob-vac creation whereas vacuum annealing probably generates a variety of defects, only some of which are Ob-vacs.
Pan et al.89 prepared an oxidised surface by annealing and cooling TiO2(110) in 2.7  106 mbar O2. Low energy ion scattering (LEIS) from this surface showed no 18O uptake even after exposure to 500 L 18O2 at room temperature. On the other hand, when an equivalent experiment was performed on a UHV annealed surface, the 18O uptake had a saturation value of B0.08 ML, consistent with estimates of the Ob-vac density.33 Whilst these results indicate that exposure to O2 heals the Ob-vacs even at low temperatures (at least based on the electronic structure), the healing mechanism is yet to be addressed. Epling et al.91 posited four feasible scenarios whereby Ob-vac may be healed by O2: (1) two Ob-vacs are filled by one O2 molecule, (2) one Ob-vac is filled by an O atom from one O2 molecule with the other O atom being released into the gas phase, (3) one Ob-vac is filled by an O atom from one O2 molecule with the other O atom being incorporated into the bulk, and finally (4) one Ob-vac is filled by an O atom from one O2 molecule with the other O atom being adsorbed at the surface, most likely at a Ti5c site.
Epling et al.91 show that adsorbed oxygen in some form is left on the surface after the Ob-vacs are filled. The evidence comes from the perturbation of the TPD spectra of water and ammonia when the surface is pre-dosed with O2. For a TiO2(110) surface pre-dosed with O2 at 300 K, then exposed to water at 90 K, a new water TPD peak is found at B290 K.
Scenarios (1)(3) above should not have any effect on the reactivity of the TiO2(110) surface, so it was concluded that one Ob-vac is healed per O2 molecule with the other O atom being adsorbed at a Ti5c site (Oad), a dissociation mechanism supported by theoretical calculations.92,93 The B290 K peak can be explained as follows: water reacts with the Oad to form two OH groups bound to the Ti5c sites (OHt groups). As the temperature is ramped towards 300 K,water is desorbed, leaving an Oad at the surface again. To test that Oad is still present following desorption of water in the B290 K peak, Epling et al.91 first dosed O2 then water at 90 K.
A water TPD spectrum was then taken to 550 K with the new peak at B290 K again appearing. Cooling the sample to 90 K and re-dosing water without further O2 exposure led to an almost identical spectrum. Isotopic studies show that the water which desorbs at B290 K scrambles oxygen from Oad and oxygen from the dosed water, consistent with the proposed mechanism.
An indication of the temperature range at which Oad is formed by O2 dissociation can be obtained by varying the O2 exposure temperature and measuring the area under the B290 K peak in otherwise identical TPD spectra. The peak area decreased slightly between 300375 K and significantly between 530650 K. The sharp decrease above 530 K can be attributed to competition between dissociation of O2 to form Oad and the reoxidation of the surface where oxygen is incorporated into the growing TiO2(110) crystal, a process which will be discussed further in section 4.4. Although there was no change in the B290 K peak area for O2 exposed at 90 K and 300 K, this does not necessarily mean O2 dissociates at the lower temperature because O2 molecules could adsorb molecularly at the lower temperature, then dissociate as the temperature is ramped towards B290 K.
Bikondoa et al.28,65 imaged the dissociation of O2 directly using STM. They ensured that any O2 reaction with Ob-vacs was not convoluted with O2/OHb reactions by removing OHb from an area of the surface by scanning at +3 V. The same area was then imaged before and after exposure to B0.6 L O2 at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 17. Following O2 exposure, the four Ob-vacs indicated in Fig. 17a are replaced with four bright features on nearby bright rows. This indicates that O2 has dissociated in the Ob-vacs, with one O atom filling the vacancy and the other forming Oad on a nearby Ti5c site.
Wendt et al.67 obtained similar results with O2 dosed at 120 K,showing that O2 dissociates in Ob-vacs at least down to 120 K.
Spatial analysis of the Oad positions following dissociation at room temperature reveal B74% of them lie one lattice constant (in the [001] direction) away from the Ob-vac filled,the other B26% being found immediately adjacent and two Fig. 17 Reaction of O2 with Ob-vacs on TiO2(110). (a) 100 A

4.2
Molecular adsorption of O2 A surprising temperature dependence was observed for TiO2(110) surfaces exposed to O2. At 120 K, Henderson et al.96 reported that up to three O2 molecules were adsorbed per Ob-vac. As these surfaces are heated, one O2 per Ob-vac dissociates. The other O2 molecules desorb molecularly at B410 K. As the adsorption temperature is increased, the amount of O2 desorbed in the B410 K state is reduced until the state disappears at an adsorption temperature of 180 K. It was therefore concluded that at Z 180 K, no molecular O2 adsorbs. After TPD to 435 K, re-exposing the surface to O2 at 120 K does not revive the B410 K O2 peak in TPD. Hender- son et al.96 conclude that whilst the additional molecularly adsorbed O2 may not adsorb directly in the Ob-vac, they adsorb in sites somehow associated with them, such as in adjacent sites.
Alongside this rich thermal chemistry, a series of photoreac- tion and photodesorption experiments have been per- formed.90,97101 Lu et al.97 found two molecular chemisorption states for O2 which were denoted as a and b states. Upon UV irradiation, the a state photo-oxidises CO whereas the b state undergoes fast photodesorption. When O2 is adsorbed at a temperature of B105 K, the a state dominates.
Annealing above B200 K converts the a state to the b state.
Above B300 K, the a state is no longer present and the b state disappears above B400 K. As with the thermal experiments,these molecular O2 states were linked to Ob-vacs. This was based on their maximum saturation density (0.12 ML) which compared well with typical estimates of the Ob-vac density.89 Further experiments led to the a state being resolved into two states (a1 and a2) with different photodesorption cross- sections.98 However, very recently, Thompson and Yates have proposed that rather than the existence of multiple O2 species,the desorption rate of O2 follows a fractal rate law,102 whereby the rate constant varies with the time of the reaction and is therefore more correctly described as a rate coefficient.99,101 By irradiating a TiO2(110) surface exposed to O2 at B115 K with UV light prior to performing TPD measurements, Perkins and Henderson showed that the B410 K O2 TPD peak depletes.90 Because the a2 state was reported to dominate at such a low temperature and because the cross-section for depletion of the B410 K TPD peak is close to that reported for photodesorption of the a2 state, Perkins and Henderson assigned the B410 K state to a2 O2. However, Thompson and Yates disagree with this assignment, based on the observation that the a states already convert to the b states at 300 K, which themselves dissociate by B400 K.100 Hence, the connection between these thermally and optically activated O2 molecules is still open to debate. Nevertheless, both sets of experiments point to molecular adsorption of O2 at low temperatures provided that Ob-vacs are present. However, in contrast to this, Wendt et al. suggest that some minority sites apart from Ob-vacs must be responsible for the molecular adsorption of O2 because they find that even at 120 K, O2 dissociates to form Oad.67
4.3
O2 and water reactions In section 4.1, we described how water reacts with a TiO2(110) surface pre-exposed to O2. Here, the order of adsorption is reversed and the effect of dosing O2 on a surface pre-exposed to water is examined.34 Water TPD spectra recorded from a hydroxylated TiO2(110) surface exposed to O2 gives rise to a new peak at B300320 K which intensifies at the expense of the B520 K peak when the O2 exposure is increased. The B520 K peak corresponds to the OHb recombinative peak at B490 K in section 3.1, the recorded temperatures of the TPD peaks being systematically offset from the earlier work. Simi- larly, the B300320 K peak corresponds to the B290 K OHt recombinative peak found when a TiO2(110) surface with Oad is exposed to water (section 4.1).
By isotopically labelling the O2, it was shown that the water which desorbs at B300320 K always comes from the dosed O2 and not from lattice O. This means that O2 must abstract hydrogen from OHb presumably to form OHt. H2O2 and/or O2H were speculatively suggested as intermediate species before conversion to OHt, with subsequent calculations show- ing that H2O2 is particularly stable.103
4.4
Reoxidation of non-stoichiometric TiO2(110) As far back at the 1960s, it has been known that TiO2 surfaces are reduced during ion sputtering and that the stoichiometry is restored during annealing, even in UHV. There had been an assumption in the literature that this stoichiometry is restored by diffusion of oxygen from the bulk to the surface. However,in the past decade or so, there has been a growing body of work which supports the idea that stoichiometry is also restored by the diffusion of reduced Tin+ interstitial ions back into the bulk.104,105 By annealing TiO2(110) samples in pres- sures of O2, the reoxidation of these interstitial ions has been stunningly captured in a series of high temperature STM and low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) experiments.
Onishi and Iwasawa were the first to image this reoxidation process directly. They recorded STM images of the TiO2(110) surface reacting with O2 (1107 mbar) over a period of about 40 min. 12 rows were observed growing out from 11 terraces, leading to the conclusion that interstitial Tin+ ions react with O2 at the surface to form added Ti2O3 rows.41 This reoxidation process has been studied in more detail with a series of high resolution STM movies by Bowker et al.51,106108 and Bennett.109 The movies can be viewed via refs. 106 and 109. Both the simple 12 and x-linked 12 rows were observed to reoxidise, although the x-linked 12 was found to be more reactive to oxygen.51 Fig. 18 shows a sequence of STM images recorded at 673 K and B4  107 mbar O2, starting with an image of x-linked
12. As the reaction progresses, the density of x-links in-
creases until they fill in the gaps between the 12 rows and small 11 patches are formed (Fig. 18c). Continued reaction with O2 leads to the coalescence of the 11 patches until 2338  Chem. Soc.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online almost none of the original 12 terrace remains (Fig. 18e),whereupon 12 rows grow on top of the 11 surface and the 12 - 11 - 12 cycle continues.
The same cyclic growth can be seen on a much larger scale in the series of LEEM images shown in Fig. 19, which were recorded at 820 K and 1.3  106 mbar O2.110 The images in Fig. 19 are set so that the dark areas correspond to the 12 phase and the bright areas the 11 phase. At the start of the experiment, the surface has a 11 termination (Fig. 19a). The surface has switched to a 12 phase in Fig. 19b. In Fig. 19c,11 areas have nucleated on the 12 surface, almost filling the surface in Fig. 19d, whereupon the 11 - 12 - 11 - 12 cycle continues.
While both the STM and LEEM sequences show the basic reoxidation reaction, exploration of the parameter space reveals subtle differences in the reaction depending on the temperature and pressure. Most notably, both the STM and LEEM experiments reveal a competition between growth out of the surface (layer-by-layer) and growth of the surface laterally (step-flow) with step-flow dominating at higher tem- peratures. Step-flow is shown clearly in Fig. 20. At intermedi- ate temperatures, a mixed growth mode occurs whereby the larger terraces grow in the layer-by-layer fashion and the smaller terraces grow by step-flow until they reach a critical size. At the critical size, layer-by-layer growth begins.110 At low temperatures (o573 K at 1  107 mbar O2 in ref. 106) and high temperatures (41023 K in 1.3  106 mbar O2 in ref. 110) little or no reactivity was observed. For low tempera- tures, this is presumably because the thermal energy supplied Fig. 20 Two (500 A )2 frames from movie 3 of ref. 106 recorded at 773 K in B1  107 mbar O2. The STM image in (a) was taken 400 s before that in (b). A dotted white line traces the edge of a 11 step edge. The white line is superimposed on the image in (b) showing clearly that the step edge has grown away from the previous boundary.

Published on 04 September 2008 on http://pubs.rsc.org  doi:10.1039/B719085A View Article Online is insufficient to overcome the barriers to reaction, whereas at high temperatures the surface growth is limited by the low residency time of the O2 molecules at the surface. With the data available, it is not yet possible to form a useful phase diagram for the growth modes. Whilst McCarty varied the O2 pressure around 1.3  106 mbar to establish qualitatively that the transition temperature between layer-by-layer/mixed/pure step-flow increases with O2 pressure, this has not been re- corded quantitatively. More difficult will be accounting for the Ti interstitial concentration between different crystals. So far,this has largely been done simply by noting the colour of the crystal. One way in which the Ti interstitial density could be quantified is by measuring the resistivity of the crystal.38 Li et al.38,111113 performed a series of studies somewhat different to the previous ones in that the samples are reoxidised in O2 (B1  106 mbar), then imaged at room temperature without O2 present. A new surface morphology was found consisting of a pseudo-hexagonal network. The structure was assigned to an incomplete 11 layer which forms on top of the normal 11 termination. It was termed a rosette network and forms at B470660 K. The rosettes are reminiscent of the 12 x-links and it is likely that at least parts of a spongy surface formed by Stone et al.106 at B573 K have the same structure.
Importantly, Li et al.112 have also reoxidised their crystals with 18O2 and detected 18O incorporation at the surfaces,finding a maximum rate for 18O incorporation at B669 K.
Li et al. also found 18O uptake to be faster for more reduced crystals (as judged qualitatively from their colour).112 This indicates that the growth rate is dependent on the concentra- tion of Tin+ interstitials. A similar reaction dependence was also observed by McCarty,110 and was one of the reasons suggested for the different activation energies for reoxidation calculated by Smith et al.108 (B25 kJ mol1) from extended sequences of STM images and by Li et al.112 (B80 kJ mol1) from 18O uptake measurements.

Carboxylic acids Given the importance of carboxyl containing molecules in a variety of TiO2-based applications (e.g. Gra tzel-type solar cells), it is hardly surprising that there is a large archive of fundamental studies on the interaction of carboxylic acids with TiO2(110). Effort has largely focused on adsorption on the 11 phase, although there are also studies of the chemistry on the 12 reconstruction.
In this section, the chemistry of the simplest carboxylic acid,namely formic acid, is first discussed, covering both initial adsorption and subsequent decomposition. Then we move onto other carboxylic acids, discussing their adsorption, ther- mal decomposition, and finally photodecomposition.
