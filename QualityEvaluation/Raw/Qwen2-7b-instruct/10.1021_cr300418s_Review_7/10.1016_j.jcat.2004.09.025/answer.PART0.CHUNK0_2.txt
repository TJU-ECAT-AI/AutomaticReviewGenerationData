[1] "Catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas was studied over ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ containing oxide contaminations in a wide temperature window."
[2] "Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance."
[3] "The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance."
[4] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[5] "More active sites are created per square meter after calcination at higher temperatures."
[6] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse."
[7] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."
[8] "The catalytic performance of YSZ can be improved by a rise in the reaction temperature to 950 C and above, due to dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse watergas shift reactions."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of reactive oxygen species on the oxide surface. Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in this process, as they can provide sites for the adsorption and activation of oxygen. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it affects the availability and stability of these reactive sites.

2. Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance. This enhancement likely stems from the creation of additional reactive oxygen species and/or the modification of the electronic structure of the oxide surface, which facilitates the oxidation of methane.

3. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface to activate oxygen, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species. These species can then facilitate the oxidation of substrates, such as methane, by providing an electron-rich environment that promotes the formation of reactive oxygen intermediates.

4. The composition of the outermost surface of YSZ determines its catalytic performance, rather than the bulk composition. This is because the outermost surface is where the interactions with the reactants and products occur, influencing the catalytic activity and selectivity.

5. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by generating reactive oxygen species on the oxide surface, which can then participate in the oxidation of substrates like methane. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it affects the availability and stability of these reactive sites.

6. Calcination at higher temperatures enhances the catalytic performance of YSZ by creating more active sites per square meter. This improvement is likely due to the increased surface area available for catalytic reactions, which allows for more efficient interaction with the reactants.

7. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by generating reactive oxygen species on the oxide surface, which can then participate in the oxidation of substrates like methane. The concurrent occurrence of heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950°C indicates that the mechanism involves both surface interactions and gas-phase reactions.

8. Raising the reaction temperature to 950°C and above can improve the catalytic performance of YSZ, due to the activation of various reforming reactions. These include dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse water-gas shift reaction, which contribute to the conversion of methane to synthesis gas.
