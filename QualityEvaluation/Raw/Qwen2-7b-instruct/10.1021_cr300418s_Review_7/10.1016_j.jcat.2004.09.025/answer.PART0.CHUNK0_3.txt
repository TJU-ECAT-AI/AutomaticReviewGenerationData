[4] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."

1. Catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas was studied across a broad temperature range on ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ with oxide contaminants.
2. Adding Y2O3 to ZrO2 creates active sites, enhancing its catalytic efficiency.
3. The surface composition, rather than the bulk composition, dictates the catalytic performance of YSZ.
4. The outermost surface of calcined YSZ always contains 12 to 2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3, irrespective of the bulk Y2O3 concentration or calcination temperature, provided the catalyst is not contaminated.
5. Higher temperatures lead to the creation of more active sites per unit area.
6. Sintering reduces the activity of YSZ with traces of alkali oxides by causing the catalyst to lose surface area.
7. At temperatures above 950°C, both heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions occur simultaneously during methane oxidation over YSZ.
8. Boosting the reaction temperature to 950°C and beyond enhances YSZ's catalytic performance, facilitated by dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse watergas shift reactions.

1. 对甲烷在宽温度范围内的部分氧化以合成气为研究对象，涉及了氧化锆、纯YSZ以及含有氧化物杂质的YSZ。
2. 在氧化锆中添加Y2O3可以生成活性位点，从而提高其催化性能。
3. YSZ的表面组成而非整体组成决定了它的催化性能。
4. 烧结后的YSZ表面始终包含12到2摩尔%的Y2O3，这是由于Y2O3的分层导致的，不论是在基体中的Y2O3浓度还是烧结温度，只要催化剂不受污染。
5. 温度升高使得每平方米面积上的活性位点数量增加。
6. 粘合剂导致含土碱氧化物的YSZ活动性下降，这是由于催化剂的表面积随时间流失。
7. 当温度高于950°C时，在YSZ上进行甲烷氧化反应时，同时发生异相和均相反应。
8. 将反应温度提升至950°C及以上，通过干重整、蒸汽重整和逆水煤气变换反应，可以增强YSZ的催化性能。
