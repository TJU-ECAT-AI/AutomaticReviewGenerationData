1. The catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas has been a subject of study for nearly two decades. Transition metals such as Ni, Co, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt have been identified as active catalysts for this process.
2. Mixed metal oxides like NiOMgO, NiBaTiO3, NiMgCrLaO, and Ca0.8Sr0.2Ti0.2Ni0.2 have been reported to be highly active and selective catalysts for partial oxidation of methane at high space velocities and temperatures.
3. Selective partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas is commonly noted as a significant side reaction in oxidative coupling of methane over rare oxides and partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde on titania.
4. In laboratory studies, CPOM was conducted over metal oxides such as TiO2, La2O3, and ZrO2-based mixed oxides.
5. Among the oxide catalysts, yttrium-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) demonstrated the best catalytic performance.
6. Increasing the calcination temperature leads to the creation of more active sites per unit area on the catalyst, while the surface area of the catalyst diminishes via sintering.
7. It is uncertain whether enhanced segregation of Y2O3 contributes to the observed effects.
8. Selective partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas is frequently cited as a notable side reaction in oxidative coupling of methane over rare oxides and partial oxidation of methane to formaldehyde on titania.
9. The reforming reactions of methane during the process of partial oxidation contribute significantly to the selectivity of synthesis gas, despite the catalyst's insufficient activity to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium.
