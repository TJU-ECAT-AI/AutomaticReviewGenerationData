[1] "Catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas was studied over ZrO2, pure YSZ, and YSZ containing oxide contaminations in a wide temperature window."
[2] "Doping ZrO2 with Y2O3 generates active sites, resulting in improved catalytic performance."
[3] "The composition of the outermost surface rather than the bulk of YSZ clearly determines its catalytic performance."
[4] "The composition of the outermost surface of calcined YSZ is independent of both the concentration of Y2O3 in the bulk and the calcination temperature as long as the YSZ catalyst is not contaminated; the surface always contains 12  2 mol% Y2O3 due to segregation of Y2O3."
[5] "More active sites are created per square meter after calcination at higher temperatures."
[6] "Sintering causes the activity of YSZ containing traces of (earth) alkali oxides to collapse."
[7] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with ho- mogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."
[8] "The catalytic performance of YSZ can be improved by a rise in the reaction temperature to 950 C and above, due to dry reforming, steam reforming, and the reverse watergas shift reactions."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by facilitating the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface, which in turn determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface.
2. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface, as it affects the reactivity of the surface and the ease with which reactions can proceed.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过促进氧化物表面氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来操作，这反过来决定了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
2. 形成氧空位所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要，因为它影响表面的反应性和反应进行的容易程度。
