[1] "The catalytic performance of YSZ catalysts is strongly influenced by the surface composition."
[2] "The surface of the YSZ12 catalysts is significantly contaminated with oxides, mainly CaO, as detected by LEIS."
[3] "Calcination at high temperature results in high coverage of impurities on the surface."
[4] "Heterogeneous reactions occur concurrently with homogeneous reactions at temperatures above 950 C during CPOM over YSZ."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
1. The catalytic performance of YSZ catalysts is significantly determined by the composition of their outermost surface rather than the bulk composition.
2. The surface of YSZ12 catalysts is notably contaminated with oxides, primarily calcium oxide (CaO), as identified through low-energy ion scattering (LEIS).
3. Heating at high temperatures leads to a substantial increase in impurities covering the surface of the catalyst.
4. At temperatures exceeding 950°C, partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas over YSZ involves concurrent heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions.

1. YSZ催化剂的催化性能主要由其外表面的组成决定，而不是整体组成。
2. YSZ12催化剂的表面显著被氧化物污染，主要是钙氧化物（CaO），通过低能离子散射（LEIS）检测到。
3. 高温加热导致表面杂质覆盖量显著增加。
4. 在温度超过950°C时，甲烷在YSZ上的部分氧化至合成气涉及同时进行的异相和均相反应。
