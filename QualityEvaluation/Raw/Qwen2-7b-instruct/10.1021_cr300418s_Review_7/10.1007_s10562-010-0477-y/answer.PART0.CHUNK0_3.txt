[1] "Such correlations provide an easy way of establishing trends in reactivity among the different transition metals."
[2] "All calculations were performed using the DACAPO plane-wave pseudo potential DFT code [13]."
[3] "A (1 × 2) cell with 10 atomic layers in the (211) direction corresponding to three layers in the close-packed (111) direction was used to model the adsorbatemetal structures."
[4] "Equation 3 shows the linear BEP relation, where γ is the slope and ξ is the intercept of the linear relationship between the transition state energies and the reaction energies."
[5] "As expected, the slopes are very close to but slightly smaller than one for most reactions."
[6] "The universal BEP relation is useful for establishing overall trends of dissociation reactions in a zeroth order approximation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. By facilitating the creation and movement of oxygen vacancies, the mechanism enhances the surface's capability to participate in oxidation processes, thereby affecting the reaction's efficiency and selectivity.
