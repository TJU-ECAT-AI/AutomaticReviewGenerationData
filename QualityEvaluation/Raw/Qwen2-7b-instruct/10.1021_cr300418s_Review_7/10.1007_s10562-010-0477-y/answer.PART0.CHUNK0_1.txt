The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because the stability and availability of these oxygen vacancies influence the reaction pathways and the activation energies of the oxidation process. Higher ΔEv leads to increased stability of the oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This mechanism allows for efficient oxygen transfer and activation, facilitating the oxidation reactions on the surface of the oxide catalyst.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧空位（ΔEv）的形成来运作。氧空位形成的能量对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力具有重要意义。这是因为这些氧空位的稳定性和可用性影响反应途径和氧化过程的活化能。较高的ΔEv导致氧空位的稳定性增加，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。这一机制允许高效地进行氧气传输和激活，促进氧化物催化剂表面的氧化反应。
