[1] "For a dissociation reaction (AB → A + B), the transition state energy (E_{ts}) is calculated by Eq. 1, in which E_{ts/slab}, E_{slab}, and E_{gas} are the total energies of the slab with transition states, the clean slab, and the gas phase molecules relevant for the reactions, respectively."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption energy (ΔE_{diss}) is calculated by Eq. 2 in which E_{A/slab} and E_{B/slab} are the total energies of the slab with adsorbates A and B, respectively."
[3] "All calculations were performed using the DACAPO plane-wave pseudo potential DFT code [13]."
[4] "Equation 3 shows the linear BEP relation, where γ is the slope and ξ is the intercept of the linear relationship between the transition state energies and the reaction energies."
[5] "As expected, the slopes are very close to but slightly smaller than one for most reactions."
[6] "The universal BEP relation is useful for establishing overall trends of dissociation reactions in a zeroth order approximation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the document, the dissociative adsorption energy (ΔE_{diss}) and transition state energy (E_{ts}) are calculated using equations (1) and (2), respectively. These calculations are performed using the DACAPO plane-wave pseudo potential DFT code. The linear BEP relation (Eq. 3) shows that the slope (γ) and intercept (ξ) parameters are close to but slightly smaller than one for most reactions, indicating a close similarity between the transition state and final state geometries. This universal BEP relation helps establish overall trends in dissociation reactions, aiding in the understanding of catalytic reactions and their intrinsic activity and selectivity across various transition-metal surfaces.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来运作。这一能量在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。根据文档，解离吸附能（ΔE_{diss}）和过渡态能量（E_{ts}）分别通过等式（1）和（2）进行计算。这些计算使用DACAPO平面波伪势DFT代码完成。线性BEP关系（等式3）显示，大多数反应的斜率（γ）和截距（ξ）参数接近但略小于1，表明过渡状态和最终状态几何形状之间的相似性。这种通用的BEP关系有助于确定解离反应的整体趋势，帮助理解催化反应及其在各种过渡金属表面的内在活性和选择性的内在性质。
