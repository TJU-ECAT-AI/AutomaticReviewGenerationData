[1] "For a dissociation reaction (AB → A + B), the transition state energy (E_{ts}) is calculated by Eq. 1, in which E_{ts/slab}, E_{slab}, and E_{gas} are the total energies of the slab with transition states, the clean slab, and the gas phase molecules relevant for the reactions, respectively."
[2] "The dissociative adsorption energy (ΔE_{diss}) is calculated by Eq. 2 in which E_{A/slab} and E_{B/slab} are the total energies of the slab with adsorbates A and B, respectively."
[3] "All calculations were performed using the DACAPO plane-wave pseudo potential DFT code [13]."
[4] "Equation 3 shows the linear BEP relation, where γ is the slope and ξ is the intercept of the linear relationship between the transition state energies and the reaction energies."
[5] "As expected, the slopes are very close to but slightly smaller than one for most reactions."
[6] "The universal BEP relation is useful for establishing overall trends of dissociation reactions in a zeroth order approximation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the document, the dissociative adsorption energy (ΔE_{diss}) and transition state energy (E_{ts}) are calculated using equations (1) and (2), respectively. These calculations are performed using the DACAPO plane-wave pseudo potential DFT code. The linear BEP relation (Eq. 3) shows that the slope (γ) and intercept (ξ) parameters are close to but slightly smaller than one for most reactions, indicating a close similarity between the transition state and final state geometries. This universal BEP relation helps establish overall trends in dissociation reactions, aiding in the understanding of catalytic reactions and their intrinsic activity and selectivity across various transition-metal surfaces.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. This is because the stability and availability of these oxygen vacancies influence the reaction pathways and the activation energies of the oxidation process. Higher ΔEv leads to increased stability of the oxygen vacancies, which in turn enhances the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. This mechanism allows for efficient oxygen transfer and activation, facilitating the oxidation reactions on the surface of the oxide catalyst.
