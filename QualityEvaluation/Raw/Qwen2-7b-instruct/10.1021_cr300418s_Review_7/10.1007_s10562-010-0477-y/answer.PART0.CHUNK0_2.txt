[1] "Such correlations provide an easy way of establishing trends in reactivity among the different transition metals."
[2] "All calculations were performed using the DACAPO plane-wave pseudo potential DFT code [13]."
[3] "A closer inspection of the γ and ξ parameters for the dissociation reactions, as shown in Table 1, therefore reveals that there are differences between the reactions considered here."
[4] "The universal BEP relation is useful for establishing overall trends of dissociation reactions in a zeroth order approximation."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv typically indicates a more active surface, capable of promoting oxidation reactions more efficiently. This mechanism explains how the surface chemistry and energetics determine the performance of oxide catalysts in oxidation processes.
