[1] "Such correlations provide an easy way of establishing trends in reactivity among the different transition metals."
[2] "All calculations were performed using the DACAPO plane-wave pseudo potential DFT code [13]."
[3] "A (1 × 2) cell with 10 atomic layers in the (211) direction corresponding to three layers in the close-packed (111) direction was used to model the adsorbatemetal structures."
[4] "Equation 3 shows the linear BEP relation, where γ is the slope and ξ is the intercept of the linear relationship between the transition state energies and the reaction energies."
[5] "As expected, the slopes are very close to but slightly smaller than one for most reactions."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv). This energy plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The ΔEv influences how efficiently the oxygen vacancies can facilitate the oxidation process, thereby affecting the reaction's efficiency and selectivity.
