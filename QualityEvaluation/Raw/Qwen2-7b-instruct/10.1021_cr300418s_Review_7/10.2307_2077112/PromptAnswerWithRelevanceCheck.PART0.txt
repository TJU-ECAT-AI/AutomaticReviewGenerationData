Read the questions and answers provided below. First, critically assess the overall relevance of the answers provided to the set of questions asked.

If, upon your assessment, you find that the answers do not contain information that is relevant to the questions asked, stop your review process immediately and respond with a single sentence: "※※※※※※※The provided answers are not relevant to the questions.※※※※※※※". Do not provide any additional explanation or background information, only this sentence should be given as a response in case of irrelevant answers.

If, however, the answers are relevant to the questions asked, proceed to compile answers for each question according to the instructions below. Ensure to aggregate all the relevant answers from the multiple answer results provided in the document, and organize them sequentially by their order number, compiling the corresponding quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question.

If the provided answers' quotes are not differentiated by question, ensure to break them down and assign the quotes to each respective question, outputting them separately within each question's section.

To provide a comprehensive review, differentiate the responses into quotes, English answers, and Chinese answers for each question based on the details given in the 'Answer' XML tags. Structure your review using the XML format showcased below if the answers are relevant to the questions asked:

<quotes>
[1] "Some nineteenth- century novels do indeed raise the issue of women's careers-for example, George Gissing's The Odd Women, or Geraldine Jews- bury's The Half Sisters. Kane has missed them, but her point remains valid: Female professionals are nearly absent from the Victorian imaginary world."
[2] "Families of two or three children appear to have been the norm throughout the century, and not only because mortality reduced the number of surviving children. There is, typically, an undertone of disap- proval when large broods are mentioned."

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位（O空位）的形成来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。当ΔEv较低时，它有利于形成氧空位，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
