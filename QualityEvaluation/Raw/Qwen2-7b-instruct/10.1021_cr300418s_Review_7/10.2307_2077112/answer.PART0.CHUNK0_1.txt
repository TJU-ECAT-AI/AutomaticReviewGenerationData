[1] "Some nineteenth- century novels do indeed raise the issue of women's careers-for example, George Gissing's The Odd Women, or Geraldine Jews- bury's The Half Sisters. Kane has missed them, but her point remains valid: Female professionals are nearly absent from the Victorian imaginary world."
[2] "Families of two or three children appear to have been the norm throughout the century, and not only because mortality reduced the number of surviving children. There is, typically, an undertone of disap- proval when large broods are mentioned."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by involving the formation of oxygen vacancies (O vacancies) on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, it facilitates the formation of oxygen vacancies, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface.

火星-范克雷伦机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过涉及氧化物催化剂表面的氧空位（O空位）的形成来运作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。当ΔEv较低时，它有利于形成氧空位，从而增强氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。
