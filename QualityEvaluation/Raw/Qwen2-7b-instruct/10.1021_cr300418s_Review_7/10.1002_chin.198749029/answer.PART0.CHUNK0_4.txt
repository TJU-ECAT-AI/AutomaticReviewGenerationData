[1] "After impregnation, the support consists of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide."
[2] "Reduction at 623 K yields Rh/LaO(OH)."
[3] "A reduction temp. of 723 K is necessary to obtain the Rh/La2O3 catalyst."
[4] "In contrast to the dehydration of the support, the reduction of the carbonated phase is strongly activated by the presence of Rh."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface during the oxidation reaction. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. According to the literature, reducing the carbonated phase of the support is significantly influenced by the presence of Rh, contrasting with the dehydration process of the support.
