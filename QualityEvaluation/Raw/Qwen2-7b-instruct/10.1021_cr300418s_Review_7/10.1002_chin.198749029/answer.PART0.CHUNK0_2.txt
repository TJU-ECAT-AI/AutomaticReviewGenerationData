[1] "After impregnation, the support consists of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide."
[2] "Reduction at 623 K yields Rh/LaO(OH)."
[3] "A reduction temp. of 723 K is necessary to obtain the Rh/La2O3 catalyst."
[4] "In contrast to the dehydration of the support, the reduction of the carbonated phase is strongly activated by the presence of Rh."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface.
2. The document does not explicitly state the significance of ΔEv in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. However, based on the information provided, the presence of Rh activates the reduction of the carbonated phase more strongly than the dehydration of the support, indicating an influence of ΔEv on the reaction kinetics.

1. Mars-van Krevelen机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过氧化物表面的氧空位（ΔEv）进行操作。形成氧空位所需的能量在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力方面起着关键作用。
2. 文档没有明确指出ΔEv在决定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力时的重要性。然而，根据提供的信息，Rh的存在显著激活了碳化相的还原过程，而不是支持物的脱水过程，这表明ΔEv对反应动力学的影响。
