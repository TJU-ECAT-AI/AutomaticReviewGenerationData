[1] "After impregnation, the support consists of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide."
[2] "Reduction at 623 K yields Rh/LaO(OH)."
[3] "A reduction temp. of 723 K is necessary to obtain the Rh/La2O3 catalyst."
[4] "In contrast to the dehydration of the support, the reduction of the carbonated phase is strongly activated by the presence of Rh."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) to activate the reaction. This energy determines both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. The presence of Rh activates the reduction of the carbonated phase during the preparation of the catalyst, which contrasts with the dehydration of the support.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）来激活反应。这一能量决定了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。Rh的存在促进了催化剂制备过程中碳化物相的还原，这与支持体的脱水形成鲜明对比。
