After impregnation, the support consists of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide.
Reduction at 623 K yields Rh/LaO(OH).
A reduction temp. of 723 K is necessary to obtain the Rh/La2O3 catalyst.
In contrast to the dehydration of the support, the reduction of the carbonated phase is strongly activated by the presence of Rh.

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface, which significantly affects both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) determines the ease with which these vacancies can be created, impacting how efficiently the oxide can catalyze oxidation reactions. In the context of the document, the reduction process at specific temperatures (623 K and 723 K) facilitates the transformation of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide into Rh/LaO(OH) and Rh/La2O3 catalysts, respectively. The presence of Rh activates the reduction of the carbonated phase, indicating its role in enhancing the catalytic properties of the oxide support.

火星-范克雷伦机制通过在氧化物表面形成氧空位来运行，这显著影响了氧化物的催化活性和氧化能力。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）决定了空位可以被创建的难易程度，从而影响氧化物如何有效地催化氧化反应。在文档的背景下，623 K 和 723 K 的还原过程分别促进了部分碳化的镧氢氧化物转化为Rh/LaO(OH)和Rh/La2O3催化剂。Rh的存在激活了碳化相的还原，表明它在增强氧化物支撑材料的催化性质中的作用。
