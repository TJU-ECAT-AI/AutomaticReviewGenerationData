[1] "After impregnation, the support consists of partially carbonated lanthanum hydroxide."
[2] "Reduction at 623 K yields Rh/LaO(OH)."
[3] "A reduction temp. of 723 K is necessary to obtain the Rh/La2O3 catalyst."
[4] "In contrast to the dehydration of the support, the reduction of the carbonated phase is strongly activated by the presence of Rh."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A higher ΔEv typically leads to a more stable surface, which can result in lower reactivity and potentially lower catalytic efficiency. Conversely, a lower ΔEv might facilitate faster oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. However, this balance is crucial as too much oxygen vacancy formation could lead to surface instability, reducing the catalyst's performance over time.

火星-范克雷文机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物催化剂表面形成氧空位进行操作。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力有显著影响。较高的ΔEv通常会导致更稳定的表面，这可能导致较低的活性和潜在的较低催化效率。相反，较低的ΔEv可能有助于更快地形成氧空位，增强表面的催化活性和氧化能力。然而，这种平衡至关重要，因为过多的氧空位形成可能会导致表面不稳定，从而降低催化剂的性能随时间减少。
