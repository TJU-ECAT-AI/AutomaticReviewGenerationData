[1] "We study the effect of gold doping on oxygen vacancy formation and CO adsorption on the (110) and (100) surfaces of ceria by using density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U)."
[2] "The energy required to form a second vacancy is smaller on (110) than on (100)."
[3] "Thus doping makes the (110) surface a better oxidant but it has a small effect on the oxidative power of the (100) surface."
[4] "On the (110) surface CO adsorption results in formation of a carbonate-like structure, similar to the undoped surface, while on the (100) surface direct formation of CO2 is observed, in contrast to the undoped surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the breaking of a chemical bond to facilitate the formation of a reactive species that can then participate in subsequent oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of oxygen vacancies is energetically favorable, which enhances the surface's ability to take oxygen from the gas phase. This, in turn, increases the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. On the (110) surface, the lower energy required for forming a second oxygen vacancy compared to the (100) surface makes the (110) surface a better oxidant. Additionally, CO adsorption on the (110) surface results in a carbonate-like structure, while on the (100) surface, direct formation of CO2 is observed, highlighting the surface-specific effects of gold doping on the catalytic behavior of ceria surfaces.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用断裂化学键时释放的能量来促进形成活性物种，该物种随后可以参与后续氧化反应。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位的形成是能量有利的，这增强了表面从气相获取氧气的能力。这反过来增加了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。对于(110)表面，形成第二个氧空位所需的能量低于(100)表面，使得(110)表面成为更好的氧化剂。此外，CO吸附在(110)表面上导致碳酸盐结构的形成，而在(100)表面上直接形成CO2，突出了金掺杂对铈表面催化行为的表面特异性影响。
