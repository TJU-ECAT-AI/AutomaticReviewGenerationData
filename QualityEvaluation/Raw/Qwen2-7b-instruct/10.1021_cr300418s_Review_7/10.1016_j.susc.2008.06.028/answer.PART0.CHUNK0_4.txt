[1] "In this paper, we use density functional theory corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U) to study the effect of doping the (110) and (100) surfaces with Au on oxygen vacancy formation and on CO adsorption."
[2] "The energy required to form a second vacancy is smaller on (110) than on (100)."
[3] "On the (110) surface, it is much easier to form a second vacancy on the doped surface than the first vacancy on the undoped surface."
[4] "The energy required to form a second oxygen vacancy on (100) is comparable to that of forming the first vacancy on the undoped surface."
[5] "Thus, doping makes the (110) surface a better oxidant but it has a small effect on the oxidative power of the (100) surface."
[6] "The Au dopant weakens the bond of the surrounding oxygen atoms to the oxide making it a better oxidant, facilitating CO oxidation."
[7] "On the (110) surface CO adsorption results in formation of a carbonate-like structure, similar to the undoped surface, while on the (100) surface direct formation of CO2 is observed."
[8] "We find that doping is a favourable approach to enhancing the oxidation process."

1. Doping affects the energy required for oxygen vacancy formation on the (110) and (100) surfaces. Specifically, it decreases the energy needed to form a second vacancy on the (110) surface compared to the (100) surface. This makes the (110) surface a better oxidant. 

2. The Au dopant weakens the bond between the surrounding oxygen atoms and the oxide, thereby facilitating CO oxidation.

3. CO adsorption on the (110) surface forms a carbonate-like structure, while on the (100) surface, it directly forms CO2. 

4. Doping enhances the interaction of CO with the surface, making carbonate formation more favorable on the (110) surface and directly forming CO2 on the (100) surface.

1. 氧化物表面的（110）和（100）面的掺杂影响了氧空位形成所需的能量。具体来说，它降低了在（110）面上形成第二个空位所需的能量与（100）面上形成第一个空位所需的能量相比。这使得（110）表面成为更好的氧化剂。

2. Au掺杂物削弱了周围氧原子与氧化物之间的键，从而促进了CO氧化。

3. CO吸附在（110）表面上形成类似于未掺杂表面的碳酸盐结构，而在（100）表面上直接形成CO2。

4. 掺杂增强了CO与表面的相互作用，使碳酸盐在（110）表面上形成更有利于直接在（100）表面上形成CO2。
