[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the sequential addition of oxygen atoms to the reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a significant role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."
[2] "Upon doping with Au, the oxygen vacancy formation energy is negative, indicating that if the system is in equilibrium, oxygen vacancies will be thermodynamically favourable."
[3] "For CO adsorption, doping enhances the interaction of the molecule with the surface, making carbonate formation on (110) more favourable and facilitating direct formation of CO2 at the (100) surface."

1. The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the sequential addition of oxygen atoms to the reactant molecule. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is crucial in assessing the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.
2. Gold doping on ceria surfaces leads to a negative oxygen vacancy formation energy, suggesting that under equilibrium conditions, oxygen vacancies are thermodynamically favorable.
3. Doping improves the interaction between CO molecules and the surface, promoting carbonate formation on the (110) surface and direct CO2 formation on the (100) surface.
