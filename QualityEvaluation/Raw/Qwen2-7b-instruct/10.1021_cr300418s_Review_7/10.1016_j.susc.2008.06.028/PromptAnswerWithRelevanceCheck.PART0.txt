[1] "We study the effect of gold doping on oxygen vacancy formation and CO adsorption on the (110) and (100) surfaces of ceria by using density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U)."

[3] "The presence of the dopant lowers dramatically the energy for oxygen vacancy formation on these surfaces."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and recombination of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the oxide surface becomes more prone to oxygen vacancy formation, which facilitates the oxidation reaction by providing a site for the reaction to occur. This makes the surface more active in oxidation reactions. Conversely, a high ΔEv reduces the likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, decreasing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. The presence of gold doping lowers the ΔEv, enhancing the oxidative power of the ceria surfaces. The temperature window in which the surface provides a single oxygen atom per dopant further increases the probability of the oxide being a selective oxidation catalyst.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成和重组氧空位起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧化物表面更易于形成氧空位，这通过提供反应发生的位置来促进氧化反应，从而使表面的活性增加。相反，较高的ΔEv减少了氧空位形成的可能性，降低了催化剂活性和氧化能力。金掺杂降低了ΔEv，增强了铈氧化物表面的氧化能力。表面提供每个掺杂剂一个氧原子的温度窗口进一步增加了氧化物成为选择性氧化催化剂的可能性。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by utilizing the energy released during the breaking of a chemical bond to facilitate the formation of a reactive species that can then participate in subsequent oxidation reactions. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv indicates that the formation of oxygen vacancies is energetically favorable, which enhances the surface's ability to take oxygen from the gas phase. This, in turn, increases the surface's catalytic activity and oxidizing power. On the (110) surface, the lower energy required for forming a second oxygen vacancy compared to the (100) surface makes the (110) surface a better oxidant. Additionally, CO adsorption on the (110) surface results in a carbonate-like structure, while on the (100) surface, direct formation of CO2 is observed, highlighting the surface-specific effects of gold doping on the catalytic behavior of ceria surfaces.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过利用断裂化学键时释放的能量来促进形成活性物种，该物种随后可以参与后续氧化反应。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv表明氧空位的形成是能量有利的，这增强了表面从气相获取氧气的能力。这反过来增加了表面的催化活性和氧化能力。对于(110)表面，形成第二个氧空位所需的能量低于(100)表面，使得(110)表面成为更好的氧化剂。此外，CO吸附在(110)表面上导致碳酸盐结构的形成，而在(100)表面上直接形成CO2，突出了金掺杂对铈表面催化行为的表面特异性影响。

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps including the formation of an oxygen vacancy, the adsorption of a molecule onto the oxide surface, the interaction of the molecule with the surface to form an intermediate species, and the release of the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is energetically favorable, making the surface more reactive and capable of efficiently engaging in oxidation reactions. This energetic consideration is crucial for the efficiency of the oxidation process, as it affects the ease with which oxygen is removed from the surface and replaced with products.
