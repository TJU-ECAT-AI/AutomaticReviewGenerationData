[1] "We study the effect of gold doping on oxygen vacancy formation and CO adsorption on the (110) and (100) surfaces of ceria by using density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U)."
[2] "The energy required to form a second vacancy is smaller on (110) than on (100)."
[3] "The presence of the dopant lowers dramatically the energy for oxygen vacancy formation on these surfaces."
[4] "Doping results in a temperature window in which the surface provides a single oxygen atom per dopant, so that there is a good probability that a doped oxide will be a good selective oxidation catalyst."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation and recombination of oxygen vacancies on the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. When ΔEv is low, the oxide surface becomes more prone to oxygen vacancy formation, which facilitates the oxidation reaction by providing a site for the reaction to occur. This makes the surface more active in oxidation reactions. Conversely, a high ΔEv reduces the likelihood of oxygen vacancy formation, decreasing the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the surface. The presence of gold doping lowers the ΔEv, enhancing the oxidative power of the ceria surfaces. The temperature window in which the surface provides a single oxygen atom per dopant further increases the probability of the oxide being a selective oxidation catalyst.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过在氧化物表面形成和重组氧空位起作用。氧空位形成所需的能量（ΔEv）对于确定氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。当ΔEv较低时，氧化物表面更易于形成氧空位，这通过提供反应发生的位置来促进氧化反应，从而使表面的活性增加。相反，较高的ΔEv减少了氧空位形成的可能性，降低了催化剂活性和氧化能力。金掺杂降低了ΔEv，增强了铈氧化物表面的氧化能力。表面提供每个掺杂剂一个氧原子的温度窗口进一步增加了氧化物成为选择性氧化催化剂的可能性。
