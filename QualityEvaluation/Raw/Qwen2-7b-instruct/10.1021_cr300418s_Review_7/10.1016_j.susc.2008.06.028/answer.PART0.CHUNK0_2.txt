[1] "We study the effect of gold doping on oxygen vacancy formation and CO adsorption on the (110) and (100) surfaces of ceria by using density functional theory, corrected for on-site Coulomb interactions (DFT + U)."
[2] "The formation of one oxygen vacancy near a dopant atom is energetically downhill while the for- mation of a second vacancy around the same dopant requires energy."
[3] "When the surface is in equilibrium with gaseous oxygen at 1 atm and room temperature there is a 0.4 probability that no oxygen atom left the neighborhood of a dopant."
[4] "On the (110) surface, it is much easier to form a second vacancy on the doped surface than the first vacancy on the undoped surface."
[5] "The energy required to form a second vacancy is smaller on (110) than on (100)."
[6] "On the (110) surface CO adsorption results in formation of a carbonate-like structure, similar to the undoped surface, while on the (100) surface direct formation of CO2 is observed, in contrast to the undoped surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through a series of steps including the formation of an oxygen vacancy, the adsorption of a molecule onto the oxide surface, the interaction of the molecule with the surface to form an intermediate species, and the release of the oxidized product. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is significant because it determines the catalytic activity and oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. Lower ΔEv values indicate that the formation of an oxygen vacancy is energetically favorable, making the surface more reactive and capable of efficiently engaging in oxidation reactions. This energetic consideration is crucial for the efficiency of the oxidation process, as it affects the ease with which oxygen is removed from the surface and replaced with products.

火星-范克雷维尔机制在氧化物催化氧化反应中通过一系列步骤进行操作，包括形成氧空位、分子在氧化物表面吸附、分子与表面相互作用形成中间物种，以及释放氧化产物。氧空位形成所需能量（ΔEv）对于氧化过程的催化活性和氧化能力至关重要。较低的ΔEv值表明氧空位的形成是热力学上有利的，使得表面更具有反应性，并能有效地参与氧化反应。这一能量考虑对于氧化过程的效率至关重要，因为它影响从表面去除氧气并用产物替换的容易程度。
