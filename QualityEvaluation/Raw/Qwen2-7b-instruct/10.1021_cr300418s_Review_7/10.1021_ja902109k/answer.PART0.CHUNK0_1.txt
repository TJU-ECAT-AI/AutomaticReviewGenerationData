The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv). This energy is crucial in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface. A lower ΔEv facilitates easier oxygen vacancy formation, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency.
