<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism plays a crucial role in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions. This mechanism involves the formation of an oxygen vacancy (ΔEv), which is essential for the catalytic activity and oxidizing power of the oxide surface. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation significantly influences these properties.
