[1] "The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions through the formation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst."
[2] "The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) plays a crucial role in determining both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing ability of the oxide surface."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions involves the creation of oxygen vacancies on the surface of the oxide catalyst. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences both the catalytic efficiency and the oxidizing capacity of the oxide surface.
