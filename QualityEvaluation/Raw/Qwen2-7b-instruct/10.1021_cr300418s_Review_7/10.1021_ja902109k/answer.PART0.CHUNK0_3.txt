<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates in oxide-catalyzed oxidation reactions by sequentially involving oxygen adsorption, activation, and reaction. The energy needed for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) significantly influences the catalyst's activity and its ability to oxidize substances on the oxide surface.
