The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involves the initial adsorption of an oxygen species on the catalyst surface, followed by the adsorption of carbon monoxide and its subsequent oxidation to carbon dioxide. The energy required for oxygen vacancy formation (ΔEv) is essential in determining the catalytic activity and oxidizing capability of the oxide surface.
