The trapped-hole center in smoky quartz is formed by a defect electron captured at an oxygen ligand around a substitutional aluminum ion. The hole remains localized at the oxygen ligand due to the high energy barrier for ionizing the aluminum ion. The hopping of the hole among oxygen ligands leads to the disappearance of the electron spin resonance spectrum above 170 K, and it also causes dielectric loss in smoky quartz. The electronic structure of the trapped hole is analyzed using crystal field theory, which effectively explains the experimental g-shift data.

烟水晶中的捕获空穴中心由缺陷电子在替换铝离子周围的氧配体中捕获形成。空穴倾向于保留在氧配体上，因为离子化Al³⁺离子需要超过100 eV的能量。空穴在这些氧配体之间的跃迁导致了电子自旋共振谱在170 K以上消失，并且也在烟水晶中引起了介电损耗。通过晶场理论分析了捕获的空穴的电子结构，有效地解释了实验的g移位数据。
