[1] "In the presence of an electric field F, there will be a further Stark-splitting of the two exchange-split states of our "two-well" system. Eq. (13) should now be generalized to read
E•177
?V-('F)
2" (14)"

[2] "Now, the effective exchange splitting, to be labeled 2?*, turns out to be so small, that the effects resulting from random electric fields, F, which arise from imperfections and crystalline strains present in the piezoelectric host, can no longer be neglected."

1. When an electric field F is present, the two exchange-split states of the system undergo further Stark-splitting, modifying the equation for the energy levels to include the effect of the external field, as shown in equation (14).

2. The effective exchange splitting, denoted as 2?*, is found to be extremely small, allowing the effects of random electric fields F, generated by imperfections and crystalline strains within the piezoelectric host material, to become significant.

1. 当存在电场F时，系统的两个交换分裂状态将经历进一步的斯塔克分裂，修改等式以包含外部场的影响，如方程（14）所示。

2. 有效交换分裂，表示为2?*，被发现极其微小，使得由缺陷和晶格应变产生的随机电场F的影响变得不可忽视。
