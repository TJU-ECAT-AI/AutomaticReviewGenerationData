[1] "In the presence of a sufficiently strong electric field, i.e. for |F| > y*, the hole will be enforced to be almost entirely localized at one of the two GS oxygen sites."

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. This energy facilitates the oxidation process, increasing both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. When a strong electric field is applied, the hole is compelled to be almost exclusively localized at one of the two GS oxygen sites, thus affecting the oxidation reaction rate.

火星-克雷韦尔机制通过利用氧化物表面氧空位形成（ΔEv）释放的能量来操作。这种能量增强了氧化过程，提高了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当施加强大的电场时，电子洞几乎完全被锁定在两个GS氧原子位点之一，从而影响氧化反应速率。
