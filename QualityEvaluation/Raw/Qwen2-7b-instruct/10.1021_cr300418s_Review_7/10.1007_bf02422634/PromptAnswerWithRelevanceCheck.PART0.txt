[1] "In the presence of an electric field F, there will be a further Stark-splitting of the two exchange-split states of our "two-well" system. Eq. (13) should now be generalized to read
E•177
?V-('F)
2" (14)"

[2] "Now, the effective exchange splitting, to be labeled 2?*, turns out to be so small, that the effects resulting from random electric fields, F, which arise from imperfections and crystalline strains present in the piezoelectric host, can no longer be neglected."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

1. When an electric field F is present, the two exchange-split states of the system undergo further Stark-splitting, modifying the equation for the energy levels to include the effect of the external field, as shown in equation (14).

2. The effective exchange splitting, denoted as 2?*, is found to be extremely small, allowing the effects of random electric fields F, generated by imperfections and crystalline strains within the piezoelectric host material, to become significant.

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

1. 当存在电场F时，系统的两个交换分裂状态将经历进一步的斯塔克分裂，修改等式以包含外部场的影响，如方程（14）所示。

2. 有效交换分裂，表示为2?*，被发现极其微小，使得由缺陷和晶格应变产生的随机电场F的影响变得不可忽视。

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The trapped-hole center in smoky quartz is formed by a defect electron trapped at one of the four oxygen ligands around a substitutional aluminum impurity ion. Two of these oxygen sites form slightly deeper traps for the hole. If trapped at one of the remaining two ligands, the hole is in an excited state, z]E  0.030 eV. Thermally activated hopping of the hole among these oxygen sites accounts for the disappearance of the ESR spectrum, above 170 as well as for the occurrence of dielectric loss in smoky quartz.

烟雾石中的捕获空穴中心是由缺陷电子在铝杂质离子周围的四个氧配体之一中被囚禁形成的。其中两个氧位点对空穴形成较深的陷阱。如果被困在剩余的两个氧位点之一，空穴处于激发态，z]E  0.030 eV。热激活的空穴在这些氧位点之间的跳动解释了170以上ESR光谱的消失以及烟雾石中的介电损耗现象。

<p>In the analysis of the electron spin resonance spectrum of smoky quartz, it was found that the paramagnetic center is formed by a defect electron, trapped at one of the four oxygen ligands around a substitutional aluminum impurity ion.</p>
<p>The hole prefers to stay localized at the oxygen ligands, because the ionisation of an Al³⁺ ion would require more than 100 eV.</p>
<p>Thermally activated hopping of the hole among these oxygen sites accounts for the disappearance of the ESR-spectrum, above 170 as well as for the occurrence of dielectric loss in smoky quartz.</p>
<p>The electronic structure of the trapped hole center is discussed by crystal field theory, appropriate for an O⁻ ion, which also accounts adequately for the experimental g-shift data.</p>
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
The trapped-hole center in smoky quartz is formed by a defect electron captured at an oxygen ligand around a substitutional aluminum ion. The hole remains localized at the oxygen ligand due to the high energy barrier for ionizing the aluminum ion. The hopping of the hole among oxygen ligands leads to the disappearance of the electron spin resonance spectrum above 170 K, and it also causes dielectric loss in smoky quartz. The electronic structure of the trapped hole is analyzed using crystal field theory, which effectively explains the experimental g-shift data.

烟水晶中的捕获空穴中心由缺陷电子在替换铝离子周围的氧配体中捕获形成。空穴倾向于保留在氧配体上，因为离子化Al³⁺离子需要超过100 eV的能量。空穴在这些氧配体之间的跃迁导致了电子自旋共振谱在170 K以上消失，并且也在烟水晶中引起了介电损耗。通过晶场理论分析了捕获的空穴的电子结构，有效地解释了实验的g移位数据。

[1] "In the presence of a sufficiently strong electric field, i.e. for |F| > y*, the hole will be enforced to be almost entirely localized at one of the two GS oxygen sites."

</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>

The Mars-van Krevelen mechanism operates by utilizing the energy released from the formation of oxygen vacancies (ΔEv) on the oxide surface. This energy facilitates the oxidation process, increasing both the catalytic activity and the oxidizing power of the oxide surface. When a strong electric field is applied, the hole is compelled to be almost exclusively localized at one of the two GS oxygen sites, thus affecting the oxidation reaction rate.

</EnglishVersionAnswer>

<ChineseVersionAnswer>

火星-克雷韦尔机制通过利用氧化物表面氧空位形成（ΔEv）释放的能量来操作。这种能量增强了氧化过程，提高了氧化物表面的催化活性和氧化能力。当施加强大的电场时，电子洞几乎完全被锁定在两个GS氧原子位点之一，从而影响氧化反应速率。
