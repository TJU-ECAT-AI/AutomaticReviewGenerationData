[1] "In the present work, we carried out a similar DRIFT experiments for ethane adsorption and dehydrogenation on reduced gallium cations in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite and compared the obtained results with those for zinc modified ZSM-5 samples."
[2] "We have found that the activation of ethane over Ga1 and Zn21 cations proceeds via two dinstinctly different mechanisms."
[3] "The con- sequences of these different ways of alkane activation are evaluated by studying the catalytic conversion of ethane over zinc- and gallium-modified HZSM-5."
[4] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[5] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include understanding the complex interactions between the catalyst components and the reactants under dynamic operating conditions. These challenges are significant because they affect the structure-activity relationships in the catalytic system. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time insights into the catalyst's behavior without interrupting the process. These techniques enable researchers to monitor changes in the catalyst's composition, structure, and activity as the reaction progresses, thereby enhancing the understanding of the relationship between the catalyst's characteristics and its performance. By continuously tracking the catalyst's evolution, scientists can optimize the PDH process, improve catalyst efficiency, and develop more effective catalyst designs.
