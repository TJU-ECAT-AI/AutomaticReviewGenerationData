[1] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[2] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[3] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[4] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are the weak adsorption of hydrocarbons and the lack of observable Brnsted acidity upon hydrocarbon activation. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time insights into the dynamic changes in catalyst structure and activity during PDH processes. These techniques allow researchers to monitor the formation and reactivity of Ga species, such as Ga1 ions, and their interactions with hydrocarbons, thereby advancing our understanding of structure-activity relationships in Ga-based catalysts. For instance, the use of spectroscopic methods can detect the oxidative addition of hydrocarbons to Ga1 ions, leading to the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments that decompose into ethylene and gallium dihydrides. This process is stable and selective due to the absence of Brnsted acidity in Ga/ZSM-5, unlike the case with Zn/ZSM-5, which generates Brnsted acidity, causing coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，通过Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂的Ga物种表征的主要挑战是烃类吸附较弱以及激活过程中缺乏可观察到的Brnsted酸性。原位或操作中表征技术通过提供实时信息来克服这些挑战，这些信息是在PDH过程中的催化剂结构和活性动态变化中获得的。这些技术允许研究人员监控Ga物种（如Ga1离子）及其与烃类的相互作用的动态变化，从而推动我们对基于Ga催化剂的结构-活性关系的理解。例如，使用光谱方法可以检测到烃类在Ga1离子上的氧化加成，导致乙基和氢化物碎片的形成，这些碎片进一步分解为乙烯和镓二氢。由于Ga/ZSM-5中不存在Brnsted酸性，这一过程稳定且选择性高，而Zn/ZSM-5则会产生Brnsted酸性，导致结焦失活和次级芳构化反应。
