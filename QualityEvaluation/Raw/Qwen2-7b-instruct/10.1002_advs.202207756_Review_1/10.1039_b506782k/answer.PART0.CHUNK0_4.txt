<p>In our previous studies we concluded that the active sites for dissociative hydrogen1012 and methane13,14 or ethane disso- ciative adsorption and dehydrogenation15 over zinc-modified HZSM-5 are acidbase pairs involving low-coordinated biva- lent zinc cations located at isolated aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra and distantly separated basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Typically above 450 K, heterolytic dissociative adsorption of ethane takes place resulting in the formation of zincethyl fragments and acid protons that compensate the negative framework charge at the basic sites of the zeolite framework.</p>
<p>Over Zn/ZSM-5 ad- sorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating.</p>
<p>Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides.</p>

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the weak adsorption of propane and the lack of distinct spectroscopic signatures for Ga species. In situ or operando characterization techniques are crucial for overcoming these challenges. These techniques allow researchers to monitor the changes in catalyst properties and reactant distribution in real-time, providing insights into the dynamic processes occurring during PDH. By combining spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and electron microscopy with kinetic studies, scientists can better understand the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, including the formation of reactive intermediates, the role of specific Ga sites, and the evolution of the catalyst surface over time. This information is essential for optimizing catalyst performance and enhancing the efficiency of PDH processes.
