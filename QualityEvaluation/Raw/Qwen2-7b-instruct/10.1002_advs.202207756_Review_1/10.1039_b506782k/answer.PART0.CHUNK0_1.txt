[1] "In the present work, we carried out a similar DRIFT experiments for ethane adsorption and dehydrogenation on reduced gallium cations in Ga/ZSM-5 zeolite and compared the obtained results with those for zinc modified ZSM-5 samples."
[2] "The activation of ethane over Ga1 and Zn21 cations proceeds via two dinstinctly different mechanisms."
[3] "Over Zn/ZSM-5 ad- sorbed ethane is strongly polarized, leading to heterolytic dissociation into a zinc ethyl fragments and protons upon subsequent heating."
[4] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[5] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[6] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[7] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involve understanding the distinct roles and interactions of Ga species within the zeolite structure. These challenges are addressed through in situ or operando characterization techniques. Such methods allow researchers to monitor the catalyst's behavior in real-time, providing insights into the dynamic changes in Ga speciation under PDH conditions. By comparing the results with those obtained from zinc-modified catalysts, scientists can gain a clearer understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems. For instance, the different mechanisms of ethane activation on Zn/ZSM-5 versus Ga/ZSM-5 highlight the importance of Ga speciation in determining the efficiency and selectivity of the catalysts. The in situ techniques, therefore, play a crucial role in deciphering these mechanisms, enabling the optimization of catalyst design and performance for PDH applications.

在GA/H-ZSM-5催化剂下进行丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下的GA物种阐明的主要挑战涉及理解Zeolite结构中GA物种的特定作用和相互作用。通过原位或操作方法，研究人员可以实时监测催化剂的行为，提供有关GA物种动态变化的见解。通过将结果与锌改性催化剂的结果进行比较，科学家可以获得这些催化系统结构活性关系的更清晰理解。例如，Zn/ZSM-5与Ga/ZSM-5上乙烷激活的不同机制强调了GA物种在确定催化剂效率和选择性方面的重要性。因此，在原位技术中发挥关键作用，帮助解码这些机制，从而优化催化剂设计和PDH应用的性能。
