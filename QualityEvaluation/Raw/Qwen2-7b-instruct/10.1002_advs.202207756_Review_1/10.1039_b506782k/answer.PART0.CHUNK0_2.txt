[1] "In our previous studies we concluded that the active sites for dissociative hydrogen1012 and methane13,14 or ethane disso- ciative adsorption and dehydrogenation15 over zinc-modified HZSM-5 are acidbase pairs involving low-coordinated biva- lent zinc cations located at isolated aluminum-occupied oxygen tetrahedra and distantly separated basic oxygen atoms of the zeolite framework."
[2] "Ethane is strongly adsorbed on Zn/ZSM-5 at room temperature, leading to strong polarizability of the hydrocarbon. Upon heating, the complex dissociates readily over the Lewis acid Zn21basic oxygen pairs, regenerating Brnsted acid protons."
[3] "Ethane is only weakly adsorbed on reduced Ga/ZSM-5 and hydrocarbon activation is proposed to occur via oxidative addition over univalent Ga1 ions at elevated temperatures."
[4] "This results in the formation of ethyl and hydride fragments grafted to gallium, which decompose upon further heating into ethylene and gallium dihydrides."
[5] "The absence of Brnsted acid proton formation in Ga/ZSM-5 upon hydrocarbon activation results in the stable and selective conversion of ethane into ethylene."
[6] "On the other hand, Zn/ZSM-5 displays a higher initial activity but suffers from coking deactivation and secondary aromatization reactions due to the generation of Brnsted acidity."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are related to the weak adsorption of propane and the subsequent hydrocarbon activation process. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute significantly by providing real-time insights into the dynamic changes occurring within the catalyst during PDH reactions. These techniques allow researchers to monitor the formation, stability, and transformation of Ga species in real-time, thereby aiding in understanding the structure-activity relationships in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under PDH conditions. By continuously observing the behavior of Ga species, scientists can gain deeper insights into how the catalyst's activity and selectivity evolve, leading to advancements in optimizing the catalyst design and operation parameters for enhanced performance and efficiency in PDH processes.
