[3] "The reported appearance of Ga+ under reducing condi- tions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has led some authors to conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for al- kane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mecha- nism."
[4] "It is therefore of interest to determine whether these XANES shifts provide unambiguous evidence for the ex- istence of reduced gallium, or whether other, non-reductive events could give rise to similar changes in the XANES ab- sorption edge."
[5] "In order to better understand what species might give rise to the observed XANES spectra, a series of molecular GaIII) model compounds with different ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra examined."
[6] "These findings agree with observation in the literature of GaH bonds under catalytic conditions, suggesting that Ga3+ hydrides may be mechanistically relevant."
[7] "Considering these results, we believe it is likely that Ga3+ does not undergo reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehy- drogenation, and that CH bond activation on Ga3+ catalysts instead proceeds via non-redox, heterolytic cleavage or sigma- bond metathesis mechanisms involving Ga3+ alkyl and hydride intermediates."

1. The role of gallium cations in alkane activation is well understood, but the oxidation state and coordination environment of gallium under reaction conditions have been debated.

2. Spectral features previously attributed to GaI may be interpreted as evidence for low-coordinate GaIII alkyl or hydride species.

3. The presence of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has been proposed as essential for alkane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation through oxidative addition/reductive elimination.

4. The XANES shifts in Ga-zeolite catalysts under reducing conditions have led to speculation about the existence of reduced gallium, but they could also result from non-reductive events.

5. To better understand the species causing observed XANES spectra, a series of molecular GaIII model compounds with various ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra analyzed.

6. The findings align with the observation of GaH bonds in catalytic conditions, suggesting that Ga3+ hydrides could be relevant mechanistically.

7. Based on the results, it is likely that Ga3+ does not undergo reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehydrogenation, and CH bond activation on Ga3+ catalysts proceeds via non-redox, heterolytic cleavage or sigma-bond metathesis mechanisms involving Ga3+ alkyl and hydride intermediates.

1. 铝烷基化中镓离子的作用已为人所熟知，但在反应条件下的镓的氧化状态和配位环境一直存在争议。

2. 原来归因于GaI的光谱特征可能被解释为低配位GaIII烷基或氢物种的存在证据。

3. 在Ga-沸石催化剂中，当存在还原性条件时，发现Ga+的存在被认为对于烷烃脱氢是必要的，烷烃激活通过氧化插入/还原消除机制进行。

4. Ga-沸石催化剂在还原条件下出现的XANES位移导致有人推测存在还原的镓，但这些变化也可能由非还原事件引起。

5. 为了更好地理解观察到的XANES光谱所属的物种，一系列不同配体的分子GaIII模型化合物被合成并分析了它们的XANES光谱。

6. 这些发现与催化条件下观测到的GaH键一致，暗示Ga3+氢物种在机制上可能是相关的。

7. 根据结果，很可能Ga3+在烷烃脱氢过程中不会还原成Ga+，而是在Ga3+烷基和氢中间体涉及非还原、异裂或σ键互换机制下，通过非还原性，进行CH键激活。
