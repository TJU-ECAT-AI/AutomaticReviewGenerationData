[1] "The reported appearance of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has led some authors to conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for al- kane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mecha- nism.12,33,34"
[2] "However, a change in oxidation state is not the only factor that can give rise to a change in the XANES spectrum."
[3] "These findings apply both to gallium-impregnated zeolite catalysts and to silica-supported single site gal- lium catalysts, the latter of which is found to be active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane and hydrogenation of propylene."
[4] "Comparison of XANES spectra of molecular models to those of working catalysts,and interpretation of these spectra in terms of molecular or- bital theory, highlight the heretofore underappreciated im- portance of ligand effects in gallium K edge XANES, and the implications of these effects for characterization of catalyti- cally relevant species in gallium-based alkane dehydrogena- tion catalysts."
[5] "Importantly, ΔXANES spectra from both catalysts demonstrate that shifts to lower edge energy under reducing conditions arise from sequential formation of (at least) two separate species."
[6] "From the results presented in Fig. 6, it becomes possible to account for the results in Fig. 1 and 4 without invoking the presence of Ga+. A hypothesis involving only Ga3+ species is proposed in Fig. 9."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions involve interpreting changes in XANES spectra, which can be attributed not only to changes in oxidation state but also to ligand effects and coordination environment. Operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by allowing real-time monitoring of the catalysts' behavior under reaction conditions, thereby providing insights into structure-activity relationships. The literature demonstrates that shifts in XANES spectra under reducing conditions can be explained by changes in ligand identity and coordination number, rather than solely by oxidation state changes. This understanding advances our knowledge of Ga speciation and the mechanisms involved in PDH catalysis, indicating that Ga3+ species are likely responsible for the observed reactivity, and not Ga+.

在丙烷脱氢（PDH）条件下，确定Ga/H-ZSM-5催化剂中Ga物种的主要挑战涉及解释XANES光谱变化，这些变化不仅与氧化状态变化有关，还与配体效应和配位环境有关。原位表征技术通过允许实时监测催化剂在反应条件下的行为，从而克服了这些挑战，提供了有关结构-活性关系的见解。文献表明，在还原条件下光谱变化可以由配体性质和配位数的变化来解释，而不是仅仅由氧化态变化。这种理解促进了我们对Ga物种和PDH催化机制的了解，表明Ga3+物种可能是观察到的活性原因，而不是Ga+。
