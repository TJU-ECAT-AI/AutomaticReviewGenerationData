The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the complexity of the Ga species present, which makes their identification and quantification difficult. These challenges are compounded by the dynamic nature of the catalyst during PDH reactions, where the Ga species may change rapidly. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time data on the behavior of Ga species within the catalyst during PDH reactions. This allows researchers to gain insights into the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems, helping to optimize catalyst performance and understand the mechanisms of propane dehydrogenation.
