The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions include the difficulty in accurately identifying and quantifying gallium (Ga) ions within the catalyst structure. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by providing real-time insights into the catalyst's behavior during PDH reactions. These methods enable researchers to monitor the changes in Ga speciation and distribution as the reaction progresses, thereby advancing our understanding of the structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems.
