[1] "The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are multifaceted. These include the dynamic nature of gallium species, their rapid exchange with the surrounding environment, and the complexity of identifying stable Ga forms within the zeolite matrix."
[2] "In situ or operando characterization techniques have become indispensable tools in addressing these challenges. They enable real-time monitoring of the catalyst during operation, providing insights into the dynamic behavior of Ga species."
[3] "These techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), offer valuable information on the coordination environment, oxidation state, and spatial distribution of Ga ions within the catalyst."
