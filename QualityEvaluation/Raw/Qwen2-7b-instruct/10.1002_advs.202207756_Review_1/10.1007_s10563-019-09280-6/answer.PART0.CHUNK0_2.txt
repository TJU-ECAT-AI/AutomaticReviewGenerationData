[1] "The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC), while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydrogenation contributed 19%."
[2] "The shift to lighter, ethane-based feeds means that propylene production from steam crackers will be lower than the corresponding ethylene production."
[3] "Therefore, alternative technologies have to be developed to produce more propylene to make up for the shortfall from steam cracking."
[4] "This review looks at the steam catalytic cracking technology, which combines both catalytic cracking and steam cracking to maximize the production of light olefins."
[5] "The amount of steam used in steam catalytic cracking will hydrothermally deactivate conventional FCC catalysts, therefore, special catalyst capable of withstanding high temperatures and high amount of steam need to be developed for commercial applications."
[6] "In steam catalytic cracking, steam is used as an inexpensive diluent and also to decrease the amount of coke deposition on catalysts."
[7] "Steam catalytic cracking influences the yield of light olefins, but the degree of to which this is effected is also a function of operating conditions, such as reaction temperature, residence time, steam to oil weight ratio, catalyst to oil weight ratio, and partial pressure."
[8] "Steam catalytic cracking with molecular sieve based catalysts operates at lower temperatures than conventional steam cracking, thus providing energy savings."

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are the complexity of the Ga species present and the dynamic changes in their composition during the reaction. These challenges hinder the direct understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by allowing real-time monitoring of the catalyst's properties and the chemical environment of Ga species under PDH conditions. This enables researchers to correlate the catalyst's behavior with its structure, facilitating the advancement of our understanding of structure-activity relationships. By providing insights into how the catalyst's properties evolve during the reaction, these techniques help in optimizing the catalyst design and improving the PDH process efficiency.
