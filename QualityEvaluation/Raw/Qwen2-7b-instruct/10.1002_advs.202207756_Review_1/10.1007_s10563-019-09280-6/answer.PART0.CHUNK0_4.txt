[1] "Steam not only plays the function of a diluent and fluidizing gas, but it can also influence the product distribution."
[2] "Product distribution from steam catalytic cracking is also influenced by several factors such as catalyst, feedstocks properties and reaction parameters."
[3] "The review also shows that the reaction temperature of metal oxide based catalysts is commonly 50200C higher than that of molecular sieve based catalysts."

1. The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are attributed to the complexity of the catalyst structure and the dynamic changes in Ga species during the reaction. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute significantly by allowing real-time monitoring of the catalyst's state. These techniques help in understanding the structure-activity relationships by providing insights into how the catalyst's properties evolve over time under PDH conditions. By correlating these observations with the catalyst's performance, scientists can better predict and optimize the catalyst's behavior and activity.

2. In steam catalytic cracking technology, the influence of steam extends beyond serving as a diluent and fluidizing gas. Steam also impacts the product distribution, which is a critical aspect of the process. The product distribution is influenced by multiple factors including the type of catalyst employed, the characteristics of the feedstocks, and operational parameters. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing the production of light olefins and enhancing the overall efficiency of the cracking process.

3. Metal oxide-based catalysts typically operate at a higher temperature (around 50200°C) compared to molecular sieve-based catalysts in steam catalytic cracking. This difference in operating temperature reflects the distinct mechanisms and reaction pathways involved in these two types of catalysts. Lower temperatures for molecular sieve catalysts can lead to energy savings and greater flexibility in feedstock utilization, while also increasing the selectivity towards light olefins compared to conventional steam cracking methods.
