<p>Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The type of feedstock used in steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce less propylene, as illustrated in Table1 [2].</p>
<p>The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product.</p>
<p>Steam catalytic cracking is an alternative technology that combines useful aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to increase the yield of both ethylene and propylene at relatively lower temperatures than in steam cracking [3, 5].</p>
<p>Steam catalytic cracking influences the yield of light olefins, but the degree of to which this is effected is also a function of operating conditions, such as reaction temperature, residence time, steam to oil weight ratio, catalyst to oil weight ratio, and partial pressure.</p>
<p>Product distribution from steam catalytic cracking is also influenced by several factors such as catalyst, feedstocks properties and reaction parameters.</p>
<p>The aromaticity of a feed can be assessed from its BMCI [81, 82], a correlation index developed by the U.S. Bureau of Mines. The BMCI relates the average boiling point (mid boiling point) of a distillation fraction to its specific gravity as defined by the empirical formula in Eq.(5) below:</p>
<p>Feed is classified as paraffinic when it has a BMCI of 015; it is classified as an intermediate feed when its BMCI is 1550, while a BMCI above 50 means the feed is naphthenic and indicative of aromatic oils.</p>
<p>Steam catalytic cracking involves catalytic cracking reactions and thermal pyrolysis reactions, controlled by both the free radical mechanism and the carbonium ion mechanism.</p>
<p>It is possible to use the product distribution to establish the predominant mechanistic pathway for a particular steam catalytic cracking process.</p>

1. The use of lighter feedstocks in steam crackers typically results in a lower yield of propylene compared to heavier feedstocks. Ethane-based feeds are now preferred in steam crackers for their higher ethylene yield and reduced propylene production.

2. Steam catalytic cracking is an alternative method that combines aspects of catalytic cracking and steam cracking to increase the yield of both ethylene and propylene at lower temperatures than in traditional steam cracking processes.

3. Operating conditions, including reaction temperature, residence time, steam to oil weight ratio, catalyst to oil weight ratio, and partial pressure, significantly influence the yield of light olefins in steam catalytic cracking.

4. The product distribution in steam catalytic cracking is affected by multiple factors, including the catalyst used, properties of the feedstocks, and operational parameters.

5. The BMCI (Boiling Point Correlation Index) is a measure developed by the U.S. Bureau of Mines to classify feedstocks based on their aromaticity. Paraffinic feeds have a BMCI of 0-15, intermediate feeds have a BMCI of 15-50, and naphthenic (aromatic) feeds have a BMCI above 50.

6. Steam catalytic cracking utilizes both the free radical mechanism and the carbonium ion mechanism to control the cracking reactions.

7. Product distribution can be used to identify the dominant reaction pathway in steam catalytic cracking processes.

1. 使用较轻的原料在蒸汽裂解炉中通常会导致丙烯产量较低，相比于使用重质原料。现在，乙烯烷基原料被更偏好用于提高乙稀产量并减少副产的丙烯。

2. 蒸汽催化裂解是一种替代技术，结合了催化裂解和蒸汽裂解的优点，在比传统蒸汽裂解更低的温度下提高了乙稀和丙烯的产量。

3. 运行条件，包括反应温度、停留时间、蒸汽与油质量比、催化剂与油质量比以及部分压力，对蒸汽催化裂解过程中的轻烯烃产量有显著影响。

4. 蒸汽催化裂解的产品分布受到多种因素的影响，包括所使用的催化剂、原料特性以及操作参数。

5. BMCI（沸点相关指数）是由美国矿业局开发的一种衡量标准，用于根据分馏组分的平均沸点（中间沸点）及其特定重量定义的公式来分类原料的芳香性。当BMCI为0-15时，原料被认为是石蜡型；当BMCI为15-50时，原料被认为是中间型；而当BMCI超过50时，原料被认为是环烷型，指示了芳烃的存在。

6. 蒸汽催化裂解利用自由基机制和碳离子机制控制裂解反应。

7. 可以通过产品分布来识别蒸汽催化裂解过程中的主导反应途径。
