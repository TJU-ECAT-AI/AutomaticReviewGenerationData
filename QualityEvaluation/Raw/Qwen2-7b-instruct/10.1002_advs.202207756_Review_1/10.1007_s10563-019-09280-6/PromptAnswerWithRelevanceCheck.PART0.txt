The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC),while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydroge- nation contributed 19%. Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The type of feedstock used in steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce less propylene, as illustrated in Table1 [2]. The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product.

The traditional methods for propylene production rely heavily on steam cracking, accounting for 50% of total propylene production, while fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) contributes 31%. On-purpose technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation, make up the remaining 19%. Propylene is typically produced as a by-product in steam crackers and FCC units, alongside ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The yield of propylene is influenced by the type of feedstock used in steam crackers. Heavier feedstocks result in higher propylene production, whereas lighter feedstocks, like ethane, produce less propylene. Ethane-based feeds are increasingly used in steam crackers due to their ability to yield more ethylene with significantly less propylene as a by-product.

Although for different steam catalytic reactors the yields of olefins are different, the laws of olefin yields that change along with operating conditions are uniform. Steam catalytic cracking with molecular sieve based catalysts operates at lower temperatures than convention steam cracking, thus providing energy savings. It also provides flexibility in terms of feeds and can further increase the selectivity to light olefins compared to conventional steam cracking.

The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are the complexity of the Ga species present and the dynamic changes in their composition during the reaction. These challenges hinder the direct understanding of structure-activity relationships in these catalytic systems. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute to overcoming these challenges by allowing real-time monitoring of the catalyst's properties and the chemical environment of Ga species under PDH conditions. This enables researchers to correlate the catalyst's behavior with its structure, facilitating the advancement of our understanding of structure-activity relationships. By providing insights into how the catalyst's properties evolve during the reaction, these techniques help in optimizing the catalyst design and improving the PDH process efficiency.

4. The product distribution in steam catalytic cracking is affected by multiple factors, including the catalyst used, properties of the feedstocks, and operational parameters.

5. The BMCI (Boiling Point Correlation Index) is a measure developed by the U.S. Bureau of Mines to classify feedstocks based on their aromaticity. Paraffinic feeds have a BMCI of 0-15, intermediate feeds have a BMCI of 15-50, and naphthenic (aromatic) feeds have a BMCI above 50.

6. Steam catalytic cracking utilizes both the free radical mechanism and the carbonium ion mechanism to control the cracking reactions.

1. The primary challenges in elucidating Ga speciation in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts under propane dehydrogenation (PDH) conditions are attributed to the complexity of the catalyst structure and the dynamic changes in Ga species during the reaction. In situ or operando characterization techniques contribute significantly by allowing real-time monitoring of the catalyst's state. These techniques help in understanding the structure-activity relationships by providing insights into how the catalyst's properties evolve over time under PDH conditions. By correlating these observations with the catalyst's performance, scientists can better predict and optimize the catalyst's behavior and activity.

2. In steam catalytic cracking technology, the influence of steam extends beyond serving as a diluent and fluidizing gas. Steam also impacts the product distribution, which is a critical aspect of the process. The product distribution is influenced by multiple factors including the type of catalyst employed, the characteristics of the feedstocks, and operational parameters. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing the production of light olefins and enhancing the overall efficiency of the cracking process.

3. Metal oxide-based catalysts typically operate at a higher temperature (around 50200°C) compared to molecular sieve-based catalysts in steam catalytic cracking. This difference in operating temperature reflects the distinct mechanisms and reaction pathways involved in these two types of catalysts. Lower temperatures for molecular sieve catalysts can lead to energy savings and greater flexibility in feedstock utilization, while also increasing the selectivity towards light olefins compared to conventional steam cracking methods.
