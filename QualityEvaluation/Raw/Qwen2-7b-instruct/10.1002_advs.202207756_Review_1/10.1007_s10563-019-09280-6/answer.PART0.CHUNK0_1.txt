The traditional routes accounted for 81% propylene production (with 50% from steam cracking and 31% from FCC),while the on-purpose technologies like propane dehydroge- nation contributed 19%. Propylene is usually obtained as by-product from steam crackers and FCC units which produce with mainly ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The type of feedstock used in steam crackers affect the yield of propylene. While heavy feeds produce more propylene, lighter feeds tend to produce less propylene, as illustrated in Table1 [2]. The recent trend in steam crackers has been the use of ethane-based feeds which guarantee a bigger yield of ethylene, with far less propylene being produced as a by-product.

The traditional methods for propylene production rely heavily on steam cracking, accounting for 50% of total propylene production, while fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) contributes 31%. On-purpose technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation, make up the remaining 19%. Propylene is typically produced as a by-product in steam crackers and FCC units, alongside ethylene and gasoline, respectively. The yield of propylene is influenced by the type of feedstock used in steam crackers. Heavier feedstocks result in higher propylene production, whereas lighter feedstocks, like ethane, produce less propylene. Ethane-based feeds are increasingly used in steam crackers due to their ability to yield more ethylene with significantly less propylene as a by-product.

传统的丙烯生产方法主要依赖蒸汽裂解，占总丙烯产量的50%，而流化床催化裂化（FCC）贡献了31%。目标定向技术，如丙烷脱氢，占剩余的19%。丙烯通常作为副产品在蒸汽裂解器和FCC单元中产生，与乙烯和汽油一起。丙烯的产率受到蒸汽裂解器所用原料类型的影响。较重的原料导致较高的丙烯产量，而较轻的原料（如乙烷）产生的丙烯较少。由于能够产生更多乙烯并显著减少丙烯副产品，乙烷基原料在蒸汽裂解器中的使用越来越多。

The role steam plays in steam catalytic cracking technology. It shows that steam not only plays the function of a diluent and fluidizing gas, but it can also influence the product distribution. Product distribution from steam catalytic cracking is also influenced by several factors such as catalyst, feedstocks properties and reaction parameters.

Although for different steam catalytic reactors the yields of olefins are different, the laws of olefin yields that change along with operating conditions are uniform. Steam catalytic cracking with molecular sieve based catalysts operates at lower temperatures than convention steam cracking, thus providing energy savings. It also provides flexibility in terms of feeds and can further increase the selectivity to light olefins compared to conventional steam cracking.
</quotes>

<EnglishVersionAnswer>
While the yields of olefins may vary across different steam catalytic reactors, the principles governing changes in olefin yields with operational conditions remain consistent. Steam catalytic cracking utilizing molecular sieve catalysts operates at cooler temperatures than conventional steam cracking, offering energy efficiency. Additionally, this method offers greater feed versatility and enhanced selectivity towards light olefins compared to traditional steam cracking.
